[{"date":"5 January 2011","score":"","review":" (Credit IMDb) Nearly two years after having gone amiss in Africa, renowned anthropologist Dr. Ethan Powell is caught committing a crime and subsequently imprisoned in a Florida mental institution, where aspiring psychiatrist Dr. Theo Calder takes over his important case. Dr. Powell, who has been with a group of gorillas during all that time, is not talking at all and seems to be living in a dream world. Very slowly, Dr. Calder manages to reach Ethan Powell and starts finding out why Ethan killed two of the poachers. Yet Theo's case is not just about why the murders have happened, but also about how Dr. Powell became the being he is in the first place. With Ethan's silence broken, Theo is introduced into a world beyond common human comprehension The true nature of being. He learns that mankind's control of everything is a mere illusion and that the true values of existence can't be found so easily. Ethan changes Theo's view of things forever.Instinct is a powerful film, which succeeds more often then not. I've seen critics bash this film, and IMDb reviewers themselves, and for what? It's got a strong story, a great background story regarding Hopkins, and whenever those two interacted I was on the edge of my seat. I was also really touched by some of the flashback scenes with Hopkins and the Gorilla's, it was very well done. What starts off as a power struggle between Cuba and Hopkins turns into a unique and beautiful friendship, and I loved the way it went down. This is one of Cuba's most underrated movies, and I don't get the disdain for it.Performances. Anthony Hopkins is excellent here, as usual. His intensity knows no bounds, and I always felt alert and glued to my seat whenever his presence was on my T.V screen. His chemistry with Cuba was great as well. Cuba Gooding is very effective here, giving one of his finest performances in his hey-day of success. I've always been a big fan of his, and wish his work was fine these days such as this one. Donald Sutherland is wasted in a bit role here, he was OK. Maura Tierney is good in her limited screen time.Bottom line. I don't get why people dislike this movie, it's got everything I want in a Dramatization. Hopefully you'll be like me, and see this movie for what I feel it is, a really good film. Very much recommended.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"5 January 2011","score":"","review":" (Credit IMDb) Nearly two years after having gone amiss in Africa, renowned anthropologist Dr. Ethan Powell is caught committing a crime and subsequently imprisoned in a Florida mental institution, where aspiring psychiatrist Dr. Theo Calder takes over his important case.

Not only did he give the performance of the year as Cool Hand Luke, but embodied the role of action antihero in this gritty, downbeat western as the laconic part-Apache John Russell, reluctant helper of assorted, sordid white people.Russell has been living off the land with his Apache brethren when he is left a boarding house in a will. Russell sells the boarding house, which leaves its beautiful-but-weathered caretaker Jessie (Diane Cilento) on a long stage ride with Russell and a number of others with varied reasons for wanting to leave town. Unfortunately for everyone, one of them is a particularly ornery character named Cicero Grimes (Richard Boone).Hombre is a coming-out party of sorts for writer Elmore Leonard; he had works adapted for screen before, most notably 310 To Yuma, but Hombre brings out the quotability and toughness we associate with Leonard today. Credit Newman and director Martin Ritt, as well as cinematographer James Wong Howe, for giving the film the space and terse energy it needs to deliver the action without underselling the human drama. Russell doesn't want to stick his neck out for people, and you don't blame him, yet you understand why he helps them in the end.Screenwriters Harriet Frank and Irving Ravetch provide many memorable lines. A favorite, when a thief is being robbed at gunpoint It looks like you did good and we did better. But there's a tendency to overexposition, of people giving their life story at a drop of a hat. Everyone except Russell, who keeps it very cool throughout. Maybe it helps Newman look better.Takes a lot to light a fire under you, don't it? Jessie asks him.The story doesn't exactly hold together well upon reflection, and there are a number of what Hitchcock called icebox scenes. One character walks around for days after being gutshot. Another is developed at length without having anything to do with the story except dying in it. But with icebox scenes you don't notice the incongruities until later. You are caught up with the energy and vitality, especially when things begin to happen in the second hour.Newman is working Eastwood\/McQueen territory here, and working it quite well. An important conflict in the film pits him against Dr. Favor (Fredric March), a self-righteous Indian agent who looks down on Russell for his American Indian roots despite the fact Favor has done well off the Apaches. When Favor's jaded wife (Barbara Rush) scoffs at the Apaches for eating dogs, Russell tells her if she was as hungry as they were, you'd eat it. You'd fight for the bones, too. Newman doesn't raise his voice, doesn't even lean forward, but his burning blues make his anger palpable.Rush's character is especially interesting, a reflection perhaps on the classic Leonard opportunistic female, or maybe even worse. I'm still not sure what she was playing at, but I enjoyed her character enormously. With Cilento, March, and especially Boone as well, you have performances that would provide engaging centers for other films, yet Newman towers over them without resorting to histrionics or even much in the way of humor (his wisecracks are few, however well-placed.)Hombre is a near-classic Western that doesn't play by classic rules. But it makes its points well, keeps you involved, and allows you to relish one of Paul Newman's most indelible roles.
