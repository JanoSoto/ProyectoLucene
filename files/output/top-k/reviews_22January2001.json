Did I miss something? The movie is decent compared to old 70's and 80's kung fu flicks, only it tried to provide some sort of plot that doesn't work in any sense. The characters seem to move about as if there was a great busing system and they toss in a lengthy back story about the young girl and the nomad only to never really use the nomad character again.   The effects are no where near spectacular and i've seen better fight scenes a thousand times, again, in old Kung Fu movies.Next, Wudan is supposed to be some sacred art but everyone can do it.  And one lady learns it entirely from a book and then teaches it to another woman who apparently learned it well enough to keep up with the great swords man played by Chow Fat.  Thats one very well written book, let me tell you. On top of that the little girl learns it on her spare time.  I guess all that meditating isn't really needed is it.  Just grab a copy of the book and when you can, slip in a couple of training sessions here and there and BAM! You can do Wudan too! Then, my biggest gripe, the story telling.  The whole movie builds this sense that Chow and Jade Fox must fight and then they cheat you with that ending that takes five seconds.   Chow is hit with a poison dart and knows he will die!!! The horror.  Did anyone bother to think that maybe Jade Fox would have been smart enough to keep an antidote close to her in the slight chance that while making all ten thousand darts she may get pricked??? But no, so the little girl knows how to make it and decides to ride a horse (did anyone remember that she can essentially fly) to go get it and now, after everyone has seemingly been moving from place to place with no sign of travel time she takes an eternity to get the antidote.  Just enough time for Chow and Michelle Yeoh to say what they have to say before he dies and she continues on with her life of never loving him.  THEN! Which is the most bizarre moment, the little girl jumps off a bridge.  Leaving Michelle Yeoh and the nomad guy.  I guess they'll team up in the sequel.The movie is, plain and simple, a typical kung fu movie with american production values, meaning a big budget.  If you like Kung fu movies then knock yourself out, it was fun to watch.

WHY did Sony put up money for a movie that has been done better for way less money, hundreds of times.P.S.

Having said that, it definitely wasn't the worst. I've been playing D&D for over two decades and went to see the movie on that basis. I was not disappointed, except for the low quality of acting especially the absolutely over-the-top melodramatic over-acting from Jeremy Irons. All of these actors have produced great work - I can only blame the director for some wooden and rudderless scenes. On the other hand - Tom Baker's cameo was just right. Well done, Doctor...I went into this movie with the same mindset as when I play D&D. Some players are good role-players, some are humorous and some are clever. None are all of these. It's up to each player (in the case of the movie - the audience) to get the most from what is presented. The movie fit that expectation nicely, as I could ignore the bits that were ham-fisted and look at what each event added to the experience. The dwarf was of no benefit to the story at all, but provided some excellent light relief. The magic was well represented with most spells recognisable (loved the effects!), and fitting well to the D&D verbal\/somatic\/material requirements, even though the material component was a non-specific 'pixie-dust'. But hey! this is a movie - I didn't expect the 15 minute rule debates we get in our games. Some simplification kept the story rolling along - which was necessary as some bits were reaaaaalllly slooooow.The dragon CGI was excellent, but they are supposed to be rare in D&D and the sight of so many was a little unbalancing to me.While the characters' racial and class attributes were a little under-played (possibly to keep the pace up), you could definitely see the fighter\/thief checking for traps; the ranger tracking; the mage getting flattened by the first blow in combat and the dwarf getting his blood up and just hitting whatever moved.Before seeing D&D, I was a bit put off by a criticism of the maze. It most definitely IS a maze (def A network of paths designed as a puzzle), although not the traditional English hedge type.All in all, a good effort. If you go into the movie expecting it to be a great movie or a great D&D game on a screen, then you'll be disappointed.

Die Hard 2 was so highly anticipated that the theaters actually started showing it a day or two (can't remember) early.  To me, that one lived up to its predecessor's legacy.  It maintained the claustrophobic feel while mixing up the formula.  (And that airplane crash scene gave me chills!)Die Hard with a Vengeance completely abandons the claustrophobia that made the DH films unique.  Instead of a hero with geographical limitations, we get a hero with chronological limitations.  (Most of his Herculean labors must be accomplished within a certain time frame or something bad will happen.)  So what's different about that?  At least half the thrillers of all time involve some sort of time limit.  So in abandoning its heritage, DH3 loses its identity.Despite that, DH3 almost succeeds in creating a new identity of its own.  In a rarity for action thrillers, we actually watch each heroic effort wondering if John McClane will succeed, as he doesn't succeed every time.  However, the movie abruptly stops these challenges about halfway through, and the rest of the movie is just generic, stunt-filled cat-and-mouse fare.The other level on which this movie fails is in showing us bleak futures for characters we love.

In my opinion the best director to dance such a tango is Oliver Stone. His movies run like documentaries with fact flashes, but at the same time you are involved in the drama acted out on the screen. In this movie, Norman Jewison succeeds to some extent in building the drama in the beginning, but as the film progresses it starts fizzling out. As Rubin comes into contact with his Canadian friends the story slows down. The canadians as it has been pointed out by somebody aren't convincing in the filme at all. I found the young canadian friend particularly irritating. I didn't like the way Rubin's life is been shown through the reading of this boy. It looks mushy. The way all the 4 canadians are shown to be together all the time, like a happy lil family is so synthetic. No motivation, no justification has been established for the canadians to come to Carter's rescue. Towards the end, the movie does get a lil better.

I'd seen the 1969 version with Nicol Williamson as Hamlet and considered that a good interpretation, so I was interested to see what Branagh would bring to the play.If definitive means used the entire play and didn't cut anything out, then this is absolutely the definitive Hamlet.  There's nothing worse than Hollywood getting its hands on a good play or novel and cutting it into something unrecognizable (poor, poor Dune.)  Although sometimes the four hours seemed to drag a little, the knowledge that these were truly Shakespeare's words, and not some editor's, made the time worth spending on one movie.Despite the faithfulness to the play, I would not call this the definitive Hamlet.  I enjoyed it very much, and there were certain elements which I think were wonderful, but there are also elements that keep me from calling this the best version of Hamlet.  The main problem I have with the movie is Branagh himself.  He is an extremely talented actor, and it was clear that he had given much thought and dedication to his work.  However, during all of his soliloquies, I kept expecting him to pause in the middle and say Wait, are you sure you're getting my good side?  There are many stars capable of directing and starring in a movie without any signs of vanity or ego.  For example, when I saw Braveheart, Mel Gibson's acting so impressed me, I completely forgot he also directed it.  However, it was always clear that Kenneth Branagh was the director.  Also, Hamlet is the melancholy Dane.  He is depressed about his father's death, about Claudius taking his place in the line of succession, about his mother's obvious fickleness.  Not only that, but the character of Hamlet seems to be very thoughtful and introspective.  Branagh's Hamlet was, first and foremost, angry.  He screamed and raged when I would have expected mourning or pensiveness.  Depression and anger are two very different emotions.  However, there were times when Branagh's portrayal of Hamlet seemed inspired.  In any scene where hysteria or madness was called for (for example, when the players performed for the king) he was perfect.  His performance just left me wanting to see more of a tormented soul and less of rage.  Also, did the ghost have to whisper the whole time?  It got really annoying after awhile.However, there was much in this film that was wonderful.  Derek Jacobi really made Claudius three-dimensional.  I actually found myself feeling sorry for him a few times.  The scenery was amazing; the lightness of the castle really contrasted with Hamlet in all black.  The to be or not to be speech, as well as the get thee to a nunnery scene in the hall of mirrors was incredible.  In my opinion, the crowning glory of this film was Kate Winslet as Ophelia.  She was heartbreaking.  Also, the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia was potrayed perfectly.  Some people have a problem with the intimate scenes in the film, but I think they add to the relationship.  In the 1969 version especially, Ophelia seems almost indifferent to Hamlet.  In this film, it was obvious that Ophelia loved Hamlet deeply.  That, and the hesitating way she thought I will obey when ordered by her father to stop seeing him, make her insanity much more believable.  She had lost the love of her life already; the death of Polonius was the last straw.I enjoyed this film very much, and I plan on buying it for my collection in the future.  It was, overall, an excellent interpretation of Hamlet.  Is it the best one?  I don't believe so, but by all means see it and decide for yourself.

She was heartbreaking.  Also, the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia was potrayed perfectly.  Some people have a problem with the intimate scenes in the film, but I think they add to the relationship.  In the 1969 version especially, Ophelia seems almost indifferent to Hamlet.  In this film, it was obvious that Ophelia loved Hamlet deeply.  That, and the hesitating way she thought I will obey when ordered by her father to stop seeing him, make her insanity much more believable.  She had lost the love of her life already; the death of Polonius was the last straw.I enjoyed this film very much, and I plan on buying it for my collection in the future.  It was, overall, an excellent interpretation of Hamlet.  Is it the best one?  I don't believe so, but by all means see it and decide for yourself.  Four hours is a long time to give to a movie, but it's worth it.
