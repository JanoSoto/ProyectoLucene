Kirk Douglas stars as the eponymous hero, a troll-like biter of Roman's ankles when we first meet him, who is transformed into a svelte and charismatic leader of an army of slaves. Needless to say, this being a Hollywood studio movie, the story told here plays pretty fast and loose with the truth. Major characters, such as Verinia and Antoninus are pure invention, and the film has created something of a myth about the real Spartacus who was apparently a Roman deserter who was sold into slavery upon his capture and sent to Batiatus's gladiator training school. Gracchus (a wonderfully written part played with typical skill by Charles Laughton) did exist &#150; but about 50 years before the slaves' uprising. It's a shame that writer Dalton Trumbo and executive producer Douglas felt it necessary to add these invented characters, as they provide the weakest strands of the story. Jean Simmons is miscast in the part of Verinia she's too demure and fragile-looking, too much the English lady you'd expect to find pouring tea in the garden instead of wine in the atrium. Her part is not particularly well written, either &#150; too passive, even in her scenes with Olivier after the final battle. The character of Antoninus, played with little distinction by a too-old-for-the-part Tony Curtis &#150; whose occasional forays into historical epics were never successful &#150; is superfluous to the plot, and his only function seems to be to provide the writers with a means of demonstrating the sexual mores of Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier &#150; another strong performance), the political foe of Gracchus, who represents the autocratic alternative to Gracchus's democratic ideal. Having abandoned his position as Crassus's body servant, Antoninus joins up with Spartacus and accompanies him to the very end. It's difficult to understand why Trumbo didn't simply merge the characters of Crixus (John Ireland), Spartacus's fellow gladiator and friend, and Antoninus, and find some other way to convey the nature of Crassus's character and ambition for Rome.The political intrigues provide by far the more interesting aspect of the story, and were probably more important to Douglas than the emotional side, which seems to have been incorporated as a sop to the studio's need for a box office return. The intrigue and machinations of Crassus and the wily old senator Gracchus are never less than completely absorbing, whereas the emotional sub-plots rarely rise above the level of some biblical potboiler. For me, Laughton's performance far outshines that of Oscar winner Peter Ustinov (who nevertheless gives a terrific performance as Lentulus Batiatus, the cowardly owner of the gladiator school in which the slaves' revolt is born) and it's a mystery how he never received even a nomination for any major award for the part. Kirk Douglas, resists the temptation to grandstand for the most part in what could so easily have become a showy role, and works hard to show the man behind the myth. Russ Metty's superb cinematography never fails to do justice to the scale and scope of the story, and Alex North's score is justifiably celebrated.While it's not without its shortcomings &#150; not least of which is its protracted running time &#150; SPARTACUS is deserving of the praise it has received over the years, and its reputation will no doubt continue to be enhanced in years to come.

I was reluctant at first, since I find most thrillers to follow along the same lines, but my friend told me that this film was really different.My friend was wrong. This film isn't different at all. This is basically your standard Ashley Judd thriller, except that it's anime. If you're familiar with anime, this film won't even make you budge. There's a scene where there's a dead body in an elevator. They way it was shown wasn't really shocking at all, even though that was obviously it's intent. Had it been filmed in live action, however, it would have made a very nice shot, which would probably have lingered with you for a long time afterwards. But in other scenes, the director goes all out anime and just lets there be blood spurting in every director. No matter what, it's not original, and we're all yawning twenty minutes into the film.The plot follows Mima, a singer in a pop band called CHAM!. In the beginning of the film, Mima announces that she is going to retire from the pop scene and try to strike out as an actor instead. So she enters a TV-series called Double Bind, which is basically a thriller series. But not all of Mimas fans are happy with her decision to become an actress, and some feel that she is a traitor for giving up on the band. One fan takes the step to far as he begins to send her threats, and even harms some people around Mima. It is all to much for Mima, who eventually starts seeing illusions of herself, prancing around in her old CHAM!-dress. What follows is a series of events where we aren't sure what's real, who's killing who and why this is happening. In the end, only one thing is explained for sure, whereas all the rest is left open for interpretation.But, by the end, you won't care anymore. You'll be snoring already. In fact, the second the end credits rolled, I hit the stop button, obviously disappointed and went to tell the world what a dull movie this is. Sure, the plot may not be exactly that of other thrillers, but it's close enough. Add to that, it brings absolutely nothing new with it.

Wilder's script gives him plenty of opportunity to shine. His typically witty quip to servant Erich Von Stroheim is I sure drove into an interesting driveway (after realizing Swanson intends to hold a funeral for her pet monkey). It's the kind of remark that stays with you through the entire story.Holden inhabits the role so perfectly that we can be thankful Montgomery Clift turned down the role at the last moment. And the screenplay by Billy Wilder provides plenty of other cynical and observant wise cracks that give his character of Joe Gillis such depth, conviction and truth.And, of course, GLORIA SWANSON, as Norma Desmond, in what has to be regarded as her film swansong (she did very little thereafter), is every inch the faded silent screen star who lives inside her rich imagination, inflating her ego with self-important phrases like It's the pictures that got small. With her cat-like eyes and claw-like hand gestures, she gets every nuance out of a role that is theatrical and larger than life, right up to the fantastic ending. One can almost sense why Andrew Lloyd Webber would fashion this into a terrific Broadway musical.Her meeting with Cecil B. DeMille on the set of a Paramount costume epic is priceless for the way it is written and played. When, at the conclusion of the film, she says I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille, it's a truly poignant moment.All of the supporting players are excellent, including NANCY OLSON, as the writer girlfriend that Holden shields from the truth until that final scene where he invites her to come over to the Sunset Blvd. mansion and exposes the sordid truth of his relationship with Swanson.As the man servant who is Swanson's loyal protector and was once Swanson's first husband and director of her early films, ERICH VON STROHEIM easily matches Holden and Swanson with a fine characterization of the patiently devoted butler.Swanson plays the demented star like a more glamorous version of Miss Havisham in GREAT EXPECTATIONS, the woman who lived among the cobwebs because of a bitter disappointment when a lover jilted her on her wedding day. And like Miss Havisham, she refuses to deal with the reality of her situation when the going gets rough--as it does when it turns out nobody wants her at the studios any more, they were only interested in her antique auto.Some old time Hollywoodians get some cameos (Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner) which give the film added interest and even Hedda Hopper is on the scene as a brusque Hollywood reporter. All of the technical details are perfect. Franz Waxman's score has a Salome-like flavor, especially toward the end when Swanson is in the full throes of her delusions.Expertly photographed, written, directed and acted, this is a film that has to be watched closely to fully appreciate every detail. With its superior script, it mixes film noir, black comedy and dark melodrama with a nice blend of shadowy noir B&W photography, that has that Paramount sheen. A viewer is immediately drawn into the story which gets off to a brilliant start with Holden's brittle narration, the kind that strips all the phoniness away from any Hollywood pretension of glamor. Summing up Highly recommended for mature adults. Holden's corpse floating face downward, eyes open in the water of the lighted swimming pool, is the stylish stuff that film noir addicts dream of.And Swanson's brief moment mimicking Charlie Chaplin is priceless.Trivia note Holden's performance is right on target--the perfect degree of cynicism, disdain and self-loathing.

Warner) which give the film added interest and even Hedda Hopper is on the scene as a brusque Hollywood reporter. All of the technical details are perfect. Franz Waxman's score has a Salome-like flavor, especially toward the end when Swanson is in the full throes of her delusions.Expertly photographed, written, directed and acted, this is a film that has to be watched closely to fully appreciate every detail. With its superior script, it mixes film noir, black comedy and dark melodrama with a nice blend of shadowy noir B&W photography, that has that Paramount sheen. A viewer is immediately drawn into the story which gets off to a brilliant start with Holden's brittle narration, the kind that strips all the phoniness away from any Hollywood pretension of glamor. Summing up Highly recommended for mature adults. Holden's corpse floating face downward, eyes open in the water of the lighted swimming pool, is the stylish stuff that film noir addicts dream of.And Swanson's brief moment mimicking Charlie Chaplin is priceless.Trivia note Holden's performance is right on target--the perfect degree of cynicism, disdain and self-loathing. He should have won an Oscar here.

May have taken exception with some of the special effects. It did not bother me as they may total about 60 seconds of screen time.The story itself is quite interesting with Tippi playing the frigid woman with her mother's twisted thoughts ingrained in her since childhood. Of course this is just the McGuffin anyway. The interesting part of the movie, for me, was the foreplay between Connery and Tippi. The film may have gone a little too long but it was very watchable and contained a number of very interesting sequences. The scene where Tippi robs the safe is a case in point. It was such a small scene that I found very suspenseful. It is unfortunate that films today do not allow director's to take such license. The MTV generation is not capable of sitting still for three minutes to watch such a sequence. The editing and sound, the lack thereof, are brilliant.One negative thing that I did find was Bernard Herrmann's Music. I am one of his biggest fans but I found the music a little over the time at certain times - particularly during the opening title sequence.

The film exists only to give people something hypothetical to talk about over dinner or drinks once it is over. There is nothing redeeming either in the acting or technical departments to raise the material above the level of soap opera. The plot, as most people know, centers around a wealthy business tycoon (Redford) offering a young couple (Moore and Harrelson) $1,000,000 if she agrees to sleep with him one night. Obviously, they agree to the offer or this film would have never been made.The main problem stems from the fact that there isn't enough story here for an entire movie. Once the bet is agreed to and worked out, where do we go with it? The writers turn the film into a ridiculously sappy flood of emotions and over-acting that can only end in the most predictable way. It doesn't take a genius to see where the script is going to end up.The acting is part of the problem, as well. Redford probably thinks his performance is suave and charming, but a better word would be just smug. There is nothing about his character that is likable or even interesting. I doubt his character was supposed to be likable, but I'm sure he wasn't supposed to come off as wooden as he does. Demi Moore is fine as the young woman. And physically she's as adorable as ever. What a babe! Harrelson, however, is so unbelievably awful that I feel truly embarrassed for him whenever this film comes on. He's a whining; jealous jerk who should have stopped the whole thing from happening if his wife meant that much to him. His performance is nothing short of grating.The film made a ton of $$$$, so who am I to criticize it? Just some sap who was duped into taking his girlfriend to it way back in 1993. At least I scored when we got home. So I guess there was one redeeming quality about this sap fest.The Hound will give it 4 of 10 stars. That's more than generous.

Really, what else could you possibly need in a film?The plot starts out simply enough six college seniors get invited to attend a late-night showing of the exhibits in a new waxworks building. But the characters in each of the displays are much more lifelike than they seem and when you step past the railing into the displays, you're taken into an illusionary world where the characters live, breathe... and kill.Pretty creepy, huh?Among the main cast members are Zach Galligan as Mark, Foreman as Sarah, David Warner as the Waxwork's owner Mr. David Lincoln, Dana Ashbrook as Tony, Michelle Johnson as Mark's ex-girlfriend China, Miles O'Keeffe as Count Dracula (or, as he's known as in this film, The Count), John Rhys-Davies as a werewolf, J. Kenneth Campbell as the Marquis de Sade and Patrick Macnee as Sir Wilfred, Mark's godfather. While Ashbrook and Macnee give good performances with their roles, it is Foreman and Warner who give the best performances. Galligan, though, gives as good wooden acting as any actor in the modern day Star Wars prequel films.Among the many good moments in the film, we get a few good one-liners in the mostly serious horror flick, good acting, a clever plot, likable characters and a truly frightening, though brief, black-and-white sequence with zombies! The musical score by Roger Bellon is also especially impressive for such a B-budgeted horror movie (particularly the main theme and the Mark and Sarah theme which is heard twice, when Mark is with Sarah outside her apartment and then when Mark takes Sarah's hand in the de Sade exhibit and leaves the display with her).Of the bad parts, we get some less-than-impressive cardboard sets, a werewolf that looks like a Muppet on steroids, lipstick-looking lashes on Sarah's back when she is whipped in the Marquis display (and the mentioned injuries curiously disappear when she leaves the display) and plot holes big enough to drive cars through. For example, the Marquis display hypnotizes Sarah when she stares at it and steps inside of it, but the others do not get hypnotized by their displays. Also, some gore is unnecessary (do we really need to see a hunter being torn in half by a werewolf?).Still, despite its flaws, Waxwork is a wonderful horror film that scares as much as it entertains.

It's mind-boggling to think that just after she made this gem Katie Hepburn acquired her infamous sobriquet 'box-office poison' so quit Hollywood and persuaded Philip Barry to write a vehicle in which she could appear on Broadway (the result, 'The Philadelphia Story' was such a smash that MGM bought it and the film version was shown in a double bill with 'Baby' earlier today. In his first screen writing credit Hagar Wilde (who shared a writing credit with Dudley Nichols) hit one out of the park. The script follows the Rules of farce; an introductory scene, more or less 'straight' which makes as many plot points as possible followed by a rapidly spiralling series of off-the-wall incidents that have their own demented logic. The opening scene establishes David Huxley (Cary Grant) as a zoologist who's spent several months assembling a creature from the Jurassic Age who even as we watch receives news that the final piece, an intercostal clavicle, has been located and is in the post. We learn also that he is engaged to Alice Swallow (Virginia Walker) who we know he will never marry if only because Katie Hepburn is Grant's co-star, they will marry on the morrow but tight-haired eyeglass-wearing Walker makes it clear that there will be no conjugal relations and reminds Huxley that he is due to play golf with the lawyer of a possible benefactress who may very well donate a sorely needed million dollars to the museum. From here we can go either way and Grant did just that in North By North West which he began as an equally normal citizen but this time became embroiled in dramatic rather than screwball progressions.

Carlito's Way suffers from some of the same problems that Scarface did; but on the whole, this is a much more assured, far better made and just generally superior crime flick. As mentioned, Al Pacino takes the lead role and is on fine form as the recently released criminal Carlito Brigante with the desire to go straight. Unlike most criminals, Carlito has realised that a life of crime is only going to lead him to an early grave, and has therefore decided to get out before it gets that far. However, things aren't so simple and when his lawyer friend David Kleinfeld who got him out of jail needs Carlito's help to get a client of his out of the can, it isn't long before Carlito realises that walking away is more difficult than it appears.I've never subscribed to the idea that Al Pacino is one of the greatest actors ever. He's good, but he chooses roles that are too similar far too often. This film sees him in another familiar place, but this time he brings more to the table than usual. The way that he bleakly reminisces is brilliant and this brooding performance is definitely one of his best. Al Pacino is the star of this film, but wrestling him for every scene they share is Sean Penn, who's on fine form! Penn gives life to the sleazy lawyer brilliantly, and it's impossible to watch this film and not absolutely hate his guts. The acting isn't what makes Carlito's Way what it is, however; it's the plot and style that do that. De Palma is well known for 'borrowing' from other directors, and a lot of this film feels like it could have been taken from an old crime movie. De Palma was at the height of his confidence with this film, and that is always evident. The plot is brilliantly thought-out, and it isn't too far away from truly great character pieces, the likes of William Shakespeare. The ironic ending being of particular note.

What we have here is a film that more than delivers on the entertainment front, while still finding time for a backbone of thought-provoking substance. More often than not with movies that work from a premise, rather than an actual plot, they miss the mark because of a lack of ideas to populate the premise with; but that certainly isn't the case here! The film follows the story of Truman Burbank. Truman is an insurance salesman, but unlike most insurance salesmen; he has his own show. And unlike most people with their own show...he doesn't know about it. Truman Burbank is the unwitting star of the massively successful TV show; The Truman Show. His whole life has been the subject of this show and everything that he believes to be real is actually the brainchild of the show's creator, the flamboyant Christof. We then follow Truman as he goes about finding out that the real world, and his world, are different places entirely.As you might expect, this plot gives the film great basis for thought-provoking ideas. The idea itself of having a TV show filmed around your life is intriguing to say the least, and is more than enough to inspire paranoia from more than a few audience members. The idea is fused with the drama surrounding Truman's life, and the two blend brilliantly. Adding to this is the way that the film gives a commentary on the waive of reality TV shows. The substance is more than evident, as we are shown that Truman is a prisoner within his own life and the TV crew are, in effect, 'God'. The Truman Show features what is probably Jim Carey's best performance. The way that he amiably portrays the character makes the film a delight to watch. Carey was, of course, more known for his over the top (and very good) comedy roles before this film, but here he really shows his worth as an actor. The rest of the cast is mainly made up of lesser-known stars, with Ed Harris standing out and the rest helping to build the film into a great ensemble drama.

The Mel Brooks comments section where the film is replayed so that Mel can comment on it is not what it purports to be, since his comments are in general and not pertaining to the specific section of the film being played. In fact, most of the film is played in this section with no comments at all in the later scenes. This could have been handled just as well in an interview format and I suppose it was done this way to deliberately take up more space.The transfers and Dolby sound are fine but I wasn't impressed with the extras. I'd give the DVD itself a 5 or 6 only.The original film is something else. Certainly, it has to be one of the granddaddies of outrageous comedy and, as has been pointed out often enough in the comments, the film could not be made today. The N word especially would make it quite politically incorrect but the import of the film is not to put down the black; quite the opposite. And apparently Richard Pryor wrote most of these remarks.But I always thought the final scenes were rather a stretch with Mel not knowing how to end the film. Mel's putdown of gays in general may not be simple homophobia but it certainly seems to come close in this film.

Hitler's appearance in the commissary is probably a reference to the 40s actor, Robert Bobby Watson who played Hitler quite often in films of that time and even up to the early 60s. The character names are generally references to other characters or real persons such as Mel's Gov. William J.

The character names are generally references to other characters or real persons such as Mel's Gov. William J. LePetomaine who references a popular early 20th century French performer who could play tunes by turning around and breaking wind (No, I'm not making this up!). Carol Arthur (DeLuise) is Harriett Johnson who was a music critic for the New York Post, Gabby Johnson was George Gabby Hayes, a famous western sidekick of the 40s, and Boris the Hangman was Boris Karloff who played a similar part (Mord) in Tower of London (1939).Mel's Yiddish Indian, of course, is pure Mel and variations on this character seem to occur in many of his other films such as Yoda\/Yogurt in Spaceballs and Friar Tuck\/Rabbi Tuckman in Robin Hood Men in Tights. (Neither of these films is nearly as good as Blazing Saddles IMHO.) In short hilarious and a real classic, but don't expect any real discipline from Mel!

It tells the story about a Ranger (Nicholas Cage) who gets involved in a drunken fight concerning his wife, and he accidentally kills one of the men. He gets put in San Quentin, and stays there for a couple of years and then all of a sudden they decide that they have to escort some prisoners to another prison. They do so, by plane. On this plane there are some crazy villains and some not so crazy.. For example we have the bad guy Cyrus The Virus(John Malkovich), who i found to be extremely overexagurated. However Malkovich as usual gives us a top notch performance. Now most of the characters i found extremely clichéd. However there was one guy. One character they could actually make a whole movie about, but instead they throw him in late in this movie. Its Steve Buscemis character I'm talking about. He is so mystical and so weird but in a nice kind of a way, that you don't know whether to hate him or love him. he tells you gruesome stories like how he wore a girls head as a hat but in the end he becomes totally normal and ends up gambling in Las Vegas. Ah yes, the film ends in las Vegas.. Now here are some stupid things, they have to land the airplane somewhere in las Vegas and they cant make it to the airfield. So they have to land it on THE STRIP! i mean Come On! And during this attempt to land, Mr Poe(Nicholas Cage)'s friend called baby-O gets shot and is fatally wounded. So Poe gets started on a frenzy. He walks right up to the pilot and gets Shot in the arm on the way with out making the slightest move! However, they manage to land the plane strangely enough but Cyrus and his friends makes a run for it! So Poe starts chasing them.. Now Cyrus's death is one of the most stupidest death's i have ever seen.. First, he gets a pole right through his leg, then he gets smashed through some windows tied to a ladder, then he falls right through some electrical wires and THEN he land on some kind of a industrial machine that crushes things and he has the bad luck to get his head right under it. IN THE MIDDLE OF LAS VEGAS! A INDUSTRIAL MACHINE?! Now there's also Vince (John Cusack) who tries to help Mr Poe. He's kinda boring, but he gives the story somewhat of a lift.. And it really did need a lift.. Other than that, this is a nice little action flick. Yes it does contain stupid and unrealistic parts, but hey its action. The performances are great especially from Steve Buscemi who practically made this movie. If it was'nt for him, this movie would go way down. If you're looking for some nice action this is what you want. If you want some realistic thought provoking movie, this is not what you want.

But when people start turning up dead, it's obvious that this is no college prank.- For the most part, Hell Night is a standard 80s slasher.

I don't think this is much of a spoiler because most anyone could guess who is going to be left alive at the end of the movie. In fact, it's easy to predict with a fair amount of accuracy the order these people are going to die. The murders aren't extremely violent and some are left to the viewer's imagination. This was probably the result of budget constraints more than anything. The killers' make-up is bargain basement and not nearly as effective as some of the other movies of the period. Some of the acting is terrible and Vincent Van Patten is extremely annoying.- So, if the movie is predictable with poor special effects and acting, why haven't I rated Hell Night any lower? Other than those areas I've mentioned, the movie is reasonably well made. The house is fantastic and almost outshines any of the humans in the cast. Secret passages and long, dark corridors always make for fun in this kind of movie. Hell Night would have actually benefited had more emphasis been placed on the house. The movie is at worst competently directed by DeSimone. He does an above average job of creating atmosphere and creepy moments.

Without going into much detail I eventually left the environmental movement due to disillusionment and I have little good words to say about Quakers \/ pacifists and their dubious moral stance . When I learned about the plot of FRIENDLY PERSUSION which centres around a Quaker family who find themselves caught up in the American Civil War and having to find themselves choose between practical necessity and principal I just knew I'd have to see it . Here is a movie that personifies what great drama is all about where the protagonists have to make deep decisions and hopefully illustrates the hypocrisy of pacifism , but after seeing the movie I was aghast at its lack of drama and complexity. Worse still it lacks moral courage The opening scene is straight out of a Walt Disney production . Filmed in glorious and beautiful technicolor we see a young child little Jess Birdwell being attacked by a goose with entirely human mannerisms . The character interaction between goose and child is amusing and becomes something of a running theme in the movie . The story continues as the Birdwell family and their Quacker friends discuss the war and how they're going to stick to their self righteous principles and not take part in it and you just know that they'll have to discard their principles and take part by the end . Alas as the film continues I started to notice more and more wasted potential as to the drama What is the film trying to say ? Is it saying that war is wrong or is it saying pacifism is wrong ? . We see large portions of the running time dedicated to the pacifist characters self righteously saying they'll not take part in the conflict then the most self righteous critic Purdy takes up arms when is farm is burnt down by the Rebs . Is Purdy condemned as a hypocrite ? Possibly but it's understandable he wants revenge , what's not so understandable is why the elder Birdwell son Josh joins the Union home guard , especially since he's watched his parents condemn Purdy's actions . When Jess Birdwell Snr realises his son might be dead he picks up arms in a character arc that's not entirely convincing and it's here that the movie starts to fall down .Jess narrowly survives being killed by a Reb who he overpowers but eventually sets free . Wouldn't it have been more dramatic if he'd killed his prisoner ? And while he's away his homestead is visited by Confederate forces ! Oh no his wife and daughter will get gang raped before they're murdered with young Jess ! Actually they won't because these soldiers are very polite and appreciate Mrs Birdwell looking them dinner , they're so appreciative they even apologise for thinking of the family goose as lunch . And the movie ends with with the Birdwell family intact except for Josh who has his arm in a sling The problem with all this is that there's little involving the fundamental core of drama - Internal conflict . People easily pick up guns but their motives for doing so are not always convincing . When they come back from the war nothing as really changed from a dramatic viewpoint , they're still alive and everything they hold dear is still there . It might involve making changes to the original book but wouldn't it have been far more poignant if a couple of the Birdwell's had died thereby illustrating the cruelty of war along with the need to fight ? Director William Wyler and many of the contemporary audience of FRIENDLY PERSUSION had seen the first hand horrors of war , whilst here the movie points out that the enemy are not brutal and everyone goes home to their family after a conflict .

Well, no, but yes it is. All Final Fantasys have their own story, their own plot, their own unique touch. Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within had a more realistic and futuristic touch, which for some, became to much. I enjoyed the movie, although I did not get to see it before it was released on DVD. I had friends who had watched it, all told me the same thing; Its cool, but too short and I can't necessary go against them, right? No, I believe they where right, its a bit too short, too few details and in the end, all happens really quick, but it was a well written manuscript, cool idea that maybe a bit MORE Final Fantasy touch could have been even better. The Spirits Within marked my soul. See it, enjoy it and be sure to take a close look on the outstanding animations from one of the worlds leading designers.danrozen,swe ","genre":null},{"date":"28 August 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I have read lots of threads and comments about this film , and the majority I read (although not all in this forum though) seem to focus at the name; This is not a Final Fantasy movie.

It was annoying, unfunny, and the timing was completely moldy. Well, maybe Hawks learned from his mistakes because His Girl Friday was the direct opposite. While in Baby I thought that Grant and Hepburn made a horrific team whom couldn't play off each other, in this film Grant's chemistry with Rosalind Russell is impeccable. They both know timing and they both are able to keep up with each other. Both have their characters developed and understood so even if there was some ad lib mixed in with the script, we wouldn't know because they are able to playfully compete with each other on screen. The story is rather dark, surprisingly, which keeps the viewer attracted to the themes and plot, which unfolds with lightning speed in front of us. You have the sensation that Hawks felt comfortable with this film, the challenges and the actors unlike the outcome of Bringing Up Baby. Everyone involved seems to be on top of their game providing yet another memorable chapter in screwball comedy history.I must say that originally my impression of Cary Grant was not a desirable one. My first film viewed in which he stars did not leave a great taste in my mouth, but thankfully he was able to counter with this film. Grant seemed born to play Burns, and I wonder if it wasn't more comforting for him. He seemed relaxed in this role, familiar with his mannerisms, and completely in control. His ability to be constantly above 100% in each scene we watch was impressive, but what I found most enjoyable was Rosalind Russell's performance. She matched what Grant had and raised it even higher. You could not keep your eyes off her as she controlled every scene she was involved with. Her ability to be stronger than the male characters, and honestly smarter, was impressive for a film made in the 1940s. This was a strong woman doing a man's job, and I wouldn't be surprised if Hawks wasn't trying to tell us something here. While the ending of the film didn't seem to fit as well as the rest of the film with Russell, she was so charismatic, so charming, and so innocent, that you could not help but root for her during the entire run. She captured you and never let you go! While the characters did create this film and keep you laughing constantly, the story wasn't shabby either. It was actually a very dark story, darker than I anticipated a film starring Cary Grant would be. Here you have a newspaper conglomerate that has the power to sway the decisions of Governors, to take sides in public matters, to cohort with evildoers and still remain at the top of their game. While I do believe Hawks was trying to recreate the reality of such a fast paced work environment, I couldn't help but wonder if he wasn't speaking even on broader terms. Did he hold some animosity towards the media? Did Hawks think that perhaps the media was swaying the public's image away from the truth? One scene that I thought was sheer brilliance was when Molly Malloy (Helen Mack) arrived in the press room frantically yelling about how the newsmen smeared the truth throughout the paper. It was so bad that she herself couldn't remember what really happened. It seemed that every word that came from Molly's mouth was twisted into a new, far-fetched story. It was similar to a game of telephone. The truth may be staring you in the face, but when it reaches the end of the line, it may be something completely different. I think Hawks was trying to tell us something. Even when Molly finally reaches her climactic scene, you cannot help but wonder if she doesn't represent a part of Hawks, or the entertainment industry, or anyone hurt by the media. Inside this screwball comedy was something deeper and very disturbing.Overall, I was impressed with this film. I loved the language of the characters. I love the way that Cary Grant embodied this manipulative man who got everything he reached out for. Beware those thinking that this is a feminist film, while there may be a very strong central female character, the smarter Grant constantly undermines her. The ending was the only part of this film that I had trouble dealing with. While Hawks was trying desperately to drive a point home, it just seemed choppier than the rest of the film. The ending felt rushed and completely bland. I needed a stronger structure, but was extremely happy with the rest of the film. This was an amazing feature, for both the creative and charismatic characters that were painted onto the screen, but also with the hidden themes that Hawks threw in between jokes. I found myself laughing and thinking at the same time. This truly was one of those films that was released well before its time.Grade **** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"28 August 2005","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" A few weeks ago I reviewed one of Grant's earlier projects with director Howard Hawks called Bringing Up Baby and completely despised it.
