The first time I saw this pinnacle of Sturges' estimable career was at an aud call when I was in grammar school. The teachers herded us kids into the auditorium to watch a 16mm print of it and, they hoped, get us out of their hair for an hour and a half. I was only about 6 years old, but I believe Sullivan's Travels is the first film that ever made me cry tears of joy. It's been more than half a century, but my eyes still well up when I watch it, a sign that either the film is effective or I'm an easy mark. I prefer to believe it's the former.The plot tells of John L. Sully Sullivan, a Hollywood director who is a big success at turning out comedies, but then gets it into his head that he should direct a serious film with social significance, all about tragedy, hopelessness, and suffering. To prepare himself for this bleak scenario, he decides to go on the road dressed as a bum, with only ten cents in his pocket, to learn what it's like to be poor and hungry. Be careful what you wish for. Before Sullivan's travels come to an end, he will have visited the darkest corner of the deepest pit of the human condition.This being a Preston Sturges picture, of course there's a happy ending. But he puts the hero through hell before that happens. There's also a romance of sorts, pairing Sullivan (Joel McRea) with a young woman we know only as The Girl (Veronica Lake). I say of sorts because there is no love scene per se, no kissing, not even any fond hugging. The closest they ever get physically is one evening when the two ersatz hobos (The Girl has joined him in his masquerade) stop to admire the moon... and put their arms around each other, lightly. Less is more. I think the love between them seems stronger than if they were pawing each other every few minutes.Preston Sturges began his Hollywood career as a screenwriter (Never Say Die 1939, Remember the Night 1940), but soon prevailed on the studio brass to put him on as a director, because he was frustrated at the way directors were reshaping his words. His first film as both writer and director, The Great McGinty (1940), was a hit, and won him an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Sturges was on his way.There's an early scene in Sullivan's Travels that deftly shows off Sturges' skill with wordplay. McRea, Robert Warwick, and Porter Hall are having a vigorous debate over the wisdom of embarking on Sullivan's new, change-of-pace film. The rapid-fire dialogue is intoxicating to listen to, because it seems the actors never take a breath. As each line ends, a new one begins, as if we are watching a relay race with words instead of batons. That's not all The entire scene, from beginning to end, is shot in one continuous take, with no cuts. The camera moves as necessary, to follow the actors, but essentially it is all a single shot. And Sturges manages to bring the scene in at four minutes flat. I have no idea how he did it, or how many retakes were needed to achieve this precision. But the effect is mesmerizing.Sturges gives us many great scenes in Sullivan's Travels, but there is one that really put a lump in my throat. Sully has been imprisoned in a Deep South chain gang presided over by a ruthless warden (the great Alan Bridge). The warden won't brook Sully's independent attitude and resolves to crush his spirit by locking him in the sweat box, a sadistic, one-man windowless cell where the hapless prisoner is forced to stand for hours, alone.The prison trusty, played by Sturges regular Jimmy Conlin, visits the sweat box periodically and gives water to the dehydrated prisoner, and also gives him words of encouragement. Finally, at night, the trusty is allowed to open the sweat box and release Sullivan from this torture device. He unlocks the door, and the exhausted Sullivan collapses into his arms. The camera remains still for several seconds while the trusty cradles him gently. I don't know if Sturges intended this, but the shot reminded me of a Renaissance painting of St. John holding the body of Christ after the Crucifixion.Sullivan's personal epiphany comes when he joins the other prisoners as guests at a local black church, where they are treated to an evening of Mickey Mouse cartoons. The prisoners, the warden, even the preacher, laugh uproariously at the antics of Mickey and his dog Pluto. Finally, Sullivan starts to laugh, too. And that's when this great comedy director realizes the truth the best gift he can offer his audiences is not dour drama, but comedy -- pictures that enrich the human condition by offering a touch of happiness in a world too filled with tragedy.McRea's final line in the movie is one of the greatest closers ever. After Sullivan's eventual escape and reunion with his Hollywood friends, he announces that he won't be making that socially significant picture after all. He'll stick to making comedies. Why? There's a lot to be said for making people laugh. Do you know that's all some people have? It's not a lot, in this cockeyed caravan, but it's better than nothing.

It's quite extraordinary how this is played out. It's quite amazing to see how Conrad keeps everything bottled up throughout most of the movie yet shows so much more under the surface even during these times than the most verbose speeches could have rendered. The thought that came to me about his attempted suicide after his brother Buck's drowning was that it wasn't just guilt that drove him to that but I believe he may have sensed that his mother wasn't willing to love him (her only surviving child) even after that so he may have done it as a last ditch attempt to win her love by doing what he believed she may have preferred all along. Timothy Hutton definitely earned his Oscar here and it was good of him to dedicate it to his late father Jim who became terminally ill with liver cancer during the film's shooting.Mary Tyler Moore played Beth as far more complex and with more depth than she might have been played by a lesser actress. Even though Beth is quite hypocritical- saying and doing many selfish and heartless actions, there IS a humanity in her character so that even when she leaves without so much as mustering a goodbye to her still-fragile son, one can sense that she WILL be missed by both her husband and son even though both have had to come to conclusion that she never genuinely loved either of them. Her scenes with her parents, brother, neighbors and trick-or-treaters showed she WAS capable of having genuine affection for others but NOT for the most important people in her life. Perhaps, Beth feared getting too close to those who knew HER faults all too well. One must ask though, how could Conrad have known that his mother had had to uproot and replace the bathroom sink and tile work because the blood from his suicide attempt proved indelible unless he overheard her or she outrightly TOLD him so?! And then,too, the scene at the golf course when Beth berates Calvin for having the temerity to wonder if the suicidal Conrad was okay and wanting to phone him after so many days alone (accusing Conrad of somehow manipulating his father's emotions for HIS sake ) was quite outrageous as was her chastising Calvin for tactfully imparting the news about Conrad's current therapy to a concerned neighbor saying that Conrad's problems had to stay within the family- yet having two VERY public outbursts about Conrad in front of total strangers! The scenes in which she was discomfited by Conrad's walking into Buck's room as though he had deliberately disturbed her worshiping at her personal shrine and when she utterly recoiled when Conrad hugged her and told her how happy he was to see her were quite chilling indeed. It would have been easy for Beth to been played as an utterly heartless, vindictive witch but, even during Beth's worst, Moore showed us Beth's humanity! It should be noted that Moore now admits that her relationship with her only child Ritchie Meeker was somewhat strained during his teen years. However; they DID reconcile and became close by the time she made this movie and he lived to be her escort for the premiere. The movie must have been quite cathartic for BOTH to see. However; Moore's comfort would prove tragically short-lived as Meeker would die from an accidental shooting at age 24 a few months after this premiered! The late Donald Sutherland as Calvin was perhaps the most compelling of the main roles as he alone earnestly wanted everything to be alright for all members of his family to the degree that he refused to see Beth's flaws until almost too late. Sutherland made him quite believable without having Calvin become 'touchy feeling and overly sensitive'. It should also be noted here that Dinah Manoff shined in her solitary scene as the one-time fellow patient Karen whose suicide would prompt Conrad to desperately seek out help to save himself from his own demons. Karen also faked being cured and happy but the viewer couldn't be fooled by this bravado thanks to Manoff's intensity! It's too bad Manoff has since opted for comedy instead of revisiting her dramatic heights. This isn't a 'chick flick' but one of humanity in all its best and worst.

It is beautifully photographed. The special effects were for its time revolutionary. And there is a truly fascinating story there to be told. Unfortunately it is in the storytelling that 2001 suffers. The film raises many questions, then spends over two hours not answering them. For much too much of that time absolutely nothing happens. But you stay with it because there seems to be the possibility of a great payoff at the end. Yet the ending frustrates just as much as all that came before it, perhaps more so. You may well find yourself saying I waited two hours for THAT? And what the heck was that anyway? I do not believe a movie has to lay all the answers out for you. Some of the best films of all time are very much left open to your own interpretation. But the answers we are given here are so unsatisfying and ultimately confusing that we wonder why we went through the trouble of watching at all.Again this movie does have a lot going for it and it is easy to see why so many praise it. It certainly seems to be one of the most polarizing films of all time. Love it or hate it, there is no in between. While I would not recommend it I must say the movie sets up a fascinating premise. The opening sequence which takes place in prehistoric times goes on a tad too long but is rich with symbolism and intrigue and sets up well the themes of the movie. Many are fascinated by the evolution of man, the questions Why are we here?, How did we get here, and What exactly is it all about? In this film, man sets off on a quest for answers to these questions. Unfortunately the answers don't satisfy. If it is answers you seek perhaps you should see the sequel 2010 which if nothing else sheds some light on what in the world the last twenty minutes or so of 2001 was all about. If you want to see the true genius of Kubrick then Dr. Strangelove or A Clockwork Orange will do quite nicely. Enjoy what is good about 2001....the beautiful photography, the special effects, the great and fascinating character of the computer HAL. But be forewarned that this long journey does not lead to a satisfying destination.

But the answers we are given here are so unsatisfying and ultimately confusing that we wonder why we went through the trouble of watching at all.Again this movie does have a lot going for it and it is easy to see why so many praise it. It certainly seems to be one of the most polarizing films of all time. Love it or hate it, there is no in between. While I would not recommend it I must say the movie sets up a fascinating premise. The opening sequence which takes place in prehistoric times goes on a tad too long but is rich with symbolism and intrigue and sets up well the themes of the movie. Many are fascinated by the evolution of man, the questions Why are we here?, How did we get here, and What exactly is it all about? In this film, man sets off on a quest for answers to these questions. Unfortunately the answers don't satisfy. If it is answers you seek perhaps you should see the sequel 2010 which if nothing else sheds some light on what in the world the last twenty minutes or so of 2001 was all about. If you want to see the true genius of Kubrick then Dr. Strangelove or A Clockwork Orange will do quite nicely.

It is beautifully photographed. The special effects were for its time revolutionary. And there is a truly fascinating story there to be told. Unfortunately it is in the storytelling that 2001 suffers. The film raises many questions, then spends over two hours not answering them. For much too much of that time absolutely nothing happens. But you stay with it because there seems to be the possibility of a great payoff at the end. Yet the ending frustrates just as much as all that came before it, perhaps more so.

He's damn gorgeous first and foremost, and his first very dark moment is superbly acted!!! Bad acting, overacting, bah!!! Whoever says this stuff doesn't know what they're talking about, either that or the actor they were voting for didn't get this iconic role. Either way, Anakin's anguish and rage and hate are evident when he murders the Sand-People and then when he confesses everything to Padme. They're animals and I slaughtered them like animals!!! I hate them!!! God, what do people want???!!! I was fully aware of the quick, easy path of the Dark Side when I saw this!!! Hayden Christensen IS Anakin Skywalker, and his performance is one of the high points of this less than perfect installment of Star Wars.The other great things??? There really are quite a few. The love story is convincing. Maybe people will always remember Han and Leia as having the most memorable love story, but Anakin is not a cocky anti-hero and Padme is not a smart-alecky orphaned princess. Every character, new and old, has their own personality. What did people want??? A lot of groping and smooching??? I wasn't all that offended by some of the hokey love lines between the two. They teased each other, talked a lot about their roles in life, and eventually fell in love. There was probably a lot of love there even when Anakin was only 9 and Padme was but 14. Anyway, the romance element was just fine. I believed the two loved each other, so the purpose was served.Big faults Way too much CGI. The chase of the changeling on Coruscant was good. The attempted executions using clawed and fanged beasts wasn't too bad, but so many cartoon characters!!! The slobby friend of Obi-Wan's who worked in a diner. The Kaminoans. The Genesoans. The droids that fought the Jedi and the clones. Heavens to betsy, there is such a thing as overkill. Luckily, the CGI didn't overwhelm the story as badly as it could have. The pacing is more confusing than PHANTOM MENACE I should also point out. The end was confusing. And maybe that was intentional...are the clones really to help the Jedi and the Republic, or were they made especially for the Separatist movement and the Sith??? While AOTC is not the best of the new STAR WARS trilogy (I think REVENGE OF THE SITH will definitely take that title) the harsh criticism it has gotten isn't deserved.I DO think ATTACK OF THE CLONES wasn't a good title.

But when I'm able to see a movie that deals with the life of the ordinary man in that time period, than I'm always willing to give it a chance.Germinal is such a movie that deals with life of the ordinary man and woman. It tells the story of the coal miners in the region of Lille, in the North of France at the end of the 19th century. They are all poor, they work too hard in awful conditions and they don't get paid what they deserve by the bosses who only want to get richer and richer by doing whatever they can so they won't have to pay a cent to their workforce. Of course the miners aren't happy with that situation and when they get into contact with two men who both want to change the situation, one a communist union man and the other one an anarchist, the miners soon go on a strike, with some very unpleasant consequences as a result...What first went through my mind while seeing this one, was that this movie has a lot of similarities with Daens (1993), the Belgian movie that tells the story of the poor textile workers in Flanders at the end of the 19th century. It's the same time period and both regions are only about 60 miles or 90 kilometers apart. If you like to see what life in the European industrial regions at the end of the 19th century was like, than both movies are certainly something you shouldn't miss.What I liked about the movie as well was that it had a good pace and that it stayed interesting from the beginning until the end. It could have been very easy for the director to make a movie about this subject that lasted 5 or 6 hours, but than it might have lost much of its power. Now, you get a pretty good idea of what life in that region during the industrial revolution was like, without having to struggle through too many details that don't really contribute to the story. Next to the good story, I must say that I also liked the acting. Even though Gérard Depardieu hasn't always made the best choices of movies to play in, I always like him in the role of the ordinary man, the underdog that has to fight the system. I liked him in the mini-series Les Misérables as well and he has the same kind of role in this movie. The other actors did a fine job as well, even though I have to admit that I don't really know anyone of them, except for Bernard Fresson perhaps.

DANCES WITH WOLVES won best picture in 1990, two years later the prize was claimed by the film UNFORGIVEN. Two versions of the Tombstone legend were produced at about the same time, TOMBSTONE (1993) and Wyatt Earp (1994), which varied greatly in tone and success. The trend was towards a revised, and, for the most part, more honest form of storytelling. UNFORGIVEN, Clint Eastwood's bleak masterpiece, attempted to dispel the stereotypes of the old west and bring to the screen a gritty and realistic portrait of violent people during hard times. This was not a new idea by any means (see Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH), but it was especially pointed coming from Eastwood who, thirty some odd years earlier, became an icon as the ambiguous central character in Sergio Leone's DOLLARS trilogy. It is the style of Leone's spaghetti western that Sam Raimi seems to take as inspiration for his 1995 film THE QUICK AND THE DEAD. Raimi, at this point, had developed his own style of film making (THE EVIL DEAD films, DARKMAN) and the resulting integration of Leone's ideals results in some of the most satisfying moments in THE QUICK AND THE DEAD. It is also a film that embraces the western clichés, becoming more of a homage to previous cinematic renderings of the time period, which it relies on heavily. This is evident during the opening credits sequence where we see images of the prototypical western (buried gold, dusty landscapes, a graveyard) which sets the tone. Into the town of Redemption rides The Lady (Sharon Stone), who, drawn by revenge, enters the quick-draw competition that is held by the resident warlord named John Herod (Gene Hackman). The contest (and the prize money attached) draws a colorful array of supporting characters Ace Hanlon (Lance Henriksen), Scars (Mark Boone Junior), Spotted Horse (Jonothan Gill); a hired gun named Clay Cantrell (Keith David); Dog Kelly (Tobin Bell), who has his own score to settle, and The Kid (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is a local with strong ties to the town. Herod has also brought Cort (Russell Crowe), a former member of Herod's gang turned preacher, to the event as an unwilling participant. What follows is a protracted series of gunfights, most timed to the strike of a giant clock which serves as a passing bell for the fallen contestants. Theses scenes represent the more entertaining elements of THE QUICK AND THE DEAD swirling extreme camera angles, fast wide-angle pullbacks, bullet P.O.V. setups; at one point the camera looks straight through a hole in a character's head. The best and, oddly, the earliest major showdown, which occurs between Herod and Ace Hanlon, is the high point of the film. After the final revelation, and ensuing (illogical) climax, the viewer is, however, left with a slick package but very little content.There are moments of development Observe the scene where, after his daughter has been raped by one of the duelists (Kevin Conway), the barkeep (Pat Hingle) reaches for the man's gun, hesitates, then goes about his business; or the way Herod's hand shakes before one of the gunfights. But in a word, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD is about style. Raimi's vision for the film is helped considerably by several contributors The cinematography, by Dante Spinotti, captures the dust, rain and the setting sun perfectly. Spinotti also remains flexible, adding his own mark to many of Raimi's outrageous techniques. Alan Silvestri, taking his cue from Ennio Morricone, fashions a score replete with whip cracks, trumpets and flamenco guitar. His work during the gunfight montage is particularly noteworthy. Pietro Scalia's editing (which must have been laborious considering the amount of cuts) and Patrizia von Brandenstein's production design add another level of depth to the story.Gene Hackman can play a character like Herod in his sleep by now, and the film relies on Hackman's persona to backstop a character with limited screen time. He is one of the few actors that can handle a line like ...you better scuttle your butt out of town... and retain a level of humor and menace. As Cort, Russell Crowe (in a very early American film role) also goes a long way with his conflicted preacher in a short period of time. The weakest link is Sharon Stone. Her character is wildly uneven; tough as nails one second, the next, weeping like a child. In all fairness the writing does not help the situation, placing, as it does, almost all of the film's emotional conflict on Stone's shoulders. It would be a hard part to play for anyone, but her performance is disjointed and she delivers many of her scenes far to straight (gender lines aside, an actor like Hackman would have internalized some of the melodrama). The supporting cast, filled in by many wonderful character actors, end up being nothing more than colorful cardboard targets. On a whole, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD does not live up to its lofty influences, but if the you chose to gloss over the film's weaker points, it is an mildly entertaining production in the mold of the western matinée. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 May 2005","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" During the early 90's, the western genre saw something of a revival.

It sort of feels right. In patience if not true time, this is one of the longest movies I ever sat through.Robert Redford is Jeremiah, a Mexican War veteran who has clearly had enough of civilization and wants to strike out for land where no white man has been. In the course of his travels, he meets a colorful grizzly-bear hunter (Will Geer), a scalp trader (Stefan Gierasch), a Flathead woman (Delle Bolton) and a boy (Josh Albee). None really are around very long, as Jeremiah's loneliness and individualism is pretty much the theme of the picture.A film that feels very much of its time, with a folksy singer playing a guitar while a camera pans over miles of snow-covered mountains, Jeremiah Johnson has a rugged authenticity that commands respect, without ever spilling over into Granola-hippie platitudes. With John Milius co-writing the screenplay, there's no chance the film will stoop at the conventional political pieties of its day (or ours). Indians massacre whites, whites shoot animals for fur, a sign over the door of a trading post says White men only, and no one questions why.But the problem with the film is that it is a trial to watch through its slow but meritable first half, then loses its bearings to become a different, quicker, but dumber movie, a revenge story with the once-peaceable Jeremiah becoming Crow-killer. I understood the transformation, but it feels somehow wrong, with a series of sudden battles between JJ and individual Crow warriors (Lucky they were Crow. Apache would have sent 50 at once, the scalp trader tells him) and a final scene so abrupt it appears the producers ran out of money.It's a one-man film, and Redford shows he can be interesting company. I'm not totally sold on his frontier authenticity, I know in real life the man is a big fan of the Great Outdoors, but he looks like Barry Gibb in buckskin with his big old beard. Still, he inhabits the small scenes well, like the one where he lights a fire or tries to teach his new Indian bride to say Yes or tries to take his legacy from the cold, dead hands of Hatchet Jack.At times a good film, at times a dull one, Jeremiah Johnson showcases the spirit of western migration. Actually, one of the things Westerners would say was the toughest thing to face was not the hard winters or Indian attacks, but the boredom. Maybe Jeremiah is too authentic that way.

I'm not totally sold on his frontier authenticity, I know in real life the man is a big fan of the Great Outdoors, but he looks like Barry Gibb in buckskin with his big old beard. Still, he inhabits the small scenes well, like the one where he lights a fire or tries to teach his new Indian bride to say Yes or tries to take his legacy from the cold, dead hands of Hatchet Jack.At times a good film, at times a dull one, Jeremiah Johnson showcases the spirit of western migration. Actually, one of the things Westerners would say was the toughest thing to face was not the hard winters or Indian attacks, but the boredom. Maybe Jeremiah is too authentic that way.

Great script written by Richard Matheson, who later went on to do much good work for The Twilight Zone and even today is still producing scripts for such films as Stir of Echoes and What Dreams May Come. The story is fairly simple- after passing through a mysterious cloud on the ocean, our hero Scott (Grant Williams) discovers that his clothes seem to start feeling looser. More time passes and he discovers that he is now shorter than his wife. Day after day, he becomes smaller and smaller until he becomes so small that an ordinary housecat becomes a terrifying threat to his very life. The special effects might seem unconvincing to modern eyes... but the otherwise high-quality of the editing and direction make the action scenes as effective and suspenseful as anything you likely to see spewed out by today's CGI factories. I was totally unprepared for the ending of this film... you'd never see a movie end this way nowadays... but you never too many of them end this way back in the '50s either! A classic!

But it is thematically a mess, and on that count is wildly overrated.The complaints about this movie on these IMDb comments are two one that it is properly speaking an anti-war film, and the other that it indulges in crude nationalism. Both complaints are on the mark, but it should be noticed that they are not quite consistent with one another. Saving Private Ryan, in the tradition of Vietnam movies like Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, focuses on the human cost of war. But its moral, that we must earn the sacrifice those bold men made for us so long ago, sits rather uncomfortably with the focus on the cost. After all, how could we earn the loss of these men and the grief of their mothers? By living well? By being good people? It doesn't make sense. How could you make your life worth the sacrifice of so many others?Perhaps the point is that we ought to be grateful to the men who fought and died for saving our lives. But this doesn't make sense either. The war in Europe did not properly speaking save our lives. Wars are rarely if ever fought to save lives. They are fought to conquer and to defend against being conquered. But being conquered does not amount to being killed, and it might well save lives to surrender. Spielberg does obliquely refer to the Holocaust in the film. But he must know as everyone does that the war was not fought to end the Holocaust.Perhaps Spielberg is tacitly assuming some flag-waving boilerplate about how they fought 'for freedom', and we ought to be grateful for that. I don't deny that 'saving Europe for liberal democracy'&#151;however we understand that--was a noble cause. But it would be impossible to tell from this movie that this was the point of the war, and it might well be impossible to believe that such a cause was worth dying for once you had properly taken in its message that war is the senseless destruction of mothers' sons.War movies traditionally fall into two types. One type focuses on the heroic cause the soldiers fought for, in which case you will want to glorify war. You will want to make your soldiers look strong, noble, and make our hearts melt with admiration for them. Otherwise how can we encourage others to fight for such (often abstract) causes? Most classic WWII movies fit this mold. And given that most of us think WWII was fought for a good cause, this makes sense. The other alternative is to focus on the human cost of war, as Vietnam movies and WWI movies typically do. But it isn't a coincidence that Vietnam and WWI are thought to be pointless wars. The idea of such movies is that nationalism and social habits can lead us to sacrifice our children for nothing. By shocking us with the horror of war, we are encouraged to mistrust martial impulses. Saving Private Ryan tries to take from both traditions, and ends up with a garbled mess. WWII was a noble cause that could not have been worth the sacrifice. It might be argued that each type of movie neglects some important truth that the other type captures. Perhaps some great filmmaker will successfully ennoble the causes of war and at the same time capture its horror. Perhaps someone already has. All I know is that Spielberg has not.
