Lieutenant Michael Harrigan (Danny Glover) & his team, Danny Archuleta (Ruben Blades), Leona Cantrell (Maria Conchita Alonso) & new boy Jerry Lambert (Bill Paxton) are on the front line fighting against the terror these gangs bring to the streets. However there seems to be a new player in town, a new kind of killer loose, a killer without mercy, without motive, without discrimination & one who loves to kill. Harrigan & his team have nothing to go on except a spear head made from a material that is unknown on Earth & the sudden appearance of shadowy FBI figure Peter Keyes (Gary Busey) & his team of men who seem very interested in capturing whoever or whatever is responsible for these brutal killings. It's not long before Harrigan realises that what he is up against is not of this planet, it's the ultimate killing machine, it's the ultimate predator...Directed by Stephen Hopkins I thought Predator 2 was a good solid sci-fi\/horror\/action film but was not as good as the original Predator (1987) which had the perfect blend of blood, guts, big guns, testosterone, one-liners, action & explosions. I cannot say the same for Predator 2, unfortunately. The script by Jim & John Thomas shifts the action from the jungles of Central America to the urban jungle of Los Angeles which is my first problem, I just thought that the hunter\/prey situation worked so much better in the isolated harsh jungle than the sprawling city of Los Angeles. Danny Glover is no Arnold Schwarzenegger in the running around with a big gun blowing things up stakes & they just had to include the clichéd misguided scientist who wants to capture the predator so we can study it. Also, if these FEDS were so clever why did they leave the only piece of information that could lead Harrigan to them & the predator on the computer for that pathologist to find & yet manage to completely delete everything else? Having said that Predator 2 is a good film, it moves along at a nice pace, has one or two decent action scenes & provides solid entertainment.Director Hopkins could have done a better job, for a start just having people randomly fire guns at nothing in particular is neither exciting or original & I actually thought the action scenes lacked a certain spark & seemed a little dull even down to an almost incomprehensible train sequence in which you can barely tell what's happening because it's set amidst flickering lights. Danny Glover looked a bit old & out of shape as well as he tries to do a Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon (1987), wasn't Glover purposely the old slow one in the Lethal Weapon films? Apparently Predator 2 was cut down to get a lower rating so don't expect buckets of blood or gore, there are some skinned bodies, a decapitated head, someone is cut with a razor wire net, people are impaled on spears & there are plenty of gunshot wounds but there's nothing here overly nasty.Technically Predator 2 is great & has that big budget Hollwood polish to it, the special effects hold up well even today & the predator creature is just plain cool, isn't it? A lot of the original's music is reused here which also seemed out of place & inappropriate at times. Predator 2 has a fine cast which it wastes, Paxton is always watchable, Robert Davi is criminally underused although Conchita Alonso annoyed me with her hairstyle & irritating accent.Predator 2 is a good film of that there is no doubt but I much prefer the original, it's as simple & straight forward as that. Definitely worth a watch though as I think most would enjoy it.

Answer The Sweetest Thing &#150; the most entertaining dud I've had the pleasure to witness in recent years.On one hand, watching the Sweetest Thing is like driving past a multiple car pile-up (with fatalities) &#150; it's really, really bad but you can't help but watch; on the other hand, it plays like a dream come true (for me, at least!) &#150; Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate and Selma Blair starring in a lewd comedy that continually entertains in the most unexpected and bizarre manner. How this movie got green-lighted I will never know, but I am glad it did!!Experienced man-eaters Christina (Diaz) and Courtney (Applegate) decide to help friend Jane (Blair) over her relationship-induced depression by taking her out on the town. Whilst in a nightclub, Christina meets Peter, who could just be the man of her dreams, but she opts out of going to a party with him, and later regrets her decision. Courtney talks her into pursuing him (to his brother's wedding) and what ensues is a zany road trip packed with slapstick and locker room humour.With the confident, sexually-in-control lead characters (played by Diaz and Applegate), Director Roger Kumble must have been aiming for a Sex in the City style girl-power comedy, but this isn't exactly what he delivers. The end result is a combination of crude hit-and-miss American Pie style humour, hot women, and jaw-droppingly out-of-place scenes that is just as likely to appeal to men as to women.Christina Applegate has been a favourite of mine since Married With Children and Cameron Diaz is also high on my top-Hollywood-totty list, so the two of them together are a real treat. Frequently appearing in skimpy outfits (or just their underwear!), I couldn't fail to enjoy this movie. But, for me, just as entertaining are the regular cringe-inducing moments which make you wonder why the actresses signed on the dotted line to make this film in the first place. So stupefyingly wretched are some of these, that you feel bad for watching; its the cinematic equivalent of visiting a freak-show at a carnival.So-bad-that-they-are-good highlights include the penis in the eye, Blair's blow-job that goes wrong, the movie montage, and (in the Unrated version) the incredible Penis song&#151;un-freakin'-believable! So if you're after a classy romance or a date comedy, forget it...

Me, too, things like Shut up, already! and Look behind the tombstone, you silly Nazis!I guess when it comes to The Sound Of Music, you either have it, or you've had it. Count me in the latter camp. Oh, the film starts out strong, on one of the biggest shots in movies, and it has some beautiful camera work to go along with some nice if somewhat simplistic songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein. But if Julie Andrews' other best-known musical, from 1964, involved a spoonful of sugar, this 1965 release feels more like a truckful of treacle, especially in the second half when the story gets ropier, the songs dodgier, and the acting too staged by half.Except for her singing where she shines, Andrews gives a distressingly one-note performance as a postulant nun, Maria, sent on sabbatical to look after the seven rambunctious children of a stern naval captain in Salzburg, Austria. In time, a remarkably condensed time, she has converted the children into a happy singing group and Captain von Trapp into a sappy velveteen Romeo. But will they find freedom as one big happy family, or else be crushed by the Nazi jackboot?I guess that's supposed to be the drama in this piece, but it's pushed together so haphazardly and drawn out so over the course of three hours that it never feels the least real, with or without the fruity singing. Maria sings about bluebirds and sleigh bells and whiskers on kittens, the kids perform ornate puppet shows and sing their way to bed before a party of admiring guests, and even Capt. von Trapp joins in, singing Edelweiss to an audience of Nazis so solemnly he puts them all to sleep so his family can escape.Even Ernest Lehman, who wrote the screenplays for North By Northwest and Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?, pushes the trite meter past 11. The boys and girls all cry in unison when Maria guilts them over a frog trick or hide under her covers when thunder cracks overhead. I guess Lehman figured with a score that has them singing So long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, goodnight...I flit\/I float\/I fleetly flee and flyyyy... these kids were on something stronger than schnitzel and noodles. The poor captain might have noticed this, except he's played by Christopher Plummer in such a tight-mouthed fog much of the time, you wonder if he's not hitting that wine cellar of his a bit too much.There are good numbers, namely the opening one with Andrews performing the title song on a mountain top in a nicely low-key hands-in-pockets way, and the best song in the score which follows that, How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria? well-staged in an abbey courtyard as a dialogue amongst several nuns. One, Sister Sophia, brings an Audrey Hepburn-like quality to her singing. With director Robert Wise's steady hand and cinematographer Ted McCord's nice attention to the stained-glass and groined-ceiling decor, the sequence really sticks with you and is enjoyable to see over again.But Wise makes some odd decisions with other numbers that follow, especially the icky Edelweiss and 16 Going On 17, a nice song undone by campy staging. Climb Ev'ry Mountain, a showstopper on stage, is performed by the Mother Abbess with a terribly trilly overdub and in such dark shadow you'd think she was a mob informant for the FBI. Actually, Wise says in his director's commentary that he was put off by the bombastic way he felt the song came off on stage, but his solution only makes things worse.Finally, the movie needed to end with the wedding, which while saccharine, is at least a pretty high note in keeping with what came before. The Nazi chase that follows is just silly, an attempt to add some movie drama that comes off as sour bubble gum.Two things to say in this movie's favor. One is lots and lots of people don't agree with me and have made The Sound Of Music a cultural touchstone. The other is the 40th anniversary of the film's release came with a DVD that is a very nice and generous package, chockful of generous add-ons like candid commentaries from Andrews and Wise, a delightful reminiscence by the now-grown actors who played the kids, and even a karaoke feature for those deluded souls who not only enjoy the movie, but sing along to it. If you like the movie, even a little, you probably owe it to yourself to get this DVD.

However, despite all the negative comments about this film, I found it very enjoyable. For an action film it actually has a plot. Granted, it's not the most detailed of plots, it's pretty simple but that's what makes it good - you can just take it on face value, accept 2 + 2 = 4 and there we go.Kurt Russell did a really good job in his part, not showing emotion for the majority of the film but when he does it is moving because we have seen how he has been trained and what he has been through. Jason Isaacs is good as Mekum, the bad guy of the film. I bought this film after discovering he was in it and reading a bit about it. It was also going cheap. One thing I would say, Isaacs doesn't have his Harry Potter \/ The Patriot voice here, the voice people may see as familiar to him, but he is menacing when he has to be and is a very good actor. Steadily becoming on of my favourites.I have noticed there has been some dubiety as to the alignment of Gary Busey and his two side-kicks. The simple answer is they are neutral. Church (Busey) wants to stick with the veterans like Todd (Russell) rather than Mekum's (Isaacs) genetically modified soldiers. However, if the new soldiers prove to be more efficient in combat then Busey will be happy to use them. He neither causes any problems for the good guys or causes any problems for the bad guys in an unequal measurement. He's a bastard to both and a nice guy to both.To conclude, Soldier is a very good film with a good balance of story and action. Sci-fi \/ action fans will enjoy this film if I'm going to generalise. I'm not a sci-fi \/ action fan, I'll watch most things, and I thought this was great.

One can argue that this is not Hitchcock at work but the work of the writers&#151;playwright Patrick Hamilton, actor turned novice screenplay writer Hume Cronyn and of course Ben Hecht. As I have not read the original play, I cannot guess how much was Hitchcock's contribution to the morbidity and various dark undercurrents, which included the aura of homosexuality. Equally inexplicable is the relationship between James Stewart's character and the housemaid.A good play is a boon for actors&#151;they often get great lines to speak. Stewart et al. appear to give superb performances. But then Burtons gave an outstanding performance in Albee's Who is afraid of Virginia Woolf? and Olivier and Caine captivated us in Schaffer's Sleuth.If we leave the script behind and assess the cinema the film offers considerable touches of innovation. For me, the finest scene in the film is when Jimmy Stewart is handed the hat of the missing\/dead invitee as he prepares to leave the apartment. The innovative method employed by Hitchcock for changing scenes by obstructing the camera view with the back of various characters is captivating. Hitchcock loved to involve food and drinks in his films&#151;but serving food on a box containing a dead person was incredibly morbid. Hitchcock also uses his technique of capturing conversations silently the conversation of Stewart and the housekeeper slowly becomes silent for the viewer even when they are talking. Hitchcock did this trick in the court scenes of Notorious and Frenzy and the flower shop scene in Topaz. He loved to repeat his own tricks, film after film.There is humor in this film. The banter about movies where the names of the films are forgotten and replaced by the word Something includes indirect reference to Notorious without mentioning the name but mentioning the names of the stars and the number of words in the title.Structurally the film is a delight for students of cinema.

In the film, Hitchcock dispenses with the sexual distraction to go directly to the killing. The killing of Juanita captured by the overhead camera, shows the purple gown spreading in the floor as blood would have spread. No blood is shown&#151;only the gown.

The lunch sequence (a typical Hitchcock food event) may look simple but the montage of shots capturing Noiret's apparent interest in the food than the conversation is truly engaging. Noiret is a fine actor. So is Michel Piccoli. The two of them outshine Frederick Stafford and John Forsythe.The third most fascinating shot is post-torture interrogation of Mrs Mendoza&#151;the whispered response from a posture that reminds one of Michelangelo's Pieta&#151;with her dead husband replacing the dead Christ.Hitchcock's perseverance with marriage continues.
