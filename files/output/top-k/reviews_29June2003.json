I read a recent article that called Batman one of the best superhero movies ever.  What is wrong with some people?In my opinion, this movie ushered in an era of movies with all style and no substance.  Tim Burton is an awful, overrated director that should be forbidden from making another superhero film without strict supervision from the producers.  Anyone notice how he also screwed up Planet of the Apes?  How did he get a rep as a good director???Where do I start with the flaws of Batman?  How about top billing going to Jack Nicholson\/The Joker?  Hello!!! This is a movie about BATMAN!!!Yet the Joker was in the forefront of this movie.  No attention was paid to how Bruce Wayne trained his mind and body to become the Dark Knight detective.  As shown in this movie, all it takes is some money to develop a few cool weapons and an armored suit to become Batman.  Anyone could do it.The movie actually bored me.  Batman's appearances were so few and far between that I remember nearly falling asleep in the theater.  Michael Keaton gave a decent performance as Bruce Wayne, but was still miscast.To prove that his horrid direction was no fluke, Burton followed up with the even more horrendous sequel, Batman Returns.  For great comic book adaptations, check out Spider-Man, Superman, X-Men, X-2, Blade, and yes, even Daredevil.  The Hulk is also much better than this drivel.  Hopefully, Warner Brothers will start the Bat-saga from scratch and give us the real take on the character.  Just don't let Burton near the set.

Each person has a skill needed to escape from the mysterious cube, which is filled with booby-trapped rooms.  So I give the film some credit for simply attempting to create such a neat idea.And I thought that the filmmakers created the cube itself quite nicely, especially as they were on a low budget.  Even though the film is almost entirely confined inside rather smallish, cube-like rooms, I really didn't get tired of looking at the same set again and again.  Another commendation I can give to the film is that I truely did feel the suspense, the sense of paranoia, etc.  At least I was entertained.But the movie is deeply flawed.  First off, the acting is poor. Considering that the only thing to look at for 95% of this movie is the acting, I'd say this is a serious problem.  Not to say the actors had tons to work with, since the script itself wasn't so good.  The whole mathematical premise that the cube is based upon is rather shaky -- if it actually DOES make sense, then it is explained very poorly and clunkily.  And the ending was a big let-down.  Terribly disappointing, and it really didn't make so much sense.Also, I went into watching Cube thinking there would be some kind of dawning and horrible realization as to what the cube's really was.  This is never adequately explained in the movie.  Rather than focusing on the nature of the cube itself, the film centers almost entirely on the breakdown of the characters inside the cube, with some nifty traps going off and killing or hurting people in neat ways every so ofter.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing -- it's just not what I expected.  And it's also kind of tough to pull off without really bang-up acting, which I reiterate, this film did NOT have.Cube is some fun, but a let-down.  If the plot really intrigues you and you think you can get past all these flaws that I've mentioned, knock yourself out and rent the movie.  Otherwise, you'd probably best just stay away.

Despite my high regard for Die Hard, I think this is better. It succeeds in so many ways.  Firstly, the plot Well, its pretty damn simple, but in this case thats a good thing. A guy has rigged a bus so that if it goes above 50 MPH a bomb is armed and if it drops below that speed again, it blows. I have heard much criticism of this being unrealistic, but I don't see why. Think about the amount of destruction modern technology can cause today, and it seems plausible. Another guy, a cop, is trying to stop the worst from happening by boarding the bus. The Actors\/ Characters Keanu Reeves is excellent and likeable as LAPD officer Jack Traven, the type that fears nothing and will do anything ,no matter how dangerous. Dennis Hopper is the ex - cop that has rigged the bus. This is an incredible performance. In my opinion,in terms of action films, the best bad guy ever and one of the finest pieces of completely addictive acting in any type of film ever. Sandra Bullock is Annie, a normal woman that ends up driving a bus haphazardly through busy city steets at 55 MPH - and she was originally worried about being late for work!! I don't know if she is like this in real life, but if she is, she must get annoying. I don't like this character very much because she screams stupid things and repeats herself all the way through the film. Joe Morton and Jeff Daniels are solid as Jack's superior Mac and his partner Harry. As for the action sequences- they are thrilling, like many people have said, because they are real. They don't rely on special effects at all. And that means they are much more exciting. You are kept on the edge of your seat throughout and that feeling doesn't falter - I have seen this movie LOADS of times and it still excites me in a big way. It really does grip you. This is partly thanks to the fantastic score by Mark Mancina. This makes sure that even if the action starts to bore you, which is unlikely, you are still captivated. The scores' only flaw is that a certain bit of music gets a bit repetitive after a while.

In conclusion, this film is a cracking, thrilling, exhilirating rollercoaster ride of an action movie, that has yet to be equalled. As a piece of entertainment, its brilliant. From a critical perspective, it has only a few minor flaws - i.e Sandra Bullocks infuriating screaming and a few quotes that are very tin - eared and unnatural, which is a shame because what makes this film so great is that the action IS natural, as oppose to obviously CGI. The film fanatic in me loves this film, The critic applauds it. 9 and a 1\/2 out of 10.

Mann does bring realism to the fight scenes in ALI , they`re maybe not as good as the ones in RAGING BULL but they still pack a punch ( Sorry couldn`t resist that one ) , compare the ring scenes here to the laughably bad ones seen in the ROCKY  movies and you`ll notice a big difference . My only criticism of Mann in this film is that a few of the scenes outside the ring lack narritive drive with one of the characters saying something to another character and having the camer a linger too long on the characters moody look , but this is a minor flawThe serious flaw is something everyone else has pointed out and is something that I quickly noticed while watching ALI - The script is too overlong . I hadn`t read the readers comments untill I sat down to write this review so my views weren`t prejudiced but most of the reviewers are spot on , fight scenes feature as do politics , religion , Malcolm X , government spooks and Ali`s marital life and I can`t help thinking the whole film would have worked better if it had just focussed on Ali`s boxing career . As it is ALI isn`t a film I`d watch over and over again like RAGING BULLIt does have a positive point in its favour - The cast .

Highsmith's novels have been favored by a number of international directors, including Hitchcock and Wenders and more recently Minghella's own attempt to get at Mr. Ripley.There is much to like about this movie visually. The views of the Italian Mediterranean, the street scenes in Rome and of village life, even the daytime holiday celebration (fireworks in daylight!) are breathtaking, the sort of thing you hope one day to be able to see on a really big screen. The feel of the movie is right too, effortlessly recreating Italy in the 50s, down to the cars, clothes, food, and people on the street.What's wrong is the characters, a problem most other directors of Highsmith's novels have had. To begin with, the ostensibly American Philippe (Philip) Greenleaf, Tom Ripley, and Marge Duval are most decidedly non-Americans. They don't look like Americans, they don't act like Americans, and they certainly don't move like Americans. Only the character of Freddy Miles is credibly American and then perhaps only because he's in so few scenes.A more serious problem is that Clement doesn't appear to know who Ripley is, or at least doesn't know who Highsmith's Ripley is. In the various Ripley novels, written over a period of nearly forty years, Ripley is an amoral killer who is often forced to murder out of loyalty or to keep his past a secret. In Clement's hands, Ripley is puerile, almost juvenile, with a fairly good motive for hurting Greenleaf. Only during the scenes of Ripley alone on the boat can you catch a glimpse of Highsmith's Ripley. But as soon as he's back in the company of Marge and the others he once again becomes something almost pathetic, almost pathological.Why is it so difficult for film directors to capture certain literary characters? In Ripley's case, perhaps it's because he's neither a basically good character nor a truly bad character. He's somewhere else on the moral landscape, someone who in the novels definitely feels guilt and anguish over what he does, although in Ripley these are not the character-destroying emotions you would expect but rather a kind of painful regret or feeling of disloyalty. Clement's attempts to capture this, if indeed that's what he was trying to do, feel completely wrong. I'm thinking of the several scenes of Ripley ravenously eating after committing a crime. Is Ripley emotionally starved? It's hard to say, but these scenes come across more as black humor than as insights into Ripley's character. At one point, after committing a murder, Ripley gazes out the window at children playing innocently on the street below. Without a narrator, it's hard to figure what's going on in his head here. Guilt? Relief? Longing? Or is he just checking to see if the coast is clear?Purple Noon has great suspense and, despite its trick ending, will remain in your head, vivid and pleasantly memorable, long after viewing. But for readers of Highsmith's novels it will always feel like a bit of a failure.

On one such job, Max captures a fellow officer dealing in stocks in the 1920's and learns that Senator McComb is using time travel to get rich enough to fund his presidency run.  With no evidence Walker goes out to prove McComb is guilty &#150; a battle that occurs in the present as well as the past.For those of you used to the level of logic and plotting that is inherent in Van Damme films (Knock Off anyone?) then Timecop probably stands out as one of his stronger films in terms of plot.  However in comparison to other films to do with time travel then it is still very flawed and has lots of things that don't make a lot of sense if you think about it at any length.  Happily then, this is a film that doesn't require your thoughts &#150; just accept the basic plot details and you'll be set.As such this stands out as one of my favourite Van Damme films.  The plot is more developed and thought through than some of his stuff I have seen lately.  The film allows plenty of basic action scenes that, while not edge of seat stuff, are better than average.  The film manages to build excitement into the basic plot so that it isn't a feeling of stop\/start as we wait for the next fight.  True it's not that advanced but it is all quite good.  In addition to this it has a very well pitched sense of humour that works well.  There are plenty of knowing jokes directed at Van Damme that he takes well (`can he read my mind?' `with your english what choice does he have!?'), these add to the enjoyment value of the film.Van Damme is not great but he does have character and he is probably as good as he has ever been here.  Ron Silver is a very good bad guy and is as greasy as I'd hoped he would be.  McGill and Reuben in support provide a few other well known faces but mostly Van Damme carries the film (never thought I'd be able to say that!).Overall this is not a fantastic film but it does stand as one of Van Damme's better films.  A workable plot, good sense of excitement with solid action scenes, a nice streak of wit running through it results in a film that is miles above the `straight to video' stuff he has been doing of late.

McGill and Reuben in support provide a few other well known faces but mostly Van Damme carries the film (never thought I'd be able to say that!).Overall this is not a fantastic film but it does stand as one of Van Damme's better films.  A workable plot, good sense of excitement with solid action scenes, a nice streak of wit running through it results in a film that is miles above the `straight to video' stuff he has been doing of late.

On one such job, Max captures a fellow officer dealing in stocks in the 1920's and learns that Senator McComb is using time travel to get rich enough to fund his presidency run.  With no evidence Walker goes out to prove McComb is guilty &#150; a battle that occurs in the present as well as the past.For those of you used to the level of logic and plotting that is inherent in Van Damme films (Knock Off anyone?) then Timecop probably stands out as one of his stronger films in terms of plot.  However in comparison to other films to do with time travel then it is still very flawed and has lots of things that don't make a lot of sense if you think about it at any length.  Happily then, this is a film that doesn't require your thoughts &#150; just accept the basic plot details and you'll be set.As such this stands out as one of my favourite Van Damme films.  The plot is more developed and thought through than some of his stuff I have seen lately.  The film allows plenty of basic action scenes that, while not edge of seat stuff, are better than average.  The film manages to build excitement into the basic plot so that it isn't a feeling of stop\/start as we wait for the next fight.  True it's not that advanced but it is all quite good.  In addition to this it has a very well pitched sense of humour that works well.

Whats more, nobody would have cared. This is Hollywood at its Indie best. Trying to pretend that some of their hot properties can be artistic as well. The only problem is that this film is so painfully average and predictable, that few film festivals would have given it the time of day, had it not been for the writers. The story is an old one, just set in a bit of a different setting. Young tough, down on his luck, born poor, no future, gets opportunity and betters himself. Ahhh, what a feel good story. Please! I just love the scene in the bar where Will shows up the cocky Harvard kid on his knowledge of American History. Damon reels off one of the most laughable historical arguments in American History. The information is accurate, but the source is ludicrous. There is no way that his character could make such an argument, even if he had read the authors and understood them. He showed knowledge of the Harvard curriculum that even someone in the Liberal Arts Department would not know. It just strained credibility as this whole movie does. It was an average at best movie that was hyped into a masterpiece. I dismiss the Academy, because I know how the Hollywood Insider game is played. I mean, come on, Kim Bassinger and Mira Sorvino have an Academy! LOL! I mean, Beverly Hills Cop won for best screenplay, even though it had been passed around for five years. In reality, this film is ** out of ****. However, did you know that Matt and Ben wrote it? **** out of ****.
