Even though I didn't go to college in the 80s, the movie brought a lot of memories and I can still relate to many of the conflicts the characters experience. I don't understand why so many people disliked it. It's very much a character driven piece and while many argue that the they are self-absorbed but who isn't at least a little self-absorbed at that age? These characters are trying to find themselves in the 'new' real world of grown-ups. All seven friends are of distinct personalities and even though they are a little clichéd, they remain real and are well played. The friends include -Kirby (Emilio Estevez) who is so desperately 'in love' with a past love that he even changes himself to win her heart.-Billy (Rob Lowe) who is talented, unstable and unpredictable -Kevin (Andrew McCarty) who is following a love that is with someone else.-Jules (Demi Moore) who is the self-destructive flirtatious one striving to protect her outer image while she destroys herself internally.-Alec (Judd Nelson) who is climbing the ladders of success and screwing 'nameless' and 'faceless' chicks while still desperate to marry his girlfriend to make his life perfect.-Leslie (Ally Sheedy) is the girlfriend who wants to have a career of her own before settling down for marriage bliss.-Wendy (Mare Winningham) who is the most selfless one, a frustrated virgin who is striving for independence and love.The actors are brilliantly cast as they fit the parts physically (the right age and looks) and deliver sincere performances. I won't single anyone out as I thought they all did excellent. The supporting cast does not have much scope except for Andie McDowell (who is quite bad).The 80s were known to be a wild and reckless decade for the young ones where it was all about rock and roll, big hair and felt-tips. Foster's soundtrack wonderfully adds to that nostalgic feel of that decade.Through their lives, Schumacher presents different themes such as drugs, alcohol, sex, loyalty, etc. It sounds like just another one of 'those' movies but here it is dealt with in a very real and easily relatable way rather than being overdone. Everyone will recognize at least a couple of the conflicts the characters face. I loved the way it ended. There is no definitive conclusion.

The supporting cast does not have much scope except for Andie McDowell (who is quite bad).The 80s were known to be a wild and reckless decade for the young ones where it was all about rock and roll, big hair and felt-tips. Foster's soundtrack wonderfully adds to that nostalgic feel of that decade.Through their lives, Schumacher presents different themes such as drugs, alcohol, sex, loyalty, etc. It sounds like just another one of 'those' movies but here it is dealt with in a very real and easily relatable way rather than being overdone. Everyone will recognize at least a couple of the conflicts the characters face. I loved the way it ended. There is no definitive conclusion. Instead, what is shown is that the characters are aware that now it is time to grow up and to build their own lives while an uncertain future awaits. It's a great movie.

Where his most commercially successful films have been fantasies with enormous suspension of disbelief and elements of childlike wonder, Schindler's List is unremittingly real, not only in its story and subject matter but in its portrayal of a horrific point in history. One of the most unforgettable sequences I have ever seen in a movie is the SS clearing the Krakow ghetto, sending in hundreds of troops to empty the cramped rooms and shoot anyone who protests, does not cooperate, elderly or infirmed, or for no reason at all. The strange unpredictability of the sequence is masterful, such as the heartbreaking point during when the lone boy desperately tries to find a place to hide. Or when one SS officer plays a piano and carries on a nonchalant discussion while machine guns massacre hiding tenants. As Oskar Schindler, perhaps Liam Neeson's greatest role, watches the carnage from the hills overlooking the area, and is profoundly affected, during one of the most oft-revered employments of color technique in contemporary cinema.Oskar Schindler's story is so purely human, as opposed to what could have been a clearcut good vs. evil storyline in a film depicting the Holocaust. Schindler is a crass businessman from Czechoslovakia who takes advantage of the abundantly cheap work force of Jews to manufacture for the German military. He is a coldly opportunistic member of the Nazi Party, smothering the army with bribes as well as SS officials in charge. Funded by the military, he procures a factory for army mess kits. Not being shrewd enough to suitably run such an enterprise, he develops a connection with Itzhak Stern, played by Ben Kingsley in his best performance next to Sexy Beast, a functionary in the local Jewish Council who has contacts with the now underground Jewish business community in the Ghetto. They loan him the money for the factory in return for a small share of products for black market trade. Schindler makes the Nazis happy and takes pleasure in his wealth and status while Stern actually does the handling of the organization. When Stern suggests Schindler hire Jews instead of Poles because they cost less, this means that the Jews themselves get nothing. Their wages go to the Reich. Schindler's Jews are allowed outside the ghetto though, and Stern fabricate documents to guarantee that as many people as possible are deemed essential by the Nazi bureaucracy, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps.Schindler is not doing any of this to salvage the lives of these people. He's doing it because of the financial benefits. His realization of his advantage to save lives comes slowly as a sincere and valid human evolution and progression. It is an essential unlikely hero story, true, self-effacing without airs, and humbling. It is however current that drives the epic depiction of truly mortifying horrors. There are many scenes even aside from the Krakow ghetto scene that may perhaps create blood clots in your head. Truly the most unforgettable performance is given by Ralph Fiennes, playing SS official Gothe, a relentlessly evil character in the coldest, cruelest sense.

That feeling of enjoyment is from a clever plot, and acting and directing that never lets the story become a farce.The writing, directing (Baltimore's Barry Levenson) and acting are all superb. I particularly appreciated Cate Blanchet's performance as Kate Wheeler, an unappreciated gorgeous wife in despair because she has prepared a fabulous gourmet dinner and then her dolt of a husband decides to skip dinner. (I recently saw a serious drama, The Man Who Cried, in which Cate Blanchett was also terrific. She hadn't come to my attention previously.) Billy Bob Thornton also was great as a neurotic convict\/bank robber, and Bruce Willis uses a tough guy persona that has worked exceedingly well in such previous films as Pulp Fiction. The plot, derived from a true criminal case, is about a pair of convict buddies who break out of prison and begin robbing banks to finance their dream of a plush retirement in Mexico. But they don't like the dangers that ordinary bank robbers risk, so they come up with a novel approach of getting the bank managers to let them into rob the banks in the morning before the bank is open to customers. But when Cate Blanchett's character enters their life, a romantic conflict ensues. Troy Garity is very good as an easily distracted movie stunt man (I don't recall if he was a friend or relative) in need of some excitement who jumps at the opportunity to drive the bank robbers' get-away-car.The story is told as a narrative reflecting back on the events that led up to the narration's current time. The end has a surprise twist that I was able to guess because of something included earlier in the film.If you are old enough or fortunate enough to have seen Alex Guiness' 1950's era classic crime comedies, The Ladykillers and The Lavender Hill Mob, I think you will find that Bandits brings them to mind, despite Bandits being a less broad form of comedy.

That feeling of enjoyment is from a clever plot, and acting and directing that never lets the story become a farce.The writing, directing (Baltimore's Barry Levenson) and acting are all superb. I particularly appreciated Cate Blanchet's performance as Kate Wheeler, an unappreciated gorgeous wife in despair because she has prepared a fabulous gourmet dinner and then her dolt of a husband decides to skip dinner. (I recently saw a serious drama, The Man Who Cried, in which Cate Blanchett was also terrific. She hadn't come to my attention previously.)

Having said that, I have difficulty giving it the status of the classic that so many praise it as. It's a good romantic comedy which I found to be a little slow for the first half hour or so (with the possible exception of the opening scene) that picks up the pace nicely as it moves along. Katharine Hepburn was excellent as the somewhat tormented Tracy, who's come out of a bad first marriage to Dexter (Cary Grant), is now engaged to be married to George (John Howard) while Dexter is still hanging around, and who ultimately becomes smitten with Mike (James Stewart), a society columnist assigned to get a story about the wedding. The real question in the movie is who - if anybody - Tracy is going to end up marrying. Hepburn showed her range of talent - sometimes icy cold, at times falling down drunk and from time to time just hopelessly confused about her feelings. Stewart - who won an Oscar as Best Actor for his role - played an equally tormented character equally well. Mike (or Macauley) is a writer of short stories who accepts a job with Spy magazine (a tabloid sort of paper dealing in gossip about the rich and famous) to make ends meet. He hates his job but has to put a roof over his head. Tracy's wedding is another assignment he hates until he falls for her. Grant's role was a bit more limited, but there was absolutely nothing to fault in it. One cannot review this movie without mentioning the standout performance by Virginia Weidler as Dinah, Tracy's nosy little sister. Her performance was so good that I find it surprising she never really went very far after this. It's a very good movie, mildly funny (even a wee bit risqué at times, at least defined by 1940's standards.)

Expecting this to be one of Full Moon's better films, I watched it and found myself immensely bored, at one point almost falling asleep. Paul LeMat (Golden Globe winner) was an interesting character with interesting hair, but his acting was horrible. And Barbara Crampton shows up, but not nearly long enough (she has a cameo as a carnival attendant).The first hour of this film drags, focusing way too much on back story and characters that are not important and are not interesting. The next fifteen minutes is a bit better. The final ten minutes is decent, but does not redeem the extreme boredom of the beginning. And to think there's like eight or nine sequels to this picture! You know, I like Charles Band (the producer) and I think Ken Hall (the writer) is a great guy, but wow... this film was not half as good as I recalled it being. The number one reason the puppets get the least screen time. Should I blame director David Schmoeller, whose previous work, Crawlspace, puts this film to shame?Blade needs more screen time, and some of them -- Jester, for example -- seem to have no purpose being in the movie at all. Leech Woman was pretty good and rather disgusting, although I wonder how often her power is actually useful. Tunneler was cool, Pinhead was cool... but again... I needed a lot more of them on the screen. The humans were just not worth caring about. Sure, there's an interesting sex scene... but that isn't character development.No Strings Attached featurette is seven minutes, with very brief interviews with David Schmoeller, Paul LeMat, Charles Band and puppet genius David Allen and his crew. It is not particularly revealing, though at seven minutes I guess one cannot expect much. Charlie Band's 5-minute introduction is actually more informative, and you can never get enough of him saying dude. Also, as of 2010, the film is now available restored and remastered -- though it does nothing to make the story better.This film might best be left unwatched for those who want to keep the mystique of Puppet Master alive. Not that the film is awful, but it is not the amazing legend many have made it out to be. Richard Band's cheesy score does not help. A remake would do wonders for this film, as long as they kept within the boundaries of the Full Moon feel. A bit tighter writing, but with comparable special effects, and this would have been a timeless film. Now it is just another memory of mine destroyed and spread throughout the countryside.

Leech Woman was pretty good and rather disgusting, although I wonder how often her power is actually useful. Tunneler was cool, Pinhead was cool... but again... I needed a lot more of them on the screen. The humans were just not worth caring about. Sure, there's an interesting sex scene... but that isn't character development.No Strings Attached featurette is seven minutes, with very brief interviews with David Schmoeller, Paul LeMat, Charles Band and puppet genius David Allen and his crew. It is not particularly revealing, though at seven minutes I guess one cannot expect much. Charlie Band's 5-minute introduction is actually more informative, and you can never get enough of him saying dude. Also, as of 2010, the film is now available restored and remastered -- though it does nothing to make the story better.This film might best be left unwatched for those who want to keep the mystique of Puppet Master alive. Not that the film is awful, but it is not the amazing legend many have made it out to be. Richard Band's cheesy score does not help. A remake would do wonders for this film, as long as they kept within the boundaries of the Full Moon feel. A bit tighter writing, but with comparable special effects, and this would have been a timeless film. Now it is just another memory of mine destroyed and spread throughout the countryside.

But he hides the dolls when Nazis come looking for him. Flash forward to 1989, and a group of magicians and psychics meet in his old home where they find the dolls and find them just a wee bit violent and bloodthirsty. Also, the recently deceased homeowner might not quite be dead.Here's another film from my childhood that comes back to haunt me as an adult. Expecting this to be one of Full Moon's better films, I watched it and found myself immensely bored, at one point almost falling asleep. Paul LeMat (Golden Globe winner) was an interesting character with interesting hair, but his acting was horrible. And Barbara Crampton shows up, but not nearly long enough (she has a cameo as a carnival attendant).The first hour of this film drags, focusing way too much on back story and characters that are not important and are not interesting. The next fifteen minutes is a bit better. The final ten minutes is decent, but does not redeem the extreme boredom of the beginning. And to think there's like eight or nine sequels to this picture!

In retrospect, the offer doesn't sound so ridiculous Burton's take on the Dark Knight is as much a freak show as Raising Arizona, though it is more about the sombre mood than surreal humor, which is the Coens' most notable strength.The absolute lunacy in this film comes in the form of H.I. McDunnough (Nicolas Cage), a convict who is absolutely incapable of doing any good whatsoever, and his wife Edwina, nicknamed Ed (Holly Hunter), a prison worker who married him after his latest stay in jail. The couple's biggest wish is to have a baby, but as it turns out nature - and luck - isn't really on their side. At this point, options are quite limited, and after learning wealthy businessman Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson) has recently had five babies, they think who cares if one of those kids disappears ? Apparently, a lot of people care, since H.I. and Ed have to deal with all kinds of insane individuals, from the Snoat brothers (John Goodman and William Forsythe) to a mysterious biker (Tex Cobb) who seems to have come straight out of Hell.Raising Arizona is, in many ways, a typical Coen brothers movie, relying not on easy or direct laughs, but more on the overall absurdity of the situation, paired with some healthy Reagan-bashing (H.I. starts insulting him in the opening monologue). That the satirical aspect isn't forced, but manages to flow naturally with the rest of the craziness, is one of the film's strongest aspects, next to the fantastic dialogue (Hurry up, I'm in a dutch with the wife!) and the inspired casting Hunter and Frances McDormand, working with Joel and Ethan for the second time, are already at ease in the twisted Coen universe, while Goodman and Forsythe add the right does of quirkiness. The most impressive performance comes from Cage still in his experimental phase (Wild at Heart was just around the corner), he is totally out of control in an edgy, brave effort whose wild energy is only a vague memory in his post-Oscar body of work. Cobb is good as well, but his character, who adds a more surreal touch to the movie's tone, doesn't seem quite at home here. The Coens have used the Hell motif in other pictures (Barton Fink first and foremost) to considerable effect, but in this case it looks more like an afterthought, albeit an entertaining one, rather than an organic part of the narrative.Despite its occasional flaws, Raising Arizona is in fact a perfect film for Coen novices, its accessibility and mainstream appeal (it's got Nic Cage in it) being potentially more seductive than the casual yet beautiful brutality of Fargo.

Educational filmmaker Herk Harvey decided to make an Ingrid Bergman-influenced horror film... in Manhattan, Kansas of all places. Like The Blair Witch Project, Carnival of Souls has almost no budget ($33,000) and utilizes the viewer's imagination to fill in the unseen, spooky details in lieu of pricey special effects. Souls' zombies greatly influenced George Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968), and Souls' twist ending is the inspiration for M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense. In a recent edition of Entertainment Weekly, horrormeister Stephen King singles out Carnival of Souls as one of five movies that are scary precisely because they have low budgets.Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) is the sole survivor of a car that drove off a bridge into a river. She travels to Utah to start her new job as a church organist, but before she reaches her destination she's drawn to an abandoned carnival pavilion in the middle of nowhere. Mary is very asocial and high strung, and after a while she starts freaking out when she keeps seeing a ghoulish man (Herk Harvey) and experiences bouts of being invisible to everyone around her. A psychiatrist tries to help her, but her hysteria builds until she is driven to the old pavilion, where a ballroom full of dancing ghouls start chasing her.I'm just amazed by how effectively haunting, memorable, and unique this low-budget film is. Herk Harvey and his crew overachieved and created a film with a lot of mystique. Candace Hilligoss is mesmerizing. She's in every scene, and her ethereal beauty perfectly matches Mary's sense of aloofness in relation to the small-town locals around her. Francis Feist makes an impression as Mary's boarding house landlady, and Sidney Berger is wonderfully sleazy as Mary's creepy lothario of a housemate. Herk Harvey has a great look and presence as the chief ghoul hounding Mary's soul. Maurice Prather's cinematography and Gene Moore's organ-tastic soundtrack help create tremendously spooky atmosphere.Psychological and existential themes aren't explicitly addressed, but they're at work at a deeper level, inducing some serious musings about identity and existence. Mary is a church organist, but she only considers it a job and wants nothing to do with the religious aspects of the position. Are ghouls hounding her because she has no faith in God and is irreligious? Or is Carnival of Souls a morality play? Mary is depicted as asocial, becoming uncomfortable when other people get too close to her.
