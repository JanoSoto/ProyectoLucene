Actually it's more of a guy film, and probably why it got so many bad reviews and rating, and why a movie so great could be so under-appreciated. Some women who will see this film will see a guy being dumped trying to win the girl back and obsessing about her will immediately feel disgusted and say Ewwww! What a creep! They just don't understand what real love is in real life and how complicated it is for guys, especially nice guys. Let me explain - This movie is a Romantic movie with comedy in it, people in love, however ITs a Dark romantic film, it's realistic kind of love, not the one that we are usually are being fed with by most romantic chick films. This movie is about betrayal, obsession and what love is really all about. If you are a guy who ever experienced being dumped or rejected by women after trying so hard to be a nice guy and win a girl heart with love, kindness and basically being a doormat and have your heart broken - This is the movie you must see. Because We all have a little Sam in us who wants to believe in true love, sometimes we are a bit hung up on past lovers and we all stalked our ex's, if it's on Facebook or through friends, and sometimes we still want to love that special someone that dumped us and we are positive that person will realize the mistake he has done and come running back... This is why this movie is so unique, a movie that will leave a mark on you after you watch it.I've first watched it when I was just a kid, and 12 years later I still remember it and have to watch it again and again&#x85; I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.

The uncontested fact that it's an essential science fiction will remain true throughout the history. Ridley Scott changed to way most people look at this genre and started a trend that many directors wanted to follow. That shouldn't surprise anyone, knowing that a picture like this comes only a few times in the history.The director was capable of creating and developing a frantically majestic universe, in which he placed the whole story about the horrible adventure of the Nostromo mining ship. No one can deny that the method Mr. Scott used to hypnotize the viewers continues to be fresh and very original even now, more than 30 years ago.The masterful editing of the movie creates a visually perfect atmosphere that is able to draw attention and scare in the most stunning, and intelligent way. Combined with the eerie music and the specific, very dark and sombre tone in most of the scenes, they create an unforgettable movie experience.The fact that the extraterrestrial creature, which roams around the ship killing all of the passengers one after another, is shown only for a slight second accounts for the fact that the movie is more fascinating and riveting. It isn't like in most of the horrors that we are used to, where the killer is constantly on-screen, running around and murdering his victims in an absurd manner. No, the way the Alien does it is utterly distinctive. He does it quietly, without any unnecessary exposures. The viewer is waiting for him to show up, but he never does. All we see is the empty corridors, surrounded by a gloomy fog of uncertainty.The seven passengers try everything to get rid of the uninvited guest. Unfortunately, in an encounter with the mysterious monster they are hopeless, and it seems that their ship would be lost in the vast space for all eternity. This is the moment when an unexpected hero emerges. Or a heroine, I should say. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was able to handle the situation, being left alone after all the other crew members have been killed. She stayed put, in control of the situation, and outsmarted the creature in the final sequence.In the person of Sigourney Weaver the world finally got a strong and brave woman, who was able to withhold any devastating circumstances and still fight when all hope seemed to have been lost. Her performance is breathtaking, so real and believable that when she fears for her life every person watching her is scared to death too.The visual and special effects (sadly, the only Oscar that the movie got) are on the highest level all the time - the opening scene showing the enormous universe surrounding Nostromo; when it lands on a distant planet just to discover another life form; during the tantalizing on-board hunt.The scene of a bursting stomach, when a little Alien is born will come down in history as one of the most memorable ever.All in all, the spellbinding atmosphere, the unconventional tone, the remarkable story, the well- developed characters, the unexpected twists, the thrilling suspense, the mystery behind the unknown (the list could just go on and on) &#x96; all of those factors put together give reason for calling Alien one of the best science-fiction movies of all times.

You may get the feeling that Jeff (James Stewart) is kind of peeping tom in the sense that he just sits in his wheelchair all day and watches what his neighbors do, but you have to realize that in a sense, you are doing the same thing as you watch the movie. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat just basically because you never know what is going to happen next. You get to form your own ideas and opinions throughout the movie, because a lot of things happen to make you believe his neighbor killed his wife, but at the same time, Jeff's friend the detective makes you believe that nothing really happened. You never really find out until Jeff's girlfriend is in the neighbors apartment herself, trying to find her own clues. The most pivotal moment in this movie is near the end when Jeff's neighbor is in his apartment. You don't know whether or not he is going to kill Jeff, or if he is going to ask him why he is watching him because you still aren't sure whether or not he killed his wife. In this scene it is dark, the only light is coming from the street lights outside. You can see the outline of his neighbor and of him. You see the man up close as Jeff flashes the light bulb to one of his camera's, as he walks up to Jeff. Jeff is defenseless and alone in his wheelchair and when I found out the neighbors intentions I could feel anxiety and stress, wondering what was going to happen next. That is what I truly loved most about this movie. I love a movie that keeps me guessing, and gets my heart beating a little faster. This movie does all of those things, and it doesn't leave you guessing at the end. You know that the bad guy goes to jail, the good guy survives, and you even get to see how his neighbors come together at the end and all seem to be friends and become closer after what has happened. It also shows you how Jeff and his girlfriend become closer. It let's you know what happens in the end, and I love that because it seems that most movies these days leave you guessing and never gives you a picture of what happens next without adding on thirty minutes to the movie.

It made me interested in all these other people's lives by showing brief glimpses of everyone from the rear window's of their apartments. You may get the feeling that Jeff (James Stewart) is kind of peeping tom in the sense that he just sits in his wheelchair all day and watches what his neighbors do, but you have to realize that in a sense, you are doing the same thing as you watch the movie. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat just basically because you never know what is going to happen next. You get to form your own ideas and opinions throughout the movie, because a lot of things happen to make you believe his neighbor killed his wife, but at the same time, Jeff's friend the detective makes you believe that nothing really happened. You never really find out until Jeff's girlfriend is in the neighbors apartment herself, trying to find her own clues. The most pivotal moment in this movie is near the end when Jeff's neighbor is in his apartment. You don't know whether or not he is going to kill Jeff, or if he is going to ask him why he is watching him because you still aren't sure whether or not he killed his wife. In this scene it is dark, the only light is coming from the street lights outside. You can see the outline of his neighbor and of him. You see the man up close as Jeff flashes the light bulb to one of his camera's, as he walks up to Jeff. Jeff is defenseless and alone in his wheelchair and when I found out the neighbors intentions I could feel anxiety and stress, wondering what was going to happen next. That is what I truly loved most about this movie. I love a movie that keeps me guessing, and gets my heart beating a little faster. This movie does all of those things, and it doesn't leave you guessing at the end. You know that the bad guy goes to jail, the good guy survives, and you even get to see how his neighbors come together at the end and all seem to be friends and become closer after what has happened.

This is a great action, drama, mystery movie all wrapped up into one. It is a movie about five criminals that are well known in New York. These five criminals were initially brought in for a police lineup but then the movie really builds from there. These five criminals all vow to get back at the police force. This takes them on a journey of criminal activity. First they get back at the cops by exposing dirty cops. Then they start working other various jobs together. Then one turning point in the film is that they are called upon by Kaiser Sosa to take on a dangerous job. Kaiser Sozas character is then built as spooky, vicious underworld figure that even the most notorious criminals are afraid of.There are five main characters that this movie is based around. Verbal Klint, played by Kevin Spacey is a crippled conman that doesn't like violence. Michael McManus, played by Stephen Baldwin, is a top level entry man that is deemed to be a little psychotic. Todd Hockney, played be Kevin Pollak, is a hardened criminal wise cracker. Fred Fenster, played by Benicio Del Toro, is a partner of Michael McManus. Dean Keaton, played by Gabriel Byrne, was and ex cop turned notorious crook.The movie goes throw many flashbacks to give you pieces to the big puzzle that unfolds. There are many details in this movie and after watching it 30+ times I still don't understand all of it. Maybe Bryan Singer wanted it that way, to keep you intrigued and wondering.The movie really was edited and directed in very sophisticated way. All scenes were masterfully directed. The lighting was great in various sense throughout the moving. This lighting really accentuated the scenes. All of these aspects gave the film a great visual style and a truly grandiouse feel.This movie continually builds to the conclusion. In the end of the movie Kevin Spacey pulls off a great performance. He is being interrogated by agent Kujan. Verbal Klint is making up a very details story about what he is being interrogated about. As soon as Verbal is released Kujan realizes that he had been duped. Virbal then enlightens the viewers that he is the notorious non gimpy criminal called Kaiser Sosa.This movie really doesn't have a parity that I am aware of.

One of the assignments is to write a post or add to a post of a movie of our choice. I chose Gone with the Wind because it has to be one of my favorite movies. Katie Scarlett O'Hara-Hamilton-Kennedy-Butler has to be one of the best female roles in film to me. When she is depicted before the Civil War, she is immediately shown with two beaus at her house on a beautiful summer's day. When the two young men start speaking of war she explains that talk of war bores her. As the two beaus continue to ask about war, Scarlett begins to retreat into the house. The men suddenly come to their senses and apologize, while saying they will not talk about war anymore. It is here we see Scarlett does get her way. As they change the subject to the barbecue at the Wilkes', a neighbor's plantation, she is stunned to find out that the love of life is marrying his cousin (just have to add that I am glad people do not do that anymore)! Scarlett immediately storms off in anger and confusion, wondering how that could be if Ashley, her crush, loves her. While storming off she is told by her Mammy that it was rude to leave the company standing there without asking them to stay for dinner and that she needs a shawl on her shoulders if she is going to be out in the evening. Scarlett yells back that she is waiting for her father to get home from the Wilkes', to get the inside information on what is really going on. The movie takes place in the south, before, during, and after the Civil War era, when slavery was the largest problem of the United States. To Scarlett, war was a stupid problem that she never wanted to talk about; she was happy having every beau in the county sit next to her at a barbecue and drool all over her. Even though her love for Ashley never wavered, she married three men throughout her life as a means to survive. I do not think she was just trying to survive for herself, I think she showed that she had heart and truly cared for her family when she married Frank Kennedy. Knowing that Frank was Suellen's beau, I think she figured once Suellen and Frank were married that they would leave and would no longer have to worry about Tara and the rest of the family. Therefore, Scarlett married Frank and paid the taxes on Tara so the family would have a home. A selfish person would not have done that, a person with no morals might have.Really looking at Katie Scarlett O'Hara-Hamilton-Kennedy-Butler, she married her first husband as a tactic to make Ashley jealous. It did not work, and as a result, she ended up being a young widow. Scarlett did not love Charles Hamilton, she took advantage of his love for her, when he asks her to marry him all the while Scarlett is looking out the large window at Ashley and Melanie kissing goodbye. Though it was sad that Charles died, it feels like Scarlett was getting what she deserved. Marrying her second husband Frank, she guaranteed the home and land for her family to live on. Even though Frank was Scarlett's sister Suellen's beau, she lied to him, as well. Scarlett told Frank that her sister was tired of waiting for him, that Suellen thought she would be an old maid, so she married a boy in the county they lived in. Telling this awful lie on her sister, caused Frank to marry Scarlett, which allowed her to use his money and pay the taxes on Tara. With her final marriage to Rhett Butler, it seemed like she married him for his money. I think that Scarlett did not want to be alone. The last scene before the intermission, Scarlett has made it home with Melanie, her baby, and Prissy, her simple-minded slave, to find that the day before her mother had died, which pushed her into the role of the head of the household. Having nothing to eat and nothing of value, she finds herself in the garden outside. Having nothing in it but radishes, Scarlett grabs one and starts to eat it, she immediately gets sick and falls to the ground, crying. When she collects herself, she stands and makes a pledge that she will never go hungry again, nor any of her folks; if she has to lie, steal, cheat, or kill as God as her witness she will never be hungry again. That promise, to me, sounds like she is a woman who has seen and been defeated by outside forces that she had no control over. I admire Scarlett because she was in fact a woman, living in a world of a great revolution. Even though the Civil War was fighting for the freedom of the slavery, women were still seen as dainty things, of little to no importance to men. She proved to be a smart woman, with a mind for business and the strong will to handle personal problems when they arose, as seen with the shooting of the Union soldier who doubled-back after the army had left Tara. I think she was always protecting her family, even though she did not see the true love that Rhett had for her until Melanie died, when he left her, Scarlett went home to Tara to solve her problems.

An environment where you know your neighbours and enjoy your neighbourhood? Not according to this movie!Ray (Tom Hanks) is your average suburbanite. He has a quiet life with his wife (Carrie Fisher) and family. He's trying to spend a quiet week of vacation at home when a couple of his buddies (played by Bruce Dern and Rick Ducommun) convince him that there's something suspicious about the new neighbours who've moved in next door. They've been there for a month; no one has seen them. The house is run down, the grass is unkept. An elderly neighbour has suspiciously gone missing. Something must be wrong. The movie basically unfolds the mystery of these new neighbours and it does that pretty well, so that once they're introduced you do go back and forth between thinking that they're just plain weird and thinking that they're weirdly sinister. Director Joe Dante builds this well. The first hour or so is really fairly low key, and the last 45 minutes starts the buildup to a wild and chaotic conclusion.There are parts of this that are quite funny.

The thrill I felt as the opening credit sequence flashed across the screen in sync with the dynamic Bond theme will live forever in my memory and the film as it unfolded was then an induction into the adult world of sophistication. I didn't get the dark tongue-in-cheek humor nor did I question just how Dr No built and ran an undersea, nuclear powered plant designed to interfere with U.S. missile tests, nor why he and SPECTRE would go to all this trouble to upset the Yanks. But, as an adult, I understand why I and the rest of the world withheld our disbelief and went on the ride.Dr No was and remains a triumph of style over substance. In the hands of less skilled film makers, it would have been a B grade potboiler but because it was made by an extraordinarily talented and sophisticated team who had sprung from backgrounds that allowed them to make a multi- million dollar film on a budget of less than a million, it worked beyond all expectations. Of course Connery was the key but who would have had the foresight to discern just how right he would be for the part before he proved he could do it? Some say he grew into the part but that is not true. Watch the first scene he ever did as Bond when he walks through the airport in Jamaica. The confidently casual stride and the almost nonchalant shielding of his face with his hat to deny a female enemy agent a photo of him are indicative of a secret agent who is in command of the situation. When at the end of the sequence Bond deduces that the driver, Mr Jones, is also an enemy agent, Connery delivers a look that is to be pure Bond from then on. There is a sense of ruthlessness and a darkly gratuitous anticipation of what is to come when dealing with an adversary that made Connery as Bond so exciting and credible. He was Bond from the beginning as much as Dr No was the blueprint for the Bond series. This is what made Dr No as the first in the Bond series so remarkable. The first in the series needed almost no future tweaking. The prior-to-the-title, mini-adventure sequence was perhaps the only real improvement made in subsequent Bond films. Probably the only Bond film to break many of the Bond conventions set in Dr No was From Russia with Love. F.R.W.L. was almost a regulation spy versus spy story with the stakes set a lot lower than world domination or cornering the world market in gold. After this, Bond films were Dr No in almost every respect. The gadgets may have become more high tech than a Geiger counter and the stunts went beyond car chases and fist fights but in essence they were Dr No set in a different country and with another super-villain displaying the same confidence in his own ability that Joseph Wiseman's unnerving control of face and voice evinced.What a feat of film making was Dr No! It was made in 1962 which was in many ways the last year of the 1950's. By 1963, Dr No had ushered in the 60's as surely as The Beatles and Cassius Clay who also appeared as if on cue.

After the success of the original Terms of Endearment, it was no surprise a sequel was in the works. In fact, as a viewer, I loved finding out what happened to the existing characters. I know at the end of Terms of Endearment, Flap Horton agreed to have Emma's mother raise his children---In this one, he seems to abandon them all together, which I don't think Flap--even though he is a rotter---would he do this? Well, on with the plot...Not all happy endings after Emma's death. Tommy is in jail, Teddy is somewhat nebbish but seems to try and do the right thing at times. Baby Melanie has grown into a pretty but defiant boy crazy teen which drives strong willed Aurora even more crazy.In The Evening Star we see two new character--one old in the earlier film who now has a much bigger part---Rosie Dunlop, Aurora's maid superbly acted by Marion Ross (who played Mrs C in Happy Days) Here we see Rosie had a much greater impact on Aurora's life as not just a maid but as an extended family member. And Rosie feels the same way as she tries to guide Aurora thru life's problems. This time Aurora suffers besides her grandchildrens crisis, she seems to be going thru a change of life or mid life crisis. On advise, she goes to a psychiatrist, played by Bill Paxton, who seems half her age.---and seduces him. I know that this seems to show the audience that Aurora, even though she approaches her elderly years--that she still has got it. It just seems as a silly superficial not needed sub plot line.One of the most disappointing outcome of the characters from the past movie is Emma's best friend, Patsy Carpenter. In the original movie, Patsy was a self sufficient, sleek well groomed career girl. In the Evening Star somehow she has morphed into a debauched drunken alcoholic only after the money from men that she preys on. She and Aurora are immensely jealous of each other and compete from Emma's children attention and love. I suppose this sub plot is put in for comic relief, it just seems so silly and detached from the characters.And of course, Aurora's love Garret comes back for a brief appearance but jack Nicholson just doesn't have the same pizazz as before. He seems to look as someone is making him star in this movie--just my imagination-you be the judge.The remainder of the film, now focuses on the end of Aurora's days after all her grandchildren have come to terms with there problems. It is very sad and will probably make you think of the emotional scene of Emma's death. The Evening Star is an entertaining film to watch. But I say if you haven't watched Terms of Endearment before it, you may not have the same impact from the original.

Baby Melanie has grown into a pretty but defiant boy crazy teen which drives strong willed Aurora even more crazy.In The Evening Star we see two new character--one old in the earlier film who now has a much bigger part---Rosie Dunlop, Aurora's maid superbly acted by Marion Ross (who played Mrs C in Happy Days) Here we see Rosie had a much greater impact on Aurora's life as not just a maid but as an extended family member. And Rosie feels the same way as she tries to guide Aurora thru life's problems. This time Aurora suffers besides her grandchildrens crisis, she seems to be going thru a change of life or mid life crisis. On advise, she goes to a psychiatrist, played by Bill Paxton, who seems half her age.---and seduces him. I know that this seems to show the audience that Aurora, even though she approaches her elderly years--that she still has got it. It just seems as a silly superficial not needed sub plot line.One of the most disappointing outcome of the characters from the past movie is Emma's best friend, Patsy Carpenter. In the original movie, Patsy was a self sufficient, sleek well groomed career girl. In the Evening Star somehow she has morphed into a debauched drunken alcoholic only after the money from men that she preys on. She and Aurora are immensely jealous of each other and compete from Emma's children attention and love. I suppose this sub plot is put in for comic relief, it just seems so silly and detached from the characters.And of course, Aurora's love Garret comes back for a brief appearance but jack Nicholson just doesn't have the same pizazz as before. He seems to look as someone is making him star in this movie--just my imagination-you be the judge.The remainder of the film, now focuses on the end of Aurora's days after all her grandchildren have come to terms with there problems. It is very sad and will probably make you think of the emotional scene of Emma's death. The Evening Star is an entertaining film to watch. But I say if you haven't watched Terms of Endearment before it, you may not have the same impact from the original.

If anything, it tries to do too much when Ripley crash lands on a sparsely-populated prison planet, she stumbles into no less than a dozen unique plot points and divergent story lines. Paired with the natural hide-and-seek drama surrounding the alien itself, a closer look at one or two of those may have resulted in a textured, interesting picture. Instead, first-time director David Fincher tries to delve into the lot of them, which often shuffles the alien to the backburner and discovers - after the fact - that they each didn't deserve such a microscopic analysis. That leads to a film with neither a distinct personality nor a purpose which is, often, inconceivably dull. By the time it gets around to wrapping things up, in an admittedly sharp, ballsy climax, the moment is already tarnished and wasted. Even the alien effects, which were so convincing and outstanding in the first two pictures, seem like a watered down afterthought in this chapter.
