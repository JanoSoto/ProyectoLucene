But still I think it would be safe to say that this is a movie that nobody would've missed if it wouldn't have been made. The story (teenage siblings get in the way of a man-eating supernatural monster that decides to put one of them on that night's menu)is very weak to begin with, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the movie should be bad. Lots of Wes Craven flicks have an even thinner plot, but still work. I'm still trying to figure out why Jeepers Creepers doesn't. The acting is okay, the special effects are not that bad and the overall look and feel of the movie is convincing, even on a far from perfect monitor.  Maybe it's just the fact that everything this movie wants to do has been done before. Every element you'd expect in a middle of the road horror movie is there, turning the story into a sad vehicle that has to come to a halt at all the far too familiar stops. There's the teenagers to begin with, followed by their discovery of the ghoul and their predictable decision not to run for their lives but to go back and investigate the terrors that they could've just walked away from. There's also a number of 'false alarms', moments that should make you jump while actually there's nothing to be scared of. Well... I didn't jump. The mid section of the movie is 'the hunt'. The monster works his way to the main characters and kills a number of irrelevant victims while he's at it. It is in this part of the movie that, as an afterthought, a psychic woman is introduced who's supposed to shed some light on the otherwise meaningless proceedings of the monster. However, the only important thing she knows is that either the brother or the sister will be the final victim and when she finally arrives at the scene this dreadful fact is just about to happen and her psychic viewings don't help a thing!The only good thing about the ending of the movie is the fact that the makers had the guts to let one of the main characters die. The bad thing is that the monster survived, so guess what... the sequel is already in the making.I'm still not very sure why I found this movie so boring. I've seen other predictable horror movies that still amused me. Maybe the teenage-slasher genre is finally dead after the Scream series made explicit fun of its rules and cliches.

Feel free to judge me&#133;), she becomes more and more clownish. This is kind of like the remake of Psycho, it just wasn't necessary, and also like Psycho, The Village of the Damned is a film that's better in black and white. Shooting it in color takes away a lot of the potential that the movie had to be really creepy and scary. It brings the story itself too much into the light of reality, and the subject matter of a film like this does not stand up very well in the light of reality. This is probably why so many horror films fall completely flat. Maybe if they would come out with more horror films in black and white the genre would not be in such a sad state. With horror films especially, less most definitely is more. There were some other things changed or added in this version that were just frivolous and unnecessary. The increased violence, for example, did absolutely nothing for the story and just reminds us of some disappointing changes that have taken place between the audience of the 1960 version and the audience of the 1995 version. Have we really decayed so much that we need more and more violence in the movies to keep us entertained? I shudder to think.This is one of those movies that I watched when I was in high school and absolutely loved it. I was fascinated with the whole concept of a whole town losing consciousness because of some passing cloud of evil and a few of the women turning up mysteriously pregnant. I loved the mysteriousness of the movie, I was terrified out of my seat, and was overall enormously impressed. But I was in high school. I loved a lot of stupid movies in high school. Kind of like Armageddon. Now that I know something about movies I can look at something like this with a little bit more of an informed point of view. The story is undeniably interesting, but it was just as interesting in the original. I am sad to see that the great John Carpenter, one of the better directors of the horror genre, has directed a completely unnecessary remake of a film that could only be made worse with the addition of color and all kinds of augmented violence and goofy special effects.

I actually only saw it because I'm completely obsessed with Matthew Lillard (Stevo) but after I saw it I was like, wow. Every guy I know hates this movie and every girl loves it. i think it's because of all the eye candy! I mean you have matthew Lillard (stevo), Michael Goorjian (Heroin Bob), Devon Sawa (Sean), Til Schweiger (Mark), and some girls like me like Adam Pascal who plays Eddie. But this definately is NOT the reason that I love this movie. The acting is incredible! A lot of people say that there is no plot and everything is confusing but what the director was trying to do was make everything seem mixed up and out of order to show Stevo's confusion as he's trying to find his identity. Trust me on this. I've watched the movie about 50 times (litterally) and have even listened to the directors commentary. All the actors are great even if I hate some of the characters (basically every female character except Jennifer and Trish, Stevo's mom is just an insult to women if you realize how passive she is and how she follows whatever his dad says) Anyway, Matthew does an amazing job. He lets out his humorous side while still showing everyone his problems and confusion. You just have to love Michael Goorjian and Devon Sawa who definately play my favorite characters in this movie. Til Schweiger is just awesome! I mean his character is just hilarious even though you do feel kind of bad for him (watch the movie and find out why) Damn! he knows how to hold a gun! Basically this movie is overall just a really cool, funny yet sad, well- acted, fun mind trip. I'll bet though that if you're a guy you probably won't like it but it is two of the girl's I have shown it to's favorite movie now. The third just likes it A LOT! If you still believe it sucks and you're a girl, just see it mainly for the guys. If you're a guy and think it's gonna suck, maybe you'll like Summer Pheonix (yuck!) or Anabeth Gish (she's the prettiest one in the film)Just see the movie and decide for yourself. I can't tell you to like it or not. ","genre":null},{"date":"10 September 2002","score":"","review":"  I don't know what I was expecting from this film.

I mean you have matthew Lillard (stevo), Michael Goorjian (Heroin Bob), Devon Sawa (Sean), Til Schweiger (Mark), and some girls like me like Adam Pascal who plays Eddie. But this definately is NOT the reason that I love this movie. The acting is incredible! A lot of people say that there is no plot and everything is confusing but what the director was trying to do was make everything seem mixed up and out of order to show Stevo's confusion as he's trying to find his identity. Trust me on this. I've watched the movie about 50 times (litterally) and have even listened to the directors commentary. All the actors are great even if I hate some of the characters (basically every female character except Jennifer and Trish, Stevo's mom is just an insult to women if you realize how passive she is and how she follows whatever his dad says) Anyway, Matthew does an amazing job. He lets out his humorous side while still showing everyone his problems and confusion. You just have to love Michael Goorjian and Devon Sawa who definately play my favorite characters in this movie. Til Schweiger is just awesome! I mean his character is just hilarious even though you do feel kind of bad for him (watch the movie and find out why) Damn! he knows how to hold a gun! Basically this movie is overall just a really cool, funny yet sad, well- acted, fun mind trip. I'll bet though that if you're a guy you probably won't like it but it is two of the girl's I have shown it to's favorite movie now. The third just likes it A LOT! If you still believe it sucks and you're a girl, just see it mainly for the guys. If you're a guy and think it's gonna suck, maybe you'll like Summer Pheonix (yuck!) or Anabeth Gish (she's the prettiest one in the film)Just see the movie and decide for yourself. I can't tell you to like it or not. ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music"},{"date":"10 September 2002","score":"","review":"  I don't know what I was expecting from this film.

At the time that I saw the movie however I was a bit upset with the RE series I had just beaten Code Veronica X and was disappointed by the fact that is was just a 128-bit RE nothing really new and wasn't scary at all.  But that aside I had seen the add for it and thought it might be mindless fun. I knew Paul Anderson was directing it and I had seen Event Horizon prior to this movie.  I thought Event Horizon was decent and quite scary so with that and the fact that RE is a video game movie i wasn't expecting to much. Well wasn't I surprised because this is the best movie of 2002 yet and probably the most well made horror film since The Thing.  The acting is well on and any bad actors seem to be killed in the beginning.  SPOILER Like the two guys in the laser hall who has his fingers cut off and then the guy who is cut in half END SPOILER. Milla does a fine job granted she isn't given as big a roll as say Joan of Arc this time but she definitely does a better job here then in that movie. Not since ALIEN have I seen a film with so much atmosphere which is definitely helped by the score by Marilyn Manson.Clearly Paul Anderson was the right way to go, had Romero done this it would have been a movie that went into the true evils of the Umbrella Corp.  Also Anderson seems to know more about RE then even someone like me even the train that they ride on is identical to the one in 2 (it says ALEXI 3000 or something in the front of the train). The only real problem is some clear cut exposition in the intro and a bit in the beginning but as the s?*! starts to hit the fan there is no more explaining.I can't recommed a better modern horror movie the production values are amazing.  Granted maybe my understanding of the game helps me like this movie so much which by the way is very faithful to the game even if there are different characters.  Great Movie.

A satire?  A serious film inculcating moral values?  A drama about dead-end lives in Middle America?  What, what, what?  It works as none of the above.I'd retitle this film The Stupid Girl.  Here we have Justine, a thirty-year-old woman who appears to be of normal intelligence.  She's married to Phil, a pot-smoking slob who works as a house painter.  For the past seven years, Justine has worked at the cosmetic counter of Retail Rodeo, the film's version of K-Mart or Wal-Mart.  She's bored to death with her life.So, Justine, why don't you do something about this situation?  You are childless, therefore, without the pressing responsibilities of raising children.  Even in this Podunk area of the world, there must be a community college nearby where you could take courses in the evening or daytime (I'm sure Retail Rodeo could give you a work schedule to accommodate your school schedule).  And you could begin to make a life for yourself.As shown here, Justine doesn't even have a hobby.  She does nothing but work at Retail Rodeo, come home, and flip on the TV in her bedroom.Nothing in the film made me want to laugh at Justine.  Yet, I couldn't feel an iota of sympathy for Justine or any of the other characters in this film, for none was shown to be doing a thing to better himself in life.The film's plot is implausible at many points.  Most implausible of all is that Justine didn't simply dump everything and go.  There are always defining moments in everyone's life, that moment when we must take the plunge, go off the high diving board for whatever reason.  For some, that reason is utter boredom or a pileup of events that make a person's current life untenable.  Justine doesn't have such a defining moment here.  Is that testimony to her complete and utter stupidity?  I guess I'm to assume so, which further alienates me for her character.I went to this film with high expectations.  Director Arteta had previously made Chuck and Buck and Star Maps, both of which I liked.  Mike White wrote the screenplay here; he'd done the same for Chuck and Buck.Jennifer Aniston, who plays the lead, has a major TV career in Friends.  But I do not watch TV, so I have never before seen her.  Apparently, many viewers were impressed with Aniston here because this part is so different from the part she plays in Friends.  I don't know that such a difference automatically means good acting.It's astonishing how similar Toby Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal are.  Maybe Maguire cloned himself and will make the Spiderman sequels and other mainstream films under his Maguire name and the art and indy films under the Gyllenhaal name.  Well, whatever his name, I like him.I left the film feeling irritated that I had spent 93 minutes of my time in the company of such losers.
