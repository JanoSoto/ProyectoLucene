James is an abusive husband, and it makes you wonder what the hell Joyce was thinking getting married to this guy (and him too, since he obviously didn't care about her). She saw his true personality from the start, since they argued about pure nonsense even at the wedding. He's just a no good guy. The guy you love to hate.Joyce always threatens to kill her husband, according to Cynthia. But, she never really goes through with it. Until one night at a carnival, when James's antics just get to be more than Joyce can take. Cynthia sure was wishing she didn't tag along, especially when Joyce shows her James bleeding to death in the back of the van, and hopeless Joyce admitting that she accidentally stabbed her husband.In one agonizingly long sequence of flashback events leading all the way up to Cynthia's decision to testify, she tells the interrogating detectives (including one Harvey Keitel) how she helped cover up the murder to protect her best friend, Joyce. But, one lie after another about what really happened seem to be a mounting problem for Cynthia more than Joyce because she seems to be the one left doing all the dirty work. What looked like helping a friend suddenly turns into a game of revenge. Suddenly, going to the cops right away after James's death doesn't look so bad now, considering the consequences Cynthia, more than Joyce, faces if she were caught. I suppose, with her confession, she hopes the police will go easy on both her and Joyce.All the while, we revert back to this interrogation, as the detectives are reviewing Cynthia's stories for loopholes, making her nervous as they point out her contradictions. And this is suppose to get our attention, not just push along the flashbacks because they never change even though her testimony may in order to accommodate the policeman's questions. But, sometimes it is just boring nitpicking rather than something that might make us consider that Cynthia's story is really just full of holes. Even Harvey Keitel doesn't make it seem interesting and neither does any of Demi Moore's forced reactions of confusion and guilt and sorrow. If the interrogation part had been much stronger, perhaps we would've been forced to take more interest in the general flashback. But the entire story is just too dull to muster that kind of support. On the other hand, the movie doesn't totally leave you hanging. The story does start to get good once Cynthia and Joyce get involved in this mess and then try one stupid thing after another to keep it quiet. But it just didn't seem like enough (and the story by itself was just too long), especially considering that the interrogation and pointing out Cynthia's contradictions are meant to make this mere drama a real thriller. It just fails to do so, and so you're left with about a half-good thriller which had the potential to be much better. And, when the final twist arrives, it just seemed like a tragic let down, rather than a real shocker. Nothing seemed to properly build up to it.

The interesting thing is that regardless of when you watch a movie, there would often be another one that it would make you recall. In my case, it's Sylvia which I saw very recently. The link is the emotion called jealousy. Manifested in two real-life characters of the opposite sex, jealousy just jump out of the screen at you in both movies, although strangely, it isn't the main subject matter of either.

As Jill, the movie's central character, Claudia Cardinale uses her expressive face to provide the perfect landscape for Leone's frequent close-ups.

No, wait a minute, I'm serious. He was in some damn fine action flicks, movies which in many ways helped establish the popular culture of the 1980s and early 1990s. He has a body of work now, with a primitive beginning of Cannon cheapos and the first Terminator, a fruitful and successful middle period (including this film, T2, and 'True Lies,') and a kind of flabby but still energetic late period. What's it all about?The problem is Arnold was never much of an actor, and even though he did get better, exuding real charm and some humanity as he went along, he was never going to be John Wayne in The Searchers, or even Charles Bronson in Death Wish. Total Recall shows much of the limitations of his performance, like poor diction, unconvincing heartfelt dialogue (C'mon Cohagen, give dese people AIR always cracks me up) and a wooden over-reliance on his brawny image. His wisecracks are hit-and-miss, like Roger Moore's in the 007 series, only Roger kind of knew when he had a real groaner and played it for what it was worth with those eyebrows of his. Arnold delivers lines like You think this is the real Quaid? It is! like he thinks he's Noel Coward with an Uzi.I go along with much of what the previous poster from Saffron Walden U.K. said, but I don't think Schwarzenegger was quite as bad as that. He did have a definite something to offer, and when he wasn't required to project too much, he could deliver, at least until he started demonstrating real flair and subtlety with True Lies and Last Action Hero. Here, he isn't quite there yet.None of the acting in this movie is great. Ronny Cox looms over the proceedings like Olivier despite his one-note bad guy simply because the rest of the cast, especially Mel Johnson Jr. as the cabbie Benny but also Rachel Ticotin as Melina and Sharon Stone as Lori, are so obviously uncomfortable in the relatively undemanding roles they are given. Michael Ironside I'll give a pass to, he has presence, but I'd be much more impressed if I saw him portray a social worker for once, or St. Francis.But Cox is good, and has some juicy lines, especially when he tells Melina she'll be reprogrammed to become what every woman should be. That's funny and menacing work. 'I'll be home in time for Corn Flakes,' too. I don't know how he figured on that, but at least here's one screen villain with an appreciation for a well-balanced breakfast.Also, the script is quite clever, and worth likening to The Game and Momento in the way it plays with reality and perception, by characters and audience alike. Like those films, it's somewhat handicapped by a lack of heart, but it's an engaging mindtrip when you ponder to think of the three different hypotheses it offers.Slight spoiler alert People differ strongly on whether Quaid is experiencing the real thing or a botched memory implant that ends with a terminal lobotomy, but it could also be simply that the program worked as advertised and Quaid is on the verge of safely waking up at the end of the film. That scenario has logic problems, of course, as do the other two, but at least this third possibility comes with the silver lining that no one is really ever hurt in the entire movie. End of spoiler alert.The mixed bag of Total Recall continues with the special effects. There are some amazing shots of the characters' faces as they run out of breathable air (done with puppets, not CGI), and clever visual cuts like the blood-drenched computer screen that turns into a Martian landscape. But the sets are dreary, claustrophobic, and full of cheesy '80s neon. The mutants when we see them, especially the sad Yoda-wannabe Kuato, are from hunger. Comparing this to that other Philip K. Dick adaptation, Blade Runner, shows how less-advanced FX can be more than made up for by a director with depth in vision. I for one don't see much of an improvement here over The Running Man, which Schwarzenegger made three years before.What was amazing about this film, and still is now, is the rapid-fire pacing, the way the violence and gore mount with comic timing and at the same time carry the story breathlessly from one plot point to another. I remember seeing this in the theaters in 1990, and how people were exiting shaking their heads and smiling in amazement at what they just witnessed, the pure adrenaline rush it had given them. It still delivers on that count, and it's got that clever story arc besides. Even if you accept what happens here at face value, it offers up some brilliant twists, like the revelation of Quaid's true identity and Lori's part in Cohagen's scheme. Good films often work on multiple levels, and Total Recall is a good film in that respect.So while I'm not wild about this one, I respect it. I like Arnold's choice in scripts.

He has a body of work now, with a primitive beginning of Cannon cheapos and the first Terminator, a fruitful and successful middle period (including this film, T2, and 'True Lies,') and a kind of flabby but still energetic late period. What's it all about?The problem is Arnold was never much of an actor, and even though he did get better, exuding real charm and some humanity as he went along, he was never going to be John Wayne in The Searchers, or even Charles Bronson in Death Wish. Total Recall shows much of the limitations of his performance, like poor diction, unconvincing heartfelt dialogue (C'mon Cohagen, give dese people AIR always cracks me up) and a wooden over-reliance on his brawny image. His wisecracks are hit-and-miss, like Roger Moore's in the 007 series, only Roger kind of knew when he had a real groaner and played it for what it was worth with those eyebrows of his. Arnold delivers lines like You think this is the real Quaid? It is! like he thinks he's Noel Coward with an Uzi.I go along with much of what the previous poster from Saffron Walden U.K. said, but I don't think Schwarzenegger was quite as bad as that. He did have a definite something to offer, and when he wasn't required to project too much, he could deliver, at least until he started demonstrating real flair and subtlety with True Lies and Last Action Hero. Here, he isn't quite there yet.None of the acting in this movie is great. Ronny Cox looms over the proceedings like Olivier despite his one-note bad guy simply because the rest of the cast, especially Mel Johnson Jr. as the cabbie Benny but also Rachel Ticotin as Melina and Sharon Stone as Lori, are so obviously uncomfortable in the relatively undemanding roles they are given. Michael Ironside I'll give a pass to, he has presence, but I'd be much more impressed if I saw him portray a social worker for once, or St. Francis.But Cox is good, and has some juicy lines, especially when he tells Melina she'll be reprogrammed to become what every woman should be. That's funny and menacing work. 'I'll be home in time for Corn Flakes,' too. I don't know how he figured on that, but at least here's one screen villain with an appreciation for a well-balanced breakfast.Also, the script is quite clever, and worth likening to The Game and Momento in the way it plays with reality and perception, by characters and audience alike. Like those films, it's somewhat handicapped by a lack of heart, but it's an engaging mindtrip when you ponder to think of the three different hypotheses it offers.Slight spoiler alert People differ strongly on whether Quaid is experiencing the real thing or a botched memory implant that ends with a terminal lobotomy, but it could also be simply that the program worked as advertised and Quaid is on the verge of safely waking up at the end of the film. That scenario has logic problems, of course, as do the other two, but at least this third possibility comes with the silver lining that no one is really ever hurt in the entire movie. End of spoiler alert.The mixed bag of Total Recall continues with the special effects. There are some amazing shots of the characters' faces as they run out of breathable air (done with puppets, not CGI), and clever visual cuts like the blood-drenched computer screen that turns into a Martian landscape. But the sets are dreary, claustrophobic, and full of cheesy '80s neon. The mutants when we see them, especially the sad Yoda-wannabe Kuato, are from hunger. Comparing this to that other Philip K. Dick adaptation, Blade Runner, shows how less-advanced FX can be more than made up for by a director with depth in vision. I for one don't see much of an improvement here over The Running Man, which Schwarzenegger made three years before.What was amazing about this film, and still is now, is the rapid-fire pacing, the way the violence and gore mount with comic timing and at the same time carry the story breathlessly from one plot point to another. I remember seeing this in the theaters in 1990, and how people were exiting shaking their heads and smiling in amazement at what they just witnessed, the pure adrenaline rush it had given them. It still delivers on that count, and it's got that clever story arc besides. Even if you accept what happens here at face value, it offers up some brilliant twists, like the revelation of Quaid's true identity and Lori's part in Cohagen's scheme. Good films often work on multiple levels, and Total Recall is a good film in that respect.So while I'm not wild about this one, I respect it. I like Arnold's choice in scripts. I just wish his acting skills at that time had caught up with his tastes.

As with any great movie, it is a product that geometrically multiplies the visions and talents of its Director (Norman Jewison) by combining and extracting the best of the talents of his cast together with his technical crew members. As a written play, Fiddler On The Roof, was based on a script that was a true labor of love attempting to extract the best pearls of wit and wisdom from the remarkably rich legacy of humorist-essayist-philosopher Sholom Alechem. The superb musical play was heavy on wit and magnificently composed and choreographed musical numbers capturing-to-a-tee Alechem's spirit and indomitable drollery.  It had steep roots in the Yiddish theater and a perfect musical-comedy farceur to capture that spirit in Zero Mostel.Four years after winning the Oscar for the magnificent In The Heat of The Night, Norman Jewison, a Canadian Christian, had the gall (in many eyes) to attempt to extract still more from his movie.  Rather than embrace the play's Yiddish theater roots, Jewison's movie is more about using Alechem's anecdotes and the brilliant music to capture the essence of the Russian town that Anatevka was at the turn of the century, replete with its distinctly rich Eastern European roots.  In order to do this, he made the bold, albeit unpopular choice, of eschewing Mostel and his New York roots for 33-years-young Israeli actor Chaim Topol who was a smash in the role on London's West End.  This still-controversial choice turned many off and distracted from the movie itself.  This is a pity because I found Topol's performance astounding and at the core of what I personally consider the strongest and deepest movie musical ever made.At its core, the movie version of Fiddler On The Roof focuses on the story of Anatevka first, using the trials and tribulations of Teyve the milkman and his family saga as a mirror to capture what is happening to the town, and as one of the characters notes to Jewish villages like it all over Russia.  As such, this is the story of the unconquerable faith and basic dignity and humility of Job, extended not just to Teyve, not just to Anatevka, but to all the Russian Jews of that era who were forced to flee the homes they loved.  Jewison captures the core and the essential truths of that unconquerable faith coupled with the overwhelming dignity demonstrated by these survivors continuing to smile and persist in humble faith even as their oppressors try to kick their teeth in.To me, one of the most illustrative exchanges is when Motel (Teyve's eldest son-in-law) reflects, We always wait for the Messiah.  Wouldn't this be the perfect time for him to come?  Sympathetically but bemusedly, the Rabbi replies, Of course we shall continue to wait for the Messiah.  We will just have to wait for him somewhere else! All at once, the drama, wit, irony, pathos, faith and essential spirit of Teyve's family and the village leave its indelible imprint on our brains.  Jewison not only captures genuinely and unforgettably all the emotions and essential truths of Anatevka and the 3,000-year legacy it embodies, but creates a vital new legacy as its now inseparable companion.  Yet, at the same time that the heartwrenching story of the oppression and exile of the Jews is evoked, and the indomitable spirit that keeps the culture and religion going is reinforced yet again, it is brought forth in a manner that allows non-Jews to share in the emotions and spirit as well.Since I've given such a long review to a movie and story of great length already and have barely touched upon its many specific gems, I'll endeavor to be brief.  Norma Crane, Rosalind Harris, Leonard Frey, Paul Mann, Louis Zorich (later of Brooklyn Bridge), the female actor playing Chava, the Greek Chorus of Jewish townspeople Zev Schooler, and Molly Picon (the last two being Jewison's concession to the plays Yiddish theater roots) are all outstanding and unforgettable in their roles. The score (yes three good songs were necessarily omitted -- how much longer than 3 hours would you like the movie to run?) is beautifully sung and played, with the instrumentals simply stunning.  The choreography on the Bottle Dance is a standout.  The art direction, sound editing, camera angles, stunning photography, contrasts, virtually every technical aspect of the movie I can name -- and I mean EVERY one -- is magnificently executed to augment Jewison's vision to perfection.As nothing is 100% perfect, I'll pick two minor nits -- unlike others, I thought Glaser missed the essence of Perchik's scholarly radical by half-an-octave and I thought the beautiful and talented Michele Marsh did not look physically like she belonged in that family.  There I said it.  OK, big deal, they were still more than good enough.   I generally loathe movies of more than two-and-one-half hours in length. Fiddler On The Roof and A Man For All Seasons are my two most notable exceptions.  If you enjoy movies made before 1980 at all, and have any sense of the essential spirit of mankind and what the human race is about, you owe it to yourself to see this extraordinary opus -- a true masterpiece that only adds to its relevance with the passage of time. 11\/10.

The atmosphere is amazing. It's not like the bullsh** they try to pass off as horror movies these days. It is actually scary. You see, the reason it is distinguished from most other slashers is because like black Christmas, it relies on atmosphere and suspense, rather than blood and fake intestines getting ripped out(just for the record, I am a fan of zombie flicks, especially ones from the infamous Romero, but intestines is good for zombie flicks, not so much slashers), you do see knives going into people but it is in the dark and shadows, which makes the movie that much more scary and Michael Myers much more threatening, unlike in the crappy sequels, where he just walks around in the light and kill people, tons of blood and gore, typical slasher, which i have no problem with, i love sleepawa camp and Friday the 13th and silent night, deadly night, but halloween is one movie that should not have blood in it. Avoid the sequels at all costs. Trust me, if you watch the first one and stop there, you will not want to leave your room and you will want to carry a weapon everywhere you go, and be looking into all of the shadows, but if you watch the sequels, its like, the scare factor, even for the first one, goes down(which is why the sh** sequels should all be avoided. If you are the type of person like I used to be who thinks you have to have every movie in the series to have the best collection, trust me, you get a much better effect if you just watch the first one. John Carpenter is the only person who has any business directing halloween, and halloween is such a perfect, flawless masterpiece that it needs no sequels, so yeah, that's right, all you talentless directors who tried to ruin halloween(dwight little, rick rosenthal, that french dude, and more)please do everyone a favor a f**k off. You are doing the series more harm than anything else. Also, Moustapha Akkad, please, just stop. Please. Just ignore the sequels, please, I cannot stress this enough, just please, if you love halloween as much as I do, avoid the crappy sequels. Please, you will be a better horror adict(which I am definitely one) if you just watch the first. The sequels are not even scary, Myers just walks around and stabs people with scissors, no suspense, just him walking around, you can always see him. There is no shadow, suspense, atmosphere, or POV that makes the original a masterpiece of horror. If you are thinking about watching the sequels, just don't. It makes every character in the movie seem less likable and, just go watch Black Christmas or The Funhouse, two other great slashers. Here is a list of directors and some movies that will help guide you to create a great horror collection. Tobe Hooper Eaten Alive The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The FunhouseJohn Carpenter Halloween(of course) Christine The FogWes Craven The Hills Have Eyes A Nightmare on Elm street(avoid most sequels, the first 3 are great, though Wes had no part in 2) Last House on the LeftBob Clarke Black ChristmasThere are many other great movies out there, such as Happy Birthday to Me, Terror Train, etc., that are worth checking out. You just have to look, read a lot of reviews to get a good sense of a movie, so you know if it is a repeater, like halloween. There are some movies that are pretty scary, but not enough to have nightmares and stuff. They are mostly just fun to watch. Some are Uncle Sam, Jack Frost(please avoid part 2), Friday the 13th, pretty much all of those 80's slasher gems. Oh yeah, one last note, Carrie is VERY scary, and is definitely worth picking up, or at least renting. Okay, away with me, have fun watching 70's, 80's gold.

You see, the reason it is distinguished from most other slashers is because like black Christmas, it relies on atmosphere and suspense, rather than blood and fake intestines getting ripped out(just for the record, I am a fan of zombie flicks, especially ones from the infamous Romero, but intestines is good for zombie flicks, not so much slashers), you do see knives going into people but it is in the dark and shadows, which makes the movie that much more scary and Michael Myers much more threatening, unlike in the crappy sequels, where he just walks around in the light and kill people, tons of blood and gore, typical slasher, which i have no problem with, i love sleepawa camp and Friday the 13th and silent night, deadly night, but halloween is one movie that should not have blood in it. Avoid the sequels at all costs. Trust me, if you watch the first one and stop there, you will not want to leave your room and you will want to carry a weapon everywhere you go, and be looking into all of the shadows, but if you watch the sequels, its like, the scare factor, even for the first one, goes down(which is why the sh** sequels should all be avoided. If you are the type of person like I used to be who thinks you have to have every movie in the series to have the best collection, trust me, you get a much better effect if you just watch the first one. John Carpenter is the only person who has any business directing halloween, and halloween is such a perfect, flawless masterpiece that it needs no sequels, so yeah, that's right, all you talentless directors who tried to ruin halloween(dwight little, rick rosenthal, that french dude, and more)please do everyone a favor a f**k off. You are doing the series more harm than anything else. Also, Moustapha Akkad, please, just stop. Please. Just ignore the sequels, please, I cannot stress this enough, just please, if you love halloween as much as I do, avoid the crappy sequels. Please, you will be a better horror adict(which I am definitely one) if you just watch the first. The sequels are not even scary, Myers just walks around and stabs people with scissors, no suspense, just him walking around, you can always see him. There is no shadow, suspense, atmosphere, or POV that makes the original a masterpiece of horror. If you are thinking about watching the sequels, just don't. It makes every character in the movie seem less likable and, just go watch Black Christmas or The Funhouse, two other great slashers. Here is a list of directors and some movies that will help guide you to create a great horror collection. Tobe Hooper Eaten Alive The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The FunhouseJohn Carpenter Halloween(of course) Christine The FogWes Craven The Hills Have Eyes A Nightmare on Elm street(avoid most sequels, the first 3 are great, though Wes had no part in 2) Last House on the LeftBob Clarke Black ChristmasThere are many other great movies out there, such as Happy Birthday to Me, Terror Train, etc., that are worth checking out. You just have to look, read a lot of reviews to get a good sense of a movie, so you know if it is a repeater, like halloween. There are some movies that are pretty scary, but not enough to have nightmares and stuff. They are mostly just fun to watch. Some are Uncle Sam, Jack Frost(please avoid part 2), Friday the 13th, pretty much all of those 80's slasher gems. Oh yeah, one last note, Carrie is VERY scary, and is definitely worth picking up, or at least renting. Okay, away with me, have fun watching 70's, 80's gold.

But it's also very enjoyable.Hitchcock always began with substance and let his work evolve into style. With DePalma, it is exactly the opposite he builds upon style and the plot follows. During a sequence of shots that lasts at least ten minutes long, a troubled woman named Kate (Angie Dickinson) chases an unknown man through a museum of art. These scenes are handled with deliberate style -- music overlaps the actions. All other sounds are blocked. Images are slowed down. A hand-held camera takes on the first-person perspective as it swoops around corners, chasing the man as he escapes her...Right when we think we know where the film is headed, it spins us around. After an extra-marital affair with this mysterious man, a vague woman slaughters Kate in an elevator. The lone witness to the crime is Liz Blake (Nancy Allen), one of those hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold characters, who soon finds her own life threatened after the mysterious woman begins to stalk her. Why? Apparently, to taunt Dr. Elliott (Michael Caine), a psychiatrist who realizes that the murder suspect is a patient of his named Bobby. Bobby is a transsexual who has some very serious problems, and apparently no clear motive behind his actions.Kate was also a patient of Dr. Elliott's, prior to her death. Elliot considers this to be the link to the motive. As he tries to convince authorities of Bobby's guilt, Liz decides to do some investigating of her own, with the help of Kate's son.The movie is all about style -- stylish chase sequences, stylish murder sequences, stylish revelation sequences, and stylish dream sequences. It also deals extensively with sex. There are a few scenes in this movie I don't even think Hitchcock would have been daring enough to put into a film.For the most part it's all very enjoyable. Even though I guessed the ending as soon as the murder occurred, getting there was half the fun. The other half owes its success to the style of the movie. Dressed to Kill shocked audiences when it came out for a number of obvious reasons. It dealt rather explicitly with sex, transsexuals and murder. But one of the biggest surprises was the demise of Dickinson's character. Advertised as a main star, she is killed off within the first forty minutes, right after DePalma masterfully convinces us that the story isn't going to be about murder at all. Our minds start to wander, unsure what the film is trying to say. And then the mysterious woman appears with the razor blade and it all starts to make sense.In this regard Dressed to Kill is a masterpiece -- a movie that shocks us at every turn, even when we have a feeling we know where it's going.However, its biggest flaw is its climax Hitchcock knew when to end his movies, and DePalma doesn't. He never really has, although his two finest movies -- Scarface and The Untouchables -- are ironically not Hitchcockian in approach at all. The ending lowers the film's lasting impact because it is so manipulative and unpleasing -- first, there's the mandatory explanation of events. Hitchcock did this with Psycho (1960) and it is often considered one of the film's only faults. Here, DePalma -- who also wrote the script (heavily influenced by Psycho) -- does the same, with even worse dialogue. There's also the overused Dream Sequence effect that should have never been filmed.But all that doesn't really matter in the long run. The style of Dressed to Kill is ultimately what makes it so fun. You may recognize some distinct sequences here that exist in other films (the split-frame sequence is in Kill Bill Vol. 1, for example). In mimicking Hitchcock, DePalma has created a handful of unique styles along the way. Although it isn't flawless, Dressed to Kill is a very fun movie and a must-see for film buffs.

The lone witness to the crime is Liz Blake (Nancy Allen), one of those hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold characters, who soon finds her own life threatened after the mysterious woman begins to stalk her. Why? Apparently, to taunt Dr. Elliott (Michael Caine), a psychiatrist who realizes that the murder suspect is a patient of his named Bobby. Bobby is a transsexual who has some very serious problems, and apparently no clear motive behind his actions.Kate was also a patient of Dr. Elliott's, prior to her death. Elliot considers this to be the link to the motive. As he tries to convince authorities of Bobby's guilt, Liz decides to do some investigating of her own, with the help of Kate's son.The movie is all about style -- stylish chase sequences, stylish murder sequences, stylish revelation sequences, and stylish dream sequences. It also deals extensively with sex. There are a few scenes in this movie I don't even think Hitchcock would have been daring enough to put into a film.For the most part it's all very enjoyable. Even though I guessed the ending as soon as the murder occurred, getting there was half the fun. The other half owes its success to the style of the movie. Dressed to Kill shocked audiences when it came out for a number of obvious reasons. It dealt rather explicitly with sex, transsexuals and murder. But one of the biggest surprises was the demise of Dickinson's character. Advertised as a main star, she is killed off within the first forty minutes, right after DePalma masterfully convinces us that the story isn't going to be about murder at all. Our minds start to wander, unsure what the film is trying to say. And then the mysterious woman appears with the razor blade and it all starts to make sense.In this regard Dressed to Kill is a masterpiece -- a movie that shocks us at every turn, even when we have a feeling we know where it's going.However, its biggest flaw is its climax Hitchcock knew when to end his movies, and DePalma doesn't. He never really has, although his two finest movies -- Scarface and The Untouchables -- are ironically not Hitchcockian in approach at all. The ending lowers the film's lasting impact because it is so manipulative and unpleasing -- first, there's the mandatory explanation of events. Hitchcock did this with Psycho (1960) and it is often considered one of the film's only faults. Here, DePalma -- who also wrote the script (heavily influenced by Psycho) -- does the same, with even worse dialogue. There's also the overused Dream Sequence effect that should have never been filmed.But all that doesn't really matter in the long run. The style of Dressed to Kill is ultimately what makes it so fun. You may recognize some distinct sequences here that exist in other films (the split-frame sequence is in Kill Bill Vol. 1, for example). In mimicking Hitchcock, DePalma has created a handful of unique styles along the way. Although it isn't flawless, Dressed to Kill is a very fun movie and a must-see for film buffs.
