It also provides a finely textured portrait of its wartime, small town Mississippi setting. Based upon the memoirs of writer Willie Morris, `My Dog Skip' stars the wonderful child actor Frankie Muniz (the delightful star of TV's `Malcolm in the Middle') as a friendless nine-year-old misfit whose mother buys him a puppy for his birthday to help assuage his loneliness.  More fond of reading than of football, young Willie becomes the hapless target of the town bullies and Skip provides him with just the right note of friendship to help him through his trying times.  The cast of characters also includes Willie's well meaning but overprotective war hero father (sensitively played by Kevin Bacon), his loving and supportive mother (the fine actress Diane Lane), the boy-next-door town hero (Luke Wilson) who turns out to be less than one on the battlefield, and a band of moon shiners who figure into the climactic activities of the film's final half.`My Dog Skip' is less noteworthy for its plotting &#150; which often seems forced, obvious and melodramatic &#150; than for its overall tone of laid back charm.  Muniz in particular brings such an aura of subtle naturalism to his role as Willie that we easily overlook the film's overall lack of originality.  Actually, the fact that Willie seems like such a likeable regular kind of a kid undercuts the film's credibility a little.  We find it hard to believe that he would really be such an outcast from his peers.  The writer, Gail Gilchriest, and director, Jay Russell, manage to keep the sentimentality down to a minimum, though the film does get a bit goopy once in a while.  The moonshining subplot seems especially weak and unconvincing, a pale but underdeveloped echo of `Huck Finn,' a book Morris obviously worshipped as a child (we see him receiving a hardbound copy of it for his birthday).  On the positive side, the filmmakers resist the temptation to gussy up the narrative with either highbrow humanitarian messages (though the narration does become a bit portentous at times) or insulting lowbrow comic slapstick.  The issue of race relations is dealt with in somewhat glossy and unrealistic terms, but that is probably the appropriate choice for a film aimed at such a young audience.  `My Dog Skip' needs to be viewed on two levels &#150; as a beautifully acted but unsurprising version of a tale adults have seen countless times before &#150; and as a sweet, heartwarming and edifying film for young children who will be able to identify with many of the simple themes found in the narrative.

It is also the one that has been remade the most number of times &#150; in 1959 and again in 1978.  It is loosely based on the novel of the same name by John Buchan, who, incidentally, became Governor General of Canada under the title of Lord Tweedsmuir the very year the film was released.The plot will be familiar even to Hitchcock fans who happened to miss this movie.  A visiting Canadian, played by Donat, is falsely accused of the murder of a beautiful spy who had sought refuge in his London flat.  Like Cary Grant a quarter-century later in North by Northwest, he is forced to flee both the law and an international spy ring, heading north to Scotland to seek out a man missing part of his little finger who turns out to be the ringleader.  While fleeing south again he is kidnapped and handcuffed to Carroll and, naturally enough for a Hitchcock film, an initial friction between the two eventually blossoms into romance as she is increasingly persuaded of his innocence.  The action is fast-paced and there are some wonderfully amusing scenes.  My favourite found Donat accidentally thrust onto the platform of a by-election campaign rally and forced to improvise a political speech as if he himself were introducing the candidate.  The humour lies in his actually pulling it off to the audience's satisfaction and applause!There are a few scenes of a sexually suggestive nature that probably would not have appeared in an American film at that time, although they might have only two years earlier before the adoption of the Hayes Code.  One has Donat and Carroll checking into a small hotel together, with the proprietors uncertain whether or not they are married.  Another is a closeup of Carroll removing her stockings while handcuffed to Donat.Virtually everyone notes the appearance in two brief scenes of a very young Peggy Ashcroft, the famous Shakespearean actress.  I myself didn't like these scenes.  Although Hitchcock was a Roman Catholic, he was apparently not above stereotyping the man of faith (John Laurie) as a dour, humourless wife-beater whose one positive contribution is a bullet-stopping hymnbook!  I can't help wondering whether C. S. Lewis or G. K. Chesterton saw the film and, if so, what they would have thought of such a one-sided portrayal.Three more flaws keep this from being a masterpiece.

What a waste of time and money, but it will still be a big box-office success, and a movie which sells itself, despite its sloppy execution. Hannibal is an utterly inept movie, perhaps more so to readers of Harris novel. The book was a real page-turner, cleverly plotted and impressively constructed. The screenplay, however, while with a pretty clever new ending, rushes through several important scenes, abandons some dramatic set-pieces which would have been great, and re-constructs some subplots so that they completely loose their dramatic potential. There is also a brief scene which is in direct contradiction to events described in Silence of the lambs. What remains is a movie which is sketchy, un-atmospheric, undramatic, devoid of characterization and is always effective in reminding us that were only watching a movie, due to the fact that it's style is reminiscent of an extended rock video. It serves only to push the viewer OUT of the movie. Do we need the incessant, boring music on every scene? Do we really need the supposedly scary ambient sounds to underline the fact that Lecter is an evil dude? Do we need to have plot twists signalled way too early and loud? Do we need this movie?

It mixes quirky, realistic conversational comedy with crooks and guns in a way that you might think rings bells of Pulp Fiction or the more recent Snatch (also with Pitt), but doesn't. It's mostly a relationship movie, focusing on those couples who love hard. Jerry (Brad Pitt) and Sam (Julia Roberts) just can't get it together, even though they're deeply in love. Should they call it off, or keep trying? The Mexican tries to answer that question. (very mild spoilers ahead) The rest of the film is made up of a very involved story about an antique pistol called the Mexican. Jerry has to get the gun for a gangster that he sort of owes.  Sam is infuriated that he has cancelled their Vegas trip, and explodes when he tells her he has to go to Mexico.  We follow him there and her to Vegas, where she is kidnapped by a hitman named Leroy (The Sopranos's James Gandolfini).  That opens up into an entirely different plot and a character as interesting as the leads, who are incredibly interesting themselves.And it's a good thing they were willing to take pay cuts to star in this film.  If they hadn't, I fear it wouldn't reach an audience, and be filed away into obscurity with four copies at Blockbuster.  But because it's backed by the heavyweights (Roberts may be the biggest star in the world), it will be seen, and I think, enjoyed.  The two leads are at their very best, and Roberts in particular shows incredible range.  Her performance here dwarfs her work on Erin Brockovich. Pitt absolutely proves that he's simply one of the best actors working, with or without the looks (which I, of course, don't notice).  He is all about charisma, and it shines through in Jerry, an extremely unique character who lets Pitt's ingenuity run wild. James Gandolfini may play another gangster here, but he's miles away from Tony Soprano.  He has a great screen presence and, again, the film showcases his incredible range.The situations that the characters find themselves in are equal parts horrible and hilarious.  The little tidbits of reality that are thrown into the extravagant plot bring it down to earth and leave the audience saying that doesn't happen in movies. That's why the Mexican is so special.  It doesn't care that it's a movie. Wild, funny, crazy, awful stuff keeps happening, and we just keep experiencing it.  One scene that I won't spoil involves the meeting of Pitt and Gandolfini, and it startled me, and made me want to thank the filmmakers for developing ALL of its characters, and making an interesting scene out of what a lesser film would have made mundane.See The Mexican because it's got your favorite stars in great roles; see it because you've probably never seen anything like it before; and see it because it's really, really fun.

Violence has consequences on you... you don't just get punched in the face and then you're back to normal after 20 minutes. Yes, it's unsettling, but nothing is gratuitous.Much less I understand how some big people deliberately missed the point by calling this movie dangerous or fascist. The revolution we see in the movie is much closer to the anarchist sabotages during the 18-hundreds, and the reasons are the same. They movie doesn't tell you that sabotages are right, but it shows you the reasons that led to that kind of behaviour. What we see here is criticism at our society's faults, and the film hardly advocates terrorism; yes, unlike American Beauty, it is stretched to extreme consequences, and that's exactly the point we HAVE to avoid a society ruled only by capitalism and money, because in such a place we are bound to lose our soul. You can think of American Beauty a hand that points a finger at our society's cr*p from the distance, and you can think of Fight Club as a hand that makes you see the cr*ap by smashing your face in it.
