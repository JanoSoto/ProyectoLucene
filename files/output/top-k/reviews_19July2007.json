She has no religious beliefs and doesn't believe in any sort of god... but she soon begins to question this when she begins to show signs of stigmata, which are manifestations of the wounds of Christ. A Catholic priest, Father Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) is assigned from the Vatican to look into Frankie's wounds, and believes he has a legit case of the supernatural phenomena. But Frankie's episodes become more and more violent, and Father Kiernan begins to wonder if Frankie might be possessed by someone, or something, that is linked to the time of Christ.A rather frightening horror film that brings many questions of the Catholic church to the surface, Stigmata is a fairly good movie. Some may look at it and immediately think Exorcist rip-off (which is a bit understandable), but this film isn't merely that. While it revolves around religious themes, the entire stigmata phenomenon is a topic that hasn't been brought about in cinema, and it really is an interesting thing, whether you believe in it or not. These religious-themed horror movies often bring about a lot of controversy (many of it from radical Christians), but the thing is, this movie, like many others with similar themes, aren't necessarily attacking the church. They may be questioning things, but what's wrong with that? This film doesn't try and force you to believe one way or the other - it just tells the story of a woman with no religious belief who finds herself experiencing something that may be supernatural. Anyhow, the writing here is pretty solid and the idea is translated on-screen well. The storytelling becomes a tad bit choppy on a few occasions and there are a few plot holes that could have been easily taken care of, but aside from these few moments, the story flows pretty well. Since I often find supernatural horror movies much scarier than your run-of-the-mill slasher flicks (I believe it's just the mysticism and ominousness of it all), there were quite a few moments in this film that irked me quite a bit. Frankie's possession scenes and her episodes are done very well, and the dark imagery and use of color really add to the movie's overall creepiness. It's a dark movie, and the mood is perfect, because it really makes you feel uneasy. The filming style and technique is also unique and gives more texture to the movie. Patricia Arquette plays our atheistic lead very well, and conveys her character fittingly. Gabriel Byrne plays the helping priest very well too. The acting overall is very good, and I liked the characters. The movie ends on a more positive note, which was nice.Overall, Stigmata is an interesting movie that has a few problems here and there, but considering the remainder, it's most definitely worth a watch. If you enjoy religious-themed movies of this type, this is pretty good modern-day entry into that small category of movies. It provides some good shocks and an intriguing plot, with some good acting to boot. It's not as bad as some reviewers have made it out to be on here, either. 7\/10.
