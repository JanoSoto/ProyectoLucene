I had seen it countless times when I was younger courtesy of my Geography class and I always thought that I wouldn't bother viewing it again. However, something drew me to it and I ended up viewing Twister again. I can't make any more conclusions besides the ones I had already drawn from previous viewings and I know that this movie has been criticized for an over-reliance on effects and a lacking of substance. I'd mostly agree to this, but I don't really see any enormous issues in it. It's merely designed to be a piece of fun and that it certainly is.The story goes as follows. Bill Harding is a TV Weatherman looking for his distant wife, Jo with the intention of having her sign divorce papers so he can marry his girlfriend, Melissa. Upon meeting with her, he is caught up in an investigation of a series of tornadoes across the state of Oklahoma involving revolutionary equipment that is being used to study tornadoes in a way that has never been possible. The movie then explores a series of violent tornadoes as well as the realization that Bill and Jo have about their relationship.Even though the film was made in 1996 and they may be regarded as outdated by today's standards, I think that the special effects in Twister are wonderful. It is true that there is an over-reliance on them and they certainly do get in the way of plot however I do admit that they were indeed really fun to watch and the action scenes never really felt drawn out to me (a mistake that seems to be very common in poorer action films).The acting is alright. Bill Paxton's performance is rather flat. Helen Hunt I feel did a good job and her character, Jo is certainly the most fleshed out character in the movie. Jamie Gertz was fine as Melissa, but the character has very little purpose and it wouldn't make a huge difference if she was cut out altogether. Cary Elwes' performance as Jonas isn't too great as his accent isn't very strong and its hard to indicate what specific accent he's trying to put on. It sounds very Southern, but there's a mixture of something else in there. Besides these, who couldn't love the irritating yet entertaining character, Dusty, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. The guy is so unusual and the reasons for his apeish behaviour is totally unexplained, but what can I say? He's great comedic relief.This film has been heavily criticized for its lack of character and story development as well as an over-reliance on special effects being the only reason it was such a huge hit back in 1996. These complaints are indeed true, but I feel that people overestimated what the film would be like based on the budget and hence came out disappointed. People need to learn to not believe the hype when it comes to profits. They are no indicator for quality. Despite this, it's still a really fun movie.Twister isn't perfect and is faulted, sometimes greatly so. However it does pass as a nice piece of action filmmaking that you'd enjoy for 100 minutes provided that you lighten up and prepare to just have fun and not expect something stimulating for the brain. It's a great movie and I'm standing by my opinion.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 September 2011","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I'm surprised that I actually did just watch this movie today.

Guthrie finally picks up a guitar and begins to write songs about what he's seeing in hopes that it can change how things are. Hal Ashby's BOUND FOR GLORY is a very slow-paced film that really doesn't appear to be about anything. As with most of Ashby's films, this one here takes its time getting told and if you barely looked at it you'd think that there wasn't anything going on and that there wasn't any life to the film. The movie takes about ten minutes for the viewer really to settle in and from here on it's quite a powerful movie with a classic performance by Carradine, some terrific movie and some truly wonderful images. The cinematography by Haskell Wexler is among some of the best that you're ever going to see and it perfectly blends with Ashby's masterful direction, which really puts you in the time and place that all of this takes place. The beautiful images of Guthrie riding on the top of trains or the work camps where violence often erupts if union is mentioned is perfectly brought to life and you really can't help but feel as if you're watching an actual documentary from the 1930s about the Depression, the Dusk Bowl and this small man who would rise up to do great things. Carradine certainly deserved all the praise he got for his performance because there's not a single moment where you're watching the movie and seeing an actor playing a part. Instead you see Guthrie right up there on the screen doing his thing. Many times actors can't separate themselves when they play a real person but Carradine is so into the character that you really can't help but be amazed. Ronny Cox appears as Ozark Bule, the man who brought Woody into the business and Randy Quaid also has a small role as a picker. As with most bio-pics, you really can't believe everything you're seeing as certain events are going to be changed for a wide range of reasons but that really shouldn't keep anyone from watching the picture. I know many can't stand the slowness that Ashby brought to his films but I think the slow pace actually helps the film because it just seems to fit the times and situations that were going on. At 147-minutes, the film is certainly entertaining from start to finish due to that beautiful cinematography and of course Carradine, the actor and singer.

A junkyard where cars sing about being executed by crushing and dismemberment?I will forever love this movie. It's a great kid's film, but there are plenty of hidden themes for adults if you look closely enough at it. Out of all the Disney movies, I think it's one of the more obscure ones compared to the overly popular ones you always see on lunch boxes, T-shirts, and what not. That's the beauty of it. Any fan of film can easily tell the same writers here would go on to work on the Toy Story series, especially when in comparison with the recent Toy Story 3. The due credit starts right there, but it only continues on with an awesome voice cast. My favorites would definitely be Thurl Ravenscroft as Kirby and Jon Lovitz as The Radio. Each character is pretty distinct, and the story allows each their moment to be a hero.The artwork style has a nice aged look to it, and can be quite menacing at times. In fact, I'd say more often than not the atmosphere and lighting is quite dark. This goes right along with the aforementioned themes, which are prevalent throughout the film; themes of solitude, the need for companionship, which coincide with truly bizarre, cold and heart-breaking scenes. One of the few moments in film history to ever actually draw tears from me is the flower scene. It was strikingly depressing, making one almost subconsciously ask themselves if life without intimacy is worth living at all. Another theme I noticed, and appreciated just as much as if not more, is the very important message of not forsaking the antiquity of life. All of this helped along by a score that is dark, adventurous and mysterious all at once. Done by David Newman , it always heightens the mood of the film. Plus the songs by Van Dyke Parks are really well done and quite catchy. My favorite would definitely be Worthless. I must definitely recommend Brave little Toaster to anyone who wants to experience a truly unique animated film, to me a classic and one of the best of all time.

Any fan of film can easily tell the same writers here would go on to work on the Toy Story series, especially when in comparison with the recent Toy Story 3. The due credit starts right there, but it only continues on with an awesome voice cast. My favorites would definitely be Thurl Ravenscroft as Kirby and Jon Lovitz as The Radio. Each character is pretty distinct, and the story allows each their moment to be a hero.The artwork style has a nice aged look to it, and can be quite menacing at times. In fact, I'd say more often than not the atmosphere and lighting is quite dark. This goes right along with the aforementioned themes, which are prevalent throughout the film; themes of solitude, the need for companionship, which coincide with truly bizarre, cold and heart-breaking scenes. One of the few moments in film history to ever actually draw tears from me is the flower scene. It was strikingly depressing, making one almost subconsciously ask themselves if life without intimacy is worth living at all. Another theme I noticed, and appreciated just as much as if not more, is the very important message of not forsaking the antiquity of life. All of this helped along by a score that is dark, adventurous and mysterious all at once. Done by David Newman , it always heightens the mood of the film. Plus the songs by Van Dyke Parks are really well done and quite catchy. My favorite would definitely be Worthless. I must definitely recommend Brave little Toaster to anyone who wants to experience a truly unique animated film, to me a classic and one of the best of all time.

I really didn't know what to expect exactly &#x85; an introspective film, some kind of intellectual drama essentially trying to capture the existential issues of the titular actor's tormented mind, I didn't think of a fantasy anyway, and certainly didn't anticipate this piece of cinematic creativity and visual awesomeness my mind would endure for less than two hours. Being John Malkovich is not only one of the most creative movies of the last 20 years, but certainly one of the cleverest and most mind-bending and twisted scripts ever concocted from a newcomer, his name is Charlie Kauffman, and this is definitely one of these reviews that must start by a thunder of verbal applauds for the writing.Though the movie is not the most quotable of all, like Network or Chinatown, it features more similarities with scripts à la Rashomon or The Usual Suspects, these intricate puzzles where you have to assemble each piece until the end, but in the case of Being John Malkovich, it's less about a resolution or a revelation than how far a movie can exploit an inventive concept, how long it can hook the audiences' minds with an ingenious plot device. This is why the script is actually closer to movies like Back to the Future and Groundhog Day. And when the plot consists on having people being in someone else's body, let alone John Malkovich, well, besides the thrills, besides the laughs, the movie should feature a necessary level of depth. Indeed, when you have such a goldmine for plot twists, you must handle them carefully and on that level, Charlie Kauffman did it with a remarkable craftsmanship. And even if you expect to be surprised, it's nothing compared to the exhilarating cinematic experience of the first viewing.The symbolism that structures the whole narrative is highlighted during the opening credits where you discover a marvelous puppet's number directed by Greg Schwartz, John Cusack whose appearance immediately labels him in the antihero 'slash' loser category. Greg is so devoured by his own passion that he's totally neglecting his couple. And despite the apparent love between Greg and his wife Lotte, there's the strong feeling that both belong to two different worlds, he works in the basement, taking care of his puppets with the delicacy of a God-like figure caring about his creations, while Lotte, live with her animals on the top, creating a touching mini-zoo in the house. The only similarity between the two is their looks, by the way, only after the first half hour, I realized it was Cameron Diaz below that huge afro. Even though she's not the most feminine cinematic character, she genuinely wants children, but Greg seems reluctant because of his unemployment, which Lotte understands &#x85; the film doesn't waste its time with these two wannabe-anything and quickly gets to the point, when Greg replies to a job offer.Greg's skillful hands get him the job in a peculiar and mysterious 'filling' company set, in the 7th and half floor, probably the lowest roof from any work place. Go figure why Kauffman decided to insert an element that wouldn't have changed much the plot. I guess this is the difference between talented and great directors, the low roof element created a bit of visual jokes to distract us before the third element of the future love triangle makes her entrance, Catherine Keener as Maxine, Greg's ambitious, sexy co-worker, she talks straightforwardly and doesn't embarrass herself with social hypocrisy. For a man who lives with a girl like Lotte, now I understand why Cameron Diaz had to look anything but sexy, he naturally falls in love with the scene-stealing Maxine, but she's not interested. Now, all the pieces are ready and the game can start when Greg accidentally discovers a strange tunnel that leads to John Malkovich's body. Why Malkovich? How does it work? Why fifteen minutes in his body? That's the charm, did you really want to know why the Groundhog Day was repeating itself? I was so delighted by the premise I couldn't wait to see where this would get, until the intelligence's highlight of the film was reached when Lotte was John Malkovich and when what followed set a whole new psychoanalytical mood. The film is not about being John Malkovich, but becoming another person. Greg discovers the ultimate puppetry, as a man who brings life to objects, now he can insufflate life to a human being, dictating his gestures, his thoughts, his sexual impulses, being God in a pervert sort of way. Is his fantasy the sublime allegory of puppetry's beauty or is puppetry the incarnation of a sordid and lusty desire? Maxine doesn't need the experience because she's naturally a controlling woman, and her desire is to control John Malkovich while he's controlled by either Greg or Lotte. And for Lotte, it's the epiphany, the flash of realization that she's not trapped in John Malkovich, but in her own body, discovering finally the sensation of being a man. Lotte loves animals, she loves life, it's all about the sensation of living again, while Greg uses people as objects to satisfy his personal impulses. Maxine is simply torn between these two approaches, which might explain why she appealed to both Greg and Lotte.The movie reveals our deepest fantasies or sexual torments, the desire to be the same person in another body, sometimes from a different sex, to have one person we love in another body &#x85; in both cases it's about the distinction between the mind and the body as a source of discomfort or satisfaction, and John Malkovich's body is the humble setting of a mind-blowing experimentation highlighting our conditions as clumsy puppets directed by our consciences whose strings are pulled by our subconscious or by other persons or by sex, by God, you name them.

It is an honor few films have received, considering only 550 out of the hundreds of thousands of films America has produced since film's birth long ago. This is rightfully so, as the film is a masterpiece on many levels and despite being nearly eighty years old watching it today it still doesn't feel dated at all. Its humor is golden, there being so many classic lines I've heard them quoted so many times in other productions and in everyday life even. Not only that but it was a blue print for future films of a similar genre, the romantic comedy everyone's come to know and love, and its influence is unmistakable as well as undeniable. The film encompasses many aspects of the classic screwball comedy that was prominent in the 30s and 40s. Though elements of the subgenre have survived on for years in modern comedy, the screwball comedy of the early twentieth century represented a specific point in American history. Take for instance Claudette Colbert's character, Ellie. Besides being beautiful, she is intelligent, especially compared to the minor male characters. We see this in the opening scenes and one of our initial reactions may be to think of her as nothing more than a spoiled brat. However, the clever writing uses her somewhat awkward and clumsy nature amongst the everyday people and bus travelers not only as comedy, but as a way to draw sympathy for the character. We soon see that she is alone in her plight, and so arrives the charming Peter Warren, played by Clark Gable. Peter Warren appears and quickly distinguishes himself from the other male characters in that he is not only intelligent, but he's a man of honor and dignity. Not only that, he's street smart and humble compared to Ellie's would be husband. Consider the well-played foil of how Peter is on a simple bus, in sharp contrast to the groom who arrives at his wedding in a plane of all things. It is on the bus where the majority of the character interaction takes place. The two seemingly opposite personalities are brought together by fate, another one of the trademarks of screwball comedy that became a principle of romantic comedy as a whole. Throughout the film, one hears dialogue in rather a series of quips almost, the comedic insults and quirks of the characters. You see this with many of them, but it is strongest with the two star crossed lovers.That is one of the beauties of screwball comedy. This sex comedy without sex achieves its sexual tension without being lewd at all. Despite the lack of today's raunchy style, the dialogue is so rich, and the actors so talented with lines, you can feel the attraction building. Before it even reaches the dénouement, you can hardly notice how much closer the characters have become due to its sublime subtlety. Romantically speaking, the hay scene is the high note, as we finally see the boiling romance between the characters that they previously denied or really had no intention of. But also, and perhaps for memorabilia and sentimental laughs really, would be the hitch-hiking scene. It's not just incredibly hilarious, but Ellie finally proves her worth to Peter who previously had cared for her almost as if she were a helpless damsel. It's brilliant characterization at work. The mise-en-scene of this film is another one of its main attractions. On one level, it represents the social status differences and qualities of the character. In many shots of Ellie's father (Walter Colbert), we see the fine wine and other assorted alcohols. In sharp contrast, the first time we see Peter he's drinking out of a bottle in a telephone booth. The remarkable beauty of the film's artistic mise-en-scene though comes out in its night scenes, especially in the rain. The camera and lighting really illuminates the characters in those scenes. It makes them stand out amongst the others as if they weren't even there. As time goes on, night after night, the two literally and emotionally draw closer to one another. It Happened One Night is a masterpiece on many aspects. It is a classic that represents the birth of a genre and a picture of human emotion. Alas all that, it is a frozen moment in history, giving illusion to a time that has been forgotten by some. Taking all that into account, along with the majestic authenticity of the glorious black-and-white days, it truly stands the test of time.

The mise-en-scene of this film is another one of its main attractions. On one level, it represents the social status differences and qualities of the character. In many shots of Ellie's father (Walter Colbert), we see the fine wine and other assorted alcohols. In sharp contrast, the first time we see Peter he's drinking out of a bottle in a telephone booth. The remarkable beauty of the film's artistic mise-en-scene though comes out in its night scenes, especially in the rain. The camera and lighting really illuminates the characters in those scenes. It makes them stand out amongst the others as if they weren't even there. As time goes on, night after night, the two literally and emotionally draw closer to one another. It Happened One Night is a masterpiece on many aspects. It is a classic that represents the birth of a genre and a picture of human emotion. Alas all that, it is a frozen moment in history, giving illusion to a time that has been forgotten by some. Taking all that into account, along with the majestic authenticity of the glorious black-and-white days, it truly stands the test of time. ","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"19 September 2011","score":"","review":" Director Frank Capra's It Happened One Night (1934) was deemed culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant by the Library of Congress in 1993, and for that it was preserved in the National Film Registry. It is an honor few films have received, considering only 550 out of the hundreds of thousands of films America has produced since film's birth long ago. This is rightfully so, as the film is a masterpiece on many levels and despite being nearly eighty years old watching it today it still doesn't feel dated at all. Its humor is golden, there being so many classic lines I've heard them quoted so many times in other productions and in everyday life even. Not only that but it was a blue print for future films of a similar genre, the romantic comedy everyone's come to know and love, and its influence is unmistakable as well as undeniable. The film encompasses many aspects of the classic screwball comedy that was prominent in the 30s and 40s. Though elements of the subgenre have survived on for years in modern comedy, the screwball comedy of the early twentieth century represented a specific point in American history. Take for instance Claudette Colbert's character, Ellie. Besides being beautiful, she is intelligent, especially compared to the minor male characters. We see this in the opening scenes and one of our initial reactions may be to think of her as nothing more than a spoiled brat. However, the clever writing uses her somewhat awkward and clumsy nature amongst the everyday people and bus travelers not only as comedy, but as a way to draw sympathy for the character. We soon see that she is alone in her plight, and so arrives the charming Peter Warren, played by Clark Gable. Peter Warren appears and quickly distinguishes himself from the other male characters in that he is not only intelligent, but he's a man of honor and dignity. Not only that, he's street smart and humble compared to Ellie's would be husband. Consider the well-played foil of how Peter is on a simple bus, in sharp contrast to the groom who arrives at his wedding in a plane of all things. It is on the bus where the majority of the character interaction takes place. The two seemingly opposite personalities are brought together by fate, another one of the trademarks of screwball comedy that became a principle of romantic comedy as a whole. Throughout the film, one hears dialogue in rather a series of quips almost, the comedic insults and quirks of the characters. You see this with many of them, but it is strongest with the two star crossed lovers.That is one of the beauties of screwball comedy. This sex comedy without sex achieves its sexual tension without being lewd at all. Despite the lack of today's raunchy style, the dialogue is so rich, and the actors so talented with lines, you can feel the attraction building. Before it even reaches the dénouement, you can hardly notice how much closer the characters have become due to its sublime subtlety. Romantically speaking, the hay scene is the high note, as we finally see the boiling romance between the characters that they previously denied or really had no intention of. But also, and perhaps for memorabilia and sentimental laughs really, would be the hitch-hiking scene. It's not just incredibly hilarious, but Ellie finally proves her worth to Peter who previously had cared for her almost as if she were a helpless damsel. It's brilliant characterization at work. The mise-en-scene of this film is another one of its main attractions. On one level, it represents the social status differences and qualities of the character.

This is a coming of age movie, about heart, love and dancing, it's a drama about the clash of social classes, abuse, a reminder of the consequences of prohibiting abortion(women pay a price), a movie about family, jealousy, team spirit and it's filled with nice music and songs. This movie is about beauty and fighting for what you believe is right and what feels right and it's quite touching for something that light and entertaining - it's a feel good movie. Yes, I'm a guy. Swayze shines with his dancing, his smile, his acting. He's very natural and fun to watch. Yet the movie is not so much about him as it is about everything else, he's just a catalyst... it's really about a girl becoming a woman through her love and compassion... it all has a musical quality to it without being a musical.There's no need to go into the details of the story which you will easily figure out when you watch it.

One dedicated his life for silent comedy as a universal language meant to inspire the purest and most human emotions, while the other turned the country of Kant into a supremacist nation, justifying such atrocities as invasions, mass murders and ultimately, genocide. Chaplin was a man of emotions, Hitler of a rationalism whose meaning was twisted until it became synonym of bestial superiority the law of the strongest, or mechanical thinking, through the dedication to technology in total contempt for the emotions that resonate for Nazis as the language of the weak. The Great Dictator is Chaplin's answer to this absurdity, a message that speaks for Humanity universal, inspirational &#x85; and hilarious.One scene incarnates the universality of silent comedy, the 'globe ballet', illustrating with a poetic finesse, the devastating ambitions and the madness inherent not just to Hynkel, but to all the dictators in the world, the balloon popping at the end is the prophetic reminder that justice triumphs sooner or later. The whole film contains many classic Chaplin moments including the iconic shaving with Brahms's Hungarian Violins reminding how Nazism dishonored the beautiful heritage of its civilization, other scenes include the confrontation between Hynkel and Napolini, the dictation, and the inflamed speech in German-sounding gibberish. In City Lights, Chaplin used gibberish to humorously denounce sound's futility, in The Great Dictator, Hynkel's gibberish sounds like barks reminding what Hitler's voices incarnated to the oppressed people, something inhuman, hateful, violent ... still, better to be mocked than wept over.Chaplin's treatment, more than in any of his films, tackles a difficult subject with the perfect mix of comedy and drama, incarnated by Hannah, Paulette Goddard whose illuminating beauty represents the driving force of the film, as the eternal dream on a brighter tomorrow, as the virginal wound in people's devastated hearts. Never losing faith in humanity, Hannah epitomizes Anne Franck's famous In spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart The tender relationship with the Jewish barber demonstrates the evilness of an ideology that prevented people from the simplest things, simply from being human. In the 'coin in the pudding' scene, one of the funniest, we realize that despite all the noblest feelings, the men from the ghetto are just ordinary guys who don't necessarily want to be heroes, a subtle but no less clever depiction of Jewish humor, subtle mix of wit and self-derision.Chaplin said that if he'd known the extent of the atrocities committed by the Nazi, he couldn't have made fun of it. This is a honest and admirable recognition of the value of comedy, it's not a weapon but it attacks, not rational but it makes you think, whatever takes itself too seriously is put in its place and whatever is mocked by the majority gets an extra level of depth and poignancy. This is probably why Chaplin was uneasy with the gap between Hynkel and the 'original' dictator who forever marked the course of history, the comedy is still innocent enough to be regarded as an answer to Nazism's horrific barbarity. Which might explain why a few films made fun of Hitler after The Great Dictator and why most of the comedic takes on Hitler were from Jewish directors, as if one had to carry the wound of the tragedy to translate it into laughs, as a posthumous attempt to strike back against the evil, humor as a defensive, almost cathartic, process &#x85; I guess.I also guess Chaplin believed in that and unconsciously saw himself as one of the oppressed people, whether they were Jewish or Gentle, Black or White, he saw himself as part of humanity. And this is where the universality of The Little Tramp relies on, he's the Little Fellow who speaks for all the little fellows in the world, with thrilling words expressing the very principles Chaplin stood for kindness, love, brotherhood, happiness, universality. It's not the Jewish barber but Chaplin himself delivering the most beautiful and intelligently inspirational message transcending the bounds of Cinema. Chaplin who never spoke, finally let out all his emotions, beliefs and feelings, so important that the fact that he was out of the character, wasn't relevant. The climactic speech rejects the barbarity of Nazism, fascism, any ugly word ending with -ism, rejects machinery that became synonym of alienation and destruction as foreshadowed in his previous Modern Times, and accepts technology only as an instrument to unite people, to strengthen human spirit, solidarity, empathy. Not Tomania, or Bacteria, Chaplin, spoke from the bottom of his heart, a place named Utopia, a beautiful dream, we tend to reach every day. Like a true prophet of his era, Chaplin, ahead of his time, points the danger of Nazism. The applauds at the end indirectly highlights the fantastic aspect of the film, released in 1940 when the worst was to come.But Chaplin made his point and the film works as fantasy with the last metamorphosis of a character, proving that justice can triumph over fanaticism and while other film-makers imagined cold-blooded killers machine-gunning Adolf Hitler with an orgasmic satisfaction, Chaplin appeals to humanity, asks people to think as one indivisible brotherhood, no nations, no frontiers, no use of malicious technologies, only kindness and humble intelligence to put wings in human souls so they can fly to rainbows of hope.Not just Chaplin's ultimate masterpiece, The Great Dictator is one of the most humanistic cinematic message that never lost its resonance, not even after 70 years.

The movie does a very good job with the elements in this type of genre that you grow attach to the characters and has a new feel to it even if it's been done before. The movie was made before I was even born but it's still a good cinematic experience. The movie has some interesting scenarios mainly how it would be like if you put a rebellious smart alek that influences the other patients around him. This movie is simply intriguing from beginning to end. The story and everything flowed very well and how the main protagonist slowly start to breakdown the system was entertaining and yet uplifting like some reviewers claim it to be. Oh and Jack Nicholson is really good in this and pulls off his role really well. And I liked his character in this, because although he isn't a good person but he has a bit of kindness to him in this, even if there is a chance he might be crazy.

Aged Donald Pleasence does his best with the material he's been given and plays the retired doctor Loomis superbly despite his age and weakened voice he still steals every scene. Actress Marianne Hagan's Kara Strode is slightly wasted, fleeting in and out like her son Danny and many of the other characters. George P. Wilbur (who played Michael in Revenge) returns once again as The Shape with good screen presence and movement.Anyone unfamiliar with the series may have a difficult time following the unnecessary convoluted story. The screenplay hints at a town moving on but doesn't build on the theme, nor expand on Michael coming home. It has some interesting character dynamics but its cluttered like its predecessor with many new elements that the audience has to buy into including more characters to accept and warm to. Alan Howarth and Paul Rabjohns' music is edgy enough especially when coupled with the original theme. Director Joe Chappelle delivers elaborate deaths and Curse is well filmed with sharp editing, flashing images and slick dialogue but it is far removed from the simplistic, primal original concept. Apparently it was a troubled shoot and many alternative scenes were shot, this may explain its unevenness. These issues spawned the notorious Producers Cut. Nevertheless, it's just as inconsistent as this version. Curse suffers like the fifth entry injecting the needless cultist sect sub-plot, mysterious symbols and a physic kid. That said, even taken with a pinch of salt it's still unsatisfying and you really feel the series has lost its way.Worth seeing if only for Pleasence's last performance.

No need to underscore the obvious, namely the stunning pictorialism of Malick's earth, sky, and crop abundance. What really grabs me are the hordes of darkly clad pickers let loose from cattle cars, and descending like human locusts upon the land. How hard they toil, yet how playfully they gambol, all amid the wide open spaces&#x97;an America not yet sliced and diced by roadways and sprawl. I doubt any Technicolor snapshot has caught this bygone era so well.Still, I have difficulty detecting a unifying theme beyond the period postcards. In short, what do these magnificent visuals add up to-- is there perhaps some underlying moral or meaning to the story itself. Then again, maybe the sum total is nothing beyond the visuals themselves, that stunning experience being more than enough. After all, the one plot line, the love triangle, seems pretty trite as far as movie fare goes. In fact, many an idyllic screen life has been lost by trying to turn three into two. Rather, I take the last scene of little Linda (the fabulous Linda Manz) as all the commentary necessary, as she skips away to a new adventure, her days of heaven already only a distant memory. America has long been a big restless land.
