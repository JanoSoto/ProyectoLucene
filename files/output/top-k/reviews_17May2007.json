The best part of this film is it's ages really well, you would think it was made only yesterday, it has one of the biggest stars in history of films Bruce Willis.OK so on to the film, it starts like any other film and sets the scene for what is a roller coaster ride that will leave you wanting more at the end. In the beginning we see John Mcclane (Bruce Willis) on a plane on his way to Los Angeles, the reason he is going there is to meet his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia who looks really attractive in this film) and it's Christmas Eve.He goes to the Nakatomi Corporation building which is where Holly works to see her and be there for his kids who he hasn't seen in a while, but during the time there he has abit of a fight with her and she gets called to give a talk, anyway John is in the bathroom insulting himself in the way how Bruce Willis does, and he ends up taking his shoes off (the person who he is sat next to on the plane says the best way to get over flying is to take your shoes off and walk bear foot and make fists with your toes...personally never tired it). During the time little does he know that a group of terrorists are planning on taking over the building (this all happens in the first 20 minutes or so).The film then really starts to go into its own as we follow an average police officer from New York in LA trying to just to get home for Christmas, still more about this film. Upon noticing that the building is being taken over by terrorists John escapes and heads to the top floor with work is still going on, and sets off the fire alarm in an attempt to get the police there. When the terrorists find out that hes set the fire alarm off from the top floor they phone the police and tell them that its nothing to worry about and send someone up to kill him, John pleased with his attempt to get back up there looks out the window and swears at them for coming to his aid, then notices they turn around.At this point they send someone up to take him out, and the person ends up getting killed, John having a wicked sense of humour (on both levels of the word) sends the dead body down the lift and takes as much as he can like the machine gun, and cigarettes as you do when your in that sort of situation, and tries on the shoes only to find they are too small. He also writes an amusing note on the persons jumper, meanwhile hes in the lift above the one that stopped taking notes on what hes up against.Later on John goes to the roof of the building to transmit a cry for help to the police and has a fairly amusing conversation on to the police, anyway at this time he gets cut off due to being attacked by the other terrorists, and they choose to send a police officer to search to see if John was telling the truth, anyway the terrorists and John are having a shoot out in one of the offices, and to get the attention John uses his head he throws the body out of the window.Now that he has some help the film moves onto a new level and the action increases more, as police road bloke outside and the FBI get involved the scale of this film (which by the way was made in 1988) starts to show. As John gets in situations and the action increases and has loads of twists and turns.In my view this film has everything to be one of the best if not they best film out there, the scale of it is amazing and the cast is true great. Words cant really describe this film, you really have to watch it, but the film does leave you wanting more and does leave you wanting to watch the next one in the series. I could talk for days about this film and it's action sequences from the very small gun fights to the massive C4 explosion and the plot which doesn't seem to lose it's appeal even after watching it infinite times, and also it's feel good factor at the end when John is back with Holly and they are in the snow (lets face it you knew they would live) but it's got something that does make you want to watch it over and over. If they made more films like this then people would probably remember what cinema is about and we may have really memorable hero's like we use to.This film should be a benchmark for ever other film that is out there trying to be an action film with a strong story, lets face it on paper it's a simple story terrorists want a building for money, they take it over, then John gets caught up in this mess...it's not hard really.But then maybe people like it because it's simple, however I think they like it, or i I like it because it's so original and has never been done before, even Die Hard 2 and 3 they push the idea of films harder and further than before. They go that one more to make it fun and try to make the story still remain simple. It's one film you have to watch and it really should be in the top 250 on IMDb.

Henry teaches Otis how to be a bloodthirsty killer, but things go awry when Otis fails to have Henry's level of control and turns his sights on to his own sister.Director John McNaughton was a delivery man for executive producers Malik B. Ali and Waleed B. Ali of Maljack Productions, who then had him make some low-budget Chicago-themed documentaries before offering him $110,000 and a 16mm camera to make a horror film (without offering any ideas or limitations).The story was brought to McNaughton by his friend Gus, who had a videotape of 20\/20. McNaughton never heard of Henry before, and was not even familiar with the term serial killer, but felt this had great potential. He had always loved horror films, especially Roger Corman's work with AIP, and he teamed up with Richard Fire of the Organic Theater (the home base of Stuart Gordon), where they found Tracy Arnold and Tom Towles. Towles, of course, would go on to work with McNaughton many more times.Along with the cast, McNaughton brought in composer Robert McNaughton (no relation), who does a fine job adding to the creep factor, and the use of samples (such as screams) was quite innovative for its day. We also get some great street scenes, showing Milwaukee Avenue in Chicago (near where director McNaughton lived). One home shot at was at the corner of North and Wood in the Wicker Park neighborhood.This film is absolutely amazing. Opening with still frame scenes of death, including a murdered hooker who is the most disturbing corpse I have seen since I watched Four Rooms (and this precedes that film by a decade). The first scene opens with the unknown victim Orange Socks, posed just as in the police photograph, only adding to the authenticity.The camera used was of lesser quality than a normal theatrical movie camera, giving a more realistic or snuff feel. I can watch heads explode and all sorts of simulated violence without flinching, but this really put me in a zone of discomfort. With a repeated viewing, this feeling decreases, but the grit of Henry is timeless.Likewise, there is a later scene where a murder is being filmed on a home video recorder. The actors go to such extremes with the violence that it looks completely plausible -- I would be surprised if the victims were not actually injured in the process. This realism is something not often found in horror, and really makes this film stand out as a groundbreaking piece of work.Michael Rooker, still a novice actor at this point, is amazing. He comes across as somehow dumb yet clever, unable to read but able to get what he needs. This fits the redneck killer profile of his character, and is so convincing you woud think Rooker himself was a little bit dumb or slow if you had not seen him in other roles (Mallrats, Days of Thunder).The use of largely unknown actors, and not very attractive ones at that, again added to the realism. Hollywood would try to make the killers ugly but do so by using beautiful people (I think Monster proved this). Henry presented us with exactly what we were promised without all the glossy shine. At a screening of Henry in Chicago in August 2008 at Portage Theater, director John McNaughton made an appearance but refused to answer questions about the picture. This is a shame, McNaughton. Not only is this the film that made you a name, but it is legitimately a great picture and possibly your best work. Please don't alienate your fans or deny yourself this great achievement.If you are looking for lots of sex and blood, you are probably looking for Murder Set Pieces (which is like this, but different at the same time -- less realism). If you want pure in-your-face brutality, this is more your style. I give it a complete recommendation, and consider it a must see for all horror fans of all ages (well, those old enough to handle the intensity, that is).One last interesting note after some distribution issues, this film was part of the reason for the MPAA's creation of NC-17 along with Pedro Almodovar's Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down.

Out of these movies, Signs delivers the simplest and most convincing answer.Yes, you do have a purpose in life. Yes, suffering through a major crisis gets you closer to it. (In fact, this may be the only way you ever open up your eyes to see.) And yes, at one point, you will suddenly and unexpectedly understand the master plan.This all is told very simply yet quite powerfully in Signs. And, if you ever get the idea how the whole setting doubles as crooked mirror for cheap pop art (surely easier to realize from a non-American perspective), you are also in for a laughter. Or a grin at least.

In this game of chance it does not matter how good or bad of a fighter you are, it is all statistics.

Also, rather pointedly, images and references to Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew pop up all over the place, with nary a mention of any sort to the opposing Humphrey-Muskie ticket, let alone third party candidate George Wallace. Clearly the intent wasn't to use the election as mere window dressing nor to focus on politics in general, but to specifically target Nixon and Agnew, whose various scandals and misdeeds came to a head in 1975, the year of SHAMPOO's release. On the one hand, the choice of dates (credited to star, co-writer and producer Warren Beatty) is ingenious, as it places the action at a pivotal point in our social and ethical history. Yet, it is also a bit disingenuous, because SHAMPOO isn't a political farce, it is a sex farce, and it seems to use Nixon as a symbolic scapegoat for the loose morality and declining sexual ethics that grew out of sex-drugs-and-rock'n'roll liberalism. Richard M. Nixon was clearly guilty of many things, but promoting promiscuity and hedonistic excesses is not among them.When you set aside the political posturing and look past the 70s soft-focus realism, SHAMPOO is really just your standard sex farce. Beatty plays George, a hustling ladies' man who juggles the affections of several women -- among them his girl of the moment, Jill (Goldie Hawn); a former lover, Jackie (Julie Christie); and a demanding, rich client, Felicia (Lee Grant), who uses him as a boytoy sex object. In true farcical fashion, all of George's women, and all of his various lies, converge on one particularly important and hectic evening, and his shaky house-of-cards love life starts to shake. The twist is that George is a Beverly Hills hairdresser, and being a straight man in a gay man's field, the film gets both a type of disguise and a form of mistaken identity which are also traditional elements of classic farce.What makes SHAMPOO atypical of farce is that it really isn't all that funny. Humorous, yes; but in a dark melancholy way. In a creepy sort of way, the film tries to be tragic farce, rather than comic farce; and it almost succeeds. As the story unfolds, George emerges as a truly hapless character; self-doubting, sexually addicted and somewhat self-destructive. You can sense the contemptuous affection he has for women and that he resents the power they have over him because he can't resist either their sexual charms or their neediness. The most interesting part of the film is trying to figure out where famed playboy Warren ends and the guilelessly libidinous George begins. To hear George\/Warren bemoaning what a burden it is to be lusted after and how taxing it is to be constantly satisfying beautiful women is at once deliciously ironic and strangely unsettling. The actor, the character and the film all seem to share a numbing self-pity that is genuinely sincere and not intended to be laughed at. And that sincerity is actually cruelly funny.Though a ladies' man he may have been, Beatty has never projected a particularly macho persona, either on screen or off. Though his soft-spoken, diffident and vaguely befuddled demeanor on screen might, indeed, hide a swaggering, conceited personality off screen, Beatty nonetheless honestly comes off as a nice guy, even when his characters are lying, manipulative jerks. In SHAMPOO, whether or not he is playing himself -- or some version of himself, clearly this movie plays off his Romeo reputation and pretty boy image with more calculated intent than any other film he has made. Watching it, you can't help wonder if what George goes through to finance a dream of his own beauty shop is really much different from what Warren had to do to get this film made. And maybe Warren's sex life wasn't much different either.But however personal the film may be, it is set on election night 1968, and the political weight it carries, whether meaningful or cavalier, can't be overlooked. I don't think the film carries any sort of pro-liberal message, or for that matter any real anti-conservative message. Indeed, it is the Republicans in the film who are the most socially conscientious, and seem to have a real hope for the future, all wrapped up in their support of Nixon. In fact, the most open-minded and optimistic person is Jack Warden's Lester, the man who unknowingly shares his wife and his mistress with his potential business partner, George. While everyone else is obsessed with sex and vanity and greed, Lester -- the film's nominal villain -- seems sincerely concerned with keeping everyone satisfied, whether it's his family, his party guests or his country. So, if the film has any political stance, it is anti-apathy. Nixon got elected, the film seems to suggest, not because Republicans are bad, but because not enough people cared, or at least they weren't paying attention. The film has two parties -- and not Democrat and Republican -- but, rather, while the GOP was celebrating victory at a fancy dinner party; sex, drugs and rock'n'roll were on the agenda at the orgy across town. SHAMPOO was already a period piece in 1975 and was considered a commentary on the Nixon years. But the story takes place in 1968, and its stinging insight is directed at the trendy superficiality of the era, political and otherwise. While 60s liberalism inspired great passion in some, to others, then as well as now, political involvement is no more enduring or meaningful than the latest hairstyle.

Also, rather pointedly, images and references to Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew pop up all over the place, with nary a mention of any sort to the opposing Humphrey-Muskie ticket, let alone third party candidate George Wallace. Clearly the intent wasn't to use the election as mere window dressing nor to focus on politics in general, but to specifically target Nixon and Agnew, whose various scandals and misdeeds came to a head in 1975, the year of SHAMPOO's release. On the one hand, the choice of dates (credited to star, co-writer and producer Warren Beatty) is ingenious, as it places the action at a pivotal point in our social and ethical history. Yet, it is also a bit disingenuous, because SHAMPOO isn't a political farce, it is a sex farce, and it seems to use Nixon as a symbolic scapegoat for the loose morality and declining sexual ethics that grew out of sex-drugs-and-rock'n'roll liberalism. Richard M. Nixon was clearly guilty of many things, but promoting promiscuity and hedonistic excesses is not among them.When you set aside the political posturing and look past the 70s soft-focus realism, SHAMPOO is really just your standard sex farce. Beatty plays George, a hustling ladies' man who juggles the affections of several women -- among them his girl of the moment, Jill (Goldie Hawn); a former lover, Jackie (Julie Christie); and a demanding, rich client, Felicia (Lee Grant), who uses him as a boytoy sex object. In true farcical fashion, all of George's women, and all of his various lies, converge on one particularly important and hectic evening, and his shaky house-of-cards love life starts to shake. The twist is that George is a Beverly Hills hairdresser, and being a straight man in a gay man's field, the film gets both a type of disguise and a form of mistaken identity which are also traditional elements of classic farce.What makes SHAMPOO atypical of farce is that it really isn't all that funny. Humorous, yes; but in a dark melancholy way. In a creepy sort of way, the film tries to be tragic farce, rather than comic farce; and it almost succeeds. As the story unfolds, George emerges as a truly hapless character; self-doubting, sexually addicted and somewhat self-destructive. You can sense the contemptuous affection he has for women and that he resents the power they have over him because he can't resist either their sexual charms or their neediness. The most interesting part of the film is trying to figure out where famed playboy Warren ends and the guilelessly libidinous George begins. To hear George\/Warren bemoaning what a burden it is to be lusted after and how taxing it is to be constantly satisfying beautiful women is at once deliciously ironic and strangely unsettling. The actor, the character and the film all seem to share a numbing self-pity that is genuinely sincere and not intended to be laughed at. And that sincerity is actually cruelly funny.Though a ladies' man he may have been, Beatty has never projected a particularly macho persona, either on screen or off. Though his soft-spoken, diffident and vaguely befuddled demeanor on screen might, indeed, hide a swaggering, conceited personality off screen, Beatty nonetheless honestly comes off as a nice guy, even when his characters are lying, manipulative jerks. In SHAMPOO, whether or not he is playing himself -- or some version of himself, clearly this movie plays off his Romeo reputation and pretty boy image with more calculated intent than any other film he has made. Watching it, you can't help wonder if what George goes through to finance a dream of his own beauty shop is really much different from what Warren had to do to get this film made. And maybe Warren's sex life wasn't much different either.But however personal the film may be, it is set on election night 1968, and the political weight it carries, whether meaningful or cavalier, can't be overlooked. I don't think the film carries any sort of pro-liberal message, or for that matter any real anti-conservative message. Indeed, it is the Republicans in the film who are the most socially conscientious, and seem to have a real hope for the future, all wrapped up in their support of Nixon. In fact, the most open-minded and optimistic person is Jack Warden's Lester, the man who unknowingly shares his wife and his mistress with his potential business partner, George. While everyone else is obsessed with sex and vanity and greed, Lester -- the film's nominal villain -- seems sincerely concerned with keeping everyone satisfied, whether it's his family, his party guests or his country. So, if the film has any political stance, it is anti-apathy. Nixon got elected, the film seems to suggest, not because Republicans are bad, but because not enough people cared, or at least they weren't paying attention. The film has two parties -- and not Democrat and Republican -- but, rather, while the GOP was celebrating victory at a fancy dinner party; sex, drugs and rock'n'roll were on the agenda at the orgy across town. SHAMPOO was already a period piece in 1975 and was considered a commentary on the Nixon years. But the story takes place in 1968, and its stinging insight is directed at the trendy superficiality of the era, political and otherwise. While 60s liberalism inspired great passion in some, to others, then as well as now, political involvement is no more enduring or meaningful than the latest hairstyle.

I had a opportunity one day of rent any movie. I always take a long time to pick anyone. So, who is whit me gets angry. Days before i had read an article of Ingmar Bergman's Fanny och Alexander. That night, in a fast selection after like an hour of think what i want to see, i pick Fanny och Alexander. In that moment i didn't know that i made an excellent decision.Fanny och Alexander or its Spanish title Fanny y Alexander or its English title Fanny and Alexander told the story about a big Swedish family. There is Fanny and Alexander. Is Christmas and all of the Ekdahl family go to the grandma house to celebrate that beautiful evening. But all have a story to told. Suddenly, Oscar, the father of Fanny and Alexander, die. His wife now is alone, but, in loved of a Bishop, she with her children's go to live to his house. But now how they stepfather, he makes an incredible religious oppression. For other side, not much time after Oscar's death, he appears to his children's... then, Alexander is questioned about lying. And then we are questioned about if we are lying, or if grown ups are lying. And then, the real reality is our real imagination.Is hard to say few things of an extensive work like Fanny och Alexander because its unique in its kind. This work is a haunting masterpiece of a filmmaker who i don't know much. I only have see Smulstrontället (Another beautiful masterpiece). But i think that with this two works, i can take now an image of Ingmar Bergman, as a creative and sensitive filmmaker. With certain mysterious qualities, Fanny och Alexander told us a story of questions based in children's and grown ups mentalities, its problems and its pleasures. Minute by minute, the movie, with a ghostly touch, it makes us more sensitive, and, at the same time, we cant despite some moments of complete nostalgia. The film confronts different subjects like family, death, childhood, religion and reality. Its a metaphysical work which explores reality based in that things that we think real and in that things that we think that are just imagination, specially from a kid like Alexander. And the we questioned about the real reality, which doesn't exist. Each one had its reality. I think that the only reality in this moment is Alexander's reality. He cries when he thinks that God go to show to him a face. He wants to live a normal life, a life that the bishop don't wants, just maybe his childhood was horrible and he thinks that if he want that Alexander be a good man, he cant live with any toys, locked with his sister in a room. Then we see its reality confronted with supposed real reality of grown ups. Then, we found Alexander wishes, which are the imagination confronted with the real reality. He hates the bishop. The bishop don't hate Alexander, its afraid of him. At the end we found to grandma with Alexander in his arms. All go on, the time and space don't exist. In the thin mark of the reality the imagination creates new patterns As much of you know, Fanny och Alexander runs with a duration of more of 3 hours, but there is a special version for TV, which runs with more of 5 hours. When i was seeing the theatrical version, i think in a few seconds how can be the TV version. But... well, sometimes i think that its not so important, maybe the theatrical version is more feeling packed, and TV version is more slow and complete. But still, Theatrical version is excellent, maybe exact. Fanny och Alexander is one of those works that you cant forget... and believe me, i never going to forget it.*Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any.

Ultimately, where you stand will probably have more to do with what kinds of movies you have a preference for. If you like intelligent, absorbing sci-fi and atmospheric horror, Alien is the choice. If you like adrenaline-charged action and mind-blowing special effects, Aliens gets the nod. Or if you're anything like me, and love both styles of movies, you'll be in for a treat, as both films are near the tops of the list no matter which way you try to slice it.Aliens is the right way to do a sequel. It carries the storyline where the first film leaves off, and rather than regurgitate the formula, it takes the story into a new direction, and does so without ever losing momentum in the process. There is also a maturation in the characters, all of whom change as the film drives forward, rather than stay stuck in shallow stereotypes. Ripley (Weaver, Ghostbusters) started off Alien as your average woman who is thrust into bravery out of necessity, and this trend continues, seeing her go the distance in becoming a full-fledged soldier in doing what's right (from a humanistic point of view). Even the supporting characters change on a smaller scale, with the diminutive Newt learning that she can trust someone again, while the big-talking' Hudson (Paxton, Apollo 13) eats a bit of humble pie once he gets a taste of how dominating the menace truly is. This isn't just great action, it's terrific character development, and while the technical aspects do leave a lasting impression, it's really the quality screen writing by Cameron that allows the film to pay off in a large way as the film heads toward its explosive conclusion.

My favorite example is 1998's Ever After with its feminist protagonist and more in-depth love story. I was happily convinced that that was the only version of Cinderella for me. Yet, after recently viewing The Slipper and the Rose, I've decided this lush, 1976 musical comes a close second. Despite its daunting length of 143 minutes (parents of kids used to the breezy Disney cartoon may want to think twice about showing this to the little ones), The Slipper and the Rose is a beautifully photographed (filmed in Austria), immensely enjoyable lark of a movie that is a must for any fairy tale fan. It dares to address issues that other Cinderella adaptations fail to acknowledge the futility of trying to find the maiden who fits this slipper (that's right, our prince doesn't find Cinderella in the way you'd expect), the hard knock life of a fairy godmother, and the difficulties of two people from different ranks in life to marry. Strangely enough, The Slipper and the Rose is almost more about the prince than Cinderella. This isn't our grandparents' Prince Charming. Our handsome prince, Edward, isn't some vapid mannequin of a human being, but an idealistic, humorous, earthy, passionate young man with his own ideas of how to live his life and find his queen. He also loathes the idea of being the grand prize in the ball. Edward is brought exquisitely to life by Richard Chamberlain, who lends his softly handsome face and supple singing voice to this charming tale. Gemma Craven as Cinderella is hit or miss, but she's a pleasant singer and game dancer, and brings a serene maturity to the part. We are also treated to a perfectly smarmy wicked stepmother, a doltish, Mel Brooks-like king, and an eccentric, cranky fairy godmother. The songs are catchy and delightful, written by the Sherman brothers, best known for their work in Mary Poppins. Protocol-igorrically Correct won't easily leave your head, and When He Danced With Me is sung by Craven with infectious joy and passion. This a fine adaptation of Cinderella full of surprises, romance, and even a layer of complexity.

The constable(James Bell)warns Professor Warren(George Brent)that he has traced the killer's whereabouts to the Warren estate and to keep an eye open for anything suspicious. Helen Capel(Dorothy McGuire, who is excellent)has been mute since the horrible house fire which killed her parents. A new physician in town, Dr. Parry(Kent Smith)believes the condition is psychological and that Helen must confront what has caused her silence. He believes there's help in Boston which can cure Helen's ailment..Parry is also in love with Helen and vice versa. But, Helen is indeed a woman that the killer might target as she is hired help for the ailing stepmother of the Professor, Mrs. Warren(Ethel Barrymore, also quite good in a rather underwritten role)and so her life could be in danger as long as she remains at the estate's spooky mansion where a possible killer might be lurking. We see, when Helen returned from a movie house where the killer strangled the lame female, that someone is watching her hidden in darkness. Director Siodmak has the camera close in on the killer's crazed, widening eye as it peers at the next chosen victim. So we are informed by the eye staring at Helen(..with the bonus imagined face of Helen without a mouth inside the pupil of the killer's eye)she is to be chosen as the next possible victim setting up the creepy story within the dark, rain-drenched mansion where shadow and light converge. A possible suspect might be the Professor's brother Steve(Gordon Oliver)who arrived home from Paris just as the murders started. Blanche(Rhonda Fleming)is the Professor's secretary, his former flame, now secretly Steve's lover. Mrs. Oates(Elsa Lanchester, who is a hoot and easily steals every scene she's in), the maid, can't resist taking a nip of brandy when she can sneak a bottle from the Professor's cellar. She keeps having to close an open window which had been shut..this is Siodmak's way of informing us that the killer is within the house. Mr. Oates(Rhys Williams)is the man who helps fetch supplies among other duties on the grounds of the Warren estate. He'll have to fetch some ether as the matriarch Warren falls ill often passing out when rattled in her weakened condition. Mrs. Warren constantly warns Helen to leave the premises for her own safety..she seems to feel that danger awaits Helen in the mansion. With Mrs. Oates drunk as a skunk, soon a murder within the cellar has Helen fearing for her life as it seems most are gone from the estate..Parry gets a call from a sick boy, Mr. Oates is off to fetch ether & someone is murdered while two suspects might have something to do with it as Helen must somehow survive on her own.This film has that kind of building dread, and great looking, atmospheric B&W photography one craves when looking for a classic Gothic thriller. The story regarding how a mute, who can not cry for help when the killer is revealed, is perfect within this mansion setting. Using candlelight when certain characters walk into the darkened cellar(where a murder takes place), Siodmak shows his excellence at creating tension. You just know that the cellar is the perfect place for a killer to hide with the ability to catch a victim off-guard when they have their back turned. Also, the spiral staircase of the title is served well thanks to the moving camera and how Siodmak lights it. Just a wonderful little creeper with McGuire in a winning role as she must convey various emotions without uttering a word.

She keeps having to close an open window which had been shut..this is Siodmak's way of informing us that the killer is within the house. Mr. Oates(Rhys Williams)is the man who helps fetch supplies among other duties on the grounds of the Warren estate. He'll have to fetch some ether as the matriarch Warren falls ill often passing out when rattled in her weakened condition. Mrs. Warren constantly warns Helen to leave the premises for her own safety..she seems to feel that danger awaits Helen in the mansion. With Mrs. Oates drunk as a skunk, soon a murder within the cellar has Helen fearing for her life as it seems most are gone from the estate..Parry gets a call from a sick boy, Mr. Oates is off to fetch ether & someone is murdered while two suspects might have something to do with it as Helen must somehow survive on her own.This film has that kind of building dread, and great looking, atmospheric B&W photography one craves when looking for a classic Gothic thriller. The story regarding how a mute, who can not cry for help when the killer is revealed, is perfect within this mansion setting. Using candlelight when certain characters walk into the darkened cellar(where a murder takes place), Siodmak shows his excellence at creating tension. You just know that the cellar is the perfect place for a killer to hide with the ability to catch a victim off-guard when they have their back turned. Also, the spiral staircase of the title is served well thanks to the moving camera and how Siodmak lights it. Just a wonderful little creeper with McGuire in a winning role as she must convey various emotions without uttering a word. ","genre":"Film-Noir, Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"17 May 2007","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Just magnificent psychological tale of suspense regarding a serial killer on the loose, who targets women with imperfections(one was lame, another was simple-minded). The constable(James Bell)warns Professor Warren(George Brent)that he has traced the killer's whereabouts to the Warren estate and to keep an eye open for anything suspicious. Helen Capel(Dorothy McGuire, who is excellent)has been mute since the horrible house fire which killed her parents. A new physician in town, Dr. Parry(Kent Smith)believes the condition is psychological and that Helen must confront what has caused her silence. He believes there's help in Boston which can cure Helen's ailment..Parry is also in love with Helen and vice versa. But, Helen is indeed a woman that the killer might target as she is hired help for the ailing stepmother of the Professor, Mrs. Warren(Ethel Barrymore, also quite good in a rather underwritten role)and so her life could be in danger as long as she remains at the estate's spooky mansion where a possible killer might be lurking. We see, when Helen returned from a movie house where the killer strangled the lame female, that someone is watching her hidden in darkness. Director Siodmak has the camera close in on the killer's crazed, widening eye as it peers at the next chosen victim. So we are informed by the eye staring at Helen(..with the bonus imagined face of Helen without a mouth inside the pupil of the killer's eye)she is to be chosen as the next possible victim setting up the creepy story within the dark, rain-drenched mansion where shadow and light converge. A possible suspect might be the Professor's brother Steve(Gordon Oliver)who arrived home from Paris just as the murders started. Blanche(Rhonda Fleming)is the Professor's secretary, his former flame, now secretly Steve's lover.

Do you like hockey? What kind of hockey do you like? To the first, I give a resounding yes. To the second I say that hitting has always been and will always be a part of the game, but I have never been a fan of stick work or trying to knock good players out of the game. It's that idea that the movie tries to put forth, that Youngblood needs to fight to be a good hockey player, is simply not true. Hell, they could have put future NHL star Steve Stumpy Thomas out there to take care of hitting. He is the brick wall wearing number 12 that coach Ed Lauter tries to put on the ice. Anyway, this one of those fighting against the odds movies that just doesn't have enough going for it. They should have taken the movie out to the barn and taught it how to punch.
