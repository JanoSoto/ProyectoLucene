Or the character as the case may be. I did really like the movie, but I thought that at times it got too slick with its presentation. It suffers from the same faults as all action films despite being a satire of action films on a certain level -- the action simply can't be intense enough to hold the hardcore audience's attention in the beginning and still ratchet up to something even more grotesque without becoming completely unreal and potentially laughable in and of itself. But you could say the same thing about some of Paul Verhoeven's best action satires like Starship Troopers that weren't even as clear as Fight Club about actually throwing the macho ethic into question. It seems to just go with the territory.So in some respects this film belongs to the same school as films like Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly or Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs in that it's a kind of theater of excess, basically throwing macho types out there and not so much deconstructing them as just pushing them so far over the edge that they already appear hyper-real. But I think the film sort of betrays that in some of its last sequences. That's the kind of thing that I think I'll be able to say later after I've seen it again. I do want to watch it again because certain scenes, especially the ones with Helena Bonham Carter (who I always WANT to like more than I usually do), are really appealing for some reason.The thing that holds me back from embracing the movie is that it just seemed a bit too proud of itself, and the story was a bit too ridiculous even in the end when all was explained to actually take it as seriously as it seemed to want to be taken. I'm going to see what I think ultimately though at some later point. This is the type of movie that might either go up or down in my estimation when I have a better handle on it.

It is unusual for two such films to be released in close proximity. I think that 2001 has a considerable advantage over this film. I don't by any means think it is a bad film. It has lots of elements and features of a good one, good music, a good story and an interesting plot. What I think brings it down is its lead actor Charlton Heston and its long winded and often irrelevant talking scenes.Obviously films need to use dialogue and conversation between characters to make the film work. The impossibility of this film without dialogue is obvious. However what I found is that many of the scenes were basically Heston sat talking to the camera and whatever other characters appeared on screen. The film made very little use of it's potential for large visual sequences, there were a couple of instances of this, but mainly I thought, in something like planet of the apes, which has so much potential for such scenes, it was lacking. Instead relying mainly on dialogue to push the story forward.Â There are exceptions to the above, like the child's doll which is found in the cave. When the doll makes the noise, it is a brilliant moment, the look of triumph on the humans faces, compared to that of shock and dismay on the Apes, is a great contrast. The soundtrack is also good, with the music almost always fitting the moment in question on scene, what I will say is that some of it could be quite repetitive, with the same music sequence being used for several scenes. However that barely matters, because I still maintain that the film would of lost some of its effect with no soundtrack.The cinematography is pretty standard, there is nothing paticyualy exciting about any of the shots. The camera Is often stationary, and I did sometimes think that the characters were just talking heads.I feel that my point on dialogue needs expanding. The things I enjoyed about this film were some of the more visual scenes. Whilst I accept that the film does need some dialogue to move the story forward and to explore the society and system, what I don't accept is that dialogue is the best way to do it. There are some films which solely rely on dialogue, but these are of a different sort and on a different sort of scale. With Planet of The Apes, which is essentially about exploration and discovering a new world, I would of expected more to be done with this. Yet what we get is essentially characters sat on screen and talking. This can work as other films I have seen have shown, but really here the talking is dull and unimaginative, with some of the characters spouting some terrible one liners. What I think the film needed was more scenes like the awesome chase scene, when Taylor tries to escape from the Apes custody. This scene is probably one of the best in the film, and all it is is Charlton Hedton running around the screen being pursued by a group of Apes. Yet it is more interesting than a lot of the dialogue which was mainly unimaginative and lacked anything to keep my interest.I want to mention the chase scene, which to me was one of the best bits about the film. Yes it's a tried and tested formula. But I really enjoyed it, I loved how the supposedly inferior human first escapes from the cell and then goes on to allude capture against a vastly larger force for far longer than expected. To me this is more telling than a lot of the dialogue, and is a direct demonstration of one of the ideas of the film which is the superiority of certain classes etc.Â I can appreciate that other people may find this film more entertaining than I and that they like the commentary on Â society that the film offers. I do accept that there is an awful lot of this, but in my eyes it is unsubtle and very obvious. Maybe it's meant to be obvious, but even so I don't think that this does the film any credit and I would rather have a more subtle commentary on our society. As in some ways the way the film is means that this part of the story takes over, and doesn't leave much room for manoeuvring other more minor plot points, and leaves little room for character development, with Charlton Hestons Taylor being an obvious example of this.The ending of the film, if you haven't seen the film is a shocker. As Heston rides along the beach, it leaves you wondering how the film is going to end. It is a good ploy, because the main action sequence has played put, and it feels like everything is coming to a close. In some ways I still expect to see the Horse ride off into the distance, and the credits roll. So when the real ending emerges it is definitely a shock. It is perhaps a cheeky trick by the director, and it is not acted in the best way.

For me, the movie works as an insight into a few boys life at Welton in 1959. First of all that year excites me, they were on the cusp of revolution and perhaps a few could predict what would happen a year later but the mini revolution that was started at the school, the daring concept of character over tradition, was something that would change those boys lives. In good ways, in bad ways but ultimately it would be a test of their characters in BIG ways.The story starts off with a new teacher. Robin Williams plays the passionate John Keating. He wants to teach the boys poetry ..not lines, but poetry in their souls. It is that spirit of such poetry and the spirit of carpe diem (seize the day) that is lit like a candle in some boys and a fire in others; Neil, Todd, Charlie, Knox, Meeks and Pitts as well as a few other of their classmates.Neil (Robert Sean Leonard pre, pre House) is a star pupil who wants to act, Todd (Ethan Hawke) is the new shy boy, Charlie (Gale Hansen) makes the boys laugh and us audience laugh and swoon, Knox (Josh Charles) is the one who dares to woo a girl he meets at a formal dinner, Meeks is the sweet boy and he and Pitts are scientifically both challenged and inspired.Mr Keating tells them to rip out anything that restricts their thinking. Poetry should be FELT. After all, we each have poetry in us and we each apply it in different ways. Not everyone actually reads and writes poetry, some spend hours trying to find a solution to a problem. That is what the movie is about to me, the spirit of that poetry and I feel it could have alienated people had it been more about the poetry, instead it doesn't pay lip service to poets and poems, but it gets right down to their core; which is their spirit.And I would have done what they did in their cave meetings too, which is basically have fun.My only minor problem with the movie lies in what Keating says- despite not being a scientist myself, I believe science can also be a source of beauty, poetry and something to stay alive for also. But I'm taking Mr Keating too literally and I'm sure Meeks and Pitts who were the scientists would have remembered what Mr Keating said and applied passion to science.The tragedy of the movie lies in the most passionate and proactive personality in the movie, the one whose Mr Keating's teachings light a fire inside. It is even more tragic given the year..perhaps ten years later, what happens would not have happened, one has to wonder.There have been those who find that storyline unrealistic and yet it is realistic, in that it happens. It's also a cautionary tales to parents who want to live through their children, I can even see similarities in this movie and Mahabharat which is a big epic in India based on fact.For me it took time to understand the character involved the storyline, because the movie is not a sit down let's talk type, it doesn't give you the answers, it doesn't underestimate the audience, it's an old school movie. I will say no more other than I think this character wanted to seize the passion.And like life, things and people in Dead Poets Society are always moving, the movie relies on you as an audience to pay attention and you might, just might, catch something that you missed before or that the person next to you missed. Poetry isn't going to make your life neat and tidy nor is it going to change your life, that is up to you. Mr Keating didn't come along with an in depth character analysis and the movie is dynamic, it has kinetic energy, when you see Welton, you see see different angled shots in the corridors, in class rooms, outside you see nature, there's music, on paper it sounds like any other movie but on screen Dead Poets Society is alive. Mr Keating represents the movie..and we represent the students. He COULD change our lives..if we keep ourselves open to what he says. That's how I like to watch this movie.And the final scene was not trite nor sweet to me, nor a kiss up, it was a final straw for a a living, breathing, sad, perhaps angry and inspired soul of a student AND a boy. A sweet ending wouldn't have any of that because it would tie things up and not leave them open. But like life Dead Poets Society isn't a carefully arranged neat little present. It's only neatness lies in how its made, a beautiful quality of a movie, I don't know the technical terms but I can say the cinematography and the direction are not slow, or too fast, when Keating is talking you see his words in each of the students faces, their reactions. Peter Weir the director has links between his movies, action and reaction and every person taking charge of their life, you watch Gallipoli, The Truman Show and Master and Commander, it's about human spirit. The final scene of Dead Poets Society is about human spirit, don't conform, take charge of your life and make a stand for what you believe in. The power of that scene can be applied to a grand action or a small one, but it's something I remember whenever I am forced to cower, with the rest of the world as Mr Nolans- the headmaster of Welton, trying to get me to their way or to be quiet.

I will say no more other than I think this character wanted to seize the passion.And like life, things and people in Dead Poets Society are always moving, the movie relies on you as an audience to pay attention and you might, just might, catch something that you missed before or that the person next to you missed. Poetry isn't going to make your life neat and tidy nor is it going to change your life, that is up to you. Mr Keating didn't come along with an in depth character analysis and the movie is dynamic, it has kinetic energy, when you see Welton, you see see different angled shots in the corridors, in class rooms, outside you see nature, there's music, on paper it sounds like any other movie but on screen Dead Poets Society is alive. Mr Keating represents the movie..and we represent the students. He COULD change our lives..if we keep ourselves open to what he says. That's how I like to watch this movie.And the final scene was not trite nor sweet to me, nor a kiss up, it was a final straw for a a living, breathing, sad, perhaps angry and inspired soul of a student AND a boy. A sweet ending wouldn't have any of that because it would tie things up and not leave them open. But like life Dead Poets Society isn't a carefully arranged neat little present. It's only neatness lies in how its made, a beautiful quality of a movie, I don't know the technical terms but I can say the cinematography and the direction are not slow, or too fast, when Keating is talking you see his words in each of the students faces, their reactions. Peter Weir the director has links between his movies, action and reaction and every person taking charge of their life, you watch Gallipoli, The Truman Show and Master and Commander, it's about human spirit. The final scene of Dead Poets Society is about human spirit, don't conform, take charge of your life and make a stand for what you believe in. The power of that scene can be applied to a grand action or a small one, but it's something I remember whenever I am forced to cower, with the rest of the world as Mr Nolans- the headmaster of Welton, trying to get me to their way or to be quiet. Except I watched the movie and I won't.

In opera, modern productions frequently work well, but it's harder with Shakespeare, because he is so poetic that the surroundings need to reflect it, lest they undermine the poetic integrity. The milieu can't be pedestrian, and the words can't be casually and mumblingly delivered. In Almereyda's Hamlet, everything is pedestrian. There are great actors on hand, but they are never given the opportunity to shine. There is no depth of either intellect or comedy here (as Stanley Wells has remarked, Hamlet is the most comical of all the tragedies), and as others have mentioned it is particularly ironic to cast Bill Murray in the role of the play's comic relief character and then have him be serious throughout. Sigh. There is occasional decent acting from Schreiber, Styles and Venora, but I have nothing good to say about the rest. They can do much better, but the director must have failed to inspire them.The movie is a mess. All right, so it is trying to make some analogous points about a struggling film-maker, but it doesn't work well. To replace the medium of the play with the medium of the film as the thing in which the king's conscience will be caught is not a very interesting point, as plays and movies are so similar anyway.There were a couple of things I liked. I liked having the To be or not to be speech in the Action aisle of the video store, because that speech really is much more about action than about death. I also liked how Julia Stiles made it very apparent that the cause of Ophelia's madness was her powerful love for him, which he didn't requite. I don't think this is necessarily the best interpretation of what happens, but at least it is a clear one.But a main reason the movie is a mess is that the text is so chopped up. Omissions are inevitable lest the movie runs 4 hours, but it should be done with great care. Using the text selectively, and moving it around, always runs the risk of seriously undermining Shakespeare's points and messages, and one therefore needs a tremendously detailed understanding of the text (and its best interpretations) in order to edit it sensibly. Sadly, Almereyda does not possess such understanding.The movie is not completely awful; it is watchable, but most things about it just aren't very good. The characters often don't speak clearly, which debases (yes, debases!) Shakespeare's language, and the modern surroundings tend to be dull, dull, dull. Of the twelve different Hamlets I have seen on DVD, I'm afraid this one is nothing less than the worst of the lot.4 out of 10.

I liked having the To be or not to be speech in the Action aisle of the video store, because that speech really is much more about action than about death. I also liked how Julia Stiles made it very apparent that the cause of Ophelia's madness was her powerful love for him, which he didn't requite. I don't think this is necessarily the best interpretation of what happens, but at least it is a clear one.But a main reason the movie is a mess is that the text is so chopped up. Omissions are inevitable lest the movie runs 4 hours, but it should be done with great care. Using the text selectively, and moving it around, always runs the risk of seriously undermining Shakespeare's points and messages, and one therefore needs a tremendously detailed understanding of the text (and its best interpretations) in order to edit it sensibly. Sadly, Almereyda does not possess such understanding.The movie is not completely awful; it is watchable, but most things about it just aren't very good. The characters often don't speak clearly, which debases (yes, debases!) Shakespeare's language, and the modern surroundings tend to be dull, dull, dull.

In opera, modern productions frequently work well, but it's harder with Shakespeare, because he is so poetic that the surroundings need to reflect it, lest they undermine the poetic integrity. The milieu can't be pedestrian, and the words can't be casually and mumblingly delivered. In Almereyda's Hamlet, everything is pedestrian.

Ludwig Van Beethoven is my all time favourite classical music composer, and having watched Eroica with Ian Hart and the 3-part BBC dramatisation of Beethoven with Paul Rhys, I wanted to see what this film was like. My conclusion is that Immortal Beloved is a visually audacious, musically majestic and imaginative near-masterpiece.Immortal Beloved certainly looks stunning. The scenery is gorgeous, the costumes sumptuous and the cinematography fluid and beautiful. Seriously when you are transported to 18th century Vienna you feel like you have just come out of a time machine. There are also many effective scenes such as young Ludwig running away from his abusive father, Johanna visiting Beethoven as he lies dying in bed (one of the few times when a piece of classical music-the String Quartet Op.130 here- reduced me to tears in just one scene of one film), Beethoven resting his ear while playing the Moonlight Sonata, Beethoven with his back to the audience during the performance of the Choral Symphony and the performance of the Emperor concerto(I did read somewhere that during a concert when the orchestra wouldn't play the piece right, Beethoven stopped it and ordered for it to be played again). Even the use of Missa Solemnis was beautifully done, so hauntingly beautiful.The music is a revelation, pretty much the heart and soul of the film. It is a true delight from start to finish, I loved hearing the Moonlight and Pathetique sonatas, the Choral Symphony(the Ode to Joy movement has always been my favourite work of his), the Emperor Concerto,the violin concerto, Missa Solemnis and the 2nd movement of the 7th symphony as it was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Georg Solti.Bernard Rose is an unusual choice for director, having directed the gruesome horror film Caddyshack, but he does respectably as he seeks to identify the immortal beloved of Beethoven's will(to this day we don't know who Beethoven is referring to). The scripting is intelligent and moving, one might say it doesn't say much, but it has heart, and the story is solid, deep and doesn't meander.The acting is uniformly excellent. Jeroen Krabbe is fine as Anton Schindler, and Isabella Rosselini, Johanna ter Steege and Valeria Golino look beautiful and act very convincingly as the suspects of Beethoven's affections. I have to say though Gary Oldman does give the best performance of the film, while some scenes could have done with a touch more moderato it was a superb, charismatic and moving performance. I have read complaints that Oldman overacted, complaints I don't agree with at all. Just because Beethoven shouts a lot here, doesn't mean Oldman was overacting, and he certainly didn't overact in the final scene between him and Johanna, his acting was a masterclass of sheer poignancy there. Beethoven wasn't exactly a knight in shining armour now was he? He was rude, aggressive and reacted vehemently to even the smallest thing and probably traumatised by the memories of being abused by his alcoholic father. Beethoven also encountered alcoholism and increasing deafness, and by 1812 or so he was deaf completely.Overall, this is a wonderful, underrated film. Only problem with it? I did feel the ending was a little too open-and-shut, but maybe it is just me.

At first glance it resembles An American Werewolf in London, without the humour, but from a 21st century perspective it reminds me even more of Candyman, which had yet to be adapted for film. Clive Barker's story was more inventive, and the film was scarier, but Cat People (remake or not) is pretty evocative as well. It's not as cheap as it may sound. The animals here are real. If anything Cat People has a bit of a throwback attitude to a time when monsters were sexy, (or some monsters at least). After vampires, cats may be the next most seductive of creatures.

I can think of many different ways to tell a story about werewolves, but anything I could direct wouldn't be half as creative as The Howling 3 The Marsupials. It's an amusingly self-aware parody of the previous entries deeply rooted in loving Australian stereotypes. As weird as it is, I almost feel uncomfortable reviewing it as part of my bad movie series. The movie is stuffed with strange and sometimes sudden jolts of humor that are too effective to have been by chance.Mora separated himself from Gary Brandner's novels, and created an unrelated new story. There are a few nudges to the first two films for fans (including a cool last scene parody of the last scene from the first Howling), but this one is a name-only sequel and takes place in Australia and the United States. The humor is increased and the violence is reduced (this is the only one so far to be rated PG13). It was also the final Howling film to be released theatrically in the States.As the movie begins, we see a disheveled young woman riding on a bus full of nuns. One of them asks her why she left her family, and the girl says, My stepfather tried to rape me and he's a werewolf. The actress says the line curtly and I can't tell if it is a misfire or subtle comedy. It's worth a quick chuckle before the story gets going. The girl, who we soon learn is called Jerboa goes to Sydney where men immediately start to leer at her suggestively. She sends them packing with a cute growl and rests for the night.The next day some guy chases her for a while to ask her if she would like to star in a werewolf movie. She agrees and goes onset to a production of a movie that looks like one of the many knock-offs of The Wolf Man. The production values are so poor that you can clearly see the actor's hand throbbing about in the werewolf costume. After the first day, Donny, the guy who asked her to be in the movie, takes her to see a real werewolf movie in theaters. Whatever they watch has similar transformation effects to the first Howling film, which Jerboa says is unrealistic. Real werewolves transform whenever they want by gaining a lot of hair as the camera cuts away or if exposed to bright lights (possible nod to Gremlins, helmed by Howling director Joe Dante).The two of them become intimate and Jerboa becomes pregnant with Donny's child. At a hospital visit, we learn that she has a pouch on her abdomen. She is a marsupial human (sort of)! Doctors and professors all over the world are curious to investigate other cases of wolf people and trace Jerboa's path back to her rapist stepfather's village.

I can think of many different ways to tell a story about werewolves, but anything I could direct wouldn't be half as creative as The Howling 3 The Marsupials. It's an amusingly self-aware parody of the previous entries deeply rooted in loving Australian stereotypes. As weird as it is, I almost feel uncomfortable reviewing it as part of my bad movie series. The movie is stuffed with strange and sometimes sudden jolts of humor that are too effective to have been by chance.Mora separated himself from Gary Brandner's novels, and created an unrelated new story. There are a few nudges to the first two films for fans (including a cool last scene parody of the last scene from the first Howling), but this one is a name-only sequel and takes place in Australia and the United States. The humor is increased and the violence is reduced (this is the only one so far to be rated PG13). It was also the final Howling film to be released theatrically in the States.As the movie begins, we see a disheveled young woman riding on a bus full of nuns. One of them asks her why she left her family, and the girl says, My stepfather tried to rape me and he's a werewolf. The actress says the line curtly and I can't tell if it is a misfire or subtle comedy. It's worth a quick chuckle before the story gets going. The girl, who we soon learn is called Jerboa goes to Sydney where men immediately start to leer at her suggestively. She sends them packing with a cute growl and rests for the night.The next day some guy chases her for a while to ask her if she would like to star in a werewolf movie. She agrees and goes onset to a production of a movie that looks like one of the many knock-offs of The Wolf Man. The production values are so poor that you can clearly see the actor's hand throbbing about in the werewolf costume. After the first day, Donny, the guy who asked her to be in the movie, takes her to see a real werewolf movie in theaters. Whatever they watch has similar transformation effects to the first Howling film, which Jerboa says is unrealistic. Real werewolves transform whenever they want by gaining a lot of hair as the camera cuts away or if exposed to bright lights (possible nod to Gremlins, helmed by Howling director Joe Dante).The two of them become intimate and Jerboa becomes pregnant with Donny's child. At a hospital visit, we learn that she has a pouch on her abdomen. She is a marsupial human (sort of)! Doctors and professors all over the world are curious to investigate other cases of wolf people and trace Jerboa's path back to her rapist stepfather's village.
