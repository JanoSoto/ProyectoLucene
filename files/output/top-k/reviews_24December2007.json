All this means he is due for a visit by three ghosts, bent on showing him the error of his ways. But is Cross too cynical even for them?Funny how things work out. Murray was reportedly unhappy with Scrooged, as was director Richard Donner and co-screenwriter Michael O'Donoghue, one of Saturday Night Live's darkest and most legendary figures. Yet maybe because of the behind-the-scenes turmoil, including a release date so delayed two principal cast members were already dead when it came out, Scrooged works beautifully as one of filmdom's strangest salutes to the Christmas spirit.What's great about Scrooged? You have to start with Murray, who nails Cross with a combination of sneering sarcasm and bitter one-liners. Even when his old boss, Lew Hayward (John Forsyth), strolls into his office seven years after suffering a fatal heart attack, Cross doesn't budge.Gah, has it been that long? Cross says. To look at you, I wouldn't have guessed more than three, tops.Forsyth's funnier than I've ever seen him, but the ace make-up job alerts you to the fact this is one Christmas Carol remake that's playing for serious stakes. One reason I think the film failed to find greater popularity is it confused people expecting a Yuletide Ghostbusters to see Murray stuck inside a coffin, begging to live.But for those who stick with it, and allow for the off-chance that through its bizzaro comedy it may strike the odd chord, Scrooged works terrifically well at challenging us about how cynicism and despair are ruts one needs to kick oneself out of, and that life in the end may boil down to something as simple as put a little love in your heart.That's why the ending works so well for me, because it really does much the same thing Dickens did 150 years ago, risking a little strenuousness for the sake of a message about self-betterment. It's especially striking when one considers O'Donoghue's normal family sensibilities ran along the lines of promo announcements for shows like The Waltons Eat Their Young.You get similar promo comedy at the start of Scrooged, along with Robert Mitchum as the network boss who counsels Frank about strategic programming for cats What about a cop that dangles string? I think O'Donoghue enjoyed the television satire especially, though he may indulge himself a little too much at the expense of a network censor.Carol Kane and David Johansen shine as two of the Christmas spirits, while Karen Allen adds a lot of heart as the girl Cross left behind on his road to success. The film is shambolic, cluttered, and a lot of jokes fall flat, but there are a lot of other jokes that score, as well as an underlying message to exterminate the humbug in the hardest of hearts.For some, A Christmas Story and It's A Wonderful Life may be an annual event, but for me, there can be no seasonal substitute for the twisted Chrismas carol that is Scrooged.

The animatronics and puppets are obvious but cool to watch. While on the topic of dated, it is kind of amusing to see this movie take place surrounded by 80's style (that's some BIG hair). The film is loaded with plenty of action but it does slow down a bit after the first half when the audience is treated to the bulk of the movie's exposition.

As minor as his role is, for some reason, he always makes me cringe. For some reason, he just aggravates me in this movie. Of course, he's only on screen for two minutes and his role means near to nothing, so ignore my rant.The movie does have a couple plot holes, but only if you feel like feeding a headache with thoughts of time travel mechanics.

David Niven plays his role as Colonel Race with class and Mia Farrow almost steals the show(boat) as the seemingly jilted Jackie. Angela Lansbury's a bit underused as tipsy Salome (pronounced SAL-OM-AE) Otterbourne but a pure delight to watch nonetheless. George Ed Hocken Kennedy also has a supporting role as Andrew Pennington, which he plays okay. Some say Lois Chiles does not play her role well as Linnet Ridgeway, I do not totally agree with this, as the character is firm and careful in her dealings and a strong businesswoman. Chiles kinda reminds me of Christina Applegate in appearance and a bit of myself in personality, though I have more enthusiasm in my voice. Bette Davis is in top form as Ms. Van Schuyler and Maggie Smith matches up well as her nurse Miss Bowers. The on-location filming in Egypt works beautifully also.Recently I watched this with my mom, and she wasn't entirely wrong about the frightening parts. If you get scared by these parts, try what the people at Science World tell you to do at the Omnimax Theater when you get dizzy shut your eyes, though you probably won't be too frightened if you watch CSI regularly. Overall, I give this great mystery a 7 outta 10, because a little bit more work could've been done on the comedy parts. I found Jackie's drunken liquor verses clever, by the way.

I'm not sure exactly how long it's been since then, but I have finally seen it again. Knowing that it wasn't the most highly praised Christmas movie, I didn't have super-high expectations, but thought maybe it would be mildly enjoyable. Sadly, for the most part, I didn't even find that.Scott Calvin is a divorced father whose son, Charlie comes to stay with him on Christmas Eve one year. That night, Charlie hears noise coming from the roof of the house, and goes to wake his father up! Scott then goes out to investigate, and calls up to a man on the roof, who then falls off! Although Scott doesn't believe this is actually Santa Clause at first (he stopped believing in Santa long ago), he finds instructions to continue the job from there, and he and Charlie soon start flying around from house to house in the sleigh, as Scott delivers the presents! Once finished, the father and son are taken to the North Pole, where Scott is told that since he has put the suit on, he is now Santa! The next morning, it seems like it was all just a dream to Scott, but Charlie is convinced that his father really is Santa Clause! As the following year goes by, Scott finds himself gaining weight and growing facial hair at a rapid pace! He is now convinced it's all true, but obviously not too many others would believe it, so can he trust Charlie to keep it a secret? During my most recent viewing of The Santa Clause, at first, I had trouble getting into it, but around the part where Scott and Charlie are out investigating, it started to look more promising, even though the farting reindeer was uncalled for. However, starting with the North Pole, I found that it went back downhill. During the film, I laughed or smiled here and there, but not too many of the gags were memorable. Scott about to be sucked through a pipe in a house that has no chimney is a memorable and funny scene, but there are not too many others I can think of. I was also expecting to find the movie touching towards the end, but I found the moments (at least most of them) that were supposed to be like that pretty silly, with the fairly poor acting and script.I haven't seen every film starring Tim Allen, but looking through his credits, it appears that he hasn't had the greatest career in Hollywood history. While The Santa Clause has clearly been well received in comparison to some of his other films, better family Christmas flicks have been made. I'm sure there are films of this kind with equal entertainment value for kids and adults, but I can't say The Santa Clause is a very good example. It may not be strictly for kids (it would probably have a lower IMDb rating than 6.0\/10 if it was), but more for kids than for adults, no doubt about that. Watching it shortly before Christmas, it didn't really put me in the spirit, which was not the case when I saw it years ago.

My second viewing of Ran, and the one which made me acknowledge just how much of an auteur Akira Kurosawa was. I have seen numerous films from the director and literally all of them are essential viewing, yet one of those particular essentials is undoubtedly the director's concluding, 1985 epic. Set on the foundations of William Shakespeare's King Lear and produced on a &#150;remarkably large by Japanese standards at the time- $12 million budget, Ran draws corresponding angles between ancient Japanese history and the classic literacy theme of tyranny.Kurosawa's inspiration for the picture is as follows; when I read that three arrows together are invincible, that's not true. I started doubting, and that's when I started thinking the house was prosperous and the sons were courageous. What if this fascinating man had bad sons? Those words describe the general premise of Ran, not just the beginning idea, but the focal-point. Also, the King Lear insight was something which fascinated Kurosawa, as he had always wanted to create a past for the characters in his version of the tale (something he similarly did with Throne of Blood).Beginning with an extended scene set against the expansive and luscious background of Mount Aso -during the historic period of Feudal Japan- and ending in full-scale war. This contrast depicts how easily broken a peace can be, and the escalating tension slowly builds until the land's ageing Great Lord flees his own land to avoid his children's bitter quarrelling. Almost all the characters in the film are after some sort of power; the Lord recognises the yearning his own family have to take the land from him and expresses his disgust towards their selfishness, gluttony, deceptiveness and disrespectful nature. Yet the youngest son observes the evil taking place and attempts to rescue his father from the wrath of his deceitful brothers. Keep in mind; this is based on a Shakespearian tale, so tragedy is always inevitable.Ever since its release, Ran has garnered practically 100% unanimous praise and is often denounced as a modern masterpiece, along with the previous and far less polished work, Kagemusha (Kurosawa called it a dress rehearsal for Ran). There is something about the to-be classic which &#150;for me personally- offers more satisfaction than any other picture by the Japanese auteur. Many would argue that the film is not as entertaining as Kurosawa's '50s and '60s outings, such as Yojimbo and Seven Samurai, but I would disagree, as much as I adore such classics. In retrospect, nearly every finished Kurosawa product was and continues to remain a great film, if not a masterpiece. Only a collected minority of directors have ever held such unmatched stability.The symbolic use of individually coloured clothing accentuates the emotions of each character; primary colours, yellow, red, blue and white are worn by the principal characters at the start of the piece. Heavy weight is pressed on conveying four predominant and reoccurring themes; turmoil, age, nihilism and warfare. The violence obviously existed throughout the Lord's reign, as an increased inner thirst (predominantly from his children) for control had been looming over the elderly Lord each day he grew older. Kurosawa is said to of intentionally made the chaos displayed a metaphor for an apocalypse of modern nuclear warfare. Well, it sure works.More than anything else, Kurosawa proved his ability to craft films which were in touch with contemporary cinema, but still included all the elements which develop a classic. Without hesitation I would cite Ran as the film which employs the finest use of long-shot cinematography. This is a mere sampling of my feelings towards the technicalities, let alone the film as a whole. Eruptions of unqualified chaos have never been so intoxicating.

In fact for years, it was one of my top 5 favorite films. And yeah, I still like it. There's flying cars, Rachel...And then there's all that fog.But after all these years, i do see there are holes here and there, and most obviously, the story is thinner than paper.Make no mistake, the cinematography, the atmosphere, the sheer cinematics of it all are still powerful. Blade Runner is an extremely charismatic film. More than anything, it is just so dang beautiful to look at. The story on the other hand, is less pretty. Though the themes of the film are there, mostly thanks to Philip K. Dick's original source material. But so much work was spent on the look of the film, the characters are clearly an afterthought. There is such an underdeveloped set of characters and story, I'm not sure anything actually even happens in Blade Runner that is worth....well....happening. The android\/Deckard undercurrent is there, but it seems thin. It feels thin. It is thin. Now Apocalypse Now ran into similar problems, but there was so much subtext with the material and so much interaction with the characters, there still was some narrative drive. Blade Runner struggles to engage me these days. The look of a film can be a major character just as an actor can be. But I don't think it may be a great movie because of that alone. This ain't 2001. If Blade Runner had a further developed character set, aside from Rutgar Hauer's wonderful Batty, there would be a monolithic masterwork here. Instead, we have an amazing exercise in style and nothing more.I am a professional photographer. I know light. Its my job to do so. I can tell an extremely talented man in the way of Jordan Cronenweth shaped the signature look of Blade Runner with Ridley Scott. Those shafts of light coming from nowhere have so much visual power. So on that basis alone, thin plot and characters aside, Blade Runner is still quite good at what it is, once you settle on that.My feelings about Blade Runner are similar as my feelings for some of the more beautiful women I have been with. I love the film when I see it, but I don't think about it all when I'm not watching it. The only thing left is a fog.

Blade Runner is an extremely charismatic film. More than anything, it is just so dang beautiful to look at. The story on the other hand, is less pretty. Though the themes of the film are there, mostly thanks to Philip K. Dick's original source material. But so much work was spent on the look of the film, the characters are clearly an afterthought. There is such an underdeveloped set of characters and story, I'm not sure anything actually even happens in Blade Runner that is worth....well....happening. The android\/Deckard undercurrent is there, but it seems thin. It feels thin. It is thin. Now Apocalypse Now ran into similar problems, but there was so much subtext with the material and so much interaction with the characters, there still was some narrative drive. Blade Runner struggles to engage me these days. The look of a film can be a major character just as an actor can be. But I don't think it may be a great movie because of that alone. This ain't 2001. If Blade Runner had a further developed character set, aside from Rutgar Hauer's wonderful Batty, there would be a monolithic masterwork here. Instead, we have an amazing exercise in style and nothing more.I am a professional photographer. I know light. Its my job to do so. I can tell an extremely talented man in the way of Jordan Cronenweth shaped the signature look of Blade Runner with Ridley Scott. Those shafts of light coming from nowhere have so much visual power. So on that basis alone, thin plot and characters aside, Blade Runner is still quite good at what it is, once you settle on that.My feelings about Blade Runner are similar as my feelings for some of the more beautiful women I have been with.

He's been promised a position in a factory but when he gets there, he understands that not only his job is taken but also he is left penniless in the town. After spending the night with an ex-prostitute, he kills her ex as a result of defending himself. William Blake then tries to escape from punishment with the help of an Indian named Nobody, but gets killed in the end.Setting Time the 2nd half of the 19th century Place A town called Machine in the West. Social Class The majority of people in the town of Machine are illiterate, uncivilized hunters and workers, while William Blake used to be an accountant and doesn't fit in the city.Genre WesternMain Characters 1. William Blake &#149; Physical Characteristics He hasn't got a strong body, showing the fact that he is not a laborer. He is also, in comparison to the other people in the town, peculiarly-dressed. &#149; Psychological Characteristics Inflexible, shocked and not adaptable &#149; Other Characteristics He is 30ish, and due to the previous place he was living in, he expects to see a rather civilized town with kind people but what he sees is completely different. 2. Nobody&#149; Physical Characteristics He has got a muscular, strong physique. &#149; Psychological Characteristics He is very well-traveled and has gained a sort of calmness which looks very strange to William Blake. He also has got a sacred vision. &#149; Other Characteristics When he was a child, he is kidnapped and taken to England where he is educated. He escapes from England by the inspiration he gets from reading the poems of a poet called William Blake. He mistakenly thinks that his companion is the real William Blake and tells him that he must be dead (by telling him, You're a dead man, then.) Besides, he is astonished that Blake cannot remember any of his poetry.VocabularyThe words that are repeatedly used in the film are William Blake, Nobody, dead man, tobacco and gun. William Blake William Blake (1757-1827) was an English romantic poet who was considered odd even among the other romantic poets. Here you see that William Blake in the film was considered odd by other people. But what this character mostly represents is the ideal thoughts the Pilgrims had when they came to America. They wanted to build a city upon a hill, a utopia but what their descendants built is a dystopia, a mere scene of slaughter. This idea is well reflected in Nobody's remark to William Blake Your poetry will now be written with blood.Nobody The film starts with this sentence It is preferable not to travel with a dead man. Now, let's change this sentence to Nobody likes to travel with a dead man. Makes sense, doesn't it? Nobody does like to travel with a dead man (William Blake) because they have one important thing in common They are outcasts. Blake is trying to get away with murder while Nobody is living alone because his tribe didn't accept him. After escaping from England, he got back to his tribe and told his people about the extraordinary things he saw but nobody believed him and they named him Exaybachay meaning He who talks loud, saying nothing. But he prefers to be called Nobody.Dead Man Dead man can have two meanings the superficial one is what Nobody told William Blake. Because Blake, the poet, was dead by that time Nobody calls Blake a dead man. The in-depth meaning is that if you are followed in the USA by anyone, there is clearly no possibility of escape and you are automatically turned into a dead man. Even if you are alive, you cannot live with your true identity. Isn't this situation like being dead in fact?Two other words that are repeated throughout the film are tobacco and gun. If you are an American, you must have both of these. The only person who doesn't have these two is William Blake. However, by the end of the film, both of them are accompanying him. Everybody keeps asking him whether he's got tobacco or not and he simply says that he does not smoke. The response Thel (the ex-prostitute) gives him when he asks why she keeps a gun is really thought-provoking. She honestly says Because this is America.ConclusionThis English proverb gives a very good image of what this film is about The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Although the Founding Fathers wanted to do good in the continent, the only thing their descendants are doing by the end of the film is killing. The new generations have forgotten all those high values. They cannot remember any of those ideals just like William Blake cannot remember any of his poetry. What is very moving in the end of the film is the part in which Nobody is preparing Blake's canoe to be sent on water and Blake still cannot believe that he is a dead man. He still thinks he's getting back to Cleveland. There's also another similarity here between Blake the poet and Blake in the film. The former died largely unknown, now if we take this fact into account that both Nobody and that white murderer are killed in the end of the film, it is unknown to the public what happened to William Blake. This is again revealing the fact that nobody exactly knows what happened to the ideals the Puritans had when they came to this continent.

I absolutely love this movie today as much as I did when I was six years old. I look forward every year around Christmas for it to be on TV, and I periodically during the year still watch my video tape. I love Shirley Temple and love all of her movies but this one to me is the absolute best. It takes you to a time when life and people were very different. I love the scenes in the Alps with the grandfather. I love the story, Heidi was just what the grandfather needed to make him realize that he was not alone and there was no need to shut himself off from the world even though his only son was no longer in it.

Produced by David O. Selznick, who later brought forth such literary works as David COPPERFIELD and A TALE OF TWO CITIES (MGM, 1935) to the screen, LITTLE WOMEN demonstrates to the highest degree on how carefully constructed these movies were made and the way its leading players have brought these storybook characters to life.Set during the Civil War years, the story revolves around the March family of Concord, Massachusetts. The plot development starts with the introduction of its individual members Marmee (Spring Byington), a loving wife and mother who does all she can to keep her family together while her husband (Samuel S. Hinds) is off to war; Josephine, better known as Jo (Katharine Hepburn), a long haired, outspoken tomboy with a catch phrase, Christopher Columbus!, whose ambition is to become famous novelist; Amy (Joan Bennett), a student in a school for girls, is cute, selfish, and a sketching artist; Margaret, or Meg (Frances Dee), a refined but envious girl working as a nursery governess; Beth (Jean Parker), the youngest of the sisters, is sweet, shy and a musically inclined piano player of classical pieces; and Aunt March (Edna May Oliver), an rich old spinster who's just as headstrong as her niece, Jo. The March family live next door to Mr. Laurence (Henry Stephenson), a gruff but kindly old gentleman, whose grandson, Laurie (Douglass Montgomery), becomes Jo's first love. Over the years the girls mature, finding new interests and beaus. Laurie returns home from college finding Jo's feelings towards him have changed; Meg finds love and marries John Brooke (John Lodge), a sophisticated gentleman; Amy matures and falls in love with Laurie; while Beth becomes the center of a crisis when falling ill with scarlet fever. As for Jo, she moves to a boarding house in New York City where she encounters Fritz Bhaer (Paul Lukas), a kindly professor who encourages her writing ability.While it's impossible to recapture every page of Little Women to the screen, screenwriters Sarah Y. Mason and Victor Heerman successfully abridged many of the key elements taken from various chapters, with a few alterations, into playable length of 116 minutes. Previously filmed during the silent era (1918) and remade several times thereafter (1949 for MGM; 1978 television movie; and 1994 Columbia theatrical adaptation), this 1933 carnation remains one of the perennial favorites of all time, and it's easy to see why. Full of nostalgic touches, from its opening credits with a silent movie feel, authentic costumes and hair styles that capture the era, George Cukor's masterful direction with taste and skill brings forth winning performances by entire cast, especially Katharine Hepburn, in a role she was born to play. Although Hepburn's Jo is tough as well as confident, her biggest fear is letting go of her childhood, wanting things to remain as they are, continuing to have those carefree happy times with her sisters. She realizes how impossible it is after Meg, the eldest, marries to have a family of her own. (We can't be children forever.) Joan Bennett also does a commendable job transforming from child-like schoolgirl to mature young lady; and Spring Byington, best known for her lovable comedic characters in latter years, in her movie debut and one of her few opportunities on screen as a serious actress. Last but not least is the memorable Max Steiner underscore.When presented to commercial television during the Christmas season from the 1960s to 70s, all copies in circulation were shorter 107 minute prints. Aside from the Selznick International trademark in place of the original RKO Radio logo, the opening ten minute segment was missing, starting the story with Beth greeting her three sisters at the front door as they come in from the cold.

But despite his calm, quiet appearance, Mark finds joy in murdering women, while filming the horrible deed. When he becomes involved with a woman for the first time, she begins to suspect that something isn't all quite right... and despite her attempts to help him, Mark continues murdering innocent body doubles on his latest film project with the spear-ended leg of his tripod camera.With its retro-style and overall bizarre story, Peeping Tom is an oddball little British thriller that seems to have slipped through the cracks of cinema and hasn't been seen by many. Notoriously controversial and apparently banned, the themes in this film, primarily being voyeurism and murder, are rather heavy, and were especially so for the time it was made. The movie begins with quite a punch-in-the- gut, with a disturbing murder of a prostitute from the killer's camera lens point-of-view. The opening sets the mood for the rest of the film, and I thought the film sustained tension very well, managing to be creative at the same time.There's something about a man obsessed with murdering beautifully-clad women that is extremely sinister, much less filming the crimes, which takes it to an even more disturbing level. The mixed themes of voyeurism, obsession, and murderous impulses is thrown together nicely in the script, and Boehm plays the part extremely well, being reserved and quiet, but appropriately creepy and evoking that feeling that something isn't quite right with him. His character, and the fact that Peeping Tom was released in 1960 as well, is probably what has lead to so many comparisons between this and Hitchock's Psycho. While they do have their similarities, I see Psycho and Peeping Tom as two quite different movies.The main difference is that Peeping Tom focuses mostly from the psychopath's point of view, and more insight is given into his life and disturbing childhood throughout the film's duration, rather than the villain's psyche being wrapped up by a monologue as in Psycho. In that respect, I find Peeping Tom to be a stronger film because the audience can sympathize with the character much more. Both films have their strong and weak points, but it is safe to say that if there ever was a British Psycho, it was most definitely this movie, although I see them as quite different films. My only real complaint with this movie would be that it seems to drag its heels a few times, but all things considered, it is a satisfying horror filmOverall, Peeping Tom is a far above-average psycho-thriller that has managed to sustain its disturbing nature for over forty years. There are quite a few chilling scenes, and Carl Boehm's portrayal of the psychotic photographer is spot-on. If you are a fan of Hitchock's Psycho, it's safe to say you'll likely enjoy this movie, if not more than Psycho.

If you are a fan of Hitchock's Psycho, it's safe to say you'll likely enjoy this movie, if not more than Psycho. As for myself, I cannot decide between the two, but I can say that both are very excellent and important horror pieces. 8\/10, pushing a 9.

In this terrible sequel, the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the Federation that ambassadors representing Earth, Romulus and Kronos (the Klingon home world) have been kidnapped by a renegade Vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier. There, he hopes to find God. Using mysticism and bad writing, he persuades many of the senior officers of the Enterprise to betray Kirk and get a hold of the ship. They do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god-like alien. This one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin. At the core is a good idea that is never really developed. The plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before. It is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco. The action scenes don't have the suspense of Wrath of Kahn, the philosophy is boring, and the humor is stale. Now I will focus most of my anger on William Shatner. When he takes the director's chair, the ego gets bigger. Most of the focus is on him, Spock, and McCoy, but does not give the others enough to do. Moreover, whereas Shatner is usually guilty of over-acting in previous movies and television spots, he is just plain bad in this one. Now Kirk is reckless, a practical jokers, and silly. One of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song, Row Row Row your Boat in a round by a campfire. In any case, this is the worst of the Star Trek franchise. I should have given it three out of ten instead of five.
