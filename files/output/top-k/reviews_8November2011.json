That being said, after viewing this original, and obviously much better version, it is safe to say that Hitchcock would roll over in his grave if he could see what his work had become. This film,(the original) is a stunning piece of visual and visceral beauty. It deals with a myriad of issues that affect the human condition, namely greed, love,psychosis, and fear, just to name a few. This film, more than being a first rate horror movie, is at its core, a story about people. Granted, in this instance, we are talking about some truly screwed up people, but people none the less. The film had a gritty, intense feeling, yet a smooth and refined look. Those two contrasting elements went a long way to truly sucking the viewer into what he or she was watching. Additionally, the music was downright eerie; this was so much the case that when I was viewing the movie at home, I paused it to turn on more lights in my house. That music just had some supernatural way of sending chills down my spine. For the characters themselves, Perkind does what one could expect him to do when tasked with such a mentally taxing role, he shines. Perkins plays the part of Norman Bates very well, as does he Norman's mother. Janet Leigh also brings a strong presence to the screen in her role of the misguided heroine. If I had one major critique of this film, it would be that it ended almost too abruptly. There is this slow creeping buildup to the action, to Bates having a showdown at the climax, and then, poof, its over. Norman is jail, clearly still crazy, and thats that. I would have liked to have seen a little more in that realm. Understandably, Hitchcock was a particular man who believed in less being more, but I feel that way all the same. In regards to Hitchcock, not much needs to really be said. This film is cinematic genius that has yet to be rivaled in terms of cinematography and overall mis-en-scene. Everything is modern, yet still very creepy. That is an especially nice touch. So in summation, Hitchcock and his cast delivered a stellar film that I would definitely recommend to any fan of horror films.

This movie was met with much disappointment, and I think grew on viewers as time went on. Some movies don't do well at the box office but then eventually become cult classics. We see a completely different type of Superman movie in the 3rd installment than the others, and this one really stands on it's own. Unlike Superman 1 and 2 that started out very large and epic in scale from the beginning of the opening titles, to the space scenes, the planet Krypton exploding, the 3 criminals in space, etc. Superman III starts out very small, and builds to an exciting battle between Superman and Clark in the junkyard and then eventually the ultimate showdown with the Super Computer in the end. We see a completely different side of Clark Kent in this movie. His character has drifted away from the normal bumping into walls, nervous, nerdy, clumsy and awkward Clark that we are all use to. He scaled back a bit of the physical comedy. I read in an interview with Chris Reeve that he felt the audience would be tired of this, and to show a different side of him. In addition if you remember in the first movie when Clark was living in Smallville he didn't have that awkward personality. It was part of his made up disguise when he arrived in Metropolis. So when he goes back to Smallville we see him act normal. We also see that Clark meets up with High School friend Lana Lang when he goes to his H.S. reunion. He and Lana seem to hit it off and there is a definite attraction, however it never goes past friendship, and I think that's important. Superman had his one shot at romance and his one true love Lois Lane, and now that it's over I think it was important to not show Superman jumping from bed to bed. I think it was also refreshing to see someone else other than Lex Luther and the three Kryptonians be the villain. In this case, Ross Webster, A Millionaire business man who is use to getting his way, played very well by Robert Vaughn and his evil sister Vera helping him along. We see a side of Superman that we never thought we would see come out after the Kryptonite alters his personality. Christopher Reeve demonstrates more than ever how good an actor he is to be able to play not 1, not 2 but 3 different personalities. The junkyard scene in my opinion was the best part of the entire movie. Now you add the innocent but always spontaneous and funny Richard Pryor to the cast and I think it made for a great mix of characters. In addition, I think this movie had some of the best flying scenes in any of the four movies, with many of them not being done with a Blue screen, but mostly by crane and harness. Chris just masters the take offs and landings like nobody else can. All in all this is one of those movies where you can check your daily problems at the door for 2 hours, and really be entertained and I think it brought Superman back to the comic strip a bit. I think if you watch this movie again or maybe for the first time you will realize just how good it is.

Cunningham. And depending on one's idiosyncratic tastes and aesthetics, that will be either a good thing or a bad thing when watching Part 2. And it is my sad duty to report that I stand with the latter.Because Part 2 is really more of what we got the first time around alarming dehumanization (especially toward the female half of the human race), poorly-staged acts of gory violence, shoddy performances, and (for me) absolute boredom, mixed with bursts of anger, from beginning to end. As it opens, it is right after the final events of the first one. The sole surviving counselor from the first movie (Adrienne King) is trying to cope away from home, and her parents, when she gets the creepy sensation that she is not alone (in the house, cabin, motel? I'm really not sure what it was). The camera lingers on her in a Hitchcockian way and just when she feels safe, a figure grabs her and shoves a blade to the hilt in her skull.And then we know that it was perhaps the believed-drowned boy Jason Voorhees did not die after all, saw his mother get beheaded, came back for revenge, and is, I guess to carry on his mother's name, cut the throats of anybody who comes back to where they thought he had died and where she *did* die.Cut to our new cast of characters as they head back to Crystal Lake, the 'haunted' summer camp where throats and faces were slit the time before. From there, it's just more of the same. Would-be drives of suspense in the first act along with angering scenes of sex and drug-doing between the teens, some random killings in the second, and lots of close calls utterly devoid of excitement in the third right up till another open-window of an ending, leaving plenty of room for Part III and the many others that followed.The acting is amateurish, but then again I cannot imagine the actors had much fun being slapped around, covered with cartoonishly-lit fake blood, splattered with mud, undressed, and photographed in lewd manners so that the audience may take some joy in seeing them slaughtered. The only big difference the second time around is a decrease in directing quality. The work of Sean S.

Everything aspect of this film is top notch. The fact that it is a musical that plays on the first sound films being released and the whole slew of trouble that ensued makes it even better. This brings me to my next point, humor. This film is genuinely funny, and not just as a student, but as a viewer as well. The writing is sharp and witty, albeit a bit sentimental for my taste. From the films opening scene on the red carpet, as a viewer there is no mistaking that this movie is going to be great. Gene Kelly's acting, singing, and of course dancing, is superb to say the least, and is made even better by the cast around him. The music in the film was a bit slow for my taste, but it is understandable considering this film is supposed to be set in the 1920's. I feel as though there is not much I can say that has not been said already by many others about what a high caliber film this is. Jean Hagen as the nasally and pompous Lina Lemont made me want to cringe every time she entered the scene. While I understand that it is a movie, nonetheless, I can't imagine that role did not stick with her for a while. What I mean to say is, I'm sure that people berated her on the street because of her performance. But I digress.. The overall feel, or mis-en-scene of the film is great, from the costumes to the set and production design, all the way down to the minor details like the microphones in the flower pot. It just goes to show that something as simple as sound in films, which assuredly we all take for granted every day, had at best, rocky beginnings to get to the point where it is today. Not to sound overly cliché, but this film is a timeless classic that I would highly recommend to others.

From the films opening scene on the red carpet, as a viewer there is no mistaking that this movie is going to be great. Gene Kelly's acting, singing, and of course dancing, is superb to say the least, and is made even better by the cast around him. The music in the film was a bit slow for my taste, but it is understandable considering this film is supposed to be set in the 1920's. I feel as though there is not much I can say that has not been said already by many others about what a high caliber film this is. Jean Hagen as the nasally and pompous Lina Lemont made me want to cringe every time she entered the scene. While I understand that it is a movie, nonetheless, I can't imagine that role did not stick with her for a while. What I mean to say is, I'm sure that people berated her on the street because of her performance. But I digress.. The overall feel, or mis-en-scene of the film is great, from the costumes to the set and production design, all the way down to the minor details like the microphones in the flower pot. It just goes to show that something as simple as sound in films, which assuredly we all take for granted every day, had at best, rocky beginnings to get to the point where it is today. Not to sound overly cliché, but this film is a timeless classic that I would highly recommend to others.

Here is my analysis. After the film Batman Returns Came out in 1992 people were really shocked that the movie was so dark that they said it should have either some of the violence should have been taken out or make the film Rated R. So now the people who said they wanted a darker Batman now want a much more Family Friendly Batman. But this is a fun film to watch.The film is about Batman\/Bruce Wayne now played by Val Kilmer has now 2 new villains Harvey Dent\/Two Face played by Tommy Lee Jones who had his face burned in acid and half of his face is burnt and wants to dump acid on everyone to make everyone like him so he doesn't feel like outcast. The second villain is Dr. Edward Nygma\/The Riddler played by Jim Carrey who becomes insane and wants to join Two Face to take down Batman. This is also the first film to introduce Batmans Sidekick Robin played by Chris O'Donnell who is a misfit that wants to join Batman to take down Two Face because Two Face killed Robins parents.In my opinion this is one of the better Batman films because of the entertainment value. I think that Val Kilmer was quite a nice choice to play Batman and the introduction of Robin as nice. I liked how they waited until later on to put Robin in the films instead of him being there at minute 1.

Clockers fails, in my opinion, because the film's premise is lacking substance to begin with; the story is lackluster to the max. On top of this, where the film had its opportunities to reel in the audience emotionally, it instead dropped the ball. Moments where energy, tension, and suspense were supposed to effused were disappointingly overridden with anticlimactic slumps in action. The choking scene in the car as well as when Mekhi is being beat up in the park, with their odd selection of music, seem unfulfilled in their potential to capitalize on emotional appeal.I will say the denouement is shot with expert precision. Lee's patented cinematographic maneuver, the double dolly, is on full display. Moreover, his use of low-key lighting in some specific scenes that illustrate the proliferation of drugs inside the projects are done in a professionally haunting manor. Unfortunately, these instances are rare, overshadowed by the weak portions previously discussed.With regards to Lee's film style in Clockers, I like to point out two of his techniques that I find terribly annoying 1) Those stupid circling gliding shots around characters when they are talking. 2) His persistent use of intense music to compliment serious(at least Lee thinks they must be) scenes. When put together, these two devices serve to create the ultimate exaggeration of the weight a scene carries in this film. Doing a flashy gliding pan across the park accompanied by pounding sound while Tyrone's mother yells at Mekhi and his boys about his haircut is a little excessive. Instead, I think Clocker's would benefit from a greater variation in the levels of stress and emotion we experience in each scene. This way, when the film actually does come to a TRULY significant moment, the audience will become more invested in the action.P.S.

Their lack of street smarts and schoolyard antics play with a lovable innocence and, more importantly, a self-awareness. It's clear that although the film is basically about two guys horsing around, the talents behind it were doing anything but.The '90s had a very tough time shaking the '80s, at least as played in the movies, and Wayne's World captures this awkward transition whether intentionally or not. Mike Myers and then-SNL writers Bonnie and Terry Turner wrote a movie that operated in a very forward-thinking fashion at the time but was trapped in a sea of '80s clichés and long-haired metal rockers. If the point was in fact to poke fun at those still clinging to the age of excellence, consider it received.Wayne (Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey) are two dudes living with their respective parents who host a public-access television show in Wayne's basement called Wayne's World. When Benjamin, a sleazy TV executive (Rob Lowe), flashes money and promises of fame their way, they sell out without realizing it, and when Benjamin starts making a play for Wayne's new babe, Cassandra (Tia Carrere), he and Garth must learn how to stand up for themselves.Myers and Carvey are held responsible for making this unexciting premise entertaining. Their ability to both convincingly play and make fun of their characters, sometimes simultaneously, has few rivals. Carvey in particular makes Garth one of the most lovable characters in a comedy of this kind. Garth's intelligence is matched only by his naivete and you can see both in Carvey's performance at all times. Wayne and Garth's fondness of innuendo also captures that hybrid of witty word play and complete immaturity that makes the humor tick.The magic of Wanye's World stems from being an everyman's comedy. The way Wayne and Garth (especially Garth) talk to the camera as if they've simply taken a camcorder to their insignificant but fun-filled lives makes them relatable dudes and establishes that the movie's humor is not manufactured to make us laugh, rather it invites us in for a shared comedy experience that is not above any viewer. Few comedies have done anything similar and been funny; 90 percent of them rely on contrived jokes and situations. The breaking of the fourth wall (to use the professional term not fitting of a movie like this) and the awareness of Myers and Carvey really sell us on this idea.In truth, only a few moments of Wayne's World have laugh-out-loud potential, but that's fine. It doesn't need it and it doesn't ask for it. And for a movie with a completely bare plot that does enough to give its characters something to do, it still works somehow thanks to the way it takes jabs at those very conventions. That's probably why 20 years later, it's just as easy to watch this movie and enjoy it even if you didn't sit down with the intent of really watching it.

If the point was in fact to poke fun at those still clinging to the age of excellence, consider it received.Wayne (Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey) are two dudes living with their respective parents who host a public-access television show in Wayne's basement called Wayne's World. When Benjamin, a sleazy TV executive (Rob Lowe), flashes money and promises of fame their way, they sell out without realizing it, and when Benjamin starts making a play for Wayne's new babe, Cassandra (Tia Carrere), he and Garth must learn how to stand up for themselves.Myers and Carvey are held responsible for making this unexciting premise entertaining. Their ability to both convincingly play and make fun of their characters, sometimes simultaneously, has few rivals. Carvey in particular makes Garth one of the most lovable characters in a comedy of this kind. Garth's intelligence is matched only by his naivete and you can see both in Carvey's performance at all times. Wayne and Garth's fondness of innuendo also captures that hybrid of witty word play and complete immaturity that makes the humor tick.The magic of Wanye's World stems from being an everyman's comedy. The way Wayne and Garth (especially Garth) talk to the camera as if they've simply taken a camcorder to their insignificant but fun-filled lives makes them relatable dudes and establishes that the movie's humor is not manufactured to make us laugh, rather it invites us in for a shared comedy experience that is not above any viewer. Few comedies have done anything similar and been funny; 90 percent of them rely on contrived jokes and situations. The breaking of the fourth wall (to use the professional term not fitting of a movie like this) and the awareness of Myers and Carvey really sell us on this idea.In truth, only a few moments of Wayne's World have laugh-out-loud potential, but that's fine. It doesn't need it and it doesn't ask for it. And for a movie with a completely bare plot that does enough to give its characters something to do, it still works somehow thanks to the way it takes jabs at those very conventions. That's probably why 20 years later, it's just as easy to watch this movie and enjoy it even if you didn't sit down with the intent of really watching it.

While investigating an energy ribbon, James Kirk is killed. Seven decades later, Picard must stop Saron, a man so hell-bent on getting back into the said ribbon which is actually a temporal window into any point in history that the person wants to go. But to get back, Saron must destroy planetary stars in different sectors to alter the gravimetric forces in a sector to move the ribbon where he wants to go. A side effect (and i use the term lightly) of the destruction of these stars is a shock wave which destroys everything in a star system (ships, stations, planets, etc). Picard must stop him or 230 million people will die as a result, not including his own crew.(SPOILER ALERT!) if this movie guide interests you at all, read no further.The destruction of the Enterprise is really dramatic, gripping, and one hell of a ride. I can honestly say that most of the bad reviews for this movie are a direct result of people who are angry that Enterprise is destroyed, or for the fact that the James Kirk finally dies. They don't understand that this is a send off, and that this movie is where EVERYTHING changes.I suspect that some find this movie boring.Some may complain about the holes in the story line.But the movie itself is a lot better than Insurecction.Over all...9\/10. it does have its flaws but overall it's worth a watch.
