There are people scratching their heads left and right, arguing about whether Donnie Darko is a cult film, an art film, a horror movie, a teen-angst movie, a fantasy, a self-important, overrated piece of crap, an underrated classic, blah, blah, blah, and, etc., and etc. (I know this very well, I've found myself to be one of them. > ). Anyhoo, regardless of whether anyone can pigeonhole this movie or no (especially the jerks out there who call any fan of this movie an idiot and a sucker), this is a great movie. If you have to categorize it and slap on a label on it, why don't we say it's almost everything? This film is full of moving emotional intensity, regardless of genre association or whatever else. It has a lot of truthful things to say, and, despite what some think, it's no teenybopper flick either. The sign of angst is not illustrated in this film by Donnie (played DAMN WELL by Jake Gyllenhaal) looking out from under hair, okay? That's the sign of someone on the verge of complete madness! Get it right! And that one feature on its own does not illustrate this alone, either, because this is well-written, well-acted, and all-around WELL-MADE. If it hurts your head to figure out what's underneath it all, let your mind go and watch it as a MOVIE. Chances are you'll still enjoy it, if you're not looking for a reason to condemn it. This is one of the most moving, entertaining, and deep films to come out during the past few years, and it is one of the few non-schlock movies of recent times that I actually give more than a flying squirrel's ass about. Some say there's nothing deep and thoughtful about this. Again, people get hung up on specifics. Anyone who knows what it's like to be a teenager in the US should see that this movie has depth, especially since it's not one of those Heathers rip-offs. As far as Frank the bunny rabbit, doesn't anyone see that this character is not from the far-off future? Who in the HELL came up with that one? This guy looks to me like he has very much in common with Donnie. I think he is a tortured, young artist who stumbled upon the truth in an unexplained way. (And, believe me, with many movies, including this one, some explanations are BETTER LEFT UNEXPLAINED.) I think that, somehow, he saw something in Donnie that was very important to him, so he wanted to pass his knowledge on to Donnie. Does it make sense that way? Well, this movie is mainly about very unstable people and their personal demons. When the characters you care about are unstable, the movie is unstable, as well as the message. So it will make sense to some, but not everyone. In any case, it certainly makes more since than Frank being from the year 3000, or some garbage like that! Anyway, I love this film, even as I understand that it simultaneously begs to be read into and isn't easily read into at all. Regardless, Donnie Darko is one of the best movies ever made, and no one should be called a moron for enjoying it.

I watched the film twice in the same day, I thought it was so good. I remember thinking Spawn was the coolest superhero ever and I still do. But with the release of Blade, X-Men and Spiderman, Spawn is no longer the best superhero movie. But it's very different and entertaining.Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) is a highly skilled assassin\/covert-op for A-6. An organization run by the insane Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen). Simmons is sent out to assassinate various political figures for reasons which are pretty much clouded to him. Well, Wynn keeps them clouded and Simmons misinformed, so that he'll think that he's one of the good guys, when he is in fact not. But Simmons is beginning to catch on and wants out. Wynn, however, manages to convince Simmons to take one last mission.During this mission however, Wynn betrays Simmons and kill him. Up to this point, the story has sounded quite normal right? It could be a sequel to Sniper or something. But here is where the twist begins. When Simmons is killed, he is sent to hell. And there he promises the devil, Malbolgia, to do his dirty work on earth and many other things. The plot is complicated to explain, but not to comprehend. While watching the movie, you understand it without problems.There are quite a few characters in this film that occur throughout the movie. Almost all of them are underdeveloped, but we still get to like some of them. The most memorable one being The Clown, played by John Leguizamo. The Clown appears once Al Simmons\/Spawn is sent back to Earth and explains this and that to Spawn about what has happened to him and what is to come. Throughout the film he manipulates Spawn to do things Hells way, even if that's not quite what Spawn wants too since he is a good guy at heart.The Clown cracks some hilarious lines throughout the film. I kept bursting into laughed almost once every scene in which the Clown occurred. Leguizamo plays him splendidly and turns him into one of the funniest characters ever. Other characters are not so likable or enjoying tho. Most of the acting is actually downright bad. Martin Sheen, even though he is a seasoned vetera, does not really give a very good performance, but it holds up in a superhero film. Michael Jai White is not Oscar material either, but I have trouble imagining anyone else in the role of Spawn. He does his job well, even if it's not great. Most other actors in the film, except for perhaps Nicol Williamson, deliver plain or just flat out bad performances however.The CGI, which this film relies heavily upon, is splendid sometimes and bad some other times. In the Earth scenes, where most of the CGI is used to display Spawn's armor, the CGI is great. Most of it even holds up to this day. But in the Hell scenes, it's quite ridiculous, however. The CGI is really had here. A child could tell you that. But the Hell scenes are few and far apart and they get the story along. So at least they are entertaining.The action scenes are quite different, really. Sometimes they rely on Gun action as Al Simmons\/Spawn boost various kinds of machine guns to clear out rooms or such. Come to think of it, those scenes do make me think of Punisher, however they are not nearly as bad. The best action scenes are by far when Spawn uses his armor to fight his foes, I can tell you that.So, the bottom line is This film is very entertaining, but lacks in some fields. If you want a deep intellectual movie, look somewhere else. If you want a good action flick, take a peek here.

The first time I saw it, it was completely over my head, but as with many films, time has shown me things I could have never understood at such a young age. Let me just say this movie is good. That's right, I know it has received a lot of negative feedback and sarcasm, but it is a good movie. I do agree there is a few minor plot holes and some of the acting needed work, but overall it was most enjoyable. I wouldn't rate it as Oscar-worthy because it is apparent that the talented cast and crew were only just beginning to harness their craft. After all, would you hold it against Picasso if his first painting was not a total masterpiece? Vanilla Ice, the self-proclaimed lyrical poet, was stunning as the lead-he has such magnetism for a lead role; if you can't see that then you don't know him, you don't know him at all! It seems as though Vanilla's keen business sense didn't do him justice with this movie, perhaps the timing just wasn't right for people to embrace a film so ahead of its time. On another note, His fame shows us the unfortunate part of living in a disposable society- as Ice proclaims in one of his songs- we have treated him like a dirty diaper-used him one time and then wiped him out. Sure everything was fine when people liked listening to dope raps about living life on the mean streets, wearing neon jackets and silk pants, shaving lightning bolts into our heads and putting globes on our lawns; but after that was old news we left Ice out to melt. What people seem to forget is there is a person under all that glamour-his name is Robert and he is a rap pioneer, a neon god-all the rappers today ain't got an ounce of mack on The Ice!I have heard some talk about a possible DVD release, I say forget that-this needs to be re-released in theaters. I think we are ready. The world has been through so much in the past couple years, and this film will remind us of what really matters- break dancing for your girl and crotch rockets. I also think that Ice needs to get back into acting, I know he is touring right now because he is coming to my city (he's doing small venues-trying to just keep it real-low-key and about the music) but hopefully he will get a chance to look at some scripts while he whisks around the states. I see him in something of a period piece-perhaps a civil war drama. He could shave yankee into his head and his unit could be the only rapping\/break dancing unit on the battlefield.

Despite his efforts to befriend the popular Judy (Natalie Wood) and fit in with her crowd, he gets turned away and must instead befriend the outcast Plato (Sal Mineo). But, Jim is also a nice guy and doesn't mind his company.*here be possible spoilers*One night, on another attempt to fit in and gain respect, Jim engages in what the kids call a chickie race, in which two boys drive stolen cars towards the edge of a cliff and see which one jumps from their car first. However, this race ends tragically when Judy's boyfriend, Buzz (Corey Allen) gets caught inside his car and is killed. Jim still earns no respect for the race, and is still unhappy as he goes back to his heckling parents (Jim Backus and Ann Doran) and his lonely life. Of course this is not how the movie ends, but I won't ruin that for you.REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE is a great movie, and easy to relate to. It's technically a coming of age story, but it's not corny or cheesy in the least. Probably because it was made quite a while ago, and is considered a classic, and does stand the test of time. All of the technical aspects are in good shape--scripting, directing, and casting are all great.And as for the acting... well, what is there to say. I adore James Dean, and he was a brilliant and beautiful actor, but there's nothing I can say that hasn't been said about him before or that would do him justice. The only way to understand his legacy is to see him in action. As for the rest of the cast, everyone is great, namely the other two leads, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo (sadly, both have passed as well as Dean).*here be more possible spoilers*The only flaw I could see in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE is how unrealistic it is in parts. After Buzz is killed, Judy seems to show virtually no emotion about it. We don't even see her crying over the accident. And then, that very same night, she gets together with Jim? She must be one heartless witch if so. However, this seemed pretty inevitable from the beginning, so I can't say much.Aside from that one gripe, I really can't think of anything else bad to say about REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"1 June 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE is that classic story of rebellion that we all know--a boy named Jim Stark (played by the brilliant James Dean) moves to a new town, and has a hard time fitting in with his new schoolmates. Despite his efforts to befriend the popular Judy (Natalie Wood) and fit in with her crowd, he gets turned away and must instead befriend the outcast Plato (Sal Mineo). But, Jim is also a nice guy and doesn't mind his company.*here be possible spoilers*One night, on another attempt to fit in and gain respect, Jim engages in what the kids call a chickie race, in which two boys drive stolen cars towards the edge of a cliff and see which one jumps from their car first. However, this race ends tragically when Judy's boyfriend, Buzz (Corey Allen) gets caught inside his car and is killed. Jim still earns no respect for the race, and is still unhappy as he goes back to his heckling parents (Jim Backus and Ann Doran) and his lonely life. Of course this is not how the movie ends, but I won't ruin that for you.REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE is a great movie, and easy to relate to. It's technically a coming of age story, but it's not corny or cheesy in the least. Probably because it was made quite a while ago, and is considered a classic, and does stand the test of time. All of the technical aspects are in good shape--scripting, directing, and casting are all great.And as for the acting... well, what is there to say. I adore James Dean, and he was a brilliant and beautiful actor, but there's nothing I can say that hasn't been said about him before or that would do him justice. The only way to understand his legacy is to see him in action. As for the rest of the cast, everyone is great, namely the other two leads, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo (sadly, both have passed as well as Dean).*here be more possible spoilers*The only flaw I could see in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE is how unrealistic it is in parts. After Buzz is killed, Judy seems to show virtually no emotion about it. We don't even see her crying over the accident. And then, that very same night, she gets together with Jim? She must be one heartless witch if so. However, this seemed pretty inevitable from the beginning, so I can't say much.Aside from that one gripe, I really can't think of anything else bad to say about REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.

Things were going smoothly for Izzy and this movie, as Izzy is living his dream rocking out with Steel Dragon, with millions of fans now idolizing him ironically as he once idolized the same band a few short years earlier. The movie is now a little over an hour in running time, what will be the conflict for the remaining part of this film? Surprise surprise, Jenifer Aniston (Izzy's girlfriend)decides she isn't cut for her job as Izzy's manager no longer, which also indicates her thoughts on her and Izzy's future. I found the whole second part of this movie predictable and stale. Izzy's girlfriend quits and returns home. Izzy at that time was having the time of his life, his dream became reality, now with his girlfriends departure he decides the Rock and Roll life wasn't meant for him after all, so he returns to his girlfriend and blah blah blah!! I saw the second half of this film coming a mile away, its done so excessively in the average B- movies...Now I ask this question to anyone who reads this if you had your dream handed to you like Izzy did, would you run with it...Or throw it away for any selfish and jealous woman (and beautiful of course) like he did? Their are millions of fish in the sea...Izzy only had one shot at his dream, and he gave it up. Not smart.All in all this movie DID show promise and I particularly enjoyed the first half. I can relate to Whalberg's character because I am too a man with a dream. I just wish the movie would have focused on the dream for once rather then boy meets girl,boy falls in love with girl ,or maybe Hollywood should start showing the world some realistic endings after all for every single marriage there is a divorce. If the film could have steered in the opposite direction in its second half then it would have been much more enjoyable. My opinion of the movie is almost like the movie itself. It shows hope and ambition to be a memorable film as Izzy shows to be the lead singer of Steel Dragon, but in the end the movie sells out and becomes forgettable and ordinary, as Izzy retires from his dream to pursue the so called love of his life.
