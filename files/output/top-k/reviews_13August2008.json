A while back I actually met some Britons in their early twenties who had never heard of it. This troubles me greatly.Terry Gilliam's 1985 dystopian classic is beautifully realised, often hilarious and utterly horrifying, not least because it has turned out to be so prophetic.Fundamentally - and very coherently - this is a film about systems breaking down A dead fly drops into a printer, causing a misprint which leads to a man's mistaken death by torture; heating systems break down, and cannot be repaired because the Central Repairs support system is overstretched; the ubiquitous, massively complex systems of machines, presumably designed to make life easier, invariably go wrong when one or another link breaks down.It is also a film about systems breaking down humanity. With everyone having their own tightly defined role in the overarching bureaucratic systems that control everything, nobody has to take personal responsibility for anything else; mistakes are almost somebody else's problem, and nobody really feels they have the power to change anything. Throughout the film it's therefore difficult to pin much of the blame for any of the things that go wrong on any particular person. Even the head torturer (Michael Palin) gives the impression that he's only getting on with his job, the same as anyone.Almost all of the action of the film is driven by people struggling against these systems of control, whether by fighting back or (more usually) working around them. Our main protagonist, the affable dreamer Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce), is bent on using his access to the Ministry of Information to find out more about the woman he thinks he loves, Jill Layton (Kim Greist), a quest which is complicated by the fact that she is considered an enemy of the state thanks to her efforts to find out what happened to her neighbour, the unfortunate victim of a clerical error. The closest thing we have to a hero in this story is Harry Tuttle, a renegade heating engineer played with much panache and very little restraint by Robert De Niro.This was Gilliam's third non-Python feature, after Jabberwocky and Time Bandits, and it maintains many of the comedy tropes of his earlier work. Although it is hugely over the top, with much of the melodrama played for laughs, the comedy aspects largely just add to the unease of it. This is a world gone utterly mad, but it nevertheless seems disquietingly plausible The built-in unreality means it makes that much more sense when we find a cheerfully absorbed secretary typing up transcripts of hideous torture sounds, or we witness negotiations for a payment plan to cover the cost of someone's own 'interrogation'. How far are we from that sort of world right now? How much closer than we were when Brazil was made? For my money this is more disturbing than any film I've seen marketed as a horror.The story is interspersed with dream sequences, and next to the profound oddness of the reality they interrupt, it ends up increasingly unclear where one ends and the other begins. The dream sequences themselves are gorgeous and unsettling, even if their allegorical relation to the rest of the film veers between brutally unsubtle and rather obscure. Our protagonist flies on Icarus-like wings through fields of billowing clouds, over grim, haunted concrete landscapes, towards his dream woman. As the world throws maddening obstacles in his way, from eruptions of tower blocks to a huge robotic samurai, our dream-Sam valiantly fights his way through them, only to be thwarted again and again. It is in these dream sequences that it becomes most obvious this is a Gilliam film - everything about them could have come straight out of one of his animated Monty Python sequences, rendered with real actors, puppets and the best special effects that 1985 had to offer.The aesthetic of the real-world part of the film is equally striking. Costumes and sets place it some time around the 1930s, with technology perhaps extrapolated from that period in subtly different directions from the ones it actually took. Computer screens are tiny, unsheathed cathode ray tubes with great Fresnel lenses hung in front of them for magnification. Documents are shot from place to place using tubes. Indeed tubes of various sorts are a major motif of the film, prominent ducts snaking across the oppressive monolithic architecture in almost every shot, a visual metaphor for the tangled, high-pressure systems everyone is pushed through.Brazil is obviously a satire, but it also belongs to the tradition of visionary dystopian science fiction. Gilliam's targets are trends which he must have been dismayed to see not just continued but greatly strengthened in the decades since. His conception of humanity's descent into inhumanity has so far proved much closer to the bone than such obvious inspirations as George Orwell's 1984 and Fritz Lang's Metropolis, and right now there is little sign of us making any major collective effort to get off this course.

It is hard to say this is the best war movie, because I find it to be more of a character study and the war involvement is coincidental.

There are so many different aspects of ourselves that we don't even know are there. But there comes a piece of art such as TDH that comes along and touches you personally. This film has taught me that there doesn't have to be a point made across to entertain or enthrall or even relate to you, but simply show yourself. And this is what the characters in this film did, they showed themselves and opened up such dark and mysterious parts of their personalities that becomes all too human. Films like these show us how dysfunctional our society is, and what a complicated world it is we live in.

De Niro gave one of the performances of his life, which isn't his norm to do a roll like this, but he was perfect for it. Streep and Cazale are fine supporters, just not at Walken's level at that time.

Excessively noisy, always packed with people and there will be a fight breaking out at some point during the evening. You wouldn't see that in the UK. You'd get a couple of jocks hogging the pool table, bad music from the jukebox and maybe one or two singers who have had too much to drink - far more civilised that the bar seen in stuff like Coyote Ugly, anyway. Despite its raucous nature, this is actually a fairly inoffensive and deeply predictable rags-to-riches story that is aimed squarely at the teenage girl market that I'm clearly not a part of. Oh dear.Piper Perabo plays Violet, a shy wannabe songwriter growing up in New Jersey but with dreams of moving to New York in order to pursue her dreams. Against the wishes of her father (John Goodman), she moves out and finds herself struggling to make it. As her money dwindles, she takes a bar job at a frankly seedy establishment called Coyote Ugly and is woefully out of her depth. Staffed by sassy women who tease and tantalize their largely male customers, Violet fights the reluctance of the manager Lil (Mario Bello) and her stage fright in order to fit in. Can she overcome her nerves to secure her dreams and succeed in love with the impossibly cute Kevin (Adam Garcia)? There is a lot not to like about Coyote Ugly. The plot is insultingly basic and all too ready to turn on itself for the sake on convenience. Take the moment when Violet auctions off Kevin in order to raise some cash. Up to that point, the bar is full of shouting drunk guys but as soon as the auction starts, it suddenly fills with sex-starved women with money to burn - where did they come from? I personally felt that this was a female fantasy movie - a film where women are the shouty ballsy ones partying hard and living dangerously - and this may be why it didn't ring particularly true to me. The evolution of Violet's character doesn't seem organic at all, as she switches from shy to confident at a moment's notice. However, Perabo rightly leads to cast as she is good as Violet. Goodman also performs well as her father but Garcia does less well, being little more than eye-candy.

Can she overcome her nerves to secure her dreams and succeed in love with the impossibly cute Kevin (Adam Garcia)? There is a lot not to like about Coyote Ugly. The plot is insultingly basic and all too ready to turn on itself for the sake on convenience. Take the moment when Violet auctions off Kevin in order to raise some cash.

It was so refreshing to watch a movie feeling like you were inside the mind of Amelie seeing everything in the vibrant colours as she viewed life with.Amelie is a beautifully realized and uplifting modern day fairy tale that owes much of its irresistible charm to the adorable charisma of its star Audrey Tautou.Amelie is a 2001 French film written and directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Jeunet and Gullance Laurant; the film is a whimsical and somewhat idealised depiction of the contemporary Parisian life. It tells the story of a shy waitress who decides to change the lives of those around her for the better, while struggling with her own isolation. Laurent and Jeunet use a kind of 'magical' realism to give the movie an almost dreamy effect.The atmosphere of the film is also supported by the magnificent music by Yann Tiersen who had composed 19 songs in 15 days for the film. The music continually changes from somehow being joyful to at the same time becoming sad and slow and sometimes fast and exciting. The music supports every moment in the film and becomes a part of the fabulous world of Amelie.Jeunet established the dream like atmosphere by mostly using greens and reds and sometimes adding blues to set the contrast. Sometimes the use of colour gets very obvious; like Amelies apartment for example it's almost completely red, the underground stations are kept in green and the green grocery stores stand out from the grey buildings behind. Also Audrey Tautou (Amelie) mostly wears either bright red or bright green.Besides Jeunet use of colour to bring light in the film, his masterful camera work and few special effects, just adds that touch of fantasy to the movie. For example there is an astonishing high angle shot of Amelie flipping stones on the le canal in Paris. The camera shows a shot of her leaning on a fence, flying above her head then craning to a low angle shot to flipping stones in the direction of the camera. Another fantastic camera shot is seen when Nino is shown falling up the stairs chasing the yet to be discovered repair man. The camera shows the repair man driving off with Nino following close behind. Amelie then enters the picture running after Nino. The camera follows her, then turning around almost 180 degrees around shows her holding Nino's bag that he had just lost. Also when Amelie sits in front of the station we see her in a long shot, the camera dollies in to fly over her head to an over-the-shoulder shot. Some of these camera movements are extremely effective supporting the dream like atmosphere, adding interesting aspects to ordinary actions.The few special effects incorporated in the movie were effectively showing the audience what was happening that could not be seen. Jeunet decided to show the key in Amelies pocket after copying it and bringing the original key back to the grocer's door. Jeunet uses digital effects showing the keys silhouette in a yellow light hidden in Amelies pocket. This technique is also used for showing Amelies heart beat faster and the blind man feeling happy after being guided by Amelie.Amelie is probably the most enjoyable movie I have seen this year, a mix of surreal images and good-natured, quirky charm that's both visually and emotionally intoxicating. Audrey Tautou as Amelie is endearing and effortlessly charming, much like the movie itself. When Amelie turns to the camera and smiles, it's terribly hard not to smile back.

He certainly has changed the way movies are made and perceived but I have to disagree with a lot of people who consider him to be one of the greatest director's of all time. I don't want to anger his fans because they are plentiful and are all ways very passionate about their hero but I think Reservoir Dogs is actually superior to the much more loved Pulp Fiction.Reservoir Dogs is simplicity it's self, it's a robbery and crime film where we don't see any robberies or crimes being committed. I actually kind of liked this, because it highlights Tarantino's terrific dialouge and the stellar performances by the cast. Since we don't get to see this diamond heist, the movie becomes more thrilling psychologically because the viewer is forced to imply much in his head. Don't get me wrong, the film is still gruesome but the thrills come from the aftershocks not the actions like in Tarantino's other flicks. In many ways this helps the character development because it is easy for a criminal to act tough but when they are at hell's door we see the people they really are. The emotions and real personalities under the tough guy attitude are what these characters are. In only one instance does the character not go through a massive change and that character is Mr.Blonde. Blonde is a psychopath down to the bone and this is demonstrated by the infamous ear scene(You'll never be able to listen to the oldies station the same way again).Much is made of the fact that the lead gangster,Joe Cabot, gives every member of his team an alias. Each man ceases to be a man and instead becomes a color. Cabot says that it will help if they are caught so no one can be double crossed, which is really a smart plan but it backfires when it becomes apparent that one of the men is a police informant who tipped off the LAPD before the robbery could be completed. There's a traitor in the mix and these men need some sort of unity if they are to make it out alive.Reservoir Dogs is one of the best told stories captured on film.

You're in for a good time as well as some pure chills and thrills, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, turn down the lights, lock all your doors and windows, and enjoy!

Then again, why expect something conventional from the Coens? The Hudsucker Proxy is a lot like their other films clever, unpredictable and occasionally downright insane. Three good reasons for a re-evaluation.The brothers' first proper comedy since Raising Arizona (though some argue Barton Fink qualifies as humor of the darkest kind) opens on a typically (for them, that is) sad note Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning), head of Hudsucker Industries, decides to take his own life right in the middle of a board meeting and does so by running across the table and jumping out of the window. At this point, the company votes to replace him with a real doofus so that they can get away with an industrial scam. Therefore, while the idiotic Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) is left in charge of Hudsucker, the manipulative Sydney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman) is actually pulling the strings. It all goes well until a fast-talking reporter (Jennifer Lason Leigh) decides to uncover the truth about what's going on.Leigh's character is obviously modeled after the female protagonist of His Girl Friday, seemingly confirming the Coens' intention to revisit the screwball comedy genre. And even if the scenes where she deals with her narrow-minded male colleagues (John Mahoney and Bruce Campbell - always a welcome presence) are, without a doubt, hilarious, there is very little to laugh about in The Hudsucker Proxy, at least in terms of immediate reactions. On paper, this might look like a broad, traditional comedy; in reality, it's an ingenious satire on industrial society, owing more to Gilliam's Brazil than anything by Capra or Hawks. Sure, it's less creepy and surreal (to a degree) than Gilliam's masterpiece, but the intent and sharpness is a match.Furthermore, this film can be seen as a lighter companion piece to Barton Fink and its reflections on Hollywood. Of course, the Coens are too clever to openly show that, but the film's most successful joke is that before Norville, played by an endearingly dim-looking Robbins, comes up with the famous hoola hoop (You know, for kids!) there's no mention of what Hudsucker produces. It's industry for its own sake, much like those film studios who deliver empty products favoring business over art. And what is Newman's character if not a God-like film producer\/studio head, a cynical version of Harvey Weinstein, Jerry Bruckheimer or Joel Silver (who coincidentally produced the movie), handing the job to talentless people for profit's sake?Granted, most people didn't get that the first time around, but that's no reason for damning a film; on the contrary, such a strong metaphorical resonance ought to be revisited, again and again.

I also hate these people who judge this movie poorly because its all about Italians its pathetic I read so many comments here and everywhere that the sole basis of a poor rating is it being about Italians its a joke, Like in on the waterfront when Marlon Brando's character, transitions from a goon for organized crime to at the end of the film a changed man who wants to be a better man, Michael Corleone's character I feel is the greatest transformation in all of film history, he changes from this nice quiet military, war hero, good citizen, to a dark, ruthless, emotionless character, which he really has to do the collapse of his family. That alone i think makes this movie great, not to forget how great Marlon Brando is in this along with James Caan and Robert Duvall. This movie broke a lot of barriers in film, starting a lot of trends and setting standards for so many other mafia movies, like Goodfellas, and the Departed etc...

Of course Jack is warned off at the beginning for asking questions that no one want's answered. And Once Jack smells blood he goes after it with a shotgun and no fear.

Jack Carter isn't likable he's a killing machine sent on a personal mission despite what his mob bosses say Carter Crosses them one time too many and he is left on his own with no protection and no friends.

I was NOT disappointed! Sure, it is in possession of a Hollywood ending, and a romantic back-story to boot, but I found this both hilarious and touching.Following the plot of the original cartoon and picture book by Dr. Seuss, How The Grinch Stole Christmas is the tale of one Grinch, masterfully played by Carrey as the bitter but witty green man, and his loathing for Christmas and all it stands for. The film goes deeper into his past, explaining that he was constantly mocked for his bitter disposition and hairy face as a kid, but when he finally got into the Christmas spirit and crafted a homemade tree angel for his heart-throb, Martha May Whovier, everyone simply laughed at his gift's lack of sparkles and beauty.

It's the answer to Kendall's dreams. Joy reigns, for a few minutes anyway, until the trip starts. He gets sea sick on the cross-channel boat. They get drunk in Paris. Then, leurs malheurs, the ship out of Marseilles turns into a more serious business. He has an affair with a princess who turns out to be a fraud who milks him of his money. Kendal's wife and an honest, avuncular fellow fall for each other. The couple plan to part, but then Kendall discovers he's been had, and Barry realizes she can't leave Kendall because he's such an impractical wimp. They get together again, deserted by their lovers, in Singapore, almost penniless. Their humble, outbound ship is involved in a collision and they are left alone aboard her as she slowly gurgles into the sea. Rescued by a Chinese junk manned by an indifferent crew, they find they've inadvertently eaten the ship's black cat. They finally reach London and begin arguing again.I referred to it as a morality tale. I'm trying to think of how the moral might be most ergonomically expressed. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence? All that glitters is not gold? The end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started? There's no place like home? I think I know what Hitchcock was getting at in the title, Rich and Strange. It's a quote from a song in Shakespeare's The Tempest. In the play it tells us that a skeleton buried in the sea will undergo not corruption but an enrichment because of barnacles, sea anemones, and the attendant varicolored tropical fish. Hitchcock turns it upside down. The sea will not turn a dead thing (like a marriage) into something beautiful. It will just rot. I'm guessing at the irony, true, but I'm open to other less banal suggestions.Anyway, it's quite a trip, not a trifling thing like some of Hitchcock's other early works (eg., Champagne). A comic spinster with thick glasses is introduced on the long voyage aboard the liner. At the costume party, she is dressed either as Margaret Mead or Big Bo Peep. And there is some genuine tension when their last crummy ship is sinking around them. The suspense is enhanced because the couple seem so extravagantly stupid. Here they are on an empty sea, alone on a ship that could turn end up and go down like a lead line at any moment and what do they do? They're in their night clothes, so they'd better find something to put on -- in case somebody comes. Next step? Perhaps we should find a raft or something. But, no. They step over a dead crew member and find a brandy bottle instead. In some ways the most interesting episode is aboard the Chinese junk, the one on which they see a baby being born and roughly handled by the family, the one on which they eat the cat. None of the Chinese seem to celebrate the birth. They simply pour a bucket of cold sea water over the howling neonate. Barry's maternal instincts are aroused and she becomes indignant. Leave them alone, advises Kendall, The Chinese breed like devils anyway. (Not so much anymore, Hank.) The incident is interesting because Hitchcock was never big on babies OR family sentiment. There's a baby on the Lifeboat, of course, but it's already past sentimentality.Not to run out of space here. Joan Barry is a blond, pretty in a Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio kind of way, with her eyes set wide apart, but with a thin, porcelain figure that might shatter if handled indelicately. Her role is that of the serious partner, and she fits the role. Henry Kendall is supposed to be itchier, edgier, less stable, funny, and he looks just about right as well. His features are basically a comic. Hitchcock deploys some directorial techniques that may seem humdrum now but were unquestionably more novel when he used them. They're simple enough. A drunk's point of view with the camera out of focus. A menu from which the items spring out at a nauseous man. If it's not among Hitchcock's best, it's certainly not one of his flops.
