It moved the notion of narration way in front of the camera and even beyond, in front of a character's eye but behind his mind. Other experiments have tried this from the failed `Watcher,' to `Snake Eyes and `Body Double.' Nolan failed because his story had too many noir complications -- plus it is difficult to simultaneously twist both the story and the narration of the story.He solved that in `Memento.' A very successful project which amazed more with its competent handling of the problem than in the value of the experience of actually watching it. It promised much of a future from someone who understand what film was all about. But as with Soderbergh, that promise is dashed. I am sure that Nolan believes his new sponsor, Soderbergh, that you can alternate commercial projects with the more personal work (like his `Limey'). We'll have to see in both cases.But as to this project, it fails. The notion of the original was clever history can be changed by shifting evidence, and that shift can make the merely true truly true. (`Lone Star.') The backbone is the story of cop who planted evidence to catch the real crooks and is mirrored by a mystery writer who worked the other way. His quest involved making his murder fiction more powerful by inserting a real murder in it, then mirroring the reporting on the page with the reporting to a cop. The idea went further into Nolan\/Soderbergh territory by having the `narrator' experience sleep deprivation which produces hallucinations and memory transformation of the sort that influences perception and especially memory. This is the stuff that involves the viewer in confusion about what is true, or so it was intended.But no one seems to have told Pacino, as if he would have listened anyway. Any opportunity to introduce ambiguity is completely wasted by him. He hallucinates from Robin's eyes but makes no note of it. He has a recurring Lady Macbeth moment of the indelible blood, but we get no feel for the shifting of memory as a stain. At the end, no one in the theater got the intended ambiguity of whether he knowingly shot his partner or not. The intended point was that he didn't know now, but my whole audience believe it was settled as a revelation.Swank, who knows something about acting about acting, plays a mere Sandra Bullock role here. What a waste. Robin Williams gives --  surprisingly -- the best performance of the project, which should be a real warning. Little is made of the fact that he is a writer of detective stories. That the letters (do they exist?) from the murdered girl were good poetry, elicited by him in her mind just as he (in the original film) enters Pacino's mind.Is Pacino's character a live worth living?

Dick, sci-fi writer and the inspiration behind 'Minority Report', also inspired the 1990 'Total Recall'. 'Total Recall', for those who haven't seen it, is a brilliant watch - it involves you in a very immersive world, and leaves you almost as lost as the lead character, as to where the twists may turn next.  The thing about 'Total Recall', though, was that it wasn't for the faint hearted - even the censored version sees quite a bit of gore. Now, I'll admit to you now, I'm a bit of a squeamish fellow.  And when people choose to put unnecessary gore, make the movie into an unnecessary freak show, then it makes an otherwise brilliant tangle of ideas into something that alienates your simpler viewer. Having said that, I was very excited about 'Minority Report' coming out, but I approached it very anxiously, hoping it wouldn't turn into a freakshow. The truth of the matter is, 'Minority Report' is a much, much more accessible movie than the aforementioned gem - it still gives you the creeps at all the right moments, especially if you value your eyeballs - but it never violates your trust in Spielberg's better judgement. It takes place in one possible future - sometimes bright, sometimes bleak, but by all accounts, a frighteningly apt projection - where murder has all but been wiped out by the department of Pre-Crime.  This department, headed by a well cast Max Von Sydow, and employing the services of a VERY well cast Tom Cruise, (the only possible actor who could have made this role work) uses the predictions of three 'Pre Cogs' to stop murders before they happen. The system is only in experimental stages, but it is all but expected to be adopted by mainstream culture when the vote is put to masses.  All the same, a devilishly likeable Colin Farrell is brought into investigate the inner workings.  Coincidently or not, this just happens to coincide with our flawed hero Anderton (Cruise) finding himself in a dilly of a pickle - the latest case he attempts to piece together finds himself as the killer. If you think you know where this movie is headed, you're in for a rude awakening - somehow, I doubt even the Pre-Cogs themselves could see the ending to this one. Well, maybe the Pre-Cogs. 10 out of 10, 100 out of 100 - a movie to be encouraged.  It is rich in story, it doesn't lose itself in dodgy CGI special effects, and it opens up a lot of avenues of thought, particularly to the nastier elements of mankind.

Many say that American Pie 2 basically had no plot, but did the first?? The whole group is back in this funny sequel. The 5 boys go to a camp at a lake and rent a property there to party in, the ENTIRE cast of the original is back, this time the boys make a pact to make this the best summer they would have together...That's a plot..I guess..Sorta!Is it as good as the first? Maybe not. Yet the films are very similar, leaving Jim in his typical embaressing situations, you've got to love it.Of course there is the gross humour, this film isnt exactly titled for kids,just like the original. Yet that i was a little disappointed about was the fact that the cast was a little out of touch in this film.I mean this time the film is basically set upon the boys, the rest of the cast is here and there, but their screen time is nowhere near as much as the first.Some say the script sux. I beg to differ, remember this is a teen movie,it brain-feeds TEENS, it only works for TEENS.The script wasn't a masterpiece,yet it did match with a teens thoughts, i wasnt expecting anything more of the script. There are many funny moments, like Jim getting glued to himself,the embaresing Bandcamp situation, OZ & his Girlfriend having phone sex and being interrupted by Stifler, the lesbian situation, jims dad OF COURSE, the introduction and much more. I must add that Stifler is still really funny, i did not like his little brother one bit. I really reccomend the DVD, it has so many extra features, the OUT-TAKES are hilarious.ACTING It was good, Jim really knows how to react with his situations. The whole cast did a good job, not flawless but still they were totally intact with their characters, they did a good job remembering who they were in part one, Alyson Halligon was GREAT.ACTORS Everyone is back, so thats gotta be good. I loved all the actors in this movie.The selection was good, though the characters are beginning to show age, they dont really look 19 anymore, so they better hurry with that trilogy.SCRIPT The script was adequate not much more i can say. No-one can expect a top of the pop script, the screen-writer did a good job keeping the characters in line, and giving them slight changes so they weren't so boring. Even though the plot was thin, some things were really funny in the film, the screenwriter should be applauded for that.Yet the cast (besides the boys) needed more screen time.CINEMA Quiet good, the scenes- especially by the lake were great to look at,there was nothing really special with the camera work or technique, but theydid get the right effect, it was enjoying to watch, the film looked really colourful, sometimes the characters glowed with their fake tans.COMEDY Very good, i would say that it was on par with its original. They are very similar in the comedic kind of sense. Many scenes delivered alot of laughs, thats a good sign. If you are in a bad mood, and really needto brighten your day with some sillyness, you would love this! Or the original.MUSIC\/SOUND The Soundtrack to American Pie 2 was FANTASTIC. One of the best things about the movie. Part one had a great soundtrack, but this was BETTER,the music really sets the mood, The music is college\/grunge great choice in music.OVERALL American Pie 2 is definantley worth the buy, especially on DVD. I think that those that think this or the original sucked are a little too old for this. If you are a teen, or are young at heart, the laughs will come flowing to you, if you are old and grumpy, expect to finish the film with a BIGGER frown.

If you are in a bad mood, and really needto brighten your day with some sillyness, you would love this! Or the original.MUSIC\/SOUND The Soundtrack to American Pie 2 was FANTASTIC. One of the best things about the movie. Part one had a great soundtrack, but this was BETTER,the music really sets the mood, The music is college\/grunge great choice in music.OVERALL American Pie 2 is definantley worth the buy, especially on DVD. I think that those that think this or the original sucked are a little too old for this. If you are a teen, or are young at heart, the laughs will come flowing to you, if you are old and grumpy, expect to finish the film with a BIGGER frown. I loved this film, although the original maybe a touch better with plot,i still think they did a great job with this film,and i would LOVE the whole cast to come back one more time, I cant get enough of them.****\/ ***** (4 out of 5 stars)  ","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"25 June 2002","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  THE SCORE sets itself up in the previews, and indeed, in the first few scenes alone to be a cerebral chess game of a movie, pitting the seasoned veteran against the rookie with everything to prove. The finale proves this to be a movie that spent too much of its money hiring three hollywood Titans (As Norton is quickly becoming), and not enough on a screen writer. Brando does the best he can with the fluff that he's given, but we don't buy into his fear and determination. DeNiro shines as always, but seems to lack a softer side that would have the audience really pulling for him. Norton's best performance is as the janitor's assistant, and throws away the rest of his lines as slickly as a used car-salesman selling snake oil. This audience member doesn't trust him from the onset, and thusly, the end of the movie comes as no surprise. All in all, this movie promises a lot, and delivers exactly what has come to be expected of a move that spends more time post-production selling tickets than pre-production actually making a movie worth seeing.

My reaction to this so-called comedy is the true opposite of sex.The primary problem is in the writing. While there is a scattering of tee-hee funny lines, the script reads like a first draft in need of revision. There is hardly an event, character, or situation that Joe Moviegoer would find relatable. The actors find themselves struggling to convincingly deliver contrived, unnatural dialogue. The writer has the characters reacting to each increasingly absurd situation by doing whatever it takes to lead to the next scene, instead of remaining true to their character. To reiterate the compliant of another user, no one would ever put up with the things that these characters put up with.The secondary problem is the direction. As mentioned before, the actors had quite a challenge before them, given the script. Unfortunately, it seems that directer Roo only gave them one crack at each take. On top of that, there are moments when it seems that the editor has left the building (long, flat monologues). It's like the film-makers couldn't decide if this was a drama or a comedy.I can only think of two reasons why this movie got the reviews it did. First of all, it overflows with homosexuality. Take that however you want. But I think critics are afraid to do their job when watching movies that tackle minority issues. Despite your politics, a bad movie is a bad movie. Secondly, I think a lot of critics and movie-goers actually bought into the cheesy one-liners. Quips are great and all. But no amount of good lines can make up for a very bad film.
