[{"date":"27 February 2002","score":"","review":"  1st watched 2\/27\/2002 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Andrew Adamson & Vicky Jenson) Funny anti-Disney, anti-cute fairy tale, computer animated, ugly ogre wins all story.  This starts out from the beginning as a big slap in the face to the usual Disney princess gets rescued by the handsome prince charming with many references to that other animation studio throughout.  And Dreamworks truly has gone another direction by adding some adult humor, cursing, and even sex references to it's recent movies like this and the well-made but overlooked Antz.  It's still ok for kids, but also bearable for adults and that's where I think they have really got something different in the way of animation.  There is also a lot of great music whether it's a remake or a new tune(for the most part not sung by the characters but a background to the story.)  All in all this movie is a pretty fun way to spend an hour and a half with a pretty basic story but humorous and entertaining throughout.

It was the 1st Halloween movie I'd seen and I was so impressed that I've rented it several times since. *THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* The atmosphere starts out creepy right at the beginning, as an ambulance makes its way along a dark, twisting road to the Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium, where Michael Myers has been in a coma since being set on fire at the end of Halloween 2. While en route to another hospital, he overhears the ambulance crew referring to his niece and comes to life, savagely killing the crew who are trapped inside.During the night, that niece, Jamie Lloyd, who lives with another family, spots an ambulance outside her home, and then after going back to her room discovers Myers is hiding in it! When the lightning flashed, showing him standing in the mirror, I just about jumped out of my skin! An interesting bit was where he appeared in the doorway, immediately after Jamie saw him sitting up on the other side of her bed. Loomis's first encounter comes after he & his boss find out that the Illinois State Police have discovered the wrecked ambulance that was carrying Myers, and Loomis heads off to a gas station where Myers has acquired his traditional coveralls and wicked-looking knife. The part that spooked me the most came when Jamie was standing in front of the mirror, holding up the clown outfit. Suddenly the image in the mirror changes to that of a six-year-old boy who murdered his sister in 1963, and Myers himself appears behind her as he pulls down his mask. This mask is different from the first two, but I found it more frightening because the hollow, dark eyes give the impression that there is no human inside it. The ending scared me as well, because it left an unanswered question  -  was Myers 'reborn' or somehow connected to his niece another way? Donald Pleasance remains effective as the psychiatrist trying to stop the apparently demonic Michael, along with the new sheriff Meeker and Ellie Cornell (what a sweetheart!) as Jamie's half-sister Rachel. This one lacks the graphic gore of Halloween 2, and it seems that director Dwight Little has tried to stick to Carpenter's original formula. For the most part he and his crew have succeeded. It's better than most of the Friday the 13th ones in that you don't see most of the killings - only the end result. Definitely on a par with the first two and probably better.
