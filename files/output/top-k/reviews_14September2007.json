[{"date":"14 September 2007","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Charlie Chaplin brings back The Tramp in Modern Times, a 1936 film that also stars Paulette Goddard. The film is mostly silent - going against modern times in 1936 - though sound effects, music, radio announcements, that type of thing, can be heard throughout. The Tramp and the Gamin (Paulette Goddard) are always silent. Yet they convey anything anybody ever needed to know.Modern Times is about a little man who just doesn't seem to belong anywhere. In the beginning, he's working in a factory on an assembly line, and when an efficiency expert brings in a feeding machine that will require workers to take less time for lunch, our Tramp is chosen. The machine breaks down while still connected to Chaplin, making for a fabulous scene. In another scene, he becomes part of the machine as he goes through it.The Depression is on and jobs are hard to come by, especially when you keep getting into trouble, so the Tramp goes from job to job. Eventually he meets the homeless Gamin, who is quick on her feet, and the two attempt to survive the hard times together.A small but handsome man, Chaplin as the Tramp is still recognizable today with his funny walk and little mustache. The most astounding thing about Chaplin is the way he used his body. The most brilliant example of this is the roller skating scene, but there are so many others - Chaplin's flexibility and balletic grace made him the greatest comedian ever. When he fails as a waiter and is called upon to sing in a restaurant, his movements to the song are phenomenal.Goddard is young and beautiful as the Gamin and does a terrific job as a streetwise girl who can't help getting discouraged. But The Tramp won't let her - he knows that together, they can make it. As funny in parts as this movie is, we're reminded of how poverty victimizes people and how try as some might, some people just don't belong in these modern, practical times that don't allow time for some of the simpler pleasures.One scene that foreshadowed corporate America today - there is a large television screen where the boss can see everything that's going on, even in the bathrooms, where he yells at people to get back to work. I'm sure that, even if that isn't available in most, if any, companies, workers definitely feel they are being kept track of every minute, with the use of time sheets, security cards, sign-ins, computer monitoring and the like.A truly great film by a master. A must-see.
