That movie was really so bad, that I was convinced that all his movies would be like that. But when the DVD of this movie was reviewed in a popular magazine and they said that this was an excellent movie, I decided to give it a try anyway. Only a couple of days later it was shown on television. I taped it out of curiosity and now that I've seen it, I can tell you that this Pecker sure is a lot better than A Dirty Shame.In this movie we see how a young 'nobody' from Baltimore becomes an overnight sensation in the art world of New York. He's a sandwich shop employee who photographs his weird family or things that he sees on the street as a hobby. When he keeps his very first 'exhibition' in the shop where he works, his pictures are noticed by a gallery owner who loves the pictures full of misery and weirdness. His photographs are sold for enormous prices, but when he sees how his family, friends and strangers react to his success he decides that he will no longer go to New York, they will have to come to him if they want to see more of him. And they do, but what they get to see there, is a bigger shock than they could ever imagine...It's not difficult to see why I loved this movie a lot more than A Dirty Shame. The first reason is that this movie has an actual story. This movie really has something to say and isn't just intended to shock as many people as possible. The fact that they make fun of the art world who considers everything out of the ordinary as art because they don't know what the reality is like, isn't just funny, it's not that far from the truth either. I guess there are many people who feel about modern art that way. Nobody understands why they are making such a fuss about it, but apparently we are all supposed to like it. The second reason why I liked this movie is because this one had much better acting performances to offer. I'm not saying that everything that you will see is great, but at least the characters have some meaning thanks to the performances of the different actors like Edward Furlong, Christina Ricci,...Overall this isn't a great movie, but thanks to its criticism and some good jokes - which never really go too far - this is an enjoyable movie. It certainly isn't the best comedy ever, but I liked it a lot more than A Dirty Shame. I give this movie a 6.5\/10.

By the end, our thoughts have been altered a bit and its a film that leaves you thinking.Conrad, played brilliantly by Timothy Hutton in an Oscar winning role, is the depressed suicidal son of a couple struggling to cope with their son's drowning death. Conrad of course feels responsible, and has already tried to take his own life once before.Reluctantly, he begins to see a shrink at the advice of his father. Dr. Berger, also played brilliantly by Judd Hirsch though there are no slouches in the cast, helps Conrad through thick and thin. By the end of the movie, the audience truly feels for all characters to some degree.As has been stated, the acting is magnificent. The story may seem simple but this type of film really doesn't need a heavy plot. Its an excellent look at the problems we all face. When I first saw this at a young age I related completely to Conrad's character. When I saw this tonight, I related more to the adults and could really feel for them a lot more than I remembered. Each character has a unique sense of reality to them. The actors really carry the film, making the characters seem like real people we've known for years.Unfortunately this movie has received somewhat of a bad reputation over the years as the film that beat Raging Bull in 1980 for the Best Picture and Director Oscars. While both movies are excellent, its sad that one has to be better than the other and people just don't enjoy both movies for what they are. Many people have preconceived opinions about this 'small' film they have not heard of. After all, Raging Bull is an all time classic.

In that sense this is a great movie in the same ranks as the Jurassic Park. In the '50s when this was made, I'm sure it was more so than now. The romance of space travel to a remote planet, then seeing Dr. Mobius' very futuristic and oasis like home in middle of nowhere, having intelligent robot who can almost do miracles as a servant, the stunning scale and power of Krell's inventions, then the attack of invisible hostile enemy that only shows itself in the midst of electric fence and particle beam weapon, the way the invisible enemy approaches the house with its only indication being trees being torn down as it draws closer and closer. All of these visual scenery is what we sort of have in our mind but can only see in a movie like the Forbidden Planet ( and more recently in the likes of Jurassic Park ). The only difference are that Forbidden Planet deals with what we imagine our future to be and Jurassic Park with our desire to see prehistory come to life. In this sense this movie stirs and moves its audience by a transporting experience only a well made movie can give. I can't describe any better about what makes this movie so good, but there's lot going on about this movie that makes it not just a simple sci-fi movie. Many people who watch this movie attest to its many layered-ness from its plot to visual effects ( some which looks very much like a precursor to Star Trek series of the '60s ), choice of main characters ( A captain, doctor, and a first officer - Hmmm, didn't I see that somewhere else ? ), a robot that became seminal influence for the robot in Lost in Space etc. etc.. Because of the so many built in values in this movie, this movie ages gracefully and remains entertaining even after half a century (!). A true classic in its own right.

This film was released later in the same year that their first venture - House on Haunted Hill - was unleashed upon audiences across the world, and the film sees the two men deliver more of what they did with their first feature. House on Haunted Hill was much loved then - and now - for it's ludicrous plot line and hammy performances, and The Tingler marks another successful fusion of these elements. The plot line is even sillier this time round, and it follows Vincent Price's scientist as he conducts his experiments into fear. He discovers that when we get frightened, a thing, which he called 'the tingler', manifests itself on the spinal column and the only way to rid oneself of this 'tingler' is to scream. Deaf mute's cant scream, however, and soon after discovering that his friend's wife suffers from that condition, and has an acute fear of blood, Price gets to work on attempting to isolate and remove the tingler.William Castle shows his flair and passion for entertaining his audience throughout this film, with the whole film being, basically, a metaphor for the horror genre on the whole. Castle uses several different methods of getting his audience to scream, and while this film isn't very scary by today's standards - watching this master of entertainment weave his magic is always delightful. Another thing that's delightful about this film is the fact that Vincent Price is in it. Price has an amazing ability to command to the screen, and while this movie doesn't feature his best performance - he's always entertaining, and it's always a pleasure to see him on screen. Castle's special effects are hokey, with the central monster - the tingler - looking rather silly, but that adds to the fun effect of the movie and if the effects had been terrific examples of how good special effects can be - the film wouldn't have been nearly as fun as it is. The Tingler is silly throughout, and it gets really ridiculous towards the end, but if you watch knowing that this isn't to be taken seriously, you'll enjoy yourself just like Castle intended.

I know I am not breaking any new ground when I say that this film is a classic, but hopefully I can educate some of the younger viewers and posters as to how realistic this film is, in some ways.First of all, I believe that anyone who has ever played organized youth sports has had a Tanner Boyle, Timmy Lupus and a Kelly Leek on their teams. This is just how it is, and for better or worse, it is one of the galvanizing factors that make youth leagues etch themselves indelibly into the memories of all those who have participated in them.Second of all, kids curse. I don't know who the nay-sayers out there are, but they should look back into their own memories and try to figure out just when they learned to use the F-word. If you didn't learn it from your parents, you learned it from other kids. Granted, not all of us knew exactly what the words meant at that age, but we still used them. It was a small measure of rebellion at the age of seven.When Tanner Boyle makes the comment that the team is filled with niggers, spics, Jews and now a broad, it would be a crass, hateful comment if it had come from an adult. Yet, as a youth, Tanner gets a laugh because we all know that he doesn't really mean it, he is just repeating what he has heard at home -- not to condone what might have been said over the Boyle dinner table. The proof of this is obvious when Tanner takes on the seventh grade, and makes a valiant attempt to preserve Timmy Lupus' honor before he gets thrown into a garbage can. Regardless of Tanner's racist remarks about the team, and his shunning of Lupus, Lupus, why don't you sit over there? (abbr.) he is willing to fight for those same people.Third, (sorry for the digression), that's what parents are like. It is a truth that goes down through the ages when it comes to their children, all adults are a-holes. When it comes time to see their children strive to excel at something, they become the obnoxious, bullying, chest-beating sh**s they have warned their children not to be. For the most part it is an extension to the children for what the parents' couldn't be in the first place, e.g. a good shortstop.And Fourth Losing. There is something about those pinstripes and even the moniker Yankees that make some of us want to do violent things to a couch. Mind you, I am not a native southerner, nor am I a Red Sox fan. I am just a man who can see the fact that pinstripes and the word Yankees symbolizes a corporate juggernaut that tries to annihilate the concept of fair play. For the Bears to ultilmately lose to the Yankees is just. They got beat. Perhaps it is an irony that this movie came out one year after the last choppers left Saigon, that defeat was in the air, so to speak. There was still a message to this movie. A message that I have carried throughout my adult life. A message that Churchill had during the Blitz, and Giuliani had in the post 9\/11 rubble.

It is a truth that goes down through the ages when it comes to their children, all adults are a-holes. When it comes time to see their children strive to excel at something, they become the obnoxious, bullying, chest-beating sh**s they have warned their children not to be. For the most part it is an extension to the children for what the parents' couldn't be in the first place, e.g. a good shortstop.And Fourth Losing. There is something about those pinstripes and even the moniker Yankees that make some of us want to do violent things to a couch. Mind you, I am not a native southerner, nor am I a Red Sox fan. I am just a man who can see the fact that pinstripes and the word Yankees symbolizes a corporate juggernaut that tries to annihilate the concept of fair play. For the Bears to ultilmately lose to the Yankees is just. They got beat. Perhaps it is an irony that this movie came out one year after the last choppers left Saigon, that defeat was in the air, so to speak. There was still a message to this movie. A message that I have carried throughout my adult life. A message that Churchill had during the Blitz, and Giuliani had in the post 9\/11 rubble. Once again, a line from Tanner Boyle Hey Yankees, you can take your trophy and shove it up your ass. Just wait until next year!

After years of feckless unemployed upper-middle-class living, Will views himself as an island, and sees his lack of long-term relationships as a plus.

I really am this shallow.But of course Will does have depths, and as played by Hugh Grant in a role that gives this smooth comedic actor a chance to showcase some previously-unguessed-at depths of his own, we find ourselves rooting for Will to find them as he finds himself attached unwillingly to a 12-year-old named Marcus, played with welcome non-cuteness by Nicholas Hoult. Marcus, an abuse magnet at school, is alternately worried for his unstable mother and searching for a pal. Will, a 12-year-old at heart, is a perfect if unknowing candidate.Based on the great Nick Hornby novel, About A Boy walks a fine line, doling out easy laughs and real pathos with deceptive ease. Like Hornby's book, the movie depicts Will's perverse detachment from the world as both delightful and pathetic. Life is a full plate of pain for those who participate, but the benefits, as Marcus tries to tell Will, beat all else.Of course, most of us don't have the luxury for island living, and the potential of resenting Will, especially as played by that handsome devil Grant, might have been the film's biggest danger. But Grant defuses things with a subtle characterization that downshifts on the smugness and draws on the lost boy within.For example, when Will tries to infiltrate a single-mothers' club as a way of bagging some commitment-free sex, we watch him tell the mothers about his own non-existent two-year-old boy Ned telling him you hang in there, Dad, then reacting with uncertain fear when the mothers enthuse about how remarkable that is for such a young child.But we also see the pain Will pretends isn't there, in brief flashes as he reflects on the hard-drinking failure his father became after his one-hit wonder, and especially in one great scene where Will finds himself with a woman he really cares about, unable to break out of his artifice at a critical moment. During that scene, and a later, angry one with Marcus, Grant's acting really demands consideration from those who dismiss him as a dandy glamor boy.The directors, Chris and Paul Weitz of American Pie-fame, prove they can make a film that delivers intelligence as well as laughter, and with writer Peter Hedges, fashion a script that takes some clever and daring liberties with Hornby's solid story. I especially liked the one near the end of the movie, but if I revealed anything I'd probably get some Flack for it, so say no more.The very last scene of the movie is a mistake, though, the kind of tidy resolution Hornby's novel and life itself rightly rejects. It's the one bum note in this film, but enough of one to dock it a point with me. Otherwise, I'd have to rate this above even the other cinematic Hornby adaptation, the classic High Fidelity. But this is a very entertaining film, with great set design, a terrific Rubber Soul-style Britpop title song by Badly Drawn Boy, tight editing, and subtle, crafty camera work. Also some great supporting performances, especially Toni Collette as Marcus' mother, who has the film's toughest role (she must be funny and suicidal) and manages to not only pull it off but gives About A Boy a wonderfully unstable center.

Whether the characters in the movie remind them of themselves, their parents, or their children, there is someone in that movie one can always recognize. There's a tremendous warmth in every scene, radiating a sense of love, confusion, and of old wounds that are (almost) too deep to heal. I always find it hard to believe that neither Fonda had ever met Hepburn, as it seems that they've known each other their whole lives.At the beginning, Norman and Ethel Thayer (Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn) arrive at their cabin in Maine for their fiftieth, and possibly last, summer together. Norman is nearly eighty and beginning to become senile. Ethel, about eleven years his junior, can only watch as her husband slowly fades.It soon becomes clear that Norman is obsessed with death and dying. Sent out to pick strawberries in the woods, he loses his way and comes running back to Ethel, who tries to console him with the now-famous line You're my knight in shining armour, and you're going to get right back on that horse and I'll be right behind you, and away we're going to go, go, go. That scene shows exactly what the relationship between Norman and Ethel is supposed to be like They love each other deeply, though they're not without faults, and stick together throughout good and bad. It sounds cliché, but it's rare to find this so well-written in a Hollywood film.Their daughter Chelsea (Jane Fonda) joins them to celebrate Norman's birthday, bringing her new boyfriend Bill (Dabney Coleman) and his son Billy (Doug McKeon). Chelsea has always had a difficult relationship with Norman (I didn't think we were mad...I thought we just didn't like each other), due to his sorrow over never having a son and her inability to communicate.Ernest Thompson's screenplay fully deserved the Oscar that year. The family he writes about are realistic, just as flawed as any real people. He plays with running gags effectively- for example, a joke involving the screen door, or various phrases such as San-frantastic! and suck face that Norman and Billy pick up from each other.Director Mark Rydell proves to be an excellent storyteller, and good at drawing powerful performances from his actors. The cinematography by Billy Williams and score by Dave Grusin are absolutely gorgeous.All the actors have nice chemistry together that is just right for the film, making you laugh one minute and cry the next. Particularly good are Hepburn and Henry Fonda. The Fondas had a rocky relationship in reality, and in their only film together they reconciled offscreen as well- Henry Fonda died about a year later. On Golden Pond was his last film role, and Jane Fonda would always say that she was grateful she could make that movie with her father.Henry Fonda's performance is absolutely brilliant- funny, touching, and dead-on. As an old man afraid and accepting of death at the same time, he pulls it off beautifully. Notable scene Norman loses his way only a few minutes away from home, then returns only to bully the hapless mailman, Charlie (played very well by William Lanteau) in frustration.My favourite (of course) is Katharine Hepburn's portrayal of the strong, loving Ethel Thayer. At seventy-four, Hepburn shows that she is still her spunky self, putting her fascinating personality into the performance as usual. She portrayed a similar character in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, wonderfully I hasten to add, but Ethel Thayer seems to have much more charm and heart. This was Hepburn's last great role (forget that awful Love Affair), and she seems to know it. She really makes this one count. Notable scene Norman suffers angina at the very end of the summer. Ethel tries frantically to call the hospital, but to no avail. She asks him if he's going to die on her. He tells her that it doesn't hurt anymore, and she tearfully recounts her feelings as she realized that Norman would actually die someday.Jane Fonda's portrayal is my least favourite. Perhaps it's because Chelsea isn't a very sympathetic character, or maybe it's perhaps I just plain dislike Jane Fonda (though I admire her politics). Even though she plays the role well, it feels like she could do more. Notable scene Chelsea admits to Ethel that she's in control of her life everywhere except for at the lake, and that she has resented answering to Norman her whole life.Doug McKeon proves to be a very talented young actor. Though the character of Billy doesn't seem very real to a cynical teenager of today, I found that he played it very nicely. Notable scene Billy asks Norman Are you afraid to die? Minutes later, he accidentally drives their boat into a rock and ends up saving Norman's life.Dabney Coleman's character Bill is a pompous jerk, but Dabney Coleman is very good at portraying a pompous jerk. I'll say no more there. Notable scene Bill asks Norman if he and Chelsea can sleep in the same bed. Norman gives him an earful, and Bill returns the favour.Many people have said this movie is a depressing story about death. I found it was the opposite a life-affirming tale of aging, marriage, family, friendship, commitment, and yes, death as well. However, I feel the main theme is love in all its forms.

Whether the characters in the movie remind them of themselves, their parents, or their children, there is someone in that movie one can always recognize. There's a tremendous warmth in every scene, radiating a sense of love, confusion, and of old wounds that are (almost) too deep to heal. I always find it hard to believe that neither Fonda had ever met Hepburn, as it seems that they've known each other their whole lives.At the beginning, Norman and Ethel Thayer (Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn) arrive at their cabin in Maine for their fiftieth, and possibly last, summer together. Norman is nearly eighty and beginning to become senile. Ethel, about eleven years his junior, can only watch as her husband slowly fades.It soon becomes clear that Norman is obsessed with death and dying. Sent out to pick strawberries in the woods, he loses his way and comes running back to Ethel, who tries to console him with the now-famous line You're my knight in shining armour, and you're going to get right back on that horse and I'll be right behind you, and away we're going to go, go, go. That scene shows exactly what the relationship between Norman and Ethel is supposed to be like They love each other deeply, though they're not without faults, and stick together throughout good and bad. It sounds cliché, but it's rare to find this so well-written in a Hollywood film.Their daughter Chelsea (Jane Fonda) joins them to celebrate Norman's birthday, bringing her new boyfriend Bill (Dabney Coleman) and his son Billy (Doug McKeon). Chelsea has always had a difficult relationship with Norman (I didn't think we were mad...I thought we just didn't like each other), due to his sorrow over never having a son and her inability to communicate.Ernest Thompson's screenplay fully deserved the Oscar that year. The family he writes about are realistic, just as flawed as any real people. He plays with running gags effectively- for example, a joke involving the screen door, or various phrases such as San-frantastic! and suck face that Norman and Billy pick up from each other.Director Mark Rydell proves to be an excellent storyteller, and good at drawing powerful performances from his actors. The cinematography by Billy Williams and score by Dave Grusin are absolutely gorgeous.All the actors have nice chemistry together that is just right for the film, making you laugh one minute and cry the next. Particularly good are Hepburn and Henry Fonda. The Fondas had a rocky relationship in reality, and in their only film together they reconciled offscreen as well- Henry Fonda died about a year later. On Golden Pond was his last film role, and Jane Fonda would always say that she was grateful she could make that movie with her father.Henry Fonda's performance is absolutely brilliant- funny, touching, and dead-on. As an old man afraid and accepting of death at the same time, he pulls it off beautifully. Notable scene Norman loses his way only a few minutes away from home, then returns only to bully the hapless mailman, Charlie (played very well by William Lanteau) in frustration.My favourite (of course) is Katharine Hepburn's portrayal of the strong, loving Ethel Thayer. At seventy-four, Hepburn shows that she is still her spunky self, putting her fascinating personality into the performance as usual. She portrayed a similar character in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, wonderfully I hasten to add, but Ethel Thayer seems to have much more charm and heart. This was Hepburn's last great role (forget that awful Love Affair), and she seems to know it. She really makes this one count. Notable scene Norman suffers angina at the very end of the summer. Ethel tries frantically to call the hospital, but to no avail. She asks him if he's going to die on her. He tells her that it doesn't hurt anymore, and she tearfully recounts her feelings as she realized that Norman would actually die someday.Jane Fonda's portrayal is my least favourite. Perhaps it's because Chelsea isn't a very sympathetic character, or maybe it's perhaps I just plain dislike Jane Fonda (though I admire her politics). Even though she plays the role well, it feels like she could do more. Notable scene Chelsea admits to Ethel that she's in control of her life everywhere except for at the lake, and that she has resented answering to Norman her whole life.Doug McKeon proves to be a very talented young actor. Though the character of Billy doesn't seem very real to a cynical teenager of today, I found that he played it very nicely. Notable scene Billy asks Norman Are you afraid to die? Minutes later, he accidentally drives their boat into a rock and ends up saving Norman's life.Dabney Coleman's character Bill is a pompous jerk, but Dabney Coleman is very good at portraying a pompous jerk. I'll say no more there. Notable scene Bill asks Norman if he and Chelsea can sleep in the same bed. Norman gives him an earful, and Bill returns the favour.Many people have said this movie is a depressing story about death. I found it was the opposite a life-affirming tale of aging, marriage, family, friendship, commitment, and yes, death as well. However, I feel the main theme is love in all its forms. Ethel, Norman and Chelsea all love each other (though some of the relationships are hidden deeper), and they soon expand their circle to include Bill and Billy.

If one proceeds further with that description - no war, no crime, no poverty, etc. which have indeed been eradicated in the time-frame of this film, then we should be looking at utopia, a paradise world. But... there is that 'but' - which sends a little chill down one's spine. The plot hinges on a sudden demand by the corporate powers who rule the world that the star player of THE GAME and captain of the Houston team, Jonathan E (Caan), retire. Despite Jonathan's status (he is treated like a rock god - picture all of professional sports today rolled into one with him as the undisputed superstar), it's very evident that certain corporate execs hold complete power. It's telling that when Jonathan enters the odd office retreat of the most prominent exec (Houseman), he cuts himself; then the toughest athlete in the world needs a handkerchief from the executive - he needs his help. The execs manage business and manipulate to ensure the status quo. When the exec enters the players' locker room, he extols the virtues of THE GAME, how great it is; when alone later with Jonathan, he calls it a stupid game, an awful game. His goals, of course, are different for each situation - this is how execs manage the world to their own ends.The best science fiction extrapolates from a proposed thesis, creating worlds based on certain past events, i.e. if events progress in a certain way, then the resulting world will be 'like this.' If certain changes occur at certain times, there will be certain repercussions, perhaps unexpected. Rollerball presents a world where, as mentioned, there is no poverty and, therefore, all citizens are well off in the material sense. But it stops there, doesn't it? With no wants, no needs, no new worlds to conquer, what does a society do? The result is, Rollerball explains, it stagnates; it degenerates; it stoops to the easy thrill (like burning down a stand of trees with a lethal toy gun) - it turns to an extreme to avoid pervasive boredom. When I first saw this film about 25 years ago, I didn't like Caan's performance; he basically mumbled his way through and appeared too lethargic, too dense to be the hero. But that was the point - almost everyone in this world is half-asleep, whether thru strange narcotics or self-delusion, and doesn't get it. They're all wrapped up in self-satisfaction and perennial smugness. The only ones who get it are certain execs - but now Jonathan is beginning to get it. Of course, the execs aren't too thrilled with that prospect. Free will on this world is an illusion - that's a secret to be kept tightly wrapped. (In one scene, it's stated that no one is sure who the 'Directors,' the Executive Board, are anymore; it's as if no one in the U.S.knew who the President or V.P. were - is it Bush? Kerry? Who cares? As long as I get my sports night, right?). With free will absent, that describes a population of sheep - more like drones, not individuals.The extreme, the outlet for most of the populace, is a very violent sport. I confess, even after seeing the film many times, I'm not too clear on all the rules, though it's the least important question of the film. To score, players need to toss a metallic ball into a hole before crossing a line (non too subtle, a red line). A reflection of the entire society, THE GAME is played out on a circular track; thus the players really go nowhere very fast. Rules seem arbitrary and change quite a bit; Jonathan's buddy, Moonpie, just contents himself with surprise attacks on opponents with no regard for real tactics - he's like a rowdy kid, clueless like everyone else. It's all just an outlet for aggression (Moonpie derides the Tokyo team and ends up, ironically, the way Jonathan warned him he would in a joking comment, the one genuine tragic moment). When this film first came out, it faced indifference and derision. Not many bought into the concept of extreme sports shaping a society and danger posed by Jonathan's individualism. I believe Rollerball was at least 30 years ahead of its time, probably more. It's taken this long to gain the appreciation it now has.

I was alone, stoned, and ready for a decent foreign film. Black and white, one great freaking soundtrack, amazing amateur acting, a very real script, and just a blazing atmosphere set this movie apart from almost every indie film in the last 20 years. a mixture of race had to be done to achieve the mentality of youth in a ghetto culture like this. I grew up in Echo Park, Compton, and in a sprawling, nasty, dirty, section of Indianapolis when I was much younger. I know how these kids felt.

How many of us have not been hated by someone who sees the world differently? How many of us have not instantly fallen in love?

It is emotions common to everyone that give the production its extreme appeal. I was cheering the girls, and would have been very hurt if they had not gotten back together again.I might add that this is the only DVD I have seen in which I enjoyed the director's comments as much as the production itself.Both of the young actresses displayed an amazing variety of facial expressions. The shot focusing on Cox's deep blue eyes while Karyn is unable to confront her mother with the truth is priceless, as is Cox's gesture half hiding her face and half saying so what as she flees the applauding crowd after the bathroom scene.The film's only weakness, in my opinion, is that everybody found someone in the end, at least at the very same instant. Life is simply not that generous.In summary, few viewers will be leave this experience feeling worse than when they began.

The story is told that Rambo walks around to the middle of the mountains to meet up with an old war buddy who he finds out died of cancer. When he is picked up by a small town sheriff, the sheriff mocks him and tells him not to come to his town again because it's his job to keep drifters like him out of it. Rambo is dropped off but he goes back to the town. The sheriff arrests him and takes him to jail. After being assaulted by officers and having horrible war flashbacks, Rambo goes nuts and destroys anything in his way. He escapes the station and goes into the hills for a war of his own. Now Rambo is a action icon! He is rough and tough, all violence. Richard Creena is just as great as Colonel Trautman, the man who trained Rambo. Brian Dennehy is superb as Sheriff Will, the mean law man who mocks Ramob. The story is both depressing and powerful as you see Rambo fight for his life for something he didn't do. The acting is not perfect but it succeeds in tension. The explosions are excellent from Rambo destroying the whole towns power grid to Rambo crashing cars. If you love hardcore action, you need to pick up a copy of Rambo. Rambo gets the big 7, depressing and sometimes slow but it works up a sweat to perform an excellent film. Recommended, enjoy.
