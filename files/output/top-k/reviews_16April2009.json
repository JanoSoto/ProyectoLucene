Murray Abraham, Anna Paquin, Busta Rhymes and newcomer Rob Brown. After helming the ambitious but abysmal remake of Alfred Hitchcock's classic horror chiller Psycho, Van Sant apparently wanted to remake his own classics rather than those of others. Sadly, lightning doesn't strike twice, and Finding Forrester pales in comparison with Good Will Hunting. Whether Van Sant intended to plagiarize himself or not, the two films remain bear an unmistakable similarity. Connery plays the equivalent of Robin Williams morose therapist, while Brown performs wonders in his film debut as a disadvantaged but brilliant ghetto teen modeled on Matt Damon's attitude-driven, blue-collar genius.Although it is an above-average, slightly claustrophobic drama about two guys who bring out the best in each other, Finding Forrester suffers from slow paced, melodramatic plotting. Cast as a 16-year old South Bronx high school pupil Jamal Wallace, Rob Brown brings quiet but believable dignity to the role or an unassuming, middle-class black whose superlative skill at sinking hoops complements his high academic test scores. Although he scores well on the SAT achievement test, Wallace deliberately sabotages his own grades at school so that his friends won't ostracize him as an egghead.Since Jamal and his pals frequent a local blacktop basketball court for pick-up games, they have noticed a mysterious old white man watching them with binoculars from his third-story apartment. William Forrester (Sean Connery of The Untouchables) never comes outside except at night to clean his window. Appropriately, they nickname him the 'Window.' When his friends dare him to break into Forrester's apartment, Jamal sneaks in late one night. Forrester surprises him and the frightened lad flees in such a rush that he abandons his backpack with his personal journals. Several days pass and Jamal spots his knapsack hanging in Forrester's window like a trophy. Eventually, Forrester pitches Jamal's incriminating backpack into the street at the youth's feet. Later that evening, Jamal inventories the contents and reads the helpful writing tips that Forrester has scribbled in his notebooks.His curiosity whetted by Forrester's comments, Jamal knocks on his door and the crotchety oldster demands a five thousand word apology before he will help him. So begins the mutually beneficial but improbable friendship between a man at the dusk of his life and another at the dawn his creativity. At the same time, Jamal's superb basketball skills come to the attention of Mailor-Callow, an exclusive Manhattan prep school looking for another star basketball player. Waiving tuition, the school awards Jamal a full athletic scholarship so he can start attending classes. When he isn't in class or dribbling on the basketball court, Jamal visits Forrester and the irascible curmudgeon teaches him how to enrich his writing.Write the first draft with your heart. Rewrite with your head. The key to writing is to write, not think, Forrester advises Jamal, but Forrester sets some important conditions. Anything Jamal writes cannot leave the premises, and Forrester allows no questions about me, my family, or why there was only one book. Gradually, as the glacial frigidity between them melts and their love for the written word cements their friendship, Jamal learns that Forrester is a renowned Salingeresque author.Director Gus Van Sant, of Drugstore Cowboy and To Die For, and freshman scenarist Mike Rich should be commended for shunning negative racial images. The problem with Rich's deeply moving screenplay is that neither Van Sant nor he is content with strictly exploring the surrogate father and son relationship between William and Jamal.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"16 April 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" None of the TV channels seem to rerun episodes of the superior 1960s series, The Untouchables, with Robert Stack as Elliot Ness. If they did, no explanation of who the untouchables were would be necessary.They were a small group of hand-picked agents from the Department of the Treasury, supposedly untouchable because they were shrimp pink and incorruptible. Their primary job was to battle Al Capone and, shortly after his being sent up the river, Frank Nitti in Chicago. The whole city was more than ordinarily corrupt during and after prohibition. After all, bootleg booze brought in a lot of money and, as Lord Acton should have said, money corrupts and absolute money corrupts absolutely.Here we have Kevin Costner as the idealistic but naive Elliot Ness who recruits his honest first lieutenant, Sean Connery, whom he finds walking a beat on the Chicago streets. Connery is a crusty old battle horse. His advice to Kostner goes something like this If your enemy brings fists to a fight, you bring a knife. If he brings a knife, you bring a gun. If he brings a gun, you send him to the morgue. Curiously enough, this particular line has been taken up and used in current arguments about conflicts with nations like Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Seriously. Connery helps Kostner get his act together. They hire an as-yet-untouched recruit from the police academy, Andy Garcia, and the team is sent an appointment from the Treasury Department, Charles Martin Smith, a pipe-smoking begoggled accountant seconded from Book Keeping who finds himself turned into a hero.Al Capone is played in an operatic style by Robert DeNiro, who enacts a tactic for imposing his will that is borrowed from Nicholas Ray's Party Girl. DeNiro is fine. He is apoplectic when Ness confronts him in a hotel lobby and challenges him to a fist fight. The team is triumphant but the happy ending is tempered by the terrible losses. The plot and dialog are effective in capturing a particular, brutal sort of masculine world. The only family we see is Ness's and it's used to pump up the threat quotient. Hardly any friends exist outside the cohesive group itself. There's a recurring refrain -- It's good to be married, right? -- and we must accept that it is because Ness's family dynamics are flawless. None of the other three members of the team seem to have families.With one notable exception, Casualties of War, Brian De Palma's movies irritate me to a greater or lesser extent. Too much Hitchcock. At some point, homage must turn into shameless rip off. Of course the suspenseful techniques work, otherwise Hitchcock wouldn't have become Hitchcock.Yet, it's still distracting when we see a point-of-view shot of an assassin approaching Sean Connery's apartment. The camera peeks through the windows as it follows Connery along the hallway, but when the camera steps on a board and it makes a creaking sound, causing Connery to glance at the window, the camera quickly slides to the side and hides against the brick wall. In a long take, the camera (that is, let me repeat, the killer and the viewer) open a window, glide through, and examine each room in the apartment until it and we and he discover Connery and he turns and aims a shotgun at he, we, and it. Holy Saint Jude -- enough is enough! That long and unprovoked point-of-view sequence would have been disdained by Hitchcock. The sources here are unquestionably the horror and slasher movies of the period, such as Friday the Thirteenth. There is another long, largely slow-motion sequence at Union Station involving a baby carriage bouncing down the stairs. The director's sources are getting classier. This one is no less than Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potyemkin.I'm having a little fun at the movie's expense but, as these things go, it's effectively done. A nicely put-together action thriller about a real historical group of tough cops who got the job done. If it's not entirely historically correct, so what? All stories of good and evil are partly fantasies. Relax and enjoy it.

He discovers that the mastermind is a Greek smuggler of heroine and weapons, Ari Kristatos(Julian Glover), a successful businessman, revered by the British and other countries, successfully able to hide his underhanded, corrupt extra curricular activities. Bond also partners up with Ari's nemesis, Columbo(Topol), another smuggler(..of more harmless goods such as cigarettes and pistachios!),whose lucrative criminal business he seeks to move in on, and Malina(the positively gorgeous Carole Bouquet), a vengeance seeking Greek beauty wanting to kill those responsible for her parents' death, an ace with a crossbow. Ari paid a hit-man to assassinate Melina's parents for they knew too much about where the sunken British ship(containing the device sought after)was..and were working with Bond's country to find the ship.A departure from the Roger Moore Bond films that came before it, featuring less gadgets and more stunt-oriented action set-pieces allowing 007 to out-ski, evade, out-drive, and out-shoot his adversaries, often receiving help from his allies, like Melina and Columbo with his men. There's a thrilling action set-piece where Bond must evade an expert Olympian East German skier with a marksman rifle shot, and two motorcycle assassins down an Italian slope, encountering innocent civilians and other athletes competing in various competitions. The chase in a Madrid village and countryside with Bond using Melina's embarrassingly small Citroën trying to outsmart two superior vehicles as the enemy follows behind constantly shooting, is also ridiculous, but entertaining. But, Bond's ascension up a mountain to infiltrate Ari's men stationed in a monastery to hand over the retrieved device to the in-coming Russians(..approaching in their helicopter)is a nail-biting and breathtaking affair where he must contend with a mercenary attempting to send him spiraling to his death. Moore does have some classic one-liners which accompany the action or contending with Ari's horny expert skater, Bibi(Lynn-Holly Johnson)who wishes to bed him. Julian Glover is a formidable foe as Ari, because he successfully shows how he could manipulate people into thinking he's a nice guy, quite a chilling villain who could give you a warm handshake while unflinchingly stabbing you in the back. Michael Gothard is a classic James Bond henchman archetype, Locque, who works as Ari's street leader, pointing out the troops on who to execute. Features a really neat two person submarine used by Bone and Melina to go underwater to find the British ship and important device, and the disposal of the oft-used gadget car proved that director John Glen was focused on returning the franchise to it's roots. There are homages to the classic Bond films of old, touching on his wife, visiting her grave, his disposing of Blofeld(John Hollis, a Telly Savalas look-a-like, treated as a caricature)in a helicopter that was wired from a remote control device with the plan going awry, and the toss of the top hat as it instantly finds it's place on the rack of M's office. While Bond finds some time to bed a few ladies, he seems far less sidetracked and more determined to complete the mission\/agenda. This is clearly a film directed in tone retracing the Bond character back to the golden years of Sean Connery, while still maintaining it's tongue-in-cheek humor, there's more emphasis on the action, less on goofy comedy bits and preponderance for silly special effects. Topol is a welcome presence as a likable criminal, who lends great support to Bond when he so desperately needs it, and FOR YOUR EYES ONLY rescued Moore from his character becoming an absolute clown. While I welcome gadgets, I was pleased with the decision to take this particular Bond film in an opposite direction, where the effects are not heavily relied upon to increase wonder and excitement. And, the villains in this film are less cartoonish and more realistic, with our Bond babe able to participate a bit more in assisting our hero.

Ari paid a hit-man to assassinate Melina's parents for they knew too much about where the sunken British ship(containing the device sought after)was..and were working with Bond's country to find the ship.A departure from the Roger Moore Bond films that came before it, featuring less gadgets and more stunt-oriented action set-pieces allowing 007 to out-ski, evade, out-drive, and out-shoot his adversaries, often receiving help from his allies, like Melina and Columbo with his men. There's a thrilling action set-piece where Bond must evade an expert Olympian East German skier with a marksman rifle shot, and two motorcycle assassins down an Italian slope, encountering innocent civilians and other athletes competing in various competitions. The chase in a Madrid village and countryside with Bond using Melina's embarrassingly small Citroën trying to outsmart two superior vehicles as the enemy follows behind constantly shooting, is also ridiculous, but entertaining. But, Bond's ascension up a mountain to infiltrate Ari's men stationed in a monastery to hand over the retrieved device to the in-coming Russians(..approaching in their helicopter)is a nail-biting and breathtaking affair where he must contend with a mercenary attempting to send him spiraling to his death. Moore does have some classic one-liners which accompany the action or contending with Ari's horny expert skater, Bibi(Lynn-Holly Johnson)who wishes to bed him. Julian Glover is a formidable foe as Ari, because he successfully shows how he could manipulate people into thinking he's a nice guy, quite a chilling villain who could give you a warm handshake while unflinchingly stabbing you in the back. Michael Gothard is a classic James Bond henchman archetype, Locque, who works as Ari's street leader, pointing out the troops on who to execute. Features a really neat two person submarine used by Bone and Melina to go underwater to find the British ship and important device, and the disposal of the oft-used gadget car proved that director John Glen was focused on returning the franchise to it's roots. There are homages to the classic Bond films of old, touching on his wife, visiting her grave, his disposing of Blofeld(John Hollis, a Telly Savalas look-a-like, treated as a caricature)in a helicopter that was wired from a remote control device with the plan going awry, and the toss of the top hat as it instantly finds it's place on the rack of M's office. While Bond finds some time to bed a few ladies, he seems far less sidetracked and more determined to complete the mission\/agenda. This is clearly a film directed in tone retracing the Bond character back to the golden years of Sean Connery, while still maintaining it's tongue-in-cheek humor, there's more emphasis on the action, less on goofy comedy bits and preponderance for silly special effects. Topol is a welcome presence as a likable criminal, who lends great support to Bond when he so desperately needs it, and FOR YOUR EYES ONLY rescued Moore from his character becoming an absolute clown. While I welcome gadgets, I was pleased with the decision to take this particular Bond film in an opposite direction, where the effects are not heavily relied upon to increase wonder and excitement. And, the villains in this film are less cartoonish and more realistic, with our Bond babe able to participate a bit more in assisting our hero. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"}]
