The story is corny and really not science fiction at all (it's fantasy--there IS a difference!), the acting is not very good (especially not Mark Hamill, the main character, who is just sort of bland-o), and though the special effects were groundbreaking in 1977, if the movie were released today they would only be so-so. I think the reason for the film's continued popularity is because at the time it was released, the enormous baby boom generation were all teens and twenty-somethings, the right age market for a movie of this type. Now they've all told their kids about how *great* it was, and now *they're* all flocking to see it, just like their parents did, based only on what they've heard. The forty- and fiftysomethings love it because it reminds them of when they were young too. It's nothing more than nostalgia and word of mouth. Why this movie instead of others that were released in the late '70's? Well, perhaps because it *is* the first movie released with the type of overblown special effects we've all gotten used to in science fiction movies. Hollywood just doesn't know what makes a good movie anymore. I suppose story, script and acting don't matter. Just lots of eye-candy. And this has always appealed to a young market. Like I said, if this same movie were released today for the first time, it would be quickly forgotten. I find it reprehensible that this type of comic-book action flick is now the definition of science fiction. It's nothing more than fantasy; true science fiction makes you think. The best example of a *good* science fiction movie is still 2001 A Space Odyssey. A more recent example is  the underrated Contact. No, neither of these movies have laser-gun battles, cutesie-pie aliens, or dark space lords. But those are the creations of Hollywood and really have nothing to do with science. My point is not to ruin anyone's good time--it's a harmless movie and fine for kids to watch and for middle-agers with arrested development still living with their parents, but it should be pointed out that this overrated movie is mediocre Hollywood entertainment, *not* great movie-making. I rest my case.

Now they've all told their kids about how *great* it was, and now *they're* all flocking to see it, just like their parents did, based only on what they've heard. The forty- and fiftysomethings love it because it reminds them of when they were young too. It's nothing more than nostalgia and word of mouth. Why this movie instead of others that were released in the late '70's? Well, perhaps because it *is* the first movie released with the type of overblown special effects we've all gotten used to in science fiction movies. Hollywood just doesn't know what makes a good movie anymore. I suppose story, script and acting don't matter. Just lots of eye-candy. And this has always appealed to a young market. Like I said, if this same movie were released today for the first time, it would be quickly forgotten. I find it reprehensible that this type of comic-book action flick is now the definition of science fiction. It's nothing more than fantasy; true science fiction makes you think. The best example of a *good* science fiction movie is still 2001 A Space Odyssey. A more recent example is  the underrated Contact. No, neither of these movies have laser-gun battles, cutesie-pie aliens, or dark space lords. But those are the creations of Hollywood and really have nothing to do with science. My point is not to ruin anyone's good time--it's a harmless movie and fine for kids to watch and for middle-agers with arrested development still living with their parents, but it should be pointed out that this overrated movie is mediocre Hollywood entertainment, *not* great movie-making.

Peter Weir's direction and feel for the movie made it absolutely awesome. He took what could have been a strange, goofy movie, and turned it into an almost religious experience. He also chose to not tell us what happens after Truman leaves the studio. A wise decision, as some would be tempted to show what happens next. But an intelligent artist knows you should always leave the auidence wanting more. And that is what he has done, yet it is still satisfying. Jim Carrey's performance is excellent. He's funny, but he plays Truman as a tortured soul, and because of the depth of his performance, you can't help but feel tremendous pity for Truman. You almost feel proud when he reaches the edge of his world. Philip Glass and Burkhard Dallwitx both worked on the score, and both composers worked perfectly. Instead of using one composer for the film, using one theme, Weir stole certain bits because they fit his movie so perfectly. When Truman falls in love with a beautiful woman, and tries to talk to her, a piece by Chopin palys. A composer hired to write music for the movie wouldn't have been as good for that specific scene. Dallwitz's score was almost sparse, but it perfectly fit the mood of the story. It was manipulative. This whole movie is. You'll wonder if THEY want you to like the movie. There wasn't a single element that didn't work perfectly. this movie lacked violence, sex, foul language, and all the other filth that movies have today. That's what sets it apart from others, to me. Pleasantville is often compared to the Truman Show, but only because they both deal with TV as subject matter. In fact, these movies are radically different. The Truman Show is an innocent movie with a darker, more ominous undertone to it, that has a message to it. It's funny, touching, and thought provoking. Pleasantville is about teenagers who fornicate. It's full of smut, and at its core, there's nothing but filth and a shallow story that seriously strains credibility. If you enjoy intelligent movies, and hate it when people walk out of movies like Armageddon, saying that was AWESOME, then PLEASE see the Truman Show.

Yet the sweetness, the innocence remains -- held true in the character of Babe and the determined naievety of Mrs. Hoggett.  The action goes completely goofy at times -- very slapstick -- and at other times the screen is filled with grim, gloomy images that might horrify anyone, not just children.  In other words, it is a good old fashioned fairy tale. Now, I love the first Babe a great deal, and have been accused of reading too much into such a simple story. But Joseph Campbell and George Lucas have taught us that this is one purpose of a simple story -- a myth -- the hero's journey.  Babe is indeed the hero -- the soul who begins from a point of innocence and travels to darker lands -- even the Underworld -- to bring back some gift or knowledge.  Babe's Underworld is literally any and all cities.  The view from his window includes the Eifel Tower, the World Trade center, the Sydney Opera House and the Hollywood sign.  He meets new companions, some of dubious trustworthiness, and it seems that in this hard cruel place kindess is gone from everywhere but Babe's heart.  That kindness ultimately redeems the sad, cynical (and very funny) members of the city menagerie. This film seems to me to have a great deal in common with The Empire Strikes Back -- another second act, another movie labeled as too dark and full of absurd humor.  I hope Mr. Miller will give his Luke-Skywalker-on-trotters an opportunity to bring his journey full circle. Will we see Return of the Sheep-Pig?  I hope so... Magda Szubanski is utterly delightful in her reprise as Mrs. Hoggett.  And watch for the hotel proprietress -- Wallace and Grommit fans are in for a treat.  The new city-dwellers are well-drawn and very funny (listen for Stephen Wright - he is hysterical!) and Ferdinand is a companion in the best Han-Solo tradition.  My favorite moment -- the mice do an Edith Piaf turn. If you give your children edited versions of Grimm's Fairy Tales, don't take them to see this film.  But DO see it yourself.

Yet the sweetness, the innocence remains -- held true in the character of Babe and the determined naievety of Mrs. Hoggett.  The action goes completely goofy at times -- very slapstick -- and at other times the screen is filled with grim, gloomy images that might horrify anyone, not just children.  In other words, it is a good old fashioned fairy tale. Now, I love the first Babe a great deal, and have been accused of reading too much into such a simple story. But Joseph Campbell and George Lucas have taught us that this is one purpose of a simple story -- a myth -- the hero's journey.  Babe is indeed the hero -- the soul who begins from a point of innocence and travels to darker lands -- even the Underworld -- to bring back some gift or knowledge.  Babe's Underworld is literally any and all cities.  The view from his window includes the Eifel Tower, the World Trade center, the Sydney Opera House and the Hollywood sign.  He meets new companions, some of dubious trustworthiness, and it seems that in this hard cruel place kindess is gone from everywhere but Babe's heart.  That kindness ultimately redeems the sad, cynical (and very funny) members of the city menagerie.

I understand they were trying to play up the human interest aspect, but some of the behaviours were so unrealistic - the way the reporter gives up her life for the woman and child, the way 250 or so million Americans calmly accepted that they were going to die but a privileged few would survive. The saving of earth was also way too pat. The main redeeming feature was the tidal wave special effects - truly spectacular. Unfortunately these only lasted for a few seconds and we had seen most of them before in trailers anyway.
