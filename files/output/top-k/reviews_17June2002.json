He used to play cards for serious money, but as we see in the first few minutes of the film, he blows a lot of money on one hand, and decides to give up poker for a while. Here's one problem I had. He's in law school, and said he used the poker money to pay for his tuition, and I'm assuming his nice New York apartment with his girlfriend. Once he stops playing cards, and drives a truck around all night, how in the hell does he still pay tuition? I don't think you make enough money driving a delivery truck around, to pay for tuition and an apartment. When Mike's best friend from his younger days (Worm, played by Edward Norton) gets out of prison, Mike goes to pick him up. Worm immediately wants to get into a game of poker, and to bring Mike along with him. Mike says no, but we all know whats going to happen. Mike jumps back into the game, loses his girlfriend, gets beat up, owes money to the Russian Mob, uses a lot of technical card playing terms, and comes out clean in the end. Like in Rocky III where Rocky gets his ass kicked by Mr. T early in the movie, then fights his way back to win in the end.  Wait, doesn't that happen in all the Rocky movies? The movie is predictable, no question about that. So what you need are strong, likeable characters to help push you through that. So let's run down the major characters in the film.Matt Damon's Mike McDermott - I liked him. Damon has a regular guy charm about him that makes him stand out from the rest. So I liked his character.Edward Norton's Worm - Didn't like him at all. But I think I wasn't supposed to, so that's good. All Worm did was try and destroy both himself and Mike. I think it was because he felt the only way he could get Mike's attention, was by bringing Mike down with him. But his abrupt departure near the end of the film left me hanging. Mike's girlfriend Jo (Grechen Mol) - Didn't like her at all. First of all, why is there all this hubub about her being the next big girl? She was only in the movie for a few minutes, and her character annoyed the hell out of me. All she did was whine and question every move Mike made. I think if they had added a little more to Mike and Jo's background story, this would have made more sense, but as it stands, she came off as being whiny and annoying.Mike's law school professor Abe Peterovsky (Martin Landau) - He was supposed to be the moral center of this movie. Yet his major thing was basically to tell Mike that he should leave law school and play cards. What kind of professor would say that? And what he does near the end of the movie is almost unbelievable. Like the actor, didn't like the role.Lastly I'll do John Malkovich as Teddy KGB - KGB is the owner of a major illegal underground poker house. He also happens to have ties to the Russian Mob. Malkovich plays him with this over the top accent, but makes him a great character at the same time. He was there as the bad guy to Mike's good guy, and pulled it off amazingly. So I liked this character.There were others to be sure, John Tuturro and Famke Janssen among others, in the film that sort of helped the (plot?) along. Overall though, I found I didn't like or understand a lot of the characters. What made this movie were Matt Damon and John Malkovich. Thankfully, the movie centered on Damon, and his enemy in the film was Malkovich, which made the movie entertaining and something worth seeing. You probably need to be a Matt Damon fan to really enjoy Rounders. But at the same time, if you've never seen a Matt Damon film (and why haven't you seen Good Will Hunting yet?) this is a good one to see as well. Damon does have the ability to be the next big thing, if he isn't already.

Written by Tony Gilroy, adapted from the novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum. Starring Matt Damon and Franka Potente. Support from Chris Cooper.Jason Bourne (Damon) is pulled out of the Mediterranean by fishermen who at first think him dead. But he revives, and one of the fishermen, who apparently practices surgery as a hobby, digs two bullets out of his back and a small capsule out of his hip. The capsule contains the access number of a Swiss bank account. Having been deposited by the fishermen on the Marseilles waterfront, Bourne heads for Switzerland and the numbered account. He has lost his memory, although he finds he knows English, French, and German, and in an early run-in with two Zurich cops who are hassling him as a homeless person, he discovers he is exceedingly proficient in martial arts as well. The next day, he goes to the bank, signs in to the account, and finds in the safe deposit box numerous passports in his and others' names, all bearing his picture. Also, there are substantial sums of money in various currencies, as well as a gun. He leaves the gun and takes the rest in a red bank bag. His movements are reported back to a CIA operations chief (Cooper) in Langley, who is reeling from Bourne's failure to assassinate an African leader (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who was powerful as Simon Adebisi in the tv series, Oz ). Fearing that Bourne has at the very least compromised the covert op-and may even have turned renegade-he orders Bourne killed. Seeking his identity and suspicious of what his past must have been, Bourne goes to the U.S. Consulate, where he finds himself pursued by Marine guards. Escaping the Consulate, he meets up with a vagabond young woman, Marie Kreutz (Potente) and offers her $20,000 to drive him to Paris, where one of his aliases, a Mr. Kane, has an apartment. There he finds himself the target of assassins. He doesn't know who is after him, or why, but ironically, the skills he has learned in that very life that now demands his demise, are all that keep him going. That and Marie's little red car.This one is a boy's adventure fantasy with archetypal subtext. Nearly all the physical action is of the don't try this at home variety. But it is, for the most part, very well done, almost to the point of being believable. Given that one goes into this genre willing to suspend a whole lot of disbelief, the action is certainly acceptable, all except for one five or six story plunge down a stairwell, which one might accept only in a super-hero movie. Martial arts and car chases are not among my favorite story elements, but Liman gives us only one, maybe two, encounters that shout obligatory martial arts ballet. Others of his fights are quick and to the point, the way serious martial arts fighting would be in real life.As for car chases, although I am no connoisseur, I've always thought the car-chases-train sequence in The French Connection to be the best chase I've ever seen. I'd say that Liman equals that masterpiece when he has the Parisian gendarmes chase Bourne and Marie through the streets of Paris in their little red car. I find Damon convincing as an action hero, and Potente's character exudes the aura of a side-street, bathed in shadows and mist, which the pursued hero can duck into for respite. I love the way she lets the action come to her and then responds in a spontaneous and wholly believable manner that scarcely requires words. Their relationship is chaste. They share a slightly awkward hug and kiss at one point. Would one wish for more chemistry between them? Well, Bourne does have a few things on his mind which are a bit more demanding of his attention than a sexual romp. I guess what I would have liked is for Marie to have mothered him, and for Bourne to have responded to her with more vulnerability. I know that he has had the vulnerability all but trained out of him, and he can't afford to let his guard down, but I would have wished for some embrace of genuine respite in which he accepts and succumbs to his need for her to hold him and make it all better. Not to get too Oedipal about it, but Bourne has been reborn, having been all but dead and then passing through a symbolic, watery rebirth by which he has shed his past and has a chance to follow his better instincts-once he discovers what they are, for they can only be determined in contrast with what he once was. And Marie does have an accepting, protective attitude toward him, which, under more favorable circumstances, could blossom into the love of a lover. For lovers, at their best, mother each other as well.I wish Liman had brought out that aspect of their relationship more, expanding the story's human dimension. But even as it is, he respects the reality of his characters and situations more than one finds in most action-adventure movies, and he handles them skillfully.

Written by Tony Gilroy, adapted from the novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum. Starring Matt Damon and Franka Potente. Support from Chris Cooper.Jason Bourne (Damon) is pulled out of the Mediterranean by fishermen who at first think him dead. But he revives, and one of the fishermen, who apparently practices surgery as a hobby, digs two bullets out of his back and a small capsule out of his hip. The capsule contains the access number of a Swiss bank account. Having been deposited by the fishermen on the Marseilles waterfront, Bourne heads for Switzerland and the numbered account. He has lost his memory, although he finds he knows English, French, and German, and in an early run-in with two Zurich cops who are hassling him as a homeless person, he discovers he is exceedingly proficient in martial arts as well. The next day, he goes to the bank, signs in to the account, and finds in the safe deposit box numerous passports in his and others' names, all bearing his picture. Also, there are substantial sums of money in various currencies, as well as a gun. He leaves the gun and takes the rest in a red bank bag. His movements are reported back to a CIA operations chief (Cooper) in Langley, who is reeling from Bourne's failure to assassinate an African leader (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who was powerful as Simon Adebisi in the tv series, Oz ). Fearing that Bourne has at the very least compromised the covert op-and may even have turned renegade-he orders Bourne killed. Seeking his identity and suspicious of what his past must have been, Bourne goes to the U.S. Consulate, where he finds himself pursued by Marine guards. Escaping the Consulate, he meets up with a vagabond young woman, Marie Kreutz (Potente) and offers her $20,000 to drive him to Paris, where one of his aliases, a Mr. Kane, has an apartment. There he finds himself the target of assassins. He doesn't know who is after him, or why, but ironically, the skills he has learned in that very life that now demands his demise, are all that keep him going. That and Marie's little red car.This one is a boy's adventure fantasy with archetypal subtext. Nearly all the physical action is of the don't try this at home variety. But it is, for the most part, very well done, almost to the point of being believable. Given that one goes into this genre willing to suspend a whole lot of disbelief, the action is certainly acceptable, all except for one five or six story plunge down a stairwell, which one might accept only in a super-hero movie.

I can't figure out why so many people didn't like it.  I mean it have a 4.7 overall rating at this website.?.First of all, I'm too young to remember the TV series, so I can't compare this movie to that, but regardless, this was one of the better sci-fi films I've seen. Lost In Space takes place in the year 2058. All of Earth's natural resources are dwindling, and within the next twenty years, no life will be able to survive. So the people in charge of such things have been searching the universe for water and things humans need to survive, and they find some on a distant planet, somewhere else in the universe. So Dr. Robinson (William Hurt) takes his family on the ship Jupiter 2, to help colonize the planet, so that future generations may survive. The ship is piloted by Major John West (Matt LeBlanc), and is sabotaged by Dr. Smith (Gary Oldman). Well, as the title suggests, they get lost somewhere in space, and can't figure out a way to get back home. But strange things happen. They run across a ship, built by their federation, but unlike any ship they've seen before. Then these strange spiders attack them. And all hell breaks loose. The plot isn't all that important really, especially when you (and they) come to a certain realization about half way through the film. I won't give it all away, but it's another one of those things where if you think about it too hard, it won't make sense.But as far as the special effects go, they were pretty amazing. Things that you know are blue (or green) screened look more and more realistic. The look of the movie, in the costumes and the sets, are pretty remarkable. The most remarkable aspect of this film was the sound, it was incredible. Maybe it's my home theater system, but I don't remember a movie's special effects sounding so good before. Matt LeBlanc breaks away from his Friends character, and does a great job. I was impressed, especially since his last choice of movies was with an ape. The rest of the cast did a good job, although I did get tired of Dr. Smith's continual snide remarks. And I didn't understand his character all that much after he sabotaged the mission. I mean, if the only way to get back to civilization depended on these people, why would you continue to try and hurt them? He couldn't make it back on his own, yet he always tried to hurt them. And what was up with the little creature they picked up along the way? Does anyone else think that he was there, just so they had some stuffed animal they could sell to little kids?Overall, I did enjoy the movie. The first sixty to ninety minutes very exciting, and action packed. When they landed on the strange planet, things started to bog down, as they tried to give you more of a story. But there was a big blow up ending, and as always, they leave room for a sequel. I'd say this was definitely a good movie to see in the theaters. Those of you who missed it will just have to wait for the re-release.

The minds behind the successful Dumb and Dumber and the overlooked Kingpin have concocted an outrageous batch of gags and assembled a game cast to embody them. Ben Stiller is Rhode Island Ted, a nerdy, mouth-full-of-metal highschooler who has a crush on the impossibly tall, blonde and beautiful Mary (Cameron Diaz). Much to his surprise, she becomes his date to the prom. Well, almost. A nasty close encounter with the aforementioned zipper dashes his hopes of romance on the dance floor. Thirteen years later, Ted, with the braces (and zipper) now removed, is still thinking of Mary. You see, there is definitely something special about Mary. He has her located in Miami by hiring a sleaze ball private investigator (Matt Dillon), and the obsession continues. Stiller is endearing as smitten Ted and Diaz is absolutely charming as Mary. No doubt, there's something about Cameron. You can easily see why she is driving everyone crazy. A terrific supporting cast including Dillon, Lee Evans, Chris Elliot and Green Bay Packer Brett Favre, add laughs. Quite astonishing is Lin Shaye as Mary's ever-present neighbor, Magda, whose bleached-blonde bouffant is way beyond white and whose dangerously tanned skin reminds me of a top-quality Naugahyde sofa.
