The film is a series of episodes linked by the 10 year quest for a niece stolen by Indians as a child. Wayne's Ethan Edwards, an embittered Confederate veteran shows only hatred for all redskins and is uncomprimising in his intended treatment of his niece when he finds her. Modern cinema audiences may find this uncomfortable, especially since western folklore has been reassessed over the last 20 years. But don't let this put you off. Ford's treatment is a modern allegory and Ethan can be forgiven his sins when, at the final denoument, one act of kindness gives us hope, and we feel Ethan has learned an important lesson. Tolerance. Everything about this film makes it a classic and perhaps the best in its genre. Ford's direction is as impeccable as ever, Frank Nugent's script and Winton Hoch's cinematography give us some of the classic images of the cinema. John Wayne, as ever, doesn't even need to act.

In other recent action feast, (Ronin, Rush Hour) the story has two different perspectives on the villain plot. The first takes a look at the bad guys from the good guys point of view. The second is the opposite. Now, what The Siege does that makes it so original is completely eliminating the scoundrel's position in the story. Taking only into perspective the good guys. It defiantly has its problems, but it is a fresh feeling idea.The story involves a continuous act of terrorism in the state of New York, committed by the Arabs. At first sight, this would seem like a simple crime. But as the destruction cost rises, and as the body count increases rapidly, soon, there seems to be a bit more to this scandal then meets the eye.Denzel Washington and Annette  Bening play New York City cops in a race against time to find out the truth behind these acts. After a disastrous bus incident, they come to the conclusion that these people only want to be heard and seen, not necessarily negotiate.Soon, however, a state of martial law is declared, and the movie awkwardly tries to change villains. In this act, the head leader of the tanks that are plowing through the streets going from house to house looking for Arabs, innocent or guilty, and putting them in prison camps, is played by Bruce Willis receptively. Although he over-reacts often, I still felt that Willis was quite the expert at his role.But he becomes too involved in what he does and puts a man though torture who refuses to talk. This is taking away the American's freedom and not many people like this. So how is the FBI going to deal with the constant acts of terrorism, and their own army who turns against them?There is one main problem I had with this movie We never find out who the master bad guy is. I mentioned earlier on in my review that there was a couple of flaws to the main original look at the movie. If there is no bad-guy point of view, how do we know who the bad guys are. Figuring that out is very confusing, and shortly I gave up on it.However, that flaw, and the overall film itself, is elevated from the first rate performances. Washington gives one of his better acting jobs of the year. His confusion seemed realistic and his pondering was fiercely involving.

I liked the way she presented her character in the wild but cautious girl way.I had another serious concern for the films first half The script is often somewhat tedious. And with the dialog these characters have to work with, the entire movie becomes nothing but painful ho-hum. But without warning signs, there suddenly is an action sequence that saves the movie tactlessly.

Based on the autobiographical story of J.G. Ballard (Crash), Spielberg weaves a fascinating story of the fall of China during WWII and the effect it had on the psyche of the ruling British class.  Although there are a number of memorable scenes during the film, three stand out as truly outstanding an early scene in which the young boy (played without any cloying sentimentality by Christian Bale) weaves through the hectic, riot filled streets in his father's limousine; the scene which depicts his ingenuity in the detention facility; and most memorably, the scene of the American liberation in which he climbs to the top of the building and waves at a beloved fighter plane as it passes by in slow motion.  I would also recommend the soundtrack by John Williams which is rather understated for him and includes Chinese folksongs being sung by an English boys' choir...breathtaking.  Truly a remarkable film.
