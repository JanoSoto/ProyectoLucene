I felt how the magic of Titanic really got to me, and when the credits came in my face was flooded with tears.Perhaps what I like the most about this movie is how it has made me feel. Yeah, it has made me feel things I had never felt before. For instance, I had never cried with a movie. And it wasn't just the sad romantic story that involved the two characters - but how all the characters that had interacted with them died one by one, sunk with the Ship of Dreams. Mr. Andrews, Captain Smith, little Cora, Mr. Murdoch, Tommy, Fabrizio...because Titanic isn't just a romantic movie, it's also a historic movie that shows what happened on a fatal April 14 morning, in 1912. One thousand fifty souls sunk down along with the Titanic into the deep waters of the Northern Atlantic, and I could see all that pain and suffering portrayed in James Cameron's movie perfectly. And it was during that dramatic hour, sitting still at the movie theater, in which tears dared to slide down my cheeks, along with most of the other viewers.As the movie credits slid by in the theater screen, my brother asked me if I was crying, and I shook my head.

There are very few laughs in this film, maybe two, and both of those were ad-libs that Grant brought in. I cannot for the life of me understand why anybody would think the script fine! It is tedious, with the gags very broad and so drawn out that they continue for several minutes after the punch line has already occurred. The bit about the leopard's mating cry is atrociously dumb and unfunny and goes on literally forever! Cary Grant is a wonderful performer and he does his best here but it can't save the flick from being a turkey. Evidently the writers fell in love while working on the script - too busy getting off with each other to turn in a decent job perhaps? The script stinks! It's no surprise to me that people didn't rate this film when it first came out nor that it languished for 20 years until Bogdanovich revived it. It is DEFINITELY a case of Hollywood revisionism (as Jadedalex put it) that this third-rate nonsensical caper is now somehow regarded as one of the best movies ever made. That claim is far, far funnier than anything in the movie! I watched this film today, well aware of its reputation and eager to catch a great film classic. I was very disappointed and was left feeling completely bewildered by the (belated) rave reviews. The condescending person on here who assumes that people who don't find the film funny are lacking in film knowledge is completely incorrect. Personally, I love old movies from the 30s and 40s and understand the differences in style and so forth. But unfunny is unfunny, regardless of genre, time period, style, or whatever. The best thing about the film is Skippy, the terrier who also starred as Asta in the Thin Man films, and is a wonderful lively presence; his scene playing with the leopard is adorable. Skippy also has some of the best lines woof, woof, woof. Far wittier than 99% of the human dialogue. It bothers me that people think is a great film.

Well anyway this is a remake of the 1967 Point Blank that starred Lee Marvin and John Vernon. The original broke new ground for its time, and it is a classic, and it showed just how terrific an actor Lee Marvin was. In fact the whole cast was memorable.Payback in the version I saw is the director's cut and it's a good movie, not excellent by any means, but good, watchable, and tight. Apparently an earlier version was messed up, and many reviews here are of that version.The story is simple. Gibson is betrayed by a partner in crime who takes his share of the loot (robbed from some other bad guys) and joins the Outfit. Gibson, left for dead, recovers and goes up against the Outfit and some corrupt cops to recover his loot. Since it's a case of one bad guy going up against other bad (even worse) guys, we are able to identify with Gibson. After all, he was almost killed by his partner.Now, there are some story changes that need not detain us. They do not really enhance the new version over the old. In the old one, Marvin lost his two-timing woman to his buddy, and that twist is gone.I really did not want to compare Marvin to Gibson, whose acting I respect, but I could not help but notice the vast difference in how they handled the part. Marvin did a far better job at it. Sorry, Mel. I like your work a lot, but Lee managed to convey all the emotions, from anger to steely determination to humor and more, much better. Gibson gave us a kind of stolid one-note bull-headedness.The new version injects some of the pretensions and tone of this newer age of movies, and these do not help this film or modern films in general. In particular, every so often (usually way too often) there is a kind of juvenile joking around, sometimes swearing, sometimes over the top bits of behavior or dialogue, that detract from the seriousness of the story. These alter the tone of the movie. They break the mood. They detract from the movie's realism. Too many people at too many times behave like children or make wisecracks that are childish or out of place or counter the mood. They break down the flow of tension and suspense, and they ruin any hope of presenting a story that has integrity from start to finish.It is totally unimaginable that the kinds of things I am talking about would ever appear in La Strada or The Asphalt Jungle or Flamingo Road or The Strange Love of Martha Ivers, or any number of films like these. They had humor at times, they had humanity, they had all sorts of human behavior, and it seemed more real and more grown up and more believable. The modern injections of pretensions are as if the writers are afraid to write something strong and see it through, all the way through, without interrupting it with some nonsense.Payback had mercifully few of these moments, but it had some. It did not escape this general curse that undercuts the seriousness of the story and thus its capacity to engage the viewer, or at least this viewer who is used to older movies and who is continually giving newer movies serious consideration. But I must say that even without these awkward moments, I am not seeing levels of emotion conveyed or conflicts brought out except at relatively superficial levels in many scenes. It's like seeing a cartoon substitute for a painting that has many shades. Exaggeration does not substitute well for true dramatic conflict.Overall, Payback is pretty much by the modern numbers while utilizing some of the Point Blank story.

Alien 3 was his directorial debut, and he was given a massive $50 million budget to play with, in addition to having to live up to fans' expectations after the previous two marvellous films, Alien and Aliens, directed by Ridley Scott and the unsinkable James Cameron respectively. He had to start shooting without a script, and 20th Century Fox stuck their noses in the production so many times that I'm surprised he finished the film. But he did. And after all of that, the film turned out just as one would expect with all that going on &#x96; messy.While the first Alien film finishes with Ripley shooting off into space as the lone survivor, with an unknown future ahead of her, the second film shows Ripley accompanied by two other characters (and a damaged robot). Alien 3 had so much potential to capitalise on this, and utilise Hicks and Newt to a great extent, giving Ripley a family of companions to accompany her through her battle with the creatures and The Company. But no. They are callously killed off in the opening titles, with seldom time to mourn them. This is the film's first big mistake, and is guaranteed to leave Aliens fans a little peeved.The prison story is interesting enough, as Ripley is the lone woman on a barren prison planet full of deadly convicts. Moving on to Alien 3's next big mistake the creature itself. Quite radically re-designed, this creature seems much less deadly than in previous films, exacerbated further by the tacky special effects. Having spent much of the first two films seeing very little of the creature, which builds fear and tension superbly, this film shows you a little too much, and one realises that the little Xenomorph isn't actually all that scary.Nonetheless, the film isn't an entire disaster. Sigourney Weaver gives a naturally excellent performance, along with the rest of the cast doing a fine job as well. Furthermore, the musical score in the film is, in my opinion, the best in the Alien franchise. (This is understandable, as composer Elliot Goldenthal was given an entire year alongside David Fincher to finish the score, as opposed to the six or so weeks given to James Horner for Aliens.) And, last but not least, the film's emotional final scene is very well written, with great performances all round. The scene could (and probably should) have given a satisfying conclusion to the franchise, before the nightmarish Alien Resurrection.Overall, while the film makes the best out of a bad situation, the problems shine through, and there are far too many flaws in the film to consider it a classic. I wouldn't go so far as to say that Alien 3 and its sequel ruin the franchise, but they most certainly put a downer on it. Alien 3 is probably the worst film of the four. But it's alright, I guess.

My only gripe was the odd pat on the back style lines that slipped in here and there, motivational war speeches after seeing the light etc but they certainly don't detract from what is an epic movie. The odd corny line here and there is almost unmeasurable in this 2hr40min marathon of high octane action and passionately acted masterpiece.Still find it hard to believe it was filmed in 1999!! Seems like it was just released this year every time I watch it (5 times now). Each character is integral to his or her own part and you're never left wondering why they had a part in the first place. Whether it's Pacino's lead role on film or Lauren Holly's minor character of Quaid's Cap Rooney wife.....they all have fantastic screen presence and have you relating to them straight away. Life and death struggles was a bit of an overstated tag line, but certainly you start to bond and feel every painful emotion and physical blow the team (Miami Sharks) endure.I personally haven't felt an emotional football or even sports movie like this since All The Right Moves back in the early 80's with Tom Cruise. From Pacino and Foxx down to minor coaching cameo actors, they all have 3 dimensional roles. This movie could've easily have been over 3 hours long and it would still be over too quick. I only wish that Oliver Stone would direct a hockey epic like this instead of the comedy mishaps we always get like Slap Shot, Youngblood and Goon!! A solid 8\/10 for a film that brings out some of the best performances from Pacino, Quaid & James Woods. Foxx is brilliant in making you feel compassion early on for his character to feeling utter disdain and contempt as his alter-ego grows and grows and loses touch with why he started playing football in the first place.

The second problem for me was how the entire movie was built up for us to find out who Gabby's parents are, but we never find out.

But what the hell, what is it all about, why was it on the 'video nasties' list. We all know that the list of 'video nasties' was a list with mostly boring flicks that had nothing special to offer. But they were on the list because when the boom of VHS happened in the UK the covers were mostly nasty or gory or had sexual pictures. So the list was one big joke. I wont go further into the story but The Funhouse is another perfect example of why it was put on the list. The name Tobe Hooper did ring a bell, he was the director of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974). One that was banned for more than 20 years in the UK but never was put on the nasties list but still, Tobe was a bad man back then. If you watch The Funhouse then you will see that it really is a slow starter. It takes almost more than half this flick before things really go wrong with the children attending the funhouse. But what a great opening sequence this flick had, an ode to old school horrors. The first thing I was surprised of was the juggs shown by 19 year old Elizabeth Berridge. From there on it's classic galore. We see someone picking up a mask just like in Halloween, even the way it was shot reminded me of Halloween (1978), then we see the shower scene, did that ring a bell, yep, Psycho (1960). All that terror is going on while the parents are watching Bride Of Frankenstein (1935) on television. But it goes further. Rick Barker (special effects) even made a mask that looked like the monster in Frankenstein, by which I mean the Universal classic. So far so good but as I said, from there it all falls a bit down. It is even so that I haven't seen any red stuff to mention let's even say gore. The whole flick is created on the atmosphere of the carnival and especially the funhouse. It isn't a slasher but still it's a feed towards the killer. For a Tobe Hooper flick it's well directed and still even as you get through the first half you want to know what will happen with the children. For the time it was made, the heydays of the slashers it was low on everything but the acting saved the flick and it became collectible due the 'video nasties' list.Elisabeth went further to perform in Amadeus two years later and is still busy at this writing. Shawn Carson, (Joey Harper) as a kid went further to another classic Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983) but it was also his last flick. Another name that made it was Cooper Huckabee (Buzz Dawson) who is seen in True Blood as Joe Lee Mickens and is at the moment busy making an exploitation with Quentin Tarantino, the notorious Django Unchained. Others went further uncredited in other horrors like Jeepers Creepers II (Largo Woodruff) and some did went further as a B-actor in major flicks like Kevin Conway.So much is said about The Funhouse but for people who do want the full 'video nasties' list in their collection pick it up, for others who like for example the original House Of Wax (1953) it's also a recommendation.

But what the hell, what is it all about, why was it on the 'video nasties' list. We all know that the list of 'video nasties' was a list with mostly boring flicks that had nothing special to offer. But they were on the list because when the boom of VHS happened in the UK the covers were mostly nasty or gory or had sexual pictures. So the list was one big joke. I wont go further into the story but The Funhouse is another perfect example of why it was put on the list. The name Tobe Hooper did ring a bell, he was the director of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974). One that was banned for more than 20 years in the UK but never was put on the nasties list but still, Tobe was a bad man back then. If you watch The Funhouse then you will see that it really is a slow starter. It takes almost more than half this flick before things really go wrong with the children attending the funhouse. But what a great opening sequence this flick had, an ode to old school horrors. The first thing I was surprised of was the juggs shown by 19 year old Elizabeth Berridge. From there on it's classic galore. We see someone picking up a mask just like in Halloween, even the way it was shot reminded me of Halloween (1978), then we see the shower scene, did that ring a bell, yep, Psycho (1960). All that terror is going on while the parents are watching Bride Of Frankenstein (1935) on television. But it goes further. Rick Barker (special effects) even made a mask that looked like the monster in Frankenstein, by which I mean the Universal classic. So far so good but as I said, from there it all falls a bit down. It is even so that I haven't seen any red stuff to mention let's even say gore. The whole flick is created on the atmosphere of the carnival and especially the funhouse. It isn't a slasher but still it's a feed towards the killer. For a Tobe Hooper flick it's well directed and still even as you get through the first half you want to know what will happen with the children. For the time it was made, the heydays of the slashers it was low on everything but the acting saved the flick and it became collectible due the 'video nasties' list.Elisabeth went further to perform in Amadeus two years later and is still busy at this writing. Shawn Carson, (Joey Harper) as a kid went further to another classic Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983) but it was also his last flick. Another name that made it was Cooper Huckabee (Buzz Dawson) who is seen in True Blood as Joe Lee Mickens and is at the moment busy making an exploitation with Quentin Tarantino, the notorious Django Unchained. Others went further uncredited in other horrors like Jeepers Creepers II (Largo Woodruff) and some did went further as a B-actor in major flicks like Kevin Conway.So much is said about The Funhouse but for people who do want the full 'video nasties' list in their collection pick it up, for others who like for example the original House Of Wax (1953) it's also a recommendation.

The sheer drama of the falls merge strikingly into the story as a whole. Some of the camera angles really showcase the waters in their crashing majesty, a sinister backdrop to the shadowy events. Then too, I hope TCF gave poor Jean Peters hazard pay for the way she gets doused around in that little boat. No glamour girl there. I expect the movie's overall quality is due to director Hathaway, long one of Hollywood's most underrated movie makers. Catch, for example, that marvelous overhead shot in the bell tower of Marilyn lying dead. It's a composition worthy of the best of Welles. Also, I kept watching for process shots, Hollywood's usual expedient when dealing with difficult action set-ups. The only one I could spot in that long river sequence is Peters on the rock awaiting rescue. To me, that's quite a feat of expert movie-making.Nothing special about the storyline itself. Faithless wife Monroe two-times her unbalanced husband Cotten who then stalks her amid the touristy Niagara setting. In fact, Cotten gets to do a lot of sinister lurking around. On the other hand, wholesome newly-weds Showalter and Peters make a charming, non-sappy contrast to the other couple-- and I'm not surprised that in real life, the notorious love-'em and leave-'em Howard Hughes ended up marrying the no-nonsense Peters. My only gripe is with the ever-exultant Don Wilson. He was such a good pitch-man on TV, but here it's like he's trying to sell us his glad-handing role instead of acting it out.Anyway, the movie remains more than simply Marilyn's breakthrough role-- good as she is-- and can stand on its own as an expert scenic thriller.

How come there are 2 Razzie Nominations for this movie??? Shelley Duvall nominated for worst actress??? How the hell it was given to her??? Honestly i really think that she is one the reason and character which makes this movie a classic! Let's us think again... Shelley is definitely NOT a pretty woman at all. Nowadays directors only focused on pretty woman and chicks and gave them important roles to make their movie a success, because they thought people would watch pretty woman in a movie instead of judging their acting performances. Well, this does not happens in Kubrick's The Shining.... Shelley was given the role because she is a natural. The role for her perfectly fits her, and she has the ability to control her emotion and tension. She didn't become totally insane and scared because this is how normal people naturally become when something happens. Jack Nicholson has shown a superb acting especially when turning into a maniac! I wonder why he didn't won any Oscar for this kind of performances??? And as for Kubrick...how come he is nominated as the Worst Director???? This is totally insane!!! Come on people...we all knew the Shining is a classic until today! ","genre":null},{"date":"8 April 2012","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" What the hell???

More than a movie Chaplin treated this project as a work of art and beautifully crafted it. I ve not seen his other movies but soon i will check out all of them. The characters are as interesting as the dialogues. There is never a dull moment in the movie. You cant help but notice the wit and intelligence involved in the script writing, as the minutes pass by, once you are into the movie. The comedy comes out as a breath of fresh air and not even close to being dated. Chaplin shows his greatness not only as a writer, director, actor but also a great human being. The final speech is by far one of the best speeches ever you will listen. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.

For one thing the movie is only 90 minutes long and is supposed to cover 800,000 years of history. Three places are visited, and the majority of the movie is spent in a place that looks like the past that is 800,000 years in the future.The movie really has nothing to do with time travel. The book cannot be that bad, and I hope that if I get a chance to read it, it will be a lot better. I want to rent the original and compare it!Horrible movie!2\/10I give it a two because Guy Pearce is an awesome actor and because Memento is one of my favorite movies. It had two much of Guy Pearce in a serious role, when he is a comedic actor. Hell Mark Boone Junior is a major character, and only has a 10 minute role. Just two many things happen that either not explained or don't make any sense for the movie. The one scene that comes to mind is where Mark Boone Junior's character is going to let Guy Pearce leave in the time machine, and for no reason he attacks him. The one thing that Guy Pearce forgets is the only way to change the past is in the past, not the future.
