This failure only serves to highlight the films shallowness of writing and characterisation. This is a shame as the opening hour of the film show real promise of depth and meaning.

While Run, Lola, Run did not require such in-depth explanation, the slow pace of The Princess and the Warrior lends a viewer much more time for reflection on events. However there is little explanation of events to reflect on.The film is beautifully and obviously very expensively shot.

It takes a little while before you realised that the fact that it has made you think as much as it has, is what truly makes it great and therefore because of this it really was an exceptional film.The perspective of this film is the component that makes it stand out above others, the idea of the film starting at the end of the story and then slowly going back through the storyline to where it began is something I've never seen done, in such intensity before, other start at the end and then explain how they got there but this film is well and truly backwards. The use of narration was pivotal in this film, if you didn't have it the storyline would be far to complex and un-understandable to even the most observant of viewers, the narration therefore takes us through each action that is completed, and more importantly is used to emphasise the extent of the memory loss that occurs in the film.Although most questions were answered during this film, I found myself sometimes wondering if I had missed something, some small detail that would have made an action make sense, that I just didn't notice, but the storyline still made sense despite its complexity. The only question I was really left with was, what happens now? Does the vicious cycle just continue on forever, will there ever be an end? However you have to realise that that is the point in the film, your left with as few answers as the main character, and thats what makes it such an interesting journey.Acting in this film was generally good, nothing too special as its this idea of the complexity of the storyline that carries the film forward, but needless to say the relatively small cast pulls the job off well, but I found myself never sure what I was supposed to think of a character, this seems to be the point in the film though.In general I enjoyed this film and really enjoyed the strange perspective used, that is not really evident in other movies.

Basically out of work DJ Zack (Tom Waits) is set up when he is hired by a mob to drive a clean car from a bar to a city but he is arrested when a dead body is found by police in the trunk, and pimp Jack (John Lurie) is set up when one of his enemies sends him to meet a girl who wants to work for him but it turns out it is a child and the police arrest him on molestation charges. Zack and Jack ignore each other for some time, but they do eventually talk about neither one of them being guilty for the crimes they were arrested, there is a point when they come to blows because of the enclosed space and they stop talking. It is only months later when they are joined by a third cell mate, Italian tourist Roberto (Life Is Beautiful's Roberto Benigni) who speaks only a little English but has an enthusiastic and optimistic attitude, despite the fact that he is guilty of his crime on manslaughter. The three prisoners form a close friendship, and Roberto turns out not just to be good company for Zack and Jack, but he has devised a way for the three of them to escape the prison, and soon enough one night they manage to do it. They get away and are forced to run through the swampy wilderness surrounding the prison, and they do whatever they can to avoid detection from the authorities and sniffer dogs searching for them, there is a point when Zack and Jack fall out again and threaten splitting, but Roberto helps again providing food. Eventually the three prisoners find themselves on a road, so they choose a direction to take on it, and they are happy to find a forest house, Roberto is the one that enters and hopes not to be caught out, while the other wait for the all clear, but their friend takes a while. When they enter the house themselves Zack and Jack find that their Italian chum has fallen in love with the lady living there, Nicoletta (Nicoletta Braschi) who is also from Italy, and she allows them to stay with her until the searching by the authorities lessens. In the end, with new clothes, Zack and Jack set about leaving and going their own ways, Roberto says he is going to stay with Nicoletta as they are very much in love, and eventually the two remaining prisoners reach a crossroads, they part on seemingly good terms with hardly any words before they separate opposite directions. Also starring Ellen Barkin as Laurette, Billie Neal as Bobbie, Rockets Redglare as Gig, Vernel Bagneris as Preston, Timothea as Julie, L.C. Drane as L.C., Joy N. Houck Jr. as Detective Mandino and Ralph Joseph as Detective. Waits and Lurie gives great performances as the often argumentative but close friends, with her time on screen Braschi is likable as the girlfriend the foreigner finds, but for me Benigni stole the show as the vibrant Italian who is eager to learn more English, has some clever ideas, displays a great spirit for many things, and is just a lovable character. The story at the beginning is mildly important to see why they are put in their situation, but it is all the action in and escaping from prison that is the most watchable, the conversations inside the cell, and the action as the three friends make their getaway, all this is accompanied by a good script and many funny moments and makes up for a satisfying black comedy.

It means that this is a below-par effort.The story line of cop pursuing serial killer is easy to follow. By now it has become standard, as in many westerns the plots revolve around land disputes. The question is how well it is done and what new twists occur or new insights. In this one, there are two main themes. One is the dependence of the cop's (Spader's) life on pursuit and apprehension of this killer (Reeves) who has followed him from LA to Chicago, since he also depends on Spader to provide him his jollies. The second theme is the atomization of people in a large city and the difficulty of communicating with them on a personal level. Few want to get involved in identifying a threatened person, and those that do may be providing silly information merely to get attention.Yet somehow the first theme of Spader-Reeves symbiosis doesn't come across as convincing. That's one fault. Another is that the Reeves character is not convincing. The movie tends to drag after awhile. Even the obligatory chase scenes seem as if they are not from the heart, despite their decent enough staging. They seem by the numbers. There is something curiously uninvolving about this movie.As in other movies that fall short, I blame the script for failing to introduce sufficient dramatic scenes whereby the nature of the characters is brought out so that viewers understand and engage with them. It's what the script writers do not put on the screen, instead putting wasted scenes on the screen, that matters. It's seems clearer and clearer that Hollywood could use a few top flight script doctors.

There is a lot left unexplained, not the least of which is the priest involved in the case actually going on record and talking about it on the television show In Search Of...; also the basic facts of the tale seem to be undisputed That the Lutzes moved into the house in late December 1975 and fled twenty-eight days later, leaving all their belongings behind. Their property was later retrieved by a moving company but the Lutzes themselves never set foot in the house again after January 1976. This really remains the unanswered question, because nobody moves into a house that they bought for a bargain price only to leave in less than a month unless SOMETHING happened.The book attempts to make a connection between the Lutzes' experience in the house and the murders of the DeFeo family in the same house a little over a year previously; some mention is made of a physical resemblance between Ronnie DeFeo, who murdered his family, and George Lutz, but it's not very convincing. As for the rest, it's mostly your standard horror novel stuff; Anson's writing is persuasive but not compelling, and in the end we're left wondering what really happened.Now to the film. As an adaptation of the book, it is a decent picture, even quite good in some spots, though with James Brolin and Margot Kidder headlining the cast, this was definitely a B project from jump; the presence of Rod Steiger as the priest lends it a touch of class, but director Stuart Rosenberg allows him to overact shamelessly, making what should have been scary somewhat ridiculous. In point of fact it is Brolin and Kidder who acquit themselves fairly well here; Kidder is perfectly believable as the increasingly-terrified wife and mother, and Brolin in particular stands out as the house seems to be doing odd things to George's mind; his silences are at once eloquent and truly scary.Paradoxically, however, the film, while mostly faithful to the book, sort of works against itself in the credibility department, because all the horror movie clichés of time are in place. THE EXORCIST, remember, had created quite the sensation (and gave rise to a million copycats) a scant few years earlier, and at times some of the stuff that happens to the on-screen Lutz family tends to give the viewer a sense of déjà vu.There has been a LOT of controversy about this story, both as told in Anson's book and Rosenberg's film. At the end of the day, trying to decide if any of it actually happened is a frustrating business; there's a lot of contradictory testimony out there, but the basic fact that the Lutzes only lived in the house for twenty-eight days has not as far as I know been disputed, which leaves the obvious question SOMETHING must have happened in that house, but WHAT? And we'll probably never know for sure. George and Kathy Lutz are both dead now, as is Jay Anson, and I have never come across any statements from Kathy's three children, so it is impossible to decide whether their parents made the whole thing up or they are just too freaked to talk about it.The film itself isn't bad, really. It would have been far better for all concerned had Anson's book (and this film) been marketed as fiction rather than fact; as a movie, it is an effective enough B style horror film, with an attractive and not untalented cast, and what few visual effects there are are pulled off both stylishly and convincingly. So perhaps the proper reaction to this story is to enjoy it for what it is and not to look for evidence of anything deeper than a good haunted house tale.Incidentally this thing was remade in 2005; that movie was so bad I didn't make it through the first twenty minutes.

Then there are the Full Moon films that stick with you despite their faults. The Puppetmaster belongs to the third group. To this day, this film has held a place for me where so many have fallen to the wayside. It's one of those few in its genre that has a lasting effect. The script is banal and FARRRRR from spectacular, and yet I can remember most every line of it even though I haven't seen it in six months. The special effects are indeed B-budget, but even so they capture my imagination in ways that some CGI movies today couldn't hope to; the puppets involve me rather than detach me. The theme, performed by Band's brother Richard, cannot be repelled from my mind, while many Big-budget show-tunes escape me only days after I hear them. There's something about this low-budget film that really grabs you. So is not to say that this film is without any flaws. In fact, it's rife with them. On the surface, there are many technical goofs in the film (the scene in the elevator, with Tunneler's arm rods being vaguely visible, is an example.)More internally, the script is weak in one major respect its characters. None of the film's characters feel very real; each feels more like a caricature, made to cater to a certain stereotype or mold. For example,we don't learn much about the character of Dana Hadley, played by Irene Miracle,other than that she's an alcoholic witch. The same can be said about the characters of Frank Forrester and Carissa Stamford; we are led to believe that they are both brilliant minds and lovers, yet all we see are a couple of sex-crazed numb-skulls. The protagonist, Alex Whitaker, played by Paul Le Mat, is one of only two characters that doesn't quite ply into a stereotype. Instead, he's sort of an uninvolved character, who doesn't say much to reveal anything about his personality.And thus, he's sort of a weak protagonist. This is Puppetmaster's biggest problem while the film has the air of mystery and spookiness, the scares aren't as strong because we don't care too much about the characters. The motives of these characters are fairly well-clarified, they're just missing something emotion. I don't recall a single human emotion, other than fear or distaste, being shown to me. And the characters lack that third dimension because of it. If the movie had characters that you could like and feel for on top of its other elements, it would be better twofold because the scares would be more potent. The flaws in character don't mean that Puppetmaster is a bad film. In fact, I very much enjoy this film as well as the series as a whole, and I would recommend at least giving it a try, especially if you're a horror fan. After all, it's only 83 minutes long, and moves quickly. As for me, I'm actually in the process of finalizing my own script for a remake of The Puppetmaster, if only for my own satisfaction in doing so. A remake where you enjoy the puppet master atmosphere, that mystery it has about it, but also feel for the characters, scaring you even more when they are offed.

It's an extended flashback wherein a man in a rest home relates his youth as a death row prison guard in 30s Louisiana, and in particular his experience at the hands of John Coffey. Coffey is a colossal black simpleton who's in for the rape and murder of two white girls, but this is Hollywood circa 1999 so obviously he never done it. On the other hand he has a third eye, can project third-person footage of past events directly onto your mind by grabbing your pods, and can cure anything from the clap to inoperable brain tumours to a malfunctioning moral conscience by inhaling the bad from out of your body, then expelling it as a large swarm of insects (?) He can also bring pulverised mice back from the dead. But not two murdered girls, mind you, because they had been dead for 'too long' and that would just be silly.I know Stephen King novels are notoriously hard to adapt, but...With two exceptions, all the major figures in TGM, including, for all we are shown, the condemned men, are Good. They attempt to do the right thing without fail regardless of consequences, or they are endearingly simple, or, as in Black Jesus' case, both. The two exceptions are such laughable caricatures of evil they might as well have the word of curse tattooed across their foreheads; such manichaean nonsense is not the stuff of great films. All the considerable acting talent on display in this film can't quite bring these cardboard characters to life.The good guys may be Good but they're not particularly effective. They react to the grossest provocations (such as being urinated over by a lag, which I expect would earn you a good kicking in most jurisdictions even today) with stoical good humour such that at times the film succeeds in making a Depression era execution block look like a Butlins run by the Keystone Kops.I took leave of the film at the point when Hanks' character, concerned about his boss' wife's cancer, invites his work buddies to breakfast on the lawn, where he outlines his plan to a) remove what as far as everyone in the world is concerned is a double child rapist \/ murderer from his cell and take him out on the road b) dope another prisoner to cover their tracks and c) lock one of their own colleagues, who is out of the loop, in solitary for the duration, there to produce realistic bangs and moans in order to lead the other prisoners to think (b) is in there instead. All on the off-chance that a man who resurrected a squashed mouse and fixed Hanks' genito-urinary system might be able to cure cancer into the bargain.Needless to say, they agree to this gargantuan lapse of professionalism and sanity almost without hesitation. The obvious question is raised and dismissed in a single sentence. Why not ask the boss to bring her into the prison instead? Because he's cautious and sceptical and therefore wouldn't go for it (who could blame him, really?) But even smashing his door in while he was out, force-feeding his wife sedatives and dragging her to the jail bound and gagged would make more practical sense.What they do instead, then, is to doorstep him, with Coffey, completely unannounced in the wee hours of the morning. Because obviously he is far more likely to react favourably to a home invasion than a polite suggestion over the water cooler. Mr Cautious emerges with a shotgun in a state of some alarm, as one would in the circumstances. But for all his front he still lets them into the house and up the stairs. Now call me wacky but if several men tipped up in uniform at stupid o'clock with a giant murderer in tow who I didn't have a prayer of stopping by physical means, hell bent on entering my terminally ill wife's bedroom with God knows what in mind, but I had a gun to hand I'd have shot every one of the bastards half a dozen times before they got within arm's length.But anyway. Incidentally, the way that Wetmore is set up as a cartoonish prick so that we are almost forced to applaud when his colleagues turn on him is more than ironic for a film that's supposed to warn us against kneejerk reactions.Watching this film, in fact, reminded me how far we have come since the late 90s. TGM with its crude mixture of political correctness and dewy- eyed sentimentality wouldn't pass muster in this age of withering cynicism. I'm not Spike Lee's biggest fan but his criticism of Coffey's character as the archetypal Magickal Negro was on point.Finally, if anyone actually changed their mind about the death penalty on the strength of a film with about as much grounding in reality as Who Framed Roger Rabbit they need to have their right to vote revoked.Two stars for some very solid performances, one more because my wife liked it, plus 'tilt' because the main man died recently and seemed like the kind of fellow you could set your watch by.

All on the off-chance that a man who resurrected a squashed mouse and fixed Hanks' genito-urinary system might be able to cure cancer into the bargain.Needless to say, they agree to this gargantuan lapse of professionalism and sanity almost without hesitation. The obvious question is raised and dismissed in a single sentence. Why not ask the boss to bring her into the prison instead? Because he's cautious and sceptical and therefore wouldn't go for it (who could blame him, really?) But even smashing his door in while he was out, force-feeding his wife sedatives and dragging her to the jail bound and gagged would make more practical sense.What they do instead, then, is to doorstep him, with Coffey, completely unannounced in the wee hours of the morning. Because obviously he is far more likely to react favourably to a home invasion than a polite suggestion over the water cooler. Mr Cautious emerges with a shotgun in a state of some alarm, as one would in the circumstances. But for all his front he still lets them into the house and up the stairs. Now call me wacky but if several men tipped up in uniform at stupid o'clock with a giant murderer in tow who I didn't have a prayer of stopping by physical means, hell bent on entering my terminally ill wife's bedroom with God knows what in mind, but I had a gun to hand I'd have shot every one of the bastards half a dozen times before they got within arm's length.But anyway. Incidentally, the way that Wetmore is set up as a cartoonish prick so that we are almost forced to applaud when his colleagues turn on him is more than ironic for a film that's supposed to warn us against kneejerk reactions.Watching this film, in fact, reminded me how far we have come since the late 90s. TGM with its crude mixture of political correctness and dewy- eyed sentimentality wouldn't pass muster in this age of withering cynicism. I'm not Spike Lee's biggest fan but his criticism of Coffey's character as the archetypal Magickal Negro was on point.Finally, if anyone actually changed their mind about the death penalty on the strength of a film with about as much grounding in reality as Who Framed Roger Rabbit they need to have their right to vote revoked.Two stars for some very solid performances, one more because my wife liked it, plus 'tilt' because the main man died recently and seemed like the kind of fellow you could set your watch by.

It's an extended flashback wherein a man in a rest home relates his youth as a death row prison guard in 30s Louisiana, and in particular his experience at the hands of John Coffey. Coffey is a colossal black simpleton who's in for the rape and murder of two white girls, but this is Hollywood circa 1999 so obviously he never done it. On the other hand he has a third eye, can project third-person footage of past events directly onto your mind by grabbing your pods, and can cure anything from the clap to inoperable brain tumours to a malfunctioning moral conscience by inhaling the bad from out of your body, then expelling it as a large swarm of insects (?) He can also bring pulverised mice back from the dead. But not two murdered girls, mind you, because they had been dead for 'too long' and that would just be silly.I know Stephen King novels are notoriously hard to adapt, but...With two exceptions, all the major figures in TGM, including, for all we are shown, the condemned men, are Good. They attempt to do the right thing without fail regardless of consequences, or they are endearingly simple, or, as in Black Jesus' case, both. The two exceptions are such laughable caricatures of evil they might as well have the word of curse tattooed across their foreheads; such manichaean nonsense is not the stuff of great films.

There isn't a single wasted shot, scene or line in it, and the two and a half hour running time passed in a thoroughly enjoyable manner. From the opening shots of Pam Grier rushing through the airport to the strains of Across 110th Street, the story unfolds in a gentle but gripping way that allows the characters to breath and become far greater than the sum of their parts.And what a story it is, with Tarantino's vision of the Elmore Leonard novel, Rum Punch, really bringing a vivid life and colour to the intrigue and uncertainty. The performances all work well, with Grier looking as sassy and sexy as any woman I think I've seen on screen, and her counterparts equally stepping up to the plate and delivering. Robert Forster convinces as nice-guy Max, the integrity of the man not overshadowed by his willingness to live on the edges of legality. Jackson and De Niro as the odd bad couple are funny and convincing in their engagements, with the added frisson of Bridget Fonda stirring up the mix.The music is used brilliantly, adding to both the action and the events on screen and seeing it again in a cinema reminds one of just how good the camera work and editing really are. Its sumptuous to look at and quite compelling as you're swept along, particularly a long urgent take in the mall the second time around. I was still seeing things that I had missed in the various times I've watched this on DVD since it's release and I really can't recommend it enough. His best work in my opinion, measured, humorous, thoughtful, well-structured and utterly eminently watchable.
