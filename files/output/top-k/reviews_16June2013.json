I have finished re-watching a big part of my childhood life. Have you ever re-watched a movie from your childhood that you start thinking What was I doing with my life? Well this is how I feel when watching this movie.The plot. As a bunch of random nobodies die on a ship (The one thing to change it from a 1 to a 2 is if Mesa dead could be heard as Jar-Jar falls off the landing platform) and Padme has a few assassination attempts prevented by Anakin and Obi-Wan the plot splits into 2. One is a teen love relationship that looks like the inspiration for Twilight and Obi-Wan tracking an assassin bounty hunter (to cash in on Boba Fett). Once Obi-Wan tracks him to a planet a clone army gets revealed.Now onto the complaints. Half the movie relies solely on Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman's chemistry. They have no chemistry at all, that's the problem. Then there's the fact that the plot is too disjointed to almost make it seem that there isn't a plot. Also the CGI is not only extremely overused but half of it doesn't look real. Then there's the fact that unlike most other bad movies this one is nearly 2½ hours long.This deserves a paragraph on it's own. Yoda's fight with Christopher Lee. It seems to me that all they were doing at the time of writing was trying to have little kids saying Cool!. Why would he need a cane if he can fight like that? Why would he even need to fight when he had the ability in The Empire Strikes Back to lift a spaceship off the ground and land it on solid ground just by raising one hand.So what are the redeeming features? Ewan McGregor. He has more than proved to me through this (It's sad the only other thing I've seen him in is The Impossible) that he can make a bad movie almost worth watching. Christopher Lee does the best with what he's been given, he has good screen presence as a villain but that's it.If you want to watch it go ahead. I've even read other reviews (even positive ones) saying it is the worst of the series so if you like all the other 5 movies then you may have a chance of liking this one.

Dick and when you read his name, you probably just snickered. He might not have had an easy childhood with a name like that and you may not recognize his name, but he is to Science Fiction what Stephen King is to Horror. The films Blade Runner, Total Recall, Screamers, Paycheck, A Scanner Darkly, Next, & The Adjustment Bureau were all based on stories or books that he wrote. Minority Report is yet another of his stories developed for the big screen and one of the most popular. This ingenious film was Directed by Stephen Spielberg and starred Tom Cruise. I am by no means a fan of Tom Cruise, in fact, I've made it a point over the last few years to avoid seeing anything he is in, but this was one film I couldn't miss. To his credit Cruise was very good and exciting throughout, showing a lot of charisma, it was unexpected, but a welcome change from what we normally see from him. This terrific futuristic tale tells the story of pre-crime, a system in which high functioning autistics can predict murders with a very narrow margin of error. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the lead investigator, whose job it is to stop these crimes before they happen. Things are going well for him, that is until his name comes out of the machine and he becomes a target of his own men. The story was deep, yet somewhat complicated, as I was confused at several points in the movie, but that's how you know it's good Science Fiction. The action and chase sequences were fantastic, as was the direction and special effects. The story does however leave some lose ends and I found the precogs to be more than somewhat creepy. It almost seemed like these disabled people were being abused for their unique abilities and not a single character in the film had any issues with that. Minority Report is a long, complex story, but it's fast paced, visually impactful, and will make you think. It only took thirty years, but you can finally add a Tom Cruise film to the list of movies I enjoyed.

I do not approve of the title though, as you cannot mention it in public without being given strange looks.In the end however, it unfolded itself to be quite a nice film about acceptance. Also, the Raspberry awards for worst actor e.t.c were completely unnecessary because they were just trying to find a film to hate that year.

Apologies to the fans. I'm amazed Gregory Peck won the Academy Award. He took what seems like a great part, on paper, and managed to give a stiff, heavy (though convincing) performance, in my opinion. This guy once had a great deal of looseness and charm, as in The Yearling (1946). Is Atticus such a paragon and saint that he has to be played with clenched jaw and stiff neck? I would have liked it if he loosened up occasionally. I just felt Peck was playing one note throughout. I hate to say he was bad, but I felt he was verging on it. I read somewhere that Harper Lee originally wanted Spencer Tracy. Though I suppose Tracy was a bit too old, by then, he had the ability to humanize saintly characters. (Meanwhile, Universal wanted Rock Hudson, their biggest box office star.)The children are natural, but not especially great actors. Alice Ghostly is good, though her ebullience seems toned down to fit in with the Playhouse 90 acting style that pervades everything. Robert Duvall is good. The various supporting players are all commendable but without much presence. They seem to underplay to the point of fading into the background. Maudie, Calpurnia, etc. Then in the courtroom we get some overacting. I can't put my finger on what I don't like about the film, overall, but I just think it's not altogether life-like. I also wish it had been shot on location; I think a lot of atmosphere could have been achieved. The set, which was completely constructed on the Universal back lot by a brilliant art director, Henry Bumstead, is quite an achievement. But no set has the same life to it that a real location has. This isn't a bad film, and of course it has its touching scenes (with several moments greatly enhanced, emotionally, by Elmer Bernstein's score).

I read somewhere that Harper Lee originally wanted Spencer Tracy. Though I suppose Tracy was a bit too old, by then, he had the ability to humanize saintly characters. (Meanwhile, Universal wanted Rock Hudson, their biggest box office star.)The children are natural, but not especially great actors. Alice Ghostly is good, though her ebullience seems toned down to fit in with the Playhouse 90 acting style that pervades everything. Robert Duvall is good. The various supporting players are all commendable but without much presence. They seem to underplay to the point of fading into the background. Maudie, Calpurnia, etc. Then in the courtroom we get some overacting. I can't put my finger on what I don't like about the film, overall, but I just think it's not altogether life-like. I also wish it had been shot on location; I think a lot of atmosphere could have been achieved. The set, which was completely constructed on the Universal back lot by a brilliant art director, Henry Bumstead, is quite an achievement. But no set has the same life to it that a real location has. This isn't a bad film, and of course it has its touching scenes (with several moments greatly enhanced, emotionally, by Elmer Bernstein's score). I just don't have the same reaction to it that many others seem to have.

It was a bad anime after all this effort to make it look like some kind of Hitchcock's movies. Even the crime was very regular. Maybe it's me, I was looking for a kind of Akira or Ghost in the Shell anime. I should read more before downloading. What?
