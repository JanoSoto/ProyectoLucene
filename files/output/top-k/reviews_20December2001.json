Read the book, watched the documentaries and gathered thoughts and opinions from industry types. I was almost ready to write a review before the film even started; all I needed to do was fill in the blanks. I could have talked about the flaws, the highs and the lows of the book, how Middle Earth came to be and why Tolkien only agreed to sell the movie rights to help educate his grandchildren.And so, on opening night, I watched The Fellowship of the Ring. All my preparations were in vein. Sadly, the film just isn't good enough to talk about any problems with the book for the film has many problems of it's own. Peter Jackson's film is certainly an ambitious project, and one that will both amaze and disappoint in equal amounts throughout its 3-hour running time.It is understandable that changes have had to be made to the film, many minor characters from the book have been dropped completely (Tom Bombadil) and some scenes have been cut surprisingly short (The Barrow-downs get about 2 seconds). The first book of The Fellowship, the journey from The Shire to Rivendell is told at breakneck speed. While the book made it clear that it was a long trek, the film made it seem more like a short stroll. Also the characters of Pippin (Eric Idle Jr.) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan), the token comedy duo of the film, are woefully 2D and more irritating than funny. Because of this, the film feels too rushed in its early stages, losing much of the depth of Middle Earth.Peter Jackson and writer Frances Walsh agreeably wanted to make a coherent film while keeping much of the detail of Tolkien's world. Many subplots have been cutout, but strangely their conclusions remain. This means only those who have read the book will the spot any subplot at all and will most likely only pick-up on its shallow representation on film. Perhaps most obvious is the friendship between Sam and the starved pony, Bill. In the book Sam brings the pony back into good health after its poor beginnings in Bree before having to leave it behind when the path was no longer suitable. In the film, a pony appears from nowhere after Rivendell and soon disappears again (at the same point as the book). Sam still appears to be upset, but the audience is given no reason why and no reason to care.To me at least, Fellowship of the Ring seems like the result of an unholy marriage between Tolkien's imagination and Hollywood intervention. In their need to make a coherent film, Jackson and his team have created something that feels more like a string of set pieces in a series of impressive backdrops than the sprawling epic it should be. The need to remind us that Mordor is evil after almost every scene with a quick flyby is irritating and the time wasted here would have been better spent expanding the characters or adding depth to the ground they stand on.But that isn't to say the film is particularly bad. It is, at times, an amazing spectacle, showing off Jackson's talents admirably and the action scenes are occasionally exceptional. The acting too is impressive, with the veterans giving the best performances, especially Sir Ian McKellen's Gandalf in an almost certain Oscar winning roll (whether there are better or not).Perhaps it is because the book is so fresh in my mind, or because my expectations were so high, but this first part of Lord of the Rings is a bitter disappointment. The lack of depth and bastardization of Middle Earth is the films undoing, while the action and the majority of the characters are likeable enough to raise the film above the usual Hollywood yarn. It is hotter than Potter (itself a film with similar problems, but without the imagination) and a film that everyone can enjoy, but I'm left confused when seeing what lofty praise the film has been gaining recently.7\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"20 December 2001","score":"","review":"  So there I was, these last few days, getting myself ready for the new Lord of the Rings film.

The feeling about it depends on where I am coming from, am I watching simply as a cinema goer or as someone who loves the books.As a movie, it is awesome. The acting fails in one place only and that is Galadriel. I felt that Cate Blanchett was stilted and that her character was too dark. She only became decent after she had past the test. For the rest, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood and all the rest excel at their roles. The scenery, the filming and the CGI were all breathtaking. As a movie I feel that this will take at least two Oscars - Original Score and Effects. It may well take Best Film, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Writing - Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.I have no reservations about the quality of this film and Peter Jackson deserves every scrap of praise that he has received.So why my reservations. A torturous analogy I tried after seeing it was that while the book was roast beef with all the trimmings, the movie was only roast beef. It had all the main ingredients of Tolkien's meal, but lacked the trimmings to make it as memorable as the book. Too many of the small details which make the book so absorbing were missing. Yes, I know that to include it all would have made the film too long, but was it necessary to include all the stuff about the creation of the Uruk-hai (not in the book) at the expense of other more important elements of the novel. It also seemed to me that in the film Saruman was simply a servant of Sauron, whereas in the book he had his own agenda.To recap the film was brilliant, it was beautiful, but it failed to capture the essence of the written version. Also, as an afterthought, let me add, it was infinitely better than Bakshi's version.It is not best film of all time, but it is one of the best. It is probably the best fantasy film of all time, taken on it's own merits and the FX are the best to date.What rating would I give this film, I don't know. It depends how I view it, on it's own merits or as an adaptation.On it's own merits 9\/10. As an adaptation 6\/10.

I desperately wanted it to be the best film of all time and was afraid that my expectations were too high. Now I have seen it, my feelings about it are very ambivalent. The feeling about it depends on where I am coming from, am I watching simply as a cinema goer or as someone who loves the books.As a movie, it is awesome. The acting fails in one place only and that is Galadriel. I felt that Cate Blanchett was stilted and that her character was too dark. She only became decent after she had past the test. For the rest, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood and all the rest excel at their roles. The scenery, the filming and the CGI were all breathtaking. As a movie I feel that this will take at least two Oscars - Original Score and Effects. It may well take Best Film, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Writing - Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.I have no reservations about the quality of this film and Peter Jackson deserves every scrap of praise that he has received.So why my reservations.

This is the latest film from excellent director Michael Mann, who is one of the few directors working today who has a unique trademark, and the talent to go with it.   ALI is is a film that will have viewers understand why Ali was such a extradonary boxer and a famous figure.      Cassius Clay who later changed his name to fit his Muslim belief to the now famous Muhammed Ali (Will Smith) was the most popular and best boxing contender in the 1960's and 70's.  He is nicknamed the champ because he would win every boxing match that he competed in.  He is famous for his political beliefs as well as his boxing fights.  Ali was good friends with Muslim activist Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles), Malcolm would be by Ali's side whenever he was in trouble or in financial trouble.  This would lead to the government seeing Ali as a negative figure.  Such a loud mouth man in the 1960's who was African-American (sadly surrogation was still around at the time) and bad mouth the U.S. troops in Vietnam was the target of the U.S. government.   Ali refused to go fight in Vietnam because he has nothing against them Veitcong was what Ali would say.  This would lead to his arrest and his scandal just because he didn't want to fight in a war that he didn't believe in.  Sadly, people today still spite Ali for his belief in the Vietnam War, yet we see political activist like Abby Hoffman as a hero when Hoffman only protested the war and didn't do anything else. The movie spans from the peak of Ali's career, from 1964 to 1974 (which is a wise move, since I don't want to see the tragic Ali-Hollyfield fight when Ali starting suffering from Parkinson's disease).      I watched the excellent documentary WHEN WE WERE KINGS about five years ago and was hooked on the life of Muhammed Ali.  I was curious and entranced by how Ali would say cut downs in rhyme and be so hilarious at the same time.  I was also amazed to see on how such a fantastic fighter Ali was.  Ali would go up against the biggest and scariest looking fighters (Sonny Linston, Smokin Joe Fraizer, etc.) and no be afraid to fight at all.  Ali was the first athlete to be a athlete and entertainer.  Ali would entertain his audience when he was outside the ring with what he would say, and inside the ring by his punches.      I thought ALI was a outstanding film, it does a great job on showing what makes Muhammed Ali one of the most important figures of the 20th century.  Will Smith does a brilliant job playing the champ as he has the attitude and talk just like Ali does.  It shows that when an actor does a lot of homework for the real life person that they are going to be playing, they do such a amazing job that you think it's the real person when you're watching the film (i.e. Jim Carrey in MAN ON THE MOON, Woody Harrelson in PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT).  I am hoping that Smith gets at least a nomination for his role in this film (I would like to see him win, but since Ali is still a controversal figure, it wouldn't surprise me that if Smith gets overlooked).        The other acting in this film, especially by Jon Voight as legendary sportscaster Howard Cosell is top rate.  Mann does his usual skill and casts a wide range of stars to play in his films (like he did in HEAT and THE INSIDER), and with ALI, Mann casts another large cast of talented actors and actresses.  I not only enjoyed Voight, but I also enjoyed Jamie Foxx who played Drew Bundini Brown, who is Ali's friend and co-trainer.  Other acting performances by Ron Sliver, Mario Van Peebles, Jeffrey Wright, Mykelti Williamson, and Will Smith's wife Jand Pinkett Smith all give a great support in the film.     As for Mann's directing, he does a great job as he has done before.  He still can tell a epic story and making it exciting from start to finish.  But unlike telling about a heist, or a whistle blower, this is about the career peak of person, and Mann uses his usual talent again.  The slow-motion movement, the close up shots of the actors, the lighting, and music are the trademarks that Mann has used in his career and shows it again in this film.  I didn't think ALI was as complex and intelligent as THE INSIDER or as brilliant as HEAT, but giving some time like fine wine, ALI will age gracefully to stand on it's own.  And when it does, it will be for one man's viewpoint of the world, instead of several people's view like in INSIDER or HEAT.      I would find ALI to be the most powerful and entertaining film of this year.  Since there are excellent movies being released week after week this month, ALI has stood out above the rest with it's quality of storytelling and style.  I would just hope that ALI would be remembered in Febuary for the Oscars, and maybe Mann might get the Oscar he should have gotten two years ago for INSIDER (yea, I still think Mann did a better job than Sam Mendes!)       ALI is a film that similar to other films in the past tell about a person's life, and their view of the world.  And like the other films, you get a better understanding on why the character acted the way they did (like Larry Flynt and Andy Kaufman).

It's a visually complicated film that definitely takes more than one viewing to completely process, but that's the joy of it - each viewing brings more and more movie joy.  The extra commentaries, dance sequences, interviews with the choreographer and behind the scenes footage definitely help in understanding and enjoying this wonderful, colorful and just plain fun movie.I've never thought Nicole Kidman was anything special, but she is surprisingly AMAZING in this film.  Although the rest of the cast sparkles, Kidman immediately stands out as the true star of this film.  She sings and dances as if she's been doing musicals her whole life, and brings life, charm and wit to a character that could easily become boring and cliched. She plays Satine, a courtesan in 19th century Paris whose one rule is to never fall in love.  Enter Ewan McGregor, who plays a bohemian writer, and all the rules are broken.This storyline has been done a thousand times (everywhere from Pretty Woman to Dangerous Liaisons), but add Kidman's sparkling performance, McGregor's earnesty, and the brilliant medley of pop songs that fuel the film, and you have a hit.Although many reviewers have called the film's use of pre-existing pop songs unoriginal, I think the music is one of its strongest points... what's the point of watching a musical if you can't sing along to it, anyway?

It's a visually complicated film that definitely takes more than one viewing to completely process, but that's the joy of it - each viewing brings more and more movie joy.  The extra commentaries, dance sequences, interviews with the choreographer and behind the scenes footage definitely help in understanding and enjoying this wonderful, colorful and just plain fun movie.I've never thought Nicole Kidman was anything special, but she is surprisingly AMAZING in this film.  Although the rest of the cast sparkles, Kidman immediately stands out as the true star of this film.  She sings and dances as if she's been doing musicals her whole life, and brings life, charm and wit to a character that could easily become boring and cliched. She plays Satine, a courtesan in 19th century Paris whose one rule is to never fall in love.  Enter Ewan McGregor, who plays a bohemian writer, and all the rules are broken.This storyline has been done a thousand times (everywhere from Pretty Woman to Dangerous Liaisons), but add Kidman's sparkling performance, McGregor's earnesty, and the brilliant medley of pop songs that fuel the film, and you have a hit.Although many reviewers have called the film's use of pre-existing pop songs unoriginal, I think the music is one of its strongest points... what's the point of watching a musical if you can't sing along to it, anyway?

The sad thing is that I doubt that I would have noticed, or even cared, about most of the little niggles if I had not read about them beforehand.

I found myself disliking the movie further when you don't find out.Don't waste your time on this one, I saw it free and wished I had watched something else. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"20 December 2001","score":"","review":"  Hi everyone,I have read The Lord Of The Rings trilogy about 10 times so I knew the storyline before I went to see the movie. Purposely I watched very few trailers and TV spots so as to give the movie a fair chance. I was not surprised though with the product of the Director's efforts. I found that the acting the Hobbits did was poor, they seemed sometimes to be wacky just for wacky's sake. The camera angles used to show the height difference between Gandalf and Hobbits was awkward, the cut of the tape was almost visible! I feel bad because the movie had spectacular scenery and stayed true to the book, even in its ending. For 3 hours and $8.00 I was angry about the ending. I knew that the Fellowship was to break up, but for the screen to go blank as it did garnered gasps from the crowd and even a few boos. I can't wait for the next two movies, they will be much more interesting than this first one, it just sets the table. Almost like the dirty tricks played by Star Wars Episode I.
