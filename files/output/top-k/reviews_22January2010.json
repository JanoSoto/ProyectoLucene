Mystery falls somewhere in between those compliments, but transcending hockey is what this movie can hang its skates on. The title says it all. Instead of being called cliche underdog title, or intense sports words it simply refers to the town it takes place in, because that's what's at its heart. Even if the sexual humor is completely awkward and the swearing uncalled for, this movie is about the pride of a small town whose very existence centers around hockey.For one thing, it's worth mentioning that Mystery, Alaska is not based on a true story. Thank goodness. Just because a story is true doesn't make it a great sports movie. Mystery takes all the best elements of an underdog sports story and blends them with this small- town concept by David E. Kelly (Doogie Howser, Allie McBeal and The Practice creator) and Sean O'Byrne.Russell Crowe stars as the veteran anchor of the city hockey team as well as the town sheriff of Mystery, Alaska, where everyone knows everyone and hockey is all that matters. Charlie (Hank Azaria), who grew up in Mystery but flew the nest to be a journalist, writes a piece on the team in Sports Illustrated that captures the interest of the NHL They want the New York Rangers to fly out to Mystery and play the Alaskans. Meanwhile we learn how word spreads in a town like Mystery. One player aptly named Skank is having an affair with the mayor's wife, the youngest player and his girlfriend try becoming sexually active to awkward results and Charlie's presence creates some conflict between John (Crowe) and his wife (Mary McCormack). There's also a lawsuit pending against the sharpshooter of the team because he shot a corporate bigwig in the foot. It's funny but kind of a sad moment when the jury reads the verdict of not guilty with a sly smile and everyone rejoices because without that player, the Mystery team would have surely lost.The small-town politics might be kind of goofy and the random sexual remarks puzzling, but it gives Mystery a soul and keeps it from being dependent on game footage. There's a little bit of game footage early on and then not until the face off with the Rangers. Those scenes become that much more interesting when they don't dominate the film -- a way too common error of most sports movies. Although there is a training montage and a slow clap in this movie, the intention is well and the heart still there.Mystery has some classic moments for a sports film and that's all you can ask for. It might not be the sports epic that Miracle became five years later, but it has that genuinely friendly small-town sensibility making it not only unique, but also less glamorized. It's easy to excuse a film with this much heart of all its quirks and flaws.~Steven CVisit my site http\/\/moviemusereviews.com ","genre":null},{"date":"22 January 2010","score":"","review":" It goes without saying that Mystery, Alaska is all about hockey, but the spin on that is that it's about more than the sport and that's the difference maker between a good and great sports film.

A perfect showcase of M. Night Shymalan's unique storytelling talents.Haters call M. Night Shymalan the one-hit wonder so aggressively that they seem to forget just how effective that one-hit was. His first real big hit (but not his first film), THE SIXTH SENSE is a perfect introduction to the unique and rarely seen (in Hollywood)) storytelling talents of M. Night Shymalan, something that wasn't appreciated for too long. But I doubt anyone will disagree that THE SIXTH SENSE is a triumph of storytelling; a ghost story told in a most original and subtle way and achieves to sustain our interest without much use of heavy effects. But it's actually more than just another well-crafted ghost story, It's also actually an interesting drama grounded in semi-supernatural elements. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a gifted psychologist; his friends and his wife (Olivia Williams) thinks his talents is a gift, but he on the other hand considers it a curse due to a failure to cure a kid in the past that since has haunted him. Meanwhile, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment, a career-making performance) is a quiet, problematic boy. He gets picked on by his bully classmates and his mom (Toni Collette) isn't exactly comfortable when he isn't telling her what's wrong. And you thought seeing dead people was tough! The film says ghost see only what they want to see. So that doesn't make them any less different from the living. Here, Cole sees his ability to see and communicate with folks from the other side as a curse; something he wished he never had. But when he discovers how to wrest control of it, he starts to see what it really is A gift in disguise. This plays a very strong part with the film's still shocking ending (a gimmick Shymalan would use in his later films), but actually plays (among with other issues) throughout the films. THE SIXTH SENSE is more than just a well-crafted genre picture; Shymalan uses it as means to tell a story dealing with some personal issues.Most will remember THE SIXTH SENSE as for its shocker of an ending, a great example of a true and shocking payoff that provides the perfect closure to a perfect film. But the pleasures of THE SIXTH SENSE doesn't begin and end there. The relevant issues tackled throughout the film (more prominently, family issues like divorce, mid-life crises and rejection) is unnerving just as some of the film's jump-from-your-seat moments are subtly creepy. But among the things that truly grabbed me about THE SIXTH SENSE is it's true emotions. Haters can call Shyamalan whatever they want, but he knows a thing or two about emotions. The scene where Cole talks to his mom about how he gets frequent visits from grandma starts out creepy, but really is sad and heartfelt, and Shymalan doesn't make use of any faux emotions whatsoever; just the simplicity of the staging of the scene. Then there's the ending (which I will not reveal for the sake of the small number of people who have not seen it or don't remember it), which was intended to shock the audience. But come to look at it, I realized just how sad and heartbreaking it really is.The setup for his later films would be similar to THE SIXTH SENSE, from the nuanced slow-burn setup paid off by a shocker ending. But like THE SIXTH SENSE, Shymalan's later films have an interesting story told in a most unique way not seen in most typical Hollywood movies.

At times the production design looks like a cheesy neon laser tag set and the special effects are ancient -- especially more than 25 years later. The plot of course is amateur while somehow also confusing. But to love Tron is to look past all that and see the adventurous soul behind this imaginative computer-world fantasy. It's a one-of-a-kind work of imagination that was decades ahead of its time.Tron stars a younger Jeff Bridges as Flynn, a former software program developer who wants to get back at the head of his former company, Ed Dillinger (David Warner), who stole some of his computer game programs and used them to get to the top. To maintain and expand the power of his cyber network, Dillinger created the Master Control Program. That's not too weird, except there's a whole world inside that computer system where programs appear as people or machines. Trying to access the files hidden away that prove Dillinger stole the programs, Flynn is sucked into the computer world by the MCP. Teaming up with his friends' programs, one being Tron, Flynn tries to take down the Master Control Program from the inside.The world of Tron in conceptual terms is what makes this movie so interesting. Not the way it's visually put together, though it kind of has a unique retro high-tech style to it that in some circles might be cool, but the thought process behind it. When Flynn enters the computer, the first thing that happens is he's sent to the game zone where he's forced to compete in games where the loser is deleted. The trademarks of the film such as the flying discs, digital jai alai and the lightcycles come out of these scenes early on. The inventives of these games are what makes Tron good for those apt to like it.Discussing the finer plot points of Tron is to forget it's a wacky Disney movie. There's nothing great about the acting and there's nothing too suspenseful about their adventure either -- it's all about watching what creators Steven Lisberger and Bonnie MacBird come up with next. I do have to mention the very cool aerial shot of the city at night where Lisberger speeds up the tape to make it look like a computer chip. Also, Wendy Carlos' score is a perfect fit for the movie.Then you also have to look at Tron for the achievement that it was in 1982. This movie predates James Cameron movies and he's looked at as the director who is always ahead of his time, working on the cutting edge of technology.

It's a one-of-a-kind work of imagination that was decades ahead of its time.Tron stars a younger Jeff Bridges as Flynn, a former software program developer who wants to get back at the head of his former company, Ed Dillinger (David Warner), who stole some of his computer game programs and used them to get to the top. To maintain and expand the power of his cyber network, Dillinger created the Master Control Program.

The trademarks of the film such as the flying discs, digital jai alai and the lightcycles come out of these scenes early on. The inventives of these games are what makes Tron good for those apt to like it.Discussing the finer plot points of Tron is to forget it's a wacky Disney movie.

I do have to mention the very cool aerial shot of the city at night where Lisberger speeds up the tape to make it look like a computer chip. Also, Wendy Carlos' score is a perfect fit for the movie.Then you also have to look at Tron for the achievement that it was in 1982.

Then it shows a dead man inside a house. Right after it, we see another man going into a church and confessing the murder to a priest. But the plot really begins when the priest is considered the prime suspect of the murder, and he can't tell the police who did it because of the church's principles. The plot itself is already very interesting, ans it's so well-written that doesn't make the viewer bored at all, with great character development and a few clever twists, it's but Alfred Hitchcock's directing makes it even more interesting, with some clever shots at interesting angles, and a film-noir style to it.Montgomery Clift stars here as the priest. Even though he is, in my opinion, a too good-looking priest, and that feels weird, if you can get past that, you can see how powerful is his acting here. Karl Maden also gives a nice acting as the police inspector, but it's Anne Baxter that isn't good. Although her character is important to the story, she feels weird and out of place.This movie also suffers from the same problem as many movies of its time because of the Hayes Code, they were forced to chance the movie's ending from the one featured on the original play in which the movie was based on. If it had stick to the original ending, it would be much better. The other problem I have with this picture is the two major flaws that bothered me. I'm not gonna spoil it here, but anyone can see it, and one of the then is the ending itself.Overral, this is a nice directed Hitchcock film, with a clever plot, but with a weird ending.

No problem there, thats pretty much what all movies do, but Milius' Conan is single minded and lacks a higher moral ethic.Conan is a slayer of men, but not a murderer. He is a man who has a zest for life and ill tempered with those who oppose his passions, and though he has a great amount of presence and unrefined brutal gravitas, he is not thoughtless. He may come across as thoughtless, but he is actually more considerate than schemers in the civilized world. This is Howards' primary thrust with his creation.Conan is not entirely the thoughtless brute with criminal tendencies portrayed in the film. Schwarzenegger's Conan is a single minded warrior of great strength and of single mind. Conan's response to what is best in life is uncharacteristic, and diametrically opposed, of the Conan in Howard's books.Conan of short story lore and comic books wields a sword or axe to kill any and all enemies. But he has a criteria for this when engaging in combat, and does not thoughtlessly dispatch the opposition for the mere sake of it.So, what does all this mean? Well, the Conan of film legend is more of a black idealization of what casual aficionados consider to be Conan. Me, I'm not a fan of Conan, but I find the stories to be well written, even if Howard's views on race and ethnicity don't gybe with me own.Which leads to the next big question about the Conan stories. Is there a racial component, or racist mechanism at work here? Probably, but not in the severe form most people think. Remember, Conan is said to have brown skin, blue eyes and black hair. Apart from the eyes there's not much to identify Conan with so-called white races as he is described to be a rich dark tan brown. Not only that, he is said to be of a race of men who, from all descriptions, would not appear to moved up along the food chain. Kind of ironic, ain't it? Then again, this is what made Howard a great writer; his inner conflicts of what he believed and what he changed his mind about over the years. And, given Conan's description and Howard's own dynamic ethics, it's down right curious why bikers, specifically white North American bikers, take to this character.Conan has a code of conduct, in spite of his gruff manner (a criminal code often times).

There was an opportunity to make money, and they took it.Well, it's not a bad film as such, but had they a better actor, then I think Conan the Barbarian might have been a truly legendary film in terms of not just cult cinema with a huge mainstream following, but honored in the more prestigious realms of filmOh well.

How painful would that be! Thankfully, that bizarre dance-like scene didn't go on any longer than the first couple of minutes (although there was a mercifully brief reprise near the end.) The problem is that even with Keanu's dancing gone, the movie didn't get much better. It's another story about a serial killer (Reeves) playing a cat and mouse game with a cop (James Spader) that he develops something of an obsession with. In this case it's FBI agent Campbell, and in a ridiculous plot point, Campbell is haunted by his inability to catch the serial killer 3 years before in LA. He's now moved to Chicago, he's on disability, he's popping pills, he's suffering severe migraines, he's seeing a psychologist and - from what he tells her - he seems generally unable to function in life. So, of course, with that background and all those problems, when the killer suddenly reappears in Chicago, Campbell is not only asked to help with the case - he's put in charge of it! That makes sense! We spend a significant amount of time watching cops handing out posters with the picture of the killers' next victim on it - because part of his game is sending a picture of who he's going to kill to the cops and giving them a day to try to find her. The dialogue is pretty limited although the performances from Reeves and Spader were OK. There's a bit of a startling revelation when we find out why Campbell is really haunted by the LA murders (and, probably, why he moved to Chicago.)

So here's my broken down review of Shawshank Redemption Plot One star. While the plot flows neatly, is well developed, and doesn't have any loopholes I noticed, it lacks the originality one would expect from the top rated movie on IMDb. I have no complaints other than the lack of providing me with something truly original and complex. It's not a simple plot, per say, just as it's not an unoriginal plot, but it is by no means an extremely original or complex plot.Characters Two stars. No characters went blatantly against psychology, nor did they ever break their characterization. Characterization was pretty good and I have no real complaints, all I would have to question is Andy's character. He was gang raped and got his ass kicked multiple times and was still this calm, cool, collected guy. I don't see how that would work out in the real world, so I didn't find that really believable, but he kept with his characterization and the movie made up for it with the almost relatable nature of Red's character and how well the minor characters were developed. That's probably what blew me away character-wise. No character was exceptionally complex, but all stayed true to their characterization. However, Andy should have been more complex than he was, seeing as how he was the main character.Cinematography Two stars. I have no complaints. Camera angles, effects, etc. were very good, though there was nothing exceptional about them that really stood out to me. Though I do realize that it was pretty well done for a 90's movie. Again, no complaints.Soundtrack Two stars. Again, very well done, no complaints here. At no time did it overshadow dialogue, and at no time were there awkward silences. However, nothing really stood out to me. Not a soundtrack I'd go on raving to my friends about, but no complaints.Acting One star. This is obviously unexpected. I mean, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins...I was surprised I didn't find it amazing. But Morgan Freeman's monologues lacked heart and Tim Robbins' character didn't give him any room for heart to be placed into it. Again, the best acting in the movie, in my opinion, would be from the minor characters. Frank Medrano is worth note, in my opinion, as he was very, very good. But he didn't remain in the movie long, so him and the other minor characters didn't make it enough for me to give acting two stars. I'm sure many people would disagree, though.All in all, I give this movie eight stars and would recommend it to a friend, but I wouldn't have it rated first on IMDb because, while it was very good, it didn't strike me as THAT good. There are more original movies out there that I would recommend before this, though I do recommend that people watch this movie along with the others.

That's probably what blew me away character-wise. No character was exceptionally complex, but all stayed true to their characterization. However, Andy should have been more complex than he was, seeing as how he was the main character.Cinematography Two stars. I have no complaints. Camera angles, effects, etc. were very good, though there was nothing exceptional about them that really stood out to me. Though I do realize that it was pretty well done for a 90's movie. Again, no complaints.Soundtrack Two stars. Again, very well done, no complaints here. At no time did it overshadow dialogue, and at no time were there awkward silences. However, nothing really stood out to me. Not a soundtrack I'd go on raving to my friends about, but no complaints.Acting One star. This is obviously unexpected. I mean, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins...I was surprised I didn't find it amazing. But Morgan Freeman's monologues lacked heart and Tim Robbins' character didn't give him any room for heart to be placed into it. Again, the best acting in the movie, in my opinion, would be from the minor characters. Frank Medrano is worth note, in my opinion, as he was very, very good. But he didn't remain in the movie long, so him and the other minor characters didn't make it enough for me to give acting two stars. I'm sure many people would disagree, though.All in all, I give this movie eight stars and would recommend it to a friend, but I wouldn't have it rated first on IMDb because, while it was very good, it didn't strike me as THAT good. There are more original movies out there that I would recommend before this, though I do recommend that people watch this movie along with the others.

So here's my broken down review of Shawshank Redemption Plot One star. While the plot flows neatly, is well developed, and doesn't have any loopholes I noticed, it lacks the originality one would expect from the top rated movie on IMDb. I have no complaints other than the lack of providing me with something truly original and complex. It's not a simple plot, per say, just as it's not an unoriginal plot, but it is by no means an extremely original or complex plot.Characters Two stars. No characters went blatantly against psychology, nor did they ever break their characterization. Characterization was pretty good and I have no real complaints, all I would have to question is Andy's character. He was gang raped and got his ass kicked multiple times and was still this calm, cool, collected guy.

First of all, I have been to Chicago and there are freeways everywhere! Even after they got off of the freeway they could have found one of many to get out of the bad side of town.A possible goof, when they leave Franks house it is broad daylight then in the next shot with them driving on the highway it is dark. One may think that they had a bit of a drive to get to downtown Chicago, but later Frank says that they are only 10 minutes from home. The fight scene on the highway It's that both, the man and the woman in the truck are saying fu*k you to Ray, but when they began to get out and fight the woman just sat in the truck and simply said leave him alone. Why does she suddenly have a lack of interest in fighting? She barely even looked back. As they are driving through town (before hitting the kid) they pass several well lit streets, they continue down the dark road. After hitting the guy with the RV (even though Ray is a dipstick) they should have listened to him and got the hell out of there, especially when the gang jerks the kids out and starts arguing with him. Instead they keep looking out the back window to see what is going to happen to him. Duhh!! Fast forwarding to the end of the movie (since I don't have time to decipher the entire thing) it was odd when Frank was going into the office of the supermarket (after killing Fallon) and the police officer barges in with gun drawn and tells him to freeze. Frank tells him that his friend and brother are upstairs bleeding to death, and the cop stands his ground. All of the sudden another officer who wasn't even in the room and couldn't have possibly heard Frank, comes in and says it's alright, he's telling the truth! Then all of the sudden the first officer lowers his gun and they go running out of the office. Come on, I am a Cincinnati Police Officer and there would be more to it than that!! Remember, don't break any of Fallon's stupid Rules! Anyways, aside from the oddities mentioned, I loved the movie and found it to be very entertaining.

Like heroine, the user immediately feels pleasure once the substance is introduced to the bloodstream, the user is raised high into a state of euphoria. In the first half hour, the movie is mellow and pleasurable to watch, but not without its cringes. After a while, the effects start to dwindle.

It seems one of my earliest memories was hearing an older boy say he was Batman, which I think happened when I was just under three years old, the year this movie came out. Since it's a PG-13 rated movie, it would obviously be a long time before I would be old enough to see it, but I was more than old enough by the time I first watched it in late 2005. That was when I first saw all the modern Batman movies that had been made so far by that time. Right now, I've seen this first installment in the franchise a total of four times, and it hasn't worn thin with several viewings!Gotham City is a corrupt, dangerous community with a high crime rate, but a mysterious man in a bat suit, known as Batman, is known to appear and fight criminals! The city's residents don't know who this man is, but he is Bruce Wayne, a rich man whose parents were murdered in his presence when he was a child! He lives in a mansion called Wayne Manor, and the only one he can consider family now is his butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Jack Napier works for Gotham City crime boss Carl Grissom, and is sent to raid a chemical factory one night. This is a set-up by the boss, and after the police arrive, a shoot-out begins! Batman gets involved in the fight, and eventually drops Jack into a vat of chemicals! The criminal survives, but is disfigured from the chemicals, and becomes the Joker, a clown-like lunatic who kills Grissom and then threatens the city with deadly hygiene products! Batman must try and stop The Joker's evil ways, but the people in the city don't necessarily realize that Batman is on the good side! A lot of things help this comic book movie work, and one of them is some of the performances. Michael Keaton is good in the starring role of Bruce Wayne\/Batman, and so are Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale, Michael Gough as Alfred, etc., but the most notable performance is that of Jack Nicholson as Jack Napier\/the Joker, especially after the character becomes the Joker! This main villain here, one of Batman's famous enemies from the comic books, provides a lot of the humour in this film, and I think Nicholson's talent has a lot to do with this. This successful 1989 blockbuster also features lots of action and suspense, as one would expect, and this really helps keep it entertaining for so much of its approximately two-hour run! I can't forget to mention the visuals, which are dark and absolutely stunning! Since the movie was directed by Tim Burton, this is not surprising. On the downside, there's occasionally some fairly weak dialogue in this film, especially between Bruce Wayne and Vicki Vale, and the Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl) character's quips are generally not funny like they're apparently supposed to be, but fortunately, the positives outweigh the negatives by a LONG shot! It has now been more than twenty years since this movie's hugely successful box office run, and it's clearly still popular today, even after the massive success of Christopher Nolan's two Batman films, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, and I would say it deserves to be. After Tim Burton directed the first two installments (this and Batman Returns), Joel Schumacher took over for Batman Forever and Batman & Robin and sadly polluted the franchise. The series wasn't redeemed until Nolan rebooted it in 2005. However, this 1989 film can still be remembered as a great start for the franchise. As a PG-13 rated film, it's obviously not appropriate for little kids, even though Batman has usually been known to be kid-friendly. This comic book adaptation is very dark and intense, and there's also some swearing and mild crudeness, but if you're old enough to watch it and you generally like superhero movies, I highly recommend this one!

Michael Keaton is good in the starring role of Bruce Wayne\/Batman, and so are Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale, Michael Gough as Alfred, etc., but the most notable performance is that of Jack Nicholson as Jack Napier\/the Joker, especially after the character becomes the Joker! This main villain here, one of Batman's famous enemies from the comic books, provides a lot of the humour in this film, and I think Nicholson's talent has a lot to do with this. This successful 1989 blockbuster also features lots of action and suspense, as one would expect, and this really helps keep it entertaining for so much of its approximately two-hour run! I can't forget to mention the visuals, which are dark and absolutely stunning! Since the movie was directed by Tim Burton, this is not surprising. On the downside, there's occasionally some fairly weak dialogue in this film, especially between Bruce Wayne and Vicki Vale, and the Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl) character's quips are generally not funny like they're apparently supposed to be, but fortunately, the positives outweigh the negatives by a LONG shot! It has now been more than twenty years since this movie's hugely successful box office run, and it's clearly still popular today, even after the massive success of Christopher Nolan's two Batman films, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, and I would say it deserves to be. After Tim Burton directed the first two installments (this and Batman Returns), Joel Schumacher took over for Batman Forever and Batman & Robin and sadly polluted the franchise. The series wasn't redeemed until Nolan rebooted it in 2005. However, this 1989 film can still be remembered as a great start for the franchise. As a PG-13 rated film, it's obviously not appropriate for little kids, even though Batman has usually been known to be kid-friendly. This comic book adaptation is very dark and intense, and there's also some swearing and mild crudeness, but if you're old enough to watch it and you generally like superhero movies, I highly recommend this one!
