Soon he is joined by other people, strangers, who also have no idea where they are. Looking around they find that each room leads to another one that looks just the same. One of the group is the famous prison escape artist Rennes, who realises that some of the rooms are booby-trapped but that he thinks he has got the solution. With no other ideas the group follow him and try to evade the traps and stay alive &#150; all the time with absolutely no idea of why they are here or who has imprisoned them.I heard about this film years ago but only recently managed to find it on television to watch. It is hard to think that it is almost a decade old now but that it is still effective and a regular cult movie that people will still talk about. Its power is in its simplicity &#150; every room is the same and every next room could be safe or could be a trap; there is no reason for any of it and there appears to be no way out. Usually this sort of stuff makes for a great pitch but not always a good movie because the idea can't stretch beyond a catchy gimmick, however here it does it and makes it look easy. The whole film is our characters trying to work their way through the rooms without getting horribly killed. This in itself is gripping and at times unbearable to watch &#150; horror fans may be disappointed that long periods go by without a lot of gore but personally I prefer tension to the delivery.At the same time we also get the characters feeding the mystery of the cube, building the tension and the sense of hopelessness without ever really solving anything. It answers questions with more questions and keeps things moving well. The development of the characters is better than I expected and I liked the way that the film played with the characters, changing them as the film went along. It isn't a fantastic character piece but again it is just something that helps keep the film moving and I suppose it was interesting to see the nature of people come out. In that regard I was also impressed by the cast. I had expected poor performances from a low budget film but actually they were all quite good. Wint is best but towards the end his performance became a bit too simplistic. Hewlett underplays and probably has the least character to deal with but is still good. De Boer was effective and interesting. Robson was a nice distraction. Guadagni was a good counterweight for Wint and played well to develop him and herself at the same time. Miller was good and the pace of the film helped distract from him basically doing a Rain Man impression.Overall an impressive low budget thriller that works because it sticks to the simple idea while building side issues with the characters and the cube around it but never actually solving anything. Perhaps it is better not to over praise it because I thought it was at its best because I didn't know what was going to happen.

Lots of blood, sex with movie-star-hot men or women, big explosions, exit wounds? Lots of that in your everyday life, I assume? And yes, a lot of fantastic, unrealistic things happen in this film, which may also pose a problem for you if your sense of wonder is limited to things like who is going to win the next Survivor. Yet all of these fantastic unrealistic things are all directly related to the concepts of heroism and villainy.This entire movie is about heroes and villains, right down to the cab driver. It is not about how Billy Zane looks in purple spandex, or how hot the female leads are, or how much you hate Treat Williams' over-the-top performance, or how you think it rips off Indiana Jones (funny, I'm pretty sure Jones was a nod, in part, to the Phantom!). If these are your only reactions after watching this movie then you have indeed wasted your time. Fortunately, time like yours isn't very valuable when you would probably rather waste it spending days playing the next version of Grand Theft Auto.The Phantom revisits the concept of heroes. I'm not talking about people like Vin Diesel, Pamela Anderson, 50 Cent, or this year's American Idol. Heroes are people who have character, integrity, morality, and courage; people who stand for, and stand up for, what is right. With so little of this in the world around us today, I guess it's not surprising that so many people have a problem with the concept. These days the hero is the person who can kill the most opponents (I can't call them bad guys here), screw over the most people, get the most toys, or have sex with the hottest hotties. Basically, we now equate heroism with personal gain and success.The Phantom, like all true heroes, does what he does because it is the right thing to do, not because he stands to gain from it. He is capable of performing selfless acts that can make a difference for the better, and on top of that, he does so anonymously! How often do you see that in today's society? Drax is a villain because he is the villain, not because we see him slaughtering innocents or committing some other purely evil crime. We don't need to see Singh's band blow up a ship full of people with body parts flying in slow motion to understand they are also villains. It might require a bit of imagination, which also seems to be in short supply these days, but the idea is that they are as bad as you can imagine them to be. Once again that sense of wonder has to come into play.

It is fun for all ages; the six kids that sat in front of me at the theatre had a blast, and my mother likes it too.

My suggestion is that you see the movie for a couple of times, focusing on little details. Personally it took me three times to restructure my own interpretation. I am afraid I will not suggest you to read the book because first of all I believe the movie and the book should be considered separately. I don't think you need to read the book to interpret the movie, that is of course if you are not stuck in things like murders that we face during the movie. American Psycho takes more than that, it is a pure criticism. I have to warn you that the following sentences will be representing my own interpretation of the movie. American Psycho is a true work of art and the person we recognize as Patrick Bateman is simply not a character in the common sense. He is the human version of a life style, so we do not witness Patrick Bateman's story, what we see in the film is the criticism of American Wallstreet top life. He may be considered as a symbol but not as a simple human being. To those who still argue if the murders are real or not; yep they may be real. But then how does he get away it? Well, the characteristics of his construction gives him the freedom to change, a life style is not something static. Reconsider the scene in which he shoots the company guard. Just some seconds later we see the scene again but only this time Bateman pulls out a pen instead of the gun from his pocket. This is I believe evidence enough for the characters unusual nature. Observe Bateman's colleagues. Observe them as Bateman states inside, inside is not important. See how they behave. You will find a lot of clues that suggest Patrick is something formed from his circle of friends. After all Bateman may not even be there in flesh, he is an idea of something, something so empty inside but still trying to look convincing.

He is the human version of a life style, so we do not witness Patrick Bateman's story, what we see in the film is the criticism of American Wallstreet top life. He may be considered as a symbol but not as a simple human being. To those who still argue if the murders are real or not; yep they may be real. But then how does he get away it? Well, the characteristics of his construction gives him the freedom to change, a life style is not something static. Reconsider the scene in which he shoots the company guard. Just some seconds later we see the scene again but only this time Bateman pulls out a pen instead of the gun from his pocket. This is I believe evidence enough for the characters unusual nature. Observe Bateman's colleagues. Observe them as Bateman states inside, inside is not important. See how they behave. You will find a lot of clues that suggest Patrick is something formed from his circle of friends. After all Bateman may not even be there in flesh, he is an idea of something, something so empty inside but still trying to look convincing.

My suggestion is that you see the movie for a couple of times, focusing on little details. Personally it took me three times to restructure my own interpretation. I am afraid I will not suggest you to read the book because first of all I believe the movie and the book should be considered separately. I don't think you need to read the book to interpret the movie, that is of course if you are not stuck in things like murders that we face during the movie.

Perhaps its because of the humor, the action and battle sequences, or the great new characters introduced in the movie, or the fact that everything ties up brilliantly at the ending, or maybe its due to the bright atmosphere of Endor. The real reason is possibly a combination of all those elements, plus some more.Star Wars Episode VI - Return of the Jedi is a breathtaking action packed and fast paced science-fiction adventure movie. The movie never has a slow or dull moment. Still it also knows how to emote at the right moments. This is necessary because the story of the movie is quite emotional on its own. It's about the redemption of Darth Vader, the temptation of Luke to the Dark Side and about the downfall of the Empire and the Emperor. This are some heavy subjects which are told brilliantly and without ever making the movie go over-the-top.Still perhaps the biggest power of the movie are in its character. The three main heroes, Luke, Leia and Han all get their stuff to do again for the last time. Their characters are so incredibly strong, well written and portrayed by its actors, that all of them have become classics over the years. And not just they, many characters from the Star Wars universe has grown into well known movie characters. I think this says something about the brilliance of the whole Star Wars saga and how it is written and brought to the screen with lots of passion and talent involved, behind and in front of the camera. This movie also introduces some new well known characters, such as Jabba The Hutt, The Emperor (OK he also was in Star Wars Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back but this time he is fully correctly introduced and used in the movie.), the Ewoks and many more memorable characters.Out of all the Star Wars movie this one is quite possibly the most spectacular, even though Star Wars Episode II - Attack of the Clones comes close. It has many action sequences and the end battle is memorable as well as impressive. It's a three way-battle, where we have Han, Leia, Chewie, 3PO, R2 and the Ewoks fighting the Imperial troops on the forest moon of Endor, we have the Rebel Alliance in space battling the Empire and the Death Star II and we have Luke fighting on the Death Star II against Darth Vader. All three battles are just as important and are given just as many screen time. It makes the final battle sequences something unforgettable and totally awesome to watch. Especially the space battle is without doubt the most spectacular, tense and adrenaline pumping space battle out of movie history. Yes, even after Star Wars Episode III - Revenge of the Sith.The special effects for especially the battle sequences look better as ever before. But it are not just the spaceships that are made to look great. Also the sail barge, the Rancor, the battle for Endor with its AT-ST's..it all looks incredibly spectacular and convincing. So are the costumes and make-up. We get to see some crazy looking but oh so cool new characters this time.The whole totally imaginative world, characters and weapons is conceived brilliantly in the movie.

His character, Harry Lyme, supposedly dead, is hiding in a dark doorway. His American friend, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), who came to Vienna to see Lyme and instead has gotten wrapped up in trying to solve the mystery of his death, is looking toward the doorway at the figure in shadow. Suddenly, someone in an upstairs apartment across the way turns their light on, which shines directly on Harry's face, revealing him to his friend. The look Welles gives at that moment was singlehandedly deserving of an Academy Award. With just a faint smirk on his lips, a twinkle in his eye, and not one single word of dialogue, he manages to say hello to his friend, apologize for lying to him, and invite Holly in on what Harry seems to think is a great big joke. When people talk about those classic moments in films, they're talking about moments like this.The Third Man is like a Graham Greene novel come to life, and not surprisingly, since Greene wrote the screenplay. But it catches the tone of a Greene novel in a way no adaptation of any of his stories has ever been able to do. Many people will call The Third Man a film noir, but it's not really. It's got noirish elements, but underneath the seriousness of the storyline, there's a tremendous sense of fun that is unique to Greene's style of storytelling. He's out primarily to entertain you, but if he makes you think a little bit along the way, that's o.k. too.The atmosphere of post-WWII Vienna is brought to vivid life with lots of location shooting amid bombed out buildings and rubble. This movie has some of the best black and white cinematography ever, shown to best advantage in the breathless race through the sewers at the film's climax. And of course, there's that glorious zither theme that recurs throughout the movie, which adds much to the funhouse tone of the film.The performances are flawless. Welles is great as mentioned. Cotten has almost never been better. Trevor Howard is urbane and witty and Wilfrid Hyde-White (you'll know him as Pickering in the film version of My Fair Lady) is a hoot as a dotty Englishman (when he finds out that Holly came to Vienna to meet a friend who has shown up dead, his response is I say, that's rather awkward.) Only Alida Valli disappoints. She's a vapid actress who delivers everything in a boring monotone, but in this case her acting style fits the character she's playing so well that it doesn't hurt the film.A fantastic film that I can watch again and again.

When people talk about those classic moments in films, they're talking about moments like this.The Third Man is like a Graham Greene novel come to life, and not surprisingly, since Greene wrote the screenplay. But it catches the tone of a Greene novel in a way no adaptation of any of his stories has ever been able to do. Many people will call The Third Man a film noir, but it's not really. It's got noirish elements, but underneath the seriousness of the storyline, there's a tremendous sense of fun that is unique to Greene's style of storytelling. He's out primarily to entertain you, but if he makes you think a little bit along the way, that's o.k. too.The atmosphere of post-WWII Vienna is brought to vivid life with lots of location shooting amid bombed out buildings and rubble. This movie has some of the best black and white cinematography ever, shown to best advantage in the breathless race through the sewers at the film's climax. And of course, there's that glorious zither theme that recurs throughout the movie, which adds much to the funhouse tone of the film.The performances are flawless. Welles is great as mentioned. Cotten has almost never been better. Trevor Howard is urbane and witty and Wilfrid Hyde-White (you'll know him as Pickering in the film version of My Fair Lady) is a hoot as a dotty Englishman (when he finds out that Holly came to Vienna to meet a friend who has shown up dead, his response is I say, that's rather awkward.) Only Alida Valli disappoints. She's a vapid actress who delivers everything in a boring monotone, but in this case her acting style fits the character she's playing so well that it doesn't hurt the film.A fantastic film that I can watch again and again.

His character, Harry Lyme, supposedly dead, is hiding in a dark doorway. His American friend, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), who came to Vienna to see Lyme and instead has gotten wrapped up in trying to solve the mystery of his death, is looking toward the doorway at the figure in shadow. Suddenly, someone in an upstairs apartment across the way turns their light on, which shines directly on Harry's face, revealing him to his friend.

A rich businessman who practically lives in his office, has the biggest apartment in the most expensive building, closes million dollar deals for breakfast and beds lingerie models as often as he can. He has it all but a simple good deed done late on Christmas Eve to stop a black man robbing a convenience store sees his life change dramatically. He wakes up the next morning in bed with the girlfriend he left 15 years ago to pursue his career. His kids break into the room with the dog, excited about Christmas and all Jack can think is this is not my beautiful woman. He heads back to his old apartment but nobody knows him and the only person that acknowledges him as Jack Campbell is Cash, the guy he dealt with the night before. Cash tells him that he is on his own and has to work out what he has to learn from this glimmer of a different life.In the first bit of this movie I was actually quite enjoying myself as we build up Jack's high power life and then see it pulled from under his feet. However as we move away from this moment, the film gradually slumps down into a family over money piece of mush that cannot even convince itself of what it is saying. Jack's fall and his upper class revulsion at the life and the wardrobe of the lower-middle classes is quite funny but the film can't spend too long on this or else it risks the audience laughing at the cheap things that we are eventually going to be asked to embrace in favour of money and career. The film then provides semi fish out of water amusement as Jack struggles to fit into his life but really we're heading straight for a sentimental life lesson. In this regard it is so syrupy that I was worried that I would develop diabetes as a result of spending two hours with it. The conclusion is as cloying as you fear it will be and, giving that it doesn't have the lack of money as a worry, more or less makes a nonsense of the family or money theme by letting our characters get away with money and a shot at happiness &#150; which is fine but why did it go so anti-career for so long.The cast try hard to lift it into something touching and engaging but they can't manage it. Cage does well early on but he struggles to stay afloat in the mush. He knows what he is supposed to do but the nature and situation of his character damages his performance &#150; for example he occasionally has a really good chemistry with Leoni but mostly he can't because in the story he is supposed to fear this life and not know her. Leoni is better because she fits into this world; she is not a great actress but she was always good in this sort of light fare and I quite liked her domestic role. Cheadle is given rubbish to work with and produces rubbish; I hope he got well paid for adding his name and reputation to this film because he got nothing out of it other than that. Piven, Rubinek, Presnell and a few others add faces and names to the film but they are all minor characters.Overall this is a sentimental mushy film that, although a little entertaining and distracting, is really only ever going one place. When it gets there, it delivers a corny and unconvincing finale and bails out on the option that would have had the biggest emotional impact and been fair to the audience (Jack grimly accepts his glimmer and his loss but moves on with his current life but as a changed man) because the studio believe that only the happiest possible ending will do. They (and their test audiences) were wrong because it is cloying and sickly and it creates a black hole that sucks the hour leading up to it slowly but surely into the mushy mire with it.

Let me list them 1) The number two person in the conspiracy to nuke Fort Knox changes sides and betrays her comrades...because Bond slept with her? Gimme a break. Judging from her personality, she'd be about the last person in the world I'd expect to do such a thing. It's obvious that the writers couldn't think of any way of getting out of the corner they'd written themselves into, so they tossed in a deus ex machina cop-out ending.2) Bond just doesn't do much of anything in this movie. He spends the last half of the movie sitting in a cell while other characters run around and do things that don't advance the plot one bit. It's boring. I appreciate the fact that he uses his brains to get out of trouble, but he never really gets out of trouble, he just turns a bad situation into a slightly less bad one. This is about the only Bond movie where he's so ineffectual, and it makes for a very unentertaining film.3) Bond allows himself to be captured by the bad guys so that he can go and check on the condition of a woman who got hit with a flying hat? He barely knew her! He gave her a ride to a gas station; that's it. It makes no sense that he'd jeopardize his mission in order to check on the condition of a stranger. What was he going to do, give her CPR? He certainly didn't want to be captured as part of any sort of plan, as he spent the next ten minutes of the movie trying to get away again.4) Why didn't Goldfinger just kill Bond? He hit the nail right on the head when he said that Bond only knew the name of the operation (blockbuster), but he didn't know any of the details. Then Bond tells him that if he is killed, they'll send another agent. Well, obviously. Goldfinger certainly must have assumed as much. But how would anyone even know if Bond was killed? It was just another poorly thought out scene.5) Pussy Galore is a really unlikable character. Not only is she just plain homely, but she brags and brags and brags about herself.6) The ending on the plane felt very tacked on and silly. Are we to believe that a woman and a fat guy overpowered all the soldiers in a military aircraft hanger and stole a plane right out from under their noses?Oh, there are a few good things about the movie. The Swiss Alps are beautiful, even in Summer. The car is really cool. And of course the theme song is fantastic.Overall, this is easily the worst Connery Bond film. Much worse than any Roger Moore or Timothy Dalton or George Lazenby Bond movie. I can't for the life of me understand why people hold it in such high esteem, the writing is just so ridiculously sloppy. I enjoy most of Connery's other Bond films, but this thing sticks out like a big, stinky sore thumb.

But, remarkably, the film doesn't seem dated. This classic tale of ambition and manipulation features characters real enough that you can imagine the same story happening today. Scheming Eve Harrington insinuates herself into the life, and eventually the career, of aging actress Margo Channing. A vivid array of theatre types either help or hinder Eve as she rises to fame; they include Margo's younger boyfriend\/director Bill, famous playwright Lloyd and his wife Karen, Margo's sharp-tongued maid, and influential critic Addison DeWitt. The characters are well-drawn, with many foibles; nearly everyone behaves stupidly or cruelly at least once.The screenplay for All About Eve was based on a short story, and at times the film feels too literary or talky or stagy. Scenes tend to be long, as they are in stage plays, rather than short, as is usual in the movies. The camera work is fluid and competent, the lighting is bright and professional, but they lack that cinematic spark. Still, though, it's hard to say exactly how to change the screenplay&#151;it's full of witty observations about life and the theatre, which would be a shame to lose.Bette Davis deserves all the praise she gets for this role, and the movie loses a lot when she's not in it (especially toward the end). I was struck by how she conveys Margo's larger-than- life personality, the actress who can't stop performing, while also showing us Margo's real human needs. George Sanders is excellent as Addison DeWitt (was there ever a more perfectly named character?), gradually revealing the slime beneath his cultured persona. Thelma Ritter and Marilyn Monroe are great fun.The character of Bill is supposed to be 32 years old, prompting 40-year-old Margo to fret about how she's losing her looks and dating a younger man. Gary Merrill acts the role of Bill well enough, but he looks at least as old as Bette Davis, making this plot line somewhat unbelievable. Celeste Holm and Hugh Marlowe, playing Karen and Lloyd, are unremarkable. And I still can't decide how I feel about Anne Baxter's performance in the major role of the manipulative Eve.Though All About Eve has its flaws (I'll admit it, I prefer Sunset Boulevard), it's a smart movie, with an excellent script and some wonderful performances.

But, remarkably, the film doesn't seem dated. This classic tale of ambition and manipulation features characters real enough that you can imagine the same story happening today. Scheming Eve Harrington insinuates herself into the life, and eventually the career, of aging actress Margo Channing. A vivid array of theatre types either help or hinder Eve as she rises to fame; they include Margo's younger boyfriend\/director Bill, famous playwright Lloyd and his wife Karen, Margo's sharp-tongued maid, and influential critic Addison DeWitt. The characters are well-drawn, with many foibles; nearly everyone behaves stupidly or cruelly at least once.The screenplay for All About Eve was based on a short story, and at times the film feels too literary or talky or stagy. Scenes tend to be long, as they are in stage plays, rather than short, as is usual in the movies. The camera work is fluid and competent, the lighting is bright and professional, but they lack that cinematic spark. Still, though, it's hard to say exactly how to change the screenplay&#151;it's full of witty observations about life and the theatre, which would be a shame to lose.Bette Davis deserves all the praise she gets for this role, and the movie loses a lot when she's not in it (especially toward the end). I was struck by how she conveys Margo's larger-than- life personality, the actress who can't stop performing, while also showing us Margo's real human needs. George Sanders is excellent as Addison DeWitt (was there ever a more perfectly named character?), gradually revealing the slime beneath his cultured persona. Thelma Ritter and Marilyn Monroe are great fun.The character of Bill is supposed to be 32 years old, prompting 40-year-old Margo to fret about how she's losing her looks and dating a younger man. Gary Merrill acts the role of Bill well enough, but he looks at least as old as Bette Davis, making this plot line somewhat unbelievable. Celeste Holm and Hugh Marlowe, playing Karen and Lloyd, are unremarkable. And I still can't decide how I feel about Anne Baxter's performance in the major role of the manipulative Eve.Though All About Eve has its flaws (I'll admit it, I prefer Sunset Boulevard), it's a smart movie, with an excellent script and some wonderful performances.

If it wasn't hardly any of the business of the nation would ever get done. Even a boy ranger has to do that every now and then. Compromise is not a word heard in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Frank Capra's heroes and villains are starkly contrasted in his populist films. This film with its powerful performance by James Stewart as Jefferson Smith, interim appointee to the United States Senate from an unnamed western state, is now such a part of Americana that criticism of it is almost sacrilegious. The performance is great, but the premise behind the film needs some examination.Having a national boy's camp seems like a fine idea, who could be against it. But having it be at Willett Creek in his state, was that truly necessary? Granted that the proposed dam is piece of pork barrel legislation that a few are going to make a killing on. Quite realistically the dam is a rider on an appropriations bill that Capra names the deficiency bill which is a bill for further relief to the citizens of 1939 USA which was still in the Depression. Stewart is by his filibuster, holding up relief for a whole nation. Here's where compromise comes in. The seasoned politician or even a novice trying to learn would ask himself, just what are my priorities? Isn't getting that boy's camp my goal, how do I achieve that goal? In the end Stewart might get that boy's camp, but I certainly hope if he did stay in the Senate he didn't develop any other goals that halted the nation's business.Give and take, that's what it's all about folks.Jean Arthur is a fine Capra heroine. Women in Capra films can certainly be independent and have careers, but their main function is to support the hero, especially when he's down. Her best moments in this film and in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town is when the hero seems beaten and all is lost, she provides the spark that gets him up before the bell counts him out.Capra rounds the cast out with a whole crew of familiar players who you look to as old friends whenever you see one of his films. One of Capra's great attributes was an intuitive sense of casting, just like John Ford. Whenever you see Edward Arnold, Guy Kibbee, Thomas Mitchell, you know immediately the kind of part they will be playing and you welcome them as old friends.Claude Rains plays the other Senator from Stewart's state, a well respected man who's being talked of for the White House. It's Rains's only Capra film and as always he gives a great performance. He's the mouthpiece of Edward Arnold's political machine in the Senate and has been there a few terms. He's also an old friend of Stewart's late father. It's only an appeal to Rains by Stewart on a personal basis that breaks things open during that famous filibuster scene. Capra had to have that in the story because other than that, Stewart would have been dealt with by his colleagues summarily despite his last stand heroics.Ego is something that has to be put aside occasionally.

Set between 1977 and 1983, the film portrays the pornographic film industry in California at its peak, and its imminent downfall, invoked by the introduction of the video tape - something that reduced the creative ambition of the porn filmmakers to a simple push-button recording and introduced competition from anonymous amateurs to the business.It appears that the people involved in the industry (actors, producers, directors, technicians) all lived in a sort of a ghetto (flashy and glossy nonetheless); had they ever dared to part from it, they would have had inevitably gotten burned - either by the stigma that had been cast on them, or in the face of the fact that their abilities in the real world were never held at a high price, which is what lured them into the industry in the first place. It is obvious, then, that inside this little world, these people have found a haven where they could appear important, a universe which was built upon and sustained through all sorts of hedonistic temptations and dubious financial sources.

It is obvious, then, that inside this little world, these people have found a haven where they could appear important, a universe which was built upon and sustained through all sorts of hedonistic temptations and dubious financial sources. It was a cocaine-fed lie, and they knew it.Boogie Nights describes the paradigm shift of the sex cinema industry in a similar manner in which Gone with the Wind approached the abolition of slavery as an eclipse of the civilization of the South. One of the film's features is that it loosely depicts real-life characters and situations, like the film's Dirk Diggler (Wahlberg's character) posing for John Holmes in real life. This is what makes characters of the film all the more believable; they are ignorant, shallow, terrified and self-indulgent. The soundtrack of the film is impressively appropriate.Certain scenes definitely make cinema history, like the one in Alfred Molina's character's apartment, where an unexplained Chinese character, probably in an opium-induced frenzy, explodes fire-crackers every half a minute or so. The story-telling in scenes such as this one hits the mark in expressing the state of the characters' minds. The film is simply brilliant. ","genre":"Drama"}]
