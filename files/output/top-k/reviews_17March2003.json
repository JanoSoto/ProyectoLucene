Everything is well in place for the real story to begin a drifter named Calhoun (Robert Carlyle) wanders into this remote location.  Half-dead, he tells a tale not unlike the real happenings of the Donner Party and the Jayhawkers (which occurred about the same time as the film is set).  A tale of murder and cannibalism that provokes the occupants of Ft. Spencer on a journey to find the truth...I'm not going to write much more about the plot here.  The story, by Ted Griffen who uses the Windigo myth as a starting point, is only one element of this fine film.  Antonia Bird, the director of RAVENOUS, and her cinematographer, Anthony B.

Bird (who arrived on the project at the last minute) deftly executes a very nuanced story and never allows the events to become overly silly.  Much credit must go to Bryce Perrin, who designed and coordinated the look of the sets.  Ft. Spencer comes to life with a distinct presence and style, traditional, yet slightly gothic.  The setting and tone are helped greatly by the score, by Damon Albarn & Michael Nyman, which is just strange enough to work in this film; from piano loops to twangy getaway music, the score matches the macabre visuals perfectly.  The cast is great, especially Carlyle, who seems to relish his scenes of over-the-top mayhem.Memorable moments abound in RAVENOUS.

In every human life there comes a period of inner change and self-discovery. For some it is in the form of a coming of age experience. For others it delves deep into the wild recesses of the mortal mind unto returning with something you can never have. For David this event comes in a plural. WE open the film with the accidental drowning of a young David's twin sister that, whether his fault or not, he blames himself for. This eats at his conscience and bears burden in his dreams until it forms into a nightmare. That occurrence happened in England in the year 1909. Now we take another trip to America during the `roaring' twenties.' David has become a famous psychologist who devotes his life to exposing supernatural `frauds.' He is then given a rude awakening when he is called back to his English stomping grounds by an elderly lady who claims that she is haunted by spirits within the walls of her estate. Along with the lady, resides her three grandchildren. Everything inside the manner is draped in white cloths like it had been abandoned for years and David soon finds out belief is a scarce commodity is this residence but the truth is only a kiss away. A love story then blossoms when David finds himself being drawn to the hunting beauty of Christina. Christina's brothers don't take kindly to this as the ring of mystery unfolds before our infallible eyes. Not since the death of Hitchcock has a film been so beautiful in its terror and so mysterious in its atmosphere. Director Lewis Gilbert has created an eye catching period piece that is so twisted in nature it morphs itself into a state of normalcy. But this is not a ghost story at heart nor is it some one off love story. This is a look into the mind of a man who desires to find redemption in his suffering and to break free of the guilt that walls him in and limits him in expression. Because he feels guilty for the death of his sister, David's scope on reality is limited. That is until he meets Christina. He instantly falls in love with her, hiding his feeling of guilt because he feels no need to let them collide with the burning desire he has for her. And only through her can he understand the meaning of true love in the end of the film, the end of life and the end of time. The film ends with a climatic plot twist that has become rather standard in method with films of this nature. The thing about this one though is that given close enough inspection the mystery of the twist is put into serious jeopardy within the first fifteen minutes. Yet it is this twist in shape, form and spiritual mentality that leads up to all the opinions that are presented in the film, making this a very hard work to talk about without giving too much away. Even through surprise endings the climax here is weak. It becomes too much of a horror film cliche and forgets its roots as a sensual tale of supernatural feelings. The thing that saved the end from total meltdown was the very touching wrap-up, which in fact, had the most to say about the entire film as compared to the other scenes presented beforehand. If you were reading carefully you would have noted that I said that the roots of this film involve `supernatural feelings.' Supernatural means the unexplainable. It is something that is caused bye the power above the forces of nature. This film is not strictly about ghosts or haunting, only through those things can it speak to use about how the feelings in life that we need to cleanse our souls of regret are above anything that we classify as natural, vision quests are a good example of this. Even better from a film point of view are David Lynch Films. But this is not dark and disturbing like Lynch films nor is it weird in any sense of the word, rather it is warm and inviting. Everyone is greeted with a smile as the sun beats down on the beautiful green grass. Gilbert provides you with a welcoming environment. A place you could call home, where everyone is happy and free of burden. This is the perfect place for our characters to plant their seeds and let their emotions blossom into something beyond nature. Because of this we are allowed to feel for these characters. There is no bloodshed in this film and there are no real scares either, all attempts at horror are either false alarms or unexplained bumps in the night. That means that this is strictly character driven fare that relies that relies just as much on atmosphere to advance the emotion as the actors themselves. Aidan Quinn plays David and does a great job in brining out the tortured soul in himself and the non-believer who just possibly wishes that he could believe. The other main asset in the acting department is Kate Beckinsale as Christina. She plays her character with a certain free willed flair that a young teenage on the path of self discovery would have, but also possesses a look in her eyes of a child who knows that has something inside that needs to be told but doesn't wish to tell. The chemistry between the two main leads have such a strong bond that they are sensual enough to be erotic yet passionate enough too not become gratuitous. Also the direction is beautiful in such a manner that it is subtle in its touching moment and rapid in its chills. This is not to say that the film doesn't travel its road to success without fault. The worst offence it commits is that it doesn't really take off until a half an hour in, and if you are anything like me you will have it figured out by then. Another small glitch that I found was that Quinn eludes an English accent that his child character had at the start of the film (I guess he must have grown out of it). Once you get past those small set backs you will more than likely take it upon yourself to enjoy this film. IT isn't something that can be forced upon you; it just works its way mysteriously into your system and arouses those deep dark secrets in you that have been burning at the back of your neck for ages like a ghost's howl in the wind.

This film's austere ending is a commentary on the prevalence of heartless evil in our society.  Reduced to its simplest expression, there is no joy in nature.  Make no mistake, this is an ugly film that you will only want to see once.  I cannot imagine anyone finding the same degree of stark satisfaction from the sanitized 1993 American version, complete with a happy ending tacked on to appease nervous producers.  Please don't see the 1993 version.Rex and Saskia are two young lovers on holiday, alternately loving and fighting as close couples are wont to do.  Their flaws are revealed, making them more endearing  during the drive he becomes macho and demanding, while she rebels and becomes petty and shrill.  After the fight, they are closer than ever.  One cares about these characters, can imagine their lives together for years to come, possibly even getting married.  She's earthy and fun-loving, while he is quietly appreciative of her company.  Oddly, she presages the forthcoming events by recounting a strange dream about a golden egg.  These two seem a perfect match.  The sun sets on their short romance when they stop at a rest area and she disappears.  He hangs around the rest area for hours, long into the night looking for her and trying to reconstruct her footsteps through the rest area.  The sense of desperation and mystery lingers, and it shows in his pained expression.  Anyone who has ever lost a loved one can identify with his quiet, desperate longing.Several years later, Rex is still obsessed with Saskia's disappearance. His romantic partner, realizing that she can never take Saskia's place, walks out on him.  Rex appears on talk shows, canvasses neighborhoods with flyers, and revisits their favorite places in an attempt to understand just why Saskia disappeared.  This part is important  Rex wants to understand the nature of evil, and in order to successfully get through this film without lying awake all night with the ending forever running in your head, it's important to acknowledge this aspect of his character.The film cuts to Raymond, the man who kidnaped Saskia  you might have imagined a raving maniac, but instead you see a gentle, kindly older teacher with a wife and son, living in a well-appointed flat and driving a Citroen; he might just as well be Pere Noel on summer holiday.  This film is constructed like a crime scene investigation.  First we experience the disappearance firsthand, and then we go into the mind and life of Raymond, showing how he coldly planned and carried out the kidnapping with as much emotion as changing the oil in his car.  It is this two-part process which slowly builds the powerful suspense in this film.  We see how methodical he is in his approach to the planned kidnaping, and, impossibly, we even laugh at him  looking for a victim, he inadvertently makes a pass at a young woman he knows, and she calls him on it, saying that he should be ashamed of himself.  It is this twist of fate that drives him to kidnap a young woman from the rest area, where no one is likely to know him.  So the fates have brought him Saskia.Aware of Rex's obsession, Raymond offers to meet him in a public place and show him what happened to Saskia.  Suffice it to say that the mystery of Saskia's disappearance is frighteningly revealed at last; listen closely and you can almost hear God laughing in the soundtrack.  Because of the strong ending, I would recommend seeing this film with at least one other person.There is nothing beautiful about this film; it is cold, ugly, and unfair. At the very least, maybe it will help you to understand the unreasonable nature of evil.

Suffice it to say that the mystery of Saskia's disappearance is frighteningly revealed at last; listen closely and you can almost hear God laughing in the soundtrack.

This film's austere ending is a commentary on the prevalence of heartless evil in our society.  Reduced to its simplest expression, there is no joy in nature.  Make no mistake, this is an ugly film that you will only want to see once.  I cannot imagine anyone finding the same degree of stark satisfaction from the sanitized 1993 American version, complete with a happy ending tacked on to appease nervous producers.  Please don't see the 1993 version.Rex and Saskia are two young lovers on holiday, alternately loving and fighting as close couples are wont to do.  Their flaws are revealed, making them more endearing  during the drive he becomes macho and demanding, while she rebels and becomes petty and shrill.  After the fight, they are closer than ever.  One cares about these characters, can imagine their lives together for years to come, possibly even getting married.  She's earthy and fun-loving, while he is quietly appreciative of her company.  Oddly, she presages the forthcoming events by recounting a strange dream about a golden egg.  These two seem a perfect match.  The sun sets on their short romance when they stop at a rest area and she disappears.  He hangs around the rest area for hours, long into the night looking for her and trying to reconstruct her footsteps through the rest area.  The sense of desperation and mystery lingers, and it shows in his pained expression.  Anyone who has ever lost a loved one can identify with his quiet, desperate longing.Several years later, Rex is still obsessed with Saskia's disappearance. His romantic partner, realizing that she can never take Saskia's place, walks out on him.

I will see any movie. I can look at films as art and as interesting ways of killing two hours. A successful movie is one that I can remember long after I leave the theater, which for me is a huge stretch because my short-term memory has been killed by all the fast-paced editing we see everywhere today. To put it simply, after seeing Goldmember the only thing I remembered from that whole movie was the very beginning with the mock opening. And this was just as I got to the parking lot. I had heard only briefly of Koyaanisqatsi after seeing posters for Naqoyqatsi, the final part of the trilogy. Hearing all the hoopla about the first film being revolutionary and exciting, I went and got it. I took it home, saved myself an hour and a half of nothing to do and put it on. Someone had told me that this movie's praise in the early 80s came from the fact that no one had ever been exposed to shots like the ones in the film before. There were no long-form time lapse shots, no IMAX-like landscape views, no shots of random people staring at you for five minutes, and that alone is revolutionary. Indeed you are left to draw your own conclusions after you finish watching everything and that in itself is a dangerous idea. The cinematography is beautiful. Yes, you could find a lot of these shots on inspirational posters, but inspirational posters don't compare city grids to motherboards or the minor bustle of Grand Central Station during rush hour to the quiet stillness of nature. And finally, Koyaanisqatsi has no poorly-written one-liners. The DVD cover is enough to have photography majors in my school giggle with joy. The score for this movie, done by Philip Glass, is incredible. It can be said that it's aural poetry when combined with the images the music is put to. Glass, himself, said on the DVD that he would write music to fit exactly what he saw, and it's crystal clear what he going for in most senses. When there was a bustling crowd or a rushing flood of weiner dogs, Glass would be there to compliment the frenetic pace. It beats Madonna's Ray of Light video to the punch. Unfortunately what mostly gives this movie its downfall at this day and age is how outdated it is for its message. The music, though minimalist (barely) and symphonic, is electronic in parts and can sound like your average B-rated educational video. And look at the hair on those women. It must be the 80s. As a time capsule, this film works beautifully to ressurect images locked in our minds from that era of the late 70s, early 80s, but for us in the new century, the concept of the film spouting Life without Balance can be lost quite quickly. Being new to the films I couldn't help but hold my breath every minute as shot after shot revealed the basis of what would be parody after parody after parody in later years. Who knew Vessels by Philip Glass was what was being parodied by South Park, or how many times have we seen time lapse shots of cars on a freeway in terrible educational videos? So many things seem to have come from this movie it is astounding. If you've heard about this movie and have just a slight interest in seeing it, give yourself the time and patience to give it a shot. Not much will seem new to you, but if you let the engaging visuals and Glass' impressive score enter your senses, you'll find yourself entranced all the way to the credits.

Not that television's cheesiness is obvious to everyone. If it were, half the shows now being aired would disappear. SOMEBODY is buying it. So maybe Paddy Chayefsky's sendup is justified.He does a pretty good job of it too. This is consistently amusing and keeps your attention. One of the reasons is that the performances are uniformly good, believable characters in what is actually an unbelievable plot. The supporting roles are as well done as the principals. Robert Duvall has lately lapsed into a kind of effortless groove, but here he brings energy to the job. And Ned Beatty is superb ushering Peter Finch, the mad broadcaster, into a spookily lit, deserted boardroom, launching into a top-of-the-voice Old Testament speech that amounts to the message, Money makes the world go round. Halfway through this tirade he abrupty stops booming at Finch, pauses, and asks quietly, Am I getting through to you? In a way, the performers are better than the roles they're asked to occupy, mostly one-dimensional stereotypes.The script itself is witty but overwritten. People don't talk that way. But that's not really much of a problem. They didn't talk that way in All About Eve either but it was still neatly done. One certainly can't argue with the underlying premise of the movie either. I think the title of Neil Postman's book on the subject is, Entertaining Ourselves to Death. The problem is that people, as easily led as they are, are simply not forceful enough to throw open their windows and shout into the streets because some nut tells them to. The script makes a familiar error in equating anger with the life force, and quiet compliance as a form of chicken****. But I guess I get Chayefsky's point -- at least if you're screaming with rage you are still alive. I wish the rage that he admires so much had some sort of direction. In this movie, it doesn't. Dozens of causes for anger are described or alluded to the Russians of course, the Arabs, crime in the streets, a sense of powerless, ontological Angst, the cog in the wheel feeling, rude doormen, unemployment, recession AND inflation, and crippling hangnails. The resentment is spread so thin that it covers none of the many potential targets. Not that the enemies aren't identified in the dialogue. Diane, Holden tells Faye Dunaway, you're television incarnate, which the average viewer has already grasped a long time ago. But then the dialogue carries an overload of intensifiers, as if Chayefsky wants to pound it into us not only that the characters mean what they say, but they REALLY MEAN IT. After watching a disheartening TV program, Duvall is compelled to slap his knees, get to his feet and say this A disaster. The program was a disaster. An unmitigated disaster. The death knell. Later he describes his boss's attitude as inflexible. You say his attitude is inflexible? another character asks. Inflexible -- intractable -- and adamantine, Duvall replies. In other words, pretty firm. Duval moans that yesterday he was the network's Sun God . . . the golden boy. . . the heir apparent. (He rephrases in units of three.) This wasn't too bothersome because it actually comes across as amusing. One imagines Chayefsky stringing those three gorgeous gems together and clapping his hands with glee. He must have had a good time writing this, scoring all those points. For some reason I seem to enjoy his earlier work more, when he dealt with the little people. A fat, ugly Italian butcher finds a wimpy shy girl and falls in love with her, deciding to pursue her over the objections of his family and friends, and we are moved. We know how the lovers feel; we know what heartbreak is. Or a middle-aged man falls for a beautiful young woman and deals with the problem of time. We can identify with these little people who have ordinary but genuine problems. But who do we identify with in Chayefsky's later work, after he tackled big problems? The suicidal doctor? The grasping, greedy, insane, and murderous characters of Network?Chayefsky was an interesting guy, a huge, good-humored Victor Hugo of a writer. He worked in an office near that of Bob Fosse, above the Carnegie Deli in New York. Daily at noon he would show up at Fosse's door and bellow, Fosse -- let's EAT. They'd spend hours chatting at their table in the deli, Chayefsky munching his pastrami on rye with mustard and pickle, Fosse chewing his pastrami on white bread with mayonnaise.

So maybe Paddy Chayefsky's sendup is justified.He does a pretty good job of it too. This is consistently amusing and keeps your attention. One of the reasons is that the performances are uniformly good, believable characters in what is actually an unbelievable plot. The supporting roles are as well done as the principals. Robert Duvall has lately lapsed into a kind of effortless groove, but here he brings energy to the job. And Ned Beatty is superb ushering Peter Finch, the mad broadcaster, into a spookily lit, deserted boardroom, launching into a top-of-the-voice Old Testament speech that amounts to the message, Money makes the world go round. Halfway through this tirade he abrupty stops booming at Finch, pauses, and asks quietly, Am I getting through to you? In a way, the performers are better than the roles they're asked to occupy, mostly one-dimensional stereotypes.The script itself is witty but overwritten. People don't talk that way. But that's not really much of a problem. They didn't talk that way in All About Eve either but it was still neatly done. One certainly can't argue with the underlying premise of the movie either. I think the title of Neil Postman's book on the subject is, Entertaining Ourselves to Death. The problem is that people, as easily led as they are, are simply not forceful enough to throw open their windows and shout into the streets because some nut tells them to. The script makes a familiar error in equating anger with the life force, and quiet compliance as a form of chicken****. But I guess I get Chayefsky's point -- at least if you're screaming with rage you are still alive. I wish the rage that he admires so much had some sort of direction. In this movie, it doesn't. Dozens of causes for anger are described or alluded to the Russians of course, the Arabs, crime in the streets, a sense of powerless, ontological Angst, the cog in the wheel feeling, rude doormen, unemployment, recession AND inflation, and crippling hangnails. The resentment is spread so thin that it covers none of the many potential targets. Not that the enemies aren't identified in the dialogue. Diane, Holden tells Faye Dunaway, you're television incarnate, which the average viewer has already grasped a long time ago. But then the dialogue carries an overload of intensifiers, as if Chayefsky wants to pound it into us not only that the characters mean what they say, but they REALLY MEAN IT. After watching a disheartening TV program, Duvall is compelled to slap his knees, get to his feet and say this A disaster. The program was a disaster. An unmitigated disaster. The death knell. Later he describes his boss's attitude as inflexible. You say his attitude is inflexible? another character asks. Inflexible -- intractable -- and adamantine, Duvall replies. In other words, pretty firm. Duval moans that yesterday he was the network's Sun God . . . the golden boy. . . the heir apparent. (He rephrases in units of three.) This wasn't too bothersome because it actually comes across as amusing. One imagines Chayefsky stringing those three gorgeous gems together and clapping his hands with glee. He must have had a good time writing this, scoring all those points. For some reason I seem to enjoy his earlier work more, when he dealt with the little people. A fat, ugly Italian butcher finds a wimpy shy girl and falls in love with her, deciding to pursue her over the objections of his family and friends, and we are moved. We know how the lovers feel; we know what heartbreak is. Or a middle-aged man falls for a beautiful young woman and deals with the problem of time. We can identify with these little people who have ordinary but genuine problems. But who do we identify with in Chayefsky's later work, after he tackled big problems? The suicidal doctor? The grasping, greedy, insane, and murderous characters of Network?Chayefsky was an interesting guy, a huge, good-humored Victor Hugo of a writer. He worked in an office near that of Bob Fosse, above the Carnegie Deli in New York. Daily at noon he would show up at Fosse's door and bellow, Fosse -- let's EAT. They'd spend hours chatting at their table in the deli, Chayefsky munching his pastrami on rye with mustard and pickle, Fosse chewing his pastrami on white bread with mayonnaise. He picked up his nickname, Paddy, from some early association with the Irish. He never made it into old age. I'd love to have been in that deli with him.
