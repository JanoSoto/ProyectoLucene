Kay Chandler, a republican congresswoman finds out her husband was on the plane. Sgt. Van Den Broeck, a policeman who's name is so foreign his colleagues call him 'Dutch', discovers his wife Peyton died sitting next to Mr. Chandler, travelling as his wife. The grief of losing his beautiful, loving wife is combined with the dent to his ego from being made a cuckold, posthumously.Obsessed with finding out what drove his wife to infidelity, he tracks down the congresswoman, and seduces her. But their affair is disturbed by the jealous memory of the dead lovers, of the lie that all four had been living before the crash. The byline reads In a perfect world they never would have met. In a perfect world filmmakers would think twice before embarking on adaptations of bad 80s novels, especially when they lack irony. This adaptation has the emotional realism and grittiness common to the NY film scene, but it is weighed down by too much plot, too many chapters and too much character which has to be condensed into 131 minutes. The result is an acceleration of narrative events that makes the relationship between Dutch and Kay improbably intense and unstable.The ground covered by the film means its 131 minutes felt like three hours to the audience, who began laughing at all the wrong things, even groaning in disbelief as the chapters rolled on. But many of them were there because they'd been given free passes, and were seeking entertainment, not an extended exploration of a grief-stricken relationship. The film has some interesting elements, such as the class conflict between Kay, who got elected to Congress because her dad was famous, and Dutch, the paranoid internal affairs policeman who can't believe his wife got bored and fell for a toff who paid for regular first class trips to their Miami lovenest. There is an unusually raw, honest quality to the script, which has some tense exchanges full of wit and wounding unsophistication, but which is also padded out with inane smalltalk. The film relies too heavily on words to entertain its audience, and the only available subplot is Dutch's run-in with a corrupt cop, which proves so distractingly stupid and violent it cripples the entire movie, combining the high concept of the cop drama and airplane disaster, with the interior drama of two confused lovers. There was a palpable draining of interest from the cinema after Dutch and Kay's repressed sexuality erupts in a violent grope-session in the airport carpark. It seems letting a middle-aged couple engage in teenage sex is taking cinema one base too far for Australia's multiplex audiences. From then on, the audience's primary interest seemed to be What time is it?Random Hearts suffers for its complex 'adult' concept - it fails to generate the appropriate audience expectations. It strives for a truthfulness that endangers its place on the romantic comedy shelf, and it attempts an intrusive action-based subplot that confuses the audience by stripping the film of any romance it had. Whilst it makes some bold political and moral statements, overall the film is a weak adaptation that lacks emotional integrity and popular characters. Pollack has honourable intentions, but the best he can do is go down swinging. His movie will translate better on the smallscreen when viewers can walk away from the parts they don't like to make some coffee, relieve themselves, even engage in some nooky themselves, before coming back to catch up with the plot. It's a mixed-up movie about a mixed-up world that should have been serialised and syndicated for the entertainment of bored housewives; not developed into a serious screenplay with multiplexes in mind.

First, and most obviously, is the holiday-gone-bad aspect.  The rest I realized as I watched this film immediately after Halloween.  The film starts in the past, just as Halloween does.  Second, the presumed killer in Prom Night is hounded by a cop, just as Halloween's Meyers is hounded by his psychiatrist.  Third, the killer escapes from an asylum and drives a distinctive, stolen vehicle.  Four the killer has been catatonic since the original incident and five, his car is seen in the background of a couple of scenes.  This film is different, however, as it does not want you to assume the escaped lunatic is the killer, and instead gives you about 15 choices.  This guess the killer is pretty well done, and doesn't resort to its psuedo-remakes trick of throwing an entirely new suspect in at the last moment. The rest of the film, aside from this one novelety is rather boring.  The whole set-up lacks suspense and direction.  The whole affair feels like a late 70's movie-of-the-week.  The film was obviously shot in Canada and suffers from a very 70s Canadian horror film look and feel.  All of the characters are quickly glossed over and stereotyped, probably due to the aforementioned gimmick of everyone-a-suspect which requires a lot of time.  The film doesn't really get going until the last half hour, and then killing after killing is fit into the film. Unfortunately, its not even all that so-bad-its-funny; its mostly just mediocre.  There are a few scenes that will amuse the whole Saturday Night Fever sequence; the fact that the Prom, and indeed the whole film has only one disco song in it, played over and over; the final murder sequence which is difficult to believe as its background is the aformentioned disco song; and the fact that half of these high school students look to be at least 28.  To be honest, I felt the orginal trailers included on the end of the tape I rented were better than the entire film.

I must say his villain was not as good as he could have been, I think if you give him some authority, he has a more powerful and important character, but they still did a good job of making him the main enemy here.

However, this is a movie written by the author of Scream, and I had all problems with it that I also have with horror movies I was at the same time bored by the lack of interesting scenes and excited in an uncomfortable way because of the danger, i.e. at the same time I wanted to fall asleep and where totally nervous.And all the time my mind was constantly reporting all these typical faults of horror movies they talk too much, and far too intimately, with the teacher, as if it would be their friend and not their enemy, they behave often like sheeps in dangerous situations, and they run into danger as if they had not been warned before. If a fighter in a war would behave that stupid, he would run around singing loudly while he knows enemies are around him, with no ammunition in his weapons and far away from any cover. How surprising that he dies or get caught !!!Katie Holmes had real problems with her role, she had to be an intelligent girl which is skilled in writing and a stupid girl, which doesn't know what irony means, and a girl which is the best pupil of a school and a stupid girl, which sleeps with some boy for completely idiotic reasons, all at the same time ! That simply doesn't work. The acting of the other people in this movie where good, however.And the manipulations of the teacher on the pupils are so laughable. For the plural is simply wrong she only manipulates them all into one way. The way she did it was a little nifty, but it was completely obvious for the watcher. So better watch The Negotiator with Samuel L. Jackson if you want to see really excellent psychological manipulations.The end of the movie, however, was really good, it appeared suddenly and was very surprising and funny. There is also another really amusing scene where the lover of the teacher enters the house. The only problem was its unlikeliness; for example, the man hugs a boy in the dark and doesn't notice that this is not his beloved. Everyone knows women have the softer skin and some really soft organs in front of their hearts which men don't have ! So this was funny, but not at all realistic.In the sum, I've to state that I didn't liked this movie, which really was a disappointment because I thought it must be very good.

I'm glad this film pissed people off - it proves it was stupidly honest, stupidly nostalgic, stupidly big-hearted and not cynical, clever, PC nor anti-PC, not a mockery of anything. It's an American film by a British director, and like Lolita, boils thick Americanisms down to crystals of statement, taste, elan. How could anyone walk out on the fat man yodelling as the camera dollied in to that tight close-up?! It was a gem of a shot, a little gauche perhaps, not unlike the marlboro country the film rolls through, and the naked desire for the days when men were MEN - with winning hands, whiskey shooters and a tasty redhead named Mona... But this isn't leering masculinity bristling with three day growth! There is a notable absense of guns (for a western), and when they appear they are not sharp and shiny but heavy, tarnished and chunky. This is MC Solaar's nouveau western - cutting up slow shy grins, dusty scuffles, mewling coyotes and a lugubrious soundtrack heavy with sentimental strings, trumpets and the convenient pause for punctuation. This is true Hollywood, and I mean that as a compliment. It was one of those rare occasions where suddenly you see the film as more style than substance. That's why it was showing in Darlinghurst and not the multiplexes! Because of Woody Harrelson - so stupidly generous, stupidly the big man with his big scruples and big square jaw - it is a film that could so easily slip by, scoffed at, discounted for wearing its heart upon its sleeve, pinned not far below the stars and stripes and the silver star for service to country, mateship as tight as knuckles, horses with bottom and all that glory.It's a movie for Kerouac, he loved this kind of carousing and childishness. Here, life is Hi and the cattle lo, plain Lo, yet another adopted child of Scorsese and his deep deep pockets. From the depths of my reputation I bring you... How dare he! Kidnapping the history of American film, like he was god's gift to world cinema, doing it all as a public service. But its worth it for Billy Crudup with his old man's shoulders, Billy with his switchblade, Steve with his necktie, straight six and coronary, LB and Bigboy - it all comes down to Bigboy - the backbone of the film, the gut-feeling and laboured gasp of this weighty piece of cinema.It's old-school treatment, all sinew and gristle, bloody hooves; pretty dresses, buddy bottles and mexican girls who visit fortune-telling witches. It's a film which doesn't teach America's children to express their anger with words not weapons. No, like Apache tank-killers and cruise missles flattening Serbian houses, it tells Americans to go hard or go home - take it square on the chin, tear those clothes off and take whatever gratification you can get whilst still being the best man, the best friend, a good man with a natural feel for horses. It's homestyle American apple pie, all fragrance and warm pressure, like a horse nibbling oats out of the palm of your hand. So rope em and rape em cause nothing's keeping a good man down cept for a bullet in the chest or a pair of wide open thighs... And while I bluster, it's all poetry in the Hi-lo country, with its bloated cattle and californian dreams, snow on the ranges and the good ol' boys, we're just telling it like it is...Further notes.

And then, through death and betrayal, they were brought together into a relationship of mutual need.  It said a  lot about the way in which shared pain can unite even the most improbable partners - and yet this seems to have passed most reviewers by.  The reality of this incongruity, the different way in which it was appreciated by Kay and Dutch in the closing moments of the film was a perceptive insight into differences in male and female psyches.I think you needed to be in mid-life or later to really appreciate this film - and for many in that age group, the theme could have been quite threatening - so as a box office hit it is likely to miss out with both the young and many in their 40s.The sloppy camera work (mike booms appearing on at least 2 occasions) was technically the worst thing about it.As for Kay's accent - well I'm an orstraylian and it seemed near enough to the real thing for me!

I had the privilege of watching this movie as an assignment for a class. When I mentioned privilege, I really meant it.  Those days when I was in Law School it was a real treat! Our Professor\/Judge gave us that as a class assignment for Professional Responsibility\/Legal Ethics.  I can tell you something! Between watching this movie and  reading a one hundred and fifty page assignment for a class, I take this movie anytime!  It sticks with you, like the plague,  to see in what troubles an attorney can get into by getting involved,  especially emotionally involved,  with a client.  Well the fact that I had free time due to the lack of mandatory reading for a class in itself,  made me biased in favor of the movie. The Professor had the class spot the ethical rules that were broken in the movie such as never get involved with a client. Well Teddy Barnes, Glenn Close( The Natural) did just that. I am not going to teach the legal issues in this movie to you.  But I respectfully disagree with Leonard Maltin. I think that the characters are very believable, specially if you are in law school and you are hanging in there by a thin tread of fear thinking what I am going to do if I have to defend a man like that?  This movie was reality to me. It sure was!  Just image one of the members of the defense team falling in love with O.G. Simpson.  That is where this movie goes. It can be watched in multi-level fashion. I watched it about twelve years ago and watched again on television last week. It scared me to death both times.  It is a very powerful movie! Actually the story without the romance has a similar fact pattern to the Simpson case. Coming to think of it, it is like life imitating art!   I recommend it, especially for the legal beagles.

Her last one, Strike, is still my absolute favorite of 1999 (but for americans, its a movie of 1998).Unlike almost any other movie, this one isn't filmed using an absolute standpoint, but is designed as if it's a real documentation of a camera team, plus some material filmed by other camera teams, and by the police. I liked this style very much, it added magic and realism to the movie, including the fact that the camera people became actors when they interviewed the actors or talked with another camera team, and the actors, if they recognize the camera, interact with it.It's basic story is about a beauty competition where some girls are too ambitious and use every weapon they could get, including murder. This sounded boring in my ears, I only watched the movie because of the stars (I simply trust people which made good movies in the past), and was of course very happy about that afterwards, because, as I already stated, this is an absolute masterpiece, with perfect acting, one wonderful scene after the other, full of black humor, full of parodies about the typical craziness of americans (for example, their love to weapons), full of especially crazy americans and last not least - prepare to watch the ugliest, most abnormal, kinkiest, most one-dimensional Denise Richards you're ever seen, and also the most intelligent, most gorgeous angel called Kirsten Dunst you can imagine. Or even can't. In complete harmony with their roles. Whow ! That's art, that's acting ! During the later movie, you would take any oath that Miss Dunst is the most beautiful woman of the world, even if you're not one of those people which would swear that at any time (I wouldn't).If you hated movies such as There's something about Mary or The opposite of sex, don't watch this one.
