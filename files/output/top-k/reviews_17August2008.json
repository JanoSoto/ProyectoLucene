Personally, I thought Halloween 5 was a better film. It had more action, better pacing, and still lived up to it's franchise. The latter point was also done by H4 as well, but the film just wasn't as enjoyable to me. Halloween 5 may have been panned by many, And I get it. But frankly, I thought it was enjoyable.Halloween 4 and 5 go together well, just like the first two Halloween films did. They're actually meant to, if you watch the end of H4. Provided, you have to suspend disbelief to accept how Halloween 5 continues. However, it all falls within the realm of Michael Myers' character, so it's not as if you'll necessarily be smacking yourself in the head over it. However, it really could have been done better. The obvious solution would have been the best one.That aside, this movie is just FUN. That's what it does best. From start to finish, I wholeheartedly enjoyed it. It established a solid body count, without delving in to Jason Voorhees levels of absurdity. I didn't feel like it needed to drop itself on to a lower level. Michael Myers still maintains the class that he always had. But the film evolved to suit the time in which it was released.The ESP part of the film (which I have the feeling that a lot of fans didn't like) didn't bother me in the least. I thought it was an acceptable twist, as it didn't mutilate Michael Myers's persona. Myers has to evolve in order for the franchise to remain interesting. I found this to be an acceptable part of his evolution. The main thing that made him who he was remained intact. We're given a GLIMPSE of possibly humanization by the man, but that is gone just as soon as it appears. Happily re-affirming to fans of the series that despite these developments, he's still Michael Myers.Danielle Harris puts up another outstanding performance in this film, as she did Halloween 4. Donald Pleasance, as we know, is always gold. Provided, they may be the only exceptional characters in the film, but it's not bogged down by the rest of the cast.I only had one problem with Halloween 5. The ending. I especially hated it because it set up Halloween 6 perfectly. And THAT movie is absolutely wretched. You want to talk about RUINING the character through a bad choice of character development, that movie takes it. Anyway, let's get back to H5. The whole man in black storyline was really the only reason that this movie ever SHOULD have been panned by Halloween enthusiasts. Truth be told, if I didn't know what it was setting up for (the aforementioned atrocity), I probably wouldn't have even hated it that much. Regardless, it was a sub-plot that I could have done without, that set up for a sequel that I DEFINITELY could have done without.Overall, I thought this was a damn fun movie. It has it's bad points, sure. But to me, the rest of the film was so enjoyable that I didn't dwell on them too much. Give it a shot.

Personally, I thought Halloween 5 was a better film. It had more action, better pacing, and still lived up to it's franchise. The latter point was also done by H4 as well, but the film just wasn't as enjoyable to me. Halloween 5 may have been panned by many, And I get it. But frankly, I thought it was enjoyable.Halloween 4 and 5 go together well, just like the first two Halloween films did. They're actually meant to, if you watch the end of H4. Provided, you have to suspend disbelief to accept how Halloween 5 continues. However, it all falls within the realm of Michael Myers' character, so it's not as if you'll necessarily be smacking yourself in the head over it. However, it really could have been done better. The obvious solution would have been the best one.That aside, this movie is just FUN. That's what it does best. From start to finish, I wholeheartedly enjoyed it. It established a solid body count, without delving in to Jason Voorhees levels of absurdity. I didn't feel like it needed to drop itself on to a lower level.

However a group of terrorists crash the party with a new agenda and John McClane undertakes a lone fight inside and out of the building as both the terrorists and the Cops seem determined to kill him.This is another one in a series of films I have critiqued that shares a distinction of being one of the best films of the eighties. The characters in this movie are well fleshed out and you believe in the depictions of all of them. John as the world-weary, Bogart-esquire cop with a great line in pithy comebacks, but also great utterly cheesed off dialogue as well, Bonnie Bedalia as the wife in question has little to do but does it well, however in this movie it is Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber who is most memorable in creating a performance of a chilling bad guy, motivated solely by greed and with a plan so fiendish that you just don't spot the twist coming.The action sequence and the tension cranked up by John McTiernan's superb direction is magnificent and you never feel settled as you watch, always nervously worried whether McClane is gonna make it out of there in one piece and the key scene with the glass is one of the most cringe making in movie history. The use of music, in particular Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is also terrific as it is used as both a rousing piece as undercurrent for certain scenes and joyous celebrations for others.However, one of the most interesting things about this movie is the way that it has spawned a falsely assessed movie formula. For most lazy critics they seem to think that a hero against the odds equals Die Hard on ...something e.g Under Siege equals Die Hard on a boat, Speed equals Die Hard on a Bus and also Executive Decision equals Die Hard on a plane. All of these assessments however are incorrect as they forget the key thing that makes Die Hard the one off that it is, and that is that in all these films just mentioned the authorities are on the side of the hero, whereas the thing that makes Die Hard so tense is that McClane could just as easy get killed by the cops as by the bad guys as they both hate him. In that building, he has few allies and no-one else to turn to. This tension makes Die Hard the unique film that it is.Best action film of all time?

I am a huge baseball fan so I thought I'd watch it, and I was very disappointed. It started out okay.. When I saw the bad influence DeNiro had on his young son, I was hoping that he would become a better father throughout the movie or something. Anyways, at the beginning it seemed as if DeNiro was supposed to be the protagonist. He was the only one that believed in Bobby, and he had his adorable son that he was losing custody of, which gave me a reason to feel bad for him. He wanted to help Bobby by talking to Primo, when out of absolutely nowhere he brutally stabs Primo to death... Not to mention that sketchy reoccurring song I WANT TO **** YOU!!!! at random unfitting moments.Later, when DeNiro saves Bobby's son from drowning, I was hoping that the movie could redeem itself.. He could forgive himself for killing Primo if he saved Bobby's son. But of course this is far beyond the depth of the movie, because all he cares about is getting CREDIT for the murder, and does so by stealing Bobby's son, car, and dog and holding them hostage- Bobby just has to hit a home run and announce that DeNiro is a true fan while displaying a picture of him biting a knife.Now we get to the completely unrealistic scene at the end... It is pouring like hell and we are expected to believe that the game hasn't been called. Then DeNiro somehow magically appears on the field in an umpire suit and calls Bobby out at home, proceeding to pull out his knife and start stabbing everyone that runs onto the field. There are seemingly no officers on the field (but the police are on their way), so DeNiro steps on the mound and prepares to pitch a knife to Bobby when he gets shot to death. But don't worry, this cheerful and pleasant movie has a happy ending, because Bobby find his son.This is NOT a sports movie. It is NOT about a fan. As far as I know, fans are not rabid psychopaths that threaten, rob, and throw knives at their admirees. This is likely to be the sickest movie I will ever see in my life. The plot was shallow, the soundtrack sucked, the movie had no purpose whatsoever. I warn you not to waste your time on this disgusting excuse for a film.

Not sure what this is leading too. But never have I seen such dignity in a love relationship - especially an extra martial one. It's not even right for me to label this as an 'extra martial affair'. This just so limits and in a way kills the kind of relation the lead pair - Mrs Chang and Mr Chow has.Mr Chow, a newspaper editor and Mrs Chang, a secretary, are neighbours who have just moved into the same apartment complex with their respective spouses. But her executive husband is always on tours and his wife is hardly ever to be seen, working in multiple work-shifts. All seems pretty normal at the outset, Mr Chow and Mrs Chang leading their respective lives waiting for the spouses to return, hoping that all is OK with their marriages even though the signs said otherwise. Loneliness becomes a more constant companion for both of them and yet they just acknowledge each other's presence whenever they meet - at one level knowing what it is like to live alone, to perform simple daily chores alone - like having dinner by oneself most of the days - when they should be at home eating with their partners. At such instances when the characters are alone, even if they are with other people, the scenes are done in slow-motion just so gently emphasizing this fact to the audience. I could feel it within me. There is no simmering sexual tension or physical attraction ever between the two; just mutual understanding of how lonely the other is. What gets them to interact is when one day they find out that their spouses are having an affair. Devastated, they slowly seek comfort in the other - not by getting into a fling and getting physical at the first opportunity - but by lending a hand of support, listening, helping out in the daily chores, eating together, just being there for the other. Slowly both begin to realize that they too have got on the same track as their partners - the path of having an extra marital affair. And this is the point where the film becomes what it is - both vow never to do anything like their partners; never get involved - else what's the difference between them then? It is this maturity of the characters that to a large extent helps them to be there and care for the other and yet not cross the line of getting into a full-blown illicit relationship. But how long can this restraint last? What happens then? Ever action of the two is like a layer being peeled to reveal their inner strength and character. Even when Mr Chang admits how tough it has become for them to be like this, that scene is so charged even though there is no physical touch involved (expect for a handshake that said it all). Very poetic and painful to watch this. Even deep emotions like sadness, anger, the slight urge to get even are handled like as though these had to be just absorbed within, not lashed out at the other. I thought otherwise worked but this film showed me that I could be wrong. It hurt. The director sets the perfect ambiance for the subject - the background colours, the outfits that Mrs Chang always wears - high collared - I felt that it suited her character more - the kind who maintains her respect and position, no matter that she could be crumbling inside. The music was such that it was in a way wailing and mourning for the sadness and pain that the two had to go through. There had to be some form of outlet and here its the background score that does this. Dialogues are short and convey the feelings aptly. But what takes this film to another level altogether (apart from the story and the script - even though this took shape as the film was being shot) is the lead pair played by Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu Wai. To say that they had an amazing chemistry is quite erroneous I feel. No, this isn't it. Both seemed to have such an amazing understanding of the characters that they just knew what it is like to be betrayed by a spouse, what it is like to fall in love again, what it is like to show restraint and navigate through the pain all by themselves and to make that final decision that then defines the future for them.

All seems pretty normal at the outset, Mr Chow and Mrs Chang leading their respective lives waiting for the spouses to return, hoping that all is OK with their marriages even though the signs said otherwise. Loneliness becomes a more constant companion for both of them and yet they just acknowledge each other's presence whenever they meet - at one level knowing what it is like to live alone, to perform simple daily chores alone - like having dinner by oneself most of the days - when they should be at home eating with their partners. At such instances when the characters are alone, even if they are with other people, the scenes are done in slow-motion just so gently emphasizing this fact to the audience. I could feel it within me. There is no simmering sexual tension or physical attraction ever between the two; just mutual understanding of how lonely the other is. What gets them to interact is when one day they find out that their spouses are having an affair. Devastated, they slowly seek comfort in the other - not by getting into a fling and getting physical at the first opportunity - but by lending a hand of support, listening, helping out in the daily chores, eating together, just being there for the other. Slowly both begin to realize that they too have got on the same track as their partners - the path of having an extra marital affair. And this is the point where the film becomes what it is - both vow never to do anything like their partners; never get involved - else what's the difference between them then? It is this maturity of the characters that to a large extent helps them to be there and care for the other and yet not cross the line of getting into a full-blown illicit relationship. But how long can this restraint last? What happens then? Ever action of the two is like a layer being peeled to reveal their inner strength and character. Even when Mr Chang admits how tough it has become for them to be like this, that scene is so charged even though there is no physical touch involved (expect for a handshake that said it all). Very poetic and painful to watch this. Even deep emotions like sadness, anger, the slight urge to get even are handled like as though these had to be just absorbed within, not lashed out at the other. I thought otherwise worked but this film showed me that I could be wrong. It hurt. The director sets the perfect ambiance for the subject - the background colours, the outfits that Mrs Chang always wears - high collared - I felt that it suited her character more - the kind who maintains her respect and position, no matter that she could be crumbling inside. The music was such that it was in a way wailing and mourning for the sadness and pain that the two had to go through. There had to be some form of outlet and here its the background score that does this. Dialogues are short and convey the feelings aptly. But what takes this film to another level altogether (apart from the story and the script - even though this took shape as the film was being shot) is the lead pair played by Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu Wai. To say that they had an amazing chemistry is quite erroneous I feel. No, this isn't it. Both seemed to have such an amazing understanding of the characters that they just knew what it is like to be betrayed by a spouse, what it is like to fall in love again, what it is like to show restraint and navigate through the pain all by themselves and to make that final decision that then defines the future for them. They just knew it. And when this happens what we get on screen is pure magic. Nothing less.Beautiful film. It's a work of art.

It's considered a classic because of Ennio Morricone iconic theme and because it has Clint Eastwood in it. The plot what plot. There is not consistent plot. Only action scenes upon action scenes pieced together to create a three hour long bore fest. I think I would rather take the three hour tour in Gillian's Island and get shipwrecked on a island then watch this turd again. It's as if Sergio Leone who made a masterpiece with Once Upon a Time in the West and another great film in Fistful of Dollars went to his screenwriter and said lets make a film with many showcased action sequences and piece them together with our twenty page screenplay. The result a paper thin, very thin story with no solid characterization or development.The movie is more like the adventures of the man with no name and his annoying nerdy partner Tuco who can't shut the hell up. The pair play one another in con games, shootouts, duels, and other antics. They both happen to fall upon a deserted stage wagon full of dead men where they learn the secret to ones fate of hidden gold. They both end up in a Civil War prison camp, right in the middle of a Civil War battle and other clueless adventures in a story that might have been written by a couple of adolescents. Just one adventure after another that has nothing to do with telling a strong story. This film is like a clumsy, sloppy serial with no motivation by any of the characters involved.The one thing that make Sergio Leone films so great is the style and action. The action sequences in the film are dull and not the least bit engaging. The Civil War battles look way too much like a World War battle. The duels and showdowns that were so thrilling and fun to watch in the previous two films I mentioned are drawn out here in very long and tiresome sequences. Especially the duel climax which is almost laughable which consists of endless and endless shots of eyes, guns, expressions. The whole thing last for a total of 5 minutes and after it ends the viewer like me is not excited, but more relieved that it's over. Any longer I would of fast forwarded it. Other sequences such as showdowns in western towns are mere cartoonish and over the top.Even Leone's style of film-making isn't impressive. There are some shots that amuse me, especially the desert sequence which had artistic look to it. However, because of so many drawn out long boring sequences I really start losing focus on the art of film-making and really don't care anymore about this shot or that shot. That's not the case in Once Upon a Time in the West or Fistful of Dollars.As for the characters in the film. Clint Eastwood's portrayal of the man with no name is no longer mysterious or cool like he was in Fistful of Dollars. I've never seen the second man with no name film. In this film he's more of a spoof. Talks very little, but he's way to silly and not serious enough. As for Elliah Wallach his role of Tuco is way too comic and not the least bit intimating. He's also extremely annoying and he's also ugly. As for Lee Van Cliff his turn as Angel Eyes is the only character that I somewhat enjoyed. He played the part well with his narrow eyes, but he was in far too little of the film.Too sum it all up I'm extremely disappointed at the final result of this film. So many people love it. I don't know why. My theory is that the ones who love it are too dumb to realize why they like it and don't know what a great film is. Once Upon a Time in the West is a great film and so is Fistful of Dollars. I've seen The Good the Bad and the Ugly three times now and every time I watch it I hate more and more.

In this film Alstair Sim (who would play Scrooge the next year) has his best performance in any film of his I have seen in addition to the classic as Wymans father. The support in this film is so strong that by the end, the viewer does not care about the beginning not making complete sense because Hitch & the actors have overcome that with a well made movie.Hitchcocks next Warner film would be Dial M For Murder. While that one is more famous, this movie filmed in London with a strong British cast is worth while viewing.

It is a supremely confident Martin Scorsese at his storytelling best! It is perhaps his last true masterpiece (so far). GOODFELLAS is the anti-gangster film. The anti-GODFATHER, GOODFELLAS tells the sordid, sleazy side of the gangster. It is realistic in presentation, but still has that Scorcese touch of flair and the characters jump out at the screen at you.GOODFELLAS is the story of one Henry Hill (played memorably by Ray Liotta, who also narrates most of the film). Henry was raised in Brooklyn in the 50s and ended up friends with a local hood Tommy DeVito, who was connected to the mob. As an adult Tommy is played by Joe Pesci in a performance that deservedly won him the Best Supporting Actor award of 1990. Pesci's speech was short but memorable (the Academy really deserves few words of thanks from anyone, but this time, they got the winner right). Tommy is a borderline psychopath who snaps at the slightest hint of disrespect towards him. These moments are simultaneously hilarious and frightening to watch, because they seem so real and Pesci perfectly relays the hotheadedness of Tommy.Tommy works for the larger mob, run by Paulie Cicero (a well cast Paul Sorvino in fine form). The go-to guy though for both Henry and Tommy is Paulie's right hand man Jimmy Conway (played by the great Robert DeNiro in one of his most underrated performances). DeNiro really carries GOODFELLAS for me. Scorcese ALWAYS seems to bring out the best in DeNiro. He really seems to know what makes this actor tick. And it works to perfection in GOODFELLAS.Together, the triumvirate of Henry, Tommy, and Jimmy successfully gangster-ize their way through the 50s, 60s, and 70s (well, 2 of them made it that far!). The convos in GOODFELLAS are what really strike me. They seem so authentic and scary. These guys plot, scheme, cajole, and kill with such alarming ease that it is almost a revelation that guys like this really existed. They are completely embedded in this world. They love being GOODFELLAS.Also memorable is Best Supporting Actress nominee Lorraine Bracco as Henry's wife Karen, who gets narrate a small part of the film herself. Initially disgusted by Henry and his world, Karen becomes intoxicated by it and caught in it herself. The biggest star of GOODFELLAS is probably the cinematography long tracking shots, character closeups at key moments, zoom-ins to characters at important points, slightly shaky camera action, etc. It magnifies the effect of this deadly life that these people have chosen to be a part of. The use of era music is done to great effect as well, in addition to capturing the essence of the 50s through the 70s. Great work all around.GOODFELLAS was nominated for Best Picture in 1990 and should have won. Scorsese absolutely should have won Best Director. A real modern classic.

Great work all around.GOODFELLAS was nominated for Best Picture in 1990 and should have won. Scorsese absolutely should have won Best Director. A real modern classic. Heck, a classic in any time period! ","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"17 August 2008","score":"","review":" GOODFELLAS came out in the first year of the 90s and was so good it stayed one of the best films by the end of the decade. It is a supremely confident Martin Scorsese at his storytelling best! It is perhaps his last true masterpiece (so far). GOODFELLAS is the anti-gangster film. The anti-GODFATHER, GOODFELLAS tells the sordid, sleazy side of the gangster. It is realistic in presentation, but still has that Scorcese touch of flair and the characters jump out at the screen at you.GOODFELLAS is the story of one Henry Hill (played memorably by Ray Liotta, who also narrates most of the film). Henry was raised in Brooklyn in the 50s and ended up friends with a local hood Tommy DeVito, who was connected to the mob. As an adult Tommy is played by Joe Pesci in a performance that deservedly won him the Best Supporting Actor award of 1990. Pesci's speech was short but memorable (the Academy really deserves few words of thanks from anyone, but this time, they got the winner right). Tommy is a borderline psychopath who snaps at the slightest hint of disrespect towards him. These moments are simultaneously hilarious and frightening to watch, because they seem so real and Pesci perfectly relays the hotheadedness of Tommy.Tommy works for the larger mob, run by Paulie Cicero (a well cast Paul Sorvino in fine form). The go-to guy though for both Henry and Tommy is Paulie's right hand man Jimmy Conway (played by the great Robert DeNiro in one of his most underrated performances). DeNiro really carries GOODFELLAS for me. Scorcese ALWAYS seems to bring out the best in DeNiro. He really seems to know what makes this actor tick. And it works to perfection in GOODFELLAS.Together, the triumvirate of Henry, Tommy, and Jimmy successfully gangster-ize their way through the 50s, 60s, and 70s (well, 2 of them made it that far!). The convos in GOODFELLAS are what really strike me. They seem so authentic and scary. These guys plot, scheme, cajole, and kill with such alarming ease that it is almost a revelation that guys like this really existed. They are completely embedded in this world. They love being GOODFELLAS.Also memorable is Best Supporting Actress nominee Lorraine Bracco as Henry's wife Karen, who gets narrate a small part of the film herself. Initially disgusted by Henry and his world, Karen becomes intoxicated by it and caught in it herself. The biggest star of GOODFELLAS is probably the cinematography long tracking shots, character closeups at key moments, zoom-ins to characters at important points, slightly shaky camera action, etc. It magnifies the effect of this deadly life that these people have chosen to be a part of.
