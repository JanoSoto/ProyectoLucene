What are the limits of this freedom and how can we then meaningfully correlate with the existing knowledge matrix (and this movie is itself part of The Matrix) of the now diffuse and globalized culture of this world? These questions have been asked by seers, visionaries and thinkers in all parts of the world for millennia. The answers, descriptions, interpretations provided by these people found in the various myths, are so diverse and different that it's mind boggling to the non-thinker, but quite a challenge to the explorer. Levi Strauss put it this way A theoretically infinite number of versions of the myth will be generated, each slightly different from the others. Myth thus becomes the third dimension of language; in it a continuous attempt is made to reconcile the other two dimensions of language - the diachronic and the synchronic. Because complete reconciliation is impossible, myth grows spiral - wise until the intellectual impulse which has produced it is exhausted. Myth grows then, because, structurally, the contradiction - the asymmetry &#x96; which gives it life cannot be resolved. Different versions are part of the same myth precisely because a myth is not reducible to a single uniform content, but is a dynamic structure. Eventually all the versions of a myth have to be taken into consideration so as its structure can become apparent. So if any of these questions has ever bothered you, then welcome to The Matrix, the command and control system of the world that is by the necessary order of things, hidden from us for the very simple reason that it must be beyond individual manipulation (yes, the factual flaw in the movie is that the Matrix can be hacked). The only thing that The Matrix will allow is for the determined individual is to have a glimpse or a series of images of itself, but the interpretation of those is only one such interpretation that ideally should have correlation to interpretations that others have given. The test of a true myth is that each time you return to it, new insights and interpretations arise (Starhawk). Good luck to you and hope you 'see' The Matrix, that is, if you really want to.

In a way these things are practically creating a certain existence and when we read or write these stories we suspend our disbelief because depending on how much we enjoy the story we want to almost believe it's real.This is my third favorite movie from my favorite movie director John Carpenter and it's also one of my personal favorite films in general; but also the last in his apocalypse trilogy (my favorite is The Thing) It's one of those surreal horror films or just films in general you don't see often it's something that shows up on an occasional amount of years or could slip though the cracks. This isn't just a film it's an experience, because it thinks outside the box and beyond. It was also a little love letter and satire of H.P. Lovecroft stories which is cool because I'm a fan of his stories.I like it's plot which it's a bit uncannily similar to the film The Ninth Gate but that's a different story. Anyway in format it seems like a simple tracking mission mystery but what makes those kinds of plots interesting is one thing always turns into another, and this film does that but takes a more radical approach because it screws with you perception of reality in the film and pulls the rug from under you when you least expect it to.The protagonist despite unreliable is good, Insurance investigator John Trent played well by underrated actor Sam Neil. John is a cynic\/realist and control freak. He loves to exercise disillusionment and his job supports it, but the thing about him is he has a low viewpoint on humanity in general probably due to the encounter of one scam artist too many in his profession. This fallible almost could make him unlikeable but what makes him likable at least to me is he always has a sense of humor, he's not afraid to satires on himself, this almost gives us a small sense of hope that he will be capable of doing what he should to combat evil. But as I've said he's an unreliable protagonist I like at times how you question this character's sanity because there are time it seems like he could be losing it, like when he cut the covers of the paperback copies of Sutter Kane. And just the simple fact these are forces that are forces beyond his control and understanding. The antagonist Sutter Kane is also great despite not being in the film that long he just has this presence where on the outside he seems like an ordinary guy (like most authors are) but you sense there is something supernatural about him, after all everything he's written has came true.I love the unsettling feeling it gives you, once again John's trademark feeling of isolation, doom and dread which help successfully add to the feeling that the world could be ending. From all the weird crap that happens in the film you just aren't sure of anything. The special effects from K and B are great, I even like the town setting which are reminiscent of the Silent Hill video game series since it always takes place in a town with supernatural activity. We see some Chtulu like creatures, some street gang that look all messed up, and one scene that always gave me the creeps was the infamous boy on a bike scene, it was creepy because it underlined the inescapable truth that we were young once but growing old. And my favorite set piece is the Black Chirch which is the spookiest church I've ever seen, with it's inverted crosses and that mural one look at it gave me the creeps. There is just so much going on in the film that it would require more than one watch to see it all. It's the philosophical conundrum of the giant floating turtle all over again only in a really twisted sense, in that story it was about how our world was really the back of a giant floating turtle; in this film it's on the possibility our world is really a story written by a writer. And of course the music as usual is great, I love the theme song it's just so cool it's one of my favorite movie themes ever.The film really gets at our perception of reality, are we really in reality or could we truly be characters from a book after all as a saying goes life is a story. As well as something dark that is if we really have it in us to save humanity as a whole. The task to finding a book has became a cause to save humankind but the thing is Trent is good at dealing with only the practical problems in his profession which is pulling the curtain of fraud from fraud, here it's different because the problem is supernatural which are forces beyond his understanding which makes Trent powerless, despite Trent's efforts at trying to save humanity we discover they prove fruitless.In the Mouth of Madness is a roller coaster ride into the heart and soul of darkness that you wouldn't mind riding again and read some good books.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"24 May 2012","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The bizarre thing sometimes about writing and reading fictional books are they are always about heightened or different realities.

Vance plays Jim as a runaway slave who is looking for freedom. They go and try to get Jim freed, and as they go they encounter multiple problems throughout the movie. Ron Perlman plays Huck's father, and in the movie he is the reason on why Huck goes on the adventure. He goes on this adventure to try to get away from his alcoholic dad. This movie was in the 1850's and the place is in Mississippi. The film is comedy mixed with adventure. In the movie the adventures of Huck Finn, Huck is a young boy in the 1850's who runs from home to get away from his alcoholic dad. He meets a runaway slave named Jim and from there the two undertake a series of adventures throughout the movie. Jim gets caught up in Huck's problems as he drags Jim into them. Huck and Jim meet two men who are pretending to be the Wilro brothers and once again Jim gets involved in this situation. When the real brothers arrive in the town, it creates a problem that Huck and Finn get involved. The towns people ask questions, like who are the real brothers and the four guys start asking each other questions about England and that doesn't help because the towns people have no information about England. Jim on the other hand is in jail because he is wanted for murder. When Huck helps Jim escape from jail they are running for their lives when one of the towns people shoots Huck and they miss their chance to escape from that place. You will have to watch the movie to see what happens next. One aspect of filmmaking that I want to talk about is the background. Throughout the movie the background is one of the most important piece to make a movie. I think it is that because the background has to match the problem\/plot of the movie to make it more interesting. It gives it image and it plays a big part in filmmaking. I haven't really thought about the background being an important aspect in filmmaking, but now that I researched bout it I do believe that it is very important. I can actually guarantee that if you take out the background movies wouldn't be that exciting to watch.Next I'm going to compare stereotypes of characteristics of the age of realism. Each character in the movie has a last name except for Jim. I think its because he is a slave and during that time period slaves weren't that important. Another example is in the beginning of the movie Jim was performing a magic trick to other people and many people were surprised because they wouldn't think that a slave would be educated. Also when Huck and Jim arrive to America, there is a fight that breaks out and an American pulls out his gun and shoots the guy and says welcome to America. That's a stereotype because the movie us tying to portray that all Americans are stubborn and arrogant. This movie shows a lot of stereotypes and these are just a few examples I talked about. I think the movie did a good job showing what was going on in the 1850's. There was abolitionism and stereotypes. The movie actually showed optimism instead of realism. People didn't really overcome racism in a short period of time, in the real world it took hundreds of years to overcome and in the movie racism is overcome in the end of the movie. My overall reaction to this film is, it was a good and interesting movie. I loved it because it had some funny parts that made me laugh. It also had drama in it, which makes it interesting to watch. My mood was overall the same, I loved it. I would recommend people to watch this movie. I rate this movie 5 gold coins.

Vance plays Jim as a runaway slave who is looking for freedom. They go and try to get Jim freed, and as they go they encounter multiple problems throughout the movie. Ron Perlman plays Huck's father, and in the movie he is the reason on why Huck goes on the adventure. He goes on this adventure to try to get away from his alcoholic dad. This movie was in the 1850's and the place is in Mississippi. The film is comedy mixed with adventure. In the movie the adventures of Huck Finn, Huck is a young boy in the 1850's who runs from home to get away from his alcoholic dad. He meets a runaway slave named Jim and from there the two undertake a series of adventures throughout the movie. Jim gets caught up in Huck's problems as he drags Jim into them. Huck and Jim meet two men who are pretending to be the Wilro brothers and once again Jim gets involved in this situation. When the real brothers arrive in the town, it creates a problem that Huck and Finn get involved. The towns people ask questions, like who are the real brothers and the four guys start asking each other questions about England and that doesn't help because the towns people have no information about England. Jim on the other hand is in jail because he is wanted for murder. When Huck helps Jim escape from jail they are running for their lives when one of the towns people shoots Huck and they miss their chance to escape from that place. You will have to watch the movie to see what happens next. One aspect of filmmaking that I want to talk about is the background. Throughout the movie the background is one of the most important piece to make a movie. I think it is that because the background has to match the problem\/plot of the movie to make it more interesting. It gives it image and it plays a big part in filmmaking. I haven't really thought about the background being an important aspect in filmmaking, but now that I researched bout it I do believe that it is very important. I can actually guarantee that if you take out the background movies wouldn't be that exciting to watch.Next I'm going to compare stereotypes of characteristics of the age of realism. Each character in the movie has a last name except for Jim. I think its because he is a slave and during that time period slaves weren't that important. Another example is in the beginning of the movie Jim was performing a magic trick to other people and many people were surprised because they wouldn't think that a slave would be educated. Also when Huck and Jim arrive to America, there is a fight that breaks out and an American pulls out his gun and shoots the guy and says welcome to America. That's a stereotype because the movie us tying to portray that all Americans are stubborn and arrogant. This movie shows a lot of stereotypes and these are just a few examples I talked about. I think the movie did a good job showing what was going on in the 1850's. There was abolitionism and stereotypes. The movie actually showed optimism instead of realism. People didn't really overcome racism in a short period of time, in the real world it took hundreds of years to overcome and in the movie racism is overcome in the end of the movie. My overall reaction to this film is, it was a good and interesting movie. I loved it because it had some funny parts that made me laugh. It also had drama in it, which makes it interesting to watch. My mood was overall the same, I loved it. I would recommend people to watch this movie. I rate this movie 5 gold coins.

Vance and is saved by a young boy named Huck Finn played by Elijah Wood which took place in the 1950's in Mississippi. This film is very adventurist movie that has lots of foreshadowing. Huck Finn is a young 10 year old boy that has an abusive father and his name is Pap and is played by Ron Perlman. Finn lives with a lady that is named Widow Douglas played by Dana Luey, and one day Huck fights this young boy down by the river and sees this fathers foot print in the dirt and runs to go see the physic Jim. And that night Hucks father kidnaps him and takes him to his house where he starts to beat him, and the only way he can escape is by faking his own murder. So then Huck runs to the woods and that's where he finds Jim. They run off together and go on their adventure and then they catch up with two men named Duke and King and they pretend to be people they aren't so they can get a lot my money. In the end Duke and King get tared and feathered. And Huck and Jim run away. Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn in the Age of Realism, which in time was when slavery was very popular and blacks were treated poorly, and this is why it was a good idea that Jim traveled with Huck because he was white and Jim couldn't make all the decisions on his own because he was treated so poorly because of his race. So this shows a white 10 year old boy is superior to a elder black man. In this movie Disney has a way of switching things around in the movie, for example they make it look like slavery is so easy to get out of if you get caught but in reality its not. Also in the end of the movie Mary Jane stops the towns people by saying leave them alone! but really it took over 200+ years from them to embolism slavery in the real world.

Elijah Wood played the adventurous young boy Huck Finn. Huck runs away with a slave, Jim, Courtney B. Vance, and their goal is to make it to freedom for Jim. This is a dangerous journey through Mississippi for a slave in the 1950s.Huck Finn is a young boy who lives with two old woman because his father, Pap, is not a nice man. Pap decides to take him out of his home one night and brings him to his own house. While at his dad's house, Huck has to be careful because Pap is scary when he is drunk. In order to escape from Pap's life, Huck fakes his own murder. He starts out on a journey but on the first day he comes across Jim in the woods. They decide to travel together but they have to be extra careful who they run into because Jim is blamed for Huck's murder. Eventually, they run into two thieves, Duke and King, who bring them along with them to pretend to be people they are not. Their lies finally catch up with them and they have to carefully find their way out of the situation. Watch the movie to find out what twists this movie takes at the end.This movie does an excellent job of staying in the 1950s time period. The way the slaves are treated and enslaved was really how they were treated. The two boys get stuck on a plantation and Jim is enslaved. Huck sees how Jim is treated and wants to leave. The dialects of the people tell that they are from the South. The way the people dress also keeps with the time period.

I mean, it's as if he could burst out with a melanoma at any moment. If you just glanced at this thing with the sound off, you might think it's a story about an Indian immigrant who gets mixed up with a family of albinos. Seriously, can someone colorize this thing and make Grant look more like a human being and less like a catcher's mitt? To Catch a Thief is too good a film to be marred by a leading man who appears to have stepped right out of a broiler.Trading less on suspense and director Alfred Hitchcock's visual mastery, it's the sparkling dialog of writer John Michael Hayes and the light-as-a-feather\/sharp-as-a-tack interplay of Grant, co-star Grace Kelly, supporting actress Brigitte Auber and the delightful Jessie Royce Landis that really make this a near classic. Which says a lot about Hitchcock that he could make something so entertaining and stylish without his own sensibility being the dominant feature. And I call it a near classic only in the sense that he has made much better overall movies than this, including ones with these same performers. If you term To Catch a Thief a classic, what do you call them? Super-classics? Ultra-classics? Fred?John Robie (Cary Grant) is a former jewel thief and French Resistance fighter who's been living on lifetime parole in the South of France. A recent rash of cat burglaries that resemble his work has set the authorities on his trail, though Robie is innocent. His former criminal compatriots are also angry at their old friend for bringing the heat down on them, so Robie cooks up a plan with an insurance agent (John Williams) to track down the real villain. Robie ingratiates himself with a rich woman and her coolly beautiful daughter (Jessie Royce Landis and Grace Kelly), waiting for the thief to try and make off with their expensive jewelry. But the daughter, Frances, finds Robie almost irresistible and in romantically sparring with her, he loses his chance to catch the thief. That leads to a third act of rather perfunctory plot twists and Hitchcock mixing his own brand of dramatic tension with a setting more suitable for a screwball comedy.When I undersell Hitchcock's contributions to this film, don't get me wrong. To Catch a Thief frequently looks great and has some delightfully staged scenes. However, the dialog here is so strong and the performances are so engaging, it's easy to imagine another filmmaker taking this same script and cast and turning out something almost as funny and captivating as the original. How many movies from someone of Hitchcock's stature can you even think that about?Grant is, naturally, Grant. He does seem a smidge to old to be playing opposite Grace Kelly, though that may be entirely due to his aggressive tannitude, but he still exudes that effortless grace and charm and perfectly balances the deadly serious aspects of John Robie with some very broadly comedic moments. Kelly, though, is the hands down star of the show and not because she's physically stunning in a way few females have ever been. She is marvelously nuanced as a very smart and commanding young woman who is often trying to act much more mature than she truly is. Kelly is playing a character who is putting on her own performance for the rest of the world and Kelly perfectly nails that duality. And Jessie Royce Landis isn't far behind as Frances' defiantly down-to-earth mother. It's a role designed for comic relief and Landis makes her more real than anyone else on screen. Throw in John Williams and you've almost got a master class in acting as four very different individuals are made to fit together like a well oiled machine.John Michael Hayes' writing, while a bit weak in the plot, is outstanding whenever anyone opens their mouth. He came up with brilliant repartee that succeeds in making you forget what an outstanding job is being done by the actors speaking it. The moments between Grant and Kelly are dazzlingly witty and the stuff with Grant and Brigitte Auber as the daughter of one of Robie's old cronies isn't far behind. It often seems like clever dialog is the end all, be all in much of modern screen writing, but here's a mid-21st century scribe who puts most of it to shame.To Catch a Thief is pretty much a must see, though maybe only after viewing some of Hitchcock's even more impressive productions.

Butterfly was released in Brazil, back in 1993. I was just 13 years old then, but already loved Cronenberg films. The Crying Game had come out a year earlier, to much critical acclaim and financial success. M. Butterfly was thematically similar, but slightly better than Neil Jordan's movie. What it unfortunately wasn't is as financially successful. I must say that what kept audiences away wasn't Cronenberg's fault, but maybe a wrong perception of the picture. The film relied heavily on the twist. In this particular case, on the fact that Irons' butterfly was, in fact, a man, which should be this big secret, to be revealed at the last half hour. It was a lost cause, a twist the heads at Warner Bros. couldn't back up one would simply need to take a look at the poster and find the John Lone name right next to Jeremy Irons, to guess where this story is heading. The thing is, butterfly's sexuality wasn't important to this story, as much as people tend to think so. We know that in the real case the film was based on, the Rene Gallimard person was a bisexual man, which is very telling. My take is, there was a part of him, throughout all those years, that knew that his butterfly was a man. He chose to live the illusion, to blind himself from the truth, and it was perfect while it lasted. A moment that underlines this assumption is when John Lone enters the courtroom. The look Irons gives to him, he isn't surprised or devastated. He gives a knowing smile. Once the fantasy slips away with the woman's costume, it's over for Rene and Song Liling. I believe that M. Butterfly should not be taken as a movie with a twist, because there is none, the truth is right at our faces the whole time, but as a gripping, highly magnetic character study, a look into obsession, and a well-made period piece, a window of sorts to a part of the history of China we didn't really fully know. Dead Ringers remains the defining moment in David Cronenberg's career, but M. Butterfly is a great one, nonetheless, and highly recommended.

He spends the majority of his days playing hooky from school, getting into fights, and lying to his guardians Mrs. Watson (Mary Louise Wilson)and Widow Douglas (Dana Ivey) about how he got black eyes. One day, Huck's drunken, abusive father (Ron Perlman) arrives and takes his son away with him, looking for a way to get his hands on $600 left to Huck by his mother who is deceased. Huck escapes from his father's cabin, after a night of fighting for his life, and, in the company of a runaway slave named Jim (Courtney B.

When I worked in sales, I would stick in a Moonstruck reference when trying to convince someone to buy the step up, saying This is pretty good, unless something goes wrong. And something ALWAYS goes wrong. When cooking in our house, the request for someone to hand the cook the butcher knife is always, CHRISSY, BRING ME THE BIG KNIFE! (and there's no one named Chrissy in my family). If anyone says the word temporary someone will inevitably say, EVERYTHING IS TEMPORARY! Yes, we've seen Moonstruck a lot! Awesome movie. Great acting, great cast, likable characters...and it's not even a movie that needed to have a twisted storyline or absolute angst. It's one of those rare movies that really doesn't have much in the way of weaknesses. It's a simple slice of life film about two Italian families in Brooklyn. Simple as that. With the lovably passionate, eccentric personalities that come from such a culture as New York Italian, there's little need to insert jokes into this movie. The reality of the almost poetic communication among the family members is funny (at times hilarious!) enough. Plus, anyone who is passionate about Italian food like I am gets the urge the take a day trip to Little Italy to pick up a good loaf of bread every time they see the bread Ronny takes out of his bakery's old coal-fired brick oven! Every character is believable and likable, flaws and all. Loretta is a superstitious, but smart and level-headed widow who, in a rare loss of self-control, makes a passionate decision that causes a riotous chain of events within her family. Cosmo, Loretta's father, is a successful plumber who, now in his mid to late 60s, has begun to feel he has done nothing with his life and fears death. He turns to extramarital affairs in order to fill gaps he feels are in his life. Rose, the cynical, dry-witted wife of Cosmo and mother of Loretta, remains supportive and loving of her husband and daughter despite their moral failings. There's Johnny, Loretta's soft-spoken fiancé, is still controlled emotionally by his mother, who lives in Sicily. Ronny, Johnny's estranged brother, is an impulsive and tortured man who developed a vendetta against happiness ever since he lost his hand in a bread slicer (causing his then-fiancé, who did not want to be with a crippled man, to leave him). That is, until he meets Loretta. There's Raymond, Rose's brother, and his wife, Rita, who are still madly in love even after being married for many, many years. And there's the Old Man, Cosmo's immigrant father who spends most of his time sneaking table food to his many dogs (much to Rose's dismay), scolding them in Italian, and grunting his displeasure and exasperation with his family's chaos and morally questionable activities. Despite being frail and old, he is shown to still be very wise and authoritative, condemning Cosmo for breaking the family and demanding that Cosmo pay for Loretta's wedding.All these personalities come together and make a very ordinary story interesting and funny.All in all, I offer one piece of advice See this movie.

Green realizing that the only way he can get into the meat of the subject,anti-Semitism, is for him to become or pose as a Semite or Jew himself and goes undercover with a change of identity, from Green to Greenberg,doing it. The first shock that Green gets is that he finds out that his own secretary at the magazine Elaine Wales, June Havoc, is not only Jewish in that her real last name is actually Wilinsky but had to anglicize it to Wales in order to get a job at the publication! This the very magazine Smith Weekly that's out to expose the evils of anti-Semitism!Green gets so deep into the subject,in being Jewish, that it starts to effect his love life with his fiancé the magazine's editor John Minify,Albert Dakker, niece the just divorced Kathy Lacy, Dorothy McGuire, whom he accuses of if not in her being anti-Semitic herself but tolerating it by not quitting an exclusive country club in her all white and Waspy hometown of Darien Connecticut that doesn't allow Jews in as members! Things really start to get out of hand when the widowed Green's, who's wife died nine year ago, 12 year old son Tommy, Dave Stockwell,was set upon by his schoolmates who accused him of being not only Jewish but a Dirty Jew and kicked him out of the school yard! That's in them thinking that his motor mouth and outspoken father, in him letting everyone know that he comes in contact with, is in fact Jewish! Even though he doesn't look a bit Jewish and really isn't Jewish at all!It's Green's just back from the war army buddy Capt.Dave Goldman, John Garfield, who's himself Jewish who puts him straight on the matter in how obnoxious he's behaving and is instead of fighting anti-Semitism is actually encouraging and promoting it by is actions! It's also wise old and liberal thinking Moma Green (Anne Revere) Phil Green's bed ridden, from a series of strokes, mother who also sees just how destructive her son has gotten over this anti-Semite story that he's writing which is just about ruining his life! In him pretending to be Jewish her son Phil has become an overly touchy person with a chip on his shoulder the size of the Titanic! Green after his give me your best shot like actions, by insisting that he's Jewish and demanding a room, gets himself kicked out of an all white and no Jews allowed hotel that he finally gets the message as well as his act together. In him banging or typing out an award winning ten page article on the evils of anti-Semitism but also educating himself on the subject. That's by dealing with it in a clam cool and collective way. Not in overreacting to it by stirring the pot in him accusing almost everyone of being anti-Semitic as well as his aggressive and somewhat rude actions where he in pretending to be Jewish almost ends up making it-anti-Semitism-acceptable! P.S Check out actor Sam Jaffe playing the Albert Einstein like Jewish professor Fred Lieberman in the movie. Jaffe was to repeat that role four years later in the movie The Day the Earth Stood Still as the world renowned Jewish physicist Professor, and smartest man in the whole wide world, Jacob Barnhardt.

The first shock that Green gets is that he finds out that his own secretary at the magazine Elaine Wales, June Havoc, is not only Jewish in that her real last name is actually Wilinsky but had to anglicize it to Wales in order to get a job at the publication! This the very magazine Smith Weekly that's out to expose the evils of anti-Semitism!Green gets so deep into the subject,in being Jewish, that it starts to effect his love life with his fiancé the magazine's editor John Minify,Albert Dakker, niece the just divorced Kathy Lacy, Dorothy McGuire, whom he accuses of if not in her being anti-Semitic herself but tolerating it by not quitting an exclusive country club in her all white and Waspy hometown of Darien Connecticut that doesn't allow Jews in as members! Things really start to get out of hand when the widowed Green's, who's wife died nine year ago, 12 year old son Tommy, Dave Stockwell,was set upon by his schoolmates who accused him of being not only Jewish but a Dirty Jew and kicked him out of the school yard! That's in them thinking that his motor mouth and outspoken father, in him letting everyone know that he comes in contact with, is in fact Jewish! Even though he doesn't look a bit Jewish and really isn't Jewish at all!It's Green's just back from the war army buddy Capt.Dave Goldman, John Garfield, who's himself Jewish who puts him straight on the matter in how obnoxious he's behaving and is instead of fighting anti-Semitism is actually encouraging and promoting it by is actions! It's also wise old and liberal thinking Moma Green (Anne Revere) Phil Green's bed ridden, from a series of strokes, mother who also sees just how destructive her son has gotten over this anti-Semite story that he's writing which is just about ruining his life! In him pretending to be Jewish her son Phil has become an overly touchy person with a chip on his shoulder the size of the Titanic! Green after his give me your best shot like actions, by insisting that he's Jewish and demanding a room, gets himself kicked out of an all white and no Jews allowed hotel that he finally gets the message as well as his act together. In him banging or typing out an award winning ten page article on the evils of anti-Semitism but also educating himself on the subject. That's by dealing with it in a clam cool and collective way. Not in overreacting to it by stirring the pot in him accusing almost everyone of being anti-Semitic as well as his aggressive and somewhat rude actions where he in pretending to be Jewish almost ends up making it-anti-Semitism-acceptable! P.S Check out actor Sam Jaffe playing the Albert Einstein like Jewish professor Fred Lieberman in the movie. Jaffe was to repeat that role four years later in the movie The Day the Earth Stood Still as the world renowned Jewish physicist Professor, and smartest man in the whole wide world, Jacob Barnhardt.
