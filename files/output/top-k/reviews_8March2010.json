Wes Craven and to a lesser extent Joss Whedon have just reinvigorated the horror genre with the film Scream and the television show Buffy the Vampire Slayer. So what to do if you're a big movie studio wanting a fast hit? You make a horror movie and cast Buffy herself, Sarah Michelle Gellar, as one of the leads. The result is a nice little film, borrowing from the Scream formula of winking at the audience and MTV casting.The plot four friends, played by Jennifer Love Hewitt (Julie), Ryan Phillipe (Barry), Buffy (Helen) and Freddie Prinz Jr (Ray), go out on a boozy evening drive following 4th of July celebrations in their sleepy little city. On the way home they accidentally hit a man with their car, killing him, and then dump his body in the ocean. A year later Julie starts getting mysterious messages reading I know what you did last summer. As the bodies mount panic increases as Julie, Ray, Barry and Helen try to find out who it is that knows. The cast Phillipe and Gellar are the best actors in this movie and unsurprisingly, it's their scenes which generate the most emotion. Phillipe in particular, you'll feel like strangling as his macho stupidity gets the team in trouble at every turn. Gellar starts off as a selfish character but her plight does generate some sympathy. Hewitt plays a stereotypical horror heroine, while Prinz puts in a typical Freddie Prinz performance, for what that's worth. Johhny Galecki drops in for his typical odd ball effort and actually adds something to the film, while Muse Watson, the villain of the piece is not given much to do.The script again it follows the Scream formula of not taking itself too seriously. There are many scenes which are purposefully ridiculous, such as our very slowly walking villain gaining ground on our sprinting heroes, and a silly resolution when we find out who the killer is.Overall this is a genre film that offers nothing new and is far from essential viewing. Having said that, it is entertaining in spots with some nice kills. I know what you did last summer, while not quite standing tall, does stand as a solid example of late 90s slasher film making.

Back in 1913, a sickly and aging writer (Ambrose Bierce) decided to go to one of the most exciting and dangerous places on the planet--Mexico during the revolution that followed the ouster of the dictator, Porfirio Diaz. While no one knows for sure why he chose to do this, the film's contention that he was suicidal and wanted to go out with a bang seems quite reasonable. However, exactly what happened to the man is a total mystery--and to this day no one knows exactly what happened to him. Contact with his simply stopped! This film seems to create a fictionalized idea of what COULD have happened to Bierce (played by Gregory Peck). However, the film did so by creating a fictionalized character of an American teacher (Jane Fonda) who gets tricked into walking into the midst of the fighting--and, naturally, slowly is won over to the side of the soldiers of Pancho Villa--though Villa himself does not appear in the film until the end. In the meantime, Fonda and Peck meet with and spend time with General Aroyo (I have no idea if he was a real person or fictionalized--I assume he was fictionalized since I found nothing on him on the internet). Aroyo is played by Jimmy Smits.So what did I think of this film? Well, on one hand it was a lovely film. The music and cinematography worked together to make a film that was quite pleasing to the senses. The slow pacing and evocative spirit was quite nice. Plus, the three leads are all very good actors and you have to respect their talents. However, despite these factors, the film also had a lot of problems--too many to make it worth seeking out yourself. While it looked good, the film was, after a while, incredibly boring. The plot just seemed to stagnate after a while and seemed to go no where--like they never really worked out the plot completely. And, the most serious problem is that it's hard to like or relate to the characters. Just when you start to connect with them, they behave in ways that make you either hate them or wonder what the @%## motivates them. It's rare to see a movie that has characters that are more ill-defined--and excellent acting can't make up for that.There is one final problem with the film, though most who watch it won't realize it. As a history teacher, I was well acquainted with the Mexican revolution. The various factions, frankly, were all pretty screwed up! While there were things to admire about Pancho Villa and his faction, he was also a blood-thirsty bandit as well as reformer--provided HE was the one doing all the reforms. As for the alternatives, they weren't any better. The ideas of land reform and democracy were wonderful--too bad no one leading any of the factions really did anything to actually improve the lot for the average Mexican! A lot of people died, but essentially the country wasn't much better off when all was said and done. So, in a war when there are no clear good guys, who do you care about in this film?! As for Miss Fonda and Mr. Peck, they both have been long-time leftists--and very pro-revolution. I strongly suspect that this is why they made this film. I am all in favor of revolution when it means getting rid of evil, but like the Beatles song Revolution, such movements need to have more to them than just a desire to change things. I wish in hindsight they'd chosen a more productive and life-changing revolution to dramatize--such as the Velvet Revolution Czechsolovakia or the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.

But which one of the returning servicemen is it.Is this a message movie or a noir. The two co-exist none too well due to an over-long, heavy-handed scene between detective Finlay (Young) and the hapless Le Roy (Phipps). The tone is low-key, but preachy nonetheless. Unfortunately, even the most worthy message can be undercut by a protracted delivery, as it is here. Too bad, screenwriter Paxton couldn't work his message more organically into the action, instead of interrupting it with what amounts to a static pulpit scene that almost has Young facing the camera.The movie's reputation rests mainly on its three noir icons.

But Sondra's back now and when Clint wants to back out of a bare knuckle fight with reigning eastern champion William Smith because he's tired of the racket, the gangsters backing the fight kidnap her to force him to go through with it.As in the last film, Clyde the orangutan gets the lion's share of the laughs. The sex life of the orangutan gets even more screen time, Clint and Geoff Lewis don't just find a zoo with a female orangutan in it for Clyde to mate with, they actually get him an adjoining motel room with Clyde and his lady love in one room and Clint and Sondra in another.William Smith has the most interesting part in the film, usually he's a thoroughgoing bad guy in his films, but in Any Which Way You Can he's got a sense of honor and fair play, much to the distress of Harry Guardino and the rest of the gangsters backing the fight.Any Which Way You Can has the same sense of rollicking lowbrow comedy that the first film has, maybe more so.

Its bold, expressive visuals are still striking and a treat to watch, and it's not surprising that so many directors have found inspiration there; traces of Metropolis can be found in countless movies such as Brazil, The Fifth Element or Blade Runner, and even in some episodes of Doctor Who.Furthermore, we're now lucky to have a very good restoration available on DVD. Although this most recent release still doesn't contain a rather big part of footage, the gaps are filled by explanation texts (quite unobtrusive, as silent movies contain intertitles anyway) in an attempt to recreate the story in its original 1927 form. Most of the footage thought lost at the time of the DVD's release was recently rediscovered, so I think that we can expect an even better DVD not too far in the future, but due to the mentioned method of filling the gaps, the approximately 30 minutes still missing from this release certainly don't heavily deform the story. Still, if you want the movie in the most complete form imaginable, maybe you should wait for a release including the newly unearthed material.Well, but now... to the story. As said above, a meticulously restored DVD release is available, so we can't blame loss of material for weaknesses of the story. And I have to say, if this were not such a visually amazing movie (with excellent original music, by the way, greatly enhancing the experience), I would give it four points out of 10, and only when feeling generous. This is not a good story. It has nothing to do with the age of the movie - there were many movies in the 1920s telling far better, far more consistent stories than this one.My biggest issue is with the ending For instance, foreman Grot suddenly being accepted as leader of the revolutionary workers, after previously appearing as Fredersen's loyal servant who e.g. dutifully provides Fredersen with the plans found in the pockets of dead workers and who tries to stop their attacks on the machine. Still, at the end, the movie depicts him as the one whom young Freder and Maria have to unite with Fredersen for a happy ending. And that's it - what kind of ending is that? What message? What about the social situation of the workers? It's a false, sentimental pseudo-happy end and the movie's motto ''Mittler zwischen Hirn und Händen muss das Herz sein'' (the heart must be mediator between brain and hands) is pure kitsch, especially in the way it is presented as the grand culmination of the whole movie's meaning.No wonder the German critics largely ditched Metropolis in 1927... maybe underrating (although noting) its visual greatness, but being less forgiving regarding the story than many people nowadays, who maybe think well, it's an old movie - which would be grossly unfair towards what was possible and also achieved in the 1920s in movies, story-wise.Nine points from me, nonetheless!

To add to those problems there are local anti noise protesters causing bad publicity, his wife wants a divorce, his mistress wants to transfer to another city & worse is still to come. Depressed unemployed construction worker D. O. Guerrero (Van Heflin) has decided to take out a huge insurance policy out on his life & plans to board a plane to Rome & blow it up over the Atlantic so his broke wife & kids can collect the $250,000 insurance pay-out. But with an entire plane full of people can he be stopped?Written & directed by George Seaton (although the IMDb lists Henry Hathaway as an uncredited co-director who directed the 'Winter Outdoor Scenes') based on the novel Airport by Arthur Hailey (which was apparently a huge success staying at the top of the best sellers list back in 1968 for 30 weeks!) this is the Gnadaddy of all those star studded disaster flicks like The Poseidon Adventure (1972), The Towering Inferno (1974) & Earthquake (1974) although while later examples went for large scale spectacle Airport most certainly doesn't. I have to confess to being really unimpressed by Airport, for a start it's way too long at two hours sixteen minutes & fifty three seconds long & it takes absolutely ages to get where it wants to go & once it's there it doesn't do much anyway.

These characteristics of idealistic imagery which Moonstruck possesses, spur on an end result of a resounding thumbs up verdict by virtually every prominent critic in Hollywood. Let me describe the circumstances to this film, simply put, they are yesteryear. Moonstruck is a cohesive film which sparks the naivety of an old Italian neighborhood in New York City. New York City has always been one big melting pot that is galvanized by many bicker-some mannerisms which are indicative of typical New Yorkers, this includes a lot of Italian Americans living in New York as well! The mid and late eighties brought on an abrupt conclusion to many strong associations with various cultural stereotypes. Ethnicity polarization was a firmly embedded scourge in American history that was far more prevalent several generations before this movie was made. These generalizing proclivities still exist today, however, they are more mollified and less identifiable! For this Italian family of a bygone era, confusion, indecisiveness, agitation, and yes, of course, love, all have the comical camaraderie of an utterly human understanding to them! The kindred spirits with everyone in Moonstruck seems to be that of comprehending individual frailties. One might wonder about Cher playing the lead role, as she is more known as an entertainer than a big box office first billing star in a movie. In Moonstruck, however, I think she was incredibly well suited to her role, and came off as thoroughly believable in a relatively unbelievable situation. All of the characters in Moonstruck are very rough around the edges, really tough, and not afraid to have a formidable duel with adversity. The most hilarious aspect to their lives is imperfection, and they are thoroughly aware of the fact that weathering the storm definitely serves a constructive purpose! I thought the acting in this movie was sensational. All relationships in this movie garner an auspicious potential to vividly illuminate because everybody knows how everybody else's basic nature is really like!! For this family, nothing is glamorous, nothing is pretentiously romantic, and nothing is overly emotional (just moderately so). The fact is, this entire family is plainly and perpetually afflicted and overcome by an extremely zealous and candid cupid in all of their lives. Taking moon beams literally can indeed have a pleasantly enervating impact on one's resolve, masqueraded mystique, and resistance to the proverbial am ore'. Thus signifying everything!! The homey and mercurial tenet in this film is basically one of ; Be honest, get angry; Be honest, get confrontational; Be honest, get distorted and emphatic; Most importantly; Be honest, and fall in love!! This is Cher's best performance ever as an actress!! Nicholas Cage, Danny Aiello, and Olympia Dukakis, were wonderfully flawed in Moonstruck Such performances by these three were perfectly appropriate for the kinetic energy of the characters in this movie! Director, Norman Jewison (Famous for Cincinnati Kid, Thomas Crowne Affair, and most famous for In The Heat Of The Night which won the academy award for best picture in 1967) depicts many keen and humanistic instincts in the process of purveying the deliberate incongruity to this film! I am Italian American in descent, (Partially anyways) Cher is not Italian, and, for that matter, neither is the writer nor the director! I guess since non-Italians like eating our food, they may as well use our culture to make a fabulous film too! It is refreshing to know that a film can be marvelous and have an incredibly happy ending!! For those of you who didn't like this movie, I just have one thing to say Snap Out Of It!! This movie Moonstruck is totally happy go lucky!! Totally eighties!! and Totally five stars!! See it!!

The year of 1962 may have been when the Hayes Code, a censor system established in the 1930's to prevent audiences of material that could easily be viewed as tasteless or inappropriate in Hollywood-films, was beginning to visibly tear apart. However, the system would still be in function for a few more years, and this did affect CAPE FEAR to a degree; I do believe, however, that what may have been left out of the final film hardly hurt its impact, rather the contrary.Based on a novel by John D. MacDonald, the film covers the story of lawyer Sam Bawden (Gregory Peck), whose idyllic family life in a small-town is suddenly disturbed by the arrival of ex-convict Max Cady (Robert Mitchum); years before, Bawden had served as a witness to Cady attacking a woman, ultimately resulting in him being sentenced to prison. Now released, Cady is determined to terrorize the family, albeit only to a degree where, it seems, he doesn't do anything legally wrong. However, the attitude in his approach makes it very clear that he is planning to go further, which makes Bawden exasperatedly worried particularly because of his daughter Nancy.From this rather uncomfortable premise, we are granted an experience of suspense which manages to be quite thought-provoking at the same time. Director J. Lee Thompson, whose name is seldom being referred to today, takes explicit advantage of both subtle and more direct nuances in the presentation, constantly covering the setting with overwhelming shadows and darkness to provoke forth the frightened aspect of ourselves, while letting some of the most disturbing moments occur in broad daylight, making sure that we are at the edge of our seats throughout, never daring to breathe loose. However, even though we are given no rest, CAPE FEAR does not fall into the trap of using suspense merely as a foil to not make us pay attention to the characters driving the story; especially in the case of lawyer Bawden, his changing appearance as his situation turns all the more serious makes for some quite intriguing characterization. Even though Peck, being as good an actor as he is, never allows the change in Bawden to become distracting in context to his initial, good-natured appearance, we are made increasingly observant to the fact that his eagerness to get rid of Cady, understandable though it is, begins to resemble Cady's own desire for revenge, the only significant difference being that Bawden has a family to be concerned about. This is especially thought-provoking due to Bawden's profession; as a lawyer, Bawden feels that he can't honestly say Cadey should be punished before he's done something against the law, but sometimes your own morals and principles are hard to sustain.However, what is really the high-point of CAPE FEAR, and truly the major reason why it stands as intense as it is, is the performance of Robert Mitchum. Good as I knew Mitchum was, it was this performance which made me recognize the versatility of his acting register; he is so convincing as Max Cadey that I constantly forgot who I was watching, having to remind myself that this is, after all, a performance. He is, plain and simple, magnificent. It is especially with regards to Mitchum's performance that I feel CAPE FEAR was done justice in being released at a time when censorship was more common in Hollywood than it is now; although I am principally against censorship, I do think it has done some movies good in the sense that it forces film-makers to go beyond the simple solutions to deliver their message. Nowadays, all too often a bad guy is given every opportunity to showcase his mean nature, making us tire of him before we reach the climax. By contrast, although Mitchum makes us genuinely terrified of Cady, not until the very end does he reveal just exactly how dangerous he really is, instead turning a bit worse for each step; hence making us paralyzed throughout.CAPE FEAR remains, as directed by J. Lee Thompson and performed by Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum, a quite thought-provoking and thoroughly terrifying experience to this day.

Good as I knew Mitchum was, it was this performance which made me recognize the versatility of his acting register; he is so convincing as Max Cadey that I constantly forgot who I was watching, having to remind myself that this is, after all, a performance. He is, plain and simple, magnificent. It is especially with regards to Mitchum's performance that I feel CAPE FEAR was done justice in being released at a time when censorship was more common in Hollywood than it is now; although I am principally against censorship, I do think it has done some movies good in the sense that it forces film-makers to go beyond the simple solutions to deliver their message. Nowadays, all too often a bad guy is given every opportunity to showcase his mean nature, making us tire of him before we reach the climax. By contrast, although Mitchum makes us genuinely terrified of Cady, not until the very end does he reveal just exactly how dangerous he really is, instead turning a bit worse for each step; hence making us paralyzed throughout.CAPE FEAR remains, as directed by J. Lee Thompson and performed by Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum, a quite thought-provoking and thoroughly terrifying experience to this day. ","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"8 March 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Serving movie-going audiences with some of the most shocking material ever put on film up till that time, CAPE FEAR is interesting not the least because of the period during which it was produced. The year of 1962 may have been when the Hayes Code, a censor system established in the 1930's to prevent audiences of material that could easily be viewed as tasteless or inappropriate in Hollywood-films, was beginning to visibly tear apart. However, the system would still be in function for a few more years, and this did affect CAPE FEAR to a degree; I do believe, however, that what may have been left out of the final film hardly hurt its impact, rather the contrary.Based on a novel by John D. MacDonald, the film covers the story of lawyer Sam Bawden (Gregory Peck), whose idyllic family life in a small-town is suddenly disturbed by the arrival of ex-convict Max Cady (Robert Mitchum); years before, Bawden had served as a witness to Cady attacking a woman, ultimately resulting in him being sentenced to prison. Now released, Cady is determined to terrorize the family, albeit only to a degree where, it seems, he doesn't do anything legally wrong. However, the attitude in his approach makes it very clear that he is planning to go further, which makes Bawden exasperatedly worried particularly because of his daughter Nancy.From this rather uncomfortable premise, we are granted an experience of suspense which manages to be quite thought-provoking at the same time. Director J. Lee Thompson, whose name is seldom being referred to today, takes explicit advantage of both subtle and more direct nuances in the presentation, constantly covering the setting with overwhelming shadows and darkness to provoke forth the frightened aspect of ourselves, while letting some of the most disturbing moments occur in broad daylight, making sure that we are at the edge of our seats throughout, never daring to breathe loose. However, even though we are given no rest, CAPE FEAR does not fall into the trap of using suspense merely as a foil to not make us pay attention to the characters driving the story; especially in the case of lawyer Bawden, his changing appearance as his situation turns all the more serious makes for some quite intriguing characterization. Even though Peck, being as good an actor as he is, never allows the change in Bawden to become distracting in context to his initial, good-natured appearance, we are made increasingly observant to the fact that his eagerness to get rid of Cady, understandable though it is, begins to resemble Cady's own desire for revenge, the only significant difference being that Bawden has a family to be concerned about. This is especially thought-provoking due to Bawden's profession; as a lawyer, Bawden feels that he can't honestly say Cadey should be punished before he's done something against the law, but sometimes your own morals and principles are hard to sustain.However, what is really the high-point of CAPE FEAR, and truly the major reason why it stands as intense as it is, is the performance of Robert Mitchum.

The movie also has a sort of horror aspect to it. While she is getting poisoned the movie takes a dark turn with only Claude Rains character and his mother knowing what was going on.

It was creating puzzles one after another.Indeed, the movie is very emotional and romantic. It has a very good story that has been presented beautifully. During the last half an hour of this film, it seemed to me that nothing can be better than this; while I was expecting a consistently good ending. But, the finishing could not satisfy me, as I desired more-actually, this film was creating desire. But, some people might like the ending too! I personally, do not like to see science-fiction to solve a puzzle because the movie was emotionally romantic, and bringing science-fiction(that seems to me against emotion) into it destroys the flow.Except the ending, I love every thing of this movie. I recommend everyone to watch it. If I am asked what the most influential genre of this movie, I will tell 'romantic'. So, if you want to fell romantic emotion, don't miss it.
