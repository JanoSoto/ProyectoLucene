I will begin by saying that the idea of making a film about the Navaho code talkers was a good idea, but the movie was just poorly made.The worst thing about this film was how unrealistic the war scenes were. Every time a grenade went off, you would see huge balls of fire. In fact this happened when anything exploded in the movie. Also the scenarios were just plain ridiculous. For instance, the scene where they are being shelled by their own artillery and they can't escape because of the Japanese. So what do they do. The rest of the company stays put while Nickolas Cage, the hero, and Adam Beach, the Navaho code talker, some how sneak around the enemies' front line and reach the enemy command post and kill the guards without no one else noticing. They then use the enemy radio at the command post to tell their artillery support that they are firing on the wrong people. They then direct the fire on the Japanese front-line, and haul ass to get out in time. Woo Hoo!!! Nickolas Cage saved the day. I don't think I have ever done something as ridiculous as that in a World War Two video game.And you are probably thinking, if the the battle scenes are over the top and unrealistic, then the acting must be too. If you are thinking that then you are right. Nickolas Cage? Christian Slater????? They do such a bad job of pretending to be a soldier that you wouldn't believe. Also the dialog is also very over the top and not delivered well by the actors.Poor directing, poor cinematography, poor special-effects, poor writing, and poor acting. Very unrealistic!!!

Released in 1971, The French Connection was groundbreaking in so many ways, and I have not found many crime movies that can match its brilliance. Director William Friedkin gave the world one of the most gritty and realistic movies in existence, and even today it proves that it can stand the test of time.The French Connection follows the experiences encountered by New York detective Jimmy Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman) and his partner Cloudy (Roy Scheider) as they track a drug ring in New York that is coming from France. Most of the movie follows these tow detectives, along with the help of federal agents, tracking chasing down people related to the drug ring, which they barely stumbled upon. It is not the plot that that really makes the movie, but, as expected, everything that moves the plot along.Acting is one of the major assets that this movie has, particularly in Gene Hackman's portrayal of Popeye Doyle. I will not hesitate in saying that I find this to be Gene Hackman's finest performance, but there is even more to the performance than that. Gene Hackman makes Doyle, in my opinion, the greatest cop in cinema history, let alone the greatest tough guy cop. Many would give this credit to Clint Eastwood's performance as Harry Callahan in the Dirty Harry series, but I disagree on that point. Popeye is crafted by Gene Hackman into a hard edged cop, who may not be the best person to exist (racism and womanizing are some of his attributes), but he holds no boundaries in solving crime, even if it means endangering innocent civilians. Hackman definitely deserved the Academy Awrd for Best Actor that he received for his performance.Almost as equally magnificent in this movie are the technical aspects. The French Connection is filmed in the same style that documentaries are filmed, giving the movie a dirty, gritty, and realistic look, feel, and sound. Streets in this movie look just as they should, with no needless effort to glamorize them. Truly, it is a spectacle to behold.Just about everything this film is meant to do is done flawlessly. No actors in the movie really deliver on the caliber that Hackman does, but that is because there is not a moment to develop their characters. Like I said, much of this movie involves chasing, not character development. Do not mistake this as a complaint, however, as I actually support the way the movie is delivered, particularly in its legendary chase scene, where Doyle is in a car chasing down an Amtrac that has a French assassin on board. As I said when I began my review, time has not done anything to dull the absolute brilliance of The French Connection.

When I saw it on Joost, I decided to finally watch it. It's younger than I expected, but overall I had a good time with it. There are a couple of things that bothered me about it, though, and here they are, hence the spoiler warning.I love science fiction and love taking an implausible idea like this and making a set of rules about it. The filmmakers had well-defined rules, I thought, about how the watch worked. And then they promptly broke them in one completely unnecessary scene. The scene I'm talking about is the DJ scene, where the kids move the DJs and make them dance. Now, according to the rules set up, the watch doesn't make the people invisible, it makes them go really fast. So if you sit there and hold a pose for what would be one second in normal time, people would be able to see you. Yet they operate the DJ's invisibly as if they were puppets (also way too fast, if they were really moving them at the speed that they were then their dance moves would be a blur); that scene had the feel to me that someone who didn't write the original screenplay decided to add to get some extra human element into the film, because everything else was so well thought out. The second thing that bothered me initially was the car chase in hypertime, but they did explain that the cars were in hypertime (and since it's a molecular level phenomenon that did end up fitting into the rules set by the filmmakers.) In spite of this, though, I do recommend it and give it a 5 out of 10 rating. Between that one scene, and kind of a lame attempt at creating family tension between the father and son, it only gets 5. But it does get 5, not 3 or 2, because it still was a fun movie.

The filmmakers had well-defined rules, I thought, about how the watch worked. And then they promptly broke them in one completely unnecessary scene. The scene I'm talking about is the DJ scene, where the kids move the DJs and make them dance. Now, according to the rules set up, the watch doesn't make the people invisible, it makes them go really fast. So if you sit there and hold a pose for what would be one second in normal time, people would be able to see you. Yet they operate the DJ's invisibly as if they were puppets (also way too fast, if they were really moving them at the speed that they were then their dance moves would be a blur); that scene had the feel to me that someone who didn't write the original screenplay decided to add to get some extra human element into the film, because everything else was so well thought out. The second thing that bothered me initially was the car chase in hypertime, but they did explain that the cars were in hypertime (and since it's a molecular level phenomenon that did end up fitting into the rules set by the filmmakers.) In spite of this, though, I do recommend it and give it a 5 out of 10 rating. Between that one scene, and kind of a lame attempt at creating family tension between the father and son, it only gets 5. But it does get 5, not 3 or 2, because it still was a fun movie.

As someone who's seen many of his films, you can almost tell he's uneasy with trying to do a simplistic alien-comes-to-Earth-needs-to-get-home story - not least of which because his evil alien movie, The Thing, was released unjustly within weeks of the 'good' alien movie ET - so he infuses it with an admiration for the conventions while also skewing them just a little for his stylistic sensibilities. The opening twenty minutes, I must say, is pretty close to perfect in its surreal and wild establishment of a premise, and not just because of Carpenter's handling of it all. The special\/visual fx are incredible, even by today's standards, as we first see a ship pass by a satellite playing Satisfaction. Then the ship crashes to Earth, and a beam of light (very intriguing, one of the best ideas in the film that is raised about life elsewhere not being in a concrete physical form upon arrival) finds its subject Scott (Jeff Bridges), who died some months early, and left a widow (Karen Allen), who sees this beam of light take shape into her dead husband, from birth until adult-form and bleating out alien language. This, followed by the inevitable push towards the plot of the alien having to reconnect with its own kind on the road, is fantastic storytelling, in how its acted by Bridges and Allen, and the immediate establishment of the themes. It's only when the plot has to go on into its predictable bits, of the government out to get the alien and it\/his 'kidnapee' with the typical out-to-get-him general (Richard Jaeckel) as well as the well-intentioned and naturally curious scientist (Charles Martin Smith, who does look cool with a cigar in tow I must say), that it starts to get tricky. There's no real feasible way to pass by this in the sort of mechanics of moving the story along, which is fine. Carpenter doesn't insult the audience too greatly in sticking to conventions, and in fact tries to compensate with some diverting humor in the 'road-trip' form. Scott\/alien Bridges is learning as he goes along, sometimes with some very specific and broad questions (Define 'love', what is fuel?), and with the mimic gags put up to a high level. It should get tired after a while, but it's one of the film's strongest and most rewarding points to see Bridges embody what is an alien entity without missing a beat. As the film goes along it should be becoming more human and like the old Scott was, yet Bridges always throws in little ticks and quirks. It's one of his best performances, strangely enough, even when he's given the position of being in a Christ-allegory late in the film.Meanwhile, Allen is game for the material too, and plays the 'straight' part with a grounded quality that gets also to the heart of the scenes. Even in a scene or two that verge on becoming much too sentimental, like the 'what is love' scene in the diner, or when she asks him to show her where the star is where he's from, she doesn't go for any corny angles- like, oddly enough, her part in Raiders of the Lost Ark she believes what she's doing every step of the way. Starman has the right cast, and the best special effects possible for the period (a silly scene with a Superman context of escaping from an exploded car not withstanding), and thankfully Carpenter is able to cull out the ideas that are bubbling under the surface of the archetypes. Like any fun 50's sci-fi effort it faithfully sticks to formula, but there are questions raised about love and compassion for the unknown. It doesn't mean that Carpenter reaches the Spielbergian levels that the script might be aspiring for, and it's a good thing it's not a repeat of a Close Encounters or ET.Quite simply, it's not exactly a great film, and not one particularly to herald as great art all the way through. However if there could possibly be any kind of 'chick flick' that the filmmaker could make, he could've done a lot worse than he did Starman, which remains more than twenty years later oddly touching and occasionally complex.

It's a massive epic motion picture that pleases your eyes and ears with effective visuality, drama, romance and more. The story tells about a Roman general Maximus who gets betrayed by an evil prince. By the acts of the prince, Maximus's family gets murdered and he wanders into sorrow where tears won't be spared. He then finds himself captured to become a gladiator among other slaves, but he still seeks for revenge. Maximus tries to keep himself alive in battles which he is forced into, only that he might someday take his revenge against the evil prince. The story has so much more in it, but I'll just leave the rest of it for the viewers, as I certainly do not want to give away any spoilers.Like I already said, the story is simply fantastic. It's so deep and touching, being very original at the same time. Despite of the movie being a massive epic one it still isn't cliché at all, it just maintains the level of drama in a level that doesn't go over the top. It has a nice flow too and there is no boring scene in any part of the movie, every scene matters and every scene is significant in its own way, that's just how incredible the storytelling is. The building of the main character, the whole theme from victorious to sad, from sad to anger and from anger to a satisfying ending, everything goes like it's supposed to. The creation of the world has been achieved terrificly well; The sets, the dressing, all the details, basically everything. Although there was a lot of CGI used in the creation of the world, the CGI department deserves a big plus on making everything so believable and realistic. Everything looks smooth and soothing, just the way you want it to look like. You can't complain, really.What comes to role performances, well, in my opinion Russell Crowe does an absolutely phenomenal role performance as Maximus. The anger, the sorrow, all the expressions and body language, just great. I don't care if Crowe is an asshole in real life, because whatever they say in the press he still is an amazing actor. He has actually become one of my favourite actors because of his past role performances, he is just everything a director wants from an actor, performing every role flawlessly. He does have that sort of a rough appearance, but he can play a nice guy too. What comes to other role performances there is one more to mention; Joaquin Phoenix. To be honest, I've never liked Phoenix that much, don't know why, but I have to admit that he is too an amazing actor. As the evil prince Commodus he is that brilliant fierce himself again, a perfect actor for an evil role.This is by far Ridley Scott's best film yet to date and when Hans Zimmer's music is put on top of the cake you just can't go wrong with that. The directing is superb and the music is magnificent. Like mentioned above the directing consists of mixtures of genres; Drama, romance, adventure and action. Every department is handled in superior way, in a way that leaves your notebook blank on the side of the faults the movie would suffer from. The music has this main theme in it, which is beautifully composed, including that beauty and also thrill and intensity. Gladiator is all in all a tremendous motion picture which everyone should see, a born legend some could say. Fantastic story, phenomenal role performance by the lead actor, superb directing and beautiful music; All this compile a film that I can't imagine to be a disappointment to anyone, a definite 9 out of 10.

The subject of that movie was of course completely different to the one here, but the artistic adaptations were in some ways very similar.The reason that I'm so conflicted about this movie is that it is visually stunning but it's also a bit of a train-wreck with most of the movie being inspired by (or stolen from) Aria, The Wall, The Silence of the Lambs, The Cook, the Thief, his Wife and her Lover, A Clockwork Orange and a whole host of other movies. I couldn't shake the question who's the kid and why is here there?. Yes yes...he's the observer giving image to text...but the vehicle just did not work for me. Sorry about that.I remember a review of Joel Schumacher's 1997 Batman & Robin, with the reviewer referring to the movie as being 'a gay Fantasia' - which was true and very, very funny. I wish the reviewer had saved that little gem for a couple of years and applied it to THIS film instead. I do not mean that as an insult or slight to anyone in my community (yes, I am a 'family' member too), but at times the overbearing swish of the Emperor and the Queen's sons were too much to take for ME and that's REALLY saying something! Consider the scene near the end of Act I - the one with Alan Cumming in the background, at the bottom of the stairs, sipping and sipping and sipping a glass of seemingly endless wine (how many times did they shoot that scene???)...his over-accentuation of flamboyance, constantly rocking back and forth and flipping his hair back distracted me from every word of the dialogue. You're IN THE BACKGROUND NOW...be still and let the other actors draw the attention...very bad direction there if you ask me. I think I might have actually been offended by the constant uber gay-ness of some of the characters...I have no explanation for that...it just bothered me. Something for my next therapy session I'm sure.Lastly, the juxtaposition of time periods EVERYWHERE with characters flashing in and out of different wardrobes every 5 milliseconds was too over the top...gave me a headache actually. Just a tiny bit of continuity here or there would really have given the film some foundation.All the negativity aside, I can't give it less than a 5. Anthony Hopkins was BRILLIANT here and he was so despite finding the creative process not only difficult but so heinous as to nearly end his career! Harry Lennix was deliciously evil and I did enjoy seeing his cum-uppance. Jessica Lange was a PERFECT Tamora. Last, but not least, Colm Feore was a tour de force. Colm caught my eye a long time ago when he played 'Legion' in Stephen King's Storm of the Century and he almost saved that wretched film Chronicles of Riddick. He's a vastly under-utilized talent and I look forward to any other projects he and Anthony Hopkins work on together. They're just wonderful actors that really compliment each other.I recommend this as leisurely viewing for couples with time on their hands. There's a LOT to talk about here. The duration, complexity and content could possibly put a damper on any kind of group setting though and this one is NOT for the kids - so keep your children safe and don't lose any friends - watch something else instead.

Consider the scene near the end of Act I - the one with Alan Cumming in the background, at the bottom of the stairs, sipping and sipping and sipping a glass of seemingly endless wine (how many times did they shoot that scene???)...his over-accentuation of flamboyance, constantly rocking back and forth and flipping his hair back distracted me from every word of the dialogue. You're IN THE BACKGROUND NOW...be still and let the other actors draw the attention...very bad direction there if you ask me. I think I might have actually been offended by the constant uber gay-ness of some of the characters...I have no explanation for that...it just bothered me. Something for my next therapy session I'm sure.Lastly, the juxtaposition of time periods EVERYWHERE with characters flashing in and out of different wardrobes every 5 milliseconds was too over the top...gave me a headache actually. Just a tiny bit of continuity here or there would really have given the film some foundation.All the negativity aside, I can't give it less than a 5. Anthony Hopkins was BRILLIANT here and he was so despite finding the creative process not only difficult but so heinous as to nearly end his career! Harry Lennix was deliciously evil and I did enjoy seeing his cum-uppance. Jessica Lange was a PERFECT Tamora. Last, but not least, Colm Feore was a tour de force. Colm caught my eye a long time ago when he played 'Legion' in Stephen King's Storm of the Century and he almost saved that wretched film Chronicles of Riddick. He's a vastly under-utilized talent and I look forward to any other projects he and Anthony Hopkins work on together.

The subject of that movie was of course completely different to the one here, but the artistic adaptations were in some ways very similar.The reason that I'm so conflicted about this movie is that it is visually stunning but it's also a bit of a train-wreck with most of the movie being inspired by (or stolen from) Aria, The Wall, The Silence of the Lambs, The Cook, the Thief, his Wife and her Lover, A Clockwork Orange and a whole host of other movies. I couldn't shake the question who's the kid and why is here there?. Yes yes...he's the observer giving image to text...but the vehicle just did not work for me. Sorry about that.I remember a review of Joel Schumacher's 1997 Batman & Robin, with the reviewer referring to the movie as being 'a gay Fantasia' - which was true and very, very funny.

This is perfectly fine, and many of the truly great films deal with people this way, it is natural because we relate more deeply with individuals. However, Stanley Kubrick's crowning achievement is one of the best-regarded films at showing humans not in an individual sense, but rather as a species.The film basically comes down to the core philosophy of evolution, about our need as a species to keep going, despite where we get ourselves. A short cut scene at the beginning of the film shows us as apes, wherein a black monolith (possible God allegory) reveals itself to us as we first begin to comprehend tools as hunting mechanisms. We proceed to separate ourselves from the apes that don't comprehend tools through harassing them and ultimately separate ourselves as unique. We then jump many years later to a theoretical 2001, wherein people have become lazy; they lack emotion and have mechanical usages for almost any regular job. What's implied is that we have evolved to a point of slothfulness due to a lack of this theoretical God. Most of the conventional story isn't the point; it is put in largely to begin the plot where the truly insightful message on human beings is revealed. An alien signal is picked up and a crew with a computer (Hal 9000) is sent to investigate. What is shown is that Hal 9000 is more human then the human beings, a creature stuck in a world void of life in a metaphysical sense. Ultimately he destroys all but one crew member in an attempt to keep things safe, through his own poorly figured sense of the situation. When the last member finally succeeds in unplugging him, he regains what it means to be human and what follows is one of the most impressive sequences ever revealed in any film.What struck me at first with 2001 was its cold lifeless nature; though this comes off as the films nature it truly is only the coldness of space that gives it the sense. 2001 is a life affirming film because it shows that humans will keep going, we are still evolving and we will never really die. I don't connect with it like some individuals, because as a believer my theology is different, but the film is a moving sense of life and color, and it is affirming in many ways to know that were not done. We as a species have a long way to go, but we will ultimately make it.2001 often lacks the philosophical qualities that make people connect with the cinema. It isn't easy relating to an abstract verb as oppose to an individual, but this quality alone separates 2001 as a truly significant piece of the cinema. Regardless as to how deeply anybody relates to the plot, the use of sound and color is unrivaled in any film, and lovers of the cinema will inherently appreciate this aspect alone. Truly nothing has ever surpassed it in terms of raw energy and beauty and any admirer of film will be impressed with this aspect regardless of philosophical merit to one's personal life.Kubrick has left us with a masterpiece I think we will all grow to further appreciate in time, just as we will further evolve, our tastes will as well, and I see further recognition ahead of 2001.

The script by James Cameron & Jay Cocks takes itself extremely seriously & tries to do a lot, perhaps too much. For a start it tries to be a murder mystery even though I guessed the killers identity fairly early on, it tries to be a dark futuristic thriller which is difficult as it's set in 1999 & the year is now 2007 & constant references to the new Millennium really date Strange days & constantly remind me that I'm watching a film & the stealing of people's memories isn't anything new & not much is done with it here & if you were a sadistic rapist & killer would you record your crimes & then send it to an ex-cop? It didn't make much sense to me. Then there's the all to obvious political message about racism & the fact that the LAPD seem to randomly shoot & kill a black man & the threat of riots as a consequence absolutely reeks of the Rodney King incident & I think I'm right in saying writer James Cameron has said the the real life Rodney King incident was a influence on the film, this aspect of the film felt forced & a bit blatant for my liking & rather predictable too & I'd imagine that the resolution of there just being two rogue cops & no widespread conspiracy throughout the department is meant to vindicate the LAPD as they were in real life. Another aspect of Strange Days that I didn't like was the near two & a half hour duration, it's just too long, too drawn out & pretty tedious at times. Having said that it's still watchable & there are some good sequences here although they tend to be few & far between.Director Bigelow conducts things at a snails pace, my patience was being severely tested by the time I had crossed the two hour mark. There's not much to shout about here, the action scenes are small in scale & provide little excitement while the violence isn't anything to write home about either, there is a potentially unpleasant rape scene here though where someone cuts a woman's clothes off with a knife & then rapes & kills her. The character's are a bit dull, the dialogue is profanity ridden & nothing special. There are some really impressive 1st person sequences which must have been a nightmare to film including a great opening scene of a robbery.With a supposed budget of about $42,000,000 & making less than $8,000,000 at the box-office Strange Days bombed big time & that isn't surprising.

Slowly it worked on me and by the end I was mesmerized.There's not really much of a plot--the caveman discover fire and different sexual positions--and there's no dialogue that we could understand but it didn't matter. The whole cast was excellent--especially Ron Perelman and Rae Dawn Chong (who had guts to do this). Their whole performances had to be done using some foreign language and body movement but they pulled it off. I heard Anthony Burgess was called in to develop the language used and coach the cast in how to use it. The cinematography is just breath-taking and the prehistoric animals look realistic all the way. I can't exactly say why I loved this movie but I did. 20th Century Fox deserves credit for actually acquiring the film and releasing it. Naturally it bombed badly here in the US but it seems I'm not the only one who likes it--when I mention it to friends I just get a blank look back. I haven't seen it since 1981 but it's never left me. Try to see it on a big screen TV. I give it an 8. ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, History"}]
