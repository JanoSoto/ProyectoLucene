Awful, awful stereotypes of people from around the world. The laughter never stops! What was meant to be the serious climax to the film is lost amid the endless guffaws at the costumes.

Out for a jog on the beach, she finds a touching love letter in a bottle to a lost love from a love struck man. When her editor prints it on the front page of the local paper it gets lots of responses including a second letter from the same man found by another reader. Partly out of professional curiosity and partly out of longing to be loved like the subject of the letters, Theresa tries to track the man down only to find him in a small fishing town on the coast &#150; widower Garret Blake. She gets to know him and the two begin to fall for one another despite his ongoing love for his dead wife, but she is aware that at some point she will have to tell him her true motives.Despite the deep feeling in my waters that this film would be a rather obvious and plodding romantic drama that is steeped in sentimentality I decided to try and give this a go and take it as I found it rather than making assumptions. Sadly, after two hours that felt like four I couldn't help feel that sometimes assumptions and prejudging a film can have some value in protecting me from stuff that just drifts along without doing anything of any great merit. Anyway &#150; by that point I had already started watching it and, wanting to give it a fair crack of the whip, stuck with it until the admittedly quite brave ending. The film is deliberately slow and lingers with an attempted depth and degree of feeling that nothing in the film actually gives it &#150; it only wants to be as touching and sensitive as the lingering shots and sappy score suggest. So we have lots of 'gentle' moments with Garret looking lovingly at Theresa or looking 'deep' or 'in pain' when talking about his dead wife or scenes of him sensitively sanding down wood in semi slow-mo while the music tinkles in the background &#150; so far so genre. My problem with it is that it totally fails to be any of these things outside of the clichés. It isn't touching, moving or even really involving.The writing is not strong enough to deal with the strong emotions that it implies it should have; certainly it asks a lot of us in accepting that these characters are who they say they are without ever letting us see them as people. The 'love' between the two lead characters happens without any real effort &#150; and Garret's occasional strops over paintings does not qualify as emotion; it just never seemed real enough &#150; like it was content to just do what the genre usually did without trying to rise above it or make a more mature, serious film. Without this core, the ending loses what should have been a terribly impacting twist &#150; instead it is merely a surprisingly brave conclusion but lacks real punch because I was never involved in the story anyway.The cast don't really manage to do anything special either, many just play along with the film's superficial sheen by looking into the distance or exchanging 'meaningful looks&#153;'. I like Costner as an actor and don't think that he deserves the sort of critical drubbing that many of his films seem to get, but here he is totally lacking in presence and charisma. He didn't strike me as a man suffering with loss that he wished wasn't loss while at the same time feeling love (and guilt?) over a new woman; he didn't have the range here to do what was required of him. Likewise, Wright Penn just seemed lost in the film &#150; just playing it all love-struck, sensitive and worthy without ever getting close to a real person. Savage is a good actor given nothing to do whatsoever and Paul Newman has so little flesh on his character's bones that it's a wonder that he doesn't just go *poof* in a cloud of dust. Coltrane's presence appears to be as much a mystery to him as it was to me. It's a real shame, because occasionally weak genre films can be lifted to be something better by a good cast who make the material better &#150; but not in this case.Overall this is a romantic, sentimental drama that will maybe satisfy those die-hard romantics who this is aimed at. For me it was far too lacking in genuine emotion and it just seemed happen to do genre clichés of loving looks, sensitive music and montages of the couple 'frolicking'. The cast has a few good names in it but they can do nothing with this material and end up just delivering rather flat performances with only the very occasional good touch. Watch it if you really like this sort of thing but I reckon that most viewers will think that this film is all at sea in the love stakes.

It isn't touching, moving or even really involving.The writing is not strong enough to deal with the strong emotions that it implies it should have; certainly it asks a lot of us in accepting that these characters are who they say they are without ever letting us see them as people. The 'love' between the two lead characters happens without any real effort &#150; and Garret's occasional strops over paintings does not qualify as emotion; it just never seemed real enough &#150; like it was content to just do what the genre usually did without trying to rise above it or make a more mature, serious film. Without this core, the ending loses what should have been a terribly impacting twist &#150; instead it is merely a surprisingly brave conclusion but lacks real punch because I was never involved in the story anyway.The cast don't really manage to do anything special either, many just play along with the film's superficial sheen by looking into the distance or exchanging 'meaningful looks&#153;'. I like Costner as an actor and don't think that he deserves the sort of critical drubbing that many of his films seem to get, but here he is totally lacking in presence and charisma. He didn't strike me as a man suffering with loss that he wished wasn't loss while at the same time feeling love (and guilt?) over a new woman; he didn't have the range here to do what was required of him. Likewise, Wright Penn just seemed lost in the film &#150; just playing it all love-struck, sensitive and worthy without ever getting close to a real person. Savage is a good actor given nothing to do whatsoever and Paul Newman has so little flesh on his character's bones that it's a wonder that he doesn't just go *poof* in a cloud of dust. Coltrane's presence appears to be as much a mystery to him as it was to me. It's a real shame, because occasionally weak genre films can be lifted to be something better by a good cast who make the material better &#150; but not in this case.Overall this is a romantic, sentimental drama that will maybe satisfy those die-hard romantics who this is aimed at. For me it was far too lacking in genuine emotion and it just seemed happen to do genre clichés of loving looks, sensitive music and montages of the couple 'frolicking'. The cast has a few good names in it but they can do nothing with this material and end up just delivering rather flat performances with only the very occasional good touch. Watch it if you really like this sort of thing but I reckon that most viewers will think that this film is all at sea in the love stakes.

Out for a jog on the beach, she finds a touching love letter in a bottle to a lost love from a love struck man. When her editor prints it on the front page of the local paper it gets lots of responses including a second letter from the same man found by another reader. Partly out of professional curiosity and partly out of longing to be loved like the subject of the letters, Theresa tries to track the man down only to find him in a small fishing town on the coast &#150; widower Garret Blake. She gets to know him and the two begin to fall for one another despite his ongoing love for his dead wife, but she is aware that at some point she will have to tell him her true motives.Despite the deep feeling in my waters that this film would be a rather obvious and plodding romantic drama that is steeped in sentimentality I decided to try and give this a go and take it as I found it rather than making assumptions. Sadly, after two hours that felt like four I couldn't help feel that sometimes assumptions and prejudging a film can have some value in protecting me from stuff that just drifts along without doing anything of any great merit. Anyway &#150; by that point I had already started watching it and, wanting to give it a fair crack of the whip, stuck with it until the admittedly quite brave ending. The film is deliberately slow and lingers with an attempted depth and degree of feeling that nothing in the film actually gives it &#150; it only wants to be as touching and sensitive as the lingering shots and sappy score suggest. So we have lots of 'gentle' moments with Garret looking lovingly at Theresa or looking 'deep' or 'in pain' when talking about his dead wife or scenes of him sensitively sanding down wood in semi slow-mo while the music tinkles in the background &#150; so far so genre.

This way he stays all the way through to adulthood regardless of what his mother tries to get him cured. Running away from home one night, Tommy finds himself in a junkyard where he finds an old pinball machine and begins to play it. When he turns out to be a natural born wizard on the pinball table it not only leads him to a cure but also causes a religious following to spring up around him.Being born in the 1970's and not really being a retro type of person, I have never gotten into The Who but I am always willing to give a film a try no matter what period it is from or what genre it is. I approached Tommy with hesitancy aware that I may not like the music and that it had a reputation for being all over the place. Well, suffice to say that the latter is certainly true and if you're coming here looking for structure or decent plotting then you'll be not only disappointed but also a touch bewildered! The basic plot is an obvious swipe at religion and, as such, I'm rather surprised this film doesn't have a legacy of Catholic protests (it may do &#150; but usually things like that stick with a film forever, like Life of Brian) following it given the amount of religious imagery in it. It doesn't totally work as it isn't clever enough to be really interesting or sharp enough to serve as a clever attack at religion. However it still manages to be great overblown fun from pretty much start to finish.Credit where credit is due, Ken Russell doesn't run the risk of being remembered as someone who suffered in moderation &#150; no, if he can have Ann Margaret rolling round on the floor then why not cover her in tinned food product? To that end his direction is relentlessly over the top and it actually helps the material because the plot and music are both over the top and revelling in 1970's excesses. It is never funny in a comedy sense but it is fun in the same way as going to a big show like Rock Horror can be, it's hard not to get caught up in the music, performances and sights of the film as everyone is really overdoing it and it's fun! Not being a fan of The Who, I was still won over by the music here &#150; like a west end show mixed with rock and served on top of sliced ham, it is catchy, overblown and enjoyable to listen to. The cast also help and all manage to deliver their lines well even if some of them are not singers as their day jobs.In fact the cast is a big part of this film working quite as well as it did &#150; their performances mostly match the overblown feel of the film. Daltry isn't a great actor but he does well here apart from the odd slip up. Ann Margaret chews the scenery with every chance and her performance is memorable (and I think was Oscar nominated &#150; but I may be wrong). Reed hams it up like a good'un and appears to be enjoying himself immensely &#150; although given the people involved in this film and the legendary habits he had I would not be surprised if it was something other than the film itself that gave him that lecherous leer! The real gold in the film though is a collection of cameos that may not all work but all add to the film Tina Turner IS The Acid Queen, Elton John gets the best song of the film, Clapton doesn't make as much of an impression as I would have liked and the presence of Jack Nicholson is as good as it is surprising!Overall this is a silly, shambolic film that makes very little sense and is not clever enough to make the points about religion that it tries to. However it is overblown, musical and fun to watch with a great collection of people from the period in small roles all through the film. It may frustrate many, which is why it is a 'cult' film as opposed to a classic hit but, for all it's flaws, I found it enjoyable and fun in a big silly OTT way!

Years later she has a fantastic son, Tommy, and is being courted by 'Uncle' Franks Hobbs. However when Tommy sees Frank and his mother killing his real father, he becomes psychosomatically deaf, dumb and blind. This way he stays all the way through to adulthood regardless of what his mother tries to get him cured. Running away from home one night, Tommy finds himself in a junkyard where he finds an old pinball machine and begins to play it. When he turns out to be a natural born wizard on the pinball table it not only leads him to a cure but also causes a religious following to spring up around him.Being born in the 1970's and not really being a retro type of person, I have never gotten into The Who but I am always willing to give a film a try no matter what period it is from or what genre it is. I approached Tommy with hesitancy aware that I may not like the music and that it had a reputation for being all over the place. Well, suffice to say that the latter is certainly true and if you're coming here looking for structure or decent plotting then you'll be not only disappointed but also a touch bewildered! The basic plot is an obvious swipe at religion and, as such, I'm rather surprised this film doesn't have a legacy of Catholic protests (it may do &#150; but usually things like that stick with a film forever, like Life of Brian) following it given the amount of religious imagery in it. It doesn't totally work as it isn't clever enough to be really interesting or sharp enough to serve as a clever attack at religion. However it still manages to be great overblown fun from pretty much start to finish.Credit where credit is due, Ken Russell doesn't run the risk of being remembered as someone who suffered in moderation &#150; no, if he can have Ann Margaret rolling round on the floor then why not cover her in tinned food product? To that end his direction is relentlessly over the top and it actually helps the material because the plot and music are both over the top and revelling in 1970's excesses. It is never funny in a comedy sense but it is fun in the same way as going to a big show like Rock Horror can be, it's hard not to get caught up in the music, performances and sights of the film as everyone is really overdoing it and it's fun! Not being a fan of The Who, I was still won over by the music here &#150; like a west end show mixed with rock and served on top of sliced ham, it is catchy, overblown and enjoyable to listen to. The cast also help and all manage to deliver their lines well even if some of them are not singers as their day jobs.In fact the cast is a big part of this film working quite as well as it did &#150; their performances mostly match the overblown feel of the film.

The original idea of the script focuses on a young singer in the 80s, leading a tribute band of one of the most famous hard rock bands of the period. He is not only playing their music to the note, but also living the life of his idols. When his friends  in the tribute band expel him, in search of some originality, the destiny plays him a good turn, and gets hired to replace the lead singer of the idols band.  A dream came true? Well, almost. While starting to live the life of the famous, including the drug and sex excesses of the rock scene of the 80s, he will also have to face the problems in relationship with his supportive girlfriend, and will be eventually need to answer questions about creativity and having a saying in the music of the band.I liked the film, one of the reasons being that it is one of the first times that the life and music of the hard metal rock bands is shown in a realistic manner. Fans of the music genre will be satisfied by the soundtrack. The overall idea is original, and the issues of how an artist lives his life and creates his art are being rendered in a sensible and balanced manner. Acting is quite good, with Mark Wahlberg better than in most of the other action flics I saw him lately, and Jennifer Aniston in tune with the nice-girl-who-knows-a-lot-about-life role. More problematic is the ending, which  is quite conventional, and may disappoint.  It looks like the main character after quiting the big and famous band has found his own creative path. However, in an  ironical twist the music he is playing in the club at the end is the worst in the whole movie! 8\/10 on my personal scale.

OK, so I was 18 months old at the time of release but still... This is, arguably, the film that kick-started the buddy-cop era. Indeed, it's influence can be seen far and wide from movies such as Red Heat (1988) to TV shows like Due South. Incidentally, whatever happened to that? I loved the music...48 Hrs lays down the template for those to follow thusly Nick Nolte plays a hard-drinking, chain-smoking, heavy swearing cop who's as popular with his superiors as he is with those he busts. After seeing two cops gunned down, he is forced to spring wise-cracking petty criminal Eddie Murphy from jail in order to catch the punk. Problem is, he has only forty-eight hours in which to crack the case before Murphy must go back inside. Nolte is as flea-bitten as they come - a sort of adult version of Columbo, right down to the rust-ridden car. Murphy, on the other hand, is just Eddie Murphy and if you've seen any of his films then you'll know what I mean. If Beverly Hills Cop makes you want to scream then try watching this first. He still does his wise-cracks, that stupid laugh of his that sounds like an asthmatic breathing through a traffic cone and occasional shouting but he does do dramatic as well, though not terribly well. Still, not bad for a stand-up.I had two big problems with this picture. Firstly, it hasn't dated well at all. Every gun seems to be a six-shooter (though they frequently fire more than six times in a round) and has the same sound effect. Same too with the fist fight scene, which sounded as convincing as Jon Voight's accent in Anaconda. The music had a horrible Eighties vibe to it but not in a good way - if Grand Theft Auto Vice City can do it, why can't the real thing? The steel drums just didn't fit at all. Second, and more disturbingly, this picture has a strong element of racism throughout. An awful lot is made about the colour of Murphy's skin with racist language, jokes and even a scene set in a southern redneck tavern. Was there any real need for this? Yes, Murphy's black and Nolte's white. So what? Can't honestly say it made me feel comfortable, even so long after the picture's release.I'm sure that at the time, 48 Hrs was an exciting and entertaining picture. The world had yet to see anything like it - though cop movies were nothing new, it took a brave film like this to show that not all cops are the clean-cut individuals we'd like them to be. It felt more realistic to audiences than, say, Bullitt and so was doubtless successful on the back of that. But now, twenty-two years later, Eddie Can I Say Dick One More Time? Murphy is lending his voice to animated kiddie's film Shrek 2 while Nolte himself fell foul of the law by driving under the influence. Actually, he looks the same in his mug-shot as he does in this film. Funny old world. As for 48 Hrs, it failed to stir my senses enough to give it a thumbs-up.

I don't think its an essential movie, and its not particularly pleasant, if that's what you're after, but if you want a good tense thriller (which many of us do), this is worth a rental. Plus, we feel for Michael Douglas and want things to turn out good for him. So in that way, i think it deserves a workmanlike 7\/10.

In fact, its all good except for the computer stuff. The firm which the film revolves around is Digicom (a bit too made-up sounding for my liking), a computer technology firm. We're told at the beginning that the firm is developing a new technology, which will be used as collateral in the upcoming merger. They develop a sort of virtual reality file-scanning system, which doesn't make file-searching any easier whatsoever, but is more like an unnecessary toy for show - but it plays a part late in the film that, for me, was my only complaint about the film. All of a sudden, we go into the machine, and it just sticks out like a sore thumb as being totally wrong for this movie - we're in a sci-fi movie all of a sudden. Plus, it was totally unnecessary. In the scene straight after, the character reports what they discovered in the machine, so it was more for show than relevance - but it ends up hurting the consistency of the film for those five minutes.This film suffers a little from the same thing the Sandra Bullock vehicle The Net suffers from - in hindsight, now that we've all just accepted the internet and computers as a helpful part of our daily existence, all these old fears we had seem slightly silly. Its a bit like looking back at those Y2K scares and thinking how ridiculous we were to be so afraid. Unlike The Net, though, technology-phobia is only in the subplot of this film. Its more about what happens between Michael Douglas and Demi Moore late one night at the office, and what happens afterwards.Its very wordy - so be prepared for that. A couple of early dialogue scenes should have been rewritten with the dialogue absent, and told with a couple of thoughtful extended shots. But maybe i only think that because i've just gotten into Antonioni. He really makes this movie look reliant on words.The sex scene is so well choreographed as to feed an entire movie's worth of plot.

Its not bad though, Swarzenegger and Belushi make quite a good pairing and the action is as good as you would expect from director Hill. Arnie and James have some funny lines and scenes together. I loved this when it first came out, but its not up to the standard of some of Arnolds other 80's films like The Terminator and Predator, it is however superior to The Running Man and Raw Deal. Arnolds dead pan delivery makes his performance as close to The Terminator as its possible to be. James Belushi is quite a good actor but seems to live in the shadow of his late, great brother John. His most famous film outwith this one is probably K-9, which actually is terrible. He is funny in a small role in Trading Places though. The action scenes are pretty over the top in Red Heat especially the opening scene where Arnie has a fight which starts in a sauna and ends up in the snow. Entertaining stuff, look out for Laurence Fishbourne of The Matrix fame in a earlyish role. ***6\/10*** ","genre":null},{"date":"27 June 2004","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Walter Hills Read Heat is quite similar to his earlier hit 48 hrs, sadly its not quite as good.

When I first saw this film I thought it was boring and dull, but over a couple of viewings I realize just how important and ground-breaking, Dr Strangelove is. What you must remember is this was made during the cold war, plus it was at it's most disturbing peak. And this film did show just how pointless war is, and with 'recent events' it makes it more ironic to watch also. Dr Strangelove is suppose to be a very black comedy and on some levels it is, but I will admit that there some scenes which I say This is suppose to be very funny but it not making me laugh. To me the humor is NOT suppose to be belly-laugh material, but humor that makes you smile for about one second. I can't praise the acting on this film enough it's on some level perhaps the best seen in any film ever made. Peter Sellers is just amazing, I mean to play three people all different in some way is quite incredible to watch and to me he SHOULD of got the Oscar for it. The main reason he so good in it that he plays these people very straight faced and very seriously, which makes it more convincing and shocking as well, and every time he's doing something you know it's going to be a classic movie moment. Don't forget that the supporting cast is just as good as Peter is George C. Scott is wonderful as this very in your face looney and keep an eye open for James Earl Jones, because he makes his screen debut also.All I can say is this is a TRUE classic and will still be for about 50 more years to come. It also has more famous movie moments than any other you can think of. And lastly is has the best written comedy screenplay in movie history.

It's primarily against it, and it shows throughout how such can be used to invade people's privacy and unlawfully be used against the common man. The film's depiction of misuse of surveillance certainly gives a disturbing insight to how it can ruin a regular Joe's life in no time, but I can't really say if said depiction is accurate or powerfully unrealistic. My knowledge of satellites and GPS isn't sufficient to determine that. The plot is very good. It moves at a good pace all the way through the film, there isn't really any point where it slows down. It's relatively easy to follow, as long as you pay attention, without being overly simplistic. The acting is decent enough, there aren't really any fantastic performances, though. The story is told with an appropriate(never too much) amount of humor that lightens an otherwise bleak and unsettling look at a world of limited privacy. The thriller parts are well-executed and exciting. The action, though there isn't much of it, is pretty good too. The ending is a pretty good climax to the film, but early in the film, I expected something very different, and, even though I've seen the film three times now, I can't really decide if I like this better than what I would have expected. The ending scene, as it is, is fairly climactic and fast-paced, but it doesn't really contain any real thriller elements. In fact, very little in the last 1\/4 consists of thriller material, which disappointed me, as everything up to that point was all thriller, and little to no action. I don't know if director Tony Scott felt that the film needed a surprise ending, if he felt that the film lacked action, or if he simply lost track of the film's style. But the last part of the movie is too action-based and contains far too few thriller elements, considering everything in the film that led up to that point, in my opinion. All in all, a good thriller with a good message that is fairly well-executed and sufficiently well-presented. I recommend it to fans of Will Smith, thrillers, and Tony Scott. Also, people who are interested in the subject might want to check it out, too. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 June 2004","score":"5 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" This film is about violation of privacy, about use and misuse of surveillance.
