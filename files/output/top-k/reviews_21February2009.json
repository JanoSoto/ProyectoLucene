Now, however, I am an adult. When I was ten, this actioner was so much fun, larger than life. And indeed, the first half is a wonderfully implausible meeting of the most entirely different worlds. We have a suburban mother and schoolteacher with a seemingly normal life in Pennsylvania. She hires sleazy, divorced urban New Jersey ex-convict private investigator Samuel L. Jackson to help her find the truth about her past. She's really an assassin for the CIA who went missing eight years ago, her true identity which emerges when she's captured and tortured by some of her old enemies. Characters are always passing through settings that are wildly unlikely places in which we would see them. A vicious one-eyed killer barges into our heroine's cookie cutter provincial home, totally ridiculous action sequences bursting out in a mall and in the picturesque country, both settings soon counterpointed by gritty, gaudy New Jersey and other urban areas.But the last half is badly paced Hollywood action contrivance, making its silliness almost unbearable. She discovers that her former boss at the CIA has allied with a psychotic ops specialist in a false flag plot to detonate a chemical bomb in downtown Niagara Falls, frame Islamic terrorists for the crime, and thus secure more funding. This doesn't sound so bad in and of itself, but take for instance the ops specialist. True to the film's spirit, he is ironically characterized as a sparkling-toothed, clean-cut young pretty boy. This could've been a novel way of making his character even more evil, but this is instead part of what pushes the movie's sideways nod at us in concurrence with its self-deprecating cash-in formula over the cliff. He find ourselves so conscious of hating him that we realize that we don't hate him because he's such an evil villain. We hate him because he does so many vile things with the obvious casting of someone who looks so incapable of being so evil. There is no way of grasping why he does what he does. Once characters like him begin to show up, Shane Black's snappy dialogue comes to feel all the more of a detachment.Nevertheless, the best thing about the movie is its often corny but vastly funny dialogue, which could fuel a whole night of stand-up routines or barroom boys' night out bickering, with razor-sharp witticisms like, You couldn't hit a lake if you were standing on the bottom, A woman's face never looks quite so beautiful as when it's distended in pain. Witness the beauty of childbirth, and The dog's been licking his anus for the last three straight hours. I should think that whatever he is attempting to dislodge is either gone for good, or there to stay. The villain surreptitiously brandishes a knife to a woman and her kids You're about to have 2.4 children. In a perilous situation, Charlie's daughter asks her if she's going to die. Charlie has an almost self-spoofing way of comforting her Oh, no, baby, no. You're not going to die. They are. Cover your ears. Hey, should we get a dog? Perhaps my favorite is during a fight in which one character has a compact razor knife. The opponent says, Oh, honey, only four inches? You'll feel me.Alas, it's the kind of movie where when a mother endures a personality change and decides she does love her little daughter when all is said and done, she cries, I LOVE HER!'' over the commotion of violence. Davis and Jackson actually outrun a flaming fireball that chases them down a corridor.One particular explosion breeds yet another in a sea of samples of the contemporary way in which action movies eliminate huge, elementary and unwarranted gaps in the laws of physics. Davis and Jackson indeed escape a flaming fireball that chases them down a tunnel. This is a convention shared by so many fellow 1990s action pictures. This one, however, does it twice. Yes, and the climax concerns, apparently, in its flurry of machine-gun-speed editing of shots that are more coverage that cinematography, a truck bomb that is to blow up a bridge, and at one point Davis in fact uses a dead body as a counterweight to lift her into the sky so she can unload on a helicopter under an archway that says Welcome to Canada.At any rate, Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson determine that they're dauntless here, as Jackson in particular always is, as they exchange their droll jeers and cheeky puns in the intervals flanked by special effects sequences. And the action is basically what we want going in extravagant, noisy and brutal. As an R-rated movie about torture, limitless body count and terrorism, the target audience is likely not boys in the fifth grade. I admired it for its unusually self-reflexive irony, which I frankly also admired in another Shane Black project from the '90s, Last Action Hero, but in order not to feel wasted by the exhaustive emptiness of it, either one has to be a fifth grade boy or someone with such a boundless sense of escapism that they've not passed over their inner fifth grade boy.

I have seen totally six different movie version of the story, and although none of them is completely bad, only one has actually been really accurate to the events of the book. Although I will always say that the 1939 Hollywood version is the absolute best, this 1956 French\/Italian film is closest to the book, as far as plot is concerned. Esmeralda does not fall in love with Gringoire, it's Claude Frollo and not his brother Jehan who lusts after Esmeralda and in the end almost all the main characters die. Yet, in a strange way, it does make some subtle differences also. Esmeralda is not young and innocent girl unaware of the reactions she causes in men. This Esmeralda is more mature, yet even she can't help but fall under Phoebus' charm. Claude Frollo is not an archdeacon, filmmakers probably still afraid of making a priest the villain. Instead he is an alchemist who has lived in the tower of Notre Dame almost his whole life. This is kind of strange since it's said in the film he is in disgrace with the church. It also diminishes bit of the conflict that happens in him when he becomes obsessed of Esmeralda. Still, I'm sure fans of Hugo can enjoy this version, if they are ready to forgive the few artistic liberties. For a film made in Europe that obviously doesn't have the big budget Hollywood could use, the sets of Notre Dame's cathedral and the 15'Th century Paris are surprisingly well done. Although the low budget does make some scenes suffer, like Quasimodo' Sanctuary! Sanctuary!- scene, Jean Delannoy's direction keeps the story going and Georges Auric's music is beautiful to listen to. However some of the English dub does bother in the film that really should have been released in French.The Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida, ones called the Most Beautiful Woman in the World, plays the more mature and sensual Esmeralda, and she makes it very clear why half the Paris is drooling after her. I was surprised to see how little makeup Anthony Quinn wears as Quasimodo, yet he completely convinces that this person has been seen as a freak his whole life. His performance is very physical, making Quasimodo seem like a beast who tries to be human, instead of Charles Laughton's poetic soul. Alain Cuny is bit too brooding as Frollo, but he does look up to part. Still, I feel screenplay didn't give him enough chances to fully explore the role. Jean Danet as Phoebus is not really anything but a jerk full of himself, but since that's how I see Phoebus I have nothing against him. Philippe Clay seems nothing like the Clopin I pictured from the book, yet there's something about his rather humorous performance that I like. Jean Tissier also makes a very subtle and slimy performance as King Louis XI, who in previous 1939 film was portrayed as a rather good guy. Robert Hirsch as Gringoire is not memorable and Maurice Sarfati as Jehan is simply annoying. Although the 1956 film is neither the best nor the finest version of the story, it does come closest to the book than any other film I've seen and is definitely worth watching. It's not a bad film, yet it could have been far better also.EDIT I recently saw original French speaking version of this film. I recommend seeing that one. Not only because they speak French so you don't have to bare the horrible English dub, but it also has scenes that were deleted from English cut and Alain Cuny shows a lot more torment and conflict as Frollo.

Alain Cuny is bit too brooding as Frollo, but he does look up to part. Still, I feel screenplay didn't give him enough chances to fully explore the role. Jean Danet as Phoebus is not really anything but a jerk full of himself, but since that's how I see Phoebus I have nothing against him. Philippe Clay seems nothing like the Clopin I pictured from the book, yet there's something about his rather humorous performance that I like. Jean Tissier also makes a very subtle and slimy performance as King Louis XI, who in previous 1939 film was portrayed as a rather good guy. Robert Hirsch as Gringoire is not memorable and Maurice Sarfati as Jehan is simply annoying. Although the 1956 film is neither the best nor the finest version of the story, it does come closest to the book than any other film I've seen and is definitely worth watching. It's not a bad film, yet it could have been far better also.EDIT I recently saw original French speaking version of this film. I recommend seeing that one. Not only because they speak French so you don't have to bare the horrible English dub, but it also has scenes that were deleted from English cut and Alain Cuny shows a lot more torment and conflict as Frollo. ","genre":"Drama, History"},{"date":"21 February 2009","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" It's no wonder that people who have been introduced to the story of the Hunchback of Notre Dame by big movie versions, like the 1939 classic or 1996 Disney animation, don't often know what really happens in Victor Hugo's classic book Notre Dame de Paris. I have seen totally six different movie version of the story, and although none of them is completely bad, only one has actually been really accurate to the events of the book. Although I will always say that the 1939 Hollywood version is the absolute best, this 1956 French\/Italian film is closest to the book, as far as plot is concerned. Esmeralda does not fall in love with Gringoire, it's Claude Frollo and not his brother Jehan who lusts after Esmeralda and in the end almost all the main characters die. Yet, in a strange way, it does make some subtle differences also. Esmeralda is not young and innocent girl unaware of the reactions she causes in men. This Esmeralda is more mature, yet even she can't help but fall under Phoebus' charm. Claude Frollo is not an archdeacon, filmmakers probably still afraid of making a priest the villain. Instead he is an alchemist who has lived in the tower of Notre Dame almost his whole life. This is kind of strange since it's said in the film he is in disgrace with the church. It also diminishes bit of the conflict that happens in him when he becomes obsessed of Esmeralda. Still, I'm sure fans of Hugo can enjoy this version, if they are ready to forgive the few artistic liberties. For a film made in Europe that obviously doesn't have the big budget Hollywood could use, the sets of Notre Dame's cathedral and the 15'Th century Paris are surprisingly well done. Although the low budget does make some scenes suffer, like Quasimodo' Sanctuary! Sanctuary!- scene, Jean Delannoy's direction keeps the story going and Georges Auric's music is beautiful to listen to.

In the same category, equally brilliant but dark-minded thrillers such as Fargo and Lone Star seldom find their audiences until they take up shelf space at your local video rental store. Most moviegoers simply don't know what they've missed because these movies don't have the giant advertising budgets of Star Wars or Jerry Maguire. Sadly, like Fargo and Lone Star, Sling Blade may suffer a similar demise. This is a real shame because these little movies deserve a better fate.Basically, if you never watched another movie in a theatre, you should see Sling Blade. This movie is that good! Comparatively, in Hollywood terms, Sling Blade crosses the goofy Tom Hanks' comedy Forrest Gump with the classic 1976 Robert De Niro psycho-chiller Taxi Driver. If your tastes run to literature, the Sling Blade plot resembles something that Southern Gothic writers such as William Faulkner and Flannery O'Conner might have cooked up.When we meet Karl Childers (Billy Bob Thornton of On Deadly Ground), he is about to be released from the state mental hospital. A retarded adult, Karl was committed when he was a child for hacking up his mother and her illicit lover with a sling blade. Our cretinous hero thought that his mama was being raped by a neighbor, when she was actually cheating on her husband. Karl has been behind bars for 25 years, so life in the free world holds little prospect for him. Although he wants to remain in the state hospital, the warden refuses to let him.Karl looks harmless enough. He wears his britches too high and his socks too low. He's a gravel-voiced, mild-mannered brute that learned to read the Bible and has a flair for fixing small motors. The warden of the state hospital, Jerry Woolridge (James Hampton of The Longest Yard) finds him work at a repair shop in a rural town that could double for Andy Griffith's Mayberry. Karl befriends a fatherless youngster, Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) and the boy's homely mother Linda Wheatley (Natalie Canerday of Biloxi Blues). She dates a drunken boyfriend, Dole Hargraves (Dwight Yoakum) who not only cheats on her but enjoys abusing her. At her son's request, Linda lets Karl bunk in their garage because Frank likes the way Karl talks. His voice, Linda observes, sounds like a race track. Karl and Linda's boyfriend Doyle don't see eye to eye. Eventually, the mean-spirited beau evicts Karl, but like Tom Hanks' retarded by savvy Forrest Gump character, Billy Bob Thornton's Karl conceals more common sense than most folks can imagine. Karl knows the vile Doyle is a snake, and Karl vows to protect young Frank and Frank's innocent mother from him.The eccentric Sling Blade cast could be refugees from TV's Hee Haw. Incredibly enough, their Southern accents sound as genuine as their performances are sincere. Karl dates a monstrous cow of a woman who constantly complains about her feet. In a role reversal, she brings Karl the bouquet of flowers. Oscar-winning actor Robert Duvall of The Godfather has a cameo has Karl's chair-ridden, good-for-nothing father who made him bury his prematurely born younger brother in a shoe box out in the backyard. Comedian John Ritter of the vintage ABC-TV sitcom Three's Company really stretches himself with an absolutely brilliant but low-key performance as Vaughan Cunningham, a bespectacled, pot-bellied homosexual. Ritter plays this difficult but outrageous role totally straight (pardon the pun), sparkling in a role that you'd never think he'd have the guts to accept. Although the other movie characters ridicule Ritter and his affair with the town mortician, the Billy Bob Thornton screenplay sympathizes with his character and shows him in a favorable light. County singer Dwight Yoakum drips pure evil as Linda's scummy boyfriend who carps on everybody for being less perfect that he is.Thornton, a gifted character actor who has appeared in minor film parts, delivers a finely tuned performance that has justifiably earned him a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Previously, Thornton played the nasty gambler in Tombstone and one of the short-lived, oil-rig villains in the Steven Seagal thriller On Deadly Ground. Not only does Thornton excel as Karl, but he also penned the script (for which he has also received an Oscar nomination) and directed this wonderfully poignant story, too. Sling Blade is a rare visual treat with several nice touches cleverly woven into the either background or the foreground and Thornton lets his cast dominate the action. The scene where the teenage drives the drunken boyfriend out of the house is so convincingly depicted that you feel like an intruder eavesdropping on the real thing.Perhaps what makes Sling Blade seem so authentic is that everything here could really happen. No special effects, no auto chases, or big action scenes clutter up this simply spun, but devastating evocative saga.

","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"21 February 2009","score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" How much money is your child worth? Is that a question you could ever fathom yourself asking? Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter broaches the subject with devastating results, showing the many ways in which one could lose their offspring and the pain and suffering it causes. But can that pain be tempered by a monetary settlement or a name being punished with a slap on the wrist? No, of course not. Vengeance will only feed your lust for blood; it will only make you go deeper and deeper into a descent towards hell. There comes a time where you must look at your life and feel rewarded for the time you've had and be able to move on, no matter how slow and painful that transition may be. This film is pretty much perfect on all counts&#151;story, acting, pacing, directing, you name it. As it went on, I couldn't help but think of David Gordon Green's film Snow Angels and the comparisons of loss and renewal as thematic backbones. Interestingly enough, both of these films were my first foray into the two director's oeuvres, both possibly their most sorrowful and heartfelt, making me want to visit the rest of their works. What the similarity also does, over ten years later, is prove Egoyan himself correct. My screening of The Sweet Hereafter was followed by a Q&A with editor Susan Shipman who spoke of how just that morning Atom told her, upon revisiting the film, that I think it holds up. He couldn't be more right; its relevance has stood the test of time.At its core, the film is about the loss of innocence, the disintegration of the parent\/child dynamic. Values had started to fall by the wayside as people began living their lives with a drive for money and power, allowing drugs and greed to destroy any semblance of compassion and morals. We've all lost our children, says Ian Holm's Mitchell Stevens, a cutthroat lawyer looking for blood by suing a manufacturing firm for a horrible accident that really had no one's fault to blame, but also a loving father who lost his hope and dream of the idyllic family. Each and every character has lost someone dear to them, whether that be the parents of the children who perished in the school bus accident at the center of it all; the driver Dolores, (wonderfully played by Gabrielle Rose), upon losing all the children of her town and surviving; or Holm with an estranged child who has been in and out of drug abuse clinics for over a decade, possibly dying or just scamming him for money any chance she gets. Love is shown in all its many forms, from a father's incestuous relationship with his daughter, to the unencumbered joy in an adopted Indigenous son, to the worrisome mother for her learning disabled child, to the father who knows he enables his daughter's drug habit, but can't stop because there may be one time when she actually isn't lying to him. Love is a gamble that you take with your heart, and through the good and bad, it can never be a mistake.What I will never forget, besides the heartbreaking instances and lingering close-ups of actors' faces mirroring the hurt they feel, (I loved the extreme framing in parts of just mouths, or even abstract compositions of a ferris wheel in the bottom left hand corner and sweeping aerial shots from a winding road to the wispy clouds in the sky), are the amazing performances. An early role for Canadian beauty Sarah Polley shows the burgeoning success she has found since, Ian Holm relays how good he is with a more challenging and rewarding role than the hailed bit part in Garden State, and Maury Chaykin, with commanding presence in a short scene, resonates both his humor and gossip yet also his sense of community in a warped way. There were also a couple of truly great turns from Tom McCamus and Bruce Greenwood. McCamus plays Polley's father with a very intriguing interior makeup. Truly loving his daughter, too much in fact with regards to their presumed sexual relationship, he always has a smile mixed with apparent awkwardness, unsure of his role in her life. Complicated to the end, it is his performing without words in two later pivotal scenes that shine most. As for Greenwood, he is by far my favorite. After losing his wife to cancer, he will do anything for his twins, even following their school bus each morning to wave at them.

Is that a question you could ever fathom yourself asking? Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter broaches the subject with devastating results, showing the many ways in which one could lose their offspring and the pain and suffering it causes. But can that pain be tempered by a monetary settlement or a name being punished with a slap on the wrist? No, of course not. Vengeance will only feed your lust for blood; it will only make you go deeper and deeper into a descent towards hell. There comes a time where you must look at your life and feel rewarded for the time you've had and be able to move on, no matter how slow and painful that transition may be. This film is pretty much perfect on all counts&#151;story, acting, pacing, directing, you name it. As it went on, I couldn't help but think of David Gordon Green's film Snow Angels and the comparisons of loss and renewal as thematic backbones. Interestingly enough, both of these films were my first foray into the two director's oeuvres, both possibly their most sorrowful and heartfelt, making me want to visit the rest of their works. What the similarity also does, over ten years later, is prove Egoyan himself correct. My screening of The Sweet Hereafter was followed by a Q&A with editor Susan Shipman who spoke of how just that morning Atom told her, upon revisiting the film, that I think it holds up. He couldn't be more right; its relevance has stood the test of time.At its core, the film is about the loss of innocence, the disintegration of the parent\/child dynamic. Values had started to fall by the wayside as people began living their lives with a drive for money and power, allowing drugs and greed to destroy any semblance of compassion and morals. We've all lost our children, says Ian Holm's Mitchell Stevens, a cutthroat lawyer looking for blood by suing a manufacturing firm for a horrible accident that really had no one's fault to blame, but also a loving father who lost his hope and dream of the idyllic family. Each and every character has lost someone dear to them, whether that be the parents of the children who perished in the school bus accident at the center of it all; the driver Dolores, (wonderfully played by Gabrielle Rose), upon losing all the children of her town and surviving; or Holm with an estranged child who has been in and out of drug abuse clinics for over a decade, possibly dying or just scamming him for money any chance she gets. Love is shown in all its many forms, from a father's incestuous relationship with his daughter, to the unencumbered joy in an adopted Indigenous son, to the worrisome mother for her learning disabled child, to the father who knows he enables his daughter's drug habit, but can't stop because there may be one time when she actually isn't lying to him. Love is a gamble that you take with your heart, and through the good and bad, it can never be a mistake.What I will never forget, besides the heartbreaking instances and lingering close-ups of actors' faces mirroring the hurt they feel, (I loved the extreme framing in parts of just mouths, or even abstract compositions of a ferris wheel in the bottom left hand corner and sweeping aerial shots from a winding road to the wispy clouds in the sky), are the amazing performances. An early role for Canadian beauty Sarah Polley shows the burgeoning success she has found since, Ian Holm relays how good he is with a more challenging and rewarding role than the hailed bit part in Garden State, and Maury Chaykin, with commanding presence in a short scene, resonates both his humor and gossip yet also his sense of community in a warped way. There were also a couple of truly great turns from Tom McCamus and Bruce Greenwood. McCamus plays Polley's father with a very intriguing interior makeup. Truly loving his daughter, too much in fact with regards to their presumed sexual relationship, he always has a smile mixed with apparent awkwardness, unsure of his role in her life. Complicated to the end, it is his performing without words in two later pivotal scenes that shine most. As for Greenwood, he is by far my favorite. After losing his wife to cancer, he will do anything for his twins, even following their school bus each morning to wave at them.

Then she meets the assistant district attorney who will handle her case, played by Kelly McGillis. McGillis is not dazzled by some of the things she learns, such as Foster's past arrest for drug possession, or her drinking on the night in question.

That's exactly how I feel right now typing this about Desperado. The first half hour of the film is great great action, great pulp dialogue scenes, great sense of style. Then out of nowhere, Rodriguez feels the need to add a cliché, predictable revenge plot line and focus the other 3\/4s of the movie about it. I felt betrayed. I wished I could turn it off, but, alas, I couldn't otherwise I couldn't be typing this. I wasted my time. I struggled hard to even stay awake.

We didn't come to see a great opening, then a boring paint-by-the-numbers plot line unravel. As stylish and cool as this movie may be, it fails understand its target audience.

At times dazzling and tragic, Francois Truffaut's bleak look at French society and juvenile delinquents is markedly different than other films of the era. While some directors were looking outward at America or making edgy films, Truffaut explores the interior life of Antoine Doinel. Antoine Doinel&#151;played by Jean-Pierre Léaud, who reprises this role in later Truffaut films&#151;is a misbehaving boy. At school, he is caught passing a lewd photo of a woman. He is without remorse, playing tricks behind the teacher's class (played by Guy Decomble from Melville's Bob le Flambeur). He is the class clown in a rigid school where any malfeasance is not tolerated. The schoolteacher pauses his lesson and says, Poor France, what a future! When he skips school one day with co-conspirator and sidekick René, he sees his mother kissing a man. This man is not her husband. She sees him, he definitely sees her, and the two scurry away. A jazzy score quickens the melancholy pace of the film, matching the mood and pulse of Paris quite nicely. It's not a stretch to assign this film social critique status. At two points in the film, teachers lead children on forced exercise walks on the streets. In pairs of two, the children break apart from the group unbeknownst to the teacher until none remain. Truffaut&#151;a rebel who created Doinel as a two parts himself one part his friends&#151;is poking fun at the establishment. The nation's future&#151;its children&#151;are rebelling against the rigidity and discipline of their elders, the teachers. It's not loud, it's not overt, but it is happening steadily. This tension between the older generation and the younger generation defined the New Wave directors and drives this film. Understandably, many critics think this film champions cause célèbre of sorts&#151;the severity with which juvenile delinquents are treated. I tend to agree. Doinel is sent away without so much as a fair seat at the table. He is mixed in with petty thieves and worse. The plot of the film is irrelevant. Doinel cannot sit still because he yearns for adventure and cheap thrills&#151;arcade, movies, 'Gravitron' ride&#151;and his truant behavior catches up with him. Eventually, he is shipped away to a reform school where he is to straighten up. Doinel is the soul of the film. He is not a bad boy. He is a real boy. Marcel Moussy and Truffaut wanted to paint a more realistic, complex portrait of a boy (with a mind, a heart, and often conflicting emotions), and they have succeeded brilliantly. He knows right from wrong. He just can't be bothered. He sets the table for dinner, then steals money. He gets a thrill out of breaking the rules. But he has a conscience&#151;he can't get the professor's harsh voice out of his head. When Doinel plays hooky, he overhears another woman talking at the bakery about an unwanted child. Doinel pauses to listen, then winces. In some ways, Doinel is the product of his parents. His mother is strict, serious, unwavering. But his father&#151;with whom we emphasize&#151;is funny, loose, and proud of Doinel. He knows Doinel stole his Michelin guide, but he would rather hope for the best than outright accuse him. Truffaut has an eye for domesticities and quotidian life. The relationship between his mother and father is similarly strained. Their marriage is so familiar, they are both weary of it. When disputes arise, we see Doinel wrapped in his sleeping blanket on his mattress, listening. The plot quickens when Doinel admits to a shrink that his mother wanted an abortion, and it was his grandmother who convinced her otherwise. The catch he made up that last bit, and ad-libbed the whole interview. This powerful scene&#151;in which Doinel is speaking actually to Truffaut because the actress wasn't available&#151;has outlived 400 Blows. He fidgets, he shrugs, he uhhs&#151;Léaud *is* Doinel. Chilling. Like other films of this era, all shots are taken at real locations. Henri Decea, the cinematographer who is as much of a staple of the New Wave as Truffaut and Godard, provides a revealing capture of a child without seeming condescending, too close, or too far. We are invited into Doinel's world like a silent co-conspirator, a witness to his every act, capture, and punishment. This film is at once marvelous and poignant. Even if you elect not to see the movie (a mistake), you must catch the last scene on YouTube. Doinel has escaped the confines of his reform school, and runs to the sea. The final shot of Doinel is as famous as the Odessa steps in Battleship Potempkin, or the snow globe from Citizen Kane according to critic Richard Neupart.

It is a dazzling ball at the Satan, the Feast during the time of plague. It is an unforgettable film, made by the master, the screen version of his own stage masterwork. It is dark, prophetic capture of divine decadence that paved the road to the most horrifying hell of unspeakable catastrophe that the world had not seen before. Bob Fosse proved in his only second directed film how talented he was in everything he was doing. Shot entirely on the location in Berlin with the Kit Kat Club cabaret of the title as a real centerpiece of the movie, Cabaret is a marvel of directing, editing, color settings, that in combination with brilliantly clever and catchy songs, creates the doomed ambiguous atmosphere of uncertainty, hanging onto the present moment, and not daring to imagine to whom tomorrow belongs and what tomorrow will bring. It is impossible to talk about Cabaret and not to mention the international cast of the young talented actors who played the characters of their own nationality. Two definite stars of the film are without doubt Liza Minnelli as Sally Bowles and Joel Grey as creepy devilish MC. For me, the film belongs to Liza Minnelli who gave performance of such energy, charisma, and exuberance, that it has become Liza's calling card and, her claim to cinematic immortality. Under her rather intimidating makeup - her eyes that took up the good half of her face, the eyelashes so long that they can reach the opposite wall of the room, the impossible garish colors of her eyelids that probably glow in darkness unmistakably announcing her presence and colored in dark green finger nails that can be considered the dangerous weapon, Sally is vulgar but vulnerable, corrupted but lovable, oblivious but lonely, talented but stuck in the cabaret Kit Kat Club where the music never stops and life is always beautiful ...In 1973, Cabaret competed for the Best Picture of the Year award with number one of 250 Best Movies as per IMDb users, Francis Coppola's Godfather. Not only it was the equal contender, it won 8 of ten Oscars it was nominated for, including Best Director for Bob Fosse, Best Actress for Liza Minnelli, Best Supporting Actor for Joel Grey (who was against three heavy weights from Godfather - Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall), and Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Cinematography. With all my love for Godfather, I believe Cabaret deserved all its awards, and as time goes it proves to be one of the best screen musicals ever made.

Ron Liebman, a union representative, comes down to a textile mill in the South and tries to organize the workers. He runs into indifference from the good folk of Shinbone or Monkey Junction or whatever it is, and hostility from the management of the plant. His first convert is Norma Rae, Sally Field, and she gradually develops an all-consuming enthusiasm, a moral calling, to get the union established. It costs her a good deal. Management attempts to buy her off by promoting her to a position in which she must check her father's work. Humiliating for him. He dies. She neglects her family -- her four kids of varying legitimacy and the guy she's living with, Beau Bridges. She was never exactly a flower of Southern womanhood but now she's become a mover and shaker and it naturally upsets people. But under Liebman's patient and humane guidance she recruits just about everyone and the union wins.Written and directed by the team that brought us Hud and Hombre, it's remarkable as much for what doesn't happen as for what does.First, though, this cleared the path through the woods for any number of later films featuring declasse floozies who fight injustice -- Erin Brokovich being an example. This is an original and gets bonus points for it.As for what it leaves out, there is a set up for an affair between the charming Liebman and the frustrated Field -- but it doesn't happen, not even when the two are swimming alone, bare-assed, in a muddy river and talking about their private lives. What a temptation THAT must have been for the writers and if they had less in the way of resolution, it would have happened.The writers also managed to neatly sidestep the temptation to turn the mill's management into a horde of rotten, filthy, violent lawbreakers. They're hostile, yes, and careless about the welfare of their employees. (The women can't leave their posts, even when they're having their periods.) However, they are not evil thugs skulking in the shadows and they don't put the nocuous Liebman in the hospital. Management violates the law only in small ways. Liebman -- who is very law-savvy -- has a legal right to post his recruiting letters on the company bulletin board but management posts them so high up that only Wilt Chamberlain on stilts could read them. The only violence, and it's brief, is when some white workers clobber a black employee under the impression that African-Americans are banding together to lead the union so they can order the white folks around.The script isn't flawless. Ron Liebman is the sophisticated Jewish New Yorker who brings enlightenment to this benighted Southern outpost of civilization. He's a paragon of normality with no weaknesses. He introduces Field to Dylan Thomas. He teaches her Yiddishisms. A stereotype. I wish we'd been able to see him in some devalued activity. Maybe he could have a collection of panties in his dresser drawer or something.And the bravura scene in which Norma Rae is fired and about to be thrown out of the deafeningly noisy mill. She leaps to a table top and holds up a printed sign reading UNION. The employees stare at her without expression. Eons seem to pass while she slowly rotates so that everyone can read the sign. Then one woman turns off her machine. Slowly, one by one, the others follow suit until finally the mill is completely and shockingly silent. A great movie moment but it jars with its lack of logic. When the final vote is taken, almost half the employees vote AGAINST the union. So where were these right-to-work people when the machines were being shut down? I've singled out these two flaws because they are buried under the multitude of virtues in the rest of the script. The story is pretty moving, and I applaud it for sticking as closely as it does to reality. When they part after their joint success, Liebman and Field don't even kiss good-bye. It's hard to imagine.

Ron Liebman, a union representative, comes down to a textile mill in the South and tries to organize the workers. He runs into indifference from the good folk of Shinbone or Monkey Junction or whatever it is, and hostility from the management of the plant. His first convert is Norma Rae, Sally Field, and she gradually develops an all-consuming enthusiasm, a moral calling, to get the union established. It costs her a good deal. Management attempts to buy her off by promoting her to a position in which she must check her father's work. Humiliating for him. He dies. She neglects her family -- her four kids of varying legitimacy and the guy she's living with, Beau Bridges. She was never exactly a flower of Southern womanhood but now she's become a mover and shaker and it naturally upsets people. But under Liebman's patient and humane guidance she recruits just about everyone and the union wins.Written and directed by the team that brought us Hud and Hombre, it's remarkable as much for what doesn't happen as for what does.First, though, this cleared the path through the woods for any number of later films featuring declasse floozies who fight injustice -- Erin Brokovich being an example. This is an original and gets bonus points for it.As for what it leaves out, there is a set up for an affair between the charming Liebman and the frustrated Field -- but it doesn't happen, not even when the two are swimming alone, bare-assed, in a muddy river and talking about their private lives. What a temptation THAT must have been for the writers and if they had less in the way of resolution, it would have happened.The writers also managed to neatly sidestep the temptation to turn the mill's management into a horde of rotten, filthy, violent lawbreakers. They're hostile, yes, and careless about the welfare of their employees. (The women can't leave their posts, even when they're having their periods.) However, they are not evil thugs skulking in the shadows and they don't put the nocuous Liebman in the hospital. Management violates the law only in small ways. Liebman -- who is very law-savvy -- has a legal right to post his recruiting letters on the company bulletin board but management posts them so high up that only Wilt Chamberlain on stilts could read them. The only violence, and it's brief, is when some white workers clobber a black employee under the impression that African-Americans are banding together to lead the union so they can order the white folks around.The script isn't flawless. Ron Liebman is the sophisticated Jewish New Yorker who brings enlightenment to this benighted Southern outpost of civilization. He's a paragon of normality with no weaknesses. He introduces Field to Dylan Thomas. He teaches her Yiddishisms. A stereotype. I wish we'd been able to see him in some devalued activity. Maybe he could have a collection of panties in his dresser drawer or something.And the bravura scene in which Norma Rae is fired and about to be thrown out of the deafeningly noisy mill. She leaps to a table top and holds up a printed sign reading UNION. The employees stare at her without expression. Eons seem to pass while she slowly rotates so that everyone can read the sign. Then one woman turns off her machine. Slowly, one by one, the others follow suit until finally the mill is completely and shockingly silent. A great movie moment but it jars with its lack of logic. When the final vote is taken, almost half the employees vote AGAINST the union. So where were these right-to-work people when the machines were being shut down? I've singled out these two flaws because they are buried under the multitude of virtues in the rest of the script. The story is pretty moving, and I applaud it for sticking as closely as it does to reality. When they part after their joint success, Liebman and Field don't even kiss good-bye. It's hard to imagine.

What follows is my fragmented, chronological lambasting of this masterpiece. The characters are cardboard cutouts with very little in terms of actual development. The opening scene begins with an argument between Hidetora and his three sons. It's almost like it assumes retroactive character maturity that was never established to begin with. It would have been nice to see some color in terms of personality, with each of these three key players given some screen time before the big fallout. In the seemingly endless line of miscalculations made on the part of our favorite masterful filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa (AK) decides to provide *his* kind of color &#150; vague one-liners. The pranks of the third son are referenced, but we get no actual development of his character (he does have one good moment later on). As for the other two sons, we don't even get AK's fuzzy caricatures. This viewer was left wholly indifferent by all of these sons, and their opaque motivations didn't help matters.Even worse is the portrayal of the vitally important fifth character. In AK's infinite stupidity, he chooses to have the key puppetmaster (Lady Kaede) simply state that her father and brothers were murdered by Hidetora and that her mother committed suicide. There is ample opportunity for a flashback (or a lengthy opening historical segment) that actually fleshes out her character while allowing the viewer to experience her sorrows directly, but AK simply settles for dull monologue by a one-dimensional personality. At one point (early in the film), she's sitting down and simply states that she's happy to be living in her old residence again. It's an utterly robotic, emotionless, tedious series of statements that are boring as hell. Only AK could portray vengeance in a manner this dull.We get the first battle and see a bunch of generic guys killing each other with no reason to care who actually wins. Some women that we don't know kill themselves along the way. There are some decent visuals though. Not bad, but not exactly scintillating.After the battle we get some of the vintage overacting that shows up in most of AK's films. Hidetora goes crazy and frolics in the grasslands. When his two buddies show up to comfort him, he stares into space, opens his mouth as wide as a Pez dispenser, and has a hissy fit while his jester runs around singing. It's a total disaster of dramaticism. But that's not all. Hidetora's buddies carry him to some random shack, only to learn that the resident just so happens to be a dude that got his eyes gauged out by Hidetora years ago. Impractical coincidence alert! So what does this blind dude do to the man who handicapped him for life? Does he curse him? Does he lunge at him with a knife? No. He plays a sad flute song. Hidetora then promptly throws *himself* through a wall. Such a masterful filmmaker, AK is.We go back to Lady Kaede, who magically goes from stoic carelessness to knife-wielding lunatic in 5 seconds flat, then takes another turn to hysterical crocodile tears only a few minutes later. Hey AK, that flashback would have been REALLY helpful. And do you know what else would have been helpful? A little relationship development between Kaede and the two sons to help the viewer in understanding exactly why these powerful men are wrapped around her little finger. You did have 160 minutes to use here. Why not use them properly for a change? Over 90 minutes in and we finally get a well-written moment when a stone fox-head is returned to Lady Kaede. Then again, even a broken clock is right twice a day. Of course, AK immediately follows this brief success with another laughable attempt at manipulation. The blind dude and his sister (who has become a target for assassination) are escorted to safety. His sister spots an old castle and tells him about it. He asks where it is. Now, any thoughtful sister would give her blind brother some idea of where this castle is. Perhaps she could take his hand and point it in the right direction. Unfortunately, this is one of those masterful Akira Kurosawa movies, so she simply blurts out Over there! The blind dude turns to the right, turns to the left, and asks Where? Some sad music accompanies this hopelessly incompetent scene where AK so blatantly reminds the viewer that &#150; yes &#150; the blind dude is, in fact, BLIND! Good ole AK wanted the viewer to feel sorry for the blind dude, so he constructs this ridiculous scene to pile it on. I laughed. The direction here is so terribly amateurish that only fanboys could possibly deny AK's clumsy incompetence.Hidetora gets amnesia and babbles senselessly. Stuff like, Who am I? and I'm lost. Such is the human condition, replies the jester. Give me a break. In a truly hilarious moment, the jester tells Hidetora to simply jump off a cliff if he's so disturbed about everything. Hidetora promptly jumps off a cliff. I laughed. Later on, Hidetora suddenly remembers that he has three sons. I'm serious.We get the final battle, which is pathetic. First of all, the blue samurai army somehow gets their hands on some semi-automatic rifles. What on earth are semi-automatic rifles doing in this period piece? Next, the editing is atrocious. The sequence is so badly cut up that one wonders if a young Paul Greengrass was hired as the action director. Third, the battle strategies suck.

A movie that takes place in one room and has no action what so ever doesn't normally spark my attention. I can't really pinpoint what it is about 12 Angry men that makes it so great, because all that this movie is is conversation between 12 men. I really got pulled into the conversation and just like the jurors the more time went by the more I went along with juror nr. 8. At the end of the movie I was even convinced that Henry's Fonda's character was right all along.However the main strength of the movie wasn't the subject of the conversation (guilty or not guilty)but the real underlying (daddy\/ son)issues. Although the movie took place in one room I really got a good impression of most of the jurors. Some were more fleshed out than others, but there were a few instances that I was really impressed by the dialog and also the acting. A scene that comes to mind is the whole racist rampage that is uttered by jury nr 10 (from a very good Ed Begley)and the reaction of the other 11 men. I also really liked juror nr. 12, a man that wants to be liked so badly but hardly dares to give his two cents and changes his verdict from guilty, to not guilty, to guilty and then Not guilty again. Also the part where Juror nr 9 talks about the old man that witnessed the murder. He talked about the witness as this was an old man that wanted attention, because he was lonely and no-one ever listened to him. You could tell by the acting of Sweeny that the witness was exactly like him. Also Lee J. Cobb (Juror nr 3) has a few very impressive scenes.

However everybody was good and at the end of this movie I was really glad I watched this masterpiece. There I said it. Not a word that I use easily when talking about movies.
