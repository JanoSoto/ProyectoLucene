It's one of the few films that generally receive annual viewings, and it's often raved as Tim Burton's best film (despite actually being directed by Henry Selick). Even if this is a case of style over substance, I couldn't help but be enchanted by this visually stunning picture, and I feel this is truly worthy of its cult classic status.Jack Skellington, the hailed leader of Halloweenland wraps up yet another successful Halloween. The entire land loves him, and though Jack receives much adoration, he feels bored with his job, and wants something different. But when Jack accidentally finds himself in Christmastown, his life regains meaning. Loving what he sees, Jack attempts to imitate the holiday, though things go terribly wrong.I have to say, The Nightmare Before Christmas was much different than I expected. While I assumed this would be a dark musical comedy, there's actually very little humor to be found. You might get a few smiles, and maybe a laugh, but The Nightmare Before Christmas is by no means a comedy. It's spellbinding fantasy, that imitates the classic Disney formula, while becoming a genre all of its own.The primary strength of this film, comes from the imagination and the visuals. The story line and setting is highly original. While only Halloweenland and Christmastown is ever seen, we are lead to believe that there's other Holiday themed world as well. It makes one wonder what could await in other lands...As far as the visuals go, this is certainly one of the best looking films I've ever seen. While never overly complex or as technically astounding as modern stopmotion films, The Nightmare Before Christmas boasts a visual style like nothing I've ever seen before. The character designs are brilliant. The landscapes are stunning. The visuals are much of what makes The Nightmare Before Christmas such a famed classic, and that's no surprise.Halloweenland and it's residents are wonderfully wicked, and often more creepy than actually scary. The slightly twisted nature to the setting here is memorable and enchanting. Christmastown recalls memories from How the Grinch Stole Christmas, while providing a much more cheery color palette.Unfortunately, Danny Elfman's songs are less than great. In general, they're forgettable and lacking in fun, and the rhyme schemes are often awkward and hard to follow. The lyrics often seem to force words to rhyme, making the songs slightly unpleasant to listen to at times. This is a shame, because there are so many songs in the film. Still, there are still several good ones, including This is Halloween, Kidnap the Sandy Claws, and the phenomenal What's This?The cast is nothing too special. Chris Sarandon voices Jack Skellington when talking, while composer and song writer Danny Elfman voices Jack when he's singing. Catherine O'Hara lends a forgettable voice for Sally, the love interest. Ken Page as Oogie Boogie is easily the standout, providing an energetic performance as the main antagonist.While Danny Elfman's songs in the film left something to be desired, his score is, quite possibly, some of his very best work. With some surprisingly jazzy segments (that sounds so much like Randy Newman's work, it's uncanny), and some great recurring musical themes and Christmas tie-ins, this is an excellent and hugely memorable score from Elfman.The main selling point may be the visuals, but that doesn't make this film worth seeing for it's other aspects. The story is very original, Elfman's score is great, and the whole production has imagination to spare. The Nightmare Before Christmas isn't as emotionally satisfying or as hilarious as the best of animated films, but the visuals alone makes this worth seeing.

It has some great performances and for sure the lives of hard core drug addicts are not played for laughs. That said, the camera work was not my cup of tea.. The quickly edited and reused bit with the locks of the door being one example. The colour was as dreary as the subject matter, which is about as dreary as it gets. I tried to watch this movie when it came out and didn't make it through, watched it years later and had a better impression (finished it), but alas it's not one of my favourite drug use movies. Drugstore Cowboy, Naked Lunch, Ed Wood (could probably think of others), for me are more enjoyable movies that demonstrate how sad the life of a drug dependent person can be. Those movies also have other stuff going on, so it's more like taking a small whiff of the outhouse stink rather than the way Requiem fully shoves your face right into the smelly feces of drug abuse. Dude loses his ARM!!! Their friendship will NOT last forever!! She is going to get ZAPPED BY ELECTRICITY!!! That brings me to the portrayal of electroshock therapy in this movie.This movie plays electroshock therapy for shock value and shock value only. If you ever meet anyone in real life who has had shock therapy or a family member who has, please don't think about this movie. Unless the movie is supposed to be taking place in the 40s or 50s, MAYBE then I could see it. But if I remember correctly this movie is supposed to be set in either the late 80s or early 90s. 1.

The lady in the movie was psychotic, they would have tried lots and lots of other things first. From what I remember they basically just wheel her in and hook her up to some electricity. 3. They give muscle relaxants so people don't spasm and jerk around, broken bones and twitching around doesn't happen. I've seen many peoples mood improve vastly with electroshock therapy and the worst thing I've seen is some STM loss (that generally returns). For most who run out of options and end up trying it their short term memories aren't ones they are going to cherish anyway. To conclude, the actress who gets electric shocks was the only redeeming thing about this movie for me. She was fantastic.

Films like this one, a satire directed at the record industry, consumerism and the capitalist system in general, tend to inspire me with a similar cynicism. I am generally suspicious of anti-materialist or anti-capitalist satire emanating from Hollywood, an institution which lives and dies by free-market principles and which is always readier to preach the virtues of thrift, frugality and glad poverty than to practise them. Whenever film-makers rail against Big Business, there is generally a good business reason for them to do so. Josie and the Pussycats started life as a strip cartoon published by Archie comics. I can't say that I'm really familiar with it, but I do recall the television cartoon from my childhood in the seventies. It was about an all-female rock band made up of three girls with contrasting hair colours and equally contrasting personalities, Josie (vocalist\/guitarist, redhead, sensible and practical), Valerie (tambourine, brunette, headstrong) and  Melody (drums, blonde, sweet- natured but a bit dumb). This film is loosely based upon the comics and the cartoons. The basic idea is that a corrupt record label, MegaRecords, is brainwashing teenagers to buy their records, and many other products as well, by putting subliminal messages under the music. If any of the musicians discover what MegaRecords are up to, they have to be disposed of. In the opening scenes we see Wyatt Frame, a MegaRecords executive, arranging for the members of Du Jour, the label's biggest boy band, to meet their deaths in a plane crash because they have started asking too many awkward questions. This, however, leaves Wyatt with a problem; MegaRecords now need a new group to replace Du Jour. In the small town of Riverdale Wyatt finds a hitherto unsuccessful girl band, the Pussycats, persuades them to accept a lucrative record deal, and propels their first single to the top of the charts. Which leaves just one question. What will happen when the Pussycats discover (and, of course, they invariably will) just what Wyatt and his boss Fiona are up to? Satire, in the cinema or in any other medium, needs something more than just a target to attack. The film never generates a lot of humour, and the characters are all pretty unmemorable. Neither Josie nor Valerie emerges as a well-defined personality. There is some attempt to make Melody a simple-minded airhead like she was in the cartoons, a characterisation owing something to popular prejudices about blondes (and possibly also to pop music's prejudices about drummers). In the cartoon, however, Melody may have been a dumb blonde, but she also had a lovable sweetness about her, something that does not really come over in Tara Reid's interpretation. Reid, in fact, struck me as miscast; she is several years older than her co-stars Rachael Leigh Cook and Rosario Dawson, and I felt that the film would have worked better with a younger Melody, playing her as a naively innocent teenager as opposed to the more worldly twenty-something Josie and Valerie. Several other characters from the cartoon, such as the Pussycats' laid- back upper-class manager Alexander, his obnoxious sister Alexandra and Josie's boyfriend Alan are imported into the film, but they all play minor supporting roles and it is clear that they are only there because fans of the original would have been disappointed had they been omitted. (And whatever happened to Alexandra's cat Sebastian?) Wyatt is a very one-dimensional character, an effete long-haired fop who speaks in the sort of fruity upper-class British accent that the British upper classes largely abandoned several decades ago. Worse, though, than the film's poor characterisation and the low standard of its humour, is its hypocrisy. Two big Hollywood giants like MGM and Universal are not really in a position to start throwing stones at the record industry or anyone else when it comes to accusations of manipulating public opinion or subliminal advertising, especially in these days when film studios and record labels are often part of the same commercial conglomerates. The blatantly obvious product placement with which the film is littered was probably intended as an ironic in- joke, but to my mind it tended to undermine the film's ostensibly anti- consumerist message. I said earlier in this review that protesting against greed, acquisitiveness and the materialism of the capitalist system is a great way to make money. Except in the case of Josie and the Pussycats it wasn't. The film actually made a loss at the box office, possibly because its target audience were more aware than the film-makers hoped of the essential contradiction in its position. Or possibly because it's just not a very good film.

Satire, in the cinema or in any other medium, needs something more than just a target to attack. The film never generates a lot of humour, and the characters are all pretty unmemorable. Neither Josie nor Valerie emerges as a well-defined personality. There is some attempt to make Melody a simple-minded airhead like she was in the cartoons, a characterisation owing something to popular prejudices about blondes (and possibly also to pop music's prejudices about drummers). In the cartoon, however, Melody may have been a dumb blonde, but she also had a lovable sweetness about her, something that does not really come over in Tara Reid's interpretation. Reid, in fact, struck me as miscast; she is several years older than her co-stars Rachael Leigh Cook and Rosario Dawson, and I felt that the film would have worked better with a younger Melody, playing her as a naively innocent teenager as opposed to the more worldly twenty-something Josie and Valerie. Several other characters from the cartoon, such as the Pussycats' laid- back upper-class manager Alexander, his obnoxious sister Alexandra and Josie's boyfriend Alan are imported into the film, but they all play minor supporting roles and it is clear that they are only there because fans of the original would have been disappointed had they been omitted. (And whatever happened to Alexandra's cat Sebastian?) Wyatt is a very one-dimensional character, an effete long-haired fop who speaks in the sort of fruity upper-class British accent that the British upper classes largely abandoned several decades ago. Worse, though, than the film's poor characterisation and the low standard of its humour, is its hypocrisy. Two big Hollywood giants like MGM and Universal are not really in a position to start throwing stones at the record industry or anyone else when it comes to accusations of manipulating public opinion or subliminal advertising, especially in these days when film studios and record labels are often part of the same commercial conglomerates. The blatantly obvious product placement with which the film is littered was probably intended as an ironic in- joke, but to my mind it tended to undermine the film's ostensibly anti- consumerist message. I said earlier in this review that protesting against greed, acquisitiveness and the materialism of the capitalist system is a great way to make money. Except in the case of Josie and the Pussycats it wasn't. The film actually made a loss at the box office, possibly because its target audience were more aware than the film-makers hoped of the essential contradiction in its position. Or possibly because it's just not a very good film. The moral of the story is not so much Don't trust what the capitalists tell you as Don't trust what anyone in the entertainment business tells you- even when they're telling you not to trust what someone else in the same business tells you! 4\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Music"},{"date":"1 May 2013","score":"","review":" Life is Beautiful Review Life is Beautiful was a story about a family and their troubles of World War II.

I saw it again last night, years later, and for the life of me couldn't figure out why I had hated it so much.Diva is a very stylish, very esoteric, very French film. So if any of those descriptions scare you, you might end up hating it. On the flip side, beware if you're a hardcore art film fan, because this movie is also a straightforward crime\/action flick. So if the phrase action flick makes you cringe, you might end up hating it also. In other words, Diva straddles the worlds of Godard (Contempt) and Michael Bay (The Transformers). And it has the potential to offend anyone who hates either extreme.The plot, based on the 1979 novel Diva by Daniel Odier, is about a young moped-riding hero who finds himself in possession of two different tapes, one wanted by criminal gangsters and the other wanted by equally vicious corporate suits. The kid himself is mostly clueless, but he is taken under the wing of a mysterious millionaire who gets involved... sort of a Bruce Wayne without the Bat outfit. The Diva in the title is an opera singer who is played and, even more impressively, *sung* by the amazing Wilhelmenia Fernandez who in real life is known for her haunting rendition of La Wally as sung in this film. She is the one whose voice ends up on a bootleg tape, which is wanted by the corporate suits, who are chasing our hero, who is also running from gangsters, who want a different tape he has.If the plot sounds tricky, perhaps comical, that's because it is. There are a lot of twists, turns, criss-crosses and surprises to keep you entertained. And while there aren't any outright punchlines and gags, there are some bits of humor and over-the-top characterizations that can only be interpreted as satirical. Example the grumpy gangster played by the awesome Dominique Pinon whose only lines seem to be I hate cops, I hate Beethoven, I hate parking decks, and so forth (stick around til the end to find out evidently the 1 thing he likes).But the real reason to enjoy this film is its artistic, stylish presentation. Directed by Jean-Jacques Beneix, this is perhaps his best example of a film style he practically defined in the 80s, known as cinéma du look. This style is characterized by non-naturalistic, self-conscious aesthetics, notably intense colors and lighting effects. For example, the millionaire's loft is drenched in vivid blues. The city chase scenes seem to have an eery, artificial red\/pink hue. And the Diva's rooms are a high-contrast, Kubrickian white.Everyone in this movie is cool. Like too-cool-for-school cool. It glorifies classical music fans, gangsters, hipsters, rich folks, poor folks, Americans, Koreans, French, kleptomaniacs, prostitutes, good guys, bad guys, and everyone except that one poor slob who works at the carnival. Everyone is cool and in control.Add to that the creative camera shots, for example lots of reflections (in the bad guys' sunglasses, or in the hubcap of a car, etc), and there you definitely have stylish.The music is artistic, but artistic in a very 80s sort of way (almost pop, a little bit cheezy at times but still cool). And of course Wilhelmenia's singing of the operatic piece from La Wally is gorgeous, and the film opens with a generous music-only scene where we can truly enjoy it.So, upon my 2nd viewing, I recommend this film. I think the only reason why I hated it at first was because I was comparing it to Beneix's 1986 masterpiece Betty Blue (37°2 le matin), which digs much deeper into poetry and character development, while sacrificing the intense plot that Diva has.I would compare Diva to the more plot-oriented films of Wim Wenders (Faraway, So Close, Until the End of the World, End of Violence) and Ridley Scott of the 80s (Black Rain, Someone to Watch Over Me ...incidentally Wilhelmenia Fernandez was also on the soundtrack of that one, singing La Wally). With Diva's exaggerated colors and large sets, I might also compare it to the visual style--visuals only--of Jean-Pierre Jeunet (City of Lost Children, Amelie), Tom Tykwer (Winter Sleepers, Run Lola Run) and the talented Japanese filmmaker Hideaki Anno (Ritual). There might even be a dash of Kieslowski (The Double Life of Veronique, Three Colors). If you like any of the films or directors I've mentioned, you should give Diva a shot. And if you hate it the first time, be sure to try it again a few years later.

It has been many years since I have seen this film, and was actually pleasantly surprised when I watched it again. Of course, you have to admit that any movie about a blue, dog-like alien with a very funny voice is going to be enjoyable regardless of the rest of the movie.This is an older animated film, still in the time period of casting little-known actors in all the roles. So as far as acting goes, there isn't too much to talk about. Daveigh Chase carries the lead role in the small, bratty, and somewhat spoiled Hawaiian girl that is Lilo. She has not done many other notable films other than playing Samantha Darko in 2001's Donnie Darko, and voicing the lead in the English version of 2001's Spirited Away. Director Chris Sanders performs the unique voice of the alien Stitch, which is one of the only noteworthy acting performances. Tia Carrere and Ving Rhames also provide supporting roles in Lilo's bossy older sister Nani, and the intimidating, ex-CIA, social worker Cobra Bubbles, respectively. In any animated film the actors are rather hard to judge how great their performances are, so unless the actors cast already have some fame, not too much can be discussed here.In an animated picture there are three jobs that essentially make the entire film the writer\/director who creates the story, the animators who make it come to life and can be the main source of comedy, and the musical scorers who can set the tone for the entire movie. Chris Sanders and Dean Deblois co-wrote and co-directed Lilo and Stitch, and of the three previously mentioned areas, this is where Lilio and Stitch slacked the most. As a whole the story was good, but looking at individual parts of the story is where it fell apart. It just appeared that they tried to cram too many good ideas into 85 minutes, which to lengthen it is difficult since the target crowd is young children. I was also particularly not fond of the film's ending, I'm not a fan of musical montages in movies at all, but to close the film in that way left me with a sour taste. The animators of the film, however, did an excellent job. Granted, having aliens as the primary characters in a film does give them a much easier job to do, but nevertheless the animation was good and succeeded in making me laugh. Composer Alan Silvestri, best know for scoring his Oscar nominated Forrest Gump and the 2012 blockbuster The Avengers, gave a very pleasant score to this film incorporating both fun original compositions and a wide range of different songs from the legendary Elvis Presley. Mixing aliens with Elvis Presley was rather bold of him, but it resulted in a success and set a sun tone for the whole film.Lilo and Stitch is a great kids movie. From the funny voices of Stitch to the hilarious action scenes between him and the other aliens, it was a great creation form all the filmmakers; because what dos a kid want to do more than laugh? This makes that very easily possible for a child. Lilo and Stitch was nominated for Best Animated Film in 2003, but lost out to Daviegh Chase's other starring film Spirited Away.I give Lilo and Stitch a brought-back-memory 7.4\/10.

Brewer subsequently wrote three sequel novels and is finishing the fourth and last sequel as I write this. (The sequels have not yet been filmed.) I had to see this film a second time just to make sure I really admired it as much as I thought I did, but my conclusions were that I admired it even more the second time around. One reason why the film works so well is that the casting of the central character, who calls himself Prot, is so perfect. No one could have done this as well as Kevin Spacey, and I doubt that he has ever done anything better in his career. Spacey combines the most ordinary looks with the quirkiest and most compelling personality. No one can chomp a whole banana, skin and all, like he does here, and retain that bland look on his face, resembling 'Mr. Nobody'. Even Mr. Bean could not pull that off. As stories go, they don't come much stranger than this. One day Prot appears in Grand Central Station, emerging from a dazzling beam of light. (And by the way, I have the original Brassai print, for those who know who Brassai was.) He claims he has arrived on a beam of light from the planet K-PAX in the constellation of Lyra, where his planet has two suns which rise simultaneously only once in 200 years. He is able to draw the complex orbit for some astrophysicists, and astounds them. But he is taken away to a lunatic asylum, as any extraterrestrial would of course have been in those innocent days before the Patriot Act, whereas today he would automatically go to Guantanamo Bay and be given a free orange suit. Jeff Bridges plays the puzzled psychiatrist ('I believe he chose me', Bridges says of Prot) who tries to work out who and what Prot is, and finds it very hard going indeed. Tests reveal that Prot can see ultra-violet light, but this is not followed up in the film. Is Prot therefore a bumble bee? Is he a spaceman? He claims to travel at five or six times the speed of light, and speaks of tachyons. (Tachyons have nothing to do with tactility, so it is OK to let your kids see this picture.) Or is Prot a human named Robert Porter, with 'Prot' being some kind of contraction of 'Porter' perhaps? In any case, he knew Robert Porter, or maybe he is Robert Porter, or maybe he is not really Robert Porter now but was then, or oh what the hell. Prot says that at 551 AM on July 27th he will return to K-PAX, as he has booked his entry time for then. He says there are no faster-than-light visitants coming and going at our planet, but that they are so common at K-PAX they would bump into each other if reservations are not made in advance. Sure enough, something bizarre happens at that moment. But what exactly it is which has happened is not really clear. The film uses hypnosis a great deal in the story, as Bridges wants to regress Prot and try and get the answers as to who he really is. (He suggests that small lead weights will make his eyelids heavy. I expect they would, too!) He suspects that Prot is really a dual-personality. For clarification on these issues it is wise to consult the book OPEN TO SUGGESTION, and also Ernest Hilgard's DIVIDED CONSCIOUSNESS. But can one be a dual-personality and still be an extraterrestrial? Now, there is a question which has not yet occurred to astro-biologists. Or does coming from a binary star system make one a binary personality? Do Prot and Porter rise and set at different times? And what has all this got to do with Sirius B? (That's a joke.) This is a roller coaster of a mystery which exists in more than three dimensions (and you can forget Minkowskian space-time too, because that's inadequate to explain anything, even if you have not 'misread your Einstein', to quote a line from the film; four dimensions simply aren't enough, and even Kaluza and Klein cannot save you.) This film should appeal to anybody who likes sci fi, to anybody who does not like sci fi, to anyone interested in extraterrestrial life, to anyone not interested in extraterrestrial life, to astro-biologists, to eggheads, to bigots (extraterrestrials must not get an amnesty and be allowed to vote!), to sceptics, to believers, indeed because the story is so very mysterious, to just about anybody with a brain, and I believe there are still a few of those left. The only weak spot in the story is the 'embittered wife' motif. Bridges has an embittered wife who is always getting at him. Admittedly, that is better than the usual embittered ex-wife who haunts all modern American movies, but it is the embittered part of it that bothers me. Are there any American wives and ex-wives who are not embittered? The film would have escaped all accusations of formula if the formulaic embittered wife had not been thrust into the story to annoy us. Surely there must be a few wives somewhere who welcome their husbands home in the evening, exhausted from work and needing some comfort, who do not immediately attack and blame and castigate them? What I am saying is is there such a thing today as a contented American wife? And if so, may we see her soon in a film, please? But putting that objection aside, this film is major mind-teaser, and long live mind-teasers! If we only had more films like this we might even remember how to think again. And just imagine what would happen to our world if we all turned our brains on instead of continuing to sleep-walk through our lives.

Making himself seem like an upstanding young man he is also heavily involved with heroin and mob like activity. Things get strange when he is asked by his mobster boss, Marsellus Wallace, to escort his wife, Mrs. Mia Wallace, while he is out of town. It seems like a recipe for disaster however not in the way one would normally think. The two did not hook up but Mia was in a deadly situation when she mistook Vince's heroin for cocaine and snorted it and overdosing. When Vince finds her he takes her to Lance's house where he normally buys his drugs and gives Mia an adrenalin shot to her heart. That situation could have been messy if they had screwed up in any way. Overall I thought this was a good movie although sometimes hard to follow.

I thought it was really cute when Annie moved to California and Alvy said that he would go over there and get her himself. I thought he was just playing around but he actually flew out to California to coerce her into coming back to New York. He even rented a car which he drove horribly, even worse than Annie. I also loved all the cool things Woody Allen did while they were filming. Like when he and Annie were standing in line to see a movie he approached the camera and started talking to audience as if they were also in the room. Also other things like when he and Annie were in bed and he wouldn't let her smoke pot before they made love and a ghost of her representing her mentality walked away and sat on a chair; he acknowledged the fact that she was not mentally there and talked to the apparition of her to represent that. It was just interesting the things he did to represent certain situations and how he made the audience feel apart of the movie and knowing his inner thoughts.

What he saw often was not pretty but always honest. Of three, Nurse Betty is the best - deliciously multi-layered, full of twists and turns, making fun of the TV obsessions and turning upside- down many genres. What is the film? A sort of a cinematic onion that reveals its layers one by one. It's a black comedy and a thriller, a road movie and a modern version of the girl Dorothy's adventures in the Wizard of Oz. It is very detailed clinical description of post- traumatic stress disorder and the parallel story of two dreamers who in the same fashion created in their imagination the ideal lovers that were so far removed from reality as Kansas from Oz. And the awakening was truly shocking. Renee Zellweger in a Golden Globe-winning performance has never been better, before or after Betty (Chicago came close). Morgan Freeman has never been as romantic and so much in love at the same time being a cold-blooded and meticulous hit-man. Greg Kinnear as a man from Betty's dreams, so handsome that a bit more and it would be a crime was perfectly cast and funny as the shallow TV star. The presence of Aaron Echhart and Crispin Glover did not hurt the film, either. But the real star is the script, so rich and unpredictable that it was pleasure following all its turns and twists. Underseen and underrated indie film that has only became better since I saw it first time soon after its release, it is a rare treat. This is a very funny and very dark film. It is dreamy, and it's one of the movies that make me happy just to know that it exists. Definitely recommended for repeat viewing. The ending is beauty itself.
