The shootout before Neo and Trinity enter the elevator is one of the most iconic action scenes in film history. We get all the fun of a lot of bullet fire, one-handed cartwheels, walking up a person's body just to kick them in the face, and a lot more fun choreography to go along with all of this.I love that this film makes ideas from Plato interesting and relevant via sci-fi motifs. There is also the notion of the one in the film. I have to admit, this motif gets somewhat annoying at times; everyone seems to say he is the one at one point or another in this film. People see it as a Christ story, but just because somebody is resurrected doesn't make them Jesus. I mean does he die for sins? There is also no clear connection to a god in this story, which goes against the ideas Christianity. I think Plato is more relevant here.What is on and off for me is my opinion on Keanu Reeves' performance. I used to think his performance in this film is terrible, but I've realized his playing dumb\/ignorant is spot-on. The scene where he questions if he should save Morpheus seems to lack some emotion, but I now realize this is one of the few instances of poor acting coming from Reeves in the film.This film would be perfect with a slightly better lead than Keanu Reeves, but this movie is still f***ing awesome.

Dorsey, seeing this as a challenge, decides to dress as a woman calling herself Dorothy Michaels and gets a job on a soap opera where he strikes up a relationship with one of the stars (Jessica Lange) on the show. As more and more pressure begins to mount, Michael must decide how to get out of the woman's outfit and reveal the truth.TOOTSIE is in my opinion one of the greatest comedies of the decade and I'd go even further and call it one of the greatest comedies ever made. There are so many wonderful things in the film and it works on so many levels that it's almost shocking when you look back at the film and see how wonderful it is. Not only does the comedy of a man dressing as a woman work but the film is more than just laughs as it hits on what it means to be an actor struggling to get work but there's also a lot of heart to the film and there's certainly many underline themes dealing with the differences between men and women.There are a lot of great things in this movie but there's no question that the true magic belongs to Hoffman who turns in one of his greatest performances. It's rather amazing to see him work here because he's basically got two different characters that share certain things but in the end they have to be separate characters. What impressed me the most was how believable he was as the female character. Not only does the supporting characters have to be able to believe he's a woman but the magic comes because when you see Hoffman as the woman, you believe it to. I think it's somewhat fitting that during the closing credits the character gets separate credits as does Hoffman. I think his performance as the woman is so great that many probably would believe that a real woman was playing her.The supporting cast is wonderful as well with Lange certainly deserving her Best Supporting Actress Oscar. She gives her character so much heart and pain that you can't help but root for her. Dabney Coleman and Charles Durning are both terrific in their roles as is Teri Garr who is downright hilarious as a somewhat psychotic friend. THen there's Pollack who is simply great as the agent. Bill Murray gives one of his greatest performances here because the story itself is quite out there yet his dry one-liners are just so hilarious that you can't help but have tears running down your face.Again, the film works perfectly as a comedy but it's so much more than that. The relationship between Dorothy and her co-worker is very believable and the various twists that happen in the plot seem real and they're never forced. The comedy comes in a very natural way and the realistic characters seem real and not something faked or made up. To me TOOTSIE is a flawless movie that manages to get funnier the more times you see it, which is something hard for a comedy to do.

But after the first half hour I started realising that this is not a prison movie, neither is it a movie about hope or friendship. The background story is irrelevant for the main point of the film and could be exchanged with any other story where someone finds himself in a place of desperation. What is the true beauty of this movie is that it comprises the wisdom of thousands of years of human history, starting with the philosophical school of the ancient Greek and Roman Stoics and Cynisists and leading to the modern work of psychologists like Viktor Frankl. The film even plainly states the message in one scene, where Andy says that the one thing they cant take away from you is the freedom of thought and the freedom to chose your attitude. The first night in prison, Andy does not utter a syllable, although everybody expects him to break down as the apparent wimp he seems to be. Andy truly lives Stoic principles, never loosing it, always ahead of everybody's games. Because he is focused, not trying to change the things he cannot change, like the sadism of the wards or the fact that he most probably never will get parole, but step by step changing the things he can, while being observant of the little tweaks and holes he can exploit to his own advantage. At the end of the movie you realise that he had a plan from day one, and with endurance and focus managed to pull through. Also he never lets go of his guiding principles, which makes him incredibly strong in such a harsh environment. Andy does not simply hope to get released one day, he does everything in his power to regain freedom, and through this attitude creates a leverage so strong that he is even able to crush his enemies in the end. At the end also Red gets it, instead of trying to manipulate the committee into giving him parole by telling them what he thinks they want to hear, he speaks of the only thing he had the power to change, his attitude towards life, and promptly gets released. The topic alone would be sufficient to propel this movie into the top ten of the best films ever made, but it is further enhanced through a captivating story and narrative, wonderful photography, and a superb acting performance of practically every actor involved. Morgan Freeman sticks out for me, because I admittedly have a weak spot for him, but that does not diminish the contribution of the rest of the cast.

This is the first of three collaborations between Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart. I doubt I have to tell anybody what the other two were since they're well-known classics.

Two immensely talented actors that never gave a bad performance (that I've seen). You always get your money and time's worth with these two. As with Stewart and Arthur, both of these gentlemen would return for future Capra classics. Aside from the four stars, we have great support from Donald Meek, Spring Byington, Samuel S.

Yes it is intended to follow on from the original 1939 classic, and one would hope to see Judy Garland once again reprise the role of Dorothy, had this unofficial sequel been made sooner and of course before Garland sadly passed (God rest her soul). Fairuza Balk however does exceptionally well as Dorothy Gale. One would wonder why, if this is a sequel, why she is younger than her original character in The Wizard Of Oz?? Surely she'd be slightly older in this one?I do like how the film has it's own intake to that completely different to the original - the chicken 'Billina' replacing the dog 'Toto'. Surely Dorothy isn't Dorothy without her dog. And a few people in these message boards think of this movie as a horror - I wouldn't say so exactly but it does have it's chilling moments - the heads in the glass cabinets and the dark dreary music during that scene... and yes The Wheelers!The Cast - All in the all, the cast are great.

It was only upon heavy recommendation from friends that I checked it out. After viewing the movie the first time, it was clear to me that, not only was it grossly misrepresented by the trailer, but this was a very special film.David Fincher's directing run thus far has proved to be a very unique, and gritty one.

It's clearly noticeable that the ONLY goal as far as the story, was for it to include as many characters and their 'in-game moves' as they could regardless of their back stories.

It's both a terrible script with god awful performances. Sets, costumes, and stunts were all pretty bad as well. The costumes make you feel like you're in a college Halloween party while the sets look like they were cheaply made at my mom's house.

I gave it 3 stars because I'm a huge fan of the game so seeing some of my favorite characters was cool (even if I had to be some form of intoxicated to enjoy it) and also, this movie helped guide me to know what NOT to have made my scorpion Halloween costume look like.

The central protagonist Paul Edgecombe (Tom Hanks), a prison guard for the Louisiana State Penitentiary for criminals on the death row, keeps things running smoothly on the Green Mile, so-named due to the scuffed green linoleum that covers the floor between the cells and the electric chair. He receives his convicted tenants with rare dignity and takes no pleasure in strapping them in to ride the lightning, seeing it instead as a sad, necessary business. Of course there's that urinary infection that makes him feel like he's pissing razorblades but Edgecomb tries to stay calm and compassionate. The ground under his feet begins to shift when John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), condemned to die by electrocution, arrives. A child-like giant, Coffey has been convicted of murdering two pre-pubescent girls in an apparently air-tight case; he was found with their bodies in his massive arms, covered in their blood. Despite his towering stature, he is a gentle man who seems to have a mysterious power much more important than physical might. Edgecomb senses the same, but only takes his own doubts to heart after Coffey displays a miraculous healing touch that cures him of his urinary infection. Soon, it is readily apparent that Coffey is no criminal. In fact, he is a miracle worker, an angel-on-earth with the power to heal and give life. This leaves Paul and the movie with a moral dilemma and throws out every preconceived notion of justice, faith, and redemption behind the barred windows.Lovingly crafted, intense and pure of spirit, Frank Darabont delivers The Green Mile as a Biblical allegory that explores the range of human kindness and cruelty as he meticulously sculpts his large cast of characters against magnificent scenery, infusing a lustrous depth to the film. Despite its varying tone, the fact that the movie still comes together as a cohesive whole is testament to Darabont's talent and dedication to spinning a cinematic story that matches the literary source.He also extracts wonderfully modulated performances from his entire cast. Tom Hanks embodies Edgecomb with a reliable decency without overselling it. The rest of the supporting cast also pitches in remarkable performances, especially Sam Rockwell as the psychotic Wild Bill, who is literally foaming at the mouth with evil and Doug Hutchison who gives a hauntingly vicious portrayal of the sadistic Percy Wetmore. But perhaps impressive of them all is Mr. Duncan as the imposing black man who despite being a dead man walking, is a Christ-like vehicle of God, capable of miracles. He puts up a deeply moving performance, showing us both Coffey's innocence and his dignity as he labors mightily to save his character from turning into a shallow stereotype, instead proving to be an unforgettable presence.The Green Mile is indeed a rousing cinematic experience with a deeply human core.

Several people seek him in the ensuing night hours a somewhat mad doctor played by Kiefer Sutherland, a detective played by William Hurt, his estranged wife played by Jennifer Connelly, a hot woman of the night played by Melissa George and a bizarre group of pale bald males in black trench coats. The story follows Murdoch as he tries to piece together reality and escape the perpetually dark city.You have to be in the mood for a movie like this because it takes place entirely on elaborate shadowy sets with CGI backgrounds, etc. The first time I tried to watch it I gave up after 20 minutes. But, if you're in the right mode, this is a cool sci-fi flick with elements of horror\/mystery and film noir. It never devolves into predictable blockbuster dreck and is thought-provoking. The revelation of the nature of the city is well done. In addition, Sewell makes for a top-rate protagonist and William Hurt is always likable. Many complain about Kiefer's offbeat performance, but the role called for it. If you don't like it blame the writers.On the female front you have Jennifer Connelly when she was still curvy and ravishing (by the early 2000s she lost too much weight and lost her sexiness). Melissa George is gorgeous in her small role as a bad girl.My interest in Dark City was spurred by Roger Ebert's exuberant accolades.

Definitely up there in my Top 10 80s movies. In fact, it's #02 on my 80s list, next to Labyrinth (1986). It's just one of those films I can watch over and over again... and have! I fell in love with Elisabeth Shue watching this movie, and I have to say that this movie is the best movie she's ever made and it's no surprise that she actually did win an award for Best Actress for this and good on here. She's amazing!I have often wondered why they named it Adventures In Babysitting in the US. Here in the UK it's called A Night On The Town which I much prefer. There's so many different Babysitting movies that can all be called Adventures In Babysitting but the UK given title for it sounds much better. THE DVD! I have to comment on the DVD artwork - it's not the best and if I'm totally honest, yes I have noticed that the clothes they are wearing on the DVD cover (especially Elisabeth Shue) are not the same as what they wear in the movie. In fact Shue doesn't ever wear a dress showing her legs but have a look on the DVD cover and you'll see different. I'm also very surprised as to why the DVD doesn't include special features. I do actually have the film on Blu-Ray now and it's the exact same as the DVD (obviously HD quality and has title music playing over the main menu which I am impressed with!) but it's a shame there's no cast interviews on this.THE SOUNDTRACK! Definitely one of the best soundtracks of the 80s and of course the opening scene to the film is just the best. Who's actually sat and watched Elisabeth Shue do the infamous dance and lip-syncing to The Crystals Then He Kissed Me Great opening to a movie, it's awesome and she's just stunning. This film really did make her career. I'm not sure if there has been an official soundtrack release for this movie but there should be. Every song featured throughout the movie is just classic, quality stuff.It's great to see Shue and the gang singing in the Blues club, some great words to the Babysitting Blues song and you can actually believe that Shue made the song up on the spot considering she gets forced to sing her way out of the club! Brilliant stuff!I thoroughly enjoy towards the end of the movie during the Edwin Starr 25 Miles scene where they are rushing home. Again watch out for Elisabeth Shue fly jump over the couch and perfectly into place pretending she's been sat there the whole night. If I'm spoiling any moments here for those that haven't seen it, I do apologise, it's just hard not to mention the best parts of this movie. The rest of the cast are great, and congratulations to Maia Brewton on winning an award for Best Young Actress - an award well deserved. Also, I hate to break it to you, but unfortunately there is going to be a remake due in 2016 by Disney! I for one will most likely not give it a chance, you know what they say You don't f**k with the original just like you don't f**k with the babysitter! A terrific cast... a terrific film... a terrific babysitting night. Definitely a 10\/10!! ","genre":null},{"date":"29 April 2015","score":"","review":" Absolute classic 80's film! Definitely up there in my Top 10 80s movies. In fact, it's #02 on my 80s list, next to Labyrinth (1986). It's just one of those films I can watch over and over again... and have! I fell in love with Elisabeth Shue watching this movie, and I have to say that this movie is the best movie she's ever made and it's no surprise that she actually did win an award for Best Actress for this and good on here. She's amazing!I have often wondered why they named it Adventures In Babysitting in the US. Here in the UK it's called A Night On The Town which I much prefer. There's so many different Babysitting movies that can all be called Adventures In Babysitting but the UK given title for it sounds much better. THE DVD! I have to comment on the DVD artwork - it's not the best and if I'm totally honest, yes I have noticed that the clothes they are wearing on the DVD cover (especially Elisabeth Shue) are not the same as what they wear in the movie. In fact Shue doesn't ever wear a dress showing her legs but have a look on the DVD cover and you'll see different. I'm also very surprised as to why the DVD doesn't include special features. I do actually have the film on Blu-Ray now and it's the exact same as the DVD (obviously HD quality and has title music playing over the main menu which I am impressed with!) but it's a shame there's no cast interviews on this.THE SOUNDTRACK! Definitely one of the best soundtracks of the 80s and of course the opening scene to the film is just the best.

After watching it one time, I was able to quote some of the lines, too. The Characters are so dynamic. They fit well into any high school whether it be in the 80's or the present day. There is not one character in the movie that a person cannot relate, too. I find it neat how the movie has a very basic setting. Most of the movie is in the library. There are the few scenes where they aren't but most of it they remain the one spot. I think the best scene is when they all start whistling. It is such a simple beginning to a scene and brings more humor to the movie. The change in the characters through the movie is a drastic change. They start as students who don't know each other or even care about one another. Then in the end, they all talk about one another. They learn things about the other people that if they hadn't been stuck in detention together, they would never know about each other. It is how people in school still interact with one another. You never really know your fellow student until you are sitting next to them in class, or stuck with them for a project or in detention. The movie accurately portrays high school students in a timeless way. ","genre":null},{"date":"29 April 2015","score":"","review":" I first watched this movie with my friend and her dad.

We saw this film because we had the opportunity to meet Richard Lester, the film director, who was invited to the Festival. I volunteered to interview him, so we could ask him some questions. The Beatles act in this movie, which was released in 1965. The story is a comedy, there are funny moments! Even if it is comical, the story is completely nonsense. It is about the Beatles, wanted by an Indian cult because Ringo is wearing their sacrificial ring, and can not take it off. The Beatles are pursued all around the world by the cult, but on top of that by an inspector, two scientists and another person too! The four members have each a different personal trait, for example, Ringo thinks he is always a victim, he thinks people pick on him all the time.Very funny, the Beatles appear relaxed and the actor's game is good if we consider they are not actors but singers in the first place! Good singers, by the way, the sound track of the movie is very good! This is what I preferred in the film. It could be a good reason to watch this movie. I recommend it, but wait until it comes out on video! It is a good movie, very funny, but a bit long though, because of the meaninglessness of the storyline.
