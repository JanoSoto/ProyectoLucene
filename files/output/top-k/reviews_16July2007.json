[{"date":"16 July 2007","score":"7 out of 15 people found the following review useful","review":" On the 1998 summer blockbuster hit BASEketball (1998) This is one of those movies that is usually seen on the big jumbo-tron screen in a sports bar during the day - when everyone is quite drunk. Unfortunately, I was sober when I saw this movie.So quoted the late Gene Siskel for this lame-brained, supposed yukfest that came out two weeks after the far superior There's Something About Mary in a one-upmanship game during July of 1998. Mary was a gross-out fest, but in addition to the many gags, it had a lot of heart, which is why it was the highest grossing comedy of that memorable summer.BASEketball tried to outdo Mary, but it fizzled in more ways that one. You take the creators of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who are fortunately not behind the movie but in front of the camera, the only member of ZAZ David Zucker helming the picture in desperate need of a paycheck, and the other two Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker clearly stayed out or probably warned him against the picture, a small bit by now 90 years young Ernest Borgnine, wasting his precious time in his distinguished career, dying on a hotdog and singing I'm Too Sexy as he videotapes his will, Jenny McCarthy, who has little screen time as Borgnine's not-too-weeping trophy widow young enough to be his granddaughter, a bigger female part by Yasmine Bleeth as a dedicated social worker whose charges are underprivileged youngsters, and the only interesting and meaningful player in this turkey, Robert Vaughn as a corrupt archrival, and pointless cameos by Airplane! alumni Kareem Abdul Jabaar and the late Robert Stack who seemed nostalgic for the 1980 masterpiece and it's much fresher humor created by the ZAZ family. What do all these people make up? A desperate cast and crew trying to replicate Airplane! humor and mixing it up with the crudity of South Park, but failing in every way.To make this long 100-minute movie short, BASEketball, a real game invented by David Zucker and his friends in his hometown of Milwaukee, is about two lazy losers (Parker and Stone) and their pint-sized mutual friend who invent baseball and basketball (hence the title) together on the driveway of one's house. After Borgnine dies, he bequeaths the ownership of his BASEketball team, the Milwaukee Beers to Parker and Stone. Sure enough, the game goes national, and archrivals Vaughn and McCarthy want to take away ownership of the Beers team from them. But Bleeth is in love with both men, particularly Parker, and one poor, sick charge in need of a liver transplant goes ga-ga over them. Those are the characters, not strongly developed.Now witless gags ensue. Blood, electroshock hair, egg-throwing and screaming are among them. Parker and Stone nearly kill the youngster in the hospital, but he pulls through the liver transplant. Borgnine sings and rubs ointment on his chest in the videotaped will. McCarthy, who seemed to get over Borgnine's death by choking on a frank right away, quickly massages Vaughn in the next scene. Cheerleaders dance in skimpy outfits. There is plenty of music on the soundtrack that is played for the hard of hearing. And David Zucker forces the parodies of Riverdance and Titanic. Parody forcing is nothing new to ZAZ, post Airplane! and The Naked Gun series.And like Siskel, I was sober as well, but I was also getting sleepy. This movie should be played over and over to coarse-mannered barroom patrons who enjoy it as they chug down beers, but will they remain alert and awake, or pass out during the unfunny parts? If they pass out, then they won't realize that they are luckily missing stupidity and absurdity. Hats off to them!

The movie opens with him confessing all his problems to a calm, gambling person called Burmeister, played by Michael Douglas. Randy meets a beautiful woman - Jewel, played by Liv Tyler, who puts him into a lot of trouble, involving a murder and plenty of robberies.One Night at McCool's has that typical comedy style, quickly unfolding the story, mixing it with characters who act unnatural, but after all, you still laugh at times, gaining respect for all those good actors, seeking for some genre variety.Matt Dillon's comic performance is quite successful. I never thought he could be funny again after There's Something About Mary, but it turned out he could. He recreates his character with a lot of enthusiasm. As a matter of fact, he might very well be considered the highlight of the movie. There are a couple of hilarious scenes with him. The way he utters his lines is great. There is that moment when a thief enters Randy's place and forces him to hand over the car keys and Dillon's character responds I don't have a car. The reaction of the thief, and the whole moment of spoiling the little seriousness is just hilarious.The plot is more of a self-parody than witty and creative. Paul Reiser, for example, plays the most eccentric character in the whole movie. He is Randy's cousin. His character is given present day story all the way from the third act. Before that, there is a spread segment of him, having a hilarious dialog with a shrink. Reiser is very funny in this one. A good cast decision.Aside from all those positive things, One Night at McCool's is far from being a flawless comedy. The second act is rather boring and unfunny. Sex jokes repeat one after another in different context. I definitely hated the John Goodman's character - a cop who falls for Jewel and threatens Randy with jail as being the prime suspect for a murder. Michael Douglas, another surprising cast choice for such film, also doesn't fit in the whole story. His character has very few lines until the third act, which is ridiculous for an actor of such magnitude.One Night at McCool's is great entertainment, but be sure you're not watching it for the cast. Dillon and Reiser are very fresh, but Douglas and Goodman are offensively unfunny. If you think you've never seen them in bad roles, avoid this flick. If you need a good laugh, One Night at McCool's is the right choice.

The War is set in the summer of 1970 in Mississippi. Steven Simmons (Kevin Costner) has recently returned from Vietnam and is trying to fit back into life as he once knew it. However his time in Vietnam has left its scars (both physically and emotionally), and has placed strain on his relationship with wife Lois (Mare Winningham), and his children Lydia (Lexi Randall) and Stu (Elijah Wood), who are 12 year old twins. While Steven is trying to re-build his own life, Stu and Lydia are spending the summer building a tree house with the help of their friends, while trying to avoid the Lipnicki children, who take on the local bullies role. The acting by most is natural and convincing. Elijah Wood's portrayal of the intense but likable Stu is very well done. Kevin Costner, in what must be one of his best (yet lesser known) roles, is very understated and brilliantly cast as Steve. Lexi Randall, as Lydia, also shines at times, although she is almost overshadowed by the wonderful performance of her best friend Elvadine, played by Latoya Chisholm This movie has a similar feel to that of Fried Green Tomatoes (both films are directed by Jon AvnetPicture The overall picture quality of this HD DVD is very good. For the most part the image is sharp and the colours are vibrant. The lush greens of the forest and the bright blue sky in some scenes look fantastic. There are some close-up shots of the actors' faces that are so detailed I just said 'wow' out loud when I saw them, and the scenes filmed in the forest display an incredible depth. At times this transfer looks brilliant - almost on par with the best looking HD DVD titles out thereThere is some noticeable grain in night scenes and some sequences filmed indoors. There is also the odd occasion where the picture looks slightly soft and out of focus, and while contrast is fine in daylight scenes, blacks tend to look more dark grey at night.Being very impressed with the overall picture quality of this HD DVD, I dusted off the DVD version and gave it a spin for comparison's sake. The difference between the two is so great, I now find the DVD unwatchable. You do not realise just how much better the remastered HD DVD looks until you compare it with the original DVD transfer. From the first 30 seconds of this movie, as the camera pans around a large oak tree that is to become a central part of the movie, the difference between the two formats is like chalk and cheese. The DVD looks dark and out of focus, colours are muted and you struggle to make out any finer details of the tree and its surroundings. There is also constant and irritating grain. In comparison, the detail of the tree's twisting branches and bark on HD DVD is much more evident. After comparing the remastered HD DVD to the DVD, this has to be the greatest improvement I have seen when comparing the two formats and the same movie. Hats off to Universal! Audio First up, I was surprised when The War was announced on HD DVD by Universal, and even more surprised to learn that it would come packaged with a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack.This movie is primarily dialogue driven, therefore the majority of the soundtrack comes out of the front three speakers. However the rear speakers are employed almost constantly in a subtle way for most of the movie. You are constantly aware of the chatter of insects buzzing through all speakers &#150; typical of what you would experience in the Deep South in the middle of summer. It is a wonderfully immersive mix that draws you in to what is happening on-screen There are some loud and impressive sections in this soundtrack where all speakers are used to great effect. Flashbacks to the Vietnam War, and scenes at a water tower and marble mine are the audio highlights of the movie. These scenes are mixed at a high volume in comparison to the rest of the soundtrack, adding to their impact. Bass is strong and tight without becoming overpowering. Sure, the discrete sound effects are not as convincing as those on well recorded and recently released action movie, but once again it is an impressive mix for a 13 year old movie The War soundtrack includes a mix of classic songs from the 1960s and 1970s (Cat Stevens, Credence, The Supremes, Aretha Franklin), and also boasts and interesting and varied score that is especially moving in some scenes. In comparison to the DVD (which contains a 5.1 Dolby Digital track), the HD DVD Dolby TrueHD and Dolby Digital Plus soundtrack is a noticeable step up in quality, but not as great as the improvement in picture. The DVD soundtrack is actually not that bad to begin with (and is mixed about 4dB higher than the HD DVD), but the HD DVD version is more immersive during the quieter scenes, and definitely more powerful during the action sequences. The difference between the Dolby Digital Plus and TrueHD mixes are slight, with ambient noises and dialogue sounding clearer on the TrueHD mix. Summary Being familiar with The War already, it was a real treat to see a movie I enjoy viewing so much being resurrected to look and sound this good. If you want to see just how good 13 year old catalogue title can scrub up, pick up a copy of this HD DVD.

I can't believe I used those 4 words together in the same phrase, but this truly wraps up what this movie is like. An insect biologist(I think), played by Julian Sands, discovers a new breed of spider in South America which kills a photographer and the spider hitches a ride in his coffin back to his hometown and wreaks havoc there. The guy that discovers the existence first ( a medical doctor played by Jeff Daniels), is afraid of spiders(aka. Arachnaphobia) because of an early childhood incident but quickly has to get over it as he is right in the middle of a spider epidemic. Daniel's plays his character with just enough dry wit to pull off the role and Sands is competent as the original discoverer. He becomes involved with Daniel's character and the town after a few deaths appear to be from spider bites. John Goodman plays an exterminator and provides the comic relief. This movie is very well done as far as mixing the horror aspect(making the spiders a real menace), some comedy, and not grossing us out so we'll turn away from the screen and miss the important parts of the story and characters. It does turn a bit Rambo-like near the end as Daniel's character seems to forget that he has Arachnophobia(which isn't explored very well incidentally) but overall the movie is a worthwhile and unusually entertaining venture which doesn't end with the usual expectation of a sequel(which I'm glad for). The ending is funny and very unique, but I won't give it away, just watch this movie and enjoy it...even if you don't like spiders ( I don't, but enjoyed the movie).

Cameron Crowe writes the screenplay and directs this americanized version. Vanilla Sky provides an A-list cast including Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz,Cameron Diaz, Jason Lee, and Kurt Russell. The movie details a series of very strange events in the life of thirty-something, spoiled publishing tycoon David Aames, played by Tom Cruise. Brian Shelby,played by actor Jason Lee, is his best friend and a source of reason and wisdom for David. Juliana Gianni, played by Cameron Diaz, becomes very jealous and possessive of David after he blows off their casual sexual relationship to pursue the romantic affections of Sophia Serrano, played by actress Penelope Cruz. Through these events David Aames begins to realize that something is wrong with the world and finds out he is only too right but in a way so strange and surprising that it challenges the imagination. Cameron Crowe makes excellent use of dialog, symbolism, and structure to support the film's key concepts and themes. He also makes use of them by hiding clues to the overall mystery throughout the film in the dialog and in visual symbolism. Crowe presents many valid points through the themes and concepts concerning the importance of dreams, desires, and the human mind.The use of dialog and symbolism to reveal subtle clues to the viewer can be found throughout Vanilla Sky. Throughout the entire film people keep telling David to wake up or open his eyes, inferring the he is sleeping or not really awake. Aames refers to his company's board members as the seven dwarfs which would make him Snow White who fell into a deep sleep after eating a poison apple in the children's story Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. This becomes more relevant later when it is revealed that David overdoses on his medications in order to end his real life so that he may begin his lucid dream in cryo-stasis. In one scene Sophia asks David if this is all a dream and he replies absolutely though they mean in reference to the state of post-relations bliss they are both enjoying at the time. The psychologist character, played by Kurt Russell, asks David during his interview if he knows the difference between dreams and reality. Several clues lie hidden within the visuals of the film and are symbols of their hidden meanings. The Monet painting in Aames' apartment is called Vanilla Sky, and after the night David passes out in the street the real sky itself becomes like that of the painting signifying where the lucid dream begins. Many times in the film Life Exstension, cryogenics, and a thawed out dog named Benny are either discussed directly by the characters or by others on televisions being watched by the characters, this is David's sub-conscious piecing together memories supposedly erased by the Life Exstension process. In this way Crowe shows how David's memories of his former real life begin to bleed through becoming mixed with those created solely within the lucid dream. Crowe uses these devices to give the viewer subliminal glimpses of the true nature of the plot.There are many themes and key concepts in regard to life, dreams, and the human mind in this film. Two of the more prominent re-occurring lines in Vanilla Sky are the sweet is never as sweet without the sour and every minute that passes is a chance to turn it all around. The first phrase is a piece of sage advice given to David by his friend Brian on several different occasions. The writer may be making an assertion to life in general, but also regarding the relationship between the waking world and that of dreams. Perhaps Crowe wishes to express that dreams are a form of escapism for us from the harsh real world. The second phrase is repeated throughout the film to David by several people. It can also be seen as a generic statement about life and taking advantage of second chances, but more specifically it is advice given to David when he begins to despair or become afraid of the chaos, confusion, and insanity he is experiencing. This is meant as a trigger to remind his sub-conscious that he can call for help from tech support at any moment. The phrase in the dialog, the sub-conscious is a powerful thing, can be considered the central concept for the film as a whole. Within the film it answers the how question of what is really happening to David Aames. Externally the film uses similar techniques, playing on the sub-conscious of the viewer by subtly manipulating the style and structure in coherence with the themes of the story.Cameron Crowe takes advantage of his role as the director and screenplay adapter by incorporating into the film's style and structure key elements to the conceptual nature of the film itself. The film's style was somewhat surreal with the colors being more vibrant after the lucid dream splice had taken place. The structure and flow of the film is helpful in projecting the feeling of dreams. Much like a lot of real dreams the story jumps around within the plot's time line but keeps an overall forward motion. Also, like in dreams, there are instances of lines that do not fit or make sense in the context that they are spoken. Many of these random lines are meant to be clues, such as this is a revolution of the mind, spoken randomly to David by a man he passes by in the hall of the police station. This is reminiscent of how dialog in dreams doesn't always make sense in the context of the dreams themselves. Crowe uses these types of techniques to make the movie experience that much more psychologically interactive for the viewer; to truly transport them into the world of Vanilla Sky, a world of dreams.

Steven Spielberg is renowned for his special effects-laden blockbusters, but even more so for his World War II epics that are meant more to inform and remember rather than to entertain. His most accomplished film is Schindler's List, based on the true story of a man who saved over a thousand Jews from extermination. Those renting the DVD just to have a fun time would be best to look elsewhere. Those who are looking to view a perfect take on a very depressing time in European history will find it in Schindler's List. This is not Oscar bait, like so many people claim it to be. This is a upsetting and heart-wrenching motion picture that is sure to bring some people to tears. With an excellent cast, a beautiful score and harrowing camera-work, Schindler's List succeeds on so many levels.Set in Poland during World War II, the film centers on Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a member of the Nazi Party who wishes to open a pots and pans factory in Krakow. Due to Jewish workers being much cheaper than Poles, he hires an accountant called Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help roll up Jews to work in the factory. Soon, more and more of them are hired and while Schindler originally saved the Jews for profit, now he wants to save them from being gassed in the concentration camps. Meanwhile, Schindler meets Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), a Nazi soldier who takes pleasure in shooting Jews. However, he also has a relationship with Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz), a Jewish woman who is sometimes abused, but also sometimes loved by Goeth. These two stories are also connected with those of the prisoners in the Ghettos and concentration camps, who are hired and saved by Schindler.The images of Schindler's List are very depressing and upsetting, but it could not have worked any other way. Spielberg portrays Nazi-occupied Poland accurately and thus, it's quite possibly one of the saddest films ever made. It's not an easy film to watch, but it should certainly be mandatory viewing. Schindler's List is not just a movie, it's a call for an end to prejudice. The Holocaust was one of the most horrific events of the twentieth century and it is perfectly filmed by director of photography Janusz Kaminski. The majority of the film is in black-and-white, a very intelligent decision on Spielberg's part, which actually makes the film look more realistic than if it was entirely in colour. Many scenes, including one involving a jammed gun, make us stop and think that maybe we shouldn't take things for granted. Steven Zaillian's screenplay is tight and manages to portray these real-life people very well with excellent dialogue. In addition, John Williams' score adds even more heartbreak to this tremendous film.Yet, it is the actors who truly sell the film. Liam Neeson shows plenty of range as a man, who starts off as greedy and only looking for profit and then slowly changes into a hero. Schindler is a man who wants to make money, but also wants to save lives and Neeson perfectly shows a man who can't have his cake and eat it, too. Ben Kingsley gives very subtle work as Stern, a man who is in two worlds that of the ghettos and concentration camps and then working alongside a man who can save his fellow Jews. While Schindler is giving him instructions, we see that Stern is secretly pulling the strings as much as he can. Finally, Ralph Fiennes truly shows that he is one of Britain's finest young actors with his role as the ruthless Goeth. We see in his eyes a man who is not just following orders like some Nazis were at the time, but really somebody who does believe a lot in Der Führer's evil ideas. Fiennes portrays his love for Hirsch very well, showing him at a crossroads. On the one hand, he hates Jews and believes them to be scum, but on the other, he has a deep admiration for Helen. Yet, he feels he must show his meaner side to the follow soldiers. Fiennes not only shows an evil man, but a man truly in love as well.Steven Spielberg is the master behind this brilliant production and everything about it is composed so well. He proved with this film that he has the ability to direct serious, dramatic films and this is the film that most people will view him upon. It is the story of triumph and how if you try, you can help save the world and lead to the end of racism and violence. After all, as the Talmud says, Whoever saves one life saves the world entire. This quote can be applied to people of all religions, not just those who Oskar Schindler saved years ago. That is what Schindler's List is most of all about the fight against bigotry and injustice.

This is a upsetting and heart-wrenching motion picture that is sure to bring some people to tears. With an excellent cast, a beautiful score and harrowing camera-work, Schindler's List succeeds on so many levels.Set in Poland during World War II, the film centers on Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a member of the Nazi Party who wishes to open a pots and pans factory in Krakow. Due to Jewish workers being much cheaper than Poles, he hires an accountant called Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help roll up Jews to work in the factory. Soon, more and more of them are hired and while Schindler originally saved the Jews for profit, now he wants to save them from being gassed in the concentration camps. Meanwhile, Schindler meets Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), a Nazi soldier who takes pleasure in shooting Jews. However, he also has a relationship with Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz), a Jewish woman who is sometimes abused, but also sometimes loved by Goeth. These two stories are also connected with those of the prisoners in the Ghettos and concentration camps, who are hired and saved by Schindler.The images of Schindler's List are very depressing and upsetting, but it could not have worked any other way. Spielberg portrays Nazi-occupied Poland accurately and thus, it's quite possibly one of the saddest films ever made. It's not an easy film to watch, but it should certainly be mandatory viewing. Schindler's List is not just a movie, it's a call for an end to prejudice. The Holocaust was one of the most horrific events of the twentieth century and it is perfectly filmed by director of photography Janusz Kaminski. The majority of the film is in black-and-white, a very intelligent decision on Spielberg's part, which actually makes the film look more realistic than if it was entirely in colour. Many scenes, including one involving a jammed gun, make us stop and think that maybe we shouldn't take things for granted. Steven Zaillian's screenplay is tight and manages to portray these real-life people very well with excellent dialogue. In addition, John Williams' score adds even more heartbreak to this tremendous film.Yet, it is the actors who truly sell the film. Liam Neeson shows plenty of range as a man, who starts off as greedy and only looking for profit and then slowly changes into a hero. Schindler is a man who wants to make money, but also wants to save lives and Neeson perfectly shows a man who can't have his cake and eat it, too. Ben Kingsley gives very subtle work as Stern, a man who is in two worlds that of the ghettos and concentration camps and then working alongside a man who can save his fellow Jews. While Schindler is giving him instructions, we see that Stern is secretly pulling the strings as much as he can. Finally, Ralph Fiennes truly shows that he is one of Britain's finest young actors with his role as the ruthless Goeth. We see in his eyes a man who is not just following orders like some Nazis were at the time, but really somebody who does believe a lot in Der Führer's evil ideas. Fiennes portrays his love for Hirsch very well, showing him at a crossroads. On the one hand, he hates Jews and believes them to be scum, but on the other, he has a deep admiration for Helen. Yet, he feels he must show his meaner side to the follow soldiers. Fiennes not only shows an evil man, but a man truly in love as well.Steven Spielberg is the master behind this brilliant production and everything about it is composed so well. He proved with this film that he has the ability to direct serious, dramatic films and this is the film that most people will view him upon. It is the story of triumph and how if you try, you can help save the world and lead to the end of racism and violence. After all, as the Talmud says, Whoever saves one life saves the world entire. This quote can be applied to people of all religions, not just those who Oskar Schindler saved years ago. That is what Schindler's List is most of all about the fight against bigotry and injustice.

Jack teams up with arms dealer Yaz (Dennis Rodman) to get his wife & child back & settle some unfinished business with Stavros himself...Three of Hong Kong's most well known action film makers have all made their American action film debuts directing a Jean-Claude Van Damme flick, John Woo made the excellent Hard Target (1993), Ringo Lam made the average Maximum Risk (1996) & now Hark Tsui follows his compatriots lead with the quite frankly awful Double Team. The script by Don Jakoby & Paul Mones is absolutely terrible, to be blunt it's totally embarrassing. Double Team is one of the most stupid & lamest big budget action flicks I've ever seen. It's meant to be some sort of action comedy that just fails on every level, technically & conceptually. Where do I start?

Then there's the fact that when the mines do explode it destroys the ENTIRE building yet Van Damme, Rodman, Paul Freeman & Van Damme's son can stand behind an ordinary Coca Cola vending machine which shield's them from the intense flames to an extent where they aren't even singed & the vending machine isn't destroyed? What about the scene in which Stavros warns Van Damme about the car he has wired & not to drive it? Eh? If he wanted Van Damme dead why warn him not to drive the car? The best, most discreet way to find your kidnapped wife while everyone is looking for you is to take along a 7 foot tall black guy with green hair & nose, ear & tongue piercing, isn't it? European monks are computer literate & accept gifts from arms dealers, aren't they? What about the opening sequence which is never mentioned again & seems only half complete? Damned I could go on all day about how stupid & moronic this film is, I really could. The only positive is that it's not dull & there's plenty of things going on.Director Tsui does a terrible job, there's so much slow motion & the action scenes are just stupid.

The work out scenes with Van Damme as he bench presses a bath of water, these montage scenes would look embarrassing in a Rocky flick! There's a bit when Van Damme trips on some coke cans (lots of product placement in this) & as he flies through the air does some kicks & knocks a couple of bad guys out before he hits the floor!

Spoilers Ahead!The Godfather, Part II is another gem of a movie, worthy of a place alongside its revered predecessor. This movie's strengths lie in Copolla's retention of the best actors from the first film mixed in with terrific new actors for the second. John Cazale, Lee Strasberg, Robert de Niro and Michael Gazzo are given their moment to shine here, and play credible and unforgettable characters. Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Robert Duvall reprise their roles from the first movie, and put in an equal amount of effort to the first film, which means that the second is also very good. Copolla had a lot more creative freedom with this picture, but it doesn't differ much from the first in terms of style and camera angles. Still, the director does an admirable job crafting an interesting and wonderful film.Pacino's Michael Corleone is, in the first, a quiet and understated character most of the time, only this time, whenever the character is riled by a tragic event, Pacino lets out his infamous scream to emphasize that his character is like a dangerous time bomb with an unpredictable temper one minute he's calm, the next he's in a rage. Unfortunately, Pacino is most remembered for his loud, bombastic performances rather than his understated quiet ones. Keaton appears to have less screen time, but, like her husband Michael, undergoes a credible transformation from the naive, submissive character we remember from Part I into an assertive, strong woman who will not give in to her husband. She asserts control over her own body by aborting her baby rather than letting Michael have another heir to his criminal empire. Again, Keaton's performance is usually cited as the weakest of the Godfather saga, but this seems unfair, and she does well whenever she has screen time. Robert Duvall is back with another excellent turn as Corelone family adviser Tom Hagen.The new faces do very well here, and again, Copolla was blessed with an excellent cast. Gazzo is simply delectable as mobster Frank Pentangeli, one of cinema's most memorable characters. One minute he's a lovable old man, sometimes seeming as dopey and sweet as your great-uncle, asking the band to play an Italian tarantella; the next he's viciously asking for the blood of the Rosato Borthers. He, ultimately, cows to Michael's control during a Senate hearing, just as he is about to rat him out.Gazzo, a prolific playwright, showed he had the chops as an actor as well. Another memorable performance is the Italian actor who played the gangster Don Fanucci, a dandy tyrant who shakes down Italian immigrants for protection money. He, like the guy who played The Turk Solozzo in Part I, is a convincing actor who can make a slimy villain come to life. He seems to relish his role as the white coated mobster who confidently rules the neighborhood with an iron fist. Less potent is Lee Strasberg's Hyman Roth, who, after Don Fanucci, is the film's main antagonist. Roth's true evil is only revealed in other characters' dialogue and indirect screen action rather than anything we see Roth do on the screen. I wasn't fully convinced that Roth was a cunning double-crosser, as we don't actually see him engage in the double-cross. Strasberg gives an understated performance as the kingpin of the pre-Castro Havana casinos (an obvious representation of real-life gangster Meyer Lansky). Still, Strasberg does have some memorable moments, such as the famous This is the Business We've Chosen speech he gives to Michael.Fresh performances from John Cazale and Robert de Niro round out this movie. We don't see much of Fredo in Part I, but he's essential to Part II. Cazale gives a memorable performance as the meek, weak, sweet, but ultimately treacherous middle brother of the Corleone family. His flaws include his lack of intelligence and possible naiveté, which ultimately result in his being a pawn in Roth's scheme to kill Michael. Fredo wants the keys to the kingdom, but will settle for some power, and Roth apparently offered him something special for his services. All Fredo says is that there was something in it for me!, but what this was is rather vague; still, Fredo's ties with Roth are enough for Michael to commit the darkest murder he will commit in the saga fratricide. We almost feel sorry for Fredo as he sweetly tells his nephew how to catch a fish by reciting a Hail Mary, right before Michael has one his goons shoot him from behind on a fishing trip. Fredo may be the rather weak and dopey member of the Corleone clan, but Cazale also manages to humanize Fredo and make a memorable performance as the ultimately tragic odd man out in the family business. Part II carries with it a sadder tragedy than Part I, as Michael loses his family, in terms of his wife's abortion and departure, and Fredo's treachery and his eventual murder. It is in Part II that we see the full scope of the perils of a life of crime in terms of keeping a family together. Even Don Vito, while running a criminal empire, was able to somehow keep his family glued together. We see the sad irony when Michael's mother tells him you will never lose your family. This is an excellent movie, much like the first one. Copolla does well here. (Copolla's further career is debatable. Radio host Phil Hendrie once gave a hilarious criticism of Copolla's career what do you mean 'Charlie don't surf?!') He directs beautifully here, and the actors cooperate by giving excellent performances. This is a highly recommended movie.

All Fredo says is that there was something in it for me!, but what this was is rather vague; still, Fredo's ties with Roth are enough for Michael to commit the darkest murder he will commit in the saga fratricide. We almost feel sorry for Fredo as he sweetly tells his nephew how to catch a fish by reciting a Hail Mary, right before Michael has one his goons shoot him from behind on a fishing trip. Fredo may be the rather weak and dopey member of the Corleone clan, but Cazale also manages to humanize Fredo and make a memorable performance as the ultimately tragic odd man out in the family business. Part II carries with it a sadder tragedy than Part I, as Michael loses his family, in terms of his wife's abortion and departure, and Fredo's treachery and his eventual murder. It is in Part II that we see the full scope of the perils of a life of crime in terms of keeping a family together. Even Don Vito, while running a criminal empire, was able to somehow keep his family glued together. We see the sad irony when Michael's mother tells him you will never lose your family. This is an excellent movie, much like the first one. Copolla does well here. (Copolla's further career is debatable.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"16 July 2007","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Warning! Spoilers Ahead!The Godfather, Part II is another gem of a movie, worthy of a place alongside its revered predecessor. This movie's strengths lie in Copolla's retention of the best actors from the first film mixed in with terrific new actors for the second. John Cazale, Lee Strasberg, Robert de Niro and Michael Gazzo are given their moment to shine here, and play credible and unforgettable characters. Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Robert Duvall reprise their roles from the first movie, and put in an equal amount of effort to the first film, which means that the second is also very good. Copolla had a lot more creative freedom with this picture, but it doesn't differ much from the first in terms of style and camera angles. Still, the director does an admirable job crafting an interesting and wonderful film.Pacino's Michael Corleone is, in the first, a quiet and understated character most of the time, only this time, whenever the character is riled by a tragic event, Pacino lets out his infamous scream to emphasize that his character is like a dangerous time bomb with an unpredictable temper one minute he's calm, the next he's in a rage. Unfortunately, Pacino is most remembered for his loud, bombastic performances rather than his understated quiet ones. Keaton appears to have less screen time, but, like her husband Michael, undergoes a credible transformation from the naive, submissive character we remember from Part I into an assertive, strong woman who will not give in to her husband. She asserts control over her own body by aborting her baby rather than letting Michael have another heir to his criminal empire. Again, Keaton's performance is usually cited as the weakest of the Godfather saga, but this seems unfair, and she does well whenever she has screen time. Robert Duvall is back with another excellent turn as Corelone family adviser Tom Hagen.The new faces do very well here, and again, Copolla was blessed with an excellent cast. Gazzo is simply delectable as mobster Frank Pentangeli, one of cinema's most memorable characters. One minute he's a lovable old man, sometimes seeming as dopey and sweet as your great-uncle, asking the band to play an Italian tarantella; the next he's viciously asking for the blood of the Rosato Borthers. He, ultimately, cows to Michael's control during a Senate hearing, just as he is about to rat him out.Gazzo, a prolific playwright, showed he had the chops as an actor as well. Another memorable performance is the Italian actor who played the gangster Don Fanucci, a dandy tyrant who shakes down Italian immigrants for protection money. He, like the guy who played The Turk Solozzo in Part I, is a convincing actor who can make a slimy villain come to life. He seems to relish his role as the white coated mobster who confidently rules the neighborhood with an iron fist. Less potent is Lee Strasberg's Hyman Roth, who, after Don Fanucci, is the film's main antagonist. Roth's true evil is only revealed in other characters' dialogue and indirect screen action rather than anything we see Roth do on the screen. I wasn't fully convinced that Roth was a cunning double-crosser, as we don't actually see him engage in the double-cross. Strasberg gives an understated performance as the kingpin of the pre-Castro Havana casinos (an obvious representation of real-life gangster Meyer Lansky). Still, Strasberg does have some memorable moments, such as the famous This is the Business We've Chosen speech he gives to Michael.Fresh performances from John Cazale and Robert de Niro round out this movie. We don't see much of Fredo in Part I, but he's essential to Part II. Cazale gives a memorable performance as the meek, weak, sweet, but ultimately treacherous middle brother of the Corleone family. His flaws include his lack of intelligence and possible naiveté, which ultimately result in his being a pawn in Roth's scheme to kill Michael. Fredo wants the keys to the kingdom, but will settle for some power, and Roth apparently offered him something special for his services. All Fredo says is that there was something in it for me!, but what this was is rather vague; still, Fredo's ties with Roth are enough for Michael to commit the darkest murder he will commit in the saga fratricide.

Don't mistake the brusqueness of style, the punchy delivery and starkness of this film for one-dimensionality. Just as the work of Preminger is greater than the sum of its parts, so Laura is more than meets the eye. It owes a lot to the excellent and subversive book by Vera Caspary from which it is taken. (Am I the only one who had no idea women were instrumental in every sub-genre of pulp magazine writing from the 20s to the 50s?) Much of the psychodrama came from the book &#150; but the visual and stylistic tone is pure filmic noir. However, in classic film noir the femme fatale is always the powder keg for everyone around her, and she usually pays for her sin with death. In Laura the central death is only the start of the story, not its retributive finale; the 'femme fatale' anti-heroine is really no such thing; and its hero, a portrait of curt masculinity, falls most unusually for an image, an idea. * * * spoilers from here on * * * This isn't so much a study in police procedure as a study of a man in love. The underrated Dana Andrews' Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson may seem like a cartoon hard-boiled copper, but look a little harder his terse, tense, scrutinising detective is a study in the transformative power of love on such a man. From Waldo Lydecker, Laura's friend, we learn that McPherson is damaged &#150; a silver shinbone in his leg as a result of a gun battle with a gangster. He reveals very little of himself &#150; we know him rather from what others say, or by his actions. But his tension, control and intelligence lends an edge to his masculinity. He has ways of looking which speak volumes. His big, sad eyes reflect the bafflement of a man lifted by the love he finds himself experiencing. He plays continually with a baseball toy, to rein himself in. The point &#150; reinforced by a great punch late in the film &#150; is that he has reason to. The sensual, swooning quality of the theme music is made flesh by the magnetic Laura herself (Gene Tierney). She's not just beautiful &#150; she's like something people dream of. Mark thinks he's dreaming when he wakes to find her standing before him she's the woman who could make him feel whole. Laura &#150; whom he gets to know, uniquely, from the inside out &#150; is neither a 'doll' nor a 'dame' (his enraging, early words); and in reaching for her he becomes a gentleman, against his own character or background. His 'real' gentleman is in marked contrast to the apparent gentlemen (and Laura's admirers) that we first meet &#150; the acerbic, snippy Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb on great Wildean form), who narrates the first half of the film, and the Southern playboy Shelby Carpenter (an oddly cast Vincent Price).

From here on in, it isn't Waldo's world any more, it's hers, and his. I think Tierney takes great credit for Laura not merely being the story of a tussle between three men for something they want she shows you that there's something she wants, too, and that she has the spark and independence to get it.The extraordinary circumstances of McPherson's contact with Laura lends their connection an intimacy which isn't lessened by the suspicion under which she labours. When Mark makes a move to arrest her at one point, it's almost as if she wants to go; she'd rather be with him under arrest, than listen to Waldo's sniping, or put up with Shelby's lies and lack of faith in her. The moral ambiguity created by these circumstances sets the tone of the piece, creating a sort of swirling, swoony romance with a very dark heart.Laura stands watching and re-watching. For an interesting companion piece, check out Tierney and Andrews a few years down the line (and both incidentally somewhat battered about by life), in another great noir, Where the Sidewalk Ends.

The master director crafted a haunting vision of alien invasion in War of the Worlds, a gripping tale of futuristic moral dilemmas in Minority Report; but only in A.I. did he manage to cream all these into one epic tale that included both over the top visual effects, as well as engaging characters and a sentimental story of family and love. Granted, this is still Spielberg and we are dealing with unconventional robot love, but still, I bet he'd rather we all think of it as a 21st century Pinnochio if anything else.A.I. places us sometime in the not-so-distant future, where humans create realistic and highly advanced robots (mechas) to serve them. David (Haley Joel Osmont from The Sixth Sense fame, in his last big role before disappearing into oblivion) is a child-robot, who is designed to give his undivided love to his adopting mother, Monica (Frances O'Connor), who decides, with her husband, to take him into their home after their biological son Martin turns ill. When Martin returns, he decides to get rid of his android brother, whose robotic programming isn't all that fit to deal with sibling rivalry. When an unfortunate sequence of events make David unwillingly hurt the ones he is programmed to love, Monica gets rid of him in one of the most heartbreaking scenes I can remember. But David is determined to win back his mother's love, and since that's what he's programmed to do, he goes out on a quest to find the Blue Fairy, after he learns of her ability to turn him into a real child (and there's Pinnochio again, for those who lost count). David's journey is a destructive one, since it takes him into the darker realms of this alternate future. In this world, humans eliminate obsolete robot in horrific flesh fairs, and even his faithful robot-teddy bear, Teddy (one of the cutest special effects I've ever seen), can't always talk sense into him.Even though the film demonstrates the corruption of human ethics in the future, it portrays David as a pure and gentle spirit, much more human and humane than most of the habitants he encounters on his journey. Jude Law shines in his supporting role as Gigolo Joe, the charming escort robot who, like David, fights for survival while developing emotions he was never supposed to have.I remember watching A.I in theaters shortly after 9\/11, and the thing I found most ironic about it was that with all the apocalyptic nature of the film, we still get to see the World Trade Center 200 years in the future; teaching us that sometimes reality can be far harsher than what we may expect even in our darkest dreams. Despite the overlong ending that bothered me in War of the Worlds as well, A.I. is nothing less than an impeccable and disturbing vision of what our future might look like, if we don't wake up fast.

George Lucas) Story The evil Trade Federation, led by Nute Gunray is planning to take over the peaceful world of Naboo. Jedi's Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi are sent to confront the leaders. But not everything goes to plan. The two Jedi's escape, and along with their new Gungan friend, Jar Jar Binks head to Naboo to warn Queen Amidala, but droids have already started to capture Naboo and the Queen is not safe there. Eventually they land on Tatooine, where they become friends with a young boy known as Anakin Skywalker. Qui-Gon is curious about the boy, and sees a bright future for him. The group must now find a way of getting to Coruscant and to finally solve this trade dispute, but there is someone else hiding in the shadows.Actors 'Star Wars I' has a mixed bag of actors and actresses. The problem with this being a Star Wars film, is that it's so well known, that everyone seems to be eager at scoring a role in it. The other problem is the huge amount of blue screen used, which can cause a lot of problems for those stars who have very little imagination. Some of the stars are actually very good in this film and really fit in well, and some stars feel slightly off and fill uneasy with the blue screen and the dialogue. I could use this review to slag off Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker, but out of all honestly, I really do not see the problem with him. He is young and do lack the experience which other actors have, but the one thing he doesn't do it ruin the movie. Everyone brings him up as ruining Star Wars, but this is untrue. If he ruined Star Wars, then how come the franchise is still as popular now as ever? Ahmed Best brings an interesting character to life. Jar Jar Binks can become slightly annoying, but is more aimed towards the children audience, which this film is actually aimed towards. Also, Ray Park was magnificent as Darth Maul, and there was not enough of him in the film.Music As always John Williams brings an amazing score to the film. It's wonderful that John Williams was back creating the music for this universe. There are some nice action tunes played and some lovely little sections of familiar themes we've heard before. The 'Dual of the Fates' theme was amazing and so majestically played during the final fight. To put it simpler, John Williams has created a beautiful soundtrack for this movie.Special Effects The one thing you can guarantee when you enter a Star Wars film is amazing special effects. It's so obvious viewing them, that a lot of time and hard work has been put into them. There are a view exceptions though, especially the computer generated characters of Jar Jar, Boss Nass and the pod-racers. All the vehicles are beautifully created and look as if they are actually there. The miniatures which are used fit in so well with the rest of the effects, that it really makes it hard to work out which is a model and which is CGI. It just all looks so realistic.Conclusion If you've seen any of the other Star Wars films, then you should really enjoy this.

The two Jedi's escape, and along with their new Gungan friend, Jar Jar Binks head to Naboo to warn Queen Amidala, but droids have already started to capture Naboo and the Queen is not safe there.

The problem with this being a Star Wars film, is that it's so well known, that everyone seems to be eager at scoring a role in it. The other problem is the huge amount of blue screen used, which can cause a lot of problems for those stars who have very little imagination. Some of the stars are actually very good in this film and really fit in well, and some stars feel slightly off and fill uneasy with the blue screen and the dialogue. I could use this review to slag off Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker, but out of all honestly, I really do not see the problem with him. He is young and do lack the experience which other actors have, but the one thing he doesn't do it ruin the movie. Everyone brings him up as ruining Star Wars, but this is untrue. If he ruined Star Wars, then how come the franchise is still as popular now as ever? Ahmed Best brings an interesting character to life. Jar Jar Binks can become slightly annoying, but is more aimed towards the children audience, which this film is actually aimed towards. Also, Ray Park was magnificent as Darth Maul, and there was not enough of him in the film.Music As always John Williams brings an amazing score to the film. It's wonderful that John Williams was back creating the music for this universe. There are some nice action tunes played and some lovely little sections of familiar themes we've heard before. The 'Dual of the Fates' theme was amazing and so majestically played during the final fight. To put it simpler, John Williams has created a beautiful soundtrack for this movie.Special Effects The one thing you can guarantee when you enter a Star Wars film is amazing special effects. It's so obvious viewing them, that a lot of time and hard work has been put into them. There are a view exceptions though, especially the computer generated characters of Jar Jar, Boss Nass and the pod-racers. All the vehicles are beautifully created and look as if they are actually there. The miniatures which are used fit in so well with the rest of the effects, that it really makes it hard to work out which is a model and which is CGI. It just all looks so realistic.Conclusion If you've seen any of the other Star Wars films, then you should really enjoy this.

She gets herself hired on as a nanny for the new little one, and the manipulation starts almost immediately thereafter, when Peyton (as she now calls herself) deliberately ruins a dress that Claire plans to wear for an evening out with her husband and another couple after Claire confides to her that her husband bought her the dress and that she feels sexy when she wears it. Things quickly escalate, as the older daughter becomes more attached to Peyton than her own parents (due in no small part to Peyton's deliberate emotional manipulation of her) and the baby starts to become fussy when anyone other than Peyton tries to hold him and will not nurse from his own mother.

But no - she lays the pillow down in the crib, picks the baby up as gently as anyone could want, and begins nursing.Peyton then continues to pull emotional strings by planting evidence that the mentally challenged groundskeeper (Ernie Hudson)has been molesting the daughter, then convincing Claire that her husband has rekindled a romance with Marlene (Julianne Moore), his former flame and current friend and the wife in the other couple I mentioned earlier. This leads to a scene at a surprise party in which Claire ends up humiliating herself, not to mention her husband and Marlene, who are innocent of what Claire has been led to believe.

If I didn't know better, I might think that this was directed by as well as written by a woman.) This final showdown is, again, as much about emotional as physical brutality.

I had read so many great things about Don't Look Now and the plot, the locations and the characters looked compelling enough to me to give this movie a chance and be prepared to enjoy an over and done masterpiece. Frankly, I am aware that most people who like this film, are probably going to think I'm terribly brainless because I was somehow disappointed by it, but I would much rather speaking my mind and giving my honest opinion.The main reason why this film turned into a disappointment to me, was mostly the fact that there were quite a lot of scenes that worked as a sleeping pill to me. I think I have seen a decent share of horror films that offer big moments of silence and so-called clever symbolism and subtle details that somehow help to build a solid story. However, in Don't Look Now, I felt a bit overwhelmed by the excessive amount of pointless sequences (and I'm pretty sure they ARE pointless) and images that in the end are reduced to nothing whatsoever. I felt like most of these puzzling and unsolved details, were Nicolas Roeg's way to mystify the audience with discourteous methods and filling blanks to make the movie longer and by some means more interesting to look at. Nevertheless, opposite to what those chaotic sequences were meant to incite, I felt somehow underestimated and ripped off. This film could have offered the same story and lots of bright symbolism, without the requirement of bombing the audience with tedious states of affair. I'm very supportive of ambiguity in horror films, when help to create a sinister atmosphere, at least. As an example, I'd probably mention Lucio Fulci, whose films are mostly criticized by the great quantity of nonsensical scenes. However, in Mr. Fulci's case, I think the puzzling aspect of his films, at least contribute in a great deal, to develop a terrifying atmosphere. So to make it short and clear, what I condemn the most about Don't Look Now, is its offensive and underestimating ambiguity that leads to nothing at all and simply leaves the audience doubting about their own intelligence.Too bad this film cheats the audience with so many pointless oscillations, because the story itself is not bad at all and the characters look darkly beautiful enough to make a frightening horror film, like the two old sisters, for example. The locations were probably one of the most appealing elements in Don't Look Now and probably one of the main reasons why I agreed to watch the movie until it was finished instead of just leaving it incomplete. I am not one of those horror fans who expect a big EUREKA! moment during the last minutes of a film, I can guarantee that. However, I do not appreciate feeling mocked after a movie is finished. I'm sure this comment will be voted as NOT useful several times by people who support this film and think I'm just an airhead who didn't get it, but that's all right&#133; I can live with that ;) (My five stars, mostly are due to the locations and a couple of eerie moments that made the whole thing endurable somehow).

I felt like most of these puzzling and unsolved details, were Nicolas Roeg's way to mystify the audience with discourteous methods and filling blanks to make the movie longer and by some means more interesting to look at. Nevertheless, opposite to what those chaotic sequences were meant to incite, I felt somehow underestimated and ripped off. This film could have offered the same story and lots of bright symbolism, without the requirement of bombing the audience with tedious states of affair. I'm very supportive of ambiguity in horror films, when help to create a sinister atmosphere, at least. As an example, I'd probably mention Lucio Fulci, whose films are mostly criticized by the great quantity of nonsensical scenes. However, in Mr. Fulci's case, I think the puzzling aspect of his films, at least contribute in a great deal, to develop a terrifying atmosphere. So to make it short and clear, what I condemn the most about Don't Look Now, is its offensive and underestimating ambiguity that leads to nothing at all and simply leaves the audience doubting about their own intelligence.Too bad this film cheats the audience with so many pointless oscillations, because the story itself is not bad at all and the characters look darkly beautiful enough to make a frightening horror film, like the two old sisters, for example. The locations were probably one of the most appealing elements in Don't Look Now and probably one of the main reasons why I agreed to watch the movie until it was finished instead of just leaving it incomplete. I am not one of those horror fans who expect a big EUREKA! moment during the last minutes of a film, I can guarantee that. However, I do not appreciate feeling mocked after a movie is finished. I'm sure this comment will be voted as NOT useful several times by people who support this film and think I'm just an airhead who didn't get it, but that's all right&#133; I can live with that ;) (My five stars, mostly are due to the locations and a couple of eerie moments that made the whole thing endurable somehow).

A  sequel to THE MUMMY'S HAND (1940) released two years earlier, this legend of Kharis continues, set thirty years later, with Dick Foran, Wallace Ford and George Zucco reprising their original characters sporting middle-age makeup consisting of gray hairs, glasses and wrinkles.The story opens in a town of Mapleton in Massachusetts, with the middle-aged widow named Steve Banning (Dick Foran) relating his scientific expedition to his sister, Jane (Mary Gordon), son, John (John Hubbard) and Isobel (Elyse Knox), John's fiancé, on how he, his now deceased wife, Marta (played earlier by Peggy Moran) and his friend, Babe Hanson (Wallace Ford) encountered the ancient burial ground of Kharis, the mummy. The next scene shifts over to Egypt where High Priest Andoheb (George Zucco), who amazingly survived three bullet wounds shot into him by Hansen and his long plunge down the temple steps (told via flashback), assigns Mehemet (Turhan Bey), to guide Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.) to America where his next assignment is to avenge the surviving members of the expedition, doing away with the Banning family and finally Babe Hansen, whose character arrives later in the story.Taking a new direction from its previous successors by shifting Kharis from Egypt to the United States, with similarities to Dracula (1931) where Kharis on board the ship, resting inside his tomb, bound for his destination with Mehemet as his guide in the similar fashion to Dracula's Mr. Renfield. Once in Massachusetts, Mehemet takes up residence as a cemetery caretaker with Kharis feeling right at home surrounded by tomb sweet tombs of buried beings. Like Dracula, Kharis stalks his victims at night and rests by day.While THE MUMMY'S TOMB tends to be original, it mostly borrows from other horror stories, including its predecessor where Mehemet captures Isobel to make her his bride as his predecessor Andoheb tried to do with Marta in THE MUMMY'S HAND. Besides resurrections and revisions, the film delivers towards its final half with chills and thrills, and Kharis meeting the same fate as the Frankenstein monster, who doesn't appear here.Supporting players include Frank Reicher (Professor Matthew Norman); Cliff Clark (The Sheriff); Virginia Brissac (Ella Evans); and Otto Hoffman (The Cemetery Caretaker).Strictly B material for the juvenile crowd, THE MUMMY'S TOMB is a fast-paced if not entirely incredible 62 minutes. Without the flashback and stock material from the previous film, this movie would have been ten minutes shorter. Minus the over abundance of comedy relief stressed out from THE MUMMY'S HAND, TOMB has all the familiarities from other Universal horror films from the 1940s, especially the stock musical score by Hans J. Salter. Although THE MUMMY'S TOMB did not become a top of the line Mummy show, it did lead the way to the next installment of THE MUMMY'S GHOST (1944), considered by many to be the best of all the Kharis thrillers.Footnote For anyone paying close attention to detail, it should be noted that since the first Kharis film installment obviously takes place in 1940, then this sequel, which looks very much like modern-day 1942, is set thirty years into the future, namely 1970. Otherwise if this is 1942, then the earlier film should have taken place in 1912 with actors in futuristic 1940s attire.Other than local television presentations prior to 1985s Fright Night\/Chiller theaters, and availability on video cassette and later DVD format, it's cable broadcast history consists of the Sci-Fi Channel (1990s) and American Movie Classics (2000-2002).(**) ","genre":null},{"date":"16 July 2007","score":"10 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" THE MUMMY'S TOMB (Universal, 1942), directed by Harold Young, the third installment in the Mummy series, the second to feature Kharis and the first starring Lon Chaney Jr. as the living creature under wraps.

After leaving a toy store with a cute stuffed animal and arriving at his new girlfriend (next intended victim's) place, he is arrested and kicked in the stomach by the detective (Hector Elizondo) who has been after him for years and even framed him by planting evidence (although it's okay in this case because HE DONE IT! Who cares what they had to do to get him?) In a clever bit of opening misdirection, we see shots of Bad Guy on his way to his latest target's place intercut with shots of our Heroine (waifish but not anorexic, blonde-haired-big-blue-eyed Lauren Holly) in her own place in such a way as to make us think that she is his new girlfriend, when in fact she is not.The two do meet, however, since our Heroine is a flight attendant assigned to the Christmas Eve flight on which Bad Guy is being transported to prison to await his execution. Along with Bad Guy is another con (Brendan Gleeson, in a Glee-ful performance) who's first words are his reply to our Heroine's question, What would you like?, referring to drinks. His response? I'd like to nail you, baby,, in the slimiest-sounding Cornpone accent you've ever heard. Is this guy really British?! Anyway, our charming con goes on to ask to be taken to the plane's bathroom, uses the soap-thingy as a weapon to kill the officer who is guarding him, and proceeds to make like Jeff Foxworthy if Foxy was a BAD-ASS Redneck. He ends up holding our Heroine hostage with a gun to her pretty blonde head, and who talks him into letting her go? None other than our Bad Guy, who at this point is still making like an unjustly accused and convicted Good Guy. In another dust-up, the other con and several others are shot. (The pilots have, in the midst of all this, been killed).Our Heroine is told by our Bad Guy that the pilot hit his head but is all right and is going to land. He begins to win her sympathy, asking her if she believes in capital punishment, to which she answers No. Our Heroine is sharp, however, and notices that the plane does not appear to be descending. She decides to go to the cockpit herself to check things out and finds the pilot and his co-pilot dead. She manages to make contact with the ground, however, and they patch her through to a pilot (Ben Cross, who brings his presence and accent to the role)who instructs her on how to communicate with the people on the ground and how to operate the plane(to LAND it, of course). Our Bad Guy, however, is determined that they will crash and, he hopes, take as many other people with them as possible. He shows his true colors, and it is at this point that it becomes almost impossible not to enjoy watching Mr. Liotta; he simply seems to be having so much FUN playing this particular wack-pot. As the plane tosses them to-and-fro (did I mention that they're headed into a six-on-a-scale-of-one-to-six thunderstorm?) our Heroine must defend herself after being coaxed out of the cockpit by our Bad Guy. While not trying to come across as the Xena of flight attendants, Ms. Holly is determined and tough mentally and also physically when forced to fight for her life. Yes, at one point, she uses sex - or at least the promise of sex - to get our Bad Guy to let his guard down for a moment, but, hey, it's one of the few weapons she has at her disposal, along with the fire extinguisher she clobbers him with shortly after the bogus come-on. (Why, under these circumstances, does our psycho-but-sharp Bad Guy believe for a MOMENT that the woman he's terrorizing would have sex with him, even to save herself and the few other people on board the plane he hasn't killed? Because it's a movie, children!) Anyway, after kicking a little Bad Guy butt and ultimately getting ahold of a Marshall's gun and killing him, our Heroine manages to land the plane. Merry Christmas! If you just want to shut down your higher brain functions and watch a good psycho-killer-chiller, and especially if you like it when said chiller supposedly takes place on Christmas, this is highly recommended for you. Cheers.

For me, it's Walt's crowning achievement, and when I watch it today, it still gives the same feeling of nostalgia as it did when I was six years old. In fact, I find even more thought-provoking than I did when I was a child.But what is it that makes Bambi stand out for me? There's magic here alright, but not the fairy magic like in so many other Disney films. There's humans, but they never appear on screen. I think that I was captivated by the way the musicians, the animators and the artwork all become synchronised, like the natural sounds of a real forest. What makes Bambi so wonderful is the feel of being so close to nature. During the scene where it starts to rain, we see Bambi's fascination with the little raindrops. As each little drop lands softly on something, we hear a little note from the orchestra. It is just so well synchronised, and it shows just how much love and dedication was put into it.Also, Bambi flawlessly flips from mood to mood. We watch a scene that is sad, dark and melancholy. It all fades to black, and we are greeted with something light hearted, colourful and joyful. In many other films, something like that would stick out like a sore thumb, but somehow, in an almost magic way, that does not happen with Bambi.What really annoys me is when I see people bash Bambi and call it 'anti-hunting pro-PETA trash.' I'm sure that when dear old Walt made this, he had nothing of the sort in mind. It also annoys me when I see people making a big deal out of one of the most touching and heartbreaking scenes in Bambi. (you know the one I'm talking about!) Sure, it's a poignant scene, but it is also only one tiny fraction of the actual film. So why must people take the Mick out of it, if there is no Mick to take? (That doesn't sound right!)If you are fed up of the huge amount of CGI that's lost its novelty years ago, then pick up a two disc Special Edition DVD of this lovable classic, before Disney locks it up again.
