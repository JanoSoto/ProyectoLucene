But what did I expect.This movie is typical of the garbage Hollywood churns out, and how typical of the blind masses to eat it all up. There are massive plot loopholes one could drive a truck through (Someone please explain to me, when in this virtual world, why do they need a phone to get out? That's like saying Quick, we need to touch a dog to get out of the matrix!)I have never once in my life seen so many good looking computer geeks. All so stylishly dressed as well, but then again, this is a definite style over content movie, with black clothes being so popular, it's no wonder the producer wanted people decked out head to toe in trenchcoats. After all, why bother to write a decent storyline when you can just fake it, put in lots of great special effects, trendy costumes, l33t computer H@xors and have it sell on these points alone? Sorry, not good enough for me.This movie is plain bad, from the moment it starts right up to the moment it ends, with all the blatant overacting inbetween.If you are one of those people that doesn't like to think when they watch a movie, (and no people, that whole Oh the Matrix makes you WONDER line is just lame, stop it) you'll love this. If you are one of those people that aren't swayed by pretty lights and fancy special effects used to wow most audiences, stay well clear of this.

When I first saw the trailer to it, it looked very campy and very dark. Playing in the was a 1960's rock song, right then I new the movie would be lots of fun. But also- I saw really good make-up of an alien- one looked scaley and another looked like the oval-shaped-slanted black eyes type of alien. Wow, this looks fun. When it opened up the first day, I thought it sounded like a good way to spend my Friday night. Boy was I ever wrong. First of all it was totally edited out. I could tell that a lot of the gore parts and sex scenes had been cut up a lot. When the movie was over I was extremly dissapointed that none of the aliens I saw in the trailer were in the movie. I was expecting some cool make-up and creatures. The story made absolutly no sense and it was all MESSED up. The violence and sex scenes were cut in order to receive a PG-13 rating I don't think any teens liked this movie anyway so it was a big waste of time. Too many mistakes made and too many missed opportunities.
