The two become fast friends but in-between school pranks (one of the local boys is determined to get Holmes expelled) they stumble upon a string of murders in the district that ultimately lead them to a cult, and form the foundation not only of their lingering friendship in much later years, but also hint at Holmes' notorious enemy, Professor Moriarty.I am naturally less inclined to like versions of Holmes in which he has some attachment to a woman, but this one does it better than most in the presence of the sweetly innocent Elizabeth, who has captured the soon-to-be great detective's heart. Her involvement in the tale is what hints at Holmes' later insistence that he will never become emotionally involved with another woman. All in all, it is quite an imaginative feat by a decent set of writers, although the grotesque, nightmarish hallucination sequences leave much to be desired.

The Fog is another fine Carpenter film. Although it has it's various scenes that are a little on the hokey side i.e. the townsfolk all carrying candles to march by the little dinky statue of the ship that was the basis of the towns founding. I don't know how many towns no matter how small they are would have such orderly citizens that would want to celebrate it's centennial in such a quiet manner. The corpse getting off the table in the morgue. Anyone would certainly hear the shoes walking on the tiled waxed floor. Father Malones father was also a priest? Making him the town's leading merchant etc. who picked the church to hide his journal in might have prevented the Hey priests can't marry or father children either question that everyone who sees this movie always seem to bring up. Despite these scenes this still is a good film because it's an old fashioned ghost story. The opening scene with John Houseman telling an eerie tale to a group of kids is great for an opening. The scenes of the beaches and open fields of the town just before dark when the mist starts rolling in with the sound of a fog horn in the background are creepy. One can almost feel the damp cold.  The leper ghost crew are done superbly (How would you like to go to one of those Haunted Houses during the Halloween season and in one of the rooms it's filled with waist high fog and lit just enough  to see a group of figures standing there like Blake and his gang?)   They are only seen as shadowy figures which is what makes them all the more scarier. John Carpenter did well with this film.

While it never achieves the excitement and awe that those movies brought to the big screen, it has its moments.The cast, for the most part, is outstanding.  Brendan Fraser plays another variation on his hunky-cartoony persona, swaggering and swashbuckling like an old pro.  Rachel Weisz is great as the feisty love interest, sort of a Lara Croft for the 1930's.  The chemistry between the two is real, and their dialog is witty and exciting.Arnold Vosloo makes a somewhat disappointing mummy, however.  He never seems very menacing -- largely because he looks more like a high school math professor than a mighty lord of the undead, with his doe eyes and pudgy face.Whether or not you like the special effects in the film will depend largely on how you feel about computer animation.  There are some shots, particularly of the mummy, that look like low-grade Hercules&Xena quality effects, a surprise since the effects were done by Industrial Light&Magic. Some of it works, some doesn't, and it all would have looked better with models and makeup (but I'm old fashioned).Regardless, the movie is cheery, exciting, and fun.  There is an element of Army of Darkness style camp which is good for laughs, but it also delivers some  good old-fashioned thrills and chills.No one will ever mistake The Mummy for a masterpiece -- it's too  slick, too post-modern, and at times embarrassingly silly (like the beginning, where characters stand around spouting plot exposition as if they're pitching us the movie).  But it's well worth the 6 or 7 dollars to see on the big screen.

I don't care much about the opening sequence but I really love other surreal scenes like when Heston is using the phone in a blind woman's shop and there's a sign that says, If you're mean enough to rob from the blind, help yourself while this unexplained grotesque woman with one eye opened unnaturally wide looms larger in the shot than Heston.  Or the part where Leigh has her ear to the wall and someone in a ridiculous Mexican accent is talking about marijuana making you feel good.  Leigh's character is amazing.  She's naive but admirably unafraid.  I love the part where she delivers an unflinching line of wonderful insults towards Grandi.  She's definitely one of the most interesting female characters in film for the time period.  Also, I find the scenes with Dietrich and Welles oddly arousing in their subtle nostalgic sexuality\/gloom, where he says he wishes he were getting fat off her chilli instead of candy bars and she says the chilli is too hot for him.  Also, the Mexican\/American tension is incredibly compelling, like in the scene where Quinlan is interrogating the guy, planning to frame him, and brutalizing him for speaking Spanish, while Vargas tries to be fair and speaks Spanish to him, sort of helplessly.  But then toward the end, Vargas has figured Quinlan out and when Quinlan tries to strut his authority, he says, You're in MY country now.  God, I love this movie.  The last line, by Dietrich, about Welles, is brilliant He was some kind of man.  What does it matter what you say about people?  Welles has this way about making the most simple lines and words (re rosebud) resound in the most hypnotic fashion.

I don't care much about the opening sequence but I really love other surreal scenes like when Heston is using the phone in a blind woman's shop and there's a sign that says, If you're mean enough to rob from the blind, help yourself while this unexplained grotesque woman with one eye opened unnaturally wide looms larger in the shot than Heston.  Or the part where Leigh has her ear to the wall and someone in a ridiculous Mexican accent is talking about marijuana making you feel good.  Leigh's character is amazing.  She's naive but admirably unafraid.  I love the part where she delivers an unflinching line of wonderful insults towards Grandi.  She's definitely one of the most interesting female characters in film for the time period.  Also, I find the scenes with Dietrich and Welles oddly arousing in their subtle nostalgic sexuality\/gloom, where he says he wishes he were getting fat off her chilli instead of candy bars and she says the chilli is too hot for him.  Also, the Mexican\/American tension is incredibly compelling, like in the scene where Quinlan is interrogating the guy, planning to frame him, and brutalizing him for speaking Spanish, while Vargas tries to be fair and speaks Spanish to him, sort of helplessly.  But then toward the end, Vargas has figured Quinlan out and when Quinlan tries to strut his authority, he says, You're in MY country now.  God, I love this movie.  The last line, by Dietrich, about Welles, is brilliant He was some kind of man.  What does it matter what you say about people?

Humor, good timing, off-timing and recurring horror all come together producing a full cinema experience.The romance is a little hokey, but not ridiculously so. I thoroughly enjoyed the modesty of the lead female character. The character, Evelyn Carnarvon, was delightful, smart and a lady.Brendan Fraser once again has chosen the role of a lovable leading man. He delivers the hero talents too, lots of punches thrown and knockin' around bad guys - both living and dead.Special effects? Very well done. Spooky stuff.Story line? Mmmmmmmm... There's a gaping free fall within the movie when the goal or goals are lost. But we, the audience, are along for this ride and we're all in this together. We're still having an acceptable night at the movies.About the humor... much of it was great. But I was upon saying the words to my husband as Brendan Fraser said my line. Granted, I'm a funny person, but that line must have been waiting there to be said. I struggle with it being a trite line or I'm a witty person of the same caliber as the screenwriter. (grin) Other than that and one completely flat line delivered by the character Beni deep into the film, the humor was good.This is a remake of an old horror film, and is as good as can be expected. There will be better films. But if the previews attracted you to the desert mystery, you won't be disappointed.
