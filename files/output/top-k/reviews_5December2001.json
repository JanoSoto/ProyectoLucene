It's a touching tale of orphans, specifically Homer Wells and his discovery of life outside of St. Cloud. There's much to be taken from this film for viewers of many ages, although children probably won't be prepared to enjoy it.While they are not biologically related, they enjoy and suffer many of the slings and arrows that a father and son would Wilbur loves Homer and gives him what he can, which is hope, protection and `near-perfect obstetrical procedure'. As children do, Homer resists Larch's goals for him, specifically to assume Larch's role as a doctor in the orphanage. Instead Homer ventures away when a convenient opportunity presents itself in the form of a young couple leaving after the woman had an abortion. The couple, Candy Kendall and Wally Worthington, are Homer's age but much more worldly. It is here where Homer's simple appreciation of the world is apparent and most appealing. He had never seen the ocean and so Wally and Candy show Homer the Atlantic. Candy will later show Homer a drive in movie theater, which Homer professes to love, despite it never being open . Homer looked forward to a career picking apples, typically reserved for migrants, and didn't think anything of living with the migrants in the cider house. He finds joy in every aspect of life at the orchard, while others find misery in the same setting. I admire Homer's approach and seek to find more joy in the mundane, every day occurrences that we are so often too busy to even notice.It is the rules from which the film, and novel, derive their title. Literally put, there is a set of rules posted in the cider house that are meant for the migrant workers. However, the workers cannot read, and so the rules are ignored in favor of their own unwritten rules. Many of the migrants' rules are governed by the deft knife of Mr. Rose, the foreman of the migrant workers. It is Homer that will reveal to the workers what the rules actually say, and unwittingly, it is Mr. Rose that will ultimately convince him of things that Dr. Larch had only tried to.It would be incomplete to review the film without mentioning the abortion issue, and yet it would be unfair to suggest that this is all the film is about. Dr. Larch accepts as the Lord's work to carry out whatever the women arriving at St Cloud's want. This is to say that he delivers babies when asked, and performs abortions (at a time when they are illegal) for those that aren't `quick', or too far developed. This is important to him as he is well trained and carries out the abortions safely while other women take matters into their own hands, often with dangerous and lethal results. Despite his best efforts, Dr. Larch never is able to convince Homer to perform abortions.The film and the book are not the same- the book is simply far too long to include everything. Homer's childhood is largely lost in the film, accounted for instead by a montage in the opening scenes and the introduction of Buster who reveals some of what Homer was as a child in the novel. Among the most notable differences are the absence of Melony and the chronology of the movie. Melony is a major character in the novel, only surpassed by Dr. Larch and Homer. She was a very powerful character, and Irving feared she'd overpower others in the film, especially since Michael Caine wanted to play a softer Dr. Larch. As for the time frame, the movie is greatly compressed. Whereas the book took place over several decades, and Homer leaves the orphanage for 15 years, the film takes place over 15 months. This requires of course some things to change- in the film Candy is the sexual aggressor, the war is already in force, and the origin of Larch's ether addiction is a mystery. More significantly, Homer is a part of the Worthington family in the novel, becoming close friends with Wally, living in the `fancy house', becoming Olive's pseudo-son, and becomes the boss of Ocean View. Finally, Angel Wells (Candy and Homer's child) is absent in the film adaptation.This is not to say that the film is delinquent. These omissions and changes were necessary to present the story in a film version, and thus the film is a faithful adaptation of John Irving's 1985 novel. It ought to be, because Irving adapted the novel for the film and won an Oscar for his efforts.This is not a fluffy movie to half pay attention to while doing something else. To do so may lead you to think like some of the other reviewers here, that its simply a story about abortion and nothing else. If you finish this movie and think that way, watch it again because you've missed a lot.
