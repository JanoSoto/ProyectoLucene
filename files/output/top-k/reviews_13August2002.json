No disrespect to Vin Diesel, Asia Argento, or any of the actors and crew. But this is by far the WORST film I have ever seen, and I've seen plenty of bad films. This film couldn't have been any worse, the dialogue was beyond dreadful, who ever concieved the idea of writing this film, then eventually putting it to script, should be taken out and stoned to death! The directing was awful, the acting was painful to watch. What's scary is that Vin Diesel is a decent actor, why would he sell out like that, by doing such an embarrassing and horrible film? I guess it truly is about money, I suppose art and having value in what you do just doesn't matter anymore, but hey to each his own. As far as Samuel L. Jackson I lost respect for him after Shaft.  There was just simply nothing good to say about this film. Given that this is an action film, and that plot and substance seem to not be big players in the grand scheme of things, but there was no story, there was nothing. It seemed as if the film makers, were like hey lets make a quick action flick, blow up a few things, throw in some half naked girls, a decent looking leading man, and we'll make lots of money. And that's exactly what they did. And the fact that they keep calling this the new breed of secret agent, makes me sick to my stomach. I know that Hollywood is probably at its worse right now as far as films are concerned but this one just simply took it too far. I found myself daydreaming during the film, thinking about things I had to do later. And why is it that people think non-stop action is great!? As far as I'm concerned everyone who participated in the making of this film should be embarrassed, its a travesty! Hey this is only my opinion, but I left the movie theatre literally enraged, I wanted to gain back the 2 hours of my life lost, watching the piece of crap film. If you want to loose major intelligent points then go see this film, I'm quite sure, your I.Q will drop more then 30 points!  What's even more ashamed, is being that the majority of American audiences probably thought it was a good film. And we wonder why nobody likes us.

Then forget about reading my review or anybody else's for that matter!  It doesn't take 2 brain cells rubbing together to know what you are going to get here, and you get PLENTY of it!  This was not a typical movie choice for me (my guy's turn to choose), but I had some idea what to expect and I think you do too. Having said that, here is a BIG SURPRISE - this was one of the MOST FUN, simply enjoyable movies I have seen in months, maybe a couple of years!!!  This film is wonderfully unpretentious.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, and we shouldn't either.  Does XXX provide deep intellectual insights, an elegantly constructed production with soul-searching performances, an air-tight plot with masterful dialog, gritty realism, completely true-to-life action scenes, brilliant editing?  Although the answer is obvious (in case you haven't seen the trailer, the answer is NO), a much better question is, WHO CARES?!  This movie is all about fun!  Crazy, mind-blowing, awesome (and in some cases,of course, obviously impossible) extreme stunts!  Diesel is charismatic and charming, the girl is sexy and engaging and the bad guy is appropriately nuts.  The plot is good enough. The way they take out a communications tower doesn't make much sense, but otherwise we'd miss out on another amazing stunt scene so once again, who cares!  (Hey, check out 'Signs', a supposed new masterpiece by a supposed great director, if you want to see a film that really makes no sense!) There's some humor and a few decent one-liners, too.  One of the Bond spoofs is even smartly hilarious (a car stuffed Bond-style with gadgets that end up being virtually useless).  The way this film is NOT extreme is also refreshing.  There is just basic shoot-em-up and action stuff - no extreme violence\/gore, no extreme profanity, no extreme sexual content, and no extremely 'important' artistic message.  In other words, nothing to detract from the great fun of a fast-paced, amazing stunt-fest that is light, refreshing, and visually awesome.  The perfect summer action flick!

And that whole bit with dogs (not 'dog animals'???) being the superior species and that pointless scene of trying to find out their 'favorite food' when there was nothing around to eat but rats anyway was really inane and forced the movie to drag on and on EVEN more if conceivably possible. (It was 6 PM and we BOTH fell asleep!) Also, all the people acted like imbeciles and it was embarrassing, they all acted like monkeys! (People don't devolve just because they don't know quadratic equations!) and they made it look SOO easy to escape this supposedly 'advanced species' that has been ruling the earth for what..1000 years? (..and should probably have the ropes down.) Furthermore, there is that whole Fort Knox business, and why Terl was so nice to Johnny.

If anything.. he makes it worse.There are also plot holes the size of Canada (which is incredible seeing as the plot itself is as big as Rhode Island in comparison.) and the fact that a bunch of cavemen with an average IQ of 56 could learn to fly military fighter jets in less than a week boggles the mind. And that whole bit with dogs (not 'dog animals'???) being the superior species and that pointless scene of trying to find out their 'favorite food' when there was nothing around to eat but rats anyway was really inane and forced the movie to drag on and on EVEN more if conceivably possible. (It was 6 PM and we BOTH fell asleep!) Also, all the people acted like imbeciles and it was embarrassing, they all acted like monkeys! (People don't devolve just because they don't know quadratic equations!) and they made it look SOO easy to escape this supposedly 'advanced species' that has been ruling the earth for what..1000 years? (..and should probably have the ropes down.) Furthermore, there is that whole Fort Knox business, and why Terl was so nice to Johnny. (He spares John's life OVER AND OVER after escaping 40 times, yet kills a bunch of his guards who were just doing their jobs!) Also.. what was with having him use the 'learning machine'?? That's the ONLY reason they win in the end anyway! And it never really explains why they need the minerals in the first place, why they look so freakin' ugly, why they needed to put that air-breathing stuff in there, why the radiation bomb made a huge explosion, why that one guy always looked like he'd just crapped his pants, why they put that whole pointless s*** about the 'good luck charm', why the cities look as if they've only been neglected for 20 years, why there's still electricity, why they started TRYING to make the main guy 'hot' as he got smarter towards the end of the movie, why the only girl aliens in the movie were portrayed as being whores and tramps, why there were so many brawl scenes, why when that guy said 'Watch your tongue' he had a Scottish accent for a minute, why they chose to have the world invaded in 2002 when the movie came out in '01, why that Forrest guy didn't even FLINCH when his hand got blown off, and why in the BLEEDING HELL ANYONE would think this movie is ANYTHING more than the worst movie of this millennium, if not the last as well. (But then again, I bet at LEAST one person watched Glitter all the way through and LIKED it&#133; is there no hope for the human race?)Well there might be if Roger Christian decides to end his directing career VERY soon.C'mon!

The guy cutting my hair (also a child of the 80s) was telling me about how he and his wife were going to have a baby, so he went out and bought a bunch of Transformers tapes so his kid would get to watch and love the same cartoons he did, only to be somewhat disappointed because he found out they were having a girl.  Until that day, the thoughts and memories of the Transformers hadn't crossed my mind for over 10 years.  Thinking of the Transformers brought my whole childhood back into perspective.  I couldn't really remember much, except for that my hero, the one who represented everything that was good in my childhood DIED in the movie.  Thats all I could think of for a good 2 weeks until my friends and I saw some guy wearing a Decepticon logo T-shirt.  We got to talking, and every one of my friends had watched and loved the series.  So we decided to see the movie after finding out it was on DVD.  Enough background info, time to talk about the movie itself.  There were some good parts, some bad parts, and some parts I still can't understand.  One scene in particular, the verdict scene with the sharkticons, I couldn't understand when I was little, and I still have no f'ing clue whats going on with that scene now.  One truly bad part was the weird Al dance scene.  When my friends and I all saw that we just groaned.  But it is outweighed by the good parts.  Like I already mentioned before, the one part that left a lasting impression on me was the scene that probably emotionally scarred me for life when I first saw it at the age of 3, the death of Optimus Prime.  I think this is the only movie that I ever cried watching, even though I was only 3 at the time, his death was that traumatic.  (I must admit that when my friends and I all watched the movie again, I had to hide back a tear during that scene).But that was the one thing that made this a great movie (which is the one point I want to make even though it took me 5 pages to get here) is the fact that Prime's death can have such an impact.  Just think about it, (I'm sure I'm not the only guy that shed a tear when he died, be honest) but this movie makes you have REAL feelings for when a PIECE OF METAL dies.  To me, that's amazing how when a big red truck dies, caused such an emotional surge.Those are my thoughts, and if you disagree, then you probably never watched the show when you were little.P. S. for you Transformer buffs out there, I was born in 1984 which means I probably never saw the first run of the series, therefore I saw it in syndication where they only showed the first two seasons.  That means the movie was truly an ending to the Transformers for me, which probably helped to give the lasting impact of primes death throughout my childhood.Oh, and one more thing for you Transformer buffs.  Everyone says comments on how beautifully animated it was, and how it is the bes American animation ever.  But it's not.  It is Japanese.  The story is American, but TOEI animation, a Japanese company did the animation.

But instead of really transporting the audience the way that 2001 A Space Odyssey did in 1968, the overall effect feels like a 500-level college philosophy lecture class.That is the main problem with this film, it starts out by displaying an unconventional and revolutionary method of film animation that hasn't been attempted before and starting the audience off with the phrase Dream is Destiny. Okay, so we're in for a surrealistic journey, cool. But then we're introduced to the conventional way of opening up a film with a journey by having the main character be picked up in a boat\/car and dropped off where he needs to be. From there, the main character is hit by a car and wakes up to have people lecturing to him in long and drawn out monologues. By this point, the film has see-sawed from unconventional to conventional back to being unconventional, never deciding if it wants to have a direction, or play like and animated documentary. The audience isn't interacted with, it's talked down to from a vacuous script posing as intellectualism.Fine, so you want to be a lecture film. What will the lecture be? Pretty much, simple stuff that anyone with half a mind and an open ear had heard before. So where does this experience of a film take us? Really nowhere. The film seems to want the audience to make up their own mind about what was lectured to them (as if the people who generally make up the audience for these type of empty existential indie flicks have never sat through a long and drawn out philosophy discussion before). But as for the character whose journey we are supposed to follow, he comes to no realization or achieves any kind of catharsis, he simply floats away.

The culture and its traditions, both good and bad we¡¯re entirely destroyed.Gone With the Wind soft-pedals the horrific realities of slavery.  The south is given the glow of a grand and dying better way of life.  It is presented as though it were an idyllic paradise.  The film¡¯s magnificent baroque cinematography contributes to this effect, who can forget that scene where Scarlett O¡¯Hera stands with her father atop a hill listening to him give a speech about the beauty of devotion to the land that you own.  The camera pulls back and we see a magnificent panorama of the white mansion surrounded by the green land and the red glow of the setting sun.  The scene is precisely mirrored later on when she looks down on the ruined mansion after the war has struck.  We are given a powerful contrast between the civilization as it once was compared to how it is after it has been crushed by war.Much of the movie¡¯s emotional power draws on its image of the remnants of a thriving culture and civilization slowly decay and vanish.  Against that backdrop, we see the passions and lusts of an arrogant and selfish young woman destroy lives.Vivien Leigh, displaying none of the wary vulnerability she shows in A Streetcar Named Desire, is a woman of iron.  She is in love with Ashley Wilkes, a quiet reserved southern gentleman.  This love seems most improbable, it is never explained, most likely she wants him simply because he is the least likely human being to return her feelings.  Her advances are known, but not objected to by Melanie played by Olivia de Havilland, a gentle ill soul who is supposed to represent the true Christian spirit. To get her hands on Ashley, Scarlett betrays and manipulates everyone in sight. She finally meets her match in Rhett Butler, a dashing, dangerous and brilliant cad, played by Clark Gable, the most lusted after actor of his day.  Originally connecting with Rhett in order to drive Ashley mad with Jealousy eventually the two become indispensable to each other. Throughout their years together they are both steadfast partners and opponents each vying for the upper hand in the relationship.  All this emotional turmoil takes place, as I have stated, against a background of social and political upheaval that seems to mirror the turmoil in their lives.Gone with the Wind successfully invokes the feeling of a world entirely different from our own.  It really does immerse you in the world of the old south.  For that reason the airbrushing of the issue of slavery and the racist depictions of the black characters are unforgivable.  Though it is worth noting that despite her stereotypical image, the character of Mammy, played by Hattie McDaniel in an Oscar winning role, is portrayed as having greater intelligence and maturity then her master Scarlett.Despite these reservations, Gone With The Wind is a cinematic landmark that demand to be seen by anyone with interest in the history of the film.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 August 2002","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Gone with the wind is first rate in spite of its obvious flaws.Essentially it is the story of a woman of enormous psychological power and ambition who finally meets a man who is a match for her.

Sam Jackson is great but that's just about what I want to say about acting. Photography on the other hand, now there's a department I want to say more about. It's phenomenal, the ideas used are simply sensational. The reflections, the places and angles of camera are all carefully thought out.

The Sixth sense was a splendid film, at last a horror movie that dared to be different. We've been having too much of that maskman chases teenagers -crap it was about time somebody came and showed how to make a horror flick that is stylish, slow-paced but effective. Unbreakable was even better than The Sixth sense. The basic idea of both of these films is well, I'll put it this way very stupid. Still, the way these ideas come true is ingenious. Bruce Willis makes another typical performance in the leading role. This isn't his movie, Unbreakable is clearly a director's film. Sam Jackson is great but that's just about what I want to say about acting. Photography on the other hand, now there's a department I want to say more about. It's phenomenal, the ideas used are simply sensational. The reflections, the places and angles of camera are all carefully thought out.

The movie adaptation is also alot more interesting than the original story, mainly because the characters are better developed and the story is livlier.  This is one of the few movies that surpasses the book.  The weakest point of this movie is the rather one-sided view of the penal system, even in the dated version of this story.

Johnny Depp further displays  his range by taking on this role, being totally  adrift in a world of drugs and alcohol. Kudos  to Terry Gilliam's for having the audacity to  make this film, which further exemplifies the  fact he needs to keep making drug induced  hysteria and make it palatable for the rest of  the population to understand.
