The film was remade for American television twice - first as Reflections of Murder (featuring Tuesday Weld, Joan Hackett and Sam Waterston) and later as House of Secrets (with Melissa Gilbert and Bruce Boxleitner). To be honest, both of those remakes are certainly interesting to watch, if lacking in the suspense and novelty of the original. Reflections is fairly faithful to its parent, while House of Secrets maintains the bare bones of the storyline and throws in a different setting and some elements of voodoo. If you have not seen the original, the enjoyment level of both those films will be elevated.The same cannot be said for the first dunderheaded attempt to cinematically remake the French classic for American audiences. Keeping the original name, story and setting would seem a step in the right direction, but the film fails due to some incredibly foolish choices.The action takes place at a private boys prep school overseen by the hateful Chazz Palminteri. In between stealing funds from the school, Palminteri enjoys subjecting wife Isabelle Adjani - who suffers from a weak heart - to assorted cruelties. In his spare time, he engages in S&M with ice queen blond teacher Sharon Stone. The two women - tired of his abuse - decide to murder him, drop his body in the disgustingly filthy school pool and make it appear that he drowned in a drunken accident. Naturally, nothing goes according to plan.The best thing about this film is probably the casting of Sharon Stone in the role made famous by French actress Simone Signoret. If anyone embodies some of the same cunning and sensuality of Signoret from the original in a modern actress, it would be Stone. Unfortunately, the screenplay and everything around her fails to support her in any way.The changes made to the screenplay are not improvements. While a remake need not be slavishly faithful to the original, it should not completely go off the beaten path the way that this film does, particularly in its finale. The shock twist ending of the original may no longer be fresh, but the shaggy dog pseudo-feminist tilt tacked on to this latest effort seems to come completely from left field and is a blatant misfire.If Stone was an inspired choice, the remainder of the cast is less so. Isabelle Adjani, looking puffy and listless, is completely underwhelming as the abused wife. At no point does she engage our sympathy and she often seems entirely too lacking in energy to be remotely terrified. This may well be the most laid-back frightened performance one has ever seen on celluloid.Kathy Bates shows up as a detective investigating Palmineri's disappearance and driving the women to distraction. Her performance is immensely enjoyable and she seems to be having a good time. As a cancer survivor, she gets to crack completely inappropriate jokes and attempts to lay the groundwork for the we're all sisters under the skin meme that creeps into the film's finale. Unfortunately, her character and performance belongs in a completely different (and one would argue better) film.And the casting of Chazz Palminteri as the abusive schoolmaster is a disaster. Palminteri, providing the same performance here as he does in his guise of the reliable Mafia hit man roles in which he specializes, is laughably miscast. As tough as he comes off, Adjani could arguably physically match him and Stone could step on him without blinking twice. Not only that, but we have to believe that there was something that attracted these two attractive women to him and kept them in his orbit when they could easily have moved on. Palminteri, resembling a large trout, and playing a man with the charisma of a barracuda, seems an impossible prospect for these women. We have to believe that one lovely woman would fall for him (much less two) and no gigantic leap of faith can make this happen.Director Jeremiah Chechik has absolutely no idea how to maintain suspense or an atmosphere of foreboding. The scene shifts are klutzy and obvious. The pacing is often laborious, which allows the viewer time to mull over the complexities of the plots and double-crosses played out before us and realize how absurd the entire scenario truly is - something that the original (as well as its TV remakes) never allowed the viewer time to contemplate. This material needs a skilled hand, but what is provided is a clumsy sledgehammer.The original is noted especially for its shock ending. This remake seems initially to be going for the same thing and then suddenly backtracks - with remorseless characters suddenly developing consciences and people conducting themselves in ways not previously indicated in their respective behavior. By the time all of the leads end up in a watery fight, one realizes what a foolish level to which the film has sunk.

However there is a far rarer emotional experience in movies, one that has only had one that has only really been done justice in a small number of pictures, and that is the feeling of despair. Different to mere sadness &#x96; not bittersweet; just pure, harrowing bleakness. This is not easy to get right on the screen.Director George Stevens was among the most competent and tasteful of Hollywood's emotional manipulators. Stevens would shoot a scene from numerous angles to give himself maximum coverage for the editing process &#x96; he himself likened it to a sculptor starting with a block of stone and whittling it down to a work of art. This is not to say that A Place in the Sun features a lot of cutting. In fact some of the picture's most powerful moments are in extremely long takes, such as Shelley Winters telling the doctor she is not married, often with movement on screen but not of the camera, such as when we focus on the radio while the speedboats rush past in the background. It's set-ups like this that instil that feeling of helplessness. Often the right choice of angle, seemingly incidental, can have a devastating impact, such as the shot at the trial with Montgomery Clift's face on the right and a woman in the jury looking accusingly at him dead-centre of the screen. There is often a slightly voyeuristic feel, as if we are watching the lives of others across a crowded room. This is often enhanced by the long, wordless sequences. Perhaps most important of these is the one which opens the picture, of an easygoing Clift receiving a lift from a cheerful trucker, which looks deceptively upbeat, especially under the strains of the warm and tender Franz Waxman score.A Place in the Sun also happens to be blessed with a cast that is note-perfect down to the smallest roles. The principle players are all of the newest generation of lead actors who had only emerged in the post-war period (well, Elizabeth Taylor had been on screen during the war but only as a child actress). Not only are Clift, Taylor and Shelley Winters appropriately youthful, but they have that capacity for realism and understatement that that generation championed. Clift handles the tough job of making his character, a fairly chequered chappie even if he is technically innocent of his crime, someone we can sympathise with. Winters is particularly good too, playing a somewhat melodramatic individual, but playing her in a way that is not in itself overstated. But it's not just the youngsters that shine. Each of the more experienced players is absolutely spot-on as well. Oscar-winner Anne Revere in the comparatively small role of Clift's mother is a real stroke of casting genius.There aren't many things wrong with A Place in the Sun, although I do wish they had kept the title of the Theodore Dreiser source novel (An American Tragedy) as it is an excellent title and one that conjures up both the tone and the context of this particular adaptation perfectly. It's interesting how this picture comes from the film noir's heyday, and at least on paper it fulfils the criteria of being a film noir &#x96; and yet it doesn't feel like one. I think this is because film noir, with its private investigators, femme fatales and wisecracking dialogue, is for the most part a stylised, comic-book genre. A Place in the Sun on the other hand is devastatingly real in its characters and their depictions. We become drawn in, first by the familiarity of the situations, and then by the absolute horror of how they unfold. A picture like A Place in the Sun does not make for comfortable viewing, but it is the sort of experience we should subject ourselves in once in a while, if only to keep us in touch with the darker side of reality.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"26 August 2011","score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Brotherhood of the Wolf has all the ingredients of a mediocre Hollywood action film. Don't get me wrong, my favorite movies tend to be American, but Hollywood also produces many cliché action flicks lacking in originality, but champion in cheesiness. With this film, one can see the French have masterfully picked up on it.Let me list examples showing how Brotherhood of the Wolf looks like a typical Hollywood movie  -A narrator presents the movie to make it look more intellectual than it really is, -Fight scenes in the rain with slow motion moments, typically with one dude kicking many people's ass all at once using eastern martial arts (in 18th century France), -Cool American-Indian thrown in, whose medicine and knowledge is somehow better than that of a developed country, cause he's so close to nature and all.., -Very politically correct denunciation of racism and ignorance (but granted, typical French movies also do that a lot), -References to real historical facts in order to flatter the more cultured audience's intelligence,-Female characters who other than their hotness are absolutely useless,-Lack of character development (does anyone actually care for the main characters?), -Surreal dream-sequence added to make the movie seem mystical, -Uninteresting romance seemingly thrown in the movie for the Hell of it, -Scene where the main character takes his revenge in a hate-fueled bloodbath, -White guy goes all Rambo on the bad guys, dressing like an American-Indian in the process because he surely learned how to be a commando when he fought with Indians in North America, -Unrealistic conspiracy theory revealed like it's something awesome, -Final face-off fight during which the antagonist explains his actions,-Many anachronisms, -Cheesy ending which tries desperately to be tragic.I surely forgot some moments, but these are examples which made me smirk or sigh. Brotherhood of the Wolf stays a relatively entertaining movie, although sometimes I wished it could just cut to the chase, so I believe it at least deserves an average 5\/10. But contrary to what many people have said, it most certainly does not look like a French movie. I believe many non-French people rated the movie highly because in truth it looks American, yet it's French so it felt exotic and they were perhaps pleasantly surprised. But if this movie were American, it wouldn't have been praised so much in my most humble opinion.If you want to see a typical French movie, don't watch this one.

It was a big special effects movie that was made at the time of the rise of blockbusters like Jaws and Star Wars and still has fans today. But does it stand the test of time.On the planet of Krypton the ruling council ignores their leading scientist Jor-El's (Marlon Brando) warnings that their planet is about to face destroy and threaten him with exile to the Phantom Zone, a fate worst then death, if he tries to leave the planet. Given no option and seeing that his planet is about to be destroyed he put his only son Kal-El in a space ship and send him to Earth with all the knowledge Krypton has. On Earth Kal-El crash lands in Smallville and is raised by Jonathan and Martha Kent (Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter) as their son, Clark. Years later Clark (Christopher Reeve) becomes a reporter for a major newspaper, the Daily Planet and the North Pole his he created his Fortress of Solitude where he learns about his planet and its history. He becomes Superman, having abilities no one else Earth has and soon starts a relationship with Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). But villain Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) plans to commit the crime of the century and willing to kill Superman to do it.Before Superman all superhero programs and film serials were either seen as children programmes, like the George Reeves Adventures of Superman or the camp Adam West Batman. Even as comics were getting darker and more serious comic books were still seen as children's entertainment. This Superman project had a lot of potential, being one of the best known superhero and it had a long production. A number of directors were attached, Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, William Friedkin and Sam Peckinpah. Guy Hamilton of Bond fame, director Goldfinger, was set to director but had to leave because he could not live in England for more then a month because he was tax cheat. Richard Donner stepped in, having only made The Omen and a few TV Movies. Donner's directing is mixed, he is able to come up with some grand visions for Krypton and a dark sombre tone when Jor-El sends his son off as the planet is being destroyed. The action sequences are strong and the special effects were the best available at the time, though the flying effect does look a bit ropey by modern standard. But I do like the physicality of using models and more does need to be used for modern blockbusters. There are also tender moments between Superman and Lois Lane, the flying send being the most famous and Donner did do well for the most part for having to fit in a lot of the Superman story in one film, his origins from his childhood to his early days as Superman and mixing the tone and action sequences.For me however I do not have the nostalgia for Superman that some people have, growing up with this series. They see it a proper serious superhero film, but I find there are still problems. There is a lack of a good antagonist you can not really respect Lex Luther as the main villain of this film. He sometimes has a dark edge, killing a police officer like a Bond villain but for the most part Luthor and his henchpeople are just played for laughs taking away an threat they main hold and some of the leaps of logic is extraordinary, particularly how they figure out Superman's weakness is Kryptonite. Luthor has an extraordinarily dumb play and its only in Superman Returns when Luthor is actually a sinister and creditable villain. I think Donner was so focused on showing Superman's origins he didn't have time to develop a good villain. There are also so really cheesy and silly moments like when Lois and Clark at robbed and Clark's exaggerated geeky traits. There is also no set scene of time, with a lot of the characters looking like they were from the 50s. We can also not over look the ending, how the hell is spinning around the world and making it rotate backwards able to make time go backwards? There are a lot of problems with it and it causes a lot of plot holes, including Superman could have gotten both nukes within seconds. It is the type of ending which pretty much say the previous event didn't matter because we reset time.We know that there was a long casting process to find someone who could play Clark Kent and Superman, from James Caan, to Christopher Walken, to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Reeve was an unknown stage actor but he really was Superman, who was torn between Jol-El who was his mentor and his desire to protect Earth because of the ideals he was raised on. This Superman is a little more arrogant but that is because he is still young and starting out as a hero. But of course he is still a good man. Reeve had excellent chemistry with Kidder, both as Clark and Superman and she is strong in role as a smart journalist on the up. My view on Hackman is that his role was ruined by the comedy but at least there was so banner with Valerie Perrine. There is no denying Brando was a great Jol-El, giving his character a calm grandness and he played his role deadly seriously.Plus Superman has one of John Williams' best scores, a really powerful rousing bit music.Overall Superman is a fun film but what lets it down are some cheesy\/silly moments, a bit too much comedy and a lack of a treating antagonist. It is not the classic some people think it is but it is a worthy film. A 7.5\/10 would be a fair IMDb score.

The acting is average at best, the film work is a pretty poor effort with all the fake jerky backgrounds and the plot is a real stinker. This is one of those movies where each scene blunders into the next probably because they simply made it up as they went along. I can not help but feel that someone with a trunk load of money said lets hire the best director and actors, have a wild time making a movie and make a ton of cash no matter what the result. The only reason this movie floats is due to Grant and Bergman's charisma and the expectation that they will produce something memorable, but alas they are no match for an illogical and poorly constructed story line. Even though Hitchcock's directing is brilliant as always, it seems that no one is keeping an eye on the plot. Grants portrayal of a government agent is uneasy, you can tell he is uncomfortable with the role as it compromises his well trod persona of the flippant shallow charmer and thus he appears to be a bit out of his depth. The result of this is a stilted chemistry between Grant and Bergman. Bergman seems to fall in love much too fast and desperately to be believable and Grant doesn't seem to fall in love at all...because he is, I feel, attempting to play to the best of his ability a serious secret agent but is deprived of his own natural creative input unlike the carefree Romeo roles he is used to. Notorious is after all, supposed to be serious thriller and there's the problem - someone should have mentioned that to the writer. Do the secret agents have a plan - well, kinda...send the daughter of a nazi collaborator into the home of an ex-nazi to find out what he is up to because they suspect he's up to something being the nazi that he is..and that's it, no other reason. Nobody has staked out the house, they have no idea who comes or goes. These guys are not believable as secret agents, especially the handsome one...what's up with that anyway, twice he is referred to as good looking - what for, are they making fun of his HUGE nose or is it some kind of in-joke on the set. So they set up Alisha to accidentally meet Alex..with Devlin right next to them. You might be thinking, well that doesn't matter because the agent is going to drop out of sight and won't be seen again - wrong, Devlin doesn't give a stuff if they suspect him or not. So Alex has a dinner party and invites Alicia who can't help herself but look extremely suspicious even though nothing unusual happens. The chap jibbering at the wine bottle may well have been drunk for all she knew. You can't understand a word he said anyway but nevertheless they knock him off just for good measure...true Nazis indeed, too bad he was their only metalurgist. The next day they go to the races where Devlin meets Alicia to exchange information, right under Alex's nose, but alas, no alarm bells just yet. Alex, like an insanely jealous 10 year old, has fallen in love with Alicia almost instantly and wants her to prove she doesn't love Devlin by marrying him...in a few days time. Up to this point she seems to be just uncomfortable around Alex who fails to notice there is ABSOLUTELY zero chemistry between them. This woman is one cold fish but she goes along with it anyway, Mata Hari could get a few lessons from this girl. This is where the alarm bells should be ringing off the hook. Do the Nazis put him on a plane back to berlin for such crazy schoolboy behaviour, do the agents pull her out because Devlin may have jeopardised her cover, why hell no, the stuff-ups are just getting going. In a dazzling moment of stupidity Alicia takes the Key to the wine cellar from Alex's key chain whilst he is getting changed. She is suspicious that he is keeping something in the cellar so instead of simply asking for the key or alerting Devlin who, like all good secret agents doesn't need a goddam key....she just goes ahead and steels it, an action from which no amount of plot twist can possibly redeem her buns, she has without doubt blown her cover as soon as Alex goes to the wine cellar. Had she forgotten they are having a big party with lots of WINE that night, what the hell was she thinking...that Alex might think the key just fell off the chain. But lets ignore this for a moment and assess the brilliant plan Devlin comes up with. He simply shows up at the party and is all over Alicia in front of Alex and his cronies but are they suspicious...nope, not in the slightest. Cary Grant's good looks are enough to unnerve any man and send them into spiralling depths of depression so they overlook his little indiscretions. Off to the cellar go Devlin and Alicia where they discover the secret wine bottle amongst thousands of other bottles in about 25 seconds. They high tail it back upstairs but Alex busts them on his way down just outside the cellar door, so Devlin executes stage 2 of his ingenious plan by grabbing Alicia and kissing her in front of Alex after which Devlin simply says sayonara and takes off, good plan dude, save your own butt.

The acting is average at best, the film work is a pretty poor effort with all the fake jerky backgrounds and the plot is a real stinker. This is one of those movies where each scene blunders into the next probably because they simply made it up as they went along. I can not help but feel that someone with a trunk load of money said lets hire the best director and actors, have a wild time making a movie and make a ton of cash no matter what the result. The only reason this movie floats is due to Grant and Bergman's charisma and the expectation that they will produce something memorable, but alas they are no match for an illogical and poorly constructed story line. Even though Hitchcock's directing is brilliant as always, it seems that no one is keeping an eye on the plot. Grants portrayal of a government agent is uneasy, you can tell he is uncomfortable with the role as it compromises his well trod persona of the flippant shallow charmer and thus he appears to be a bit out of his depth. The result of this is a stilted chemistry between Grant and Bergman. Bergman seems to fall in love much too fast and desperately to be believable and Grant doesn't seem to fall in love at all...because he is, I feel, attempting to play to the best of his ability a serious secret agent but is deprived of his own natural creative input unlike the carefree Romeo roles he is used to. Notorious is after all, supposed to be serious thriller and there's the problem - someone should have mentioned that to the writer. Do the secret agents have a plan - well, kinda...send the daughter of a nazi collaborator into the home of an ex-nazi to find out what he is up to because they suspect he's up to something being the nazi that he is..and that's it, no other reason. Nobody has staked out the house, they have no idea who comes or goes. These guys are not believable as secret agents, especially the handsome one...what's up with that anyway, twice he is referred to as good looking - what for, are they making fun of his HUGE nose or is it some kind of in-joke on the set. So they set up Alisha to accidentally meet Alex..with Devlin right next to them. You might be thinking, well that doesn't matter because the agent is going to drop out of sight and won't be seen again - wrong, Devlin doesn't give a stuff if they suspect him or not. So Alex has a dinner party and invites Alicia who can't help herself but look extremely suspicious even though nothing unusual happens. The chap jibbering at the wine bottle may well have been drunk for all she knew. You can't understand a word he said anyway but nevertheless they knock him off just for good measure...true Nazis indeed, too bad he was their only metalurgist. The next day they go to the races where Devlin meets Alicia to exchange information, right under Alex's nose, but alas, no alarm bells just yet. Alex, like an insanely jealous 10 year old, has fallen in love with Alicia almost instantly and wants her to prove she doesn't love Devlin by marrying him...in a few days time. Up to this point she seems to be just uncomfortable around Alex who fails to notice there is ABSOLUTELY zero chemistry between them. This woman is one cold fish but she goes along with it anyway, Mata Hari could get a few lessons from this girl. This is where the alarm bells should be ringing off the hook. Do the Nazis put him on a plane back to berlin for such crazy schoolboy behaviour, do the agents pull her out because Devlin may have jeopardised her cover, why hell no, the stuff-ups are just getting going. In a dazzling moment of stupidity Alicia takes the Key to the wine cellar from Alex's key chain whilst he is getting changed. She is suspicious that he is keeping something in the cellar so instead of simply asking for the key or alerting Devlin who, like all good secret agents doesn't need a goddam key....she just goes ahead and steels it, an action from which no amount of plot twist can possibly redeem her buns, she has without doubt blown her cover as soon as Alex goes to the wine cellar. Had she forgotten they are having a big party with lots of WINE that night, what the hell was she thinking...that Alex might think the key just fell off the chain. But lets ignore this for a moment and assess the brilliant plan Devlin comes up with. He simply shows up at the party and is all over Alicia in front of Alex and his cronies but are they suspicious...nope, not in the slightest. Cary Grant's good looks are enough to unnerve any man and send them into spiralling depths of depression so they overlook his little indiscretions. Off to the cellar go Devlin and Alicia where they discover the secret wine bottle amongst thousands of other bottles in about 25 seconds.

The movie starts off with a hummable tune and planes on the screen, before which a narrator briefs us about Russia's mysterious doomsday weapon. The movie gives a satirical spin to one of the coldest, most fearful times in history- the Cold War, specifically the Cuban Missile Crisis. However, not much is required to get an overview of the theme for those not knowing much about the crisis aka Me.The film is about USA and USSR's deal to avoid any nuclear warfare as it may result in a cataclysm. Stanley takes a situation where the jingoism of the General, the lack of communication and procrastination in decision making leads to a cloudy end for all. It's highly avant-garde for a film of the 60s, and Stanley Kubrick executes it like a perfect soufflé that unfortunately has to burst since that's the ending- bleak and disturbing, resonating with the music 'We'll Meet Again'.Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper (named aptly after the famous serial killer) vehemently orders US planes to attack USSR, to prevent contamination of his bodily fluids by 'fluoridation' (!!) and this causes a panic in the Pentagon, with the US President trying to sort things out with an inebriated USSR President while being constantly jibed and detracted by General Buck Turgidson (again aptly surnamed!), who is a chauvinistic Nationalist with deep-rooted hatred towards Commie Russkies. This leads to a short brawl between him and the Russian ambassador which is so unparliamentary (or is it??) and chaos in the Pentagon. Jack D.Ripper meanwhile detains Group Captain Mandrake who has to listen to all his bull while trying to extract the three letter code that will connect them to the planes to detract them from taking offensive action. A parallel plot involves Major Kong trying to take down enemies with his crew in an immaculately constructed cockpit. One of the most beautiful aspects of the film is that the overacting is never overacted. Nearly every character is loony and yet has to be credulous enough to sustain the believability of the plot. In fact, Stanley Kubrick wisely decided to do away with the alien plot which would give the film a supernatural angle. Instead, we have a character displaying alien hand syndrome (Dr Strangelove), which makes him go berserk towards the end. The performances by the actors are terrific. Peter Sellers has to sell 3 characters and throughout the film one never finds sameness in the three roles. The quivering President who has so much to do now and can't do much due to the rigid policies gives a more subdued performance. Yet, the funniest part is when he talks to the USSR President to say No, I'm more sorry I'm fine. We are all fine etc. The second is Major Mandrake who incredulously asks the lunatic General Sir, when did you come up with this theory of fluoridation? and the funniest is his exchange with the officer towards the end of his plot line, where the chemistry gels so well &#x96; Just shoot at the damn machine he says, with the other officer replying Okay, but if you can't get to the President, you'll be answerable to Coca-Cola!LOLOL!!! Genius!!The third character is the Nazi-sympathizer Dr. Strangelove who talks about the alternate plan where humans will have to live underground for 100 years and breed like dogs (1 man &#x96; 10 women!). I think Stanley wanted to kill the audience since I almost died with laughter by the end. And the best part is that all the characters are dead serious. Another scene-stealer is George C. Scott whose best moments are the facial contortions that he does to show fragrant disapproval and suspicion. Also his interaction with his fiancé in the midst of an important discussion is crazy hilarious. Sterling Hayden is great, and I wonder how he could control his laughter while speaking about fluoridation and 'bodily fluids'. Slim Pickens suits his character to a tee, and his classic line is the 'Vegas' one. I wasn't particularly impressed by Stanley's The Shining, since I found it too verbose but the writing over here is fluid, humorous, brainy and inoffensive. Kubrick's direction is pitch-perfect and highly impressive since he didn't get much help from Pentagon. Since I have the DVD, I got the pleasure of seeing the making of the film and an appreciation of Kubrick.

In three films that he had done by 1981(Close encounters and Jaws to say the least), they had gotten nominated for best picture. And deserved it. I'd of thought it would be hard to top films like those, but he did it with 1981's Raiders of the Lost ark, one of his best films. Actually, its probably his second best film.It's hard to find a film thats more entertaining, fun, funny, brainy, and adventurous as Raiders of the lost Ark. This is the one that started it all. The first time America was introduced to the world of Indiana Jones. And i'm really glad that it was.It makes me sad to hear that Harrison Ford has never won an Oscar. He should've at least won for The Fugitive, or, in my opinion, Raiders of the lost ark. His performance as Indiana Jones is funny and, in an un-gay way, rather charming.The plot is pretty basic. Henry Jones Jr., a.k.a. Indiana Jones(Ford) is a professor, and, well, a badass archaeologist. He is sent to retrieve The Ark of the Covenant, which, as you know, was a biblical item. Not only does he have to save it, but he has to save it, but he has to save it from Nazis. So its a race against the clock as Indy, Marion(Karen Allen), Indy's old fling, and Sallah(John Rhys-Davies) try to retrieve it.There comes a Summer movie that is just a lot of fun, filled with nice locations and thrilling action sequences. A good example of that is Romancing the stone or, most recently Knight and day(i'm not comparing it to Raiders of the lost ark but I did think it was a blast). You look at a movie like Knight and day and you remember what blockbusters used to be like.Raiders of the lost ark is really what films are made of. It's hard to find a film more adventurous than anything Indiana Jones appears in. Raiders of the lost ark is somewhere on my top ten favorite films.

But when it's good it's real good. Reeling off a number of memorable and often chilling scenes, film is further boosted by the psychological smarts in Roos' (Boys on the Side) screenplay. It helps that Schroeder has a knack for pacing, too, where he neatly simmers the plot until the spill over for the big finale. No disappointment there either, a good combination of genre staples is enhanced in impact by some unexpected character developments, and there's moments of genuine suspense to lure the viewer to the edge of their seat. It's also stylishly shot by Schroeder and Tovoli (Suspiria\/Tenebrae). Allie's Upper West Side apartment is imposing and expansive, with high ceilings, old time plumbing, a clunky lift and a dingy laundry in the basement. It's a different set-up for such a thriller, no picket fence harmony house or beach side residence, this is bustling New York, big spaces, but as it turns out, that means no hiding place. The boys behind the cameras get the maximum they can from the locale by blending imposing and ominous with grainy veneer and filtered light. On the acting front, the girls put great effort into making their thinly developed characters work, with Leigh doing a good line in progressive instability. While Friedman, Weber and a wonderfully naughty Tobolowsky, make the most of their secondary roles.

The boys behind the cameras get the maximum they can from the locale by blending imposing and ominous with grainy veneer and filtered light. On the acting front, the girls put great effort into making their thinly developed characters work, with Leigh doing a good line in progressive instability.

It stars Bridget Fonda, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Steven Weber, Peter Friedman and Stephen Tobolowsky. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Luciano Tovoli.When it's revealed that her partner Sam (Weber) has been cheating on her with his ex-wife, Allie Jones (Fonda) kicks him out of the apartment and advertises for a female roommate. She chooses Hedra Carlson (Leigh), who on the surface seems to be the perfect roommate. Smoothly helping Allie through her crisis, a real friendship is formed, but it's not long before Hedra starts to exhibit some dark behaviour patterns&#x85;..The early 90s saw the Woman from Hell back in vogue in mainstream cinema. After the success and publicity of Fatal Attraction (1987), there was a period where you feel that sensible film makers wisely chose to let that particular film disappear from the film lovers memory banks. As it happens, they must have collectively chose 5 years as the cooling off period. For 1992 saw a wave of mad female on the loose pictures released. Led by the publicity gobbling Basic Instinct, films such as The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and Single White Female put bums on cinema seats and reopened the Mad Bitch sub-genre. Of the three, Single White Female grossed the least, which is strange since it's a better movie than the other two.Schroeder's (Barfly\/Reversal of Fortune) movie isn't a complete success, there's not enough development of the main characters and there's some unintentionally funny moments. But when it's good it's real good. Reeling off a number of memorable and often chilling scenes, film is further boosted by the psychological smarts in Roos' (Boys on the Side) screenplay. It helps that Schroeder has a knack for pacing, too, where he neatly simmers the plot until the spill over for the big finale. No disappointment there either, a good combination of genre staples is enhanced in impact by some unexpected character developments, and there's moments of genuine suspense to lure the viewer to the edge of their seat. It's also stylishly shot by Schroeder and Tovoli (Suspiria\/Tenebrae). Allie's Upper West Side apartment is imposing and expansive, with high ceilings, old time plumbing, a clunky lift and a dingy laundry in the basement. It's a different set-up for such a thriller, no picket fence harmony house or beach side residence, this is bustling New York, big spaces, but as it turns out, that means no hiding place.

It's the sort of film that some will think is the cat's meow while others will despise it like it's a child molester and both points of view will be valid. That's because while this movie is well done, what it does is so blisteringly ordinary. Just about anyone who watches it will have moments of emotional recognition for what's going on in the story and most will spend the time in between those moments plaintively waiting for the talking and walking to go anywhere.Amelia (Catherine Keener) is a single woman in New York City. She has a lifelong best friend named Laura (Anne Heche) who's now living with a boyfriend (Todd Field). Amelia doesn't have a boyfriend. She does have an ex-boyfriend named Andrew (Liev Schrieber) who hangs around like Cosmo Kramer from Seinfeld. Amelia's also got a cat dying of cancer and a video store clerk\/horror movie fan (Kevin Corrigan) who wants to bone her.As soon as Laura's boyfriend proposes to her, she starts fancying other men. As soon as Amelia gets comfortable with settling for the video store clerk, he dumps her for saying he's ugly behind his back. Andrew has a father with Alzheimer's and a pseudo-girlfriend in California whom he wants to dump right after he has phone sex with her. Amelia feels abandoned by Laura not always being there for her and Laura can't always be there for her because she's actually gone out and gotten a life of her own.Now take all of that and coat it with 2 ½ inches of well written but mostly inconsequential blather and you've got Walking And Talking. It'll work for you if you like the performers, enjoy having a waterfall of very short scenes splash over you and appreciate examinations of humanity in utterly unexceptional circumstances. It'll feel like a potato peeler across your forehead if you want characters that are likable, need a story to have some propulsion and don't want to watch a motion picture that's less interesting than your own life.Catherine Keener does a wonderful job playing a woman you really wouldn't want to know. Anne Hech is as good playing a woman you would want to know but would have a love\/hate relationship with. Liev Schreiber is okay, except for the fact that Amelia and Andrew's relationship is written as though Nicole Holofcener has never met a man, let alone dated one. Ex-lovers can certainly break up and still find a way to be friends. That way is not going to be like it is here, where Amelia treats Andrew like her gay best friend and Andrew behaves like he's her gay best friend. That's an odd way for ex-lovers to relate and requires a lot more explanation than it gets in Walking And Talking.Which is a complaint that could be levied against much of this script. While the film is already too long as 86 minutes, the story feels like significant parts of it are regularly being skipped in order to show you scenes that would normally be cut out of a film to tighten it up. None of it's bad, but you can't help thinking there's something more important you should be seeing.If you like dramas where the drama is muted, comedies where the comedy produces more knowing grins than giggles and romances where you don't particularly care if the lovers get together or not, give Walking And Talking a try. If you can take pleasure from craft for its own sake, give Walking And Talking a try. If you want a movie that doesn't remind you of the inane conversations you've had with your own friends, find something else to watch ","genre":null},{"date":"26 August 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Walking And Talking is a lot more talking than walking.

It should be a separate movie, and was obviously added by the studio to keep American audiences from feeling depressed at the end of the Japanese victory on Hawaii. Maybe a good business decision, but it was a poor dramatic decision.The 1944 movie 30 Seconds Over Tokyo, with Spencer Tracy as Doolittle, already covered this story, although thankfully without trying to mix it with a silly love triangle. In several ways the old movie outdid the new one, mostly because it didn't use some of the terrible techniques that are spoiling so many movies for me these days. The main thing it avoided is the constant use of quick cuts, one camera shot replacing another after only a few seconds, supposedly to increase the sense of excitement. Unfortunately, it detracts from much of the pleasure of watching this kind of movie, the kind of thing I always enjoy, such as prolonged views of the aircraft and the carriers, the views from the air, a chance to look around and see some of the background details that may be completely miscellaneous but which add to the sense of reality, even if they're not exactly what the director wants us to focus on. The audience can also see that the real purpose of a lot of quick cuts is sometimes to hide things from us, to avoid showing a plane really gunning its engine for a while, trying harder and harder to get up to full power, then taxiing and taking off a short runway, for example, or a real view of Tokyo from the air. Pearl Harbor certainly does offer a lot through the use of computer graphics, but even then it does so only in fits and starts, in scenes that flash by too quickly to enjoy. In 30 Seconds Over Tokyo we fly with the crews for several minutes over the wave-tops toward Japan, the engines roaring in our ears, while in Pearl Harbor the trip is done in a couple of quick cuts.

In fact, it is to Paris where the director always flies to whenever he goes to Europe because from there he gets himself into his European mood.Although there were other cities in the tour, only a few places are showcased in the documentary.

A ride on a gondola makes Mr. Allen seasick. In Milan, the couple is given the biggest suite at the Principe di Savoia Hotel, something that create a problem for the director because of its vastness, and for Soon-Yi because of the lack of hot water in the showers. Mr. Allen has a few quirks. He will always have an extra room in order to have privacy in his bathroom. His laundry must be done just so. His nostalgia for New York, a city where he can function freely, is challenged by the new places he visits. The worst part of the tour is Rome because of a stiff crowd that seemed to have gone to the concert because it was included in the price of dinner.Ms. Kopple has a rare treat for her fans for last. As Woody Allen and Soon-Yi come home, they are visited by his parents. His mother, a vivacious lady with a no-nonsense attitude, is not impressed by the trophies, the mementos her son received during the trip. Her ambition in life was for her son to be a pharmacist. It would have been a dream come true for her, that, and a nice Jewish girl for him. Alas, neither of those wishes came true.The material for the documentary is excellent.

Barbara Kopple, a director that has made a name for herself in this type of genre, tails a notorious man whose neurosis has translated into many films about himself. Woody Allen has been on the scene for quite a while now. He has enjoyed a long career, but actually the focus of the tour is not about the filmmaker, but about the closet musician he is at heart.We are taken aboard the private jet that is taking him to Paris. He is accompanied by Soon-Yi Previn, his wife since 1997. His sister Letty Aronson, who is connected with Mr. Allen, having produced most of the films her brother has directed, has also come along. The first stop is Paris, a city Mr. Allen deems one of the most beautiful in Europe. In fact, it is to Paris where the director always flies to whenever he goes to Europe because from there he gets himself into his European mood.Although there were other cities in the tour, only a few places are showcased in the documentary.
