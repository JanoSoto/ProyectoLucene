The script by Trey Callaway is your basic teen slasher that were all the rage after the success of Scream (1996) although I Still Know What You Did Last Summer has a very serious tone rather than the light hearted one seen in Scream, one of the reasons I liked this is because it reminded of all those old classic slasher films from the 70's & 80's. While most of these films stuck to a simple premise they were pretty popular which is why so many were made I suppose & I Still Know What You Did Last Summer evoked memories of them for me, it's got the thunderstorm, the isolated cut off location, a cool hook handed killer who takes no nonsense, it's got some nice kills with decent amounts of blood & even though it's silly & improbable & they don't always work perfectly I rather liked the twists & turns which added that little something extra to the overall story. On the down side it also retains many of the problems with those early slasher films, the story is a bit one dimensional to say the least, the cast of young American teens are annoying especially Brandy's character who I'd have paid good money to see die, there are the usual fake scares & highly questionable coincidences which do stretch the films credibility to breaking point at times. It certainly moves along at a nice pace, I was never bored, while not the most gripping film ever I did actually want to follow it through & over it's 100 odd minute duration it entertained me & just for the record I also liked the really silly & cheesy ending scene.Director Cannon does fine, I think there's a decent atmosphere here & you can almost feel the warmth of the sun from some of the location shooting. I thought there were a few reasonably effective scare scenes & I have to say I really liked the way it's shot with regular muted soft colour schemes. There's some good gore as well, the killer gets to use his hook by sticking it in peoples hands, slashing their throats, dragging people across the floor with it embedded in their flesh, he sticks some garden shears in someones chest, there's a machete stuck in someones head, people are impaled on a harpoon & someone has the hook shoved through their throat.With a supposed budget of about $24,000,000 I Still Know What You Did Last Summer has that Hollywood polish about it & it's well made throughout although there is one scene which always bugs me because it could have been rectified so easily, it's at the end when Julie is firing a Colt revolver which holds 6 (count them 6) bullets & she fires at least 8 shots which is psychically impossible because 8 doesn't go into 6, obviously. Surely someone could have noticed this & just edited the scene down so she fired 6 instead of 8? The acting is alright, Hewitt is OK but that Brandy, urgh! It was nice to see Jeffrey Combs in a small role too.I Still Know What You Did Last Summer seems almost universally hated by just about everyone, that makes me even more pleased to try & balance things out a bit & confirm to a curious world that here are indeed film-goers out here that enjoy I Still Know Whay You Did Last Summer warts & all & if you don't like it sue me!

Family ties become the ties that bind or the start of a civil war.This film really hits home for me. The creative force behind it took a genre (vampire films) and combined it with that 1980s youth mentality to produce a vampire film that will stand the test of time. Richard Donner was supposed to direct (he had previously worked with Haim\/Feldman on Goonies) but handed control over to Joel Schumacher. I have no real love for Schumacher, but he did something wonderful here and I can't help but commend him for that.The supporting cast is also great. Kiefer Sutherland (who has gone on to great things) and Alex Winter (who went on to make Freaked and then disappeared). Edward Herrmann plays Max, the mother (Dianne West)'s boyfriend. I have a fond memory of seeing this film for the first time at my friend Jodey's house and having another friend comment, I bet that guy drives a Lexus (due to Herrmann being a Lexus spokesman at the time). The memory still cracks me up.The cast and crew are great, but three things deserve some attention music, comics and mythology. The music was great, to say the least. The use of the Doors People are Strange was nice. I don't like the Doors, but that's okay because Echo and the Bunnymen were kind enough to do a cover. There's even a large Jim Morrison poster in the vampire's den (which really seems odd, but alright). The best song is what I would call the theme which has children singing thou shall not... which is played at key moments to tug at the audience emotionally. I was moved, I won't lie. It's not even a good song, but it fits.The comics were a nice touch. Whoever wrote this (and I apologize I can't recall offhand) loved vampires and loved comic books, because they knew how to balance the two perfectly. Not only is a comic a driving medium for getting the word out on vampires, but there is just a comic book undercurrent that connects the primary protagonists. I was an avid collector in my youth, but I was certainly not as informed as Haim or Feldman on the specific nuances of old school Batman or Superman issues.Last, the mythology is amazing. Most horror films, and vampire films in particular, can be judged by the way they represent the source material. This movie addresses mirrors, garlic, sunlight, holy water, getting invited into residences and stakes through the heart. In some areas they deviate from the classical traditions, but do so in such a respectful way that this seems all the more perfect (any deviation has a plausible explanation -- it's not just merely thrown out the window). Being traditional and new at the same time is hard, but mastered here.If you see only only Haim\/Feldman film, see Goonies. If you see two, see this one. (If you see three, see License to Drive or Dream a Little Dream, I guess.) And if you see only one 1980s vampire movie, see this one. I can think of no other film that appeals to both children and adults while staying both serious and light-hearted, classic and modern. Besides, you'll never see Kiefer Sutherland with hair like this again.

In giant yellow letters were reviews saying wittyand laugh-provoking and so I naturally thought the film would be a comedy. Well, to me it really wasn't. I did laugh once very briefly--and a small laugh at that. Now this ISN'T meant as negative criticism--the film's makers were not responsible for how it was mismarketed. The movie still worked for me as a romance but only once I let go of my expectations and forced myself to watch through the first 20 or so minutes (which were pretty slow), I found the movie interesting and different--something that occurs too seldom with films. I wouldn't strongly advise a person to seek out the movie, but it's a harmless diversion.The main theme of the movie is mismatched pairs. Mr. Castella is in an unhappy marriage and most of this seems to be because his wife hates people--making herself a lousy partner. The one laugh I had was when this terrible woman's dog bites a passerby. Instead of showing any sympathy, she blames the man! Then, you find out her dog bites people all the time but it's always the victim's fault! Mr. and Mrs. Castella go to a play and Mrs. Castella talks through much of the play and finds fault with everything. Mr. Castella usually hates the theater but is mesmerized by the performance of one of the actresses--the same lady who is also his English language tutor. Mr. Castella spends much of the movie trying to hang around this actress and her bohemian friends--even though he really has nothing in common with them and appears to have no chance with the lady.There are a couple parallel plots that also have to do with mismatched couples. One is Mrs. Castella who tries for once to reach out to another person--in this case, her estranged sister-in-law. Another involves a drug-selling lady who works in a bar and is pursued by a conservative man! All these relationships are difficult, if not impossible to believe. Some work out, some do not. Despite me NOT believing the old axiom that opposites attract, the film is clever and well made--with very believable and low-key acting by people who act like real people. I respect the film a lot--though I didn't find myself thrilled enough to understand how it was nominated for the Best Foreign Film Oscar.

It has an amazing cast, a pleasant light way of storytelling and a cleverly written story, featuring some great stereotypical gangster-type of characters.So, ever wondered what would happen if gangster interfered with producing Hollywood movies? See Get Shorty if your curious about the result. It's an unusual original story about tough gangster put in an unnatural environment, who thinks that are making movies is the same as any other criminal activity.The movie is cleverly written with many different characters, that all follow one and the same plot line. All characters have different motivations but they are all cleverly connected to each other. The many characters often mix and meet each other in the events, which also causes all of their motivations to mix. The movie is really cleverly written and executed. It perhaps sounds like a complicated and hard movie to follow but it really is a light, great written and pleasant one to watch.The movie also works because of the many fine characters and of course the actors that portray them. Basically every character in the movie is deliciously stereotypical, from the Hollywood-producer to the stunt guy and from the successful acclaimed Hollywood actor to the mobster boss. The movie is well cast with actors that are obviously not cast because of their comical talents but purely because of their acting skills. The cast is one to kill for. John Travolta of course knows how to play a cool and likable gangster. Gene Hackman also plays one of his most fun roles as low-budget Hollywood producer, who thinks that he is going to make it big time. Danny DeVito is great as an Hollywood-actor and Dennis Farina, Delroy Lindo, Miguel Sandoval provide the good gangster parts of the movie. David Paymer also does what he can do best; playing a guy with a hat.

The many characters often mix and meet each other in the events, which also causes all of their motivations to mix. The movie is really cleverly written and executed.

Basically every character in the movie is deliciously stereotypical, from the Hollywood-producer to the stunt guy and from the successful acclaimed Hollywood actor to the mobster boss. The movie is well cast with actors that are obviously not cast because of their comical talents but purely because of their acting skills. The cast is one to kill for. John Travolta of course knows how to play a cool and likable gangster. Gene Hackman also plays one of his most fun roles as low-budget Hollywood producer, who thinks that he is going to make it big time.

Also, the title was vaguely familiar - hmmm, did it have a good rep but I had never seen it?So I taped it (it was on at 2 a.m. on a network station) and finally got around to watching it. Loved, loved, loved this movie! And that's coming from me, a hater of teen horror flicks. First, there's the distraction, when you don't know what film you are watching, of all the 'Oh, Bebe Neuwirth! Oh, Josh Hartnett! Oh, John Stewart! Oh, Usher! Oh, Salma Hayek!' etc., etc.' when you really aren't expecting much. Then there are no distractions as the movie zoomed along steadily, dropping clues, setting up conflicts only to have alliances shift and new conflicts reveal themselves.One reason I never watch teen horror flicks is the pace is too regular. It's as if the director and writer can't gamble letting 3 minutes go by without someone dying a gory death to some telegraphic music.There wasn't too much of that in this movie. I was surprised when Josh Hartnett's character took off with one of the aliens in the back seat. In a cheesier movie, there would be a cut to some other fast and furious slasher action to sort of bring up the intensity. There was just enough time in the wild car scene to keep your attention while you didn't have enough time to ponder how he was going to dump the alien. I liked the tired looking high school and the ordinary houses the kids lived in. None of that 'we're living in Ohio but the houses came from Sherman Oaks.'This movie did everything a movie is supposed to do - entertain. When I saw that it was a Robert Rodriguez film, there was an 'A HA!' moment because this is just what I thought his film 'El Mariachi' accomplished - it entertained. After the movie ended, you had that satisfied feeling that you had been amused and involved and sat on the edge of your seat sometimes.Good flick! That's high praise for this genre.

The only difference is I actually liked the movie, primarily because it plays as an incredible piece of imagination rather than as any kind of shocking, deep philosophical statement.The film works best as this is our world rather than forbidden love. The sense of isolation, of familial insularity is all-pervasive, probably due to Derek being the only adult character of any consequence. Both mother and father are so faintly delineated that there's no real sense of loss when they both die. Scenes where the children reflect back on them have no real power since the parents were hardly there to begin with. In fact, the film works better if you start it around 11 mins. This creates the feeling that the father has been dead for quite some time rather than very recently. The characters lack of emotional reaction to his being gone makes more sense then. Likewise the mother's illness becomes something that has been going on for a significant length of time, so that when she too dies, it doesn't change much--the children have already adjusted to living w\/o her.I could go on in a similar vein as there's so much which doesn't really make a lot of sense when looked at too closely. What makes it work is the kind of otherworldly shimmer Birkin gives the story. It frees the viewer up from having to parse it for cues to deeper meaning in the real world, so that we can get a feeling of what it's like to live in a very obsessive, very small world where your older sister is a disturbing little tease and your brother is a 15yr old version of Jim Morrison.Aimless-46's review touches on Birkin's artsy pretentiousness, and yeah, it's definitely there. Fortunately, Birkin is so inept when it comes to symbology that it works in the film's favor. The flashbacks to the beach scenes were probably meant to be something very specific, but they're presented in such an uncoordinated manner (and at such random points in the narrative) as to be utterly mysterious, heightening the sense of disconnection from reality. Then there's the voice-overs (in a Saturday morning cartoon announcer's voice) of the cheesy space novel Jack is reading, which should be really weak attempts at ironic commentary, except for the quoted passages seem to have nothing to do with the Jack\/Julie storyline. Or, in fact, anything in the movie at all. And, of course, there's the Naked Jack in the Rain scene, possibly intended as ...well, I have no idea. Something metaphysical, I suppose, although the way it's shot it seems like little more than cooling off in the rain on a hot sweaty night.Birkin (following Macgowan's lead in the book?) appears to be trying to say something profound about gender, but it's laughable, which gives the movie some needed levity at key moments.

Julie dressing the youngest boy Tom up as a girl comes off not as a statement about gender identity, but rather as a hint that Julie has an actual sense of humor. Jacks's discovery of Tom, wearing a ridiculous wig and playing at husband and wife with his friend William, underlines Jack's essential cluelessness. Even after Tom informs him that they're playing at being Jack and Julie, Jack doesn't seem to get it.

And her swirly patterned form fitting dress. She doesn't walk. She glides! On a mission to assassinate the President. And gets sidetracked by Martin Short's sex starved Press Secretary. Its a wonderfully witty scene, with a real appealing sense of deadpan humour. And Lisa Marie carries it all off without uttering a single syllable.

The solution to stopping the Martians is a bit odd, but it fits in with classic B-movie clichés.But overall, Mars Attacks is a disappointment. Its a bloated, over-inflated production with too many cast members. You're actually grateful when the Martians start blowing people away, because it shortens the cast list and tightens the focus.

The story revolves around Ruby Baker (Leelee Sobieski, Joy Ride), whose parents die in a horrible car accident. Scarred from the incident, Ruby and her brother, Rhett (Trevor Morgan), move in with their previous long-time neighbors and friends, Terry and Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsgaard and Diane Lane), in their luxurious glass home located in the hills on the California coast. Things seem normal enough at first, although Ruby isn't used to their kind of lifestyle - the Glasses can buy them literally anything they want. Rhett has a new Playstation and plenty of games, and Ruby is given a brand new Mac laptop, just to name a few of the items they've received. But the more time she spends at the house, she begins to realize that things aren't all cop-acetic, and that Terry and Erin aren't quite as friendly as they may appear, and that they might be holding a dark secret related to Ruby.While it is an admittedly predictable teenage thriller, The Glass House still manages to be consistently entertaining despite it's clichés and shortcomings. The storyline isn't anything too original - teen moves in with seemingly-friendly adoptive parents who may have ulterior motives. The same type of thing has been done before, so in that respect this film doesn't offer much of anything new. Is it clichéd? Yes, it surely is. Despite that though, it does have some nice touches to it and is never uninteresting at all. The way the story begins to unfold is predictable, and I knew what was going to happen next before it even happened, but I was still interested and entertained with it. But a large majority of films are predictable - doesn't mean they can't be enjoyable though.There is some nice cinematography in the movie, and the glass house itself is really an amazing set piece. Reflections, lightness, and darkness are all used in conjunction with the glass walls, and create an eerie atmosphere for the movie at appropriate times. The movie does lack real scares, but it's more of a thriller than anything so I suppose that's irrelevant. Just don't go in expecting it to be a full-blown horror movie, because it's not at all. The cast is led by Leelee Sobieski, and she is good enough to carry the film. Stellan Skarsgaard and Diane Lane play the two-sided foster parents, who are both friendly and menacing, as their characters should be. There are a few other familiar faces in the cast as well, including Trevor Morgan as Rhett, and Kathy Baker as a counselor\/social worker. The acting in the film is overall pretty good. The movie's conclusion, as is a lot of other things in this film, is predictable, but it's satisfying as well so I can't really complain too much about it.The bottom line is, if you're tired of the typical teen thrillers out there, then you'll probably want to skip The Glass House.

No empty filler, meaningless beyond its superficial appeal for the shallow, short attention span crowd. What you will find is a marvelously constructed film that will be appreciated and admired by a mature and serious audience, particularly those who are hungry for a substantial gourmet meal in a sea of cheap, seemingly endless junk food. This is one of those rare moments in a production when every role, from actor to editor, was filled by just the right person. If anyone is a serious student of acting, film making, or play production you can't ask for a better study tool than this film. Every actor was perfect for his role, even Kevin Spacey, who I always find has a contrived acting undertone to his work but that quality is perfect for the tight a*sed character he plays. And what can you say about the other roles other than brilliant, certainly these performances all rank among the top of each actor's resume. This is also David Mamet's best play, the most tightly written, polished and textured. He is certainly the serious actor's writer, no one writes more textured and honest characters using real dialog that fits together like an intricate, well oiled machine. My only complaint with him, though, is when he directs. He has said that the actor is only there to read the lines as written, claiming all the emphasis of any production should be based on the writing. Well as you can clearly see elsewhere, great writing can get butchered by a bad production and many a so-called great films have just been great executions of mediocre scripts.

No empty filler, meaningless beyond its superficial appeal for the shallow, short attention span crowd.

This is one of those rare moments in a production when every role, from actor to editor, was filled by just the right person. If anyone is a serious student of acting, film making, or play production you can't ask for a better study tool than this film. Every actor was perfect for his role, even Kevin Spacey, who I always find has a contrived acting undertone to his work but that quality is perfect for the tight a*sed character he plays. And what can you say about the other roles other than brilliant, certainly these performances all rank among the top of each actor's resume. This is also David Mamet's best play, the most tightly written, polished and textured. He is certainly the serious actor's writer, no one writes more textured and honest characters using real dialog that fits together like an intricate, well oiled machine. My only complaint with him, though, is when he directs. He has said that the actor is only there to read the lines as written, claiming all the emphasis of any production should be based on the writing. Well as you can clearly see elsewhere, great writing can get butchered by a bad production and many a so-called great films have just been great executions of mediocre scripts.

The two Stone films I truly like are JFK and Talk Radio, yet Talk Radio takes the cake for being Stone's finest achievement. Stone is a director whereby you are either a fan or you are not, it is safe to say that before watching Talk Radio I was not fond of the guy and considered one of the most overrated directors in the film industry, though after watching Talk Radio some of my perceptions have changed. Talk Radio is an unsettling and amusing attack on what is now known as reality TV.Talk Radio follows a self-indulgent, dysfunctional, determined, hysterical, outrageous and perplexing radio host, named Barry Champlain who hosts a controversial late-night radio show in Dallas. Quickly becoming well known for his bold and quirky air-presence he becomes a late night sensation, whereby depraved junkies, delinquents, racists, sociopaths, sickos, perverts and morons call in to be ridiculed on air. The film shows the rise and fall of the man's career, carefully making an accurate portrayal on freedom of speech. Originally adapted from a stage-play, the film attaches itself to the theatre theme that it was originally built around, wonderfully conveying the film's fierce nature.With the ferocious energy and non-stereotypical air, Talk Radio brings all the hilarity behind crass media. It remains even more poignant today than it was in the late '80s. The film goes into depth studying the likes of arrogance, self-obsession, offensive behaviour, controversy, hypocrisy and ignorance. The film shows through a controlled manner how it is good to have a personal opinion and freedom of speech, yet it is something that should be used wisely rather than shamefully blunt. Stone tries to show how freedom of speech is a crucial importance in life, but is something that we should be wary and cautious about. The film asks the question of is our main protagonist just the same as the sad people who call up the show? Stone fabulously creates the film's key set-piece (the radio station) with an ambition and cold atmosphere. He then succeeds in capturing the isolation, fear, ambiguity and the dangerous emotions that are built up at the radio station. Eric Bogosian is perfectly cast as the isolated, self-absorbed and complex genius, Barry Champlain. He fits the role perfectly letting off his lines with such enthusiasm, urgency, perplexity, brusqueness and ultimately the bold hilarity of his offensive nature. The performance brims with spark, which was evidently robbed of an Oscar nomination. His voice suits the character, being that a primary element of a radio host and his power of acting along with tragedy and comedy works brilliantly.There is a strong use of editing in Stone's films and Talk Radio boasts some of his cleanest, most rhythmic editing. He uses beautifully controlled camera techniques, which differ from being calm to suddenly becoming turbulent. There is a vibrant energy behind the film, with its raw and wonderfully delightful script working as a centre-piece for the greatness of the film. The striking and virtuous cinematography stands out in the moments inside and outside the studio, most impressively capturing the city at night. Not forgetting the hauntingly heartbreaking and yet darkly funny climatic spiral to decline is ultimately remarkable cinema.Talk Radio is an essential modern masterpiece, I am certain you will be surprised by just how great it really is. I highly recommend Talk Radio for anyone interested in media or film. Talk Radio is a fine example of top-notch, intellectual and insightful entertainment, which still packs a well-earned wakeup call. Finally, if it was not for Eric Bogosian the film would not be the fun, delightful and enduring masterpiece it is today.

The other main problem is the script. While it is a very good idea to begin with, there is more than one time when it borders on laughable. That never helps a horror film.

Was happy to have found the DVD yesterday. Watched it again and was equally amazed by the huge amount of over the top details and twists. I remember watching it, not knowing what I was looking. missed the first ten minutes I think. So it was only until after the end I was enlightened about Dan Aykroyd playing both the judge and one of his creepy grandsons. That discovery only added to my delight about this movie. Because it was yet another surprise. And this film is full of twists and surprises. It keeps getting wackier and wackier. Every time you think you got everything down something happens that you couldn't have imagined. It gets gross, it gets creepy and definitely uncomfortable, it gets absurd. --SMALL SPOILER-- For example The party that has been arrested is offered a dinner (this sounds nicer than it actually is). First they serve grey looking big sausages. Then the middle of the table changes into a model train track and you can't believe they actually made that. Then the train starts to run by with all kind of sauces like ketchup, mustard etc. The judge, who looks really awful, demonstrates in a very distasteful way how to add ketchup to your sausage. It makes you feel nauseous. And just when you think you've had it, there is a shot of Chevy Chase looking at the judge's nose and he sees the glans of a penis. --END OF SPOILER-- Maybe I have a strange sense of humor or enjoy movies for a different reason than most people, but I really liked the creativity, the attention to detail, the surprises, the over the top story, and the nice finale. The set designers must have had a vivid fantasy because there are some set pieces that are truly incredible (all kinds of gadgets, but also the exterior of the judge's house). I think Dan Aykroyd is brilliant as the judge. I would say all other parts are supporting roles. I would put this movie in the same category as Shaun of the Dead. A kind of horror-comedy-adventure. Although I think Shaun of the Dead includes more belly laughs. And the comedy in Nothing but Trouble is more dark. If you're looking for a National Lampoon kind of comedy, skip this movie. But if you expect a very strange, creepy, over the top, dark-comedy with some horror elements that makes you feel uncomfortable at times and laugh with anxiety at other times, this is for you.

Then the train starts to run by with all kind of sauces like ketchup, mustard etc. The judge, who looks really awful, demonstrates in a very distasteful way how to add ketchup to your sausage. It makes you feel nauseous. And just when you think you've had it, there is a shot of Chevy Chase looking at the judge's nose and he sees the glans of a penis. --END OF SPOILER-- Maybe I have a strange sense of humor or enjoy movies for a different reason than most people, but I really liked the creativity, the attention to detail, the surprises, the over the top story, and the nice finale. The set designers must have had a vivid fantasy because there are some set pieces that are truly incredible (all kinds of gadgets, but also the exterior of the judge's house). I think Dan Aykroyd is brilliant as the judge. I would say all other parts are supporting roles. I would put this movie in the same category as Shaun of the Dead. A kind of horror-comedy-adventure. Although I think Shaun of the Dead includes more belly laughs. And the comedy in Nothing but Trouble is more dark. If you're looking for a National Lampoon kind of comedy, skip this movie. But if you expect a very strange, creepy, over the top, dark-comedy with some horror elements that makes you feel uncomfortable at times and laugh with anxiety at other times, this is for you.

Was happy to have found the DVD yesterday. Watched it again and was equally amazed by the huge amount of over the top details and twists. I remember watching it, not knowing what I was looking. missed the first ten minutes I think. So it was only until after the end I was enlightened about Dan Aykroyd playing both the judge and one of his creepy grandsons. That discovery only added to my delight about this movie. Because it was yet another surprise. And this film is full of twists and surprises. It keeps getting wackier and wackier. Every time you think you got everything down something happens that you couldn't have imagined. It gets gross, it gets creepy and definitely uncomfortable, it gets absurd. --SMALL SPOILER-- For example The party that has been arrested is offered a dinner (this sounds nicer than it actually is).

The only thing I found weird about it is that it had all the things in the movie in a snowflake they had humans decorations creatures in a snowflake.

Eraserhead is as magical as Cocteau, as visually impressive as 2001, as unnerving as Poe. Its also David Lynch's purest work, an uncompromising vision of depression. This is personal film-making at its most extreme. For an hour and a half, you are stuck in Lynch's bizarre yet complex mind. What Eraserhead means is completely open to debate. Its one of those rare surrealist films that, even if its actually about nothing, you are convinced it is a metaphor. No other film has received as many interpretations as this one. Eraserhead certainly isn't for everyone. Many will either be made uncomfortable by its unrelenting strangeness or bored (sometimes both). However, those who want to be confronted by cinema, and view it as a potentially transcendental form (as opposed to simply entertainment) need to step up to Eraserhead's challenge.Oddly enough, unlike many other art and surreal films, this isn't a cold and uninvolved experience. I have suffered from depression issues in the past, and make a supreme emotional connection with Henry every viewing. Also, while the film is unrelentingly grim for the most part, there are bits of absurdest humor that reveal themselves more and more upon every subsequent viewing (I've found this to be a trademark with Lynch films). For a film with such a low budget, Eraserhead appears to have much more scope than it actually does, mainly because of the range of the film. Nothing else I have seen so resembles a half-remembered dream, Eraserhead is one of the most poetic films ever made in America. Its not just a freak-show or self-indulgence, its a truly beautiful film.

It's been on my must see list for so long, and I shall give myself a severe telling off for being so tardy. I've just watched Children of Men, director Alfonso Cuarón's latest movie, and been totally blown away by it, so I thought I should catch up with his earlier works.There is a line in the film where one character says Mexico breathes with life. Well, so does this film. It's entertaining, life affirming, funny, wistful without being sentimental and features the almost unbearably cute Gael Garcia Bernal. Bernal and the excellent Diego Luna (as Julio and Tenoch) are two young men with too much time on their hands. They take off on a road trip across Mexico with an older woman Luisa (Maribel Verdu, with a body to die for) while their girlfriends are in Europe.Luisa is nursing the hurt of discovering she has an unfaithful spouse, but by the end of the film we discover she has deeper reasons for escaping from her life in Mexico City and heading to the coast with her two new young friends. The boys are trying to impress her when they tell her about their secret beach, but after traveling through the grinding poverty of Mexico's hinterland, they do actually find a place at the coast which is beautiful and unspoiled, where life is still lived with grace. But not for long, as we discover that this place too is about to be redeveloped for tourism. Along the way, Luisa seduces both boys - whose rampant sexuality dominates the film wonderfully &#150; trying to show them more adult and arguably more satisfying ways to make love.The movie is beautifully acted and perfectly filmed and edited. It says quite a lot about teenage sexuality, male and female, and it shows a side and depth of Mexico not seen on the average 5 day vacation package. I loved it.
