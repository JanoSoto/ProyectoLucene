Brad Pitt does a nice job of playing an inhibition-to-the-winds bad boy who sports leather and sunglasses at night, and looks like a champion even when bleeding profusely while getting his face punched in. He takes the character played by Edward Norton away from his menial office job, and starts a life in which Norton can take out his frustrations, and live on the edge by beating the daylights out of other similarly hopeless men. The trouble comes when Pitt starts giving homework to the fighters. The group starts to become more of a criminal organization. Pitt then begins a program called Project Mayhem, recruiting members of the Fight Club, making them even more tough than the beat-downs of the Fight Club had made them, and initiates a program of urban terrorism. Pitt's repeated mantra is that he and his gathered army are the lowest of the low. They have lost all hope, do not fear death, and are stronger for it. The real twist comes when (ready? Here it comes&#133;) Pitt and Norton turn out to be the same person. This poses a very interesting situation, as Tyler (the character's name) struggles with himself to figure himself out, and to prevent the mass terror Pitt has planned. The climax comes when Norton shoots himself in the head, and kills Pitt. Miraculously Norton survives, and watches ten credit card buildings downed by homemade explosives. That's everything that is apparent to the viewer. With that in mind, I found the scenes where Pitt fought Norton to be ruined, as I realized that Norton was actually kicking his own butt. However this got me thinking about the reality of the entire film. The film was so fantastical and unreal that it is in fact possible that it was not a film about urban terror, and beating the stuffing out of others, but was about the internal struggle of one man. A man plagued by insomnia, and living in a world in which he could not tell reality from dreams.It's a movie about personal struggles. Struggling with fear, self-loathing and desire. It was such an intense choice of theme, that it was often times difficult to figure out. However a couple things were clear. One was that those who have lost all hope are the strongest of all, because they have nothing left to fear. Another was that fear is a burden on all of us. It is what keeps us from doing what we truly want to do. And it's true. Fear of something is the ultimate impediment in our lives. The key is to let ourselves go, and to embrace pain as a learning experience. Then we can be who we want, and do what we want. Similarly, fear should be embraced, and should be used as a driving force. At one point Pitt points a gun to convenience store clerk's head, and orders him to become a veterinarian (like he had wanted to be in his youth) or else Pitt would kill him. This was one of those action movies that was fun to watch, albeit gruesome at times. It was visually exciting and a tickling comedy as well. It wasn't cinematographically amazing, but it wasn't boring in that sense. When is comes to a message, it got it done also. It knew what its main message was from the start, and it got it out there as well. However the crowning jewel of this film was the way the intricate and bizarre plot was worked flawlessly into the main idea, to create a seamless film. If this film leaves you with a raised eyebrow, and an inquiring mind, it did its job. But give it a chance. And remember, if it doesn't make you think, it's not worth your time. -Michael ","genre":null},{"date":"19 April 2006","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" An action film that makes an effort, like every movie should, at giving a life message.

I'll just focus on the differences here and on some things that I found charming and some not so charming 1. I don't know if it was done intentionally, but Hanks' character is a typical workaholic of our day and age, a yuppie and someone totally dependent on consumerism. So I found myself feeling a slight satisfaction when he was cast away. I was kinda going Let's see what you do now, Mr. Career-Driven Corporate Employee CEO of Fedex Wannabe. I am sure the makers of this movie had no intention of creating such a blunt statement to the extent I am suggesting, but I felt it that way.The question here is What do you do if you have nothing except yourself? When you're not Mr.X, with a social status and every bit of your outer world disappears and you are left with nothing but yourself? Now the solution of our hero, going through pain, anguish and suicidal thoughts is to hold on to his past. Here is the major difference to Robinson Crusoe. Robinson finally adapts. Our hero never really does, even though he does manage to create some kind of inner balance not without the help of one of the most beautiful characters in movie history the volleyball Wilson. Their relationship is extremely touching.2. The emotions of the character are strong and presented eloquently and in an elegant manner to the viewer. You really feel with the character. The only flaw of the movie, in my opinion, is that it's just a bit too picturesque. Sure, some gritty realism - like the pulling the tooth out scene,but sometimes too picturesque. Fortunately the incredible versatility and excellent casting of Tom Hanks covers most of that and really touches you.3. As for the coming back sequence and the ending...very very nice. Lots of great acting and storytelling here and the conclusion is definitely appropriate and consistent with the character development. Great final frame with the crossroads. Only one observation (in the sense of What would I do in the same situation?) I would have definitely have opened up the package and adapt like Robinson C. (at least I feel so). The fact that our hero never manages to really adapt is a statement of our fragility as a social animal.The fact that he needed that unopened package to be finally delivered as a way to keep his sanity all those secluded years is a sad reminder that it is extremely hard to be really free from your outer world. Robinson Crusoe was written centuries ago, in the classical\/pre-romantic period of literature, in a time when, it seems, there was a lot more confidence in the ability of man to live at peace with himself. I am not sure whether I am more like this Fedex guy or Robinson, but I would definitely prefer Robinson.Anyway, Bravo! Tom Hanks and let's hope Zemeckis will make THIS kind of movies as opposed to his usual obnoxious content-free block-busters.

I don't know if it was done intentionally, but Hanks' character is a typical workaholic of our day and age, a yuppie and someone totally dependent on consumerism. So I found myself feeling a slight satisfaction when he was cast away. I was kinda going Let's see what you do now, Mr. Career-Driven Corporate Employee CEO of Fedex Wannabe. I am sure the makers of this movie had no intention of creating such a blunt statement to the extent I am suggesting, but I felt it that way.The question here is What do you do if you have nothing except yourself? When you're not Mr.X, with a social status and every bit of your outer world disappears and you are left with nothing but yourself? Now the solution of our hero, going through pain, anguish and suicidal thoughts is to hold on to his past. Here is the major difference to Robinson Crusoe. Robinson finally adapts. Our hero never really does, even though he does manage to create some kind of inner balance not without the help of one of the most beautiful characters in movie history the volleyball Wilson. Their relationship is extremely touching.2. The emotions of the character are strong and presented eloquently and in an elegant manner to the viewer. You really feel with the character. The only flaw of the movie, in my opinion, is that it's just a bit too picturesque. Sure, some gritty realism - like the pulling the tooth out scene,but sometimes too picturesque. Fortunately the incredible versatility and excellent casting of Tom Hanks covers most of that and really touches you.3. As for the coming back sequence and the ending...very very nice. Lots of great acting and storytelling here and the conclusion is definitely appropriate and consistent with the character development. Great final frame with the crossroads. Only one observation (in the sense of What would I do in the same situation?) I would have definitely have opened up the package and adapt like Robinson C. (at least I feel so). The fact that our hero never manages to really adapt is a statement of our fragility as a social animal.The fact that he needed that unopened package to be finally delivered as a way to keep his sanity all those secluded years is a sad reminder that it is extremely hard to be really free from your outer world. Robinson Crusoe was written centuries ago, in the classical\/pre-romantic period of literature, in a time when, it seems, there was a lot more confidence in the ability of man to live at peace with himself. I am not sure whether I am more like this Fedex guy or Robinson, but I would definitely prefer Robinson.Anyway, Bravo! Tom Hanks and let's hope Zemeckis will make THIS kind of movies as opposed to his usual obnoxious content-free block-busters.

This is Pulp Fiction, one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen.Just after seeing the first story, which stars John Travolta and Uma Thurman, I was satisfied with the movie. The second (and the best) story, with Bruce Willis, made me understand that the movie deserved a 5\/5. Add another story, with Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, and you know that Pulp Fiction is simply perfect and a revolution into the film industry.What impressed me the most is the structure of the movie. Even before the opening credits appear, you assist to a conversation between a young man and his girlfriend who decide to rob the restaurant in which they eat, because it would be an easy job. They both shout Hands up!, just when director Quentin Tarantino cuts the scene starts the credits and then shifts elsewhere. Vincent (Travolta) and Jules (Jackson) are about to meet their boss Marcellus (Ving Rhames), but they meet other guys and the scene (that I baptized scene A) ends tragically, but not for everybody.The first story begins. Vincent and Mia(Thurman), Marcellus' wife meet each other for a drug trade. They go to a 50's drive-in and they participate into a dance competition, which they win. It shouldn't be surprising, when the dance man is John Travolta. It's clearly visible that he hasn't buried the Grease and Saturday Night Fever days. But the story ends less happily as Mia overdoses herself and Vincent brings her to the dealer who sold him the drug. In order to re-animate Mia, Vincent has to perform into the most shocking scene I've ever seen.Cut to the second story. Young Butch is given his deceased father's gold watch by Capt. Koons(Christopher Walken). Actual Butch(Willis), a boxer, wakes up from this dream and goes to the ring. We never see a single scene from the combat, but the radio announcer tells that Butch fought his adversary so hard that he killed him. Unaware that he actually killed his opponent, Butch flees to the motel where his wife Fabienne waits for him. Fabienne forgot Butch's watch and the boxer goes back to his home to get it. But he discovers a gun on his oven and at the same moment, Vincent goes out from the bathroom. Instinctly, Butch takes the gun and shoots Vincent to death. Butch flees in his car and Marsellus appears in front of him. Butch runs over Marsellus, but the boss wants Butch's head and he pursuits him to an electronic store. Both men are taken hostages by the salesman and the sexual-obsessed policeman on the scene. They're able to free themselves. Butch kills the salesman with a Japanese sabre, while Marcellus shoots the policeman into the genitals.My God, this is something entirely new for the violence genre! This is some kind of depiction and exaggeration of today's everyday violence and it's absolutely awesome. The aggressiveness and the violent instinct, as well as the sexual needs make the characters intriguing and fascinating, if not frightening. In their minds, violence is neither funny, nor dramatic. Violence has just lost its signification and it becomes the only employable language into their world. This world has lost of its logic and moral working, turning itself into a savage jungle filled of barbaric people.The third story begins with the scene A and its followings. Vincent and Jules bring a friend into their car. During the ride, Vincent inadvertently shoots him and the vehicle is filled of blood and a corpse lays on the back seat. Vincent and Jules visit a friend, Jimmy(Tarantino), and try to find a solution. Soon, Winston Wolf(Harvey Keitel) arrives and tells them what to do. The following scenes are filled with drama, as well as extreme-black humor. Vincent and Jules decide to take breakfast in a restaurant, but the place they chose is about to be taken over by robbers. So, the first scene of all superimposes itself. What follows is images of drama, as well as this ultra-violence and that taste for anarchy and robbery.Pulp Fiction is simply a classic. Its revolutionary structure and stories make it twisting and intriguing and the characters that we see here are only superficial, especially the main ones. Jules takes violence as a simple aspect of life and his religious chats are somehow special. Butch is a soul-tortured boxer who acts like violence was as normal as breathing. The drug use and the sexual situations into the movie may be controversial, but they're just other elements from a mad world, in which violence, absurdity and foolishness are the order of the day.

Filling us in on how they know this would only slow the film down.What amazes me most about this film, besides the fact the two heroes are fired upon at least 500 times and get hit once, where every shot they make hits their targets with dead on accuracy, is that this is another movie where a guy treats a women with total disrespect, kidnaps her and does nothing to make him like her, she knows him for about two days and doesn't want him to go for some reason. It's like a reality show where the contestants have known each other for two days and one person always says I love you guys. Except there's no reality in this show.

'Moonraker' is one of those entries which is very far removed from your standard spy film and from it's opening sequence of a space shuttle theft blowing up a 747 to the gloriously over the top laser gun climax, it wears its colours proud; this is James Bond as an action franchise with tongue lodged firmly in cheek.Whether you enjoy it the first time you catch it on one of the multitudes of Bond seasons that frequent television schedules these days then will depend on your mindset at the time. If for example you believe that Bond begins and ends with that Scottish man that everybody does impressions of then this isn't going to be the movie to change your mind. In Roger Moore's defence though, he is more than competent in the role and should be celebrated for playing the character his way, rather than trying to copy his predecessors. His version of James is like a public schoolboy on a round the world trip who also happens to be a deadly assassin; all double-entendres and raised eyebrows allied to a ruthless killing efficiency. Interesting to note that he only fires one gun in the entire movie, but just look at how he does it - effortlessly dispatching a would-be hit-man before nodding an arrogant gesture of triumph at Super Villain Of The Week Drax.However, if you're ready for a bit of mindless escapism with plenty of bad one liners (I think he's attempting re-entry sir), large explosions and beautiful women then this is certainly a lot more entertaining than some of the horrific misfires that would dog Brosnan's post-Goldeneye jaunts. Barely ten minutes elapses between set pieces before our man in the tuxedo finds a new way to get into peril and some of them are excellent. His bull-in-a-china-shop brawl with a Japanese martial artist in the middle of an art gallery for example is a riot, the two combatants smashing priceless artifacts to pieces with such reckless abandon there's barely time to question why Drax's henchman has brought a wooden sword to the fight. And then there's Jaws. Oh yes, Jaws. Richard Kiel returns for his second and final time as the metal-toothed and indestructible giant and though he manages to speak only four words in the entire movie, he is still one of the most memorable aspects, his facial expressions summing it all up. Just look at those bulging eyes and the slack jawed terror when his speed boat first pitches over the side of a colossal waterfall, or his frantic attempts to fly when a parachute fails to open. Kiel is nothing less than a scene stealer all the way through and while some may moan about him becoming more of a slapstick foil this time around, just check out the moment where he advances in a carnival costume down on a dark alley on one of his foe's numerous lady friends; cold and evil menace made reality.In short then one of the most riotously-enjoyable entries in the franchise. It's not a classic by any means and the fun factor hinders that status as much as it helps it, but it's still a worthy entry.

Her role has been compared to that of Scarlett O'Hara in GONE WITH THE WIND but the only similarity would have to be their gender; otherwise, these are two very different women, O'Hara being an irrepressible, flighty tease, Garance being well aware of her position in society and unwilling to give that up for love.Love is coincidentally, what guides the plot of CHILDREN OF PARADISE. Every main player in the story is in love with who he or she cannot have. Arletty herself is depicted in the way she can only be seen as Truth, gazing at herself coldly through a mirror she holds in her hands, sitting in a water tank -- an image of surreal beauty closer to Dalinian art. She is merely an illusion for men, carnal desire that can offer only suggestions and emotions of the moment, but who is, as she herself states later on to Baptiste's young son, alone. Baptiste is the mime who defends her against a charge of theft and is repaid with a rose. He falls in love with her just like that, and from then on, he can't think of anyone else but her. The thing is, once he has the chance to consummate his love -- he bypasses it, and at this point, she accepts the advances of an aspiring actor, Frederic Lemaitre.But Frederic would rather be loved by the theater, so he also can't give himself entirely to Garance.

That said, it prevented me liking it more even when I see its value -- with performances that may come a little mannered here and there, but is in tune with the times and styles of acting in the first half of the 20th century. It does retain a novel approach to its story in which conflicts remain unsolved, Garance has a marvelous, protracted exit from the screen amidst a crowd, and I was left with a sense that even when the story seemed a little choppy here and there, it was one that would linger on due to its stately beauty.

Göran lives in communal house called the Together commune and as such things are a bit different from what Elisabeth, Eva and Stefan are used to. Elisabeth seems to take to the fun adult lifestyle easily but with no TV and no normal structure, Eva and Stefan struggle, with Eva spending a lot of her time sitting outside in the van while Stefan seems determined to get back to his father. However as time goes by the dynamics of the commune start to shift due to the presence of the family.Although I wasn't sure what this film was going to be about at first I found myself drawn into it on the grounds of it being nicely comic without mocking its characters to the degree that the audience loses the ability to take them seriously or have an interest in them. As such the film works well because it treads this fine line and finds things to like and mock on both sides of the society that we see being formed within the house. Parts of it are funny but generally it is comic and engaging at the same time. If there is a moral then I suppose it is that no one group is right and that happiness and peace is easiest found in the middle ground rather than in the extremes (no matter how worthy they seem); this message is clear and it is nicely woven into the story that sees both extremes comically picked away to leave a final scene of simple pleasure and togetherness. It sound corny but I was surprised by how expertly Moodysson delivered it &#150; keeping the emotional core while also producing laughs and characters that if you met them in the street you would hit! The cast do well to work within this and I was impressed by the fact that they mostly avoided caricature. It is hard to pick out one performance because the whole film is very much an ensemble piece but if only for avoiding the horrid cute kid performances so beloved by Hollywood, Samuelsson and Kessel deserve praise. Generally everyone gets the tone of the film and produces performances that are comic without hating themselves. Moodysson's direction took a second to get the hang of (with its zooms and movement) but I quickly got into it and it did suit the material by drawing the audience into the house (even on my small TV it worked!).Overall this is a slight but enjoyable film that is as comic as it is engaging. It is not hilarious and it is not dramatic; suitably enough, it sits somewhere in the middle ground but works well by doing so. The plot is simple but the writing makes it more than it seems as it charmingly delivers a solid moral. It may frustrate some viewers looking for a nice traditional narrative but this is an engaging and amusing film that works on several levels and is well worth seeing.

Göran lives in communal house called the Together commune and as such things are a bit different from what Elisabeth, Eva and Stefan are used to. Elisabeth seems to take to the fun adult lifestyle easily but with no TV and no normal structure, Eva and Stefan struggle, with Eva spending a lot of her time sitting outside in the van while Stefan seems determined to get back to his father. However as time goes by the dynamics of the commune start to shift due to the presence of the family.Although I wasn't sure what this film was going to be about at first I found myself drawn into it on the grounds of it being nicely comic without mocking its characters to the degree that the audience loses the ability to take them seriously or have an interest in them. As such the film works well because it treads this fine line and finds things to like and mock on both sides of the society that we see being formed within the house. Parts of it are funny but generally it is comic and engaging at the same time. If there is a moral then I suppose it is that no one group is right and that happiness and peace is easiest found in the middle ground rather than in the extremes (no matter how worthy they seem); this message is clear and it is nicely woven into the story that sees both extremes comically picked away to leave a final scene of simple pleasure and togetherness. It sound corny but I was surprised by how expertly Moodysson delivered it &#150; keeping the emotional core while also producing laughs and characters that if you met them in the street you would hit! The cast do well to work within this and I was impressed by the fact that they mostly avoided caricature. It is hard to pick out one performance because the whole film is very much an ensemble piece but if only for avoiding the horrid cute kid performances so beloved by Hollywood, Samuelsson and Kessel deserve praise. Generally everyone gets the tone of the film and produces performances that are comic without hating themselves.

Truly bad films are a special pleasure for me because they allow you to examine your limits in ways that the cozy ones don't.

Fleeing the city, he kidnaps Memnon's sorcerer Cassandra (who he is also meant to kill) and heads into the desert.

The plot is essentially a collection of action scenes held together by some overly-serious plot with a bit of flesh and titillation thrown in just in case the teens get restless. It is very derivative and very obvious and, if you are actually paying much attention to it then you'll find it pretty tiresome at times.

The only reason I didn't rate it higher is that I was hoping for more scenes with Robin & Marian together, as opposed to the men's exploits. The movie relates Robin's story from an unusual perspective, not as the legendary dashing young archer & outlaw, but as an aging hero with some physical infirmities, making him all the more appealing. But Robin Hood still has some fight left in him...The much older Robin has returned from the Crusades to Sherwood Forest, accompanied by his faithful friend and constant companion, Little John. His old love, Marian, is by this time a nun, in fact the Mother Superior of an Abbey. Politically, King Richard the Lionheart and his brother, Prince John, are basically greedy idiots and definitely no asset to the peasants. Robin's old nemesis, the Sheriff of Nottingham, is as menacing as ever, and Robin must again summon a band of loyal followers (including his old cohorts, Will Scarlett and Friar Tuck) to protect the innocent from the Sheriff's tyranny.The two stars are perfect in this mature love story, with its dramatic ending that I won't give away here. Sean Connery makes a sympathetic and compelling but weary hero, as Robin comes to grips with his aging, his physical limitations, and his mortality. Audrey Hepburn with her ageless beauty is radiant, dignified, and graceful as Marian. The pair are absolutely beautiful together on screen.Actually, the most engrossing relationship in this film might just be between the two old adversaries, Robin and the Sheriff of Nottingham, who form a sort of bond and develop mutual respect. Robert Shaw is absolutely perfect in his role as the Sheriff, who seems almost sympathetic & honourable here, not quite his usual completely villainous self. Their struggle culminates in a dramatic sword duel. Another relationship well developed is the one between Robin and his faithful friend, the gentle giant, Little John, who is portrayed by Nicol Williamson. Richard Harris plays the malevolent King Richard, though I am uncertain as to the historical accuracy of the depiction.This movie has beautiful cinematography and musical scoring. Though Robin is no longer the daring young adventurer of old, this story is much more compelling than some other adaptations, notably the vastly inferior Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, starring Kevin Costner.

They stumble into the motel room of the drunken Muddy Grimes &#150; small time arms dealer and low-life criminal. Mistaking them for some hired killers, Muddy gives them tickets to Las Vegas so they can do his wife, Dallas. Enticed by the chance to have sex and get paid for it, Beavis and Butt-Head accept the offer and head off. In Las Vegas they meet Dallas, who twigs to their confusion and sends them on to Washington with the promise of more sex; however before she lets them go she puts a stolen biological weapon into Beavis' pants. The two continue their journey, unaware that the full authority of ATF Agent Hurley is hot on their heals.I only tried the Beavis and Butt-Head TV show a couple of times and must confess that I never really got into the humour of it. So when the movie came out I just left it till it came to TV for free. When it did I was surprised by how amusing it was &#150; rarely hilarious but it had enough silly humour and imaginative story telling to drive it forward for the comparatively short running time. It is still an acquired taste but I quite got into it because it had a good pace and was a mix of material &#150; not just B&B doing their thing. Some have said that the story is good but I think it is better to say that it is silly and fun with just enough going for it to call a structure. The laughs are not free flowing but even not being a fan I found it silly and fun. It helps that the scenarios are good and mimic other genres to good effect &#150; playing some of them straight while placing the madness of B&B in the middle of it all.The animation is basic but effective but it is the voice work that adds value. Judge is good in all his roles and as creator of the whole shooting match. Willis and Moore are good sports even if their presence is their material and they shape the plot rather than really produce good humour. Stack is excellent, more or less repeating his straight-talking performance from Airplane to good effect. Small roles for Bogosian, Letterman and a few others add value and some amusement.Overall then a pretty amusing film that has a good structure within which to place the B&B madness. It isn't hilarious and it won't be to everyone's taste but I enjoyed it and found it to be entertaining and distracting, with more than enough clever touches to carry it from start to finish. Not brilliant then, but worth a look if you know the pair and are in the mood for this type of silliness.

Enticed by the chance to have sex and get paid for it, Beavis and Butt-Head accept the offer and head off. In Las Vegas they meet Dallas, who twigs to their confusion and sends them on to Washington with the promise of more sex; however before she lets them go she puts a stolen biological weapon into Beavis' pants. The two continue their journey, unaware that the full authority of ATF Agent Hurley is hot on their heals.I only tried the Beavis and Butt-Head TV show a couple of times and must confess that I never really got into the humour of it. So when the movie came out I just left it till it came to TV for free. When it did I was surprised by how amusing it was &#150; rarely hilarious but it had enough silly humour and imaginative story telling to drive it forward for the comparatively short running time. It is still an acquired taste but I quite got into it because it had a good pace and was a mix of material &#150; not just B&B doing their thing. Some have said that the story is good but I think it is better to say that it is silly and fun with just enough going for it to call a structure. The laughs are not free flowing but even not being a fan I found it silly and fun. It helps that the scenarios are good and mimic other genres to good effect &#150; playing some of them straight while placing the madness of B&B in the middle of it all.The animation is basic but effective but it is the voice work that adds value. Judge is good in all his roles and as creator of the whole shooting match. Willis and Moore are good sports even if their presence is their material and they shape the plot rather than really produce good humour. Stack is excellent, more or less repeating his straight-talking performance from Airplane to good effect. Small roles for Bogosian, Letterman and a few others add value and some amusement.Overall then a pretty amusing film that has a good structure within which to place the B&B madness. It isn't hilarious and it won't be to everyone's taste but I enjoyed it and found it to be entertaining and distracting, with more than enough clever touches to carry it from start to finish. Not brilliant then, but worth a look if you know the pair and are in the mood for this type of silliness.

","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"19 April 2006","score":"","review":" This is perhaps Seagal's best film. It has a great story, and the best cinematography out of any of his earlier films (I haven't seen the Direct To Video ones). The casts performance is all A-grade. Seagal, and CSI's Marg Helgenberger have wonderful chemistry together.If you want to see a movie with heart (and a message), you can't go wrong with Fire Down Below. Don't get me wrong, I love Seagal's traditional neck breaking, bone cracking, and all...but as I get older, films like this become more enjoyable, and rewarding. Regardless the criticisms this and On Deadly Ground have received on being preachy\/kind of preachy...I give Seagal credit for at least trying to give a damn about the world we inhabit. I can't think of too many action stars (with his popularity at the time) that would've been bold enough to tackle the subjects he preached about head on. I'll end by saying, Fire Down Below was the beginning of Seagal the Actor (not just Action star). I just don't know what happened...maybe bad management or loss of vision on Seagal's part, (maybe both...maybe neither). I'm just proud to have this film apart of my collection.Kudos to Director Félix Enríquez Alcalá for filming a magnificent piece, Jeb Stuart for writing a wonderful story.

Little Shop of Horrors is one of those movies.Based on the hit off-Broadway musical, which was based on the schlocky Roger Corman movie of the same name (but if it's so schlocky, why do we all love to watch those movies?), Little Shop of Horrors is a movie that could have gone wrong in a million different ways, but in the right hands, it is a thoroughly entertaining experience. Directed by master Muppeteer and brilliant comedy director Frank Oz, the be-bop music, talking plant, romance, humor, and creepiness all work together in unison, something that would not seem likely on paper.The story is somewhat of a fairy tale, albeit a twisted one, about a down and out guy (Rick Moranis) and a down and out girl (Ellen Greene) who wish for a happy life beyond Skid Row, but are forced to live a miserable existence in a ramshackle flower shop. But the discovery of a very unusual plant brings unexpected business, unexpected fame and fortune, and one very unexpected problem, because this plant seems to have a very particular appetite. . . .Rick Moranis and Ellen Greene (who incidentally originated her role in the off-Broadway play) make for charming and thoroughly sympathetic leads (I never knew Rick Moranis could sing!). And Steve Martin is hilarious in the minor but certainly unforgettable role of the sadistic dentist. But Mr. Martin is only one of several comedic cameos in the film, including Christopher Guest who gives a hilarious performance as the flower shop's first customer, Bill Murray as the masochist patient, and a few other surprises.Alan Menken, who is probably best known for his work with Disney on Beauty and the Beast, Little Mermaid, etc., and Howard Ashman present yet another dazzling musical score that sticks in your mind well after the movie is done. And a big round of applause must go to the plant itself. Remembering that this was made in the days before CGI, you will be floored by this live animatronic creature. But really, this is a movie that cannot be explained. You just have to experience it yourself!
