The way the characters bounced off walls, walked and then jumped off of the water, even running up and down trees and their branches, all was breathtaking and was none other than the actors on wires instead of the tired old usual CGI. The characters give riveting performances.  The cinematography is exceptional. The fights surpass any other, even the Matrix and Enter the Dragon. The love story really was effective and credible unlike most action-fantasy films that simply place these elements into the plot to give it a heart.

After seeing how these people in this hospital, in the Bronx, who suffered from this terrible disease were only able to live almost their entire lives' in the brief summer of 1969, I seriously thought about my life and just how fragile it is. When the character Lucy says, I know it's not 1926, I just need it to be, and how she's living in a 69 year old body, with only the life experience of a 22 year old; my heart just aches. How sad it must be to go into a comatose state at 22 during the Roaring Twenties and wake up at the end of the Age of Aquarius in an elderly body, with no memory of the years in between. I'm so glad this movie was made, and made so well. Bravo Penny Marshall.Robert DeNiro is amazing in this film. Leonard's story is so particularly poignant because he fell under this illness as a child, waking up at middle age, having never experienced his teens or young adulthood, and more importantly, true love (which he begins to experience through his child-like curiosity with Paula (Penelope Ann Miller-who is also excellent)). This may be a spoiler so beware--but when Leonard has to accept that his awakening is coming to an end and he has his last dance with Paula, I was in tears. The relationship between Leonard and his mother is also very emotional. She's spent her life taking care of her invalid son, never knowing if he can hear or see her. The way Robert DeNiro portrayed his character's rapid maturity (which he never got to experience in real time), is so superb that he deserved that Oscar nomination 100%. Robin Williams is also outstanding, keeping his usually exuberant sense of humor subdued to play Dr. Malcolm Sayer. You can feel his sense of confusion at trying to get the hospital administration to allow him to try this experimental medication on these patients. It's heartbreaking when he has to finally say goodbye to Leonard, who has a difficult time dealing with the rapid progression of the disease at the end of the summer after the medication is no longer effective.

China will definitely be high on my list of places to have the next vacation. The music score was fantastic. The drum beat was unbelievably effective in complimenting the furious action.

Ridley Scott, who directed one of my all-time favorites, Blade Runner, almost never misses. But few directors can ever hope to hit the mark so cleanly and convincingly as Scott does with Gladiator. Gladiator is magnificent, thrilling, moving, epic, heroic and a dozen other things so conspicuously absent in so many movies and so abundantly present here.Russell Crowe was born to play this role, and he occupies the character with epic vigor and a presence that has a tendency to overpower a scene. It is, of course, true that Crowe's ego made him nearly impossible to work with, and he is said to have proclaimed during filming that he was the greatest actor in the world. There are, in fact, moments in the film where it would be difficult to argue with him. Still, he has subtle moments as well. There is a scene, late in the movie. Maximus is near the end of an epic struggle and all the contentious forces of Rome are whirling around him. He is asked by Lucilla, the emperor's sister, with whom he apparently had an affair years ago, if all that had happened made her seem different. Crowe replies, with stunning understatement, You laughed more. I knew in that moment that Crowe had won the Oscar®, and deservedly so. The story is, quite simply, largely fabrication, though to some extent based on fact. It is true that Commodus was the only Roman emperor to fight in the Coliseum, although his battle with Maximus, as well as its magnificent conclusion, is entirely fictionalized. In fact, Maximus Decimus Meridius is a completely fictitious character perhaps composited by screenwriter David Franzoni and director Ridley Scott, who clearly gave themselves full literary license to rewrite the relatively common story of Commodus into something breathtakingly memorable.Hollywood has been in the movie business a long time. There are many great movies, but few are great on the scale of Gladiator. Every aspect of Gladiator comes together so spectacularly that any shortcomings it may have are easily overlooked. Scott's inspired direction, Hans Zimmer's thrilling score, supplemented by Lisa Gerrard's stirring vocals; all conspire magically to contribute to Gladiator's success. John Mathieson's cinematography, which Scott relied on in Robin Hood and Hannibal as well, is painterly and dark, perfectly matched to the story and characters. There are movies of the genre, towering achievements in cinema from decades past, held in higher regard than Gladiator, but in many ways even they are not Gladiator's equal. Gladiator is not only a peer to the likes of Spartacus and Ben Hur, but, ultimately, their superior. And for the curious, or the skeptical, I would put the Battle of Carthage scene up against the Chariot Race scene any day. Perhaps it isn't as disturbingly, agonizingly long, but the heroism and courage played out in the Carthage scene is without equal. A few of the common problems with epic films are necessarily present. Some of the characters are not fully developed, which, given the story arc, is common in epic films which are based on events rather than subtle characterizations. As for historical inaccuracies, much cited in derision of the film, I don't think Scott is presently seeking an endowed chair in History at any major university, so if he took a few liberties with a well-known story to heighten the drama, I can only reply with a quote from the main character; Are you not entertained? The lore surrounding Gladiator is definitely fascinating. Oliver Reed, who died during principle filming, had to be recreated digitally in some scenes. Despite the difficulty of this effort, it was less expensive than refilming Reed's scenes and many of the cast insisted that Reed remain a part of the film. Richard Harris is rumored to have refused to learn rewrites, complicating his scenes early in the film. In both cases, their immense contributions to the film make it all worthwhile. Scott's signature touches, a washed-out color palette, the ubiquitous slow motion splattering of blood, and, most notably his tendency to magnify characters by using tight close-ups against backgrounds compressed by the application of telephoto lenses, may have been a bit overdone, but the combined effect heightens the action, the drama and the characters and somehow imbues them with a sense of history fitting the story.In short, Gladiator may be the best sandals and swords epic ever, and a worthy heir to the mantle handed down from its predecessors. Russell Crowe is glorious as the brooding and relentless gladiator bent on revenge. Joaquin Phoenix is electric as the devious and ambitious Commodus, and without a doubt should have received the Best Supporting Actor nod. With Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, sadly both now deceased, added for flavor, this is as great an epic as any. So many reviewers want to dislike movies that are popular, as if it proves that they are gifted with an appreciation of fine cinema that escapes lesser moviegoers. I say nonsense.

Sorry, but I despise Michael Mann for ruining two of my favorite books, Red Dragon and The Keep.  He should stick to making music videos and Miami Vice retreads.  That is the only think he can do.  There is talk that DD is going to remake the film. Maybe we'll get a good one this time.Silence of the Lambs.  Some style, some substance.  Enough to get nominated for several Oscars but not too much to win, like with Sixth Sense.? Anyway, After Manhunter tanked at the box office, DD sold the rights to SOTL.  Jonathan Demme and Ted Tally who did an excellent job of bringing the book to the screen although I think they ultimately chose the wrong road in making the film more about Buffalo Bill and less about Hannibal and Clarice. There were many wonderful moments left out of the movie altogether. Ultimately the film was slightly timid.Hannibal.  The pinnacle of both style and substance - indeed more than many people were willing or able to take.  Rather like Dr. Lecter's favorite red wine Chateau Petrus.A little background...A while back, Thomas Harris released a book that attempts what many considered to be impossible stepping out from behind the shadow of a great work - in this case, Silence of the Lambs.  Now he knows how Pink Floyd felt when they were making Wish You Were Here.  But I digress...Harris writes Hannibal and delivers more of everything we loved about SOTL which, in turn, delivered more of what we (those of us who read it anyway) loved about Red Dragon.  Hannibal had more atmosphere, more power, more Hannibal Lecter, more arcane references to high culture (how many people tried Chateau Y'Quem or white truffles after reading about them in Hannibal?) and more of Harris's delectable prose.The result?  Critics blast it and many readers felt betrayed.  Why? Because they didn't like the ending.  Why?  Because they felt it was unrealistic or that the characters wouldn't have behaved that way.  I couldn't believe my ears and eyes.  I'm sure Harris felt the same way.  Let me say a couple of things about that.  First, Thomas Harris is the author.  Capice?  That means the caracters do what he wants them to do.  Second, I believe it was George Bernard Shaw who once said something to the effect that truth was stranger than fiction because fiction had to be believable and the truth suffers from no such contstraint.In my opinion, Thomas Harris delivered what was fiction but with the power of truth when he gives us a denouement that is both chilling and profoundly disturbing but also utterly unpredictable.  Isn't that the mark of good storytelling?  To give us something that rattles our cage *and* takes us by surprise?  And, for the people who don't believe that Starling would have done what she did...  Did you *read* the ending or just gloss over it? Harris explaines clearly why Starling is doing what she's doing and why.

That means the caracters do what he wants them to do.  Second, I believe it was George Bernard Shaw who once said something to the effect that truth was stranger than fiction because fiction had to be believable and the truth suffers from no such contstraint.In my opinion, Thomas Harris delivered what was fiction but with the power of truth when he gives us a denouement that is both chilling and profoundly disturbing but also utterly unpredictable.  Isn't that the mark of good storytelling?  To give us something that rattles our cage *and* takes us by surprise?  And, for the people who don't believe that Starling would have done what she did...  Did you *read* the ending or just gloss over it? Harris explaines clearly why Starling is doing what she's doing and why.

Now, I love most Disney films I have to admit, and I am not going to pretend that this is THE best but it's certainly one of them, up there with Beauty and The Beast and The Lion King, so anyone who says that this film is no good, has obviously not seen it! The despair that we see in Ariel's face as she watches her beloved Eric announce his engagement to Ursula (of all people) just shows why this film has stood the test of time, and I can guarantee that any child who likes Disney now, if shown The Little Mermaid, will go the swimming pool twice as often as before and start trying to swim like Ariel, or sing like Ariel, or dream of finding their very own Eric! I could sit here and compliment the animation, and the direction, and the voices, and the music of this film until I am blue in the face but I would still not account for the most important thing that gives this film that little extra........and that's the magic of Disney. The magic of make believe and wonder, and that feeling you get when you are a child of how anything can happen. You really get this feeling from The Little Mermaid, a feeling you don't get from other Disney films, like Bedknobs and Broomsticks, or (to some extent) Mary Poppins.

The results of his experiments are more than he could have hoped for. Before long he starts hallucinating during the hours out of the experiments and during brief periods of time after the experiments he is transformed to these earlier versions of humankind, even all the way back to the primordial ooze.Unfortunately this side of the story enters the movie too late. The first 45 minutes we are watching Jessup rant and rave about religion and philosophy like there is no tomorrow, but unfortunately this is not as compelling as the second part of the story. When Jessup goes into one of his first hallucinatory states, the viewer is bombarded with a visual and sound explosion. The visuals are of such a level that they can be explained in any number of ways, which hinders the movie. Some scenes just take way too long (sandfigures withering away).The acting is decent. Hurt delivers a potent performance of the man who undergoes all these experiments. His convincing portrayal is what upholds the movie. His wife Emily (Blair Brown) must love him very much, because she endures Hurt's atrocious personality to the end in the name of love. The sceptic Mason (Charles Haid) was just too much, he resisted the experiments with such fervor that it became laughable and certainly not believable, his performance would have benefited from a more subtle approach.When I said that the story about halfway turns for the good, I didn't mean that it ended good as well. On the contrary, all the credit that was built with the change in story halfway was thrown away in the last fews minutes when the conclusion all becomes muddled and incomprehensible, and that was a shame.The special effects were nice enough to see, but not remarkable.

If that is the case, do not fret it, just go with the flow.  There are worse things that you could call them after certain movies, like Goodfellas or Reservoir Dogs.I think when I was about ten or twelve or fifteen, my wonder years, my only concern was to see the latest film by Spielberg or the latest sequel to First Blood and of course any number of one syllabled, one liner Arnold movies.  I only wanted to see films that I recognized.  When I was about fifteen, I dated a girl named Marnie, who worked at the local theater in Forest Glade in Windsor Ontario.  This was convenient because not only was she pretty but she could get me into movies for free.  This is the summer that I became quickly hooked on movies.  I loved them before, but now I was addicted.  The problem was, the only films I was privy to at the time were films like Rambo, Commando, Secret of My Success, Burgler and so on.  These were all films that I enjoyed thoroughly and they acted as somewhat of a catalyst for me to see some other films that perhaps normally I would avoid.  I can remember seeing David Lynch's Blue Velvet and then films like The River's Edge or even straight to video bombs like Zandalee.  It doesn't matter if these films were good or not, the point is that as I grew in age, my taste and insatiable hunger for films of all types grew.  I was finally ready to see the not so prime time films, the ones that may have a budget of less than $30 million.  I began to appreciate films like Boyz N The Hood, Clerks, Reservoir Dogs, El Mariachi and of course Swingers.  Swingers is a film that if you were pretty much into mainstream films ( in 1996 of course ), you may avoid.  There were no real stars in this film.  It was a film made for $200 000, and it didn't have explosions, car chases and a fight scene every five minutes.  That is why films like this make 4 million dollars at the box office, there is no mass appeal to them.  But when you can find a film like this on video, it makes you appreciate film for all the positive aspects of it.  It makes you appreciate the fact that there are people like Jon Favreau, Doug Liman and Vince Vaughn.  These are people that seem to love what they do and it is exemplified perfectly with Swingers.  That is not to say that you can't enjoy films like True Lies, Titanic, Forest Gump, Hannibal and any other big budgeted Hollywood film because you can, but sometimes the best films out there are films that may not find a true audience until it hits video.  Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino can lay claim to that fact and so does Doug Liman and Jon Favreau's Swingers.  This is one of the best films to come out of 1996 and it was made for 100 times less than Titanic.  Swingers is about breaking up, how hard it is to break up, films and the Hollywood scene, friendship, guys, swing dancing and so much more.  Jon Favreau plays Mikey, who has just moved out to California because his girlfriend of six years dumped him.  He has been single six months but still checks his messages every day to see if she has called.  He checks them so frequently that one morning while his friend Trent ( in a fantastic comedic performance by Vince Vaughn ) is in the middle of scoring with a cocktail waitress, he has to use the only phone available, the one in the bedroom.  This scene is perfect but the scene to follow is even better.  Mikey apologizes to Trent for ruining his good time and Trent replies,Don't worry about it Mikey.  I just wanted to get you out and show you a good time.or something to that effect.  Friendship is important to these cast of characters.  That is evident when Mikey's best friend Rob, who has also moved out to L.A. from New York, is the only one that Mikey really seems to be able to talk to.  They share some very real and passionate scenes together and their talks about making it in Hollywood and learning to let go of the past are some of the best written scenes in any film.  This is work similar to the candor and starkness of Smith and Tarantino.  While there are times in this film when you will laugh yourself silly because of the realistic absurdity of some of the characters, you will also find yourself in awe with some of the honesty.  Jon Favreau is a gifted writer and as they say, you should write with what you are familiar with.  Swingers exemplifies the fact that he is very familiar with trying to break into Hollywood and how it feels to have the love of your life break up with you.  There is also a very clever scene where he is talking to his ex and she tells him that she is dating a guy named Pierre.  Is he french, Mikey wonders out loud to her.  She tells him that he is not and I wonder if Favreau ever had that same question posed about himself with his last name.Not only is Swingers a wonderful film about the mysteries of women, it also has two incredible homages to Reservoir Dogs and Goodfellas and without even knowing it, Halloween as well ( Goodfellas and Halloween share a very similar shot.  Halloween at the beginning, Goodfellas in the restaurant ).And of course what has to be mentioned about this film is the language used by everybody.  Friends tell each other that they are gorgeous, that they are money and they refer to each other affectionately as baby.  It is so catchy that when I watched this with my fiancee she was in hysterics after five minutes and we were calling each other money for the next three days.Swingers is one of the best films of 1996.  People that hold the lofty position of revered film critics and Academy members should realize these sorts of facts.  While perhaps films similar to this will never see their reward at the box office, it will see new life on video and perhaps more importantly, it will thrill and invigorate a generation of movie fans.Your money baby!Swingers certainly is!10 out of 10- This is not just a hidden gem, it is an excellent film and props have to be sent out to Favreau for writing this and Liman for directing it.  I really wish that Favreau would write more films.  He has a gift.  Swingers is a perfect example of that gift.One last observation Check out the Sega hockey scene.  It is absolutely hilarious.
