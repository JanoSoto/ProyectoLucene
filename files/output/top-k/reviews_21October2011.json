I cannot remember anyone who had seen this that didn't enjoy it but somehow, it had escaped my attention until now. So forgive me if I'm a little late to the party but at least I now understand where you are all coming from. Yes, it's a Disney sport-based movie and yes, it hasn't dated that well in terms of effects (or fashions!). But there is a real charm, chemistry between the leads and genuine humour to it that lifts this above most other movies of this type. It's not quite Rocky but given a Jamaican twist and you're halfway there.Aspiring sprinter Derice (Leon) dreams of competing in the Olympics but at the trials, he is unfortunately tripped up by fellow competitor Junior (Rawle D. Lewis) and blows his chance. Initially distraught, he soon discovers that a legendary bobsleigh coach (John Candy) lives on Jamaica and decides to start competing in the Winter Olympics as part of Jamaica's first bobsled team. Recruiting his best friend Sanka (Doug E. Doug) and fellow sprinter Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba), the five of them jet off to Calgary to compete despite the fact that they have no sled, no real exposure to the cold and the lack of acceptance from the other competitors. But bobsledding is about more than technique - it's about belief, friendship and not taking things too seriously.Anybody expecting a serious sports drama had better look elsewhere because Cool Runnings never takes itself seriously. In fact, the greatest compliment I can pay it is that for the most part, it never actually feels like a sports movie - mainly due to the comedy which is both funny and well-performed. With Candy being the only actor I recognise, the four leads acquit themselves very well alongside their heavyweight co-star, who seems to be lacking some of the spark that made him so watchable in the likes of Planes, Trains and Automobiles. The story, based on fact, doesn't offer any real surprises as the usual obstacles and hiccups along the way emerge. What this film does have, aside from commendable humour, is a heart to it and a sense that (for once) winning isn't everything.It does look its age in places - the bobsledding scenes are understandably rough around the edges and the day-glo fashions are extremely reminiscent of the early Nineties - but Cool Runnings remains a very watchable effort. It doesn't have any pretences of greatness about it, unlike most other sports films where the big game at the end is literally the biggest thing in the world. Here, they just want to compete and this sits well with the easy-going Jamaican vibe to the film which is undeniably infectious. Despite the snow and ice, the film has a warm, sunny glow to it and while I detest describing anything as heartwarming, Cool Runnings would certainly qualify. Champion!

The plot is about a New York City detective trying to catch a serial killer who finds victims through the singles column in a newspaper.This film is directed by Harold Becker,who made a great film that is in the tradition of Jagged Edge and Fatal Attraction during its decade of release in the 80's.Others have considered it a great prequel to Basic Instinct,a movie of the same category back in the 90's.New York Police detective Frank Keller (Pacino) is an alcoholic. His wife ran away from him and remarried one of his colleague detectives. Frank is angry and aggressive. He investigates a murder of a man in Manhattan, shot dead while face down naked in his bed while listening to a 45rpm recording of Sea of Love. Keller has three clues - a lipstick- smeared cigarette, a want ad the dead man placed in a newspaper and a perfect set of fingerprints.A second man dies in the same manner in Queens. Detective Sherman Touhey (Goodman) from that department suggests that Frank and Sherman collaborate. Both victims put rhyming ads in the paper looking for dates. They track down Raymond Brown, the only other man with a rhyming ad. He's a married man and admits placing the ad, but swears on his children's lives that he threw away all the letters and never saw anyone.Frank has an idea - place their own rhyming ad in the paper, take any women who respond to a restaurant and take the prints from their drinking glasses. His boss thinks it is a bad idea and does not approve the idea. He changes his mind when Raymond Brown also turns up dead in the same manner as the other two murder victims.Frank has dinner with several women, while Sherman &#x97; posing as a waiter &#x97; puts their glasses into evidence bags. One of the women, Helen Cruger (Barkin) snubs Keller and leaves before she takes a drink. Keller bumps into her again at a market, but this time, Cruger is more friendly. Frank takes Helen to his place, against his better judgement and advice from Sherman not to do so. They start getting passionate when Frank panics finding a gun in her purse, but it turns out to be just a starting pistol. Frank and Helen begin a relationship. Keller has a chance to obtain Cruger's fingerprints on a glass, but decides to wipe the glass clean. Their relationship becomes rocky when Cruger discovers that Keller is a cop.Cruger's ex-husband Terry (Michael Rooker) breaks into Keller's apartment and threatening him with a gun, makes Frank lie on his bed and show him how he made love to Helen, just as he had done with his ex- wife's other three boyfriends. Frank overpowers Terry and tries to call the police, but the killer lunges at him and, in the struggle, Terry is accidentally thrown through the window and plunges to his death. Frank and Helen reunite. She forgives him, and they resume their relationship.Despite of its manipulative plot,I do believe that the movie makes it up for its strong performances.Particular to that is Al Pacino.He tries to live up to the roles that he played in the 70's like Serpico,Dog Day Afternoon and early 80's like Scarface,which he truly is known for.Aside from Pacino,Ellen Barkin also makes good use of her sex appeal to make the movie work especially in the aspect of the love story between Frank and Helen.While John Goodman provides comic relief very well in some good parts of the film.Aside from that,the movie makes good use of suspense to make the story interesting and engaging despite the fact that the plot devices used have been seen many time before in other film especially in the end.Overall,Sea Of Love is more than just a popcorn crime thriller but it falls short of being critically acclaimed film because of the forced twist at the end of the film.

Crazy? No, brilliant. Jimmy Rabbitte is the young man with the dream. He's unemployed (who isn't?) but that's OK because he has the idea, the passion that will change everything. Drawing from the down-and-out youth of Dublin he's going to put together the world's greatest band. And he has just one type of music in mind soul. Does this make any sense? Not to anybody else. But Jimmy's got the vision. And somehow it all begins to come together. His band, The Commitments, is on its way. But it's not a straight ride to the top. There will be struggles and conflicts and life lessons along the way. But the journey is worth it because, despite all the odds stacked against them, it turns out The Commitments are one heck of a band. Playing their wonderful, unique, rockin' Dublin soul.It's a great ensemble cast that makes up this movie's band. Robert Arkins plays Jimmy, the guy who brings it all together. And then the musicians do their thing. Never for a moment do you not buy into these performers as a real band. Their acting is fine but it's the music they play that makes the movie shine. Unlike so many other movies of this type almost all the singing and playing is actually done by the actors themselves. And when The Commitments cut loose this movie rocks. Jimmy Rabbitte might take exception to that. It's not rock, it's soul. Whatever it is it's absolutely bursting with energy. And that is thanks largely to one exceptionally talented young man. While everyone in the band plays their role well there's no way around it, Andrew Strong is the star. Unbelievably just 16 years old when the film was made, Strong plays lead singer Deco Cuffe. And he's got the voice of a singing god with the charisma and star power to match. But there's a problem. Deco is a completely insufferable jerk. Everyone else in the band hates him, and rightly so. Deco may well tear this group apart.The movie follows the band's rise, with all the drama Deco causes threatening a fall before they hit the big time. Which would be a shame because this band is awesome. When first thrown together they understandably make a stuttering start. But once they get their act together they are something to behold. The music they play is fantastic and it makes the movie so much fun. Whether performing a tender ballad or a really rocking number The Commitments hit all the right notes as they run through a soul classics songbook. Try A Little Tenderness and In The Midnight Hour are two obvious highlights but every song really works, not a musical misstep to be found. The music is so great it largely overshadows the rest of the film. The story largely takes a back seat but there are plenty of good moments in between the big musical numbers too. For as good as he is on stage Strong is also excellent portraying the boorish lout Deco offstage as well. Arkins is terrific as band manager Jimmy, holding his band of misfits together. One other standout is Johnny Murphy as Joey 'The Lips' Fagan. He's the wise old hand of the group, a trumpet-playing philosopher who's played with all the greats. Here is a man who appreciates the journey. He also appreciates the opportunity to bed the band's three lovely female backup singers. The band in this movie goes on a magical ride. And lucky us, we get to go along. This movie is a rollicking good time. Dublin soul rocks.

Crazy? No, brilliant. Jimmy Rabbitte is the young man with the dream. He's unemployed (who isn't?) but that's OK because he has the idea, the passion that will change everything. Drawing from the down-and-out youth of Dublin he's going to put together the world's greatest band. And he has just one type of music in mind soul. Does this make any sense? Not to anybody else. But Jimmy's got the vision. And somehow it all begins to come together. His band, The Commitments, is on its way. But it's not a straight ride to the top. There will be struggles and conflicts and life lessons along the way. But the journey is worth it because, despite all the odds stacked against them, it turns out The Commitments are one heck of a band. Playing their wonderful, unique, rockin' Dublin soul.It's a great ensemble cast that makes up this movie's band. Robert Arkins plays Jimmy, the guy who brings it all together. And then the musicians do their thing. Never for a moment do you not buy into these performers as a real band. Their acting is fine but it's the music they play that makes the movie shine. Unlike so many other movies of this type almost all the singing and playing is actually done by the actors themselves. And when The Commitments cut loose this movie rocks. Jimmy Rabbitte might take exception to that. It's not rock, it's soul. Whatever it is it's absolutely bursting with energy. And that is thanks largely to one exceptionally talented young man. While everyone in the band plays their role well there's no way around it, Andrew Strong is the star. Unbelievably just 16 years old when the film was made, Strong plays lead singer Deco Cuffe. And he's got the voice of a singing god with the charisma and star power to match. But there's a problem. Deco is a completely insufferable jerk. Everyone else in the band hates him, and rightly so. Deco may well tear this group apart.The movie follows the band's rise, with all the drama Deco causes threatening a fall before they hit the big time. Which would be a shame because this band is awesome. When first thrown together they understandably make a stuttering start. But once they get their act together they are something to behold. The music they play is fantastic and it makes the movie so much fun. Whether performing a tender ballad or a really rocking number The Commitments hit all the right notes as they run through a soul classics songbook. Try A Little Tenderness and In The Midnight Hour are two obvious highlights but every song really works, not a musical misstep to be found. The music is so great it largely overshadows the rest of the film. The story largely takes a back seat but there are plenty of good moments in between the big musical numbers too. For as good as he is on stage Strong is also excellent portraying the boorish lout Deco offstage as well. Arkins is terrific as band manager Jimmy, holding his band of misfits together. One other standout is Johnny Murphy as Joey 'The Lips' Fagan. He's the wise old hand of the group, a trumpet-playing philosopher who's played with all the greats. Here is a man who appreciates the journey. He also appreciates the opportunity to bed the band's three lovely female backup singers. The band in this movie goes on a magical ride. And lucky us, we get to go along. This movie is a rollicking good time. Dublin soul rocks.

Aliens were generally friendly, as in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or if they weren't at least they were only trying to shoot you with a ray-gun, not bite your face off in some dank corridor. With Alien, the sci-fi genre reacquired that sense of horror and paranoia which it had had in its 1950s heyday.The look of the thing is all-important here. The design team have created an environment that looks suitably space age-y but also very gritty and industrial, with an emphasis on tight enclosure. The room of the mother computer is easily the brightest, yet its low, curved ceiling makes it incredibly claustrophobic. Director Ridley Scott often keeps his camera amid the clutter.

Throughout the movie Scott integrates simple elements of light and sound &#x96; squeals, clanks, flashes &#x96; and his sense of timing really makes this a triumph of horror. One of the great things about the production design and the way Scott shoots it is that the creature often blends into the paraphernalia, creating several surprise moments where we realise it was in plain view all along.Another brilliant thing about Alien is that the crew of the Nostromo don't look like a set heroic, uniformed space pioneers.

After almost 50(!) years it hasn't lost any its power and might still very well make a big impact on you, when you go and see it for the fist time.The movie is still original to watch now days, so imaging how things must have been like for viewers back in 1968. It was something unseen, the way the movie approached its genre. Science-fiction at the time hadn't been a very profitable genre but more importantly, it was a genre that wasn't taken very seriously by critics and lots of film-makers. Yet this movie managed to get made, with lots of talents and acclaimed persons involved, in front and behind the cameras.This movie is all the more an accomplishment when you look at it from the perspective and context of its time period. Even though the movie is science-fiction and is definitely filled with lots of fiction, it still is one that puts its emphasis on its science. The movie takes a very reasonable approach to its story, events and characters. Everything gets looked at from different perspectives and asks itself a lot of questions, dealing with topics such as religion and what is it that makes a civilization an advanced and civilized one.But even when you don't read too deep into the movie and its themes, you'll still get plenty of enjoyment out of this movie. Even though it's most definitely not an action filled one, it's still fast paced and makes sure that there is always something happening or progressing within its story. I remember watching this movie ever since I was a young kid, when I probably couldn't even read subtitles yet but I never was bored with it, also not even now that I have seen the movie countless times already and know it by heart.It's a movie that is a quite serious one within its genre when you purely look at its story but luckily they managed to make the movie at the same time a very entertain and enjoyable one to watch. It's because the movie is filled with plenty of great and unforgettable moments and overall is an extremely well made one in every regard.One of the things obviously is its make-up. All of the apes are so fantastical but above all also realistic looking. They have a great look to them and it would had been very easy to mess up. Imaging how much this movie would had been laughed at and not taken seriously if it wasn't for the convincing and Oscar winning make-up effects, by John Chambers.Another thing that always stood out to me was the Jerry Goldsmith musical score. It's unlike anything else really and quite daring for its time as well. It suits the atmosphere and madness of the movie so well and over the years has grown out to be one of his most iconic and appreciated scores.What the movie always did so well to me was creating a sort of atmosphere of madness and absurdity. The main character finds himself in a pretty absurd situation from pretty much the start on already and things soon start to get worse and worse and more unusual for him. Just like the main character, you really want to scream out, when he gets treated incredibly unrighteously and hold prison by the apes. All of these elements get strengthened due to the entire way the movie got shot and told by Franklin J. Schaffner, along with its sets, experimental style of film-making, make-up, music and acting performance by Charlton Heston.Yes, of course I can see how incredibly over-the-top Charlton Heston is going with his performance at times but I actually think this adds to the movie its madness and unusual style and story. I wouldn't want to have it any other way really. Also amazing to see lots of other great actors from the earlier days of cinema behind the ape make-up. Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall were pretty big acting names once and this so easily could had been a movie that would had done more harm than good for their careers but needless to say that it all turned out alright. Not that they had big shining careers after this movie but it at least added some wonderful and memorable roles to their resume and legacy as actors.And talking about memorable; it's definitely true that this movie has one of the absolute best surprise endings and shots out of movie history. I'm not going to spoil it for you, some DVD covers are doing that already. But man, I would love to see some of the surprises off people's faces who see it for the first time. It's however hard to imaging though that there are actually still people out there who haven't seen this movie yet.A classic, not just only within its genre and an absolute must-see for everybody.9\/10 http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"21 October 2011","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Planet of the Apes remains a great and special movie within its genre, that also still remains a perfectly watchable and effective one now days.

Yet this movie managed to get made, with lots of talents and acclaimed persons involved, in front and behind the cameras.This movie is all the more an accomplishment when you look at it from the perspective and context of its time period. Even though the movie is science-fiction and is definitely filled with lots of fiction, it still is one that puts its emphasis on its science. The movie takes a very reasonable approach to its story, events and characters. Everything gets looked at from different perspectives and asks itself a lot of questions, dealing with topics such as religion and what is it that makes a civilization an advanced and civilized one.But even when you don't read too deep into the movie and its themes, you'll still get plenty of enjoyment out of this movie. Even though it's most definitely not an action filled one, it's still fast paced and makes sure that there is always something happening or progressing within its story. I remember watching this movie ever since I was a young kid, when I probably couldn't even read subtitles yet but I never was bored with it, also not even now that I have seen the movie countless times already and know it by heart.It's a movie that is a quite serious one within its genre when you purely look at its story but luckily they managed to make the movie at the same time a very entertain and enjoyable one to watch. It's because the movie is filled with plenty of great and unforgettable moments and overall is an extremely well made one in every regard.One of the things obviously is its make-up. All of the apes are so fantastical but above all also realistic looking. They have a great look to them and it would had been very easy to mess up. Imaging how much this movie would had been laughed at and not taken seriously if it wasn't for the convincing and Oscar winning make-up effects, by John Chambers.Another thing that always stood out to me was the Jerry Goldsmith musical score. It's unlike anything else really and quite daring for its time as well. It suits the atmosphere and madness of the movie so well and over the years has grown out to be one of his most iconic and appreciated scores.What the movie always did so well to me was creating a sort of atmosphere of madness and absurdity. The main character finds himself in a pretty absurd situation from pretty much the start on already and things soon start to get worse and worse and more unusual for him. Just like the main character, you really want to scream out, when he gets treated incredibly unrighteously and hold prison by the apes. All of these elements get strengthened due to the entire way the movie got shot and told by Franklin J. Schaffner, along with its sets, experimental style of film-making, make-up, music and acting performance by Charlton Heston.Yes, of course I can see how incredibly over-the-top Charlton Heston is going with his performance at times but I actually think this adds to the movie its madness and unusual style and story. I wouldn't want to have it any other way really. Also amazing to see lots of other great actors from the earlier days of cinema behind the ape make-up. Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall were pretty big acting names once and this so easily could had been a movie that would had done more harm than good for their careers but needless to say that it all turned out alright. Not that they had big shining careers after this movie but it at least added some wonderful and memorable roles to their resume and legacy as actors.And talking about memorable; it's definitely true that this movie has one of the absolute best surprise endings and shots out of movie history. I'm not going to spoil it for you, some DVD covers are doing that already. But man, I would love to see some of the surprises off people's faces who see it for the first time. It's however hard to imaging though that there are actually still people out there who haven't seen this movie yet.A classic, not just only within its genre and an absolute must-see for everybody.9\/10 http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"21 October 2011","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Planet of the Apes remains a great and special movie within its genre, that also still remains a perfectly watchable and effective one now days.

It was only natural that I liked it so well since I was a fan of 1982's classic Creepshow and I loved as a kid the Tales from the Darkside TV series along with HBO's Tales from the Crypt so this film was right for my taste as it was one of 1990's most memorable films. Done like a modern day fable with a cute and neat wraparound story that takes a twist the film was very well done with suspense and gore and it's tales and segments featured the work of many veteran acts like Deborah Harry, James Remar, William Hickey, and Rae Dawn Chong. While it showcased the early work of future talents like Christian Slater, Julianne Moore, and Steve Buscemi.Starting out in the northeast I believe in the outskirts of New York the wraparound begins with a woman named Betty(Deborah Harry)who appears good on the outside only inside her and her home lies evil she's a real modern day witch. She's holding captive little boy Timmy(Matthew Lawrence)who she plans to eat for a dinner roast! Timmy delays it though by telling his favorite stories from a book, and this gets us into the film.First up is Lot 249 based on an old Sir Arthur Conan Doyle tale, it involves a university set somewhere in a New England state in which an odd and strange but bright student Bellingham(Steve Buscemi in an early role) obtains a most unusual and old friend in the form of an ancient mummy. This is what he lives for after he was cheated out of a university prize and all of this mess was brought on by a female student body the cold and snobbish stuck up yet sexy Susan(Julianne Moore with some early work)she framed Bellingham for a wrong doing. Never fear revenge is in the works in the form of reading script and rising up an ancient mummy! As it's nice to see poor boy Bellingham have the last laugh as Susan her boyfriend Lee and brother Andy(Christian Slater) learn the meaning of final exams! Good revenge tale.Second and most disturbing it's gross with blood and gore yet a little far fetched but I guess not if you believe a cat has nine lives! Cat From Hell a short story from the great Stephen King is a tale of a black cat that simply will not die! It features a northern billionaire a pharmacy executive Drogan(the wonderful and legendary William Hickey)as a lonely and on his last leg old man who's final days are numbered after the years of torment and harassment he's seen from this black cat. And despite the hired help of a hit man Halston(David Johansen the veteran character actor)this cat will not go down no amount of money in the world can take out this cat. Unbelievable cats have more than nine lives.Last and maybe the best tale at least in terms of the moral lesson it teaches is Lover's Vow. Written by the late Michael McDowell it involves the life of a struggling New York city artist and sculptor Preston(James Remar)who simply cannot make ends meet his agent gives his work the brush. Until one night late outside a bar on the city streets something horrible and strange happens it's very unspeakable something that will change his life, yet Preston makes a promise and he lives. Then he meets on the streets a strange and exotic erotic beauty named Carola(Rae Dawn Chong)this is the girl of his dreams. For ten years peace and happiness is brought only the past haunts him. Sadly and very hurtful to watch in the end is to see Preston break his promise. In the end his vows, life, love and family is all taken away so sad. It proves that secrets are better off and to be kept hidden don't tell it and don't break a promise.Then the wraparound ends with a surprise happy twist an ending of a surprise roast the modern day witch has to eat her own medicine. Overall director John Harrison directed a great film one that's a highly memorable classic a horror anthology that I will never forget it's bag of mixed tales were a tasty treat for my taste!

While it showcased the early work of future talents like Christian Slater, Julianne Moore, and Steve Buscemi.Starting out in the northeast I believe in the outskirts of New York the wraparound begins with a woman named Betty(Deborah Harry)who appears good on the outside only inside her and her home lies evil she's a real modern day witch. She's holding captive little boy Timmy(Matthew Lawrence)who she plans to eat for a dinner roast! Timmy delays it though by telling his favorite stories from a book, and this gets us into the film.First up is Lot 249 based on an old Sir Arthur Conan Doyle tale, it involves a university set somewhere in a New England state in which an odd and strange but bright student Bellingham(Steve Buscemi in an early role) obtains a most unusual and old friend in the form of an ancient mummy. This is what he lives for after he was cheated out of a university prize and all of this mess was brought on by a female student body the cold and snobbish stuck up yet sexy Susan(Julianne Moore with some early work)she framed Bellingham for a wrong doing. Never fear revenge is in the works in the form of reading script and rising up an ancient mummy! As it's nice to see poor boy Bellingham have the last laugh as Susan her boyfriend Lee and brother Andy(Christian Slater) learn the meaning of final exams! Good revenge tale.Second and most disturbing it's gross with blood and gore yet a little far fetched but I guess not if you believe a cat has nine lives! Cat From Hell a short story from the great Stephen King is a tale of a black cat that simply will not die! It features a northern billionaire a pharmacy executive Drogan(the wonderful and legendary William Hickey)as a lonely and on his last leg old man who's final days are numbered after the years of torment and harassment he's seen from this black cat. And despite the hired help of a hit man Halston(David Johansen the veteran character actor)this cat will not go down no amount of money in the world can take out this cat. Unbelievable cats have more than nine lives.Last and maybe the best tale at least in terms of the moral lesson it teaches is Lover's Vow. Written by the late Michael McDowell it involves the life of a struggling New York city artist and sculptor Preston(James Remar)who simply cannot make ends meet his agent gives his work the brush. Until one night late outside a bar on the city streets something horrible and strange happens it's very unspeakable something that will change his life, yet Preston makes a promise and he lives. Then he meets on the streets a strange and exotic erotic beauty named Carola(Rae Dawn Chong)this is the girl of his dreams. For ten years peace and happiness is brought only the past haunts him. Sadly and very hurtful to watch in the end is to see Preston break his promise. In the end his vows, life, love and family is all taken away so sad. It proves that secrets are better off and to be kept hidden don't tell it and don't break a promise.Then the wraparound ends with a surprise happy twist an ending of a surprise roast the modern day witch has to eat her own medicine.

Dan Aykroyd provides the most interesting story arc, as the man who learns about the true value of life only when deprived from every single valuable thing. From riches to wags, Winthorpe will understand that sometimes, the best way to get to the top is to get back to the bottom, and sometimes the most valuable things are not made of gold, well, except for the heart of the hooker Ophelia, Jamie Lee Curtis in one of his most endearing roles.

The movie begins with a shot of space and small craft jettisoning a pod to earth. Flash to a small base somewhere in Central America, a helicopter arrives with a group of soldiers for a mission. Their leader Dutch (Arnold) is briefed on the mission by Dillon CIA (Weathers) and General Phillips (Armstrong), that a cabinet minister went down in hostile territory. Just for fact it's the fictional country of Val Verde, not Guatemala. Dutch smells trouble but has to go along and then we meet the characters on the helicopter ride. Blain (Ventura) packing a mini gun, Poncho (Chavez) special grenade launcher, Billy (Landham), Mac (Duke), Hawkins (Black), all with distinct personalities and weapons. Billy picks up the trail, Dutch is suspicious and more so when they come across Green Berets he knows, who have been killed, skinned and strung up. They take out the commie guerrilla base, and take a female guerrilla Anna (Carrillo) captive. Dutch finds out Dillon double crossed them to do the mission, time to go home right? Wrong. Soon one by one his men are picked off with seemingly no enemy to fight back at and weapons never seen before. Eventually they make a stand against what seems to be something not of this world. After his men are killed, Dutch virtually unarmed makes run for the jungle telling Anna to run and Get to the choppa! Dutch by accident learns the creature can't see him while covered in mud. Using this to his advantage he fortifies grounds for a final showdown. After a lengthy fight Dutch is forced into a hand to hand fight, which becomes a route. Beaten to a pulp he crawls to his main trap. The Predator smells it and thinks he out smarted him only to have Dutch kick the trap and smash the Predator with a massive log, immobilizing him. Dutch gets up and is going to lay a rock to his skull, but just asks What the hell are you? The Predator repeats it, then reaches for his wrist sets a bomb and starts laughing. Dutch gets the, message and runs for his life before a small nuclear explosion takes out the area. Standing tall at the end, ravaged by battle he is picked up by Phillips and Anna and taken off into the sunset.This is my favorite Arnold film and basically the perfect male flick. There's virtually nothing in this film a female could like. The only one in the film is there for some info and nothing more. No nudity, senseless character development, or any garbage to slow it down. You get a little here and there on some and that's it, we don't need to here about the characters stupid kids on weekends, short and sweet, no nonsense. Recent films bog down in character development.Where the movie really shines, is probably the cast. Its one of those films that's just perfect. It happens rarely but there are some. Arnold, need I say more? He is the ultimate leader from the start arm wrestling with another great Carl Weathers. No skinny boys from new films, these are guys you actually believe could kick ass. Other greats, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham, Richard Chaves and even Shane Black, the smallest guy manages to be good, just on his stupid jokes. Even if you hated the film, you remember the guy telling the gross jokes. Arnold is needed to take on 7 ft tall Kevin Peter Hall (RIP) who, in costume made Arnold look mortal. It just doesn't work having a guy who can't match up to a big guy, see Predators, an obvious miscast.The characters are another strong point. Almost all have a unique weapon and personality. This helps you to remember them. The obvious one is Blain carrying around the mini gun, pointless yes, but in a comic book type film it works. He chews tobacco, curses and just wants to slaughter the enemy. Some of those classic lines I ain't got time to bleed are his people. Dutch all business and bicep's, Dillon devious, Billy spiritual, Poncho underrated toughest to the end, Mac loyal friend looking for revenge and Hawkins the comedic guy. But the other star is the Predator itself. Thanks to the great Stan Winston (RIP) who created this creature that has become an icon of sci fi fans everywhere. With KPH's performance it just jelled perfectly and became a classic. This movie does contain lots of memorable one liners from many of the characters that also makes it great. You can't put these in other films and expect them to work, this is why this is a classic. You get bits a pieces of what the creature is that is flushed out more in Predator 2.As far and direction and special effects, it all works. John McTiernan takes the cast and delivers a solid action flick as he would with another classic Die Hard. Stan Winston's creation probably delivers the film in then end. The original design was bad, so call in Stan to save the day. The obvious active camouflage has become a staple of the predator series along with the heat vision that the predator sees in. All work out while keeping the enemy basically hidden till the end. The Special DVD has plenty of stuff behind the scenes, effects, interviews and commentary that should not be missed by any fan. I've been watching this since being a kid in the 80's, overall a big 10 out of 10 for one of Arnold's greatest films and top 80's action flick.

It just doesn't work having a guy who can't match up to a big guy, see Predators, an obvious miscast.The characters are another strong point. Almost all have a unique weapon and personality. This helps you to remember them. The obvious one is Blain carrying around the mini gun, pointless yes, but in a comic book type film it works. He chews tobacco, curses and just wants to slaughter the enemy. Some of those classic lines I ain't got time to bleed are his people. Dutch all business and bicep's, Dillon devious, Billy spiritual, Poncho underrated toughest to the end, Mac loyal friend looking for revenge and Hawkins the comedic guy. But the other star is the Predator itself. Thanks to the great Stan Winston (RIP) who created this creature that has become an icon of sci fi fans everywhere. With KPH's performance it just jelled perfectly and became a classic. This movie does contain lots of memorable one liners from many of the characters that also makes it great. You can't put these in other films and expect them to work, this is why this is a classic. You get bits a pieces of what the creature is that is flushed out more in Predator 2.As far and direction and special effects, it all works. John McTiernan takes the cast and delivers a solid action flick as he would with another classic Die Hard. Stan Winston's creation probably delivers the film in then end. The original design was bad, so call in Stan to save the day. The obvious active camouflage has become a staple of the predator series along with the heat vision that the predator sees in. All work out while keeping the enemy basically hidden till the end. The Special DVD has plenty of stuff behind the scenes, effects, interviews and commentary that should not be missed by any fan. I've been watching this since being a kid in the 80's, overall a big 10 out of 10 for one of Arnold's greatest films and top 80's action flick. Followed by a worthy sequel Predator 2, anyone who remakes this should be hunted.

A lot of the characters are certainly the same and are almost interchangeable.My favourite part of the film is probably the first hour. I really enjoy the coming to terms scenes of the two Conoels. It is well acted and portrayed in a believable and enjoyable way. The interplay between the two characters is well done. Alec Guiness portrays the stuffy Conoel Nicholson perfectly, he is once again superb. I especially enjoy the scene where he and the other officers stare down a machine gun, reflecting the courage and tenacity which was common place in the military of that time.The two story threads, one attempting to complete the bridge, one to destroy it, are an obvious contrast to each other, yet they work well and it gives the viewer a sense of knowing dread for both sides as the climax approaches. The bridge building part of the story is the superior to the two, I simply prefer the characters and enjoy watching Alec Guinness slowly descend into obsession with completing the bridge.The character I really dislike is the American. He embodies all the irritating and stereotypical characteristics which are so common amongst cinematic versions of American characters. It is perhaps a redeeming feature of his character that he is killed rather than saving the day, which is what many would expect such a self righteous character to do.The ending is fun.

This version of The Trial by Franz Kafka was by far one of the most positive, human and smile-inducing versions I have been blessed enough to see in all of this horribly depressing year . And it isn't a parody. Kelly's Heroes is still my favorite, as it is more the journey shared after all came together to bring their separate trials to an ending that gave them all the dignity they deserved. Most people are not what I consider really thinking 'OH...Trial or Apocalyse' when they watch movies. It's a thing I do...but it's better than being scarred for life so I don't feel too abnormally plugged in to those themes out of my own misery, exactly. The film's particular take is what I find most interesting as it's always completely new! No wonder the connection usually isn't seen by normal people. I have my reasons.I really enjoyed the metamorphosis in Meg Ryan's spoiled and somewhat selfish character. The whole ordeal made her grow up and showed how much their marriage was taken for granted until they finally got some real problems to flip out over. Her gradual change from ignorant and naive bitch to grateful and emotionally invested friend to the man who, lets face it...is basically an angel in human form. The kiss, in my opinion, was less about any romance that a married woman and a man who wouldn't do such an ethically dubious thing as to TRY TO TAKE A MAN'S WOMAN WHILE SAVING HIS LIFE. His professionalism never wavered. Can a huge break in that obvious level of honesty and selflessness be seen as romantic in nature? Give me a break, people! He was going to kiss a pretty woman before he died, as the mission was certainly one that would have brought that at any time. Besides, he really did develop a love for her that was less about attraction than a shared experience full of sacrifice, intensity and real dedication to family. The French prisoner; an Oddball, yet more annoyingly optimistic in his schtick like Roberto Bergnini in Life is Beautiful. at one point when speaking to Meg about her Husband, which was weird to me in its obvious bull, seemed like a sweet attempt to give her a more saintly, detailed and less miserably hard last impression of her husband's character and great help to him. He thought for sure he might be dead, after all. This is what normally happens to prisoners in such extreme circumstances. The Foreign Legion veteran is just too genius to NOT be another angel in human form. He had that mentally gone act down so easily that I had to wonder if he wrote the book on military tactics. Brilliant person of an obviously impressive amount of experience, and here is the guy he can not only educate and befriend but make an escape a possibility. Two heads were obviously necessary to get anywhere near hope in this miserable Blood Diamond-like hell. When a whole country is drained of fear or slave labor to a Dictator\/Gangster that works close enough to American Oil and other government agency interests to be equally f*cked by them completely, how is an end to it ever plausible without extra special people? This is saying just how much really is expected of all people involved here. I can't stand vain people who do nothing at all that would be considered an actual act of bravery or sacrifice, but openly and easily throw such words around (or their sycophants, friends or otherwise cover-up people) in any reference to themselves as if the act of saying it made it so. These types could be easily inserted into the QUAD\/OCTONAL geometrically doubling in it's bigness pipeline for oil-interested Devils. These incredibly phoney rich folks suck more than the quality of their dinner conversation. Liars and heartless dictators bathe in more money than they know what to do with, while those that can do better wind up like our couple here.The final rescue mission is the most reminiscent of Kelly's Heroes for me, as the very level of Special Ops skills and divinely inspired badassery was this character's same skill set, minus the humor. Nevertheless, this movie doesn't wear me down with more violent and demoralizing torture or violence, leaves the focus of its ending on the actual emotional investment made by our hero in his total,unspoken promise to protect and help this family, but carried to the completion with such unwavering commitment that Meg's awe at the miracle they were given is difficult for her to verbalize.

Quaid believes these dreams mean something and thinks he has once been to planet, something his wife (Stone) desires not to be true. Quaid's obsession with Mars continues and he signs up for memory implants at Rekall inc, a place where they implant a memory of a holiday as opposed to you having to actually go on one. As a special option to his package, Quaid chooses to have an implant of his profession being as a secret agent and getting the girl of his dreams. Midway through the procedure Quaid starts to lose control and awakens, remembering things that he didn't before. The doctors knock him unconscious and drop him in a cab, denying that he ever came in. When Quaid gets home it becomes apparent that his memory has already been erased once and his life is all just a set up. On the run from an armed secret group, Quaid must go to a communist run Mars and prove to himself who he actually is.Unlike many other Arnie movies, this one does provide some back bone. The story is good and takes you away from the world we live in and into one that everyone will be intrigued by. Who wouldn't want to go to Mars? The science fiction aspect shows a colonised Mars, housing hundreds of mutants dictated by a communist leader, who is under threat by a rebel group attempting to force the government out. Mars is played out like it is a country rather than a planet and a popular holiday destination at that. It serves up brothels, pyramids, tube lines and also what looks like an underground Times Square. Looks like a holiday destination everyone would love. Until the rebel organisation comes along of course. It seems to be a Western country mixed with a South African country. Verhoeven manages to create an atmosphere on Mars and makes you believe in the planet as opposed to having to convince yourself that it is actually real. His set up fills in all the blanks you need and for all you know it could just be a different country.I have reviewed Arnie's films before and let's be honest I don't let the guy live down his poor performances but in this movie he actually had me convinced. Let's get it straight, he can't act, when it comes to emotion he just fails, but in this film he shows confusion and vulnerability and strangely he delivers. Of course there is the odd cheese ball line, spoken with more v's and z's then it should be but the odd one I am willing to let go. Other than The Terminator this is Arnie's best performance.For its age the effects are brilliant. Special effects are used throughout and they really do capture imagination. Sure some of them look a little overdone and it is obvious they are fake but that is one thing that makes the film fun. One for instance is when Arnie pulls a golf ball sized tracking device out of his head through his nose. Sure it looks rubber but it looks good.Most scenes are also filled with gung ho action and firing guns. To some people this is too much but it is all so fitting here. Also the effects of a man being shot look so realistic that it has you clenching believing it is real. Only one other film has made me feel awkward during a shooting and that was another Verhoeven film, Robocop, where the villains kill the cop who ultimately becomes the hero. Just the thought of it sends a shiver down my spine.The film gives off a fun feel and has several aspects that many will like. The talking Johnny Cab is one that everyone will love and the mutant child who can tell you your fortune. Lots of areas really help you connect with the film and although many serious themes are involved most of the action is taken with a pinch of salt. It is just fun.Overall an enjoyable film and one I always remember for people's eyes popping out their heads.

I hadn't seen this movie for years and although not one of the best I have ever seen it is one that always entertains me and one I always look forward to watching.

Quaid believes these dreams mean something and thinks he has once been to planet, something his wife (Stone) desires not to be true. Quaid's obsession with Mars continues and he signs up for memory implants at Rekall inc, a place where they implant a memory of a holiday as opposed to you having to actually go on one. As a special option to his package, Quaid chooses to have an implant of his profession being as a secret agent and getting the girl of his dreams. Midway through the procedure Quaid starts to lose control and awakens, remembering things that he didn't before. The doctors knock him unconscious and drop him in a cab, denying that he ever came in. When Quaid gets home it becomes apparent that his memory has already been erased once and his life is all just a set up. On the run from an armed secret group, Quaid must go to a communist run Mars and prove to himself who he actually is.Unlike many other Arnie movies, this one does provide some back bone. The story is good and takes you away from the world we live in and into one that everyone will be intrigued by. Who wouldn't want to go to Mars? The science fiction aspect shows a colonised Mars, housing hundreds of mutants dictated by a communist leader, who is under threat by a rebel group attempting to force the government out. Mars is played out like it is a country rather than a planet and a popular holiday destination at that. It serves up brothels, pyramids, tube lines and also what looks like an underground Times Square. Looks like a holiday destination everyone would love. Until the rebel organisation comes along of course. It seems to be a Western country mixed with a South African country. Verhoeven manages to create an atmosphere on Mars and makes you believe in the planet as opposed to having to convince yourself that it is actually real. His set up fills in all the blanks you need and for all you know it could just be a different country.I have reviewed Arnie's films before and let's be honest I don't let the guy live down his poor performances but in this movie he actually had me convinced. Let's get it straight, he can't act, when it comes to emotion he just fails, but in this film he shows confusion and vulnerability and strangely he delivers. Of course there is the odd cheese ball line, spoken with more v's and z's then it should be but the odd one I am willing to let go. Other than The Terminator this is Arnie's best performance.For its age the effects are brilliant. Special effects are used throughout and they really do capture imagination. Sure some of them look a little overdone and it is obvious they are fake but that is one thing that makes the film fun. One for instance is when Arnie pulls a golf ball sized tracking device out of his head through his nose. Sure it looks rubber but it looks good.Most scenes are also filled with gung ho action and firing guns. To some people this is too much but it is all so fitting here. Also the effects of a man being shot look so realistic that it has you clenching believing it is real. Only one other film has made me feel awkward during a shooting and that was another Verhoeven film, Robocop, where the villains kill the cop who ultimately becomes the hero. Just the thought of it sends a shiver down my spine.The film gives off a fun feel and has several aspects that many will like. The talking Johnny Cab is one that everyone will love and the mutant child who can tell you your fortune. Lots of areas really help you connect with the film and although many serious themes are involved most of the action is taken with a pinch of salt. It is just fun.Overall an enjoyable film and one I always remember for people's eyes popping out their heads. I hadn't seen this movie for years and although not one of the best I have ever seen it is one that always entertains me and one I always look forward to watching.

We are in no doubt that Elwood drinks regularly, but we never see him drunk - though Jimmy Stewart's customary slurring of words would make it harder to tell! Chase would have seen the bad effects of hard drinking where she grew-up and she was clearly familiar with the Alcoholics Anonymous movement that was trying to counter them. (The repeated references to Akron, Ohio indicate this.) The story avoids any simple answers and seeks to persuade us to be kinder to one another.It would be interesting to know whether Chase thought that too vigorous a pursuit of sobriety might, in some cases, cause people to lose a sense of magic in pursuit of normality.Most people who care about a recovering alcoholic, i.e. one who doesn't drink any more will, would say the gain is well worth the risk, but it is a good thing for more extreme abstentionists to remember that regaining kindness and good humour is a large part of the point of their programme. I think this is one reason Jimmy Stewart cared such a lot about this story, especially after having played it in theatre.
