His romantic counterpart was very intolerable, and this resulted in an extremely forced romance between two characters who had no reason to fall in love. That all being said, the movie had teeth, and it was unafraid to kill off characters left and right. The main theme of non-conformity really beat you over the head throughout the film, and could have been a bit more subtle. This basic plot leads me to believe this film is directed at kids, but the innuendo and adult-jokes make me think otherwise. Not sure if it's a good kids movie since I'm not a kid anymore, but Antz is a pretty good film with some problems here and there.

Discipline is not the enemy of enthusiasm! In the 1980s, Joe Louis Clark became the new principal of Eastside High School, located in Paterson, New Jersey, which was one of New Jersey's toughest inner city schools. He managed to turn the school around, despite the people who criticized him and tried to stop him. It's no wonder that a few years later, in 1989, a film version of his story was released. The film, which stars one of the best actors alive, Morgan Freeman, managed to gross 3x it's budget and became a big success due to it's storyline and characters. How does the film hold up twenty-six years later? Lean On Me follows a former teacher at Eastside High School who comes back twenty years later as the Principal, and finds that the school is in need of dire help in order to keep the state from gaining control of the school.I first heard about this film due to my mother, who watched it several times when I was younger, and that was how I remember scenes like the ending and the song, Lean On Me. So, when I saw the film was going to be on for the last time for a while, I recorded it and sat down to watch. Man, this is a pretty good film.The acting is phenomenal, most notably from Morgan Freeman. I have no idea how Freeman didn't get nominated for Best Actor for his role as Joe Clark, because he does a fantastic job, what with all the speeches and the powerful scenes he has to carry. Beverly Todd does a great job as Mrs. Levias, and the best scene she does is one toward the end of the film, fighting against Morgan Freeman's character about what he's supposed to be doing with the kids at the school.Alan North does a fine job as the Mayor. Robert Guillaume does a phenomenal job as well as Dr. Napier, and his best scene comes about midway through the film when he and Clark argue about Clark's methods of controlling his students. Lynne Thigpen does a deliciously evil job as Mrs. Barnett, a parent who doesn't agree with Clark from the beginning and does her best to get him fired.The music in the film was great. The instrumental music, composed by Bill Conti, was fantastic and fit all the songs they were used in. The other songs, which were songs like Welcome to the Jungle and of course, the titular song, Lean On Me, all worked very well. The cinematography, and set design, especially in the shots of the rundown Eastside High all look very convincing and the school looks even better when it's redone.The script was very riveting and was great at really portraying how these kids acted and how Mr. Clark was going to deal with them. It was all very refreshing, a script that really showed the reality of these kids and didn't just demonize them or praise them to make things more dramatic or interesting. Perhaps my only issue with the film is that the whole film feels very brutal, never really slowing enough to let some of the more emotional moments sink in.Overall, Lean On Me is a fantastic film. While I did have some issues with the overall brutal feel of the film, the acting, music, cinematography, set design and script are all fantastic and work about as well as they could have in this setting. I'm honestly shocked Morgan Freeman didn't get an Oscar nod for his revolutionary performance here.

Nevertheless, I think that The Lost World Jurassic Park still succeeds as a sequel to Jurassic Park on a few things, such as bringing a substantially darker imagery to the screen, a stronger (though somewhat under-developed) plot, more dinosaurs and more breathtaking visual effects, and the result is that the dinosaurs are more believable and life-like than in the first Jurassic film. However, these aren't the only things that the second Jurassic movie managed to improve upon. The movie also offers plenty of brilliant, top scenes, such as I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CALL THIS KIND OF LONG TRUCK being half run over a high and dangerous cliff by the T- Rex, the T-Rex struggling to fit its big mouth and tongue inside a small-spaced cave from behind a waterfall, in order to eat the main characters, the T- Rex entering its big head through an opening tent and sniffing on the two main, struggling-to- be- silent characters who are in their beds, the bloody attack of many tiny dinosaurs on the mercenary guy, the T-Rex walking in the American streets and more still. The dialog is another very strong element in the film and flows in an incredibly and smoothly efficient way. Once again, Steven Spielberg delivers us a reasonable amount of screen time with two of the fiercest dinosaurs ever to have ruled the earth the T-Rex and the Velociraptors (I know, I'm doing the same phrasing as in my Jurassic Park review, sorry for that). One of the scenes that I loved in this film is Jeff Goldblum's character's single- handed fight against one Raptor. I loved that scene, because each action part of that same scene smoothly and efficiently brought on the next action part, and the effects worked well there. Jeff Goldblum's character is well written and he moves the adventure forward and so do the other main characters. I congratulate Steven Spielberg and his filmmaking team for all of the positive things I said about this film. Be proud of yourselves gentlemen, really. The movie wasn't entirely well done however. One of the movie's flaws is that a few supposed-to-be-heart-pounding scenes didn't work out on me and that left me in absolute disappointment. If only this one thing had worked, I would have largely forgiven the other faults the movie has and which I am about to talk right now. The next fault is a plot hole and it is in the scene with the T-Rex on the ship. Well, the crucial problem about this scene is that the ship carrying the big dinosaur is seen going full speed at the dock for no reason whatsoever. After this happens, people come on the ship to investigate, only to discover the entire crew dead, and now it makes you wonder What on earth could have possibly happened to the crew and why on earth was the ship going full speed at the dock?. And next, you start asking yourself something else Is it the T-Rex that did this, and if so, where is it now?. Now, the T-Rex looks like the only possible solution for the ship going full speed at the dock and for the death of the entire crew. However, the moment a guard starts opening the ship's doors, what suddenly comes out of this? The T-Rex himself! And that's when the plot hole comes, and I am sure I don't need to explain to you what it is that makes horribly no sense in that scene moment! Whatever happened to Spielberg there?! The other flaw is that the movie fails to be a truly compelling sequel, and like I said in the beginning of my review, to beat the first Jurassic movie.

Spielberg opted to not return to helm another Jurassic film, and directing duties were passed over to Joe Johnston. Jurassic Park 3 see's the return of Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant, from Jurassic Park. Laura Dern also returns as Ellie Sattler, but sadly in a less prominent role. The story for JP3 is quite simple, Grant is lured by adventurous couple Paul, & Amanda Kirby, played by William H. Macy & Tea Leoni, to fly over Isla Sorna, with Grant acting as their guide, for money. However the Kirby's are not rich, and lied to Grant so he could help them find their missing son Eric, who wen't missing weeks ago in a parasailing accident near the island. Of course things go wrong, the plane crashes leaving the Kirby's, Grant, his colleague Billy, and a few others stranded on the island. JP3 can only be enjoyed as a trilling dinosaur spectacle, but there isn't much of anything new, or interesting.There are some positives aspects in this film, Sam Neill is a fine actor, and he brings credibility to the film, and is still believable as the Grant character. While the rest of the characters aren't all that fleshed out, the film is well acted, with William H. Macy, and Sam Neill being the standouts. There's a few new dinosaurs, Spinosaurus being the main one. Spinosaurus is a neat dinosaur, and the roar for Spinosaurus is also well executed, and is distinctly different sounding from the now famous T- Rex roar. The animatronic dinosaurs\/CGI are once again well executed by Stan Winston's team, and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM). JP3 is the first film in the series to combine CGI dinosaurs along with practical ones in the same shot, and the blending between the two is well done. The Spinosaurus attack on the river is a thrilling scene, taking place in water, which hadn't been done. There is also a thrilling Pteranodon sequence, offering a ariel attack which hasn't been seen yet in the franchise. The scene is dimly lit, with fog, and creates the best sense of suspense in the movie. The music in the scene is probably my favorite bit of new music in the film. John Williams didn't score JP3, instead composer Don Davis best known for his work in The Matrix films, provides the music, and does a good job, creating new music that still fits stylistically within the franchise.Though there are positives in JP3 there are many negatives as well. One of the biggest ones I had was the screenwriters not having Grant, and Ellie as a couple. Instead they have a friendship type relationship, and Ellie has a child (with some random guy) who call's Grant the dinosaur man. It just seems stupid to not have Grant be with Ellie after the events of the first film. Grant's character arch of not wanting children changes after he saves Lex, and Tim, and is seemingly ready to settle down with Ellie, which now seems wasted. The dumbest thing about it is it adds nothing to the characters, or the overall film, and was a stupid decision on the writers part. Grant has a dream on the plane nearing the island, and turns to see a raptor that says Alan. The scene is very cheesy, and really is just plain silly, right up there with the gymnast scene in TLW. The Spinosaurus T-Rex fight is neat, but having the T-Rex (a fan favorite) lose, and die, just didn't sit right with many fans, myself included. The characters (while well acted), aren't all that interesting, or all that likable, the Kirby's put peoples lives in danger to find their son, and Billy, decides it would be a good idea to steal raptor eggs to help fund their research back home. There are also many continuity issues in the film, like why the island doesn't look the way it did in TLW, or why the raptors look radically different (some have feather-like quills on their head) from how they did in the pervious films. Where the Spinosaurus was during the events of TLW is suspicious too, the only clue given in the film is when Grant says that Spinosaurus wasn't on Ingen's list. Perhaps the worst part of JP3 is it's ending, which feels insanely rushed, and anti-climantic, almost as if the filmmakers said This is going on too long, lets wrap it up, but with a runtime just over 90 minutes, the abrupt conclusion seems strange, with the previous films being over two hours long. Jurassic Park 3 despite is faults, and there are multiple ones, is still an enjoyable flick for what it is, but it's a huge step down in terms of story, and character, and is just an unnecessary edition to the franchise. The story isn't very interesting, or inspired, and the only thing new in the film are the look of the raptors, and a few new dinosaurs. It's explained during a dinner scene with Grant, and Ellie that the raptors were far more intelligent than imagined, and could talk to each other, but much of this could be assumed in the previous films. Spinosaurus makes for a cool looking successor to T-Rex, but seems more like a movie monster than an animal, compared to T-Rex who while running around chasing\/eating people, had moments in both Jurassic Park, and The Lost World that showed a naturalistic side of them, like caring for the infant T-Rex. The only real advances in Jurassic Park 3 are technical ones, but effects aren't what makes a film great, it's the story, and characters that drive a film, and that wasn't strong enough in this entry of the Jurassic Park series.

Spielberg opted to not return to helm another Jurassic film, and directing duties were passed over to Joe Johnston. Jurassic Park 3 see's the return of Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant, from Jurassic Park. Laura Dern also returns as Ellie Sattler, but sadly in a less prominent role. The story for JP3 is quite simple, Grant is lured by adventurous couple Paul, & Amanda Kirby, played by William H. Macy & Tea Leoni, to fly over Isla Sorna, with Grant acting as their guide, for money. However the Kirby's are not rich, and lied to Grant so he could help them find their missing son Eric, who wen't missing weeks ago in a parasailing accident near the island. Of course things go wrong, the plane crashes leaving the Kirby's, Grant, his colleague Billy, and a few others stranded on the island. JP3 can only be enjoyed as a trilling dinosaur spectacle, but there isn't much of anything new, or interesting.There are some positives aspects in this film, Sam Neill is a fine actor, and he brings credibility to the film, and is still believable as the Grant character. While the rest of the characters aren't all that fleshed out, the film is well acted, with William H. Macy, and Sam Neill being the standouts. There's a few new dinosaurs, Spinosaurus being the main one. Spinosaurus is a neat dinosaur, and the roar for Spinosaurus is also well executed, and is distinctly different sounding from the now famous T- Rex roar. The animatronic dinosaurs\/CGI are once again well executed by Stan Winston's team, and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM). JP3 is the first film in the series to combine CGI dinosaurs along with practical ones in the same shot, and the blending between the two is well done. The Spinosaurus attack on the river is a thrilling scene, taking place in water, which hadn't been done. There is also a thrilling Pteranodon sequence, offering a ariel attack which hasn't been seen yet in the franchise. The scene is dimly lit, with fog, and creates the best sense of suspense in the movie. The music in the scene is probably my favorite bit of new music in the film. John Williams didn't score JP3, instead composer Don Davis best known for his work in The Matrix films, provides the music, and does a good job, creating new music that still fits stylistically within the franchise.Though there are positives in JP3 there are many negatives as well. One of the biggest ones I had was the screenwriters not having Grant, and Ellie as a couple. Instead they have a friendship type relationship, and Ellie has a child (with some random guy) who call's Grant the dinosaur man.

I had a very hard time following the action because all the characters were wearing the same clothes. Also, I was falling asleep in the second hour of the film.

That is the premise of this film so much as I could surmise. This particular man, the hero of the story (played by Jeff Bridges), fantasizes about light-grids, light-cycles and light-suits, so that's what he chooses to see when he goes into the computer. I personally would not fantasize about such an ugly looking place and such stupid things as techno-diskus tag and translucent neon squares, but the idea works nonetheless, as this is a character-driven movie possibly and this is what this character prefers.Things I liked about the movie are it's computer ideas, some of the colors (SOME of the colors), and just the whole general computer vibe of the production. The director definitely had his thinking cap on when directing some of the scenes of this movie.Now... are there faults? No. With that said... I would've liked for the movie to be a great deal shorter, so that the time when I watched it I wouldn't have fallen asleep so earlier into the movie and would have been able to see more about what happened, like maybe someone else gets to have a computer fantasy that was more to my liking, or maybe the computer goes haywire and the characters have to do some kind of techno-engineering.

I usually only a give 10\/10 rating when a movie is close to being perfect, when it does everything right. This is not the case with Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, a movie that is flawed, indeed. But the movie is incredibly original, it has a magical feel that I'm not sure many other movies have and has become a part of film and culture in general, that the movie deserves a 10\/10 rating.Let's talk about the flaws of the movie first. I understand the film is based on a children's book, but the characters in the film, particularly the parents of the children feel incredibly clichéd and extreme in their way of being. Veruca's father, for example he's a rich guy who gives his daughter absolutely anything she wants. And by anything I mean anything. He's at an extreme with his personality and so are all the other parents and their children. I get that this helps transmit an important message the film tries to send out that some children are spoiled little brats, but the reality is that they are only a reflection of their own parents, I get it. But I think they could have made it more subtle and not so much in your face like in this movie. But that's pretty much it as a movie flaw, but it takes a great part in the movie.Flaws aside, this movie is wonderful. It still looks amazing after nearly 45 years, the humor still holds up and it's just original as hell. Gene Wilder gives an iconic, hilarious performance that will NEVER be topped. Everything from the chocolate room with the chocolate river to the amazing songs in the movie feel magical. Another thing I love about this movie is the themes it handles. Like I mentioned earlier one of them is the raising kids to be spoiled brats theme and also what it means to be humble, like Charlie. The movie is so bizarre and even really scary at times, it is great.An amazing film, even if it has its flaws, they do not hide the fact that Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a film like no other and is, without a doubt, a classic.

All of those elements make Bad Boys one of better Action movies of the 1990s that is Michael Bay,Martin Lawrence and Will Smith at their best.Set in Miami,Florida,Bad Boys tells the story of Marcus Burnett(Martin Lawrence)and Mike Lowery(Will Smith)long time best friends who are also Cops and partners in the Miami Police department and are good at their jobs. When a large supply of Heroin is stolen from the police department Burnett and Lowery have to try and get back the dope while protecting and watching over a murder witness Julie(Tea Leoni)with Action,thrills and laughs coming from every corner.Released in 1995,Bad Boys is a terrific,Action-packed and hilarious Action-Comedy that looking back on the movie seemed like a big gamble at the time because it was the directorial debut of director Michael Bay with Martin Lawrence and Will Smith(who were both on very funny hit Sitcoms Martin and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air)in lead roles. But the gamble was a big pay off with Bad Boys grossing 141 Million dollars dollars worldwide at the Box Office and is one of the better Action-Buddy-Comedy films in the genre that is still watched to this very day and is one of my favorite Action-Comedies. Bad Boys is a movie that I have loved since I first saw it in theaters in 1995 and is a film that I watch to this very day whenever it's and is just a movie that is just pure,solid entertainment from start to finish for 2 whole hours with Action,thrills and laughs that come at a non-stop rate and is a film that grabs your attention with lots of style. While Bad Boys has an air of predictability and the storyline isn't very groundbreaking or revolutionary there is just something about Bad Boys that makes it so re-watchable after many viewings. The Action scenes in Bad Boys are terrific and memorable with plenty of gunfights,explosions and chases that are exciting and well-done like any Jerry Bruckheimer-Don Simpson production. All of the Bruckheimer and Simpson style is in this filmslow motion,flashy visual style and camera movements presented in all of it's glory in this film. Also,Miami,Florida in Bad Boys is stunning and gorgeous and is one of the best movies set in Miami because with Bad Boys you as a viewer are sucked into Miami and you are having fun while being thrilled. The Comedy and laughs in Bad Boys are just hilarious and funny with scenes and dialog that come alive thanks to the antics of Burnett and Lowery whether it's the back and forth bickering between them or the one-liners that are said. The thing that makes Bad Boys so entertaining all of these years what holds the movie together is the duo Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery. Unlike most Buddy movies or Action-Buddy-Comedy where the duo are put together and take time to gel together,Burnett and Lowery are already partners and best friends who know each other like the back of their hands. You feel like there is a love and brotherhood between the two and when there is always trouble they will be there for one another no matter what. We also see the differences between them in terms of their personal lives where Burnett is a married man with kids and Lowery is a bachelor with a lavish life style,but when they get into a shootout or chase the two manage to work together and get the job done. Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery are a great and funny duo that are in my opinion one of the better buddy cop duos in the Action-Comedy sub genre. The ending of Bad Boys is fantastic and great with plenty of Action and thrills that will leave viewers smiling and wanting more. A wonderful ending.The cast is wonderful. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are excellent and hilarious as Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery,with Lawrence and Smith being funny and having great chemistry. Tea Leoni is terrific,beautiful and sexy as Julie,a witness who's being watched by Burnett and Lowery. Tcheky Karyo is fantastic as Fouchet,the main villain. Joe Pantoliano is great as Captain Howard,Burnett and Lowery's commander. Theresa Randle is memorable and beautiful as Theresa Burnett,Marcus' wife. Vic Manni(Ferguson),Frank John Hughes(Casper),Nestor Serrano(Detective Sanchez),Julio Oscar Mechoso(Detective Ruiz),Marg Helgenberger(Captain Ailson Sinclair),Michael Imperioli(Jojo),Saverio Guerra(Chet),Mark Macauley(Noah),Karen Alexander(Max),Emmanuel Xuereb(Eddie Dominguez)and John Salley(Fletcher)give good performances as well.The direction by Michael Bay is wonderful and stylish,with Bay giving the movie a nice pace and a cool visual style using different angles and doing a great job with the Action scenes. Fine direction,Bay.The score by Mark Mancina is great,intense and matches the Action throughout the film. Good score,Mancina. There is also a terrific Hip-Hop\/R&B soundtrack with songs that goes with the energy of the film.In final word,if you love Michael Bay,Martin Lawrence,Will Smith,Action films or Action-Comedies,I highly suggest you see Bad Boys an excellent,thrilling and hilarious Action-Comedy that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10\/10.

Unlike most Buddy movies or Action-Buddy-Comedy where the duo are put together and take time to gel together,Burnett and Lowery are already partners and best friends who know each other like the back of their hands. You feel like there is a love and brotherhood between the two and when there is always trouble they will be there for one another no matter what. We also see the differences between them in terms of their personal lives where Burnett is a married man with kids and Lowery is a bachelor with a lavish life style,but when they get into a shootout or chase the two manage to work together and get the job done. Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery are a great and funny duo that are in my opinion one of the better buddy cop duos in the Action-Comedy sub genre. The ending of Bad Boys is fantastic and great with plenty of Action and thrills that will leave viewers smiling and wanting more. A wonderful ending.The cast is wonderful. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are excellent and hilarious as Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery,with Lawrence and Smith being funny and having great chemistry. Tea Leoni is terrific,beautiful and sexy as Julie,a witness who's being watched by Burnett and Lowery. Tcheky Karyo is fantastic as Fouchet,the main villain. Joe Pantoliano is great as Captain Howard,Burnett and Lowery's commander. Theresa Randle is memorable and beautiful as Theresa Burnett,Marcus' wife. Vic Manni(Ferguson),Frank John Hughes(Casper),Nestor Serrano(Detective Sanchez),Julio Oscar Mechoso(Detective Ruiz),Marg Helgenberger(Captain Ailson Sinclair),Michael Imperioli(Jojo),Saverio Guerra(Chet),Mark Macauley(Noah),Karen Alexander(Max),Emmanuel Xuereb(Eddie Dominguez)and John Salley(Fletcher)give good performances as well.The direction by Michael Bay is wonderful and stylish,with Bay giving the movie a nice pace and a cool visual style using different angles and doing a great job with the Action scenes. Fine direction,Bay.The score by Mark Mancina is great,intense and matches the Action throughout the film. Good score,Mancina. There is also a terrific Hip-Hop\/R&B soundtrack with songs that goes with the energy of the film.In final word,if you love Michael Bay,Martin Lawrence,Will Smith,Action films or Action-Comedies,I highly suggest you see Bad Boys an excellent,thrilling and hilarious Action-Comedy that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10\/10.

All of those elements make Bad Boys one of better Action movies of the 1990s that is Michael Bay,Martin Lawrence and Will Smith at their best.Set in Miami,Florida,Bad Boys tells the story of Marcus Burnett(Martin Lawrence)and Mike Lowery(Will Smith)long time best friends who are also Cops and partners in the Miami Police department and are good at their jobs. When a large supply of Heroin is stolen from the police department Burnett and Lowery have to try and get back the dope while protecting and watching over a murder witness Julie(Tea Leoni)with Action,thrills and laughs coming from every corner.Released in 1995,Bad Boys is a terrific,Action-packed and hilarious Action-Comedy that looking back on the movie seemed like a big gamble at the time because it was the directorial debut of director Michael Bay with Martin Lawrence and Will Smith(who were both on very funny hit Sitcoms Martin and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air)in lead roles. But the gamble was a big pay off with Bad Boys grossing 141 Million dollars dollars worldwide at the Box Office and is one of the better Action-Buddy-Comedy films in the genre that is still watched to this very day and is one of my favorite Action-Comedies. Bad Boys is a movie that I have loved since I first saw it in theaters in 1995 and is a film that I watch to this very day whenever it's and is just a movie that is just pure,solid entertainment from start to finish for 2 whole hours with Action,thrills and laughs that come at a non-stop rate and is a film that grabs your attention with lots of style. While Bad Boys has an air of predictability and the storyline isn't very groundbreaking or revolutionary there is just something about Bad Boys that makes it so re-watchable after many viewings. The Action scenes in Bad Boys are terrific and memorable with plenty of gunfights,explosions and chases that are exciting and well-done like any Jerry Bruckheimer-Don Simpson production. All of the Bruckheimer and Simpson style is in this filmslow motion,flashy visual style and camera movements presented in all of it's glory in this film. Also,Miami,Florida in Bad Boys is stunning and gorgeous and is one of the best movies set in Miami because with Bad Boys you as a viewer are sucked into Miami and you are having fun while being thrilled.

The Direction and Score tell the story of the film with the care and affection for the history it portrays it almost feels like a documentary not a film! Like the Color Purple the film has an idea a theme that runs through the whole film the theme of tolerance the idea of what are we prepared to tolerate and suffer in order to achieve the dreams we want the dreams we aspire to achieve the future of all man kind! I really feel strongly about the film as much as I do about the Color Purple they are underrated Masterpieces and do not get talked about any more among the Master of Film's filmography because they have not done well with awards or not gained the critical acclaim they deserve! Empire of the Sun is the Best Picture of 1987 for a number of reasons the inspiring themes of soaring airplanes and the dreams we all share the recurring motifs of memories that Jim has like the haunting melody that his mother plays on the piano similar to Celie and Nettie's hand clapping motif and song in the Color Purple which connects Celie and Nettie together the Haunting piano melody that Jim's Mother plays connects Jim to his mother he knows that he is safe and well and that is very powerful for me that a simple piano motif can bond and connect someone together! The film has a recurring theme of showing acts of malevolent evil and what the power of evil can and will do if necessary there are threats of danger and you see many sequences of danger and hurtful acts of evil which affects Jim and the people around him as the threat of evil increases and the hope decreases as Jim knows he feels anger for the evil around him but he never speaks his emotions the film shows it through the simple power of emotion and Jim's body language he really changes throughout the film he cares and respects all who know him he has a friend called Basie who he aspires to and when Jim explains the emotion of the heartbreaking experiences he has gone through throughout the war which are intertwined with the wonderful experiences of the planes soaring across the sky it feels heartbreaking and wonderfully overwhelming at the same time! Like the Color Purple you feel the overwhelming force of the ending as all hope is restored when the whole atmosphere of the whole world returns to normal no feeling of darkness peril or danger worries Jim at the end he is with his mother he is safe and well but there is a sense of traumatic memories that will never change the heartbreaking sequences of people reviving other people back to life which people should never have to do in the first place but they have to in order to survive the traumatic horrors of war! Last note I want to say that The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun are heartbreaking companion pieces and they need to be loved and appreciated more and we can share the Color Purple and Empire of the Sun with the world!

Who would have thought that 49 years after the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 that the city by the bay would be attacked by a giant octopus who was definitely much bigger than King Kong and equally as high as the Empire State Building. But this squid with the giant plunger like suckers on his tentacles (which left manhole sized marks on the sandy beaches of the Pacific Coast) could literally climb up out of the ocean, hugging the Embarcadero and reaching his tentacles far down Market Street to cause all sort of disaster. Considering that MacDonald's character might have been only in her early 80's when the event with the octopus occurred, she very well could have witnessed it, and as the rubble fell, screamed, Oh no, not again! This is a very enjoyable science fiction monster movie, a product of the nuclear age and a reminder of what real life science might be capable of. Faith Domergue, once the protégée of Howard Hughes during his executive years as head of RKO, is a very intelligent scientist working with the military on the obvious presence of something lurking under the sea. Kenneth Tobey is the Navy commander she strikes up a friendship with, and fortunately, the romantic element of the movie is underplayed as Domergue is seriously a 50's career woman, still beautiful and desirable, but determined to find a way to stop this beast with eight tentacles before she deals with the beast with two arms.She explains this isn't the first case of a giant octopus coming out of the sea, having found evidence of such creatures back in the 14th century off the coast of Denmark after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. It's obvious that these creatures lie dormant in the outer reaches of the ocean floor, only rising when disturbed. This monster makes a dramatic entrance, taking down a raised submarine and pretty much killing the entire crew. Those who laugh at its possible existence end up regretting it (if they live to remember it), and those driving down California State Highway 480 will surely get a visual to remember, if they make it past Market Street.Excellent special effects make this one of the best of the nuclear age science fiction monster movies with decent performances and a brisk pace. It isn't nearly as good as 20 Million Miles to Earth which humanized the monster, but it is still gripping. Who will ever forget the octopus coming out of the sea and revealing not only its tentacles but its huge head as it prepares to destroy a submarine, its sudden appearance on the beach and its efforts to take down the Golden Gate Bridge before it makes its way over to the Embarcadero. San Francisco has had many car chase movies and several films about its different shake-ups, but to see something of this size taking down some of the most famous west coast tourist attractions is a wonderful movie memory to cherish and to enthrall science fiction fans for decades to come.

Who would have thought that 49 years after the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 that the city by the bay would be attacked by a giant octopus who was definitely much bigger than King Kong and equally as high as the Empire State Building. But this squid with the giant plunger like suckers on his tentacles (which left manhole sized marks on the sandy beaches of the Pacific Coast) could literally climb up out of the ocean, hugging the Embarcadero and reaching his tentacles far down Market Street to cause all sort of disaster. Considering that MacDonald's character might have been only in her early 80's when the event with the octopus occurred, she very well could have witnessed it, and as the rubble fell, screamed, Oh no, not again! This is a very enjoyable science fiction monster movie, a product of the nuclear age and a reminder of what real life science might be capable of. Faith Domergue, once the protégée of Howard Hughes during his executive years as head of RKO, is a very intelligent scientist working with the military on the obvious presence of something lurking under the sea. Kenneth Tobey is the Navy commander she strikes up a friendship with, and fortunately, the romantic element of the movie is underplayed as Domergue is seriously a 50's career woman, still beautiful and desirable, but determined to find a way to stop this beast with eight tentacles before she deals with the beast with two arms.She explains this isn't the first case of a giant octopus coming out of the sea, having found evidence of such creatures back in the 14th century off the coast of Denmark after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. It's obvious that these creatures lie dormant in the outer reaches of the ocean floor, only rising when disturbed. This monster makes a dramatic entrance, taking down a raised submarine and pretty much killing the entire crew. Those who laugh at its possible existence end up regretting it (if they live to remember it), and those driving down California State Highway 480 will surely get a visual to remember, if they make it past Market Street.Excellent special effects make this one of the best of the nuclear age science fiction monster movies with decent performances and a brisk pace. It isn't nearly as good as 20 Million Miles to Earth which humanized the monster, but it is still gripping. Who will ever forget the octopus coming out of the sea and revealing not only its tentacles but its huge head as it prepares to destroy a submarine, its sudden appearance on the beach and its efforts to take down the Golden Gate Bridge before it makes its way over to the Embarcadero. San Francisco has had many car chase movies and several films about its different shake-ups, but to see something of this size taking down some of the most famous west coast tourist attractions is a wonderful movie memory to cherish and to enthrall science fiction fans for decades to come.

The first thing is that this was made with the wrong intentions, gone are almost all the horror elements that made this series great to begin with and instead they just went down the comedy route, the intention was that they wanted this to appeal to all ages and make Freddy a pop culture icon, which he already was, so why they decided to go down this route is beyond me. But what I did like about this though is that we got to delve deeper into Freddy's back-story which was rather interesting and the fact that he's wiped out all the teen population of Springwood, leaving only the adults was another creepy factor, but ultimately goes nowhere and what really lets it down is that it just gets way too stupid and over the top, with so many desperate attempts at humour and everything mostly failing, the lack of deaths isn't a problem, it's just that they were done so poorly and uninteresting, just style over substance. It just seems that more went on the set pieces than any actual tension or action, and to be honest they look rather dull and bland, and not filmed with any flair whatsoever.The cast this time aren't all that interesting, due to not enough time given to them. Lisa Zane was decent in her turn as social worker Maggie, although nothing is done with her during the first hour and when it turns out she's Freddy's daughter, things do pick up and overall she proves to be a decent match for him. Shon Greenblatt as John Doe was okay as the last remaining kid from Springwood, but sadly his story arc goes nowhere as he's dispatched way too early. Breckin Meyer does okay as the stoner as do Ricky Dean Morgan, but again their characters suffers from a poor script and quickly become disposable. Lezlie Deane had potential as the troubled tough girl and Yaphet Kotto is great as always. Of course Robert Englund is brilliant as ever and is probably going through the motions at this point, but he can only do what's written on paper, but he's still a legend as always.All in all glad that this one wasn't the final nightmare, and the series would redeem itself, but this does bring things to a full circle and does have some interesting plot points, but way too many were rushed and unresolved.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"1 July 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Science Fiction is inherently strange, and it seems like the further back you go, the stranger the movies are, perhaps none stranger than Logan's Run. This film is considered by many to be the one of the best science fiction films of all time, so I decide to watch it for the most recent classics review. My first impression, I've seen weird before, but Logan's Run goes way beyond that, to a point of incomprehensible. After a nuclear war, a group of citizens in what was once Washington D.C., live in a self-sustained domed city. Population control is a big problem, so the builders of the city have convinced the citizen's that at the age of 30, they must enter a device known as carrousel, which will decide if they should be renewed or eliminated, the only thing is, no one has ever been renewed. A group of citizens has figured this out and run from carrousel. They are hunted by a group of officers known as sandmen. Logan 5 (Michael York) is one these sandmen, who goes undercover to try to infiltrate the runners, As his time comes closer, Logan 5 realizes they're right and he joins them, hence the name Logan's Run. The premise here is ingenious and at first I thought I'd enjoy this film, but as it went on, the pace slowed, the quality deteriorated, and the story became ridiculous. For example, after exiting the cave, the worst looking robot I've ever seen, named Box, who looks like a child wearing a box, carries on for fifteen minutes about plankton from the sea, and at that point I almost turned it off. Michael York, better know from his Austin Powers fame, stars and is actually very good, (even though it is never explained why this British guy is in a D.C. city, surrounded by Americans). York was entertaining but the rest of the cast was not, in particular Jenny Agutter, who just complained and carried on the whole time. Farrah Fawcett also makes an appears in the film, in a role that amounts to little more than eye candy. In my opinion, she would have made a much more convincing Jessica. Logan's Run starts out as a terrific futuristic adventure and looks like it's going to earn every bit of acclaim it received, but as the film progresses, it just gets worse and worse to the point of being unwatchable.
