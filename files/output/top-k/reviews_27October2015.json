It's an undisputed horror classic that has lived on since it's slightly anticlimactic, ill received release back in the 80's (people didn't know a good fright flick when they saw it back then, I guess). Nevertheless, it's a heart stopping odyssey of ambient antarctic unease, sickening, squirm inducing practical effects, and a veil of impending danger and paranoia that blankets both the characters and the viewer, like the thick drifts of snow that blanket the screen to gorgeous effect. The story by now is timeless a team of antarctic researchers in a remote location come across a gigantic spacecraft buried in the tundra, and unearth a grotesque, frozen creature that upon being thawed, wreaks havoc on them and their facility. It's an imitator, this monster, and can hide in plain sight, within the flesh and blood of any one of their crew. This gives way to extreme distrust, mental unraveling and mutiny as it turns them against one another. For me there's nothing quite as iconic as the opening Ennio Morricone's ominous, rhythmical score kicks in as we see two hysterical Norwegians in a helicopter, Chasing a dog across the frozen terrain. It's one of the most dazzling, evocative entrances to a fright flick ever filmed. Kurt Russell, in his whiskered, macho glory plays Macready, the head of the team. Russell is always solid, especially in genre stuff, and he's almost as distinct and iconic here as his Snake Plissken character. T.K. Carter, Donald Moffat, Keith David Wilford Brimley and more round out the rest of the team, and I won't mention standouts because they're all just fantastic and each play their part to a T. A huge highlight is the gruesome creature effects. When the it tries to imitate something and messes up, the result is a grossly misshapen slab of slimy nondescript gore, guaranteed to freak and gross you out in equal measures. I won't spoil anything with specifics, but the dog kennel and defibrillator scenes are time capsule worthy and should be shown in special effects makeup schools as a shining example. Carpenter pulls off the second absolutely flawless horror movie of his career with this one, not an easy feat, especially in this genre.

The demand by studio-heads to spit a new franchised horror film into theaters in or around the fall season was absolutely incredible during this time, and as a result, you got a saturated marketplace that got to see Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, and Michael Myers, sometimes all in the same year, leading to a massive lack of interest and concern by the time the franchises decided to conclude. Then there's the element of these films constantly swapping writers and directors at the end of every film; this particular factor is notable for the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, which only had one particular writer\/director show up to do a film more than once and that was Wes Craven on both the original and the last film Wes Craven's New Nightmare.The combination of these two effects lead not only to a rushed quality with each of these Nightmare sequels, which some can overcome but others cannot, and the element of narrative logic and the interworkings of the world being manipulated to fit the differing needs of the respective writers and directors. The road of the Nightmare franchise has been anything but smooth and comfortable and A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 The Dream Child is the second time the series has effectively pulled itself up from its bootstraps after a slight deviation in quality.The film reinstates its focus on Alice (Lisa Wilcox), the lead from the previous film, The Dream Master, who is now dating Dan (Danny Hassle) from the original film. After going a long period of time without being haunted by Freddy, Alice finds herself nearly drowning when her shower's drain becomes clogged and begins overflowing with water in the opening sequence of the film. This leads to Alice being absorbed into Freddy Krueger's (Robert Englund) vicious and unpredictable dream world once again, with her lucid abilities still unable to save her except for in the nick of time when she transports back to reality. The dreams of Alice and Dan have taken on much more vivid, almost Gothic\/Victorian representations of distorted reality, which eventually lead to Alice becoming pregnant with the dream child, who is known as Jacob (Whit Hertford) and seen through Alice's visions. Worried about the safety - and sanity - of her child, Alice works, yet again, to try and stop Freddy before he takes a toll on haunting others, including her fragile son.As stated, A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 The Dream Child takes on a brand new stylistic design that director Stephen Hopkins and cinematographer Peter Levy employ with exquisite detail and frightening buildup. The dream sequences carry a much more detailed and lucid vibe, ranking comfortably alongside Dream Warriors, the third film, for the some of the best of the series. The scene where Freddy manipulates Dan's control and perception whilst driving a vehicle all in the matter of a few minutes winds up being a wickedly effective fright in terms of making the audience feel like the entire scene is out of their control. Also intensely effective is the scene where Alice's friend Greta (Erika Anderson) winds up victim to Freddy's games in a violent, brutal way at a dinner party also works to show off the elaborate dream sequence setups in addition to the amalgamation of Freddy's ability to be both a comical and sinister force.What I formerly saw as a dichotomous approach to Freddy - in a sense where he had to either be unadulterated evil or comical and cheeky - writer Leslie Boehm blends to give us a Freddy we haven't seen before. That is an unpredictable force that exercises both comic and horror tendencies through his ability to spout one-liners and give you the ride of your life in more ways than one whilst trapping you in layered, scary dream sequences that showcase darker imagery than ever before.On these notes, A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 The Dream Child works very well. It disregards the more unbridled, primary comic elements of its former film to continue to assert Freddy's role of being an ugly, menacing character. The story at hand may show signs of the franchise panting and wheezing to an uncertain close, but the costume\/set design show that this series had more inventive visual schemes that could've materialized and continued for much longer than the franchise itself did, even in the face of alternative directions and frequently changing writers and directors.Starring Lisa Wilcox, Robert Englund, Danny Hassle, Whit Hertford, and Erika Anderson.

While some of the further entries are well done (#3 is a standout), this first one gives us Freddy Krueger at his simplest and most menacing, before the sequels saw him calcified into a one liner wise guy. Here he keeps the talking to a minimum, letting his grotesque presence itself, and otherworldy powers do most of he communication. Robert Englund creates a boogeyman that's perhaps the most distinct, specefic of the slasher bunch, as he's not just a silent, formidable masked dude, but an actual character with personality and better, a sense of humour. Freddy, for those who haven't seen this (shame) was a child killer in life, burned alive by the parents of his victims, and haunting the dreams of their children. Heather Langenkamp is striking as Nancy, the resilient one of the group. Amanda Weiss plays her friend Tina, who is not so fortunate and suffers torment at the hands of Freddy in a feverish, impressive early sequence. Johnny Depp in his first ever film role plays Nancy's boyfriend Glen, a shallow goofball as most dudes in 80's horror movies tend to be. Nancy's sheriff father (John Saxon) is skeptical at best, and the kids find themselves alone and at odds with this ticked off, cackling dream demon. It's special effects heavy as well, as Freddy manipulates his world to terrify them and conjure up all kinds of creepy horrors. Langenkamp has an easy likability, fragile yet unflinching, qualities that often are often lacking from horror protagonists, but is nice to see here and makes her relatable. Englund has a ball his first time around as Freddy, and as per usual with the first film of any horror franchise, less is more. He's used minimally at first, mostly as sound before sight, but when they do see him he shakes their nerves up pretty good.

Englund has a ball his first time around as Freddy, and as per usual with the first film of any horror franchise, less is more. He's used minimally at first, mostly as sound before sight, but when they do see him he shakes their nerves up pretty good. A horror classic, and the second corner of the slasher trifecta I mentioned previously. ","genre":"Horror"}]
