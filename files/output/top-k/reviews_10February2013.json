This makes him popular with everybody apart from the miserly Mr. Potter who doesn't like to see the people who were paying him to rent slums buying their own houses. The years pass and George gets married and has children; he isn't rich but he is content; then one day Potter gets the opportunity to ruin George; thinking the only way he can help his family is to kill himself for the insurance we get to the point the film started.

John Rambo is too much a cartoon character like Flippy the green bear from Happy Tree Friends. Yes, I push it, Rambo. Before the over-kills, glorious violence that First Blood Part II and III gave us, there was First Blood. A movie with violence, but also very smart written with dark tone somber subtext message. First Blood was based on the book by David Morrell inspired by real-life post-Vietnam war era backlash against veterans. The movie by Ted Kotcheff seem like a modern day PG-13 version of the book. I'd love to see them remake First Blood in a contemporary setting and make it a little bit more hard core like the novel. Plus the ending to novel is shocking. Still, it's a good rated R film as it is. John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is a Vietnam vet whom comes upon the town of Hope, looking for some food after mourning the lost of his war-time friend. Seeing him as a drifter on the road, Hope's sheriff, Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) confronts Rambo offers him a lift to the town limits, hinting strongly that drifters aren't welcome here. Note in the U.S., some local officials encourage vagrants to move away instead of arresting them so it's a common theme here. While the movie wants to put Teasle as the bad guy guided to that conclusion by the storyline, if you pay attention to what Teasle is doing, you can see he isn't. He knows his citizens by name. He is a man of law and order. He doesn't back down to Rambo even though he knows he is superior to him. His motives are to keep his town peaceful and he thinks he is a threat, which somewhat came true. So he was justified in a way. He doesn't arrest him, at first. He knows Rambo might be trouble so he even gives him a lift out of town where he would be out of his jurisdiction. Will Tealse was doing his job. When Rambo politely declines Sheriff Teasle's suggestion by showing back into town, Rambo finds himself under arrest. While in custody, he isn't really treated right by the cops. Teasle says if he had a problem, Rambo could come to him and he would of reprimanded the officers. The police officers may have gone over board after he was in custody like trying to shave him. The sheriff officers weren't even that bad. David Caruso's character was the sympathetic cop too, but he's still an idiot. Just waiting for him to put on glasses and the CSI Miami music kicks in. It sent Rambo off, due to reminding him of Vietnam torture flashbacks. He then escape, commits several felonies batteries, grand theft auto twice, kidnapping, animal cruelty, speeding wreck-less and endangerment innocent lives with an automatic weapon and arson. All that because Teasle wouldn't let him get a cheeseburger in his town, gees. Rambo heads off road, with the entire police department on his trail in the forest. When his skills prove to be too much for Sheriff Teasle's men, the military arrives - led by Rambo's former commander in Vietnam, Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), whose loyalties are divided between the man he trained and those seeking to bring him down.

John Rambo is too much a cartoon character like Flippy the green bear from Happy Tree Friends. Yes, I push it, Rambo. Before the over-kills, glorious violence that First Blood Part II and III gave us, there was First Blood. A movie with violence, but also very smart written with dark tone somber subtext message. First Blood was based on the book by David Morrell inspired by real-life post-Vietnam war era backlash against veterans. The movie by Ted Kotcheff seem like a modern day PG-13 version of the book. I'd love to see them remake First Blood in a contemporary setting and make it a little bit more hard core like the novel. Plus the ending to novel is shocking. Still, it's a good rated R film as it is. John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is a Vietnam vet whom comes upon the town of Hope, looking for some food after mourning the lost of his war-time friend. Seeing him as a drifter on the road, Hope's sheriff, Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) confronts Rambo offers him a lift to the town limits, hinting strongly that drifters aren't welcome here. Note in the U.S., some local officials encourage vagrants to move away instead of arresting them so it's a common theme here. While the movie wants to put Teasle as the bad guy guided to that conclusion by the storyline, if you pay attention to what Teasle is doing, you can see he isn't. He knows his citizens by name. He is a man of law and order. He doesn't back down to Rambo even though he knows he is superior to him. His motives are to keep his town peaceful and he thinks he is a threat, which somewhat came true. So he was justified in a way. He doesn't arrest him, at first. He knows Rambo might be trouble so he even gives him a lift out of town where he would be out of his jurisdiction. Will Tealse was doing his job. When Rambo politely declines Sheriff Teasle's suggestion by showing back into town, Rambo finds himself under arrest. While in custody, he isn't really treated right by the cops. Teasle says if he had a problem, Rambo could come to him and he would of reprimanded the officers. The police officers may have gone over board after he was in custody like trying to shave him. The sheriff officers weren't even that bad. David Caruso's character was the sympathetic cop too, but he's still an idiot. Just waiting for him to put on glasses and the CSI Miami music kicks in. It sent Rambo off, due to reminding him of Vietnam torture flashbacks. He then escape, commits several felonies batteries, grand theft auto twice, kidnapping, animal cruelty, speeding wreck-less and endangerment innocent lives with an automatic weapon and arson. All that because Teasle wouldn't let him get a cheeseburger in his town, gees. Rambo heads off road, with the entire police department on his trail in the forest. When his skills prove to be too much for Sheriff Teasle's men, the military arrives - led by Rambo's former commander in Vietnam, Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), whose loyalties are divided between the man he trained and those seeking to bring him down.

Although the characters are completely flat and lack any development, the mix of stereotypes and qualities provides an entertaining mix.The viewer cannot help but pity the poor, helpless survivors. Frequent broadcasts reveal an ongoing national resistance, with the help of doctors, NASA and the police force. Conversely, our survivors are isolated with nothing more than a shotgun, a few slugs and an array of very hate-able useless individuals who slow down the overall progress of the group.Another welcomed theme throughout the movie was the gradual reclusion of Ben. Venturing from the country, he seeks refuge in the farm house and is eventually driven to a dim basement shared with a monster child. By this stage, sheer desperation is the only thing left to cling to.Entering this film, I knew that the previous viewing of countless zombie films would provide prejudice. Half of the fear of living dead in film has always been, at least for me, their visual awe. A man chasing another man is generally nothing special, but it is when he only has half a face.

It's always hard making a good sequel to a good movie but this one here succeeds in large part because we've got a pretty strong story, a great action director and of course the terrific cast who helps keep it moving. What really stands out about this second film is just the fact that every action scene is really magnified and this starts from the very first one and it doesn't let up until the very end. Like the first film this one here has one action scene after another and they all manage to work. Some of the more memorable ones including the tense ending but there's also a great sequence where a group of soldiers are pretty much caught in a crossfire during a set-up. Willis is certainly in good form here as he handles the action scenes without a problem and best of all is that dry humor that is used perfectly here. He not only gets some good one-liners but you can't help but enjoy this character and the life Willis brings to it. The supporting cast here is terrific with Sadler making for an excellent villain and it's always fun to see Nero even though he's not in too much of the film. Bonnie Bedella, William Atherton and Reginald VelJohnson make appearances and are fine. We also get some great work from John Amos, Dennis Franz and Fred Dalton Thompson. Another terrific supporting character is the snow. Yes, there's so much snow here that you can't help but enjoy the added winter touch and it certainly adds some extra tension to all the stuff going on.

What can be said of Vincent Gallo's efforts as a director? The Brown Bunny outraged many crowds out there not only because of its infamous real sex scene but because the work itself seemed an egoistical attempt to prove something to someone and that was the director trying to impress himself. It's quite pretentious, very empty but manageable, watchable. Now, the beloved Buffalo '66 appears to have more logic, more sense and a good structure with its transitions from one scene to the next one, there's an artist moving and creating those moments and sometimes everything flows so easily, so it can't be art, this Jekyll is getting dominated by Mr. Hyde, the mindless entertainment. What's the verdict? But let us go down with the story Gallo plays Billy, a convict just released from prison who has two plans on his mind to kill the man responsible for his arrest and to pay a visit to his parents (Anjelica Huston and Ben Gazzara) of whom he doesn't have much of a good relationship, and during those years arrested he sent letters pretending he was working for the government on a secret project and that he also got married. The latter plan is absurd because he doesn't know anyone, he's deeply immersed in himself so what does he do? He kidnaps a girl (Christina Ricci) and forces her to be his wife while he's visiting his folks. All she has to do is to make him look nice before them, show that they are a loving couple. And who could have thought such plan not only worked out but also Billy got himself a bonus the girl fell for him despite all of his cruelties and commands.What does Buffalo '66 is trying to impose with its apparently innocuous speech? One direction it's an unconventional love story with everything to go wrong but in the end it turns out alright. Another deeper perspective, which also includes the fore-mentioned view, merely says to us that misogynists, homophobes and scums of the earth deserve some love and understanding and they'll get it in the most strange of ways. That's what I get from watching this. Billy treats everybody bad, people seem to worth nothing for him (the only guy of whom he doesn't say a word and keeps with his head down through the whole time is the character played by Mickey Rourke) and he keeps going with this trend for on and on. Basically, with this movie Gallo is giving hope to many idiots out there who think acting like his character will give them something truly rewarding, they'll find true love...someday!If that's the way it's not supposed to be read, then why all the gigantic love this movie has? The story isn't appealing (except here and there), takes a whole lot of time to take over and to make us involved. At the top of all the script is annoying as hell with its characters, specially Billy, repeating their lines and situations over and over. What's up with the bathroom thing? All the time he needed a bathroom. Just look at me. Just look at me or Goon! Goon! and even We are a couple that doesn't touch. and always getting something involving chocolate. When Ricci's character was offered to have something brought to her by Billy, before she answered I said to myself If she says chocolate once again I'll give thumbs down to this movie!.

In this western, Eastwood plays the role of a once murderous outlaw named William Munny. Will is partnered by his old friend, Ned Logan, played by Morgan Freeman and The Schofield Kid, portrayed by Jaimz Woolvett. In a typical Wild West setting, these three set off to collect on a payment being offered by prostitutes in the remote town of Big Whiskey. To receive this payment, Will has to break a promise to his deceased wife of not returning to the man he used to be. Standing in Will's way is the law of Big Whiskey, led by the Sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman). The Sheriff was a notorious lawman from Kansas who has experienced life, and has settled down in this quiet town to build a home. This movie is laid out brilliantly by the editor, and tells a story of corruption in this small town, and the history behind the man headed to Big Whiskey to make wrongs right. Unforgiven is based on the truth that a person will eventually get what they deserve. Set in a time were women are poorly represented by the law, the prostitutes in Big Whiskey are forced to take the law into their own hands after violence is brought to them. Unable to fight the corruption on their own, they put a bounty on those responsible for the crime. This brings assassins, killers, and lowlifes from all over to this quiet town. As the plot continues to thicken and crimes are committed, Little Bill is up against a wall to save his town from these assassins. Little Bill returns to the notorious lawman he once was, leaving the audience unsure of which side of the law he represents. Seeking desperate measures to rid his town of these outlaws, Little Bill captures one and uses torture to get information. This leaves no option for William, except to ignore his promises to his wife and return to the man he once was, leading this film into one of the most dramatic climaxes I have ever witnessed. These scenes, portrayed by the beautiful technique of this screen writer, added elements into the climax that audiences are not accustomed to witnessing. A dark, rainy, and quiet atmosphere leads the viewer into a heart pounding finale. Clint Eastwood is remarkable, as usual, and Gene Hackman plays a character we love to hate. With two brilliant lead actors this film, Morgan Freeman plays an awesome supporting role making his character, and this movie, unforgettable.

This was a story with a interesting premise but an uneven execution.In California town in 1984 Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a straight A-Level student and at the age of 16 he is already a High School student. When studying the Holocaust he discovers one of his neighbours, Arthur Denker (Ian McKellen) is actually a SS death camp commander and a wanted war criminal. Instead of telling the police Todd blackmails Denker to tell him stories about the Holocaust. Both character slowly end up playing mind games and powerplays with each other and awakening their darks demons within them.The basic idea had a lot of a potential and there were many different directions it could have gone. It could have been the boy finds out about the war criminal and the turns into an examination of the nature of guilt and evil, explore who is really the evil one in the relationship, a look a modern Nazism. The other way it could have gone is the boy could found the secret and does not know where to turn or finds its out the secret after befriending the man.The direction Apt Pupil starred off well enough as it better of wits between Todd and Denker but it slowly turns into more of a horror movie as both characters start to display the behaviour of emerging serial killers. It felt like this was a film wanting to be a thriller and horror more the being a more in depth study which it should have been and what Singer is more than capable of. It was the screenplay that lets the film down with forced moments (i.e. how Denker was discovered by the authorities) to some unrealistic character development.Renfro was a very stiff actor in the lead role and was a truly unlikeable character to lead the film. There was no real charm to him nor the charisma that a character like that needed to make you to make you care about what happened to him. But we were luckily were compensated with an excellent and dark performance from McKellen, playing a character who wants a quiet life and forced to relive his memories and by doing this his old dark and sadistic side.Singer is of course a talented director and he does bring some moments of visual flair involving dreams. There are some creepy looking scenes and the one where Todd was in the shower, the camera pans and changes filter was very well. The pacing is right throughout, Singer and his editor new when to speed up or slow down when needed and the scenes between Todd and Denker were filled with tension. A knife could have cut it as the two men tried to best the other one.There are themes about obsession, violence and the dark nature of humanity. A particular idea that was well done was how people can dream and be interest of violence and the darker elements of life but very different when actually confronted with it.Apt Pupil is the weakest film from Singer's filmography I have seen but it still a well made and compelling film.

Audrey Hepburn's charm shines in this 1953 Oscar winning film. This coming of age movie reminds us to take time for ourselves to remember who we really are and to follow our hearts once in a while. Hepburn plays a sheltered young Princess Anne whose life is structured and planned down to the very last second by her royal staff. While on the Rome stop of a goodwill tour of Europe, the stress of her controlled life finally gets to her. She is given a shot to help calm her down and sleep but before feeling the full effects of the drug, she sneaks out of her room and into the night streets of Rome. Gregory Peck plays a tall dark and handsome struggling American reporter stationed in Rome named Joe Bradley. After a late night of cards, he stumbles upon Princess Anne sleeping on the streets. He attempts to help the young lady home, not yet knowing of her royal status, but realizes she is far to intoxicated to help herself so he brings her to his apartment to sleep it off on his couch. It's not until the next day that Joe realizes that he has the biggest story of his career sleeping in his apartment. He encourages Anne to spend the day out doing everything and anything she has ever wanted to do, all the while Anne thinks she has fooled Joe into thinking she is Anne Smith, the student, but Joe's intentions are to sell his princess story to the press. As the day goes by, he realizes that this private day they have shared means more to him than the price he would get for the story.Spoiler!Anne's day in Rome with Joe helps her discover herself in more ways than she expected. She lives, laughs, and loves her way through Rome with Joe by her side. Most of the scenes with Anne and Joe are shot from a lower angle, I believe this was done to make Joe appear taller and more like a protector to Anne. But, like Cinderella, Anne rushes back by midnight to her royal responsibilities and she must say goodbye to her beloved Joe. In the closing scene, Joe is walking out of the royal press conference being held in a lavish and large room. You see the empty throne over his shoulder getting further and further away. He stops at the end of the room and looks over his shoulder. This signifies the distance and impossibility of his relationship with Princess Anne. The movie is only shot over a 3 day period but you feel as though you have witnessed Anne grow up in front of your eyes from a spoiled Princess to a lovely young woman.

Audrey Hepburn's charm shines in this 1953 Oscar winning film. This coming of age movie reminds us to take time for ourselves to remember who we really are and to follow our hearts once in a while. Hepburn plays a sheltered young Princess Anne whose life is structured and planned down to the very last second by her royal staff. While on the Rome stop of a goodwill tour of Europe, the stress of her controlled life finally gets to her. She is given a shot to help calm her down and sleep but before feeling the full effects of the drug, she sneaks out of her room and into the night streets of Rome. Gregory Peck plays a tall dark and handsome struggling American reporter stationed in Rome named Joe Bradley. After a late night of cards, he stumbles upon Princess Anne sleeping on the streets. He attempts to help the young lady home, not yet knowing of her royal status, but realizes she is far to intoxicated to help herself so he brings her to his apartment to sleep it off on his couch. It's not until the next day that Joe realizes that he has the biggest story of his career sleeping in his apartment. He encourages Anne to spend the day out doing everything and anything she has ever wanted to do, all the while Anne thinks she has fooled Joe into thinking she is Anne Smith, the student, but Joe's intentions are to sell his princess story to the press. As the day goes by, he realizes that this private day they have shared means more to him than the price he would get for the story.Spoiler!Anne's day in Rome with Joe helps her discover herself in more ways than she expected. She lives, laughs, and loves her way through Rome with Joe by her side. Most of the scenes with Anne and Joe are shot from a lower angle, I believe this was done to make Joe appear taller and more like a protector to Anne. But, like Cinderella, Anne rushes back by midnight to her royal responsibilities and she must say goodbye to her beloved Joe. In the closing scene, Joe is walking out of the royal press conference being held in a lavish and large room. You see the empty throne over his shoulder getting further and further away. He stops at the end of the room and looks over his shoulder. This signifies the distance and impossibility of his relationship with Princess Anne. The movie is only shot over a 3 day period but you feel as though you have witnessed Anne grow up in front of your eyes from a spoiled Princess to a lovely young woman.

I'm sure if I had seen this in 1970 that it would have felt revolutionary, unique and heartbreaking. Having seen it now, the problem is that countless other films have copied it and paid homage to it. The film absolutely relies on the chemistry of its two stars and you absolutely can't deny that. Both characters are very well written with distinct and vivid personalities that just click so well together. The story behind Love Story is simplistic enough and I was actually surprised at how simple it was. Perhaps it was the years of build up and discussion about the film being a classic that left me a little underwhelmed. But I even found the major turning point in the film (I don't want to blatantly give it away in case someone actually doesn't know) but I found it completely anti-climatic. I knew what was going to happen going into it but I didn't find it nearly as heart wrenching as I thought. I've heard people say that Love Story is the greatest romance film ever, and always have a Kleenex but I simply wasn't that moved. Was it good? Yes it was good but I don't quite see the same level of quality everyone raves about.Ali MacGraw is beautiful, sassy, full of life and perfect in her role. Nowadays I think her role might be considered stereotypical and predictable. You know, she's the wild and vivacious woman that tames the playboy. However, for its time I'm sure she was a unique character and she simply nails it. Almost exactly the same could be said for Ryan O'Neal. He equally is terrific in his role as straight laced Harvard jock Oliver Barrett. They are two very different characters which is really the entire point of this passionate romance. Their chemistry is unmistakable but the beauty of the romance is that its real. It doesn't feel all based on lust or passion but a real romance unfolds between them throughout their life. John Marley and Ray Milland are decent in supporting roles as MacGraw's and O'Neal's fathers respectively. They don't have big parts but they are vital to the story and do well in their roles.The key to Love Story is the phrase I keep saying, in its time. I don't know if that means that the film didn't age well but I think it is was far more important for when it was released. It was the end of the sixties, O'Neal and MacGraw were playing young lovers looking to find their way in the world like so many baby boomers. The simplistic and yet vibrant setting of the Harvard campus and Massachusetts is the perfect spot for their budding romance. The film feels incredibly short for the time span that it covers. We are to feel like this is an epic all time romantic love and yet they meet, they banter back and forth, they kiss, they make love, they marry, they work, they go to school...and then the ending. It all happens very quickly. The dialogue between them is terrific and of course the film features that classic line love means never having to say you're sorry. It was great to see the movie, but I just didn't get the classic vibe that its known for. It is mildly entertaining and fun to watch but I think it lost its effectiveness over the decades. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 February 2013","score":"","review":" Love Story is easily the forefather of all the romantic films after it.

So much anime acts thoughtful and deep, but ends up being fairly shallow and simple (see Neon Genesis and Death Note). Miyazaki has always been a person I could turn to for anime that is both fun AND thought-provoking. Please understand that I am as surprised as you are when I say that I really didn't like this movie.Now, I don't hate Mononoke. I enjoyed the spectacle, and I recognize that it is very well-made. The story is competently told and the setting is interesting.My problem is with the characters. No one in Mononoke acts like a human being. The prince is a perfect angel who isn't affected by human emotions like fear and greed. He is utterly flawless and boring. I mean sure, he's been cursed, but it doesn't really seem to do much to him. In fact, it only appears to make him stronger. What's he complaining about?The women of Irontown are the most hateful people I could possibly imagine. After the attack, one of them joked, If you hadn't been there, we'd all have to find ourselves new husbands. That's really funny, except to all of the women whose husbands are actually DEAD. What sort of callous, spiteful monster would say something like that? And worse, who would laugh at such an inappropriate joke? That same lady's husband was pushed off a cliff, almost died, and struggled for days to return home to his wife. When he finally makes it back home, what does she do? He calls him a dumbass and berates him in front of everyone. I wish the wolves had eaten you! Then maybe I could've found a real husband. What a heartless bitch! There is no sense of love or camaraderie from anyone. I don't believe that these two have ever actually loved each other.I could understand this if the animals were portrayed sympathetically. They are not. All of the animals are rather dickish about eating and destroying everything in their path. The people of Irontown are only trying to defend themselves and they are made out to be the villains. Sure, they're destroying the forest, but it doesn't appear like the rest of the world is all that bad; just this place.In fact, the only person in the movie who I actually liked was Lady Obashi, the evil gun-toting power-hungry psychopath. Sure, she wanted to rule the world, but she felt like a human being. She was kind to the lepers, took pity on the whores and gave them all new and rewarding jobs. She loved her people and wanted to protect them. But she's supposed to be the villain? I don't buy it.And what about the pig? I understand that the first pig turned into a demon because he was filled with rage, but what about the old pig? The last thing he felt was hope that all of his warriors were still alive. Why did he become a demon when he wasn't full of hate? For that matter, all of the other animals WERE full of hate. All of the wolves, the monkeys, and most of the pigs were hateful, vengeful bastards. Why didn't they turn into demons? It doesn't make any sense.Perhaps the depth of this movie has been lost on me. Perhaps Miyazaki is trying to say that war can make a monster out of anyone, no matter how noble his cause.

The quartet also rents Steve Guttenberg's boat and they bring up some large size boulder type rocks which they place in the pool.Our senior citizens keep going into the pool even with the rocks there and pretty soon they're noticing some marvelous changes, in Hume Cronyn, the most marvelous of all as his cancer goes into a complete remission, mystifying his doctors. That leads our group now joined by wives Jessica Tandy and Maureen Stapleton for Cronyn and Brimley and companion Gwen Verdon for Ameche that these are some special people.Special they are, humans they're not as the quartet shows them they're aliens in human body suits. And after some heartache and tragedy for both earth people and aliens, the aliens offer these old folks a chance never given to any humans before. For that you see Cocoon for.This is the kind of film that you can watch over and over and still feel good about yourselves and feel good that there are others out there in the vast universe who've played the game of life and have mastered the rules. There are so many other science fiction films that show monsters and other worldly creatures coming to earth with the most malicious of intentions. Cocoon is such a refreshing change.Cocoon got two Oscars in 1985 for special effects and a Best Supporting Actor Award for Don Ameche. In a sense it was wrong to single out Ameche because all the senior citizen players cut some fine characters that you'll remember and enjoy. But Ameche was always a class act in Hollywood, a person you'll not hear an unkind word about written or spoken by his contemporaries in a career that lasted from the Thirties to the Nineties. It was an award for a lifetime more than anything else.One of those characters also was Jack Gilford. There's a famous classic Twilight Zone episode which also takes place in a senior citizen home where the residents there are given the same chance as these people are. With a lot less attention I might add. Gilford fulfills the same function as Russell Collins did in The Twilight Zone, the one who stays behind because he can't bring himself to take the step necessary.Who knows how long or if humankind will approach what these aliens have, but in many ways Cocoon offers a peak into an existence more fabulous than ever portrayed on film before.

In fact, it doesn't deal in much horror as we commonly understand the genre. However weary people may be of the phrase psychological thriller, that's really the best way to describe this film. For the most part, the characters are older men, there are no on screen female characters, there's no sex, and gore is minimal. The main group of men are a professional asbestos removal team who bid for, and win, the gig to work on one of those creepy old abandoned insane asylums that we're always seeing in movies. While co-writer \/ director Brad Anderson (who scripted this with co-star Stephen Gevedon, who plays Mike) definitely sets about to milk the setting for as much atmosphere as it can deliver, what he stresses the most are characters, and their relationships with each other. These guys don't get along too well to begin with, and things only get worse as the job progresses. It's as if the place is influencing their minds. To add to our unease, Mike finds some tapes on which a psychiatrist has recorded various sessions with a patient named Mary, who has split personality disorder. What could possibly happen when he gets to the tape made of Session 9, when Simon, one of her personalities, finally emerges? The viewer will have an interesting time waiting for the answer, while feeling the tension build in a subtle but inexorable way. The acting is top notch, especially from Peter Mullan as Gordon; David Caruso may find himself the target of a lot of jokes because of 'C.S.I. Miami', but he shows here that he really is a capable actor when not locked into mannerisms. Josh Lucas is a hoot as trouble making Hank, and genre fans will be amused by the brief appearance of Larry Fessenden, himself an actor (I Sell the Dead) and filmmaker (Wendigo). Overall, as slow burn horror goes, this is very good. It's exceptionally well shot on 24P HD video (by Uta Briesewitz) and the use of the actual Danvers State Hospital is impeccable. Genre fans who demand lots of action and gore in what they watch may find themselves underwhelmed, but if you're looking for something much more based on performance and ambiance, it admirably fills the bill.

A few things struck me seeing this film again First, this movie still delivers suspense after all these years. The aptly titled Speed is as much about keeping you on an adrenaline rush as it is about passengers on a bomb rigged bus that will explode if the bus goes below 50 mph. The film begins with psychopath Dennis Hopper (Howard Payne) rigging an elevator full of passengers in an attempt to extort millions of dollars from the city. His plans go awry after meeting Jack Traven (Keeanu Reeves). This incident sparks a spectacular revenge plot that involves each man trying to outwit the other.Second, there are very few movies that create the chemistry between characters that this movie does. I'm not just talking about the obvious sizzle between Annie (Sandra Bullock) and Jack which manages to be created without any nudity or steamy sex scenes &#x96; go figure. You also have strong chemistry with the friendship between Jack and his detective partner Harry (played by Jeff Daniels) and even the respect and concern shown between Jack and his boss, the under-rated Joe Morton as Capt Mcmahon.Third, the writing and acting is formidable. This movie has equal parts action\/drama and witty humor. You'll want to reference many witty lines after watching this film from Annie's confession that her license has been revoked for speeding to the back and forth dialogue between the exasperated bus passengers (Gargantuan, I'm thinking of you!). I think most of us agree that Keeanu is never going to be on a list for greatest actors but he is credible as the bad ass cop with good looks and great biceps! Sandra plays a spunky Annie quite well. Dennis is perfectly cast as the bitter maniac bomb genius and all the other characters including those with minimal lines seem to make a lasting impression.This film is definitely worth watching or re-watching!
