It definitely seems to be directed by males insofar as the sex scenes go (the female body is both fetishist and problematized as a threat to men throughout the film too, but that's a different subject altogether), but these are more artsy than Skinemax night flicks in that there is very little nudity, it was tastefully shown for the most part and a lot was told with sounds and shadows. (Personally, I think the lesbians were there for shock since a male lover would have worked just as well, but in general I think some more subtlety could have been used in the sex scenes myself since imagining it is sexier IMHO).That said, the first half, which establishes character, does seem to drag quite a bit, but once the caper gets going it never stops.

Stoker's language is thoroughly Victorian but much better than that of a Henry James. But he does have the knack for building up the atmosphere for terror and horror. He is a master of that, not just in this classic but in short stories such as The Squaw and Judge's House. I will not be surprised if there is universal consensus that the book made a lasting impression on all those who read it. My first Dracula film was also around that time. It was the Lee\/ Cushing classic 'Horror of Dracula' on one of the many re-run tours. That was an effectively terrifying film which can deprive a young lad of sleep for many nights, when just a rustling curtain on a moonless night makes you pee. The story was not exactly faithful to Stoker but the broad outline conformed. Most people know the story or would have read a synopsis elsewhere, so I will not get into that. It is not easy to translate that horror to screen, and to avoid getting cheap like the Elm Street folks. Sequels followed and several other versions appeared with different actors, but none came to close this one (Salem's Lot was a reasonably good rendition of the book but commercially available tapes and DVDs are severely edited).Then in 1992 Coppola made his 'Dracula'. Coppola's Dracula had the best visuals. I think no one can surpass this master film-maker for the sets of the castle, the use of visual signals, the final chase and so many other things. Take the scene where the masked horseman picks up Harker at the pass. That was one great scene. And then, when Harker enters the castle for the first time. Nice touches like the Count's letter signed 'D' (people don't write like that anymore, do they?), the doomed schooner, I can go on. All these make this film visually an intensely satisfying experience, at least for fans of classic horror like me. When I think of the ill-conceived and inconsistent story lines, and bad direction of recent films like Sixth Sense and The Others (let alone your teenager slasher films), I think this film stands out. To repeat, visually, this is the best Dracula ever made.Do I have any reservations about this movie? A big one, and posing as an influential critic for a moment, I will cut one full star, hold that, a star and a half, from five stars for that big reservation. Coppola, paying homage to the touchy-feely, post-modern and politically correct early 1990s, wants us to 'understand' Dracula. He humanizes the fellow. And that robs Dracula of his character; his entire character, and leaves the story an insipid, tame one. It is all the more disappointing because the opening sequences are so good that you hope to see more. I do not think I am giving away anything (I hope not).According to Coppola, Prince Vlad (Stoker based his Dracula on this ruthless Slavic prince) is a regular sort of chap. He is a defender of Christianity against the advancing Ottoman Turks. Some Turkish chicanery leads to his wife committing suicide (to be reincarnated as Minna in an English Household). Vlad (not yet 'Dracul' the 'vampyr') returns home and mourns. In his anger, he loses faith and desecrates the church; and of course, because of that becomes the undead. About two to three hundred years later, he realizes that his darling is growing up as Minna in London. He wants to be reunited. So the ruse for buying a house in London. He has no plans for a British green card or work permit. He just wants to get her and come back home to Transylvania. If he has to bite a few lasses on the way for sustenance, so be it. He is really not a bad guy you know!This is the cheesiest part of the movie's script, and it really damages an otherwise excellent film. Vlad was only an outline for Dracula. The character of Dracula derives from unmitigating evil. As Stoker tells us, he practised the arts of necromancy during his 'life', and was condemned to be the undead for all his deeds. The undead have no feelings of mercy. They only have feelings of pleasure and survival. Both derive from from eternal existence and blood sucking. It is hinted in the book that the Count has three consorts for sensual pleasures too. Until Harker gets rid of them! The Count wants to move to London because the locals in Transylvania are getting hostile, and London is a naively scientific place where he can go about unfettered and undiscovered. The Count goes after Minna in particular for revenge and for a replacement companion. Not because he always wanted her. That is the essence of Dracula. He is condemned to be the eternal undead until someone decides to liberate his soul. Till then, he will spread his evil because that is the only thing he knows, can think of and does. That is the vampire for you!Unfortunately, all this is lost in Coppola. I think he could have made an even better film without the cheesy concession to the post-modernists. Teenybop Romance has no place in a serious work like this. That said, casting is pretty good in this film. Gary Oldman is very good as the older Dracula. I am not so sure about his Slavic look with those dreadlocks. Keanu Reeves never looks reassuring to anyone, and he fits the role of the whining Harker very well. Anthony Hopkins does a good job as Van Helsing.All in all, I would recommend you watch this movie with minimal lighting and no interruptions. It is a decent movie.

","genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Romance"},{"date":"23 November 2004","score":"14 out of 18 people found the following review useful","review":" The title summarizes it well. Despite what the nay-sayers would have you believe, don't take their word for it. Predator 2 is every bit as wonderful as its great predecessor. I'm very surprised that people think that P1 was better than P2. Why? Because of the dialogue where Arnie goes 'We're not assassins, we're rescuers only' and people believing that BS? Please! My verdict &#150; Both Predator films are outstanding. It's just too bad that idiot Paul Anderson was the one who was in charge of directing the pathetic attempt at a 3rd movie. But then again, this isn't the place to discuss the trauma that was Alien Vs Predator. The action in P2 starts fast and furious from the very beginning. The characters are emotionally charged, with Danny Glover, Bill Paxton, Maria Alonso all giving good performances, with smaller characters, such as their captain and the police chief above him, still being decent characters who are played respectfully well by their actors. I suppose audiences nowadays want to see more of the stereotypical politician\/idiot of a police captain and chief, and maybe they couldn't handle seeing a police chief who had justifiable gripes with his officer's behavior. At least that's my theory. ******MINOR SPOILER******* Gary Busey leads the other half of the cast, those being the federal agents who are out to freeze the predator and steal its technology. This is definitely Busey's best performance next to Lethal Weapon 1. His character's a hard@$$ who doesn't have the desire to talk to anyone who isn't within his tight-knit agency, so much so that it's obvious he's going through major pains when he finally cracks and tells Glover's character all he knows. Must've been hard for him. And oddly enough, Busy and Glover make a decent team, even if it was one that resembled two magnets that naturally act against each other. We find out a bit more about the predator's background. His ship was nice, ditto for his array of new weapons, and the ending where we see that predators had been on earth for centuries was cool. So they CAN speak English, hehehe ******END SPOILER******* And the bit where Glover's character greets Morton Downey Jr's as the latter is bugging him for comments after yet another series of murders? Beautiful -D My first minor gripe about this film is that there are a few too many expendables who show up simply to be chopped up by the predator. While the first movie had a small number of characters, so that every death was noticed and counted, the second one has literally dozens of cops, federal agents, drug dealers and civilians who encounter and are killed by the monster. That created some amount of de-sensitivity to the violence, which is bad, although the predator's victims are never forgotten by Glover's character as he relentlessly goes after the monster, which is good. My second gripe is that the villainous drug dealers are all one-dimensional, as there's nothing more to them than standard run-of-the-mill bad guys who kill with no regard for the sanctity of human life. It would've been nice if we had at least one drug dealer who had a positive side to him, just like the police officers' and federal agents' negative sides that were so superbly put on film. But then again, that's a problem that the first movie suffered from also &#150; showing 'terrorists' who kill for no reason, and who only exist to be exterminated by Arnie and Company's righteous soldiers.I suppose the reason for that is because the audience wants simplicity and the freedom to place people within Good and Evil labels, and doesn't want complicated social explanations that can turn a good person into a bad one. If only it was easy enough for me to say that it's just a movie and it shouldn't be taken more seriously than that, but it's not, as this is the image of 'evil drug dealers' and 'evil terrorists' that the ignorant masses see that makes it so easy for slimeball politicians to manipulate public opinion.

And the predator is running amok in the middle of it all. That makes this a great film. Just remember to keep in mind why Danny Glover's character is so outraged at the predator's killing of humans, because human life is supposed to be precious, and it's easy to forget that when so many characters in this film act otherwise.

Despite what the nay-sayers would have you believe, don't take their word for it. Predator 2 is every bit as wonderful as its great predecessor.

My verdict &#150; Both Predator films are outstanding. It's just too bad that idiot Paul Anderson was the one who was in charge of directing the pathetic attempt at a 3rd movie. But then again, this isn't the place to discuss the trauma that was Alien Vs Predator. The action in P2 starts fast and furious from the very beginning. The characters are emotionally charged, with Danny Glover, Bill Paxton, Maria Alonso all giving good performances, with smaller characters, such as their captain and the police chief above him, still being decent characters who are played respectfully well by their actors. I suppose audiences nowadays want to see more of the stereotypical politician\/idiot of a police captain and chief, and maybe they couldn't handle seeing a police chief who had justifiable gripes with his officer's behavior. At least that's my theory. ******MINOR SPOILER******* Gary Busey leads the other half of the cast, those being the federal agents who are out to freeze the predator and steal its technology. This is definitely Busey's best performance next to Lethal Weapon 1. His character's a hard@$$ who doesn't have the desire to talk to anyone who isn't within his tight-knit agency, so much so that it's obvious he's going through major pains when he finally cracks and tells Glover's character all he knows. Must've been hard for him. And oddly enough, Busy and Glover make a decent team, even if it was one that resembled two magnets that naturally act against each other. We find out a bit more about the predator's background. His ship was nice, ditto for his array of new weapons, and the ending where we see that predators had been on earth for centuries was cool. So they CAN speak English, hehehe ******END SPOILER******* And the bit where Glover's character greets Morton Downey Jr's as the latter is bugging him for comments after yet another series of murders? Beautiful -D My first minor gripe about this film is that there are a few too many expendables who show up simply to be chopped up by the predator. While the first movie had a small number of characters, so that every death was noticed and counted, the second one has literally dozens of cops, federal agents, drug dealers and civilians who encounter and are killed by the monster. That created some amount of de-sensitivity to the violence, which is bad, although the predator's victims are never forgotten by Glover's character as he relentlessly goes after the monster, which is good. My second gripe is that the villainous drug dealers are all one-dimensional, as there's nothing more to them than standard run-of-the-mill bad guys who kill with no regard for the sanctity of human life. It would've been nice if we had at least one drug dealer who had a positive side to him, just like the police officers' and federal agents' negative sides that were so superbly put on film. But then again, that's a problem that the first movie suffered from also &#150; showing 'terrorists' who kill for no reason, and who only exist to be exterminated by Arnie and Company's righteous soldiers.I suppose the reason for that is because the audience wants simplicity and the freedom to place people within Good and Evil labels, and doesn't want complicated social explanations that can turn a good person into a bad one.

Most critics and audiences were disappointed by the film, expecting another one of QT's bloodbath exercises.I can't understand how a clever, empty style-fest like Pulp Fiction could've been praised as a masterpiece while others are actually disappointed to see that Tarantino has decided to slow down and focus on his characters. Here we have the same play on old 70's gangster clichés as in Pulp and Reservoir Dogs. However, it is done with depth (which critics didn't notice), flow (which bored critics), and refinement (which really made critics mad). I'm sad to say that those who are expecting Pam Grier to whip out a shotgun and preach the Bible will be disappointed. Here we have a story about what happens to gangsters in their old age, when they get worn out by an intense profession. That's not all it is about; each character in the ensemble has his own story. Grier, as Jackie Brown, is scared about the future, with a lousy job as an airline stewardess and a drug charge hanging over her head; she is also getting old and fears that her 'foxy brown' image might be wearing thin. Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson) is a gun dealer who wants to retire, but is such a megalomaniac that few of his friends actually trust him; the odds of him ever being able to comfortably settle down are slim to none. He is also concerned about his partner, Louis (Robert De Niro), who just got out of the joint and seems to have lost the street-smarts (and even the regular smarts) that he had before he went away. Bridget Fonda is Melanie, Ordell's mistress of sorts, whose life has slowed down; she spends her time doing drugs, watching TV, and scheming against Ordell. Max Cherry (Robert Forster) is a by-the-book bail bondsman who is fifty-six years old and is thinking about getting into a scheme with Jackie. The only main character without too much depth is Ray Nicolette (played by Michael Keaton, who plays the same character in Steven Soderbergh's dazzling Out of Sight); Michael Keaton plays him memorably though. Grier gives a triumphantly good performance, blending her 70's funky (albeit tacky) style and wonderful charisma with great classic melodrama. Robert Forster is just as good in a subtler and more poignant performance; what is most likable about his character is that the two main reasons he starts thinking about scheming against Ordell with Jackie is that (a.) he loves her and (b.) he wants to get his young genre-cool back. Samuel L. Jackson drops his flashiness-for-the-sake-of-flashiness from Pulp Fiction and plays a sad, lonely man in a world filled with friends who hate his guts. He wants to trick everyone into thinking that he is Jules, from Pulp, and tries to justify his life in front of others. But, in the end, he is a toothless rat, threatening others in a feeble and desperate tone of voice. De Niro and Fonda are both funny in a relationship that turns for the worse and ends in a way that reminds us how fickle a life the crook can lead, one where relationships can shift on the whim of one's viscera. Spike Lee and others were infuriated by Tarantino's constant use of the n-word in the film, mostly by Samuel L. Jackson. This criticism misses the point of what QT is trying to do degrade the n-word. The characters use it, and re-use, until it is drained of its terrible power. It is the kind of wonderful liberation that a nihilist like Spike Lee could never understand. Based on Rum Punch by Elmore Leonard, Jackie Brown is packed with twists and with characters discussing their next betrayal to the extent that we are never sure who is being lied to. But each twist means something to each character, which makes the film great. Tarantino is famous for his dialogue, yet his dialogue is not the kind of clever crook-talk that someone like David Mamet delivers; it is funny without the characters knowing that it is funny (the kind of funny that Elmore Leonard has always loved). Tarantino is really an old-fashioned gangster filmmaker, like Raoul Walsh, who doesn't rely on clever lines as much as casual cheer (such as the scene in Walsh's The Roaring Twenties in which James Cagney stuffs a cigar in someone's mouth). He has a love for cynical movies in a humanistic and joyful way that makes him rise above the filmmakers he loves. He cares about every character in Jackie Brown and is sad when one gets killed.

I felt like with the success of Titanic, that Bay was trying to re-manipulate the idea of incorporating a teeny bopper love story into a major disaster in history. Although, Cameron did a hell of a lot better job in Titanic.Affleck is a great actor who always gets typecasts. He's always put in the wrong roles and this certainly is not helping him out. Josh Hartnett is also an underrated actor, but he is just so freakin' sloppy in this movie.The attack scene on Pearl harbor, the 45 minutes of the movie that actually make the movie title somewhat make sense (I think they should have stuck with the original title, Tennasse or whatever) is one of the most poorly filmed war scenes I have ever seen. Smudging lenses to cover up blood to make sure of a PG-13 rating. It's just hack film making that Michael Bay is making so popular these days.The bombing raids in the end, the crashing in china, this to me doesn't seem like Pearl Habor. To me, this is history slapped together into one giant mess only to confuse teenagers more on history events. Worrying more about ticket sales rather than art and actually somewhat educating people. I remember my ex-girlfriend, God bless her mind, actually thought Pearl harbor was a war in Alaska with the French...yeah, anyway, enough said on that.If you want to see a film about Pearl Harbor that is much better.

Let me explain myself the best way to describe this movie is a combination of Jaws and Titanic with too many Christian influences. It's already bad enough that the director can't come up with an original movie, but why does he have to be so moralizing in it as well?The story is about scientists who may have found a cure for Alzheimer decease in the brain of sharks. But the scientists needed more brain tissue so they genetically manipulated the sharks so their brains would grow a lot larger. But the sharks use their extra brain capacity in their own advantage, becoming fearsome hunters who have developed the taste for human flesh...I guess you already know where the link between Deep Blue Sea and Jaws can be found. The sharks are at least as big as Jaws. They attack humans and can't be stopped by any means, not even steel doors or fences... But where do I get the link with Titanic? Well, for instance the flooded corridors and the water that flows in with incredible power really looked like Titanic's scenes to me. The same for the structure that eventually will go down into the deep (OK, it isn't a boat but it sure comes close).But the biggest problem with this movie is that it's so moralizing. For instance One of the man on the project has spent two years in jail. The leader of the project doesn't trust him, but uses him as a shark wrangler (no harm done when he gets eaten alive, right?). But of course when the trouble starts he appears to be a very nice man who will do everything to help the others. The same for the cook. You just know from the beginning that he'll survive this. He's a black preacher, he once lost faith in God but is now very religious again. All I missed was a hymn like I once was lost, but now am found or something like that in the background. All the movie tries to say with this is that you should never judge a person on his past and that as long as you believe in God the devil (here in the person of sharks) can't harm you.

The Usual Suspects is a classic example of a film in which the final five minutes negate the entire rest of the feature. Young Guns II, on the other hand, negates itself right in the opening sequence. Of course, the teenage girl market that it was aimed at wouldn't notice at first, but once one does a little research into who Billy The Kid was, holes start appearing faster than adolescent females used to appear at Emilio Estevez films in the early to mid 1980s.In the 1950s, a man by the name of Brushy Bill Roberts (who had already tried to claim he was once a member of Jesse James' gang) contracted a lawyer and went before Governor Thomas Mabry. The film claims in its closing credits that Roberts was discredited in spite of identification by surviving friends of the notorious outlaw. In reality, the only people with any real connection to Billy The Kid in attendance were sons of Pat Garrett, Kip McKinney and William Brady. Oscar Garrett, when asked if he had any questions to ask of Roberts, simply stated that he did not wish to dignify the claim. Which is understandable when you compare Roberts' story with the facts. Or a photo of Roberts to the singular known authentic photo of Billy The Kid.There is, in fact, a site at www.aboutbillythekid.com, which I recommend to all those who want to know the truth of the Kid's life story. One page there documents the Brushy Bill case a lot more thoroughly than the writers of this film obviously did.

There is a quote about Garrett that sums it up You know what they say about Pat Garrett. He killed men like he killed buffalos, but at least he didn't ambush the animals in the dark. Garrett was also very much a nobody before he shot Billy The Kid, unlike what is shown here.In essence, this is not even an inaccurate retelling of someone's life. This is an attempt to cash in on someone else's inaccurate retelling of a life they never led. What Young Guns II does have going for it is some of the best Western gunfights outside a Sergio Leone film, sumptuous cinematography from one of the few people whose name deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Leone, a scenery-chewing performance from Emilio Estevez, and an equally scenery-chewing performance from Christian Slater.

We've read The Catcher in the Rye, Antigone, Fences, and The Death of a Salesmen. So we watched Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. First of all, the movie had excellent acting. I adored Elizabeth Taylor's portrayal of the love-seeking woman who rides a constant emotional roller-coaster. Paul Newman was also absolutely amazing. I will never forget the scene in which Maggie grasps on to Brick, and he almost embraces her, but then shakes her away. Then he goes into the bathroom alone and buries his face into her slip that's hanging on the door. It's so haunting, and it shows something deeper in Brick. The other actors were absolutely wonderful as well. Secondly, the symbolism in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof are incredible. The thing I noticed within the first few minutes of the movie was how the relationship between Big Daddy and Big Momma mirrored the relationship between Brick and Maggie. Also, I loved the use of the weather in the telling of the story. It starts raining, and then it starts storming when the conflict between the characters really starts to roar. When Brick leads Big Daddy up the stairs, they see that it has stopped raining. Their arguments were like a storm. Also, another storm was going on in the parlor with Big Momma, Maggie, Gooper, and Mae. The breaking of Brick's crutch was major symbolism. Alcohol and his story about Skipper had always been his crutch. At the moment he saw who he really was, his crutch was broken. The ending of the movie was very touching. Mae getting what she deserved was so very gratifying. I had kind of hoped that Maggie would have hit her or something, but Mae was given what would bother her the most. She saw Maggie and Brick receive respect, something that she had waived in front of them for the whole movie. The final scene in the bedroom was so simple, yet so thorough. I loved how when Maggie and Brick were embracing, Brick reaches for his pillow from the sofa and tosses it onto the bed. Such a wonderful movie.

The thing I noticed within the first few minutes of the movie was how the relationship between Big Daddy and Big Momma mirrored the relationship between Brick and Maggie. Also, I loved the use of the weather in the telling of the story. It starts raining, and then it starts storming when the conflict between the characters really starts to roar. When Brick leads Big Daddy up the stairs, they see that it has stopped raining. Their arguments were like a storm. Also, another storm was going on in the parlor with Big Momma, Maggie, Gooper, and Mae. The breaking of Brick's crutch was major symbolism. Alcohol and his story about Skipper had always been his crutch. At the moment he saw who he really was, his crutch was broken. The ending of the movie was very touching. Mae getting what she deserved was so very gratifying. I had kind of hoped that Maggie would have hit her or something, but Mae was given what would bother her the most. She saw Maggie and Brick receive respect, something that she had waived in front of them for the whole movie. The final scene in the bedroom was so simple, yet so thorough. I loved how when Maggie and Brick were embracing, Brick reaches for his pillow from the sofa and tosses it onto the bed. Such a wonderful movie. It will undoubtedly become one of my all-time favorites!

Wells's The Food of the Gods, director\/producer\/writer Bert I. Gordon, Mr BIG himself, brings us a tale about a roving gang of teen thugs(nothing like today' s variation)who walk to a small town surrounded by a mudslide. In that town, a young genius, creatively named Genius works on varying experiments. One of these experiments when fed to a living thing causes the living thing to grow to tremendous proportions. We first see ducks, then a dog, and finally a tarantula. The gang takes the food of the Gods and gets big...and you can figure what happens for the most part after that. Highly unimaginative and lewd, Village of the Giants is really more concerned with showing beautiful scantily clad girls in tight polyester slacks and bikini tops grow to epic proportions. We see them literally bust out of their garments. They wear toga-like outfits, dance sensuously, bend over as much as possible to give the greatest vantage point to their cleavage, and so on. One giant girl even picks a small man up and has him hang from her top while she dances. The girls are all babes. Joy Harmon is stunning as is Tisha Sterling. But my gripe is...what's the point of presenting this as science fiction if all you really want to do is make this type of film? The acting ranges from OK(Ronny Howard is better than everyone else!), less than adequate(most of the gang including its leader Beau Bridges), to just bad(Tommy Kirk). Typical Bert Gordon special effects are here too. As mentioned by many other viewers, the music is really the best thing about the movie - well, next to Joy Harmon and Tisha Sterling and the other gang girls!
