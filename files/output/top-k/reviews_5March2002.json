It even borrowed from final fantasy where the ziggarut,tower of babil, was built to attain more power, amazing. Much better than the sailer moon type movie i was expecting. The ending is to die for)  ","genre":null},{"date":"5 March 2002","score":"","review":"  Great!Best animation ive seen and im a big fan of Don Bluth so thats hard to say.I liked it better than Ghost in the shell and Akira and cared more for the characters, plot even made more sense.So much was borrowed from other movies that it was hard to keep track but stayed original in the characters( duke red and Fifi for one)The characters resembled a 1930s or 40s black and white cartoon, (I forget the name of it, it showed a futuristic movie theatre).
