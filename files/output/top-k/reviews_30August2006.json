While this was undoubtedly an act of nepotism, it started the modernization of the Studio and just as the sound films was becoming the norm rather than the rule, Laemmle Jr. began the production of a horror film based on one of the most important horror novels of all times Bram Stoker's Dracula. Directed by Tod Browning, Dracula would be the beginning of the Universal Horror era, and the film that would make Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi an immortal icon of the genre.While the film was the first official Dracula in film (F. W. Murnau was unable to obtain the rights to the story for his 1922 silent horror Nosferatu, Eine Symphonie Des Grauens), several financial problems and the Great Depression truncated Laemmle's dreams of making a faithful adaptation, so writer Garret Fort adapted the Dracula play written by Hamilton Deane and John L. Balderston, which already had been a success in Broadway. The play was less faithful to the novel, but the core story was still there, Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi) is an ancient Transylvanian vampire who, aided by his new servant Renfield (Dwight Frye), moves to London looking for young blood. There he'll meet Prof. Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan), a man of science who is decided to stop Dracula.An experienced director of silent films, Tod Browning was already known for his taste for macabre and irreverent stories. Along with actor Lon Chaney he had directed horror classics like London After Midnight, The Unknown and The Unholy Three so the genre was not new to him. Dracula shows Browning going for a more mature and serious Gothic horror (it's for the most part void of comedy), showing a Count Dracula that is at the same time charming and terrifying. Just like his Count, the imagery he crafts is beautifully haunting, with the static shots and the lack of musical score enhancing this unnatural feeling of being stuck in time, pretty much like vampires do.Personally, the adaptation of the play version is not a favorite of mine (as it omits interesting supporting characters and situations), but considering the film's budget and the time the film was done it's quite fitting. The main problem I saw was that other than Van Sloan's Van Helsing, the heroes are very weak, and underdeveloped, with John Harker (David Manners) being the most damaged character. Still, the plot is quite well written and the essence of Dracula is still there.Three actors in this film have become legendary, and not without a reason, as Lugosi, Van Sloan and Frye completely own the film. Bela Lugosi is fantastic in the role that would become his own personal curse, portraying the Count with the dignity required for an ancient nobleman and the savage sex appeal of a vampire predator. Van Sloan is equally effective, as the scientist that represents the good values and moral of Victorian society. Finally, Dwight Frye gives the best performance of the film as the deranged Renfield, easily stealing every scene he is in. The rest of the cast is a mixed bag, ranging from OK to bad, although a lot of it can be blamed on the script that focuses entirely in Dracula's fight against Van Helsing.Tod Browning's Dracula is a classic without a doubt, but it's far from flawless. The static look of the film at times feel too stagy, and Browning is definitely not entirely familiar with the sound era (he would overcome this in the superior Freaks). The poor acting of some members of the cast is another little flaw, although in the end Lugosi and Frye make up for it. Honestly, the big turn off is not exactly related to the film itself, the main problem is that nowadays there have been countless versions of Dracula that this one may look dated to modern fans of the genre.While not the first Dracula (Murnau's film can claim that title), this film opened the gates to a new era of horror, and brought it to a wider audience that finally accepted it. Flawed and maybe dated by now, Dracula still holds up a certain unnatural magic that lures audiences worldwide, surrendered to the Count's charm and willing to do his bid.
