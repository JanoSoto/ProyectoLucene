From third to first, it was Animal House and Grease (for the trivia, Superman was the second).And these two movies -regarded now as classic- worked because they didn't conflict one to another, each one carried its own spirit and did a damn good job at that. John Landis' Animal House was set in 1962 but was clearly impregnated by a touch of absurdity and a sense of anarchy, obviously too mature for the very time it depicted, like a raunchy and adult variation of something that was closer tone-wise to George Lucas' 1962 in American Graffiti. Granted the actors were all baby-boomers who lived the real 1962, but it was their 1978 selves acting there, no doubt.Things work in reverse for Grease, it's set only three years earlier, not a huge chronological leap, but it's an obvious over-the-top, fantasized version of the 50's, one that the cast knew as kids or pre-teens and could only re-enact with a tender nostalgia, which is what Grease is about. There's no way you can watch that We Go Together sequence at the end without feeling some magical sentiment invading your heart. The only proper description I can give (from a guy born four years after the film) is 'paradoxical nostalgia'. Basically, I feel like I lived at the film's time or the release's time, who said Cinema acted rationally anyway?And the reason, I, and I believe many fans who're from my generation, feel that way is because Grease plays the cards straightforwardly and doesn't pretend to be anything else than a good old-fashioned romance and a heart-grabbing musical. Does it sound too reducing? Maybe; but then again, how many romances fail? How many musicals were swept-off by the passing of time? It's not easy, and sometimes, you need two strong protagonists to make it work. In the case of Grease, directed by Randal Kleiser (because the director deserves some credit) and I apologize in advance to Olivia Newton-John's fans, I think the film works primarily thanks to John Travolta, who plays Danny Zuko, the cool and handsome T Birds leader.Indeed, if there's anything Grease did, is to have proved some skeptical minds that Travolta wasn't a one-hit wonder, the hit being his success in Saturday Night Fever, the cocky disco dancer staggering down New York was meant to 'stay alive'. He had the looks, the charisma and just as he knew how to be funny even in a dramatic way, in the case of Grease, he could be serious in a comedic way. Travolta's success wasn't accidental and although he had many ups and downs, he was an actor who could act and move his way out of a good story, so that his persona wouldn't desert the screens forever. Of course, everyone remembers the names of Olivia Newton-John who played Sandy, the sweet and innocent Australian girl falling in love with the bad-boy, macho man and cool greaser, in another take of Romeo and Juliet meets Beauty and the Beast myths, as we all remember Stockard Channing as the scene-stealing Pink Sisters' leader Rizzo and &#x85; you know, that actress who played Frenchy&#x85; it gets tougher, now. I know the rest of the cast includes many nice- looking guys and dolls, 2uko's friend, Kelk.. Kell&#x85; never mind, the torrid 'Cha-cha' (whom I just learned from Wikipedia that she passed away) but also a first-class list of supporting players who, by their sole presence, pay a genuine tribute to the old days  Sid Caesar, Joan Blondell, Frankie Avalon and Eve Arden, to name a few&#x85;But it's Travolta's movie nonetheless. And he might have half of Astaire's dancing talent or half of James Dean's iconic appeal, but both halves makes a 'one' that oddly surpasses these two legends. And it doesn't shine only during the romantic moments, because like I said, it took two things to make 'Grease work a romance and a musical, and I guess the streak of stinkers Travolta had during the 80's was because each time, something lacked. But even when your plot is predictable, all you need are catchy songs and memorable lyrics. Grease has more than needed, and there's never one moment you feel like skipping. From Summer Nights to Sandra Dee from the sweet Hopelessly Devoted to You to the defining You're the One that I Want and the final apotheosis of Go Together, every emotion is rewarded, and the fun is always there.Grease made it in both AFI's Romances and Musical List with Summer Nights in the Top 100 Songs (The One that I Want was unfairly overlooked). The film was the last musical to throne on the box-office and it is the most successful one in history, and almost forty years later, its appeal is undeniable. It might feel laughable in a sort of juvenile naivety whether the two friends pretending to act macho after a hug, the way one gets knocked down by a car door or the whole 'all's well that ends well' finale but it still works. And as I suspect most viewers in 1978 weren't high school kids in 1959; and thankfully, so they couldn't spot the exaggeration, we love the film now for its timeless quality and tender simplicity; one that made the success a series like Glee. That's the power of music, always carrying a personal resonance. Speaking of mine, I remembered spotting during the dance-off the choreography from that Spanish summer hit Asereje and using Zucco as my first nickname when I started chatting (good old Caramail days).

She said the opening sequence of nearly five minutes long with few editing breaks sets the stage for what is to come. She said this was how professional screenwriters dream about opening a movie. It's just... flawless. The opening reveals layer upon layer of story themes with very few words, just visuals and a few key noises in the background. Without a single actor in the midst.

Magnificence in direction.Watching it again last night made me realize how special of a movie it really was. I simply enjoyed the experience. It transported me back to 1985 all over again.

Two genius actors playing off one another, along with the perfect supporting cast, makes this a must-watch movie at any time in history. It is genuinely funny, sweet, nostalgic, witty, beautiful, and exciting. Every scene has something to do with another scene. There is literally not a single wasted frame in this movie. Later episodes of the series aren't as perfect as BTTF1 but that's a different story... If anyone ever creates a time-capsule, PLEASE make sure to include this movie.

That 1985 date also allows for a perfect anchor to bounce around in the future two sequels in the series.I remember watching this in the theater when it was first run in - yes, I was there - 1985. My best friend sitting next to me in the theater watched Michael J Fox stumble along 1955 Main Street and his comment at that moment in the movie was, Nobody could play this character better than Michael J Fox. I have to agree. MJF IS Marty McFly personified. He carries the picture effortlessly and heroically, along with the hilarious and severely underrated Christopher Lloyd as the genius\/basket case, Dr. Emmitt Brown. Two genius actors playing off one another, along with the perfect supporting cast, makes this a must-watch movie at any time in history. It is genuinely funny, sweet, nostalgic, witty, beautiful, and exciting. Every scene has something to do with another scene. There is literally not a single wasted frame in this movie. Later episodes of the series aren't as perfect as BTTF1 but that's a different story... If anyone ever creates a time-capsule, PLEASE make sure to include this movie. Future millennia of species will enjoy it too. -)If you haven't watched Back to the Future before, regardless of your age or generation, please reward yourself with this near-perfect time-travel comedy. I loved it even more this time around. I couldn't recommend it highly enough. 10 out of 10.

However I still managed to find the jokes quite refreshing and there are many quotable lines here. Just thinking about the best quotes in the movie bring a smile back to my face. The trio of directors and writers, Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker, often referred to as the ZAZ team, deliver a witty and highly quotable film. They went on to direct separate films as well and they each proved to be incredibly talented. Their greatest accomplishment was taking serious actors and trusting in them to deliver dead pan humor. No one did this better than Liam Neeson who reinvented his career after this and is now remembered by everyone for his spoof films. He was a perfect fit for the material and no one could deliver the ZAZ's ridiculous lines better than he did. Airplane! is a spoof film of disaster movies that is so cleverly written and well directed that it's hard to believe that now more than 30 years later it is still leagues better than any modern spoof comedy. The film didn't have to worry about being politically correct and there were many jokes that no studio would dare to put into their films now. Ted Striker (Robert Hays) is an ex-Air Force pilot who has been afraid of flying ever since he suffered a terrible accident. His girlfriend, Elaine (Julie Hagerty), has decided to end their relationship because he is not going anywhere in life. She breaks the news to him right before boarding a flight as part of the crew. Desperate to win her back, Ted faces his fears and decides to get on board the flight as well. In mid air several of the passengers begin to feel ill from food poisoning, including the pilots, Captain Oveur (Peter Graves) and Murdock (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). Dr. Rumack (Liam Neeson) is in the flight as well so he is asked to treat the ill passengers. With no pilot remaining, Elaine asks Ted to save everyone on board. With the help of McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges) giving instructions from the control room, Ted will have to confront his fears in order to safely land the plane and save everyones lives.The film does take a while to take off as it slowly introduces some of the characters including the Ted and Elaine relationship. It's not until Neeson appears on screen that the comedy really hits on all cylinders. He has great chemistry with Bridges and Hays so getting to see the three of them deliver their serious dead pan humor was a treat. Abrahams went on to work with Bridges in the Hot Shots movies, which also ranks as one of the better examples of spoof films, while David Zucker had tremendous success working alongside Neeson in The Naked Gun franchise. Jerry Zucker didn't have the same success with comedies, but he directed the widely beloved romantic film, Ghost. So all three directors proved their worth after the huge success in Airplane! but they also have had success in their individual projects as well. However there is no doubt that their contribution for this film laid the groundworks for what was yet to come and hopefully modern spoof films can find inspiration once again from their work. The genre seems to be dead right now, but what a revival Airplane! was for the genre in the 80's and 90's. http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"3 August 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I take it black, like my men.It's a shame I never got to see this hilarious film sooner because Airplane! has been influencing comedies over the past 35 years now, and many spoof films have borrowed heavily from it.

It is a place where they show an audience the effects of brainwashing, on these Korean soldiers. Raymond Shaw(Laurence Harvey) is the key. They have effective turned him into an assassin. His fellow G.I.'s are there to witness the experiments. Shaw's trigger is though the game of Solitaire. Once he plays he is under complete control.

When the experiments starts Shaw is told to shot one of his fellow G.I.'s in the head; and he does.When Shaw comes home from Korea, he is viewed as a war hero; by the public; but it is all a cover. The only ones that know what he really is, is his operatives; even Major Marco is fooled. His operatives are his mother, Mrs Islin(Angela Landsbury) and his Father Senator Islin(James Gregory). They appear to be a power hungry couple who believe some Americans are Communists. Raymond hates his mother, because she has always been so controlling and mean.

When Marco( Sinatra) finds out what has happened to Shaw he tries to reverse his brainwashing hoping for positive results. Once Shaw is at the Stadium for the Presidential speech, it looks like Shaw is going to complete the mission. Instead he kills his operatives, his mother and father.

I gave it 1 star, but my review focuses on what Lucas (almost) did right. In my mind there are four franchises that transcend all the others James Bond, Indiana Jones, Star Trek, and Star Wars.Of these, Star Wars is the most difficult one to work with. It has numerous interconnected characters and story lines, and specific rules and events to work around. This is in stark contrast to Indiana Jones, Star Trek, and James Bond which are a series of independent stories. Few side characters are carried forward, and the overall objectives and enemies are every changing. Occasionally even the actors are replaced and nobody seems to mind. Even if you mess up the formula in these franchises and make a bad film, the fans forgive you and move on to the next one.Star Wars doesn't offer that kind of flexibility. It was also the first of the franchises to attempt a prequel, which compounded the problem. From the very beginning (Episode Four) backs stories were referenced. There was clearly a collection of exciting events that had taken place which viewers wanted to know more about. Lucas even teased us with it, making the eventual reveal of the truth all the more effective.But when it came to the prequels, Lucas took an existing problem and made it worse. With the viewers already knowing the eventual outcome, and existing characters involved, Lucas extended his obligations to include nearly the entire cast and plot lines from the original trilogy. Even characters like Chewy, C3PO, R2D2, and Boba Fett, were needlessly included.Lucas mistakes in the prequels were many, but his excessive plot commitments to the old trilogy, made them uncorrectable going forward. He boxed himself into a corner with a story line that was both predictable and over-complicated for the next two films.Personally, I never really liked the decision to anchor everything around Darth Vader. He'd already made too many modifications to that character as it was. Many great movies are anchored around mysterious villains. But that mystery gives the villain their power. Vader was at his most powerful in the opening scene of New Hope. We didn't know who he was, what he was, or what he wanted, but he scared the crap out of us. He clearly could not be messed with, and had powers that we had only begun to imagine. He was the Empire's bogey man. By the final scene of Jedi, Vader was a vulnerable and human character. He'd been robbed of all his emotional power, but it didn't really matter because the story was complete. With the prequels, Lucas is trying to turn back time on that entire transformation. He wants to make Anakin lovable and endearing, and then freighting again. Even if such a re-transformation were possible, it was executed so poorly the audience was laughing by the end. Vader is a winy lunatic now, neither loved nor feared. It was a mistake and I don't think any writer could have corrected it.But giving Lucas the benefit of the doubt in crafting the prequels as The Anakin Trilogy...let's look at the four things he (almost) did right.1. The forbidden\/doomed love aspect was very compelling...but it was absent from this first film. The fact that Padme was older than Anakin, and had no real connection to him from the start, made it all the more awkward when it was forced down our throats over the next two films. If anything, we leave the first film with Padme engaging in a motherly relationship with Anakin. How were supposed to come back from that? Lifeless dialogue and creepy moments aside, Lucas could have successfully rode this storyline to Anakin's downfall, but only he does so from the start.2. Darth Maul was fantastic...but dead. Sure it was a recycled character, but it worked. Darth Maul was the Darth Vader of this film. He was a mysterious and sinister villain that the audience actually connected with. In fact he was probably the most memorable new character from the prequels. The problem was he is killed off, and that connection dies with him. Things were setup for a powerful revenge subplot between Obi-Won and Maul which could have carried the next two films. It also presented Anakin with a future vision of himself, a chance to witness how powerful the dark side really was, but this avenue is never explored. Bottom line, Maul's death set in motion a perpetual cycle of villains to be introduced over the next films, with lesser effect. 3. The Young Obi-Won. Obi-Won Kenobi was a very stoic character in the original trilogy, but he always carried this smirk which seemed to say, son, if you only knew... The splash of color on Obi-Won's character and past was probably the biggest thing fans craved from the original trilogy. Lucas flirted with this, but never really went with it. Obi-Won is just a supporting character engaged in a variety of minor side-plots. He loses some friends, kills a few bad guys, but in the end we don't know much more about him than we did before. 4. Give Us The Evil Empire! The trailer was great because it completely packed with sinister looking characters, epic space battles, screams of tragedy...exactly what we always thought rise of the empire must have looked like. What Lucas actually delivered was a fake empire, a fake death star, and tragic death of one guy we just met. The rise of the empire should have been so much more. The fact that it all amounted to a few legislative votes, trade disputes, and military projects was the most uninspired approach Lucas could have come up with. And he still took three films to do it.

Its a true British Classic. The cast and writers are so clever, they pull of being stupid in a most believable way. I would compare to somebody like Les Dawson, another classic British entertainer who had such a gift on the piano he could deliberately play a song with the wrong notes.You watch this film, you feel satisfied entertainment wise and value for money wise. This film is leaps and bounds better than modern films like Scary Movie or Austin Powers.I can't say enough about how good the acting is in this film, every single one of the characters delivers an outstanding performance.

It has a similar style, setting and mostly the same cast from that film. With some filmmakers this could risk being repetitive and failing to live up to a previous success. But fortunately Ritchie seems to improve upon what he did in Lock, Stock in every way remaining loyal in style whilst creating a wholly original and hilarious comedy. Its narrative is similar to something like Pulp Fiction, since there's no single plot that the film follows. Instead it follows many insane characters as they navigate the world of London crime and watch as their stories collide in to each other (both literally and metaphorically) as they try to do every crime from rigging boxing matches to stealing a 86 carat diamond. And seeing these characters interactions is definitely the best part of the film. Watching their over the top personalities collide is like watching a dark British version of old Looney Tune cartoons. Even if this film had no plot at all, it could probably be sold on these insane characters alone. To match their larger than life personalities, most of the characters will also have weird but memorable names including Borris the Blade (Rade Serbedzija) a Russian gun dealer with the ability to dodge bullets and Brick Top (Alan Ford) a British gangster who rigged boxing matches and has an aggressive streak, chopping up any person who crosses him in to pieces and feeding them to pigs. But no character in the film is quite as bizarrely enjoyable as Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt). He's a Irish Gypsy traveller who is a bare boxing champion with the ability to knock his opponents out in one punch. He's given an Irish accent that even an Irish man would find hard to follow at points, largely in response to criticisms in the first film that many of the London accents could be hard to follow for American audiences. So this character was made so both the audience and other characters couldn't understand him. And he uses this to his advantage, setting up unfair deals and swindling all the English men out of their pockets. Even beyond the main characters, every side character are also very enjoyable. They seem to have a Coens Brother kind of charm to them when even if they were only on screen for 30 seconds, they kept you laughing so much in that short time that you'll still be able to leave the film thinking of them. Either because of the short dialogue having a distinct British charm to them or just because of great casting (like having a slow moving fat man as the getaway driver for a heist) that just ensures the characters all leave a lasting impression. Another great part about the comedy in this film is Ritchie is one of the few directors to still use the visual medium effectively to bring the laughs in his comedies. As smart and quotable as the dialogue in the film is (Why do they call him the bullet-dodger? Cause he dodges bullets) the films visuals are where Ritchie real skill takes over. The use of clever editing tricks like freeze framing on a stupid face or fast editing taking you off guard in a split second allows this film to have its own distinct mark on you.Out of all of his films so far this is definitely Ritchie's career high point. Its impressive soundtrack, instantly quotable dialogue and memorable visuals are both very enjoyable and easily re-watchable. It's quite easily one of my favourite comedies to come out in years.

Despite the film being released 76 years ago, it is still one of those rare gems that clicks with today's audience. Sure it has a rather simple story, but it's a resonant film that features groundbreaking visuals (that famous twister scene, anyone?), themes that can relate to anyone (courage, having a heart, etc), famous music that became a part of pop culture lore, and just a simple fantasy story that is fun to watch and is suitable for all ages. The story itself has the feel of a 1939 movie, but those visuals are still mightily impressive. The twister scene is just amazing, and it still fathoms me to see how they created all the flying objects seem realistic. The production design is amazing as well, as we get a very colorful film. Keep in mind that during this era, most films were black and white. The yellow brick road is a delight to look at, especially occupied by the central characters. The story is simple enough to follow, and it's one for all ages. Dorothy is whisked away from her Kansas farmland by a tornado, and it transports her to the magical land of Oz. Dorothy desperately wants to go home, but she is tasked with finding the wizard of Oz in Emerald City. She must follow the yellow brick road, where she finds allies in a talking scarecrow, a tin man, and a cowardly lion. But she also must avoid the Wicked Witch of the West if she wants to get home safely. The film is full of pure, magical performances. Judy Garland, a well- known name in 1939, was transported to stardom after the success of this movie. Her acting method is different by today's standard, but she effectively carries the movie as the kind-hearted Dorothy. Margaret Hamilton's performance was very scary, and rumor has it that much of her performance was edited due to it being scary. I imagine what her performance could have been if there was no editing. I also liked Ray Bolger, as the scarecrow trying to find a brain, Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion looking for courage, and Jack Haley as the tin man looking for a heart. Everyone delivers praise-worthy performances here. While not an instant box-office success when first released, the Wizard of Oz delivers magic, wisdom, and just a great movie to the audience all around the world. From the magical tunes of Somewhere over the Rainbow, to the interplay between Miss Gulch and Dorothy, to the experience with the Wizard of Oz, we have ourselves an unforgettable classic, which began with the writings of L. Frank Baum. I have seen this film many times, and it is still a fantastic delight to watch. Once I'm transported to Oz, I'm no place like home, as Dorothy so kindly tells Toto, her dog. Once again, a classic movie for all ages.

Basically Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Cronin (Phoebe Cates) is having the worst time of her life, she has her purse and car stolen, she is fired from her job, and she finds out that her husband Charles (Tim Matheson) has cheated on her, but she cannot stop loving him, despite support from her friend Janie (Carrie Fisher) she is unhappy. In misery, Lizzie remembers her happy times in childhood as a young girl (Ashley Peldon), specifically playing with and messing about with her imaginary friend, Drop Dead Fred (Rik Mayall), and all of the sudden, Fred reappears. Fred has a sole purpose, to cheer Lizzie up, but this is not going to plan, especially with Lizzie's quite cold mother Polly (Marsha Mason) around, who wants to turn her daughter into a younger double of herself. Lizzie works to get Charles back, and even though she is overjoyed to see Fred again and remember the fun times they had when she was a child, he only seems to cause trouble for her. After a number of unforgivable action, which Lizzie blames Fred for (just like in the past), her mother takes her to get help and get rid of Fred forever, Lizzie is given medication to take, but she realises as she is about to take the final pill that Charles has not changed, Fred is the only person she can trust. She follows Fred to a dream world and gets the chance to conquer her greatest fears her mother, Charles's infidelity and the little girl inside her dealing with loneliness, unfortunately the only way she can truly rid herself of these fears is to lose Fred for good and realise she does not need him anymore. In the end Lizzie kisses Fred goodbye, waking from this dream she leaves Charles, she initially argues with Polly, who she blamed for her father leaving, but the mother and daughter reconcile, and meeting up with Mickey Bunce (Ron Eldard) they seem to express interest in being more than friends, she notices his daughter Natalie (Kelly Benson) playing and causing trouble, blaming Fred, even though she can no longer see him Lizzier realises Fred is now Natalie's imaginary friend, she smiles. Also starring Bridget Fonda as Annabella, Keith Charles as Murray and Daniel Gerroll as Nigel Cronin. Mayall with his big red hair and bright green clothes does bring the manic high energy you'd expect from him, and Cates is nice as the girl who is the only person who can see him, it might have been a good idea, but it goes from amusing to irritating a fair amount, and is predictable and almost completely unfunny, stick to James Stewart classic Harvey if you want a film about an invisible friend, this is a mess of a fantasy comedy.
