Classic lines like, Do it my way with the cesarean, We ain't great--we're just a bunch of guys from Jersey, and the all time rocker, WORDS AND MUSIC (with the appropriate finger gesture), can be heard in every recording studio and rehearsal room in the English speaking world.So if you're a musician--or even if you just want to hang out with musicians--you must watch this film, otherwise you'll look like a total n00b.Even to non-musical audiences, this movie is a work of art. It's a nostalgic and poetic trip back to the early 1960s when America was just emerging from its cocoon of innocence. The entire film is a metaphor for this. Eddie's music, like life itself, dared to venture beyond the bubble gum into a world of complex social and personal issues... literally, the Dark Side of American life.Once you grasp this fundamental theme, you will appreciate the entire film on a deep level. It's not just a rock'n'roll romp. It's a profound commentary on the growing pains our society endured in the 2nd half of the 20th century. Told in flashback, the story takes on a particularly tragic air, as if you were browsing through a dusty old scrapbook of your childhood memories, now gone forever.The story\/mystery is set in the first 5 minutes, and for the remaining 90 mins it unravels concurrently in 2 timelines to a brilliant finale. Acting is absolutely flawless, camera-work is both tense and dreamy, and the clincher is the fantastic music, a retro soundtrack by John Cafferty with songs you'd swear you'd heard from the 50s but were actually written in 1980 On the Dark Side, Tender Years & Wild Summer Nights to name some of the best. Check em out on Youtube if you can.Vivid characters bring this story to life. In Eddie and the Cruisers, the two lead characters personify the duality of a soul. First there's Eddie (Michael Paré) who is the dark, explosive force yearning to evolve. His counterpart is the naïve kid Ridgeway (played by Tom Berenger showing off his amazing versatility as an actor--just 2 years before his role in Platoon as the sadistic Vietnam commander. Can you believe it's the same guy?!). The two characters wrestle with each other, at times best friends, at times worst enemies, but always bound together by the thread of music. I'll leave you to discover the philosophical implications of their conflict and its outcome.Notable supporting performances are made by young actors Joe Pantoliana (Risky Business, The Fugitive, The Matrix, perhaps best known for The Sopranos), Matthew Laurance (tons of 80s-90s TV), Ellen Barkin (The Big Easy), and Eddie's girl played by Helen Schneider who surprisingly never did any other feature films.Some people criticize this film as being B grade or cheezy. Sure, why not. To me, that only added to its charm. The 80s itself was a time of innocence & simplicity relative to today's gritty cinema. Isn't it fitting that we, living in our mega-produced, paranoid, cynical new millennium would enjoy watching an honest 80s flick which itself is taking a look back to the warmth of its prior generation? It's like a window within a window. Don't miss the magic of this experience.I've seen 20 or 30 rock'n'roll films and this is hands down my favorite. Other faves include, by decade they depict, Jailhouse Rock (a surprisingly angsty 50s Elvis flick), of course Eddie (early 60s) and Head (late 60s trippy Monkees flick), Spinal Tap (a 70s metal spoof), Music & Lyrics (an 80s pop spoof), Anvil! The Story of Anvil (80s thru present day comeback attempt\/comedy\/documentary) and Garage Days (a 90s Aussie rock comedy by the director of The Crow). Worthy of note is Looking for an Echo (2000) by the same writer\/director who did Eddie, it presents a parallel story of what might've happened to a 50s singer if he slowly faded into obscurity.Hope this review made sense to you. I nearly broke my fingers typing it. Haha. Watch the movie and you'll get it.P.S. If you see the film, make note that Wendell the sax player is actually the one who played sax on the soundtrack.

Actors near my age and my older brothers' ages,the (then) cool look of their uniforms and without a doubt,that scene in the the ad where the students are overhead with their guns pointed at the adults,I.E. rebellion.

No offense to those who did attend an academy,there are those who actually do get something out of it,but for my own life experience and views,I'll more than likely never understand what that would be. Self discipline can be taught to one's self just as easily.Anyhow,getting back to the film. As a movie it was quite the intense experience. George C. Scott was great in it but I really wish his character had not been removed from the story. I felt he brought these kids a level measure of control and a wiser voice of reason. Timothy Hutton,Sean Penn and (aside from the younger kids)the 17\/18 year old Tom Cruise are all fantastic in their roles. In the case of Penn & Cruise a pre-view of good things to come for them as actors.Penn is a great friend to Hutton's character and this may seem like a simple role at first but as the story goes on his performance builds on itself with his still very fresh abilities as an actor.Cruise is unsettling but electric as the cadet who likes the power & control he's been trained with just a little too much. Resulting in the climactic scene where he goes trigger-happy with a machine gun near the end of the film. It's beautiful man! is the most remembered line from the whole film.Hutton,the veteran actor of the 3,plays a young man who has a more idealistic view of his education at the academy and of the overall meaning. It's more like an elegant party for him and his hanging out with old soldiers. The taking of the academy by the students was handled convincingly enough but the idea that they'd bring in tanks and the real army seemed a bit much. The pressure of that later resulting in a bit of a dissension between Penn & Hutton.The thing that has not set to well with those that have seen this movie is the senseless killing of a boy who's only about 10 or 11 by the military. Even over 27 years later,it still feels like it was not a necessary thing to put in this movie to make the point of what happens to these boys when they end up in a real war. The point was made long before that. It was equally unnerving for me to realize that even kids that age can stop living'.That nearly fatal story choice aside,the film really is great. The best thing one can do before watching is just put aside your left or right views and just watch it as you would any other movie. What I learned years later is not to let myself get so deep into the politics and just keep in mind,that's Hollywood and the film-makers ideas and\/or ideals.

In the case of Penn & Cruise a pre-view of good things to come for them as actors.Penn is a great friend to Hutton's character and this may seem like a simple role at first but as the story goes on his performance builds on itself with his still very fresh abilities as an actor.Cruise is unsettling but electric as the cadet who likes the power & control he's been trained with just a little too much. Resulting in the climactic scene where he goes trigger-happy with a machine gun near the end of the film. It's beautiful man! is the most remembered line from the whole film.Hutton,the veteran actor of the 3,plays a young man who has a more idealistic view of his education at the academy and of the overall meaning. It's more like an elegant party for him and his hanging out with old soldiers. The taking of the academy by the students was handled convincingly enough but the idea that they'd bring in tanks and the real army seemed a bit much. The pressure of that later resulting in a bit of a dissension between Penn & Hutton.The thing that has not set to well with those that have seen this movie is the senseless killing of a boy who's only about 10 or 11 by the military. Even over 27 years later,it still feels like it was not a necessary thing to put in this movie to make the point of what happens to these boys when they end up in a real war. The point was made long before that. It was equally unnerving for me to realize that even kids that age can stop living'.That nearly fatal story choice aside,the film really is great. The best thing one can do before watching is just put aside your left or right views and just watch it as you would any other movie.

I'm sure in the TV advertisements the appeal was obvious. Actors near my age and my older brothers' ages,the (then) cool look of their uniforms and without a doubt,that scene in the the ad where the students are overhead with their guns pointed at the adults,I.E. rebellion. Hard to find a pre-teen or teen-age boy who wouldn't find this kind of thing appealing. In the new Reagan,conservative '80s era it was fitting. One's point of view can only describe to that person what this film is all about. Some have felt this film is pro-war,while others (like me) feel it's th opposite. I find it to be even more than that though. It seemed to me that it's just as I stated above. The naive' appeal of war and weapons to young minds,as well as the parents who send their kids to these kinds of places to shape them up. No offense to those who did attend an academy,there are those who actually do get something out of it,but for my own life experience and views,I'll more than likely never understand what that would be. Self discipline can be taught to one's self just as easily.Anyhow,getting back to the film. As a movie it was quite the intense experience. George C. Scott was great in it but I really wish his character had not been removed from the story. I felt he brought these kids a level measure of control and a wiser voice of reason.

Norman heads back to his home town & his motel, while working in a roadside diner Norman meets & befriends young waitress Mary Samuels (Meg Tilly). After Mary is dumped by her boyfriend Norman invites her to stay with him in his large house which she does. At first Norman seems fine & perfectly sane but he starts receiving phone-calls & hand written notes from his mother, his dead mother. Then when dead bodies start to turn up it seems Norman may be up to his old tricks...Directed by Richard Franklin this sequel to Alfred Hitchcock's classic original is actually a pretty good psychological thriller with a hint of teen slasher film thrown in there for the 80's crowd's. Hitchcock made the original Psycho in 1960 & I guess no-one wanted to make a sequel while the great man was still around so when Hitchcock died in 1980 it's no real coincidence that both this filmed sequel & Robert Bloch's novel Psycho II (both of which are completely different) were produced. The script here by Tom Holland (who appears in the film as Deputy Norris) is a clever follow up to the original, there's plenty of good twist's & turns especially at the end when all the the events of the film come together really nicely in a somewhat bleak series of incidents & coincidences. I liked it but the problem with a film such as this where all it's impact & effectiveness comes from it's surprises & twist's is that once you've seen it the main strengths of the film are lost forever & as such has little in the way of replay value. The character's are all well written & fleshed out, there's some good dialogue & I like how the plot progresses. At around 110 minutes long there's plenty of time for the plot to develop, the pace is pretty good although a bit slow on occasion so don't expect lots of action as Psycho II relies on clever storytelling & some great twist's.The motel was rebuilt for the film in meticulous detail & the sets & look of the film overall feels a lot like the original. To cater for the 80's audience there's some nudity here as this time a shower scene yields some naked female flesh rather than a brutal murder & there's some slasher style murders with a stabbing, slashings, someone gets a large knife stuck into their mouth & a rotten corpse is seen. Apparently the telly version is padded out with extra scenes although at 110 minutes I think it's long enough as it is.With a supposed budget of about $5,000,000 Psycho II has good production values & some stylish cinematography with some very effective lighting. Shot mostly on the Universal Studios back-lot, the same one that recently burnt down. Meg Tilly has publicly gone on record as saying her worst experience in the film business was working with Anthony Perkins in this while both Perkins & Vera Miles return from the original. Robert Loggia & Dennis Franz supply good support.Psycho II was a much better film than I was expecting, it does try to please the 80's crowd a bit & once you know the twist's you will never be able to watch it in quite the same way again but for a first time viewing this is a clever psychological thriller with some neat surprises.

Now before I go into the reasons why I hate this movie I won't to show you just how much I was just like the rest of the world anticipating this movie. I love Star Wars and for me the original trilogy was the reason I love movies. So when in 1993 it was announced that George Lucas was going to write a prequel trilogy I was in Cloud Nine ! I thought I was going to see a great story about how one of my favorite characters in cinema history  Darth Vader , turned from good to evil . I was filled with anticipation and spent the next 6 years following every piece of Star Wars news that was released. And when that they day in May came I couldn't wait to see it. However I was so wrong ! The film actually started well but as soon as the Jedi arrive on Naboo the film goes downhill ! As the film finished I asked myself  Why is this film so bad ? How can a Star Wars film never leave me with the magic it always does ? After viewing the film for a second time I came up with many reasons .The film's story is a complete miss-mash of politics , Jedi and diverse and stupid sub-plots . Now I love politics and I love films about politics . But why oh why does George Lucas have to include tons of dialogue involving politics ! The plot is also confusing and leads you to ask questions  What is the Trade Federation ? Why are they causing war ? Why is Tattoine not in the Republic ? In my opinion George Lucas made a huge mistake to introduce us to Anakin as a 9 year old boy . He should have been 13 or 14 not 9. In this film we see the future Dark Lord of the Sith as a 9 year old boy racing pods and shouting 'yipee' . There are other characters in this film which are completely miscasted and a waste. Obi Wan for example just runs around the place and contradicts his master. Yoda , supposedly the most powerful Jedi of all time just sits on his a** talking ! But in my opinion the character which could have been so much more and could have over taken Darth Vader as my favorite Star wars character but in a 90 minute movie , how many words does he utter , 14 ! Yes 14 words ! What a waste ! This brings me to another point. The Dialogue in any Star Wars movie is not great and never has been . But this movie is the King of all Bad Dialogue Movies. Some lines are even pathetic like for example the first line we hear the future Dark Lord speak 'are you an angel ?'This film has good cgi and special effects I Can admit that but without a good story and good dialogue it is useless. Even when you think about it the story is just a more modern looking version of the Original Star Wars there is a journey to another planet , a jedi master dies and a Skywalker ends up blowing up the big space station. But know you would ask what did I expect from this film ? Well I expected a good story first of all and the story should have been only about Anakin ! Forget about the Republic and the Quuen and Jar Jar just focus on Anakin and thats why this film fails . Is there anything about this film which I like ( besides Darth Maul) well I appreciate that George Lucas tried to show new elements to the Star Wars galaxy which makes sense since it is a Republic but there are some elements which just don't feel like Star Wars like Gungans and battle droids for example. I also like Qui Gon Jinn as a character and it is thanks to him that this movie is not one of the worst of all time. There was also the final lightsaber battle which in my opinion was the best in all 6 films. In conclusion for me this film was a major disappointment and doesn't deserve the name 'Star Wars'.

Yes 14 words ! What a waste ! This brings me to another point. The Dialogue in any Star Wars movie is not great and never has been . But this movie is the King of all Bad Dialogue Movies. Some lines are even pathetic like for example the first line we hear the future Dark Lord speak 'are you an angel ?'This film has good cgi and special effects I Can admit that but without a good story and good dialogue it is useless. Even when you think about it the story is just a more modern looking version of the Original Star Wars there is a journey to another planet , a jedi master dies and a Skywalker ends up blowing up the big space station. But know you would ask what did I expect from this film ? Well I expected a good story first of all and the story should have been only about Anakin ! Forget about the Republic and the Quuen and Jar Jar just focus on Anakin and thats why this film fails . Is there anything about this film which I like ( besides Darth Maul) well I appreciate that George Lucas tried to show new elements to the Star Wars galaxy which makes sense since it is a Republic but there are some elements which just don't feel like Star Wars like Gungans and battle droids for example. I also like Qui Gon Jinn as a character and it is thanks to him that this movie is not one of the worst of all time. There was also the final lightsaber battle which in my opinion was the best in all 6 films. In conclusion for me this film was a major disappointment and doesn't deserve the name 'Star Wars'. Poor dialogue , bad acting and a terrible storyline make it a far cry from the original films. 4.1\/10 Luke Mizzi ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"15 November 2008","score":"","review":" Definitely paving the road that Tarantino should have gone down, From Dusk Til Dawn is one of my all time favorite movies.

His werewolf picture features some truly frightening monsters, several of the most impressive transformation sequences anyone could desire, and a cast that is itself a tribute to the classic horror pictures of the past. In the film, we meet TV news anchor Karen White, appealingly played by Dee Wallace a year before E.T. would make her a household name. After a traumatizing run-in with a serial killer, Karen and her husband (played by Dee's then real-life husband Christopher Stone) go up the California coast to rest and recuperate at The Colony, an alternative-lifestyle, group-therapy retreat of sorts run by a pop psychiatrist (the ever suave Patrick Macnee). At this late date, I don't think I'm spoiling the party too much by stating that The Colony's residents are a pretty, uh, hairy bunch of folk! Dante directs his film skillfully, and although he reserves most of Rob Bottin and Rick Baker's remarkable FX for the final third, the viewer is constantly afflicted with a feeling of unease, leavened by much insider humor. That great cast of horror vets--including John Carradine, Kevin McCarthy, Kenneth Tobey and Dick Miller (hilarious as antique bookseller Walter Paisley...the same name he sported in Roger Corman's 1959 quickie A Bucket of Blood!), plus cult fave Slim Pickens and appearances by Corman himself and horror editor Forrest J. Ackerman--is truly a godsend, and some likable newcomers, such as the late Elisabeth Brooks, with her Angelina Jolie-like good looks, and Robert Picardo, who few will recognize as the holographic Doctor from Star Trek Voyager, make significant contributions.

I've got every Bond film on DVD, including Casino Royale on Blu Ray and every year or so I go through the series and watch them all. Obviously each Bond brings something different to the series, and Pierce was just fantastic (I just wish Die Another Day hadn't turned out the film it was because I thought his first three were all very good films in there own right, but the 4th kind of put a bad mark on Pierce's reign). Obviously Bond these days have gone in a different direction just like FOR YOUR EYES ONLY did after MOONRAKER, but thats whats great about watching the series, Bond changes with the times.

As a kid I had loved Roger Moore's bond films, because as a kid they were just fun films to watch, with classic villains like Jaws.

These days I see it has a classic Bond adventure, its got the gadgets, the diabolical villain, and the best Bond since Sean Connery, though it lacks a classic Bond girl, has Teri Hatchers role was very small (though I did love the scene in the hotel room, classic Bond moment there) and Michelle Yeoh was not a Bond girl in any sense, but I did love her part as it brought something different to the franchise. The actions scenes are top notch (and over the top but thats the fun of watching a James Bond film). The car chase and then later on the bike chase are fantastic scenes, and Pierce Brosnan is just so suave as 007. There's two types of Bond adventures, the classic Bond (GOLDFINGER, THE SPY WHO LOVED ME for example) and then the more gritty Bond (CASINO ROYALE, LICENCE TO KILL, FROM Russia WITH LOVE). This falls into the classic Bond. I do like both types, as it always keep the Bond series fresh as it changes over the decades. If your a Bond fan who doesn't like the classic Bond then this isn't a film for you, your best sticking to the (FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, CASINO ROYALE) gritty Bonds.

The planet is saved. A handful of heroic survivors are awarded medals in the ruins of Washington by Natalie Portman as the president's daughter while a mariachi band, the only musicians left alive, play the national anthem.The iconography of the alien ships and their exploits are directly derived from Earth Versus The Flying Saucers.

You want to conquer the earth, you need lawyers, right? As the president, Nicholson makes a tear-jerking speech to the Martians about joining forces in friendship.

This film is like filth coated with gold shavings, and beneath it's flashy exterior, there is no other reason to see this, unless you're twelve years old or younger.Evil inventor and confederate Arliss Loveless (Keneth Branaugh) is on the move, and it's up to veteran of the civil war, James West (Will Smith) and good guy inventor Artemis Gordon (Kevin Kline) to stop him. To add to the eye candy, Salma Hayek is thrown in the picture when West and Gordon rescue her from Loveless, and she literally has nothing interesting to say or do, adding to the general tone of the film. When Loveless is out to kill President Ulysses S. Grant, West and Gordon really have to try their darnedest to stop him, but it's not going to be easy, when he has invented a giant mechanical spider. The craziness and chaos ensues.I'll start with the positives, though I have already stated the sole positive aspect of the film. This is a great looking movie. The west has never looked so vibrant and colorful. The special effects add to the dumb and goofy storyline, but they also look really cool.The negatives...where should I start. The acting is not horrible, but it's not good either. Kenneth Branaguh is mainly known for his directing and acting of Shakespearean plays, and in those plays he gives over the top performances. He does the same here, and though he is a fairly dastardly villain, at the same time, it's hard to take him seriously. Will Smith has charisma and charm, but he acts just like he does in every other movie. This is the late 1800s, not 1999, so why does still act like a modern guy? Because that's what the fans want, and that's what the idiot writers came up with. The plot is really stupid, as is the script as is most of this train wreck.Some scenes may look cool, but they don't make sense. For instance, in one scene, the camera is about 30 feet away from the President who is at the opening of a new railroad. Everyone including the president is blissfully unaware that Loveless is coming with the giant improbable spider. We see the spider's giant leg step into frame, and then the President realizes that he is under attack. This little technique used here is trying to surprise the characters and the audience at the same time, but it just doesn't make sense. Why wouldn't the president be able to see the spider before we do? It's coming towards him on a flat plain with no trees. He should be able to see this thing from a mile away, not when it gets right next to him. Another scene features Gordon and West riding on what we assume are horses. The camera backs up, and we see they are actually on the giant spider, and as the camera backs up, we begin to hear the loud noises this machine is making. Why does backing up make us hear the spider, because logically it shouldn't. It's that same awful technique of revealing something to the audience in a scary or humorous manner, whether or not it makes sense.Though I could gaze at this movie's beauty for a long while, at the same time it makes my brain hurt from under use, and my ears bleed from awful dialogue. Eight year old boys will probably give this flick a standing ovation, but most others will start to turn this off as the life gets sucked out of them.My rating * out of ****. 105 mins. PG-13 for language, violence and some sexual comments.

Why wouldn't the president be able to see the spider before we do? It's coming towards him on a flat plain with no trees. He should be able to see this thing from a mile away, not when it gets right next to him. Another scene features Gordon and West riding on what we assume are horses. The camera backs up, and we see they are actually on the giant spider, and as the camera backs up, we begin to hear the loud noises this machine is making. Why does backing up make us hear the spider, because logically it shouldn't. It's that same awful technique of revealing something to the audience in a scary or humorous manner, whether or not it makes sense.Though I could gaze at this movie's beauty for a long while, at the same time it makes my brain hurt from under use, and my ears bleed from awful dialogue. Eight year old boys will probably give this flick a standing ovation, but most others will start to turn this off as the life gets sucked out of them.My rating * out of ****. 105 mins. PG-13 for language, violence and some sexual comments. ","genre":"Action, Western, Comedy"},{"date":"15 November 2008","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Aside from the flashy looks and beautiful scenery of this movie, this is absolutely nothing but corny action, bad dialogue, mediocre acting and nonsensical direction. This film is like filth coated with gold shavings, and beneath it's flashy exterior, there is no other reason to see this, unless you're twelve years old or younger.Evil inventor and confederate Arliss Loveless (Keneth Branaugh) is on the move, and it's up to veteran of the civil war, James West (Will Smith) and good guy inventor Artemis Gordon (Kevin Kline) to stop him. To add to the eye candy, Salma Hayek is thrown in the picture when West and Gordon rescue her from Loveless, and she literally has nothing interesting to say or do, adding to the general tone of the film. When Loveless is out to kill President Ulysses S. Grant, West and Gordon really have to try their darnedest to stop him, but it's not going to be easy, when he has invented a giant mechanical spider. The craziness and chaos ensues.I'll start with the positives, though I have already stated the sole positive aspect of the film. This is a great looking movie. The west has never looked so vibrant and colorful. The special effects add to the dumb and goofy storyline, but they also look really cool.The negatives...where should I start. The acting is not horrible, but it's not good either. Kenneth Branaguh is mainly known for his directing and acting of Shakespearean plays, and in those plays he gives over the top performances. He does the same here, and though he is a fairly dastardly villain, at the same time, it's hard to take him seriously. Will Smith has charisma and charm, but he acts just like he does in every other movie. This is the late 1800s, not 1999, so why does still act like a modern guy? Because that's what the fans want, and that's what the idiot writers came up with. The plot is really stupid, as is the script as is most of this train wreck.Some scenes may look cool, but they don't make sense. For instance, in one scene, the camera is about 30 feet away from the President who is at the opening of a new railroad. Everyone including the president is blissfully unaware that Loveless is coming with the giant improbable spider. We see the spider's giant leg step into frame, and then the President realizes that he is under attack.
