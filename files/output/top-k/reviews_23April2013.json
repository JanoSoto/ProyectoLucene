Clearly, it uses 'Star Trek' as an influence, but one doesn't have to be a Trek fan to like this movie and enjoy it...although that certainly wouldn't hurt.The concept isn't wholly original, but that hardly matters (just to use one example, it's like Three Amigos! in space); it still works. A talented ensemble play the cast of a Trek like cult favourite TV series who are now reduced to appearing at conventions and store sales. They get the surprise of their life when an actual alien race - the Thermians - approach them and implore them to save the aliens from being exterminated by a ruthless enemy. You see, the Thermians have seen the show, but naively believed it to be fact and not fiction! (They lament the fate of those poor people on 'Gilligan's Island'!)So it's up to the intrepid actors to play their parts for real, and embark on a series of challenges. Tim Allen is Jason Nesmith, the egocentric star of the show, Sigourney Weaver is Gwen DeMarco, the stunning blonde whose only purpose seems to be parroting whatever the computer tells the cast, Alan Rickman is Alexander Dane, the illustrious thespian who considers his alien role to be beneath him (he goes through the entire movie with his makeup on!), Tony Shalhoub is the unflappable Fred Kwan, Daryl Mitchell is ship pilot Tommy Webber, and Sam Rockwell does a hilarious job of paying tribute to every red shirt wearing, expendable minor character to ever appear on 'Star Trek'. They're all great, especially Rickman and Rockwell, but Enrico Colantoni also deserves a mention as he hilariously plays Mathesar, the Thermian leader who speaks his English in an awkward, sing song way. Look also for Justin Long as a nerdy teen and Rainn Wilson as one of the Thermians.The dialogue is often quite good, the special effects are impressive, and Stan Winstons' studio create some nifty looking creatures, among them the Thermians who have a rather Cthulhu like look when not disguised as humans, and the big angry villainous lobster Sarris (Robin Sachs). The movie does go on a little long, and get silly towards the end, but overall it has a real charm to it and it's pretty hard to resist. Comedy and science fiction fans alike should find it quite agreeable.Eight out of 10.

A Little Princess director Alfonso Cuarón and Scrooged scenarist Mitch Glazer maintain that venerable Tinsel Town tradition with the latest cinematic adaptation of Great Expectations, a boy-meets-girl and boy-loses-girl tearjerker. Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Robert De Niro, and Anne Bancroft topline this entertaining but offbeat social drama. Tony Burrough's elegant production designs, Reality Bites lenser Emmanuel Lubezki's lush cinematography, and Cuaron's own poetic vision bolster Great Expectations far above Glazer's loquacious as well as predictable screenplay. Great Expectations qualifies easily as either a chick flick or a date flick, unless you're going to compare it with the six previous versions produced either for the silver screen or the boob tube.Unless you have scanned the Cliff Notes for Great Expectations recently, you may find yourself swamped by this free-spirited adaptation. Hollywood has changed some things. Glazer uproots the plot from its original Victorian English setting and transplants it to contemporary Florida. Charles Dickens named his protagonist Pip, but Glazer gives him the name Finn. Undoubtedly, literary types are struggling to figure out what a Mark Twain nickname and an Ernst Hemingway setting can have in common with a Dickens tale. Me, too. My B.A. was in English Literature and I've never seen Dickens like this. Not only does Glazer rechristen his lead character, but also he rechristens Miss Havisham as Ms. Dinsmoor. The criminal Magwitch is now Arthur Lustig, a death-row inmate who killed a mob boss. Estella is still Estella. Of course, Cuarón has altered several other things, too, but that will give you literature professors something to bitch about in class. Condensing a Dickens' epic in less than two hours in a film with names that you can pronounce might have something to do with this nonsense.Briefly, Finnegan Bell (Ethan Hawke of Dead Poets Society) takes life easy in sunny coastal Florida, just the kind of lifestyle Huckleberry Finn would yearn for in his wildest dreams. Orphaned, Finn resides with Maggie, his weirdo sister (Kim Dickens of Brazil), and Joe, his lower class, brother-in-law, handyman (Chris Cooper of Lone Star). Joe has trouble keeping food on the table and money in his pocket, so Maggie bails on them. Great Expectations makes women look like kennel club members, while the men emerge as good people who take care of one other. Finn spends his time cruising around in his outboard when he is not drawing pictures. Francesco Clemente received credit for those drawings, but he must have been channeling Walter Anderson. One day, the vicious convict Lustig (Robert De Nero of Goodfellas) surprises Finn and forces him to help him escape. The escape plan goes sour for Lusting, but Finn gets away. Finn fares far less lucky during his next encounter. He meets an eccentric unmarried woman, Ms. Dinsmoor (Anne Bancroft of The Graduate). She is a dotty old dame abandoned at the altar by a worthless suitor. Languishing away in a magnificent mansion that has gradually gone to seed since her disastrous wedding day, Dinsmoor has left things the way they had been set up for the wedding ceremony. Great Expectations looks like a feminine version of Heart of Darkness, but let us not trash a great guy like Joseph Conrad.Ms. Dinsmoor, it seems, wants a playmate for her snotty niece Estella, so she pages and pays for Finn. Poor Finn is immediately entranced by the cold, haughty Estella. Estella shocks Finn with a surprise kiss at a water fountain, and the filmmakers make that a recurring scene. When Finn reveals that he cannot dance for her, Ms. Dinsmoor allows him to draw. Reluctant initially to pose, Estella finds herself forced to sit for his portrait. Finn thinks she is beautiful but snobbish. Ms. Dinsmoor lectures Finn about the incompatibility of the sexes and the irony of love. Every time Finn meets Estella, she treats him indifferently, leaving him before anything can happen. She is the stuck-up, ice maiden of all time until the ending, but until then Finn recklessly pursues her. The unhappy day comes when Estella leaves Florida and travels to France for her education. Meanwhile, Finn sticks around Florida, works with Joe as a commercial fisherman and gives up painting. Suddenly, fortune befriends inn. Not only does he learn a benefactor has paid his airfare to New York City, but also that an art show is scheduled for his work. Quickly, Finn pulls together some new works and becomes an overnight sensation. Nevertheless, he still has problems with Estella. She takes up with a well-heeled architect, Walter Plane (Hank Azaria), and Finn's dreams appear to elude him again&#x97;almost, but you will have to suffer through the sorrow to see what happens.Great Expectations is a sensational looking picture. Emmanuel Lubezki's postcard photography is so gorgeous that at times it distracts you from the story. Everything in Great Expectations has a soft, ethereal texture. Tony Burroughs' cluttered looking production designs come the closest to recapturing the Victorian spirit of Charles Dickens. The Dinsmoor mansion is fantastic in its excessive, back-to-nature grunge. The story maybe as old as Dickens, but director Alfonso Cuarón makes it a richly palatable experience. He jump-starts the action occasionally. For example, during a dancing scene between the young Finn and Estella, Cuarón dissolves to the grown-up Finn and Estella without altering the scenery. Cuarón is especially adept with the appropriate light touch in treating the erotic scenes with flair and ingenuity. Paltrow strips for Hawke in one scene (remind you of Titanic) so he can draw her in the nude. Meantime, the only nudity shown appears on paper. A later erotic encounter tastefully skirts the issue by letting your imagination do the rest. See, it's a chick flick. If you want a good cry, Great Expectations will live up to your anticipations.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"23 April 2013","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Dudley Do-Right has a title that its badness could suggest be used for various puns of the sort. I believe a number of jokes could be made at the fact that it failed to recoup roughly eighty-six percent of its $70,000,000 budget. I seem to have an ounce of sympathy for the fact that numerous talents such as Brendan Fraser, Sarah Jessica Parker, and director Hugh Wilson in such a desperation for a quick-fix or a cash-grab that they needed to make a film based off a character I'm sure American audiences could've stomached not seeing again. So making a joke from this material seems sort of beneath me; at any rate, the fact that a studio and investors spent $70,000,000 on a Dudley Do-Right movie is a joke in itself.I can't remember the last time it was such a chore for me to sit through a seventy-seven minute movie. I became so restless that I couldn't even focus. You know how the new theater trend that is slowly emerging is autistic-friendly theaters, which are theaters that lack previews, remain a bit lighter during the show, are a tad quieter, and blunt movement and conversation is allowed, even encouraged? That kind of theater experience should've been a standard for Dudley Do-Right during its initial release. To expect an audience to remain silent during this under normal theater conditions is an act of pure torture. The only way I could've remained silent is if I slept.Preceding the film is a short called The Phox, the Box, and the Lox, which involves a conniving Phox tricks a bone-headed Lox into opening a box that states whoever opens this will die to recover the treasure inside. This short only lasts about five minutes and it's a drag to sit through. How infrequently do I see a film with a preceding trailer that maintains the same sort of mood and effect that its successor will soon have.The film focuses on our title character, of course, a Canadian Mountie played by Brendan Fraser, who is often victim to his naivety and do-right attitude about everything life has to offer. His childhood friend Snidely (Alfred Molina) now has ambitions to take over the area where Dudley works, resulting in one of the biggest gold schemes in history. Dudley teams up with his childhood crush Nell (Sarah Jessica Parker) in an effort to spoil Snidley's plans at success and domination.Does this sound like the kind of gripping tale you want to let yourself and your children indulge in?

The extremely high budget suggests he was compensated well, but his dignity was left undernourished as we see him victim to horse-farts, blows to the head, blows to the ego, etc. It gets beyond monotonous. How many times can you watch the same joke be repeated before you, as the helpless viewer, throw your arms up in utter defeat? I have never seen the Dudley Do-Right shorts that spawned this film and, much like after I watched the Scooby-Doo film adaptation, I have no plan to now. However, from a relatively quick glance, they seem like the kind of drudgery that was undoubtedly boosted in quality by how much sugar was in a young boy or girl's system. I don't believe any amount of sugar could make this film more bearable than it is.Dudley Do-Right is not a funny movie by any stretch of imagination. Its exposition is tired and facile, its self-referential toilet humor is ridiculous and redundant, its actors succumb themselves to some of the driest material, the sight-gags are routine, and its hero is so dreadfully incompetent that one wants to show him the way to the wardrobe for a costume change and into the breakroom.Starring Brendan Fraser, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Alfred Molina.

I believe a number of jokes could be made at the fact that it failed to recoup roughly eighty-six percent of its $70,000,000 budget. I seem to have an ounce of sympathy for the fact that numerous talents such as Brendan Fraser, Sarah Jessica Parker, and director Hugh Wilson in such a desperation for a quick-fix or a cash-grab that they needed to make a film based off a character I'm sure American audiences could've stomached not seeing again. So making a joke from this material seems sort of beneath me; at any rate, the fact that a studio and investors spent $70,000,000 on a Dudley Do-Right movie is a joke in itself.I can't remember the last time it was such a chore for me to sit through a seventy-seven minute movie. I became so restless that I couldn't even focus. You know how the new theater trend that is slowly emerging is autistic-friendly theaters, which are theaters that lack previews, remain a bit lighter during the show, are a tad quieter, and blunt movement and conversation is allowed, even encouraged? That kind of theater experience should've been a standard for Dudley Do-Right during its initial release. To expect an audience to remain silent during this under normal theater conditions is an act of pure torture. The only way I could've remained silent is if I slept.Preceding the film is a short called The Phox, the Box, and the Lox, which involves a conniving Phox tricks a bone-headed Lox into opening a box that states whoever opens this will die to recover the treasure inside.

But in lieu of the plot, John (Poitier) and his white-skin trophy wife-to-be Joey (Houghton) have to recede to a morally-low position, William Rose's script has proffered all the possible (and impossible) approaches to dramatise the situation (a 15 years age difference) and pressure the judgment call should be resolved within the meagre time span (half day at most). Thus, the entire climax is the father of the bride Matt's (Spencer Tracy) decision (it seems a bit racist their black counterpart has little saying in this condition), the professed liberal white man's crucial decision is the game changer seeing that his wife Christina (Hepburn) has capitulated long ago and completely sympathetic, has firmly chosen her side of her mollycoddled daughter. So Matt's ultimate 8-minutes soliloquy (prefaced by a self- affirmation I will be a son of b****) not only has its power of wisdom and appeal to be an excellent showpiece of ethical preaching, a cordial and visceral performance merits standing ovation, but also in the nonfictional life, Tracy's ailing health and his fervid love for Hepburn (out of marriage) are tangible and heart-wrenching, in the coda of his swan song, it reaches a pinnacle by his declaration of love and it is an impeccable curtain call both on and off screen (Tracy died weeks after the filming). However, it is Hepburn, won her third Oscar together with Rose's Best Adapted Screenplay win (out of its overall 10 nominations) while Tracy's posthumous recognition come unstuck. With a borderline leading role among a peerless cast, Hepburn's win might be an overrated adulation, nonetheless it is no slander could smear the performance itself, it is her competency is shortchanged. Houghton, the real niece of Hepburn and a débutante in the film business, tackles with an unsympathetic role out of her naivety, she is reckless and selfish enough to put her parents into such a difficult situation, but it is what the storyline requires, so what left for her to subjectively interpret is very limited. Supporting players are also commendable, Kellaway and Richards are nominated as well (the stereotyped good persons with high moral conscience, admirable and amiable), but Sanford's biased black maid's opinion behooves much more introspection towards the innate frailty of human race, love guides us and love blinds us too.This almost one-apartment cramped family drama even now has its pertinent social reference, which is a sad truth to accept, just wish Tracy and Hepburn will not be disappointed up there in Elysium.

Dante's Peak could have been better but the effects and realistic plot is what made this movie stand out on educational purposes.

Throughout this movie parts were skipped and there wasn't much time to familiarise yourself with the characters and their background lives.If re-making this movie I would change the story line and make it more educational and humorous. For me this movie lacked in humor and they must of found it difficult to disguise what was going to happen as you could clearly tell the volcano was going to erupt with one glance at it releasing its smoke. Dante's Peak could have been better but the effects and realistic plot is what made this movie stand out on educational purposes. For me I believe that this movie is good to show in schools as it lets you see just how villages,towns etc. react when under pressure and close to a major volcanic eruption.

This movie has strengths when coming to the volcanic effects e.g. the pyroclastic cloud and the unique eruption of the volcano. These fiery effects are realistic and believable. The plot of this film was intriguing but also had its downsides. A rewarding part of Dante's Peak was the tension that was gradually progressing throughout the movie. This was just enough to keep the viewer engaged and want to see the ending.Things that let this movie down were, when Pierce Brosnan drove over the flow of lava which just about melted his tyres, but somehow was unable to set the fuel tank on fire.
