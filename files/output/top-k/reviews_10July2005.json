While I thought it was not a bad movie and there were some good parts to it, I did feel that it should have been better. As for what I did like, the acting was good over-all although I would have preferred Dustin Hoffman in the Jack Nicholson part due to his having played Carl Bernstein in ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN (of whom the character was loosely based on). I thought it was interesting how Meryl Streep's character is very happy after she is married and starts her family. Also, the contrast was good in Meryl Streep's reaction when she discovers that Jack Nicholson has been cheating on her. I could see the devastation in her face when she realized that her married life would never be the same again. The scene where Jack Nicholson goes back to New York to get her to reconcile showed how torn she really was about leaving him. I also liked the part where she was telling her friend how she was trying to be happy while making her husband dinner when she was not at all (hence her looking to find evidence of whether he was still cheating on her). Lastly, I liked the final scene where Meryl Streep puts the pie in Jack Nicholson's face while in front of some house guests at the dinner party as it showed the shocking reaction the guests had as well as the fact that Meryl Streep definitely wanted out of the marriage by that point and had had it with Jack Nicholson's fooling around.Now for the negative parts My strongest objection was that the movie just ended without any real conclusion. Granted, it was clear that the two leads were going to get divorced but I actually would have wanted to see them get divorced. The movie would have been stronger if it showed whether or not Meryl Streep's character and Jack Nicholson's character had had any regrets. Also, I think it would have been a better film if it made more use of the secondary characters because as is often the case with divorces in real life, friends and relatives often end up taking sides. I personally think it would have been a more substantial film if it showed whether any of the friends of the main characters ended up taking sides and why. Also, the boss and friend of Meryl Streep's character (Jeff Daniels) seemed to like her a lot. It would have been interesting to see if they ended up together. As for the kids, what would now happen to their lives? I also felt the movie had some gaps that were never answered. In the beginning of the film, Meryl Streep has reservations about ever being married again and she goes as far as to say she does not believe in marriage. Then it's like next thing you know, she is marrying Jack Nicholson despite his reputation as a womanizer. She is even warned about him by his friends on the actual day of the ceremony. Granted, I realize you can't show everything in a movie but why was this not answered? It seemed like a big jump to me. Lastly, I felt there were some scenes like the quasi MASTERPIECE THEATRE bit could have been left out all together. In conclusion, I would say that it is too bad the final product was rendered the way it was since the film had a great deal more potential.

Anyway, my point is, every time, it's like seeing it for the first time. I keep discovering things that I must have noticed before, but don't remember seeing earlier. Tonight, I finally realized why; I'm blocking them out. I'm blocking out almost every single second of this film, and here's why; it reminds me of everything I hate about Denmark and being Danish. Everything strangers automatically associate me with, because I'm Danish. Not only does it remind me of it, the film flaunts it, without ever even considering holding back. The way we drink, how superficial we are, how dependent the typical grown male is of women, how racist and ignorant we are... everything. The film effectively airs our dirty laundry to the audience. On this latest viewing, I actually couldn't stand sitting through(a self-contradiction, I know) more than the first half hour... after which I casually followed the rest whilst sitting at my computer, from where I can see the TV screen... when I bother to stretch, so the computer monitor isn't blocking the view. Needless to say, I didn't catch an awful lot of it this way... but what I got was more than enough to disgust me.

I said what the hell happened here in those 2 hours? Big deal, we learned that they're all weird and someone tried to off himself. Big deal. Royal Tenenbuam wanting to bring the fam together is just a device used to bring these characters back together to place them in this doll house. The scenes are beautifully and meticulously set-up, and maybe this is why nobody ever moves. It's like looking at photographs on the wall come to life - somewhat. Everything seems so random and has no payoff. The characters reactions are bizarre and minimalist. I kept thinking well maybe this is a metaphor for something. Maybe it was supposed relate to a greater, more epic story or something. Richie, with his long hair and beard, at points, looked kind of like Jesus, and his reactions were sort of Jesus-like, (i.e., you're my brother and I love you.), and in fact, he was set up to be the savior of the family...Sort of trying to get everyone to understand Royal's side of things, and vice versa. But that was never actualized (and admittedly, would have been pretty cliché if it had). Alas, we see that Richie feels The Love That Dare Not Speak Its Name for his (adopted) sister, Gwynneth Paltrow. He tries to kill himself (a decidedly un-Jesus thing to do) after learning that his sister is a slut who smokes like a chimney. (Also, did anyone else think that in certain parts, he bears a resemblance to that stupid skit from SNL, The Falconer?) Just Weird. Why? Nobody knows, and after watching the Directors Comments, I don't think there is an answer. The parts with Luke Wilson and Gwyneth, and when Luke attempts suicide, are really the best parts of the movie. It's the closest it comes to any actual emotion. Other than that, everyone and everything seems so oddly detached. It seems so over-edited or something. It almost reminded me of those (I think) Calvin Klein ads in the '80s for Eternity or Obsession, where 2 people would have a totally random conversation while never even looking at each other.

Basically, the substance of this movie is about the same.I thought there must be some meaning beyond this. So I watched the movie AGAIN - with the director's commentary. Wes Anderson just talked about himself and all of the clever ways he came up with this color for the background and how very CLEVER he is and he did this, he did that, all about technical stuff. Sadly, this man suffers from delusions of grandeur, likely because of all of the yes men around him. All he spoke about was how he set up the shot, how he thought of this, he thought of that, etc. The word I was stated more than I have ever heard it said in a 2 hour space of time. Nothing about the characters, really. Nothing to answer the question WHY they do what they do, or what he's trying to say. In fact, more than a few times, he said, I don't know why I decided to do it that way, but it seemed to work. Don't waste your time. Those who attack people who have a less than favorable opinion of this movie as just not getting it or being somehow intellectually challenged, WRONG. To all of those people I must say that if Wes Anderson is the brilliant filmmaker you purport, then the running joke that he's playing is actually on you. This film requires very little intellectual work beyond what you see on the screen. The movie would have been much more satisfying and worthwhile if he actually did give it an actual story, rather than just a contrived set-up tool masquerading as a plot.This director pays a lot of attention to detail. So much so that I think he neglects the big picture - i.e., the story. He misses the forest for all the little the trees. Oh well.That said, I will give this movie a couple of stars for its amazing attention to detail. I just wish one of those details was the plot.

Basically, the substance of this movie is about the same.I thought there must be some meaning beyond this. So I watched the movie AGAIN - with the director's commentary. Wes Anderson just talked about himself and all of the clever ways he came up with this color for the background and how very CLEVER he is and he did this, he did that, all about technical stuff. Sadly, this man suffers from delusions of grandeur, likely because of all of the yes men around him. All he spoke about was how he set up the shot, how he thought of this, he thought of that, etc. The word I was stated more than I have ever heard it said in a 2 hour space of time. Nothing about the characters, really. Nothing to answer the question WHY they do what they do, or what he's trying to say. In fact, more than a few times, he said, I don't know why I decided to do it that way, but it seemed to work. Don't waste your time. Those who attack people who have a less than favorable opinion of this movie as just not getting it or being somehow intellectually challenged, WRONG. To all of those people I must say that if Wes Anderson is the brilliant filmmaker you purport, then the running joke that he's playing is actually on you. This film requires very little intellectual work beyond what you see on the screen. The movie would have been much more satisfying and worthwhile if he actually did give it an actual story, rather than just a contrived set-up tool masquerading as a plot.This director pays a lot of attention to detail. So much so that I think he neglects the big picture - i.e., the story. He misses the forest for all the little the trees. Oh well.That said, I will give this movie a couple of stars for its amazing attention to detail. I just wish one of those details was the plot.

My mom got this movie for me when i was about 12. I saw it the first time and realized that i had friends like that. The movie is definitely one every teenage kid should see. I think it is more of a movie for boys but girls can get out of it the same as the boys can. But the movie overall is great because its just about a four friends who have no experience with the real world. They find out about a dead body and go in search to find it. At first they just do it to be famous and get a reward. But the quest of the boys throughout the movie reveal things that even themselves didn't know about. After it all, the boys find out about reality, and how it isn't glamorous. They realize that the body could of been them and they respect that. In my opinion the point of the movie was not to have you think of when you were 12 and your good friends but to think of what you have now, and what you do with it. In the end Gordie tells us what happens to each and how each kind of go their separate ways. (Such as the last scene of the movie). This is definitely a movie to not only rent but buy.

I also know many fans will stand up and immediately protest that statement. Me? Well, I think it is true. Newsies is without a doubt a cheesy Disney musical. However, who's to say that is necessarily a bad thing? Let's face it; we all need a bit of cheesiness every now and then.Is this a deep, thought-provoking movie? No.Is this a side-splitting comedy which will have you catching your breathe? No.Is this movie worth your while? I'd say yes.You see, Newsies is a wonderful display of how even children\/teens can change the world. We see how the word family doesn't just mean blood-relatives, but all the people who care about you and protect you. The movie's cast, lead by Christian Bale, is a strong group of performers, many of whom sing, dance, and act. The music is your traditional Disney score, yet also different. I can assure at least King of New York will have you tapping your toe and bobbing your head.That isn't to say the film is without its faults. While the opening credits claim it is based on actual events, the term loosely comes to mind. Yes, there was a newsboy strike in 1899, but Disney did embellish a bit. While many of the supporting characters (i.e. Kid Blink, Racetrack Higgins, etc) were part of the real strike, the protagonist, Jack Kelly, was a made-up character. Also, the strike did not have the same outcome as the film. The newsboys did not get the price of the papers lowered as in the movie. What they did get was the ability to sell back unsold papers for a full refund.In addition, Disney tries to force a love story into the plot with the character of Sarah Jacobs (Jack's love interest). I am grateful that the film continues to center itself around the strike and doesn't use an historical event as a place to insert a love story (as is done in Titanic and Pearl Harbor), but the side plot still proves to be a bit awkward and sudden, not to mention Sarah is an uninteresting, one-dimensional character who serves no other purpose other than the hero's love interest.Despite these few flaws, Newsies is a wonderful, albeit cheesy, musical which is sure to amuse the entire family.

Perhaps too much, because I was very disappointed with it. It reminded me of an earlier disappointment - the Street Fighter live action movie, but worse. A lot, lot worse.The movie is filled with obvious, and bad CG (the dragon\/hydra battle in the end, what the ---- was that animated with? Amiga?), the plot is shaky at best and 90% of the cast have been swapped for actors (and I use this term rather loosely) with even less talent than the original ones. I think the only originals are Robin Shou (Liu Kang) and Talisa Soto (Kitana); mainly because they were pretty much the only ones whose career did NOT pick up in some way after MK. Now, while losing Bridgette Wilson and Linden Ashby might not have been a very great loss, losing Christopher Lambert was. He was replaced by James Remar, who, while a decent enough actor, does not possess Lambert's sheer charisma that made Rayden so likable in MK1. Now he's just a wig-wielding, buffed up replacement, and that's exactly what he feels like a replacement, though to be honest, I didn't pay much attention to his acting or fight scenes, I was too distracted by the gap between his front teeth. This pretty much sums up the entertainment value of the movie - there is none. It's just bad. Not funny bad. Not so bad it's good. Just... bad.The plot in a nutshell the evil Emperor, Shao-Kahn (Brian Thompson, who is best known for playing the alien bounty hunter in X-Files), Lord Rayden's brother (um, what?), is invading the world with his extermination squads (which consist mainly of stumbling ninjas no one can apparently stop - guns\/armies don't exist in the MK realm?) and only a handful of people (Liu Kang (the ultimate Gary Stu - Robin Shou), Lieutenant Sonya Blade (Sandra Hess), Lord Rayden (James Remar), Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto) and famous actor Johnny Cage (I have no idea who plays him)) can stop it. Too bad Johnny dies about two seconds into the movie, Kitana is kidnapped by the surprisingly whole Scorpion (who was pretty much blown to bits in the last part) and Sonya's foul attitude is almost a disability, but fret not! The group is joined by Jaxx, Sonya's partner, who, as far as we know, was in Hong Kong a day earlier (MK2 takes place immediately after MK1), worked as a cop and had no metal arms. Now, he's some military honcho and *has* metal arms. Ah, well. We also meet Jade (supermodel Irina Pantaeva, the only big name in MK2), who betrays the group by luring them to the Outworld to save Queen Sindel, Kitana's mother, whose mother's love (*gag*), according to legend, can close the portals that spew the stumbling ninjas to Earth and overthrow Shao-Kahn for good. Too bad the legend was a lie (um, what? And since when WAS Sindel Kitana's mother anyway?) and the whole thing was just a heinous plot to trap the goody-two-shoes group in Outworld. Amidst this all, Rayden is made mortal to protect mankind, he cuts his hair, Sindel shrieks and destroys an entire ancient temple in the process, Sonya rolls around in mud with Mileena, and Jaxx makes a pass at Jade. Um, OK. But, in the end, there's a big battle and the good guys win, and we find out pretty much everyone is related (we know this because Rayden mentions a family crest tattooed into each family member - save for Mileena, whose tattoo was basically fake (it flew out of her after she died in a fight with Sonya) so she was NOT a member of Rayden's family. Um, Kitana IS Mileena's sister, hence she WOULD be Sindel's daughter, hence she WOULD be family - where are you going with this, Mr. Writer?) and everyone lives happily ever after - complete with a shot of Jaxx, Sonya, Liu, Kitana and Sindel walking on green pastures, pretty much hand-in-hand, smiling brightly. I'm sure they're just happy they got to leave Gaptooth behind. No, really, that's basically the plot. We also meet Sheeva, Baraka (who resembles a bulldog), Motaro, Smoke, and Sub-Zero's little brother, Sub-Zero. Wow, what imaginative parents they must have. We also get a mention of the police officer from MK3, Stryker, and another MK3 character Kabal.The soundtrack is your standard issue action flick variety; Scooter, Prodigy, the lot. At times, it works, and at times, it doesn't. Sometimes the music isn't quite in rhythm with the scene, the best example of this is the royal rumble before the final battle between Liu Kang and Shao-Kahn. But in other scenes, like when Scooter's Fire plays during the battle between Liu Kang and Shao-Kahn's assassin (I forgot which one), the music works - the timing is perfect and the flow of the song goes with the flow of the scene.

The action is taking places in the mids of aristocratic society yet everyone from the emperor to the opera director and to the servants behave like 21st century below-average income American citizens. The German (or Austrian) culture is fully ignored giving way to the american style (as it appears to common individual, not as it is in real life).The actions the characters take, as well as the results of those actions, are totally unwarranted. No reason is given as to way the character would act in the manner described or why their actions would yield the shown effect. This is deliberately so that it allows for desire gratification. This is taking a wish out of real-life (son-father relationships is the mill for most such wishes in this movie), setting up a scene that will make one recognize his (perhaps frustrated) desire in it, and then, contrary to what would've happened in real-life and by doing so destroying character consistency, gratify it (with the proper evolution in the plot). This technique is also used for social manipulation in forming a distorted view of reality.

Like no one really expects the people playing ballet on the scene truly be ballet-players. But they SHOULD move in at least a decent amount of sync. And when the piano is played, again, some correlation between the melody and the motion of the hands over the keys is expected.That being said, this is perhaps one of the best movies for its purposes. The story is told trough the eyes of the mediocre court-composer Antonio Salieri. The troubles of the characters are the troubles of the average individual of the 21st century (like bad credit, alcohol, bureaucracy, father, mother-in-law, etc.). What disappoints me about the movie is that these issues are not treated from a higher-perspective like one would expect but instead they are settled within the scope and understanding of the average individual.

Is is mediocre to say least. One would expect more out of a movie called Amadeus. The correlation with Mozart is totally out of place. There is nothing in this movie about nobility, greatness, extraordinary people or anything else among the lines of higher understanding or one self's quest for betterness.The characters behave totally out of place. The action is taking places in the mids of aristocratic society yet everyone from the emperor to the opera director and to the servants behave like 21st century below-average income American citizens. The German (or Austrian) culture is fully ignored giving way to the american style (as it appears to common individual, not as it is in real life).The actions the characters take, as well as the results of those actions, are totally unwarranted. No reason is given as to way the character would act in the manner described or why their actions would yield the shown effect. This is deliberately so that it allows for desire gratification. This is taking a wish out of real-life (son-father relationships is the mill for most such wishes in this movie), setting up a scene that will make one recognize his (perhaps frustrated) desire in it, and then, contrary to what would've happened in real-life and by doing so destroying character consistency, gratify it (with the proper evolution in the plot). This technique is also used for social manipulation in forming a distorted view of reality.

During some of the skits that litter the show, they are at the top of their game. It is during others, when they seem to believe that just repeating the kind of material that worked in the previous two films will get laughs, that the opposite happens. Given that the next film to feature the Mexican stoners was Things Are Tough All Over, this can be described as the last genuinely funny Cheech and Chong film. People seem to believe that the duo lost their box office draw as the result of the Just Say No culture, and that might be true in a sort of coincidental manner. But the sad truth is that this comedy based around two hapless, jobless losers getting stoned and having a lot of misadventures got old very quickly. Next Movie and Up In Smoke were also basically a couple of funny skits with a lot of ordinary film linking them together, but Nice Dreams shows these occasional skits getting progressively less amusing.The conceit of Nice Dreams is simple. Cheech and Chong play a pair of stoners who run a beachside marijuana plantation. An undercover operation to catch them in the act of selling their produce turns up evidence that some of the marijuana they grow is somehow capable of turning the smoker into something reptilian. Unfortunately, this subplot is barely set up, and never exploited to anything resembling its full potential. All we get is a few interesting shots of Stacy Keach turning into a man-sized lizard. If you have seen Up In Smoke, then you have no reason to watch any part of this film that Keach appears in. His character, dialogue, and routines are almost word for word lifted from Up In Smoke. During a large part of the film, he is utterly absent from proceedings as the heroes go off on all sorts of other whacky adventures.One such detour involves a trip to a mental hospital where the doctor seems whackier than the patients. This gives Paul Reubens a chance to do his thing as the Howie Hamburger Dude, a slightly less orthodox role than as the hotel clerk in Next Movie. It is kind of strange that he appears childlike next to Cheech Marin, who is nearly half a foot shorter than him. Fans of Bad Santa might also recognise Tony Cox, although you would need to be more attentive than your average goof-spotter to notice him at any point. Evelyn Guerrero makes the second of three appearances as Donna, who is at the centre of one rather odd skit involving a naked Cheech riding atop an elevator car. Fans of the stoner duo may in fact see more of Cheech than they had wished during this part of the film. If that is not dedication to their art, then I do not know what is. There is also a mildly amusing Jimi Hendrix skit for those who did not get enough of this schtick in Police Academy 6.Ultimately, the big problem with this, or any other Cheech and Chong film save Up In Smoke, is a lack of plot cohesion. It is almost as if the writers think to themselves hey, this tack is no longer working, let's start a whole new film now. What basically saves this film is that when they do switch to a new tack, the one they switch to happens to work, at least for the first ten minutes thereof. This is a complete contrast to Still Smokin', where you have one skit that is good for about four laughs in amongst eighty minutes of complete crap. Perhaps if Cheech and Chong teamed up with some genuinely talented comic writers like Simon Pegg, they could come up with something that involves laughter from beginning to finish. They could even team up with George Romero and produce a stoner zombie film, which is something I would certainly pay to see.In the end, however, this is little more than the fodder that helped the idea of Hollywood needing less studios take hold. Sure, we have less unfunny comedies these days, but we also have less genuinely funny ones. So I gave Nice Dreams a five out of ten.

Still though, it is still a fun movie to watch. Unlike the sequel which rushes us through the story, this one takes a bit more time developing the characters even though it is only about ten minutes longer. Both Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are very good and funny, especially Smith because he is the new guy so he is seeing all the weird aliens and such for the first time. This is also something missing from the sequel. In the end though the reason I probably like this one so much is that it sort of reminds me of a Ghostbuster movie, and seeing as how we will most likely never see another sequel to that movie it is nice to see a movie sort of like it in that they are keeping tabs and hunting aliens rather than ghosts. The pug dog scene is funny, and the dog is not over used as in the sequel, and there is also a funny scene where Will Smith must deliver an alien baby...their main objective in this one is to track down an alien insect that has hijacked the skin of a guy and is trying to find a universe. If he succeeds the Earth is destroyed, of course Tommy Lee's character is so calm about the whole situation that you feel you have nothing to worry about.

The middle of the film is actually somewhat engaging, there are scenes where odd flashes of competence shine through, and the beginning of the climax, at least, is pretty suspenseful, even though it peters out when it should be reaching a fevered pitch. Even with the plethora of problems, The Lawnmower Man is worth watching for fans of so bad it's good films (even though this isn't exactly so bad that it's good), just to witness the atrocious special effects (almost all CGI) and the bizarre concatenation of elements that it's almost impossible to imagine anyone thought would be a good idea if they weren't intentionally shooting for a comedy or an absurdist genre film. Yes, director\/writer Brett Leonard, co-writer Gimel Everett and the production team were serious, and thought that they were producing a cutting-edge, hip and thrilling genre film--something like the Matrix of its time. That alone is funny enough once you've seen a few minutes of the film to make this worth a watch.The story has two protagonists, one of which eventually becomes something of an anti-hero. The film begins with a text prediction about just how prevalent and influential virtual reality will be at the turn of the 21st Century. In retrospect, it underscores just how ridiculously inflated revolutionary or savior technology predictions tend to be. We then meet Dr. Lawrence Angelo (Pierce Brosnan before he was in a position to turn down starring roles), who is engaged in virtual reality research for the government (his superiors call their project\/division The Shop). He's experimenting on monkeys, and per his superior's orders, the focus is on military uses--the monkey is being virtual reality trained in battle strategy while they're manipulating its aggression levels. As anyone who has seen at least two or three genre films could guess, this ends up backfiring. The monkey freaks out and runs rampant through the secret government facility, attacking employees.Dr. Angelo semi-voluntarily goes on hiatus. He had wanted to eventually test human subjects for susceptibility to his virtual reality mind expansion, without the emphasis on violence, but that seems a lost cause. However, after his wife leaves him, he decides that maybe he can do the research on his own. He decides that the perfect test subject is the titular lawnmower man--his neighbor Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey). Jobe happens to be developmentally disabled. Of course, things do not go exactly as planned with the tests on Jobe, either, especially once The Shop gets wind of what Dr. Angelo is doing.The Lawnmower Man grew out of a Stephen King short story that most famously appeared in his Night Shift collection. The King story is only a few pages long, and it bears almost no resemblance to the film. The only scene that's at all similar is the one involving a lawn mower and Peter Parkette's (Austin O'Brien) father. It might be informative for those who have a less than consistently favorable opinion of King-oriented films to note that King sued to have any reference to his name removed. I actually like most King-oriented films, but I find the suit amusing, too.What makes The Lawnmower Man such a trainwreck? The most prominent problem, because it is such a focus of the film, is the CGI. When Dr. Angelo is working with human subjects in The Shop's facilities, they wear spiffy spandex suits reminiscent of Tron (1982). That may be enough of a problem in itself (and just who made those suits if Dr. Angelo had never been authorized to work with humans?), but the bigger problem is that the CGI is also reminiscent of Tron. That's not to say that Tron isn't successful, but it had very primitive CGI. There, it was more excusable for three reasons. One, it was made in the late 1970s\/early 1980s, when CGI _had_ to be much more primitive. Two, realizing this, Tron director Steven Lisberger aimed at creating more of a minimalist world. And three, once introduced to us, most of Tron took place in that world.By the early 1990s, computer graphics had progressed quite a bit. Yet, Leonard allows The Lawnmower Man's CGI sequences to almost exclusively consist of brightly colored, low-resolution, simple geometric shapes floating around in a featureless world. Admittedly, The Lawnmower Man was a bit low-budgeted. But I'm not sure that excuses computer graphics that look like they were done on a Commodore 64 by someone working through a basic pixel animation book. And this stuff is supposed to accelerate the evolution of the human mind? It wouldn't matter so much if this were not the crux of the film. But the CGI is as important here as the scenes inside The Matrix are to that film. The effects work a bit better when they're integrated with cinematography. But Leonard avoids that more than he should.And the CGI isn't the only problem. The story otherwise is extremely awkward. Most of it is unintentionally absurdist. Jobe lives in a little shack in an otherwise normal suburban neighborhood. A sadistic priest regularly flogs him. A beautiful widow seduces him. Peter's family is almost a spoof of the typical King family, with an abusive, alcoholic father. All of these people bizarrely live right next door to Dr. Angelo. I could go on and on, but there isn't room.Still, there are aspects of the story that work. When Leonard finally gets around to death scenes, they're pretty good. The suspense stuff when Dr. Angelo is in Washington is good. And the overall arc about Jobe transforming, but getting out of control and seeking revenge is enjoyable, pithy and certainly a classic, archetypal plot. But this isn't anything if it's not a mixed bag. Watch expecting a trainwreck, and you should be entertained for an evening.

Joe Johnston does a really good job though. It's obviously going to have a different approach to the material because of this, but ultimately it works quite well.Admittedly, it's a significantly different kind of film. It's extremely fast paced and by this I mean you have the cast already on the island and being pursued by the main dinosaur on the JP3 logo within the first 15 minutes! There are some things that seem unanswered in the film but overall I feel these things can be looked over. Also the sprinkled attempts at humor had me laughing but at the same time had me raising my eyebrows because it felt slightly out of place in the world of Jurassic Park.The film is a lot shorter. It's about an hour an a half as opposed to the other films being over two hours long. So overall as you can see, it's quite a bit different from the other two. But this is a Joe Johnston film, not a Steven Spielberg film and I feel the director shouldn't try to totally duplicate what was done before him and that he needs to make his own movie. Just so long as he doesn't change things around so drastically that it is no longer the same. Thankfully Johnston still captures that old adventurous Jurassic Park feeling and provides highly memorable and breathtaking action sequences. Sam Neill, who is one of my favorite actors, is back and reprises his role as Dr. Grant and it's really great to see him back in the hat! While the plot may be very simplistic the film does enrich the world of Jurassic Park. Obviously Ingen is still up to no good and creating dinosaurs that weren't originally 'on the list' as was stated. Here we have the addition of the Spinosaurus, Ankylosaurus, and various other dinos.The music by Don Davis is superb. He integrates the memorable themes by John Williams and uses them superbly in his own original music.The special effects by ILM are terrific as ever. Some of my favorite big moments being the confrontation between the T-Rex and Spinosaurus, The Bird Cage sequence (especially the build up to where the Pterondon is walking on the bridge) and the Brachiosaurus greeting the boat.

It is the best film ever made.Then, there was The Neverending Story II. I'll vent my spleen over that mess later.And then, there came this waste of film and effort. Hold on a minute while I go throw up.While it is a clean, safe film in terms of subject matter, the third NES should never have been made. And I mean NEVER. The first two movies covered all the wondrous things within the original book, so I don't understand why this film was made at all. It is just cheesy, stupid, abysmal, and an absolute disgrace to the idea of The Neverending Story.First of all, what's going on with this stepsister of Bastian's that has somehow appeared? Wrong, wrong. . . Then, what happened to good old Falkor? And most of all, where is Atreyu? If you are bold enough to see this film, that is the one thing you will distinctly notice if you've seen the other two- no Atreyu.The boy who played Bastian was not nearly as obnoxious as the actor from the second film, but he just doesn't hold a candle to the original actor, Barret Oliver. I have only seen this movie once, because I was informed of how awful it was, and just had to see for myself. It was a waste of my precious time. I hardly remember the plot line or anything important like that because it just didn't stick with me. One gets the impression that this was made as a sort of kid\/family-friendly approach to The Neverending Story, because it is just so simplistic, and sacrifices the charm of the original characters and settings for the sake of being funny and entertaining. But trust me, it is NOT funny and it is NOT entertaining. Any NES fan worth their salt would be appalled by this film. If however you are not familiar with the Neverending Story, see the original 1984 movie and read the book and be contented with that. Do not subject yourself to the torturous nightmare that is the Neverending Story 3, I implore you. As for a star rating out of ten, I give this film nothing. Nil. Zip. Nichts.

Hold on a minute while I go throw up.While it is a clean, safe film in terms of subject matter, the third NES should never have been made. And I mean NEVER. The first two movies covered all the wondrous things within the original book, so I don't understand why this film was made at all. It is just cheesy, stupid, abysmal, and an absolute disgrace to the idea of The Neverending Story.First of all, what's going on with this stepsister of Bastian's that has somehow appeared? Wrong, wrong. . . Then, what happened to good old Falkor? And most of all, where is Atreyu? If you are bold enough to see this film, that is the one thing you will distinctly notice if you've seen the other two- no Atreyu.The boy who played Bastian was not nearly as obnoxious as the actor from the second film, but he just doesn't hold a candle to the original actor, Barret Oliver. I have only seen this movie once, because I was informed of how awful it was, and just had to see for myself. It was a waste of my precious time.

When I rented this flick with my buddie we expected a total low budget scifi movie. In Sweden the title is Enemy of the earth. Listen to it? It sounds horribly lame. But we came home, put it on and I'm not sure about my friend but I liked it more and more the more I watched it. The basics of the story is quite simple and but yet they have managed to make the story realistic and...well it totally got me caught. Up until the end the movie might have been a 5\/10 or so, but the ending is absolutely beautiful. I haven't seen a great ending like this for quite some time. You never see it coming really, you believe you can predict how the movies going to end but you will never guess right, take my word for it. Now, putting the simple, acting, effects, story and so on aside. This movie really gets you thinking about the philosophic perspective of the self and what makes our bodies and souls unique. I recommend this movie. ","genre":null},{"date":"10 July 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie took me by complete surprise.

It has its high points, but to many low as well. The story of a really annoying prince turned king who is evil and the knight who blames the evil portion of him on a dragon that gave part of his heart to save him is just not all that good. The highlight of this movie comes in the form of the fight between the knight and dragon and their subsequent teaming to help the dragon slayer make a little money. Then the movie goes south again as the dragon is captured and we have just a typical movie without the title character the dragon which makes for a very anti-climatic last portion of the film that ended about how you would expect it to. The effects are okay, not quite on par with a movie such as Jurassic Park, but the dragon looks real enough. I am guessing they tried to keep him out of the movie as much as possible to keep the costs down, unfortunately this hinders the film and it is not as good as it could have been. Still it is worth a look.

I have had it on DVD for years, but I'll never forget seeing it when it first came out in the early 1980s. It scared the bejeezus out of me, and to this day after multiple viewings is still chilling (pun intended).I've never been as huge of a fan of John Carpenter as a lot of folks are... I do admire his originality on many films and he is a master at creating an atmosphere of suspense, but this is absolutely his Citizen Kane.You all know the premise, but one area that I really enjoy is the solid character acting. All of the actors (with the exception of Kurt Russell, and he's never done anything better than this) are generally well-regarded and very experienced character actors (many primarily from TV), and they are very believable and just do incredibly professional yeoman-like work. I particularly enjoy Wilford Brimley as the scientist Blair.Also as others as pointed out the HP Lovecraft influences are there, and I feel that perhaps more than any other film captures his style of slow realization of impending doom and otherworldly horror.A rare 10 in my book, and is absolutely a must see.
