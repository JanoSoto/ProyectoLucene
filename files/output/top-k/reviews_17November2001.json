There was not one good man in this movie.  I can't think of one movie with good male characters and all the women are jerks (unless they are also movies about heroism or power in an abstract way).  So I don't understand those who claim this to be a role reversal.  If there IS a movie with good male characters, and all the females are rotten or witchy, I would have a big problem with that too.  The Man Show is one of my least favorite TV shows on this planet.This whole I am woman, hear me roar doesn't make sense.  Could I say something along the lines of I am man, hear me roar.  Women are equal to men so why is it they need to convince themselves threw statements of power? Companies use this to sell products...

Not because it's a craze right now or because everyone else is reading it, but because I read the books and have grown a love for them, for the amazing story lines and intricate plot points. And the characters are all three dimensional and well written, and you can't help but feel for them. JK Rowling has put a lot of time and planning into this little baby of hers, and it shows.Hence, I've been waiting for this movie to come out ever since I first heard about it. I have avoided movie reviews and all other such nonsense as much as possible so I could have my own unbiased opinion of a movie that is based on books I love so much.Well, one of my favorite parts was the Monster's Inc trailer directly before it. This Trailer alone is worth the price of admission! But enough of that, on to the movie.Well, Being the enormous Potter fan that I am, my main concern was for it to stay true to the books. So I will start with the good things about the movie first.All of the characters were perfectly cast. The girl who played Hermione was exactly how I pictured her to be, and did a dead on performance. The special effects were amazing, and I have become especially impressed with how far technology has come in the last few years. The story line also contained most of the key events in the novel and was almost entirely true to it. It is one of the best film adaptations to a book I have ever seen, and I must say that I did enjoy it.However, I must admit that this movie has its weaknesses. And it is not the fault of the movie, its director, or its actors. The fault in the movie lies in the fact that it is based on a book that has a very large and loyal fan base, many of which have read this book more then once, and know it cover to cover.This movie clocked in at nearly 2 and a half hours and it still seemed entirely too short. The book is so complex, in that it and all the books following are all interconnected, and there is fore shadowing in every one. All of these events seem important, whether in character development or in relation to the current or future plots. There are so many secondary characters in this book that they aren't given nearly enough screen time. (the Dursley's for instance, one small example.  Fred and George Weasley, another. These two are a couple of my favorite characters and we didn't see nearly enough of them!)

We've all seen it (if not here's a hammer to hit yourself with) and loved it. Now I've read the anti-Star Wars comments here and feel as though I should respond with a fair point of view rather than gush about the movie itself (been done already).First off,this movie is not a western. Yes it's got a western type story to it,but it obviously is not one. I would aim more toward it being a cross between sci-fi with western underpinnings which is why it wasn't so hokey like most previous sci-fi (hence,a big reason why this movie made such a splash). Calling it uninteresting is just plain bluster considering what was valued as 'good' sci-fi at the time. As for the Storm Trooper's not being able to shoot....what else is new? Every action movie I've ever seen with firefight scene in it has the bad guys blind as bats. Remember;it's fantasy!The decline of Hollywood certainly didn't start with Star Wars. I'm sure we could all discuss this one for a very long time,but I assure you,Lucas isn't to blame for Hollywood's recent poor flicks. Paranoia at it's best! Praising Jaws above Star Wars? Well,everyone's got a right to an opinion however Jaws is nothing more than a simple monster movie such as Godzilla. )Boring? I guess you 'could' say that,but I'd have to say you didn't really pay attention to the story and are the type who must have a fight scene every 3 minutes to keep you entertained. Sort of like the kid who rushes past the intro to a video game so you can hit buttons as fast as possible.The below posting,'Episode IV Leia Rules, Star Wars sucks' is so ridiculous it doesn't deserve response. I'll hazard a guess and say that anyone with this much hate in their words is the type of person who simply hates a movie (or song) simply because so many others like it.I quote'The films shortcomings in terms of the technology, detail and positioning, whilst revolutionary for its time, must be examined compared to today's standards for the movie to be considered great.' Answer No,it doesn't. I have a friend who thinks because a movie has some years on it,that it somehow makes the film no longer good. This is ridiculous. Film is art,just like music and paint. When they're good,you judge them on their own merit and not contrasted against other works. If it's good,it's good. The film's effects were certainly not poorly done and you've got to remember when the film was created.  I was four years old when I saw this and was certainly not confused about the plot. The movie is a visual adventure in the sense that although the dialogue and plot was great,even if you missed something,you'd be able to pick it up with the visuals that give you the story anyway. Anyone who gets lost in the story should stick to pro wrestling. As for the 'laws of physics sound travelling through space' argumentI've heard this one several times taken up against ALL sci-fi films. What exactly would these viewers have us listen to? NOTHING?

I was very excited about this film, and do not know when I have been so disappointed.  It was so syrupy and sentimental, so blindingly unsubtle that I felt like I was counting down the minutes, waiting for the main character to die.To return to my assertion that everyone involved gave this film their best effort, let me begin by commenting on the performances.  Kevin Kline and Hayden Christensen attempted honest, heart-wrenching performances, and I commend them for this.  Unfortunately, the dialogue was such debilitating tripe, that they could only do so much with it.  Everything that every character said seemed like the subtext that should motivate a line, not be the line itself.  How can anyone take lines like, I've been using since I was twelve!  or I wanted to make you love me.  Well it worked! seriously?  An audience member can only be expected to swallow so much overblown sentimentality... is natural-sounding, subtle dialogue so much to ask?A similar level of laying it on thick can be found in the cinematography. A few shots of the sun setting behind the ocean with symphonic music swelling is nice, one every five minutes is painful.And finally, I have some issues with even something as basic as the plot. It felt as though there was two disparate stories shoved into the same ninety minutes.  One was the story of Kevin Kline learning that he is dying and making a last ditch effort to bond with his wayward son.  Fine, this was the movie I payed ten dollars to see.  But there was also a story about sexual deviance and lust that felt woefully out of place.  Typically, I would be more drawn to the sexual deviance plot than the father\/son reunion plot, but not both at the same time.  Sex is rampant between the characters, nudity misplaced, and the whole sexual theme only feels awkward and tacked on.Basically, I thought this movie was monstrous; certainly, it was one of the worst films I have ever seen.  Unfortunately, it is only so bad because it had the potential to be so good.  With fine actors and a fine cinematographer on hand, I guess I choose to blame the writers for this abomination.  In this movie, we learn that all it takes for a rebel to become a good, clean cut kid is to stop dying your hair and to take out your piercings.  I don't think there is so easy a solution for saving this wayward film.

Unfortunately, it is only so bad because it had the potential to be so good.  With fine actors and a fine cinematographer on hand, I guess I choose to blame the writers for this abomination.  In this movie, we learn that all it takes for a rebel to become a good, clean cut kid is to stop dying your hair and to take out your piercings.  I don't think there is so easy a solution for saving this wayward film.

I saw it at the Boston Film Festival where Kevin Kline and the director were supposed to be present, but mercifully could not attend.  I was very excited about this film, and do not know when I have been so disappointed.  It was so syrupy and sentimental, so blindingly unsubtle that I felt like I was counting down the minutes, waiting for the main character to die.To return to my assertion that everyone involved gave this film their best effort, let me begin by commenting on the performances.  Kevin Kline and Hayden Christensen attempted honest, heart-wrenching performances, and I commend them for this.  Unfortunately, the dialogue was such debilitating tripe, that they could only do so much with it.  Everything that every character said seemed like the subtext that should motivate a line, not be the line itself.  How can anyone take lines like, I've been using since I was twelve!  or I wanted to make you love me.  Well it worked! seriously?  An audience member can only be expected to swallow so much overblown sentimentality... is natural-sounding, subtle dialogue so much to ask?A similar level of laying it on thick can be found in the cinematography. A few shots of the sun setting behind the ocean with symphonic music swelling is nice, one every five minutes is painful.And finally, I have some issues with even something as basic as the plot. It felt as though there was two disparate stories shoved into the same ninety minutes.  One was the story of Kevin Kline learning that he is dying and making a last ditch effort to bond with his wayward son.  Fine, this was the movie I payed ten dollars to see.  But there was also a story about sexual deviance and lust that felt woefully out of place.  Typically, I would be more drawn to the sexual deviance plot than the father\/son reunion plot, but not both at the same time.  Sex is rampant between the characters, nudity misplaced, and the whole sexual theme only feels awkward and tacked on.Basically, I thought this movie was monstrous; certainly, it was one of the worst films I have ever seen.

I was enamored by the visual effects.  This time around, I'm 22, and have an electronics background, so I understand some of the concepts a little more.  It really isn't a bad movie, it speculates what the world will become in 2001, which is obviously a little innaccurate, considering it's almost 2002, but still.  The concept is completely science fiction, and, for all we know, could be a sign of things to come.  Maybe not now, but in the future.  It won't be as obvious as a mainframe with open I\/O ports letting a purely electronic being out into the world's data networks, but it could be a precursor to some AI developments.  In 50 years, people may think this movie was worthless, or they could think that it was a vision into the future.Either way, the movie makes you think, and that is more than can be said for a lot of movies (i.e. Dude Where's My Car).

So I thought that I most as well read the first one and see what all the fuss was all about.I officially became addicted after the first page and every single book after that was no different as they were all fun and exciting.So from then on I had the 16th November marked down on my calendar and was really hoping that Chris Columbus was not going to ruin the book. I know he was a good directer because I've liked films like Home Alone but there was always that evil shadow called Bicentanial Man lurking other me.So at 7.00 on the 16th November I went into the cinema and the film started and it was completely amazing, of cause there were some scenes taken out like the rescueing of the Dragon and that song by the Sorting hat but who cares because what they did put in was brilliant. Especially the Quidditch match they completely shooked me because nothing could of prepared me for such brilliant effects, but I wish they did more then one match as they did in the book.All the characters were played well like harry potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson)but my favourite has to Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), but one thing that was pretty enoring was that Neville Longbottom character was not used much. All the other big actors in this film like Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith were all great as well and so on the acting front it was great also.So all together a great film with a well spend budget that will blow you away and completely faithful to the book.
