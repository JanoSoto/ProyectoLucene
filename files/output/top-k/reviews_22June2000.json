Nightwatch is a remake of this film in almost any sense of the word. Much like the recent Psycho-remake, the director simply tried to recreate his original film. In this perspective, McGregor was very well casted, because he looks a lot like the original Norwegian actor who played the role of Martin. A lot of scenes in the movie I might say almost all of them!) are exact copies of scenes in the original movie. It's almost scary, sometimes it even looks like they used the sets and props all over again. (Joyce's apartment, the 'bathtub room', Martin's little office, etc) This goes very much into every detail. The mysterious photograph in martin's office is THE SAME as in the original film. (Rumour goes it's an early picture of the director himself). Little things like that are all through this remake (the moths in the lamp, the flickering light in the hallway).So did the crew succeed in making an exact copy of the original film? NO WAY! It might look the same, but this version lacks any form of tension. Everything that works so well in the original film just seems silly or stupid in this version. I still can't put my finger on it...I don't know what it is, it just doesn't work!Even though the movies have more than one thing in common, there are also a lot of differences. For instance, the sick little game going on between Martin and his best friend isn't really worked into Nightwatch well. In Nattevagten, this goes much further.

In Nightwatch, the two bullies are a black guy and a latino. In the original film however, both guys are WHITE! What's up with that???). Nattevagten ends with a real funny epilogue like wedding scene, totally cut out of Nightwatch.Watching Nightwatch after you've seen Nattevagten is like watching your local high school's drama club perform Shakespeare. Sure, the words are right, the actors look the way they should, but it just doesn't work the way it was supposed to be. If you haven't seen Nightwatch, do yourself a favour go rent the original movie Nattevagten!!! Sure, the weird Norwegian language takes a little getting used to, but you'll get into it eventually.

Sorry Busta, I like your music, but your acting leaves a lot to be desired.There is a lot more action in the new Shaft, but it feels unnecessary at times (never though I'd complain about too much action). And I thought Shaft was a sex machine with the chicks. What gives? It's my duty to please that booty. That's it? Is that all we get? Part of the reason that we want to be Shaft is that he's just so smooth with the ladies, but I think Roundtree as his uncle probably saw more action in this movie. Roundtree still looks good, by the way. Forget that politically correct nonsense, in the sequel I want to see Shaft get tail and plenty of it. If you're not going to do it right, then don't do it at all.Other than that, I was entertained. I wasn't sure what to expect coming in, but I walked out very satisfied. There are a lot of really neat characters roaming through this movie, and it's a lot of fun keeping track of them all as they run into each other. 8\/10 stars easy. G'night!

For you anime fans is 3x3 eyes the anime about a chick with three eyes. For you complaining Trekies there is the Borg. Would you name a bunch of cyborgs The Borg?  It seems everyone has something to chip away at this movie, Namely lack of creativity. How many times has a space ship exploded or someone been sucked out into space? Tired of it? No, because it's still cool. Where would movies be if you took away all the things you know and expect. We might have another Mission Impossible.  I don't think I am the only one who that movie confused.Movies need certain things. And in America it's a good guy, a bad guy, a comic relief, and some silly unrealistic violence. Bluth did a rather good job of breaking some of the Disney created requirements. We still got comic relief, good and bad guys and so on but at least this time around we got some blood and realistic violence with consequences. My god, if you break someone's neck they die...Gasp, Disney was wrong.I think that the best combination of animation would be between anime and American animation. I have problems with people who lean heavily to one particular side. Though typically more action packed  anime has its flaws. Such as everyone has about thirty gallons of blood that is under high pressure, dang near every city can be destroyed by some big evil guy that the hero inevitably fights and one or both are killed, every person has some rare illness that causes their eyeballs to swell to ungodly proportions. How do you even blink grapefruit eyes? There's also the soap opera plots, big breasted girls who are always too weak to do anything, the punks that become heroes, bad mix of future and present, the much loved elders, giant power suits, laser weapons, bad portrayals of Americans (were all surfer dude cowboys), repeated animation (look there goes his car, look its his car again, look its the same six cars in a four frame loop),  sound effects for every action,  sun with glinting sound off of every shinny object , unoriginal plots (crap they have guns, lets infiltrate and destroy something vital), mouths that can shift shape to cover 90% of the face, ect, ect. Don't get me wrong I love anime, but it's just as flawed as ours.Anime one side of a coin and ours the other. ours has its problems, namely it's plain, has  kiddy plots,  the annoying habit of being made by Disney and usually gives teens a great deal of shame when they have to watch. Animation could benefit greatly from having films with both influences. The surrealism of Japan and the realism of America. Titan A.E. is a start in that direction. Some voices weren't hot and the movie lacked the violent power of some anime but it's a start.I think that Bluth made a valiant effort to break the cliche. People who are aggravated with our animation should give him slack and a helping hand. You can't expect the American animation to be anything great when you sit complaining without helping.What will we do without our planet? That has been done before, true. However never like this. A few of the things that this movie could have changed are the soundtrack, editing, camera angles, and pace. The pace should have been quicker during action, the camera could have been more dramatic in chases, the editing, such as when Gune and Stith get blown up, could have waited to cut, without so choppy a transition. Finally the sound track. I think that they picked the right bands but had them play the wrong songs. Powerman 5000 is a great choice. Their CD Tonight the Stars Revolt Is practically a rock space opera. I recommend it to anyone who passed it up. Instead of creating new songs they should have used older songs that fit the mood. During the leaving earth scene Blast Off to No Where by PM5K would have fit very well.  Last Day on Earth by Marilyn Manson would have fit excellent for the introduction. It has no swearing or satanic references, and is hard rock with an acoustic guitar intro that would have fit perfectly for when young Cale is playing with his invention. Several songs used in the previews were not used in the film. Great songs that would fit the movie well and gave the previews their sticking power. I still plan to buy the soundtrack because it wasn't horrible, But I could have done better.I think a few other things could have been changed around to make it more dramatic. Rather then  Korso being the traitor that redeems himself I think it should have been Preed.  Preed redeeming himself would have given his character more depth. Although Preed is all ready one of the deepest characters. Considering Korso BuckRodgers meets Duke Nukem, Akima was poorly voicecast, Stith and Gune didn't have enough airtime, and our hero was a bit typical of American animation. (Still, I loved the movie and want my own ship of alien sidekicks. Just FYI)Overall I would say that this movie is a great example of  a film. It has American traditions but is sampling  Japanese style. Bluth made a film that has a nice stack of positives to smother the negatives. Of 10 stars I would give it 7 for mechanics and 10\/10 for  personal enjoyment. I recommend it to everyone, including diehard Anime fans. Have any of you tried to draw something like a comic strip? It is near impossible to create something consistent. Try forty installments of a comic strip. It's not easy and it gives you a lot of respect for animation like Titan. It's easy to complain when you're doing nothing. See this movie it is worth it!
