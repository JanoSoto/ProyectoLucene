Nobody does a better job of investing unlikable characters with humanity and unconscious humor than Glenn Close. The film is a study of the problems that Camille's deception create, both for others and herself.  This is a warm and appealing film that is filled with fine performances; it is the best from Altman I have seen in years.

This is the kind of film I will watch as a kind  of therapy, everyone needs this kind of fix when life becomes too mundane. I was worried that I would be disappointed with the  treatment of the gonzo classic, no need, right on the button + plenty of eye candy extras. Storming performance from Mr Depp, wild treatment from Gilliam, mental camera work and I am glad Hunter liked it, cos he rocks. Give it a 10 people you know you want to.

There are some real wackos in the film -- a dentist who remade his office into Starfleet Dental a 14-year-old who knows WAY too much about the specifics of the Starfleet uniform, a guy who payed $1400 for a piece of Klingon makeup from a DS9 episode... It's fun to watch these guys. For a Trek fan it's a there but for the grace go I feeling. But it also shows that there are normal fans, people with jobs and lives, and it shows some of the good Trek has done. The best segment in the film is Jimmy Doohan explaining how he saved a woman from committing suicide. It's pretty deep. Enjoy this movie, guys. Oh, and sit through the credits. It's worth it.

It was ultimately the Indy series which inspired my interest in archaeology, although I later realised that most archaeologists DIDN'T carry guns, whips, kill baddies and get off with beautiful women (Hey, I was young, OK?)But still, I think Temple of Doom has got to be the second best in the series (I prefer Raiders) and I just think the tight action, the excitement of the mine cart chase and the death defying finale over a croc-infested river have got to be some of the most classic scenes in movie history.Sure, Kate Capshaw gets on my nerves (Oh my Gad! repeated ad infinitum) but otherwise I think the character of Indy is well explored and gives Harrison Ford the chance to shine as a real hero character.Coincidentally, due to my height my driving is invariably compared to that of Short Round, and all of my friends think the Indy series are among some of the best films ever made.
