You know when a movie is over advertised, and sometimes that drives you more away than closer? That was my situation, but I'm glad I finally decided to give Shrek a chance.Shrek is an ogre who is feared by all the town people and prefers living his life solo, but when a annoying talking Donkey drops into his life, Donkey just kinda puts himself into Shrek's life. But when a circus drops onto Shrek's swampy home, he goes to the king, the king promises him his home back if he can go get Princess Fiona, his future bride. Shrek and Donkey do so, but Shrek ends up falling for the beautiful princess, but she has some hidden secrets of her own that just might help their love for each other.I'd have to say that I really did enjoy Shrek, it was a very sweet story with some funny jokes and terrific animation. I loved the homages to certain pop culture moments, like the Matrix, as much as it's over used joke wise, it really worked for the film and for kids who were a little too young when the Matrix came out. It's a great family film and I'd recommend it very much.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 November 2006","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I don't know if we could live in this world right now if you have not seen Shrek.

I was a little worried though when I saw that this sequel had such a low rating. Despite the fact that it was cheesy and there was a very sick situation, I thought that it was a pretty decent horror movie. This movie is a prequel to the first Amityville Horror, we learn what happened the original family and how the massacre came to be.As the family moves in, Sonny, the eldest son, is starting to hear voices, voices that are telling him to kill his family. He resists at first, but is possessed by the evil. He sleeps with his younger sister, scares a priest away from the house, and eventually is led to kill his family, only Sonny doesn't remember what happened. The family priest is the only one who knows what is going on and wants to stop the evil permanently, but we all know how that goes.The make up was highly effective, I have to admit that I had chills up my spin. But like I said, the script was a bit over the top and cheesy, and the affair was sick, I mean, brother and sister? Blah! Well, if you like horror movies, I think you might in some way like this, but otherwise, stay away, because you might be grossed out.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 November 2006","score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" I decided to get into the Amityville Horror sequels, just for fun.

Love Kubrick's vision, direction, camera management and of course, Jack himself. I have read the book 'The Shining' by Stephen King and although Kubrick's film is an entirely different interpretation, I love it! I enjoy how the whole film is panned out so you think you're inside somebody's mind, either Danny's or Jack's, and it is played out like a dream sequence. The essence and eeriness of the characters of the Overlook Hotel affecting Danny's and Jack's minds and how Kubrick directs these events is breathtaking! He's taken horror films to a whole other level and played on the more psychological side of the viewer's mind.What mostly scares you about 'The Shining' is that it is about a man who has been hired to be caretaker in a beauteous hotel for the winter, and has taken along his wife and son. He appears to be (in the book) a caring family man who, although it is clear that he is an ex-alcoholic and a struggling teacher, is trying to make a go of life with his family. In the film, that is never really brought across and I have to admit that Nicholson didn't really portray Jack Torrance as being a family man right from the start. In the opening half hour he seemed moody, edgy, irritable towards his wife, and hardly spent any time with his son. You couldn't really sense any closeness with the family and you couldn't connect to the characters, so I have to admit that when the ghosts pushed Jack into snapping and attacking his wife and son I really wasn't that shocked by it. That having been said, the scenes in which he does are brilliant. Perhaps this was Kubrick's intention, him being the amazing and original director that he was. He intended to just hit the viewer with this character and wanted to simply draw us into his madness. I have to admit that there were times when I found Wendy simply whiny and annoying, but that just goes to prove what a great actress Shelley Duvall is, and this is the exact reaction that Kubrick wanted. You are there with Wendy and Danny, sensing and feeling their terror as they run from the man they both love and trust. It's an emotional and terrifying movie and it's definitely one you need to watch over and over and over again to fully appreciate. One of the best horror movies ever made, no doubt whatsoever in my mind. ","genre":null},{"date":"14 November 2006","score":"","review":" How much do I love this film?

By the mid-80s the independent scene had begun to emerge from its obscure and relatively unknown roots. Directors placed in the indie category had unwittingly given birth to the American new-wave, whereby avant-garde cinema had slyly emerged via the underground film scene. This was paved by art directors, such as Gus Van Sant, who is often mistaken as the pioneer of a non-existent sub-genre Queer Cinema. Such a vague term is regularly misused and does not fit the body of Van Sant's works.Opening with the lonely, untouched Idaho road and emphasising the wide, desolate landscape which swarms Mike, the central protagonist to who the viewer has unwittingly been introduced to. Nothing is masked in a landscape of vast, picturesque beauty. It is in these opening moments that Van Sant instantly captures the notions, motifs, styles and themes of his magnum opus. By using time-lapse photography and exemplified close-ups for key shots Mike's narcoleptic, private Idaho state-of-mind conveys a detached and strained existence. Yet the ambiance could not be more opposed to Mike's looming, inner-torment. His heartbroken, alienated and unrequited soul echoes that of a character built from Shakespearian tragedy. Ironically, (as with many of the story's aspects) this bitter case of &#150;what is essentially- sexual identity is told through a metaphorical, estranged journey, incorporating many pathological and writing elements of Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1 & 2. Then the streets of Portland are turned into something fuelled by expressionistic, contemporary glances of wry, frisky lyricism.In many respects, My Own Private Idaho is often &#150;rightfully referred to- as a road movie, an observation which is preferably suited for a voyage of poetic exploration and self-fulfilment. It is a tale of repressed desires, held back by the confusion of a living life whereby selling one's body (to men and women) is the only way to survive. Mike is a distant wanderer of the street, forever destined to seek life on the road, as his narcoleptic state-of-mind is an unwanted escape route from his foreseen fate of falling apart from the one he so loves. You see, this is a tale following characters who are suffering from identity crisis, due to the way they have chosen\/been forced to make a living.Mike's travelling partner, Scott is more than just a friend, and is in fact the man Mike loves so dearly. During that infamous, often mentioned campfire scene Mike expresses his devotion for Scott by uttering those crucial words, I love you, and you don't pay me. Regrettably, Scott is a selfish man, wallowing in his idealistic dreams of rebellion, whilst still preserving the knowledge that he can return to his roots, inherit a fortune at any time he likes. Unlike his companion, Scott has a family, yet shows no appreciation for such needless things, casting them off for carrying the traits he indulges himself in so dearly. Mike's quest for family and home is stimulated by his repressed desire to receive the love he has always deserved, but never received, and yet it is a mere excuse for Scott to continue his self-righteous journey into oblivion.These so-called low-lives, who have no home or money might be cast-off as hoodlums by many, but Van Sant respects such people, respectfully deciding not to dismiss them. Instead he opts for obtaining an understanding of such people's moral outlook, individual perspective on life and most important of all, the reasoning behind why they subside in a state which is so against the so-called norm. As a thoughtful director, Van Sant examines a situation by not dismissing it as a singular, deluded case of rebellion. By no means is his film a gesture of remorse, but a motion of respectful gratitude. Cultural acceptance requires broad understanding; something Van Sant has an incredible talent for capturing.River Phoenix's famed performance is tough to first grasp, but ranks among the greatest of all-time. It was the true showcase of his long-gone and often reminisced career, sustained by the paradoxically referential characters he portrayed. Phoenix's image of unrequited love is both the cynic's and romantic's most desperate vision. For those who accuse Keanu Reeves of being a wooden actor, observe his chemistry with Phoenix and then tell me he is unable to prove even the slightest hint of aptitude. Both performances are achingly sensitive and longingly receptive, two emotional elements emphasised by the sensually reprehensive screenplay.Some of us get it easy in life, whilst others subconsciously take the long way round. All is not fair in love and war, but My Own Private Idaho offers comfort in the notion of narcoleptic escapism, shimmering street life and those dreamy, forgotten landscapes. This is a sweeping, majestic kind of withdrawn beauty, which clutches the viewer's soul and breaks it into tiny particles of tender humanity. Van Sant proves his auteur status, not only as a master craftsman of direction, but as a storyteller for those unexpected, everyday, tragedy-stricken individuals. A story's route should speak globally; the life-affirming Idaho road achieves such and continues to obtain much, much more. Rarely can art obtain a more emotive and lingering sensation than that of this.

By using time-lapse photography and exemplified close-ups for key shots Mike's narcoleptic, private Idaho state-of-mind conveys a detached and strained existence.

But the cure is broken when Cruella hears the toll of Big Ben, and she once again goes on a mad quest to make herself the perfect coat out of dalmation hides.This movie is bad on so many levels, starting with the fact that it's a Thanksgiving family schlock movie designed to suck every last available dime out of the Disney marketing machine. Glenn Close over-over-over-over-acts as Cruella. With all that she had to put up with in this movie -- the lame script, the endless makeup, getting baked in a cake at the end -- I hope they gave her an extremely-large paycheck.(Speaking of which, where in the world are you going to find a fur coat factory, a bakery with a Rube Goldberg assembly line, and a candlelight restaurant all located within the same building -- as you do in the climax of this film?) Of course, the real stars of the movie are supposed to be the dogs. They serve as the Macaulay Culkin's of this movie, pulling all the stupid Home Alone gags on the villains.

Basically banker Sam Wheat (Golden Globe nominated Patrick Swayze) and potter Molly Jensen (Golden Globe nominated Demi Moore) are a couple truly in love, renovating a new apartment with Sam's friend Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn), their most passionate scene is them doing pottery together, while listening to the song Unchained Melody by The Righteous Brothers (number 19 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments). Sam discovers high balances in obscure bank accounts, Sam tells Carl he'll investigate, but that night, while walking home, Sam and Molly are mugged by a street thug, he pulls a gun and in the struggle shoots, out of his body Sam is shocked to discover his own dead body, he has become a ghost. Sam stays by Molly, trying to get to grips with his condition, he cannot be heard, seen or felt, he is later shocked when the thug that killed him walks into the house, looking for something, but Molly returns and Sam scares the cat to attack the thug, he flees his mission. Sam follows him through Brooklyn and discovers his name is Willie Lopez (Rick Aviles), he tells someone on the phone he will go back for what he was looking for later. Walking the streets Sam stumbles into a spiritual reading parlor, there he witnesses con artist Oda Mae Brown (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Whoopi Goldberg) posing as a medium, but as he mocks her he realises she has an actual gift when she can hear him, he convinces her of the danger that Molly is on and to warn her. Sam convinces Oda Mae to meet Molly in person, she is skeptical, only until she relays things only Sam would know, but hearing all the danger scares Oda Mae away, so Molly goes to the police, only for them to pull Oda Mae's record, convincing Molly she is a con artist and demands her to stay away from her. Molly tells Carl this information, he goes to visit Willie at the given address, but Sam following is surprised that they are working together, Sam was murdered to obtain his book of passwords to access the bank accounts and launder money. Sam getting angered by Carl trying to get close to Molly unintentionally knocks over a picture frame, he remembers encountering a poltergeist on the subway (Tomorrow Never Dies' Vincent Schiavelli) that can move things, Sam convinces him to teach him how to do the same, after learning these abilities he returns to Oda Mae and convinces her to help him withdraw the money in the fake name Carl had set up. Oda Mae does so, taking away $4 million, she endorses the money to charity to avoid being caught, Carl tries desperately to find the money, while Sam deliberately scares him, Carl goes to Molly, where she lest slip that she saw Oda Mae at the bank, and he pieces together what has happened. Willie returns looking to catch and kill Oda Mae, Sam prevents him by terrorising him and sends him into oncoming traffic, Willie is killed and like Same did earlier sees himself dead, and his ghost is grabbed by creatures in the shadows that drag him away screaming (presumably to hell). Sam returns to Molly's apartment with Oda Mae, she is finally convinced of Sam's ghost when he levitates a coin, and Oda Mae allows him to possess her body to feel Molly and share a slow dance. Carl interrupts, so Molly and Oda Mae flee onto the fire escape, in the loft under construction he catches Oda Mae, but Molly saves her, before being grabbed and threatened by Carl with a gun, Sam disarms him and chases him to the window, trying to throw a hook at Sam he shatters the glass, and Carl is impaled by the falling glass, he becomes a ghost, and like Willie is dragged away screaming by the dark creatures. Sam speaks to the women, Molly can hear him now, a heavenly light shines in the room and illuminates Sam, the two women see him, they realise it is time for him to go (presumably to heaven), Sam and Molly share a farewell kiss, he thanks Oda Mae for everything, and he finally tells Molly he has always loved her, to which she replies his own word he repeated to her many times, Ditto, Sam then walks away into the light and disappears (this ending is number 5 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers). Also starring Armelia McQueen as Oda Mae's Sister, Gail Boggs as Oda Mae's Sister and Phil Leeds as Emergency Room Ghost. Swayze gives a surprisingly good performance as the title character, Moore is fantastic being innocent and emotional, Goldwyn is good as the snivelling villain, and Goldberg almost steals the show with her deserved Oscar winning turn as the psychic, with many comic moments. It is a film that delivers well- timed laughs and a witty script, and the supernatural element works well, with terrific special effects, it is dramatic, but most of its a sentimental but highly affectionate love story, a must see romantic drama. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Music for Maurice Jarre and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Make Up Artist, Best Original Screenplay and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy\/Musical. It was number 19 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, Unchained Melody was number 27 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, and it was number 76 on The Ultimate Film. Very, very good!

Swayze gives a surprisingly good performance as the title character, Moore is fantastic being innocent and emotional, Goldwyn is good as the snivelling villain, and Goldberg almost steals the show with her deserved Oscar winning turn as the psychic, with many comic moments. It is a film that delivers well- timed laughs and a witty script, and the supernatural element works well, with terrific special effects, it is dramatic, but most of its a sentimental but highly affectionate love story, a must see romantic drama.

Basically banker Sam Wheat (Golden Globe nominated Patrick Swayze) and potter Molly Jensen (Golden Globe nominated Demi Moore) are a couple truly in love, renovating a new apartment with Sam's friend Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn), their most passionate scene is them doing pottery together, while listening to the song Unchained Melody by The Righteous Brothers (number 19 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments). Sam discovers high balances in obscure bank accounts, Sam tells Carl he'll investigate, but that night, while walking home, Sam and Molly are mugged by a street thug, he pulls a gun and in the struggle shoots, out of his body Sam is shocked to discover his own dead body, he has become a ghost. Sam stays by Molly, trying to get to grips with his condition, he cannot be heard, seen or felt, he is later shocked when the thug that killed him walks into the house, looking for something, but Molly returns and Sam scares the cat to attack the thug, he flees his mission. Sam follows him through Brooklyn and discovers his name is Willie Lopez (Rick Aviles), he tells someone on the phone he will go back for what he was looking for later. Walking the streets Sam stumbles into a spiritual reading parlor, there he witnesses con artist Oda Mae Brown (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Whoopi Goldberg) posing as a medium, but as he mocks her he realises she has an actual gift when she can hear him, he convinces her of the danger that Molly is on and to warn her. Sam convinces Oda Mae to meet Molly in person, she is skeptical, only until she relays things only Sam would know, but hearing all the danger scares Oda Mae away, so Molly goes to the police, only for them to pull Oda Mae's record, convincing Molly she is a con artist and demands her to stay away from her. Molly tells Carl this information, he goes to visit Willie at the given address, but Sam following is surprised that they are working together, Sam was murdered to obtain his book of passwords to access the bank accounts and launder money. Sam getting angered by Carl trying to get close to Molly unintentionally knocks over a picture frame, he remembers encountering a poltergeist on the subway (Tomorrow Never Dies' Vincent Schiavelli) that can move things, Sam convinces him to teach him how to do the same, after learning these abilities he returns to Oda Mae and convinces her to help him withdraw the money in the fake name Carl had set up. Oda Mae does so, taking away $4 million, she endorses the money to charity to avoid being caught, Carl tries desperately to find the money, while Sam deliberately scares him, Carl goes to Molly, where she lest slip that she saw Oda Mae at the bank, and he pieces together what has happened.

It is realistic because nothing is sugar-coated. Think of other films offered up to the public that year. Mr. Mom; (disingenuous, and insulting to the audience). Money Pit. Need I go on?.A decent film does not insult its audience. A good film makes them think. A masterpiece; well...those are few and far between. This film is almost brilliant, because it depicts tragedy, and the way that the characters must move on (albeit how imperfectly). Jeff Daniels as the philandering son in law; Shirley Maclaine as the dominant yet loving mother; Debra Winger as the struggling and too loving mom, married to a n'er do well; but loves her children.It is a serious theme, hence explaining the need for Nicholson. Granted, at this point in time we have seen him as the cynic way too many times, but at the time of this film his interactions with MacLaine were fresh, comic, and realistic.The awkward scenes between Debra Winger and John Lithgow engage the audience; two people alienated and trying to connect, having an affair in Nebraska. The scenes where Daniels moves the family to several different towns are classic; the kids are engaging and effective. In fact this is the ONLY film I can think of where a director has humanly portrayed children as complex and interesting, rather than irritating and noisome.Maclaine is at times overbearing, but understandably so. She is also the matriarch. Danny DeVito is also available for comic relief, as several wealthy widowers pursue Maclaine. This story was written by Larry McMurty (Lonesome Dove, Evening Star). I highly recommend it; if you have a family audience it is a great conversation piece. My Dad and I have two generations between us; and he is the greatest critic, not easily impressed, and he remembers the great films of the 40's. This is the one film which will meet, and exceed your expectations. 9\/10.
