[{"date":"22 September 2010","score":"","review":" Rushmore is the kind of comedy that just isn't all that funny. It is well made, and does contain a few momentous comic fires, but never enough to recommend of that genre. Its really more dramatic though not much. Some audiences may find the material quite bleak, while others may think it is obscured. Doubtless, not many people will find it raveable.The film's protagonist is a trouble making student at the Rushmore Academy named Max Fisher, one of the greatest schools in America. He loves where he goes to school, more than anything. He gets poor grades, but is apart of many clubs\/teams. In a particular scene he states that Rushmore is his life. This un-realistic lust for schooling is necessary for developing the character's personality which latter carries the dim plot though turmoil.After the Max character is fully understood, we begin to receive plot clinches of all sorts. First, Max is threatened with sudden death expulsion since he is such a bad student. Second, he ominously falls in love with a first grade teacher who also works at Rushmore. Her name is Miss Cross. Then Max begins to do very strange things, like building an aquarium in replacement of the school's baseball diamond. Not your typical student, this is how he gets expelled from Rushmore and gets sent to another school.The film's antagonist is Mr. Blume, who is an old grumpy, almost full time drunk, mentor who works at Rushmore. He also loves Miss. Cross, which eventually leads to an affair involving the two. Max then becomes jealous and serious, and at times, dangerous conflicts result. Though Max and Mr.Blume are close friends. In many scenes Mr.Blume and Max both refer to one another as friends The film starts out promising and different, then kinda downfalls. It goes downhill from the point where he meets Margaret Yang, then when she becomes more in the story. The last few scenes at the play are rather boring and dull and could have been much better. I also didn't like the ending too much ","genre":null},{"date":"22 September 2010","score":"","review":" Rushmore is the kind of comedy that just isn't all that funny.
