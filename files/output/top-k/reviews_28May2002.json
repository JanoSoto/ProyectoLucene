The fun and melodramatic world of Luke, Han, Leia, and Chewie has been chewed up and spit out into a cud of technological mishmash and confusing, boring plot lines.  Though hints of the old magic are there, Lucas absolutely refuses to engage with it, choosing glitter over substance.First, what was good with this movie?  Regrettably, there is very little to say.  Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan and Christopher Lee's Count Dooku were the only characters I enjoyed seeing on the screen.  I don't want to give anything away, but one of the new planets was exhilarating, there was one good fight scene, and one good chase scene.What was bad?  Alas, I have only 1000 words.  First, the plot was dull. Beginning the movie with an intergalactic vote is hardly a way to create interest.  Also, everything felt derivative.  There were pale copies of settings and scenes from Blade Runner and Fifth Element.  And the battle scenes are unintelligible, inhuman copies of battles from Episode I.The development of the Jedi doesn't occur.  The magic of their type is forgotten, they are made common, vulgar, and dull.The acting is horrible.  Christensen, as Skywalker, slurs his lines and is unbelievably inarticulate.  It was a tough character to pull off arrogant, angry, fearful, increasingly evil, and falling in love.  Lucas needed a better actor.  Portman, whose monotonous rambling normally puts me to sleep, turned into a real actress next to Christensen's meager attempts.  Oh, yes, and these two fell in love?  When?  In one of those terribly boring and embarrassing, incongruous relationship scenes?This film was episodic and had no flow.  The acting was terrible, the story, worse.  There was no fun in this movie, the only characters who inspired humor and lightness were Kenobi, R2D2, and C3PO.  This series feels, right now, as if Lucas is just going through the motions, putting as much fluff and glitter on it as he can, like a sitcom or TV series that ran its course years ago, and he is just trying to end it for the sake of ending it.

But I do not think it is Welles' best. (That's either `Othello' or `Lady from Shanghai' depending on your religion.)First of all, this is not the work of a genius, but the excellent product of three committed artisans Welles, Tobin and Mankiewicz.Mankiewicz, with his brother, were the industry's working intellectuals. Here (aided by Houseman), he simply got a client intelligent enough to know what was up. Similarly with Tobin, who was the Sascha Vierny of his day. These two men pulled on Welles, but as we will see, in independent directions.The story, Hearst and all that, is irrelevant except for the notion that a writer in the right place can create reality if willing to pay the price. The acting is fine of course, uncharacteristically abstract -- but that's hardly innovative nor groundshaking. No, what makes this film important are two features, and the failed relationship between them.The first of these is the incredibly complex narrative structure. Things that are normally nested frames a reminiscent flashback, a text annotated with pictures... are here multiply set up and in turn enfolded into the film proper. We see a newsreel, whose footage later appears in the `real' action; we have a recalled death vision of a childhood but that becomes untenably self-critical; we see her singing and again from her perspective. We have several on-screen narrators but each gets swallowed. There are so many narrative devices at work it keeps us spinning, sledding as each comes into play and is then reabsorbed. The puzzle is assembled several different ways. Nowhere else is such narrative cleverness been even attempted, not by Lynch, Bergman, Wenders, anyone.The other innovation is the breaking of convention with the eye of the camera. The camera takes positions -- physical and philosophical -- that were previously utterly unknown. Previously, the camera was audience supplemented by `context' shots perspectives that a human observer might not see but that seemed natural. Now, the camera is something unto itself that we have to accommodate. The camera does things no human would or could. It sometimes (often!) sees two things simultaneously, something that never happens with the natural eye. It has a curiosity that we would not have directed. The eye defines the lighting, not the other way around -- here everything is colored not by what it is, but by how the film's eye changes it.Both of these experiments are masterful. They changed the world of films, and hence dreams, and hence all of abstract thinking forever.But the flaw, the lethal problem with this film is that the two experiments have independent lives. They are not coordinated beyond some fairly easy touchpoints and then only in the simplest of ways an image that is being described by a speaker and the nature of the newsreel. It is as if there were TWO geniuses at work, each doing something important and neither communicating with the other. So when there is a shift or a trick in the narrative, the eye is ignorant of it.But hey, it was just the man's first film. He quickly fixed that in `Othello' and especially `Shanghai.' The merger of eye and narrative is the real revolution. `Kane' raised the question, which is why it is important. Tarkovsky, some Bergman, Malick, Greenaway have subsequently succeeded with this merger using different devices, but the master is Kurosawa. Welles made Kurosawa possible.

Insipid implies a lack of taste or flavor and is, hence, figuratively applied to anything that is lifeless, dull, etc. I think I may have found a new favorite word. Insipid describes exactly how I felt about this good for nothing movie. Rose McGowan, Julie Benz, and Rebecca Gayheart play three popular girls in high school. As a birthday prank, they kidnap their other best friend so they can humiliate her in front of the whole school. In doing so, they stuff a very large jawbreaker in her mouth to keep her quiet. She accidently swallows it and dies. When a quiet non-popular girl (Judy Evans Greer) finds out, the popular girls tell her that to buy her silence, they will make her popular.
