The film is quite good and received much attention (and publicity) as it promised stunning special effects around a sophisticated and compelling plot.Well, the effects were as expected for a contemporary, expensive sci-fi adventure. My only objection are the monitors that presumably display the undecoded Matrix, it is quite a disgrace for those who know a little about computers (a hint  about how much data do you suppose a text screen can contain? Enough to describe a virtual world or even small portions of it?)As for the plot, it is based on the idea of people being enslaved in a constructed world by an other race, without being able to realize it, until there comes the chosen one, a human who learns the truth and eventually discovers and puts into use powers and abilities that exceed those of the dominant race. This all sounds interesting enough, but the basic problem is that the above exact lines of text can be used to describe another movie. This movie is Dark City by the creator of The Crow. If Dark City was written prior to The Matrix, then the later lacks originality. The new elements in The Matrix scenario make it seem more complex and more hi-tech, so as to appeal to the audience. The scenario is also more pessimistic, which is the easier way to move the viewer, in contrast, Dark City achieves the same (or more) just by its dark and gloomy ambiance. So, both movies present a human nightmare, with The Matrix being the more colorful one. The more complex scenario, which features more technological concepts, such as Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality therefore drawing more hi-tech addicted audience, bears one major weakness  an abrupt and unfulfilling ending. The plot arrives to a point where it simply cannot continue, as the hero becomes almost a god but ONLY for the virtual world. A scent of victory is the ending, but we immediately realize that it is virtual (not actual) too.There is a lot of action in this movie. It's a pity the director used too much of the old-fashioned slow motion technique in most of the fight scenes, which holds back the fast action; in a few scenes the technique was essential, but in others it was just easier. The sound is excellent and I can say the same for the soundtrack. Keanou Reeves performed his best (along with Devils Advocate) and the rest of the cast does very well in delivering a stylish (remember Men In Black) and very entertaining film.So, go watch this film, but first watch it's darker flip-side by Alex Proyas  Dark City. As for me, I enjoyed the film, but I believe it was not worth such a high place in IMDb's top 250. If the plot was conceived before Dark City, then I would rate the movie a 9\/10. Otherwise, a 7-8\/10 would me more appropriate. ","genre":null},{"date":"6 September 1999","score":"","review":" I saw The Matrix a few days ago.

Many people say Sean Connery is the best bond of all time, because he was the Bond with the most charisma. Very true, but he doesn't have the best portrayal of Ian Fleming character, and from the novel's standpoint he is not easily the best James Bond. Timothy Dalton is beyond great in this movie.

Licence to Kill wasn't alone that year far as box-office disappointments, because Ghostbusters II and Indiana Jones and Last Crusade were box-office gross were disappointing as well.

There is not a SINGLE redeeming quality in this film aside from the acting of Helen Mirren.  The camerawork is non-existent.  The story?  Same thing!  In middle eastern countries they probably cut writer's hands off for creating something this horrible!Why is it so awful, you ask?  Well let's start at the beginning of the film. Leigh Ann Watson is another pretty girl who wants to go to college, but apparently has to be valevictorian(sp?) to get a scholarship to so much as the local state U.  She puts a lot of effort into a school project, but not a lot into actually acting opposite the actress that plays the mother. She ends up with a C+ on the afforementioned assignment, and so she manipulates her fellow talentless hottie and a guy who can't act to go the the evil teacher's house.  Whackiness ensues, and Tingle somehow ends up held hostage by (gasp!) a crossbow!!!  Where do they come up with this stuff!  Tingle spends the next hour manipulating the trio (which they never catch on to) until the boring, unrealistic climax.Katie Holmes manages to be better than her material, which doesn't say a whole lot.

It's so bad I had to lock my eyes firmly on the floor the whole time.  No nude scene has ever been so downright embarassing to watch as this fully clothed display of talent.  The other scene to stand out was when Katie is looking at the coach's wife reading her Bible.  Katie's reflection is projected unto a covered window.  However, it's so faint you can barely see it!

Some punching violent fighting scenes, VAN DAMME style kickboxing and lots of bloody needless closeups, the type of images that make the usual macho braindead crowd cheer with excitment and drool spit all over the person who´s in front. So i was going to press fast forward on my Vcr, when Gary Busey appeared on screen. And i was finding pretty strange that Kurt Russel would be in such a bad kickboxing movie, anyway. So i decided to give it on more chance.And now im glad i did. Because for some strange reason, i really ended up enjoying this movie very much. I think it was the action movie i liked the most in recent years. Am i crazy ?!! Even i, am doubting of my sanity right now.First i liked the atmosphere in this movie. The idea of the garbage planet and how the humans got to live there was not the most original thing in the world, but it was very well presented, and the landscapes really looked very good. Then i liked the visual style in the special effects. I normally hate this kind of computer graphics, but in SOLDIER i didn´t thought they were all that bad. Ok, they look like computer graphics, but are there any movie in which this is diferent ?!! Even in MATRIX or in TITANIC we clearly see when they use computer animation, so why this now would be an excuse to dislike this movie ?Then i think Kurt Russel ,did a very good job with a character like this. True, he doesn´t have many lines, but this fits perfectly with the character. And despite that, this character has much more humanity, than any other carboard war character i ever seen. Something RAMBO wish it had. Soldier was a person, and i think a very credible one, which acted as someone with his background suposed to act. In this case if it had more dialogue i think it would look much more artificial.Despite all the violence in this movie, i liked the fact there even the cliché situations managed to create a believable human atmosphere. Even the bad guys, were not so bad. Probably the only villain this movie has his the commander of the troops. All others are just people like the Soldier who got into opposite sides by chance of fate.So i liked this movie very much, it might not be a such a great piece of art, but it´s an entertaining movie, and i think it has much more depth than it seems at first. Beyond the aparent emptiness of its screenplay and its characters, realy can makes us think and pose some interesting questions about the future of War.And this is a very interesting thing for a movie that is suposed to be so bad.Believe me, there are much worst things you can watch.

Cyborg, an early Van Damme vehicle, is probably one of the stupidest, slowest-moving films I have ever seen, and I simply don't understand what compelled the producers to make it.I rate this film a 2 on a scale of 1 to 10, and the 2 is for two particular scenes that were well done. The first is the opening scene, in which there is a narration by the film's villain that promises an interesting, campy film. It absolutely got my attention, and I was looking forward to a fun, circus of a film. But alas, it would not be thus! As soon as characters are shown for the first time, the film sinks. There's really no plot, and it's really only a series of action-sequences featuring Van Damme and his sidekicks (one of whom is the female cyborg, who really serves no purpose but to attract male viewers to a pretty face) running from a group of mean pirate people, led by a guy who looks a lot like Mario Van Peebles from Highlander The Final Dimension who likes to scream at random and decapitate people.The second part I liked was a scene in the sewers in which our hero, Van Damme, is hiding in the shadows. The way he kills his attacker is nicely shot, and other than that, it's a mindless romp which feature some wasted sets and not a single good cast member, save maybe Van Damme's female sidekick.Actually, Van Damme's character has a pretty interesting past, which we see through a series of flashbacks. If they had taken that storyline from his past and used it as the main premise, it could have been a pretty good movie. That was actually a moving story. But no, all this is is a stupid, mindless mess that tries to be a homage to Mad Max and instead ranks among Plan 9 From Outer Space as a waste of time and effort.

I can't quite get my thoughts about it in order.  Please bare with me.  Well, after viewing it once I felt it was supposed to be seen as a psycho-thriller.  It certainly seemed to be that way; the whole film was just very creepy.  And yet, it's not hard to see why it's viewed today as a camp classic and has attracted a large cult audience.  The big reason is undoubtedly Bette Davis's performance; in her whacko portrayal of a crazy former child star, she goes completely over-the-top and obviously relishes stealing scenes from her old rival, Joan Crawford.  It isn't hard for her to do; Crawford doesn't have much to say or do except break down whenever she gets a dead animal served to her for dinner and be frightened of and yet totally dependant on her crazy sister, Davis.  Still, Davis is creepy, espicially in the last couple of scenes when she suddenly starts acting like a little kid and you know she's completely gone.  I found a lot of similarities to Sunset Boulevard.  The same story line (star of an old, dead entertainment form lives in the past, goes crazy thinking she can make a comeback, and completely controls the people closest to her), although Baby Jane lives in the now a lot more than Norma Desmond and Joe Gillis had a lot more freedom than Blanche.  Also, the last scenes of both are very similar.  (I may write some spoilers in the next couple of sentences.) Jane dancing on the beach reminded me of Norma getting ready for her closeup.  Both have killed that person closest to them (I think it's safe to say Blanche died) and will no doubt be arrested, but both think everyone's come to watch them in their new picture or new act and have no idea what's going on.  In other words, both have met pathetic ends.  But Sunset Boulevard was a better film; this one is overlong and after a while gets to be a bit much.  If you choose to watch it, view it first for what it is a creepy psycho thriller.  Then, view it as a camp classic and cult movie.

Outside there might be sun, drought, wind and snow, all largely visited at nature's whim; inside there's all sorts of very human dangers, including infidelity, cheating, financial and legal corruption, and witchcraft - which can all be largely seen as a breaking down of loyalty and trust. War, the demands of the market-place and changing times in general, are shown to have bought a dislocation to the traditional rural certainties of conduct and order; the same forces splitting both the community at large and individual families.Ed Buscombe's masterly review in Sight and Sound articulated my own slight sense of disappointment with the film. He rightly saw that the character of Big Boy, as played by Woody Harrelson, fails to convince that he is worthy of the strength of love and loyalty that Pete and others feel for him. As Buscombe says, his antics too often subside into a charmless boorishness - contrast this say with Kristofferson's Billy the Kid for Peckinpah, whose behaviour is equally wild but we never doubt his basic goodness and accept the affection in which he is generally held.The film's recreation of the1940s was very nicely done with terrific locations and just enough of the right artefacts to suggest the period, rather than an over-dressed museum tableau. The film cleverly slips between that contemporary world and an oppositional timelessness in the unchanging rhythm of the cowboy's life.  I liked the way the film's characters acknowledge the anachronistic effort required to follow the cowboy life in 1940s post war USA I hear you're having an old fashioned cattle drive Mona says to Pete, and earlier when Pete suggests to Jim Ed Love, the cattle baron, that people still drive their cattle to the railhead he replies only in the movies.More than a nod then to Red River, with its fascination with the changing demands of the market place and the effects those changes bring to ranch and cowboy. At heart HiLo is not much more than a rather tacky melodrama but its still very watchable its lovingly shot, it just about keeps the western mythology alive and it has some great songs. It also has good supporting performances from Billy Crudup (Pete), Patricia Arquette (Mona) and Rosaleen Linehan (Mrs Big Boy), in particular.
