Cushing hardly does anything in it except be there (though, for Cushing, that's enough to make him fantastic anyway), whilst Lee sports a terrible comedy moustache and at one point shows that he can punch, kick, fence, karate chop and use a rifle pretty much all at the same time, the cunning bastard.The film trots along going nowhere fast, and then all of a sudden Telly Savalas from Kojak (Who loves ya' baby?) appears with his own unique style of acting (basically, wander about like a queen being hip and cool whilst fooling nobody) and takes charge for absolutely no reason at all. And the ending is one of the quickest and most inept finales to a horror film I've ever seen. There's also some bizarre funky whistling music going on throughout, and some wonderful, if dire, dialogue (from memory) CUSHING Are you saying that a creature that's been dead for over a few million years came back to life, got out of that crate, killed the baggage man, put him *into* the crate, and then locked it all up again neat and tidy?

The premise is so simple that it's almost a parody of movie pitches (Homer Simpson's line was I saw this movie about a bus that had to SPEED around a city, keeping its SPEED over fifty, and if its SPEED dropped, it would explode! I think it was called 'The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down'.). Fortunately this film came to be much better than the sum of its parts, and it's deservedly remembered as one of the most entertaining films of the 90s.What distinguishes Speed is its humanity, due in no small part to the character of Annie (Sandra Bullock). The best example of this is the moment when Annie, while driving the bus, thinks she has struck a baby stroller. She becomes so distraught that she lets go of the steering wheel, never mind the fact that she is in charge of driving a bomb-laden bus through the L.A. suburbs. It's one of several moments that draw us into the film by helping us identify with the characters, and it's all the more elegant for its simplicity. This movie isn't complex, but it doesn't claim to be.There is a certain irony that Speed succeeds so well on a human level, since Jan de Bont is not generally considered an actor's director. He started as a cinematographer, and even when he talks about directing he discusses technical aspects and seldom mentions working with actors. Nowhere was this more evident than Speed 2, which pretty much killed his directorial career. Given that, it's all the more remarkable what he pulled off in the original Speed, as everything seemed to come together for him.The overall performances really serve this picture well. Keanu is at his best (which is to say, mediocre), Sandra launched a career based on this movie, and Dennis Hopper did a wonderful job as the sardonic villain.

Censors are often just as bad as the people they try to censor.Art does not create bad deeds The Marquis (Geoffrey Rush) is an evil character. There is no doubt about that. He believes that rape and torture are acceptable. But does the awfulness of his beliefs justify censorship? There are no bad words... only bad deeds. The tagline of this film basically gives us the point of view of its makers. It's not words we should fear, but actions.Only weak people are negatively influenced by art The Marquis does his best to try to undermine the religious beliefs of the Abbe du Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix) by both openly attacking his faith and putting sexual desires into his head. Yet the Abbe never abandons his faith or his celibacy. Despite the fact that Madeleine is the one smuggling the Marquis' writing out of the asylum and despite the fact that she enjoys his writing, she dies a virgin. She has never acted on what she has read. The only character who does act on what she has read is Simone (Amelia Warner). However, she has been raised in a convent and has been forced to marry a man who is old enough to be her grandfather. Simone seduces and runs away with her husband's architect. The Marquis' writing put the ideas into her head, but that is all. It is Simone's sorry circumstances that led to her actions. Censors are often just as bad as the people they try to censor Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) is sent by Napolean to deal with the Marquis and stop him from writing. The doctor is a hypocrite. He punishes the Marquis for his illicit writing while he himself imprisons his young wife and rapes her night after night.

The question becomes if we allow censorship who will get to decide what is censored and what isn't, especially when many self-appointed moralists have plenty of moral failings of their own?

Star Wars grossed 460 million $ in U.S. cinemas making it the most commercial movie of the 1970s. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe for best picture, director and supporting actor Alec Guiness. For all those categories it was nominated also for an Oscar. The movie won 7 Oscars, but only in technical categories, while the one for best picture went to Woody Allen's Annie Hall. Many were outraged at that Oscar decision, but I think this is one of the few times I would agree with the academy.I like Star Wars, really I do.

Here is a movie that has been almost universally acclaimed by every expert worth his salt as the greatest of all-time. The American Film Institute chose it. On the Sight and Sound Poll it was a near unanimous choice. Yet there is still a very large amount of people who have not seen this movie. It's not as mainstream of a Best Movie Ever as, say, The Godfather, but still this is inexcusable.The most likely reason for this is that Citizen Kane is a black-and-white film from 1941. This may turn off modern movie-goers but not me. Convinced that the Godfather was the greatest movie ever and wanting to see for myself if Citizen Kane was as good as people claimed, I rented it just yesterday, February 28. Let me just say the first word that comes to my mind.Wow. I'll say it again. Wow. Here is a movie that is over 60 years old, from the year America went into World War II. This film came out before Pearl Harbor, when Adolf Hitler was Fuehrer of Germany. Yet its direction is still unparalleled in the industry. The main reason for Citizen Kane's place in movie expert's hearts is for its insanely innovative technical prowess. It is almost impossible to explain just how revolutionary this direction is. Just about every movie since Citizen Kane has taken something from this movie. Yet it is still the golden light among movie direction. I was so stunned watching this film. Despite all the technical limitations of his time, despite the very simple methods of making movies that were prominent in the early 1900s, this film is so technically perfect that it is impossible for any reasonable man to deny its place among the very, very greatest movies ever. I just cannot explain in this space the perfection of this movie's direction. Orson Welles is an absolute genius when it comes to the cinema.And apparently, not only did Welles orchestrate the technically finest film ever made, he is also a superb actor! Watching this movie I was immensely impressed with Charles Foster Kane and the actor who immortalized him. The entire time I was thinking, who could this be? I concentrated during the credits and found out that Orson Welles himself played the star in his signature movie. This is honestly one of the best acting performances I've ever seen, and Kane is the most memorable character this side of Vito Corleone I've ever met in my experiences with the cinema.Charles Foster Kane was a world-famous newspaper tycoon, the most powerful media puppetmaster America had ever known. It is generally accepted that this character was based off of William Randolph Hurst, but that's beside the point. When he died in 1941 with his empire in shambles, he uttered one last word before falling. Rosebud. One reporter is assigned to find out what this word meant. To do so he interviews the most central figures in Kane's life. It is through this story that the movie comes alive. Through this Welles displays all sorts of flashbacks, which are essentially the movie itself, of Kane's life. All of the important chapters in his saga are covered in an attempt to find out what Rosebud really means. In the process, we see a frighteningly deep display into a man who got everything he wanted in life and then subsequently lost it, his lust for material possessions to replace something else he had lost, his determination to have everything he desired what drove him through life. This all culminates in the ending which has to rank as the greatest and most thought-provoking I've ever seen. It is this ending that pieces together the puzzle of Kane's life and his struggle. It lays everything to rest, and at the end there is not one stone unturned. The ending makes everything make sense.The acting in Citizen Kane is not especially memorable aside from Welles, nor is the soundtrack, but give us a break, this is 1941. Aside from that Citizen Kane features some of the most memorable scenes and subplots ever told. Three that particularly stand out are Leland's review, Kane's attempt at politics, and the attempt at turning his second wife into an opera singer. I won't spoil the story any further than this.In conclusion, Citizen Kane is a movie that no intellectual human being should go their life without seeing. It is, simply put, a masterpiece, one of only two movies at this point I would give a 10 on IMDb. But is it the best movie of all-time? My opinions have changed in this matter. I now understand why all of the critics acclaim this above all else. In my heart I would still choose The Godfather, and as you can see I am giving Coppola's masterpiece a slightly higher rating, but in my mind these are the two greatest motion pictures ever created and nothing else can approach this pair of colossal giants. Perhaps it is because the Godfather features a wider cast of subplots and characters, rather than Citizen Kane focusing on one man, but in reality it is near impossible to point out any flaws in these two pieces of perfection. This is a movie that is both technically perfect and intellectually dazzling, a film that is both superb at face value and within our mind. It is a stirring piece of cinema that is and deserves to be more revered than any of its brethren. 9.7. There is nothing more to say, but, I'm Charles Foster Kane!

In the movie, Paul Newman plays a man who lives in a small town. He personifies the very individualistic mindset.Having nothing to do and no friends, Luke (Newman) decides to do a little drinking while cutting the heads off of parking meters. When confronted by the police, Luke acts like he is drunk (either he is actually acting or he actually is drunk) and finds his way into prison .Once in prison, Luke joins a chain gang. All goes well and, despite a rough start, the inmates begin to like him. He even makes a friend in the form of Dragline, an illiterate man played by George Kennedy. Luke is just about to get out of the prison. Then fate deals him a bad hand.Luke learns about his mother's death. In his sorrow, Luke breaks out of prison, only to be caught. He escapes again, only to be caught and beaten. Then, he takes a prison truck and escapes along with Dragline, only to be shot by a very accurate prison guard.This film comments on society's treatment of the individual. In the beginning of the film, Luke's attitude equals the epitome of self sufficiency. He is a loner who considers rules and regulations, as he puts it in the scene with the famous Night in the Box speech, nothin' worth listenin' to. As he lives on in the prison, his attitude of I don't need you frustrates the prison officials who try to get his mind right repeatedly. They take their dismay, and persist in doing this despite it's lack of effectiveness, to the point that they beat Luke. Luke fights them at every turn. They lie and beat him, showing this most sadistically in a scene where they tell Luke to get his dirt out of the captain's ditch. They make him get the dirt out, then complain about the unavoidable effect of having that dirt on the lawn when he is done. He has to put the dirt back in. Right after that, he is forced to take the dirt back out again. This cycle continues until Luke reaches the point where he lashes out in frustration, only to be beaten to the point where he falls into the ditch. He comes back out, wrapping his arms around the nearest guard, crying about how his mind is now right.Then there is the climactic scene with Lukein a church. Dragline comes in and tries to get Luke to give up peaceably. Here, Dragline represents society's desire to get everyone to just mindlessly conform to its ways. Luke refuses, and ironically gets shot. This shooting is interesting if nothing else for the fact that the authorities not only have no reason to believe Luke is armed, but also for the fact that he gets shot for impersonating a prison official. Luke's soul has refused to conform to society's rules and ends up needing to get extinguished.Thus, Cool Hand Luke becomes a comment on society. Luke dislikes the need of his fellow inmates to latch onto him so tightly. Luke dislikes rules, becoming a non-conformist. Society has constantly tried to extinguish the non-conformists. Examples include the Civil Rights Movement, the Feminist Movement, and the homosexuals. Like them, Luke is also a non-conformist. Like them, society clashes with Luke. Like them, society tries to kill Luke. Too bad society has not learned to deal with other people's views.

Luke is just about to get out of the prison. Then fate deals him a bad hand.Luke learns about his mother's death. In his sorrow, Luke breaks out of prison, only to be caught. He escapes again, only to be caught and beaten. Then, he takes a prison truck and escapes along with Dragline, only to be shot by a very accurate prison guard.This film comments on society's treatment of the individual. In the beginning of the film, Luke's attitude equals the epitome of self sufficiency. He is a loner who considers rules and regulations, as he puts it in the scene with the famous Night in the Box speech, nothin' worth listenin' to. As he lives on in the prison, his attitude of I don't need you frustrates the prison officials who try to get his mind right repeatedly. They take their dismay, and persist in doing this despite it's lack of effectiveness, to the point that they beat Luke. Luke fights them at every turn. They lie and beat him, showing this most sadistically in a scene where they tell Luke to get his dirt out of the captain's ditch. They make him get the dirt out, then complain about the unavoidable effect of having that dirt on the lawn when he is done. He has to put the dirt back in. Right after that, he is forced to take the dirt back out again. This cycle continues until Luke reaches the point where he lashes out in frustration, only to be beaten to the point where he falls into the ditch. He comes back out, wrapping his arms around the nearest guard, crying about how his mind is now right.Then there is the climactic scene with Lukein a church. Dragline comes in and tries to get Luke to give up peaceably. Here, Dragline represents society's desire to get everyone to just mindlessly conform to its ways. Luke refuses, and ironically gets shot. This shooting is interesting if nothing else for the fact that the authorities not only have no reason to believe Luke is armed, but also for the fact that he gets shot for impersonating a prison official. Luke's soul has refused to conform to society's rules and ends up needing to get extinguished.Thus, Cool Hand Luke becomes a comment on society. Luke dislikes the need of his fellow inmates to latch onto him so tightly. Luke dislikes rules, becoming a non-conformist. Society has constantly tried to extinguish the non-conformists. Examples include the Civil Rights Movement, the Feminist Movement, and the homosexuals. Like them, Luke is also a non-conformist. Like them, society clashes with Luke.

I finally got around to seeing it recently on DVD and I can say with much certainty that it's one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. I guess I was expecting a typical sort of Hugh Grant romantic comedy, but it's nothing like that at all. I found it very similar in tone to movies like Rushmore and even American Beauty, but with a lot more laughs than either of those dramedies.I've never felt too strongly one way or another about Hugh Grant, but he is spot-on perfect in this film as a rich bachelor who lives off his father's money and doesn't have a care in the world. He prides himself on living a life of luxury and comfort, and avoiding complicated relationships. Cleary one of his best performances, Grant's interpretation of Will is shallow and cynical but layered with potential. By chance, he enters the life of a depressed single mother (Toni Collette) and her 12 year old son (Nicholas Hoult) who is in desperate need of some type of a male role model. There's a lot going on and several different sub-plots but essentially events unfold that further entangle Will into these people's lives. And ultimately he must decide if he is going to withdraw to his posh apartment and stay disconnected from people, or face the music and accept that truly no man is an island.Nicholas Hoult also gives a very strong performance for a first time actor. This is one of those films where every actor seems to be the ideal choice for the character they play, right down to the smallest roles. The moments of hilarious comedy are nicely balanced with a serious, at times melancholy, story. I'm sure there are some deep lessons here about how families can be created in all kinds of different circumstances, and are not always defined by bloodlines alone. Or about maturity, growing up, and finding meaning in life. All of that is probably true, but at the end of the day About a Boy is just a very enjoyable, funny movie that is well worth an hour and a half. An awesome soundtrack too makes this a must see film.

Such was the case with Haiku Tunnel, a movie which was described to me as Office Space, only better. Since I thought Office Space was genius (well, the first two thirds of it, anyway; it has some trouble at the end), I was eager to see a movie that might have taken the formula a step further and gotten it completely right.I'm still eager to see that film, because Haiku Tunnel sure isn't it; if anything the film only reinforces my vague discomfort with word of mouth recommendations. Haiku is the story of one Josh Kornbluth (actor, director, writer, and orchestrator of this mess), a temp who decides against his better judgement to go perm at a law firm. Josh, as it turns out, is a pretty good temp, but a lousy perm worker. And that's pretty much the whole movie.Kornbluth tries really hard &#150; in fact way too hard &#150; to be funny. There are a few chuckles in the film, such as when the ice queen head secretary shows up, or passes by, the soundtrack plays wind blowing in the background. But a great deal of the film isn't even that clever; it's mostly Josh talking about how lazy and unmotivated he is. It's hard to sympathize with someone who has a semi-romantic relationship with his bed (not kidding there) and who looks like a human version of Jon Lovitz' cartoon character The Critic. Worse yet, Kornbluth's narration overexplains everything (and he makes the ghastly mistake of addressing the audience up front for nearly five minutes before the movie starts; apparently he skipped the class in film school where they explain how the beginning of a movie is supposed to catch people's interest); he leeches even the potential humor out of most of his situations, until you're left with about ninety minutes of someone explaining his own jokes, which isn't quite as much fun as it sounds.Haiku Tunnel is one you can definitely skip. I suppose some might find Kornbluth's attempts at humor engaging, but if you want to see a funny movie about the office, watch the first hour of Office Space; if you want to see a funny movie about unmotivated people, check out Slackers. If, however, you want to see someone who is woefully unfunny spend an hour and a half painfully trying to convince you otherwise, then by all means, give Haiku Tunnel a try.

The Rocky Horror Picture Show has an amazing line up of actors including Tim Curry (best movie I have seen him in yet) and every actor plays the role of their character extremely well. And the soundtrack to The Rocky Horror Picture show lets you actually see what is going on in the movie.

Perhaps I watched it one too many times because now I can't stand this movie. Danielle Harris, Christina Applegate, and Joanna Cassidy are good although Joanna's haircut was a bad choice. David Duchovny can also be seen in an early role with bad hair. A little residual eighties bubbling to the surface. This is again that time in the late eighties and early nineties where all the colors are oddly, unnaturally dark. Josh Charles just doesn't come off very charming. I never liked him in this movie. He looks like he could pass for a Bundy with his nose which makes him creepy. There are too many caricatures in this movie as well. The dork with the heart of gold. The stoner escaping responsibility. The fickle yet smart girl. The evil babysitter. Yawn. I also can't stand the kids outsmarting the adults in cute ways genre like Catch That Kid. If I want uncontrollable cute, I will play with my dog.

He is working, managing a big respectable firm, owned by brothers Mortimer Duke (Ameche) and Randolph Duke (Bellamy). Winthopre's salary is good, he has a great home, including personal butler Coleman (Elliott), he is member of a prestigious club and he is about to marry. Life couldn't be better. On the other side of the community is Billy Ray Valentine (Murphy). He is making his living as a fake Vietnam veteran begging for money and frequently has trouble with the police. The Dukes, beside their greatest interest, making money, is interested in science and social studies. They argue if environment or heritage determines an individual's outcome in life. When Valentine one day is arrested for assault, after accidentally bumping in to Winthorpe, the Dukes decide to make an experiment. They make bail for Valentine, give him a good home and clothes (Winthorpe's home and clothes) and put him in charge of their firm. On the other hand they frame Winthorpe, having him arrested as a thief and drug dealer. They kick him out of his job and home, have his assets frozen and destroys his marriage by hiring a hooker (Lee Curtis) that the claims to be Winthorpe's girlfriend in front of his fiancé. Now the Dukes want to see if Valentine can thrive and if Winthorpe will resort to violence and crime.Comments This is somewhat of a classic movie with a stellar cast. The story is well thought through, there are no obvious plot holes. And it is funny and entertaining, even if both Aykroyd and Murphy have been better, they are somewhat restrained by the story. However there are some glances of their comic greatness, and as mentioned, the story is not bad at all. Other cast is good as well even their roles are only supporting the two main characters. But I did like Elliott as the butler Coleman, managing being both butlerish graceful and funny at the same time. Also James Belushi has a small but funny part. There is also a small social comment in this movie if one wants to look at it that way. It does not interfere with the comedy though, in fact it is in part the basis of it, and if you want to, you could possibly ignore it and just sit back and enjoy (and think about it some other time).7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 March 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" ** HERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS ** Recap Louis Winthorpe III (Aykroyd) is on the top of the world.
