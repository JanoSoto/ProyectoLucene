[{"date":"14 September 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Rushomre, the second film written and directed by Wes Anderson, but the first to really establish his style, comes across as a breathe of fresh air. The detail that is put into this film alone gives Anderson the aptitude to be one of the greatest filmmakers of his generation. Each character has their own idiosyncrasies that are both bizarre and believable. The main character Max Fischer, played by the then fresh face, Jason Scwartzman is masterfully written in Andersons screenplay. His every movement, the clothing he wears, the music he listens to, everything about him makes this character unforgettable. This film also marks the beginning of the serious Bill Murray, who plays an unhappy, middle-aged millionaire who seems to want and lack the same things Fischer himself strives to attain. Both characters although different in many ways have the same problems, and even though they work against each other throughout the course of the story, end up realizing they are more alike then they anticipated. The dry, and sometimes caustic humor in this film is priceless. Anderson knows exactly how to time a joke, both through its delivery and the cinematography itself. Almost a masterpiece Rushmore is Andersons Pulp Fiction and greatest piece to date. Rushmore not only spawned a rush of similar films (The Squid and the Whale, Little Miss Sunshine, etc. ) but perfected it at its early stage.
