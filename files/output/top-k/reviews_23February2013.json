The reason for this? Well, I just never got around to it, despite having heard all the good things about this movie.And now that I have seen it, I must say that this movie really wasn't one that stood out that much in my opinion. The movie just didn't leave that much of a lasting impression on me. Sure there were some really great scenes and some good ideas put to the screen, but overall the two stories told here were not just exceptional. The first story with the drug trafficking ring came off as too hastily put together, because there weren't any satisfactory ending to it, in my opinion. Whereas the second story with the police officer and the waitress turned out to be much more appealing for me, as it was funnier and had a more coherent red thread throughout its course.Chungking Express is not the type of Hong Kong movie that will appeal just to anyone, it certainly didn't sit all that well with me, and I must admit that I have seen many more movies from Hong Kong that far outshines this one.I am not saying that Chungking Express is a bad movie, far from it. It is just different - story-wise, that is.As for the cinematography, well then they really did a good job here. The camera-work and the angles of the shots were just superb, and there was a very dynamic feel to the scenes in both the stories.Which leaves me to comment on the acting. As a fan of Tony Leung, I must admit that the appeal to the second story had a big part of him being in it, as he always do great jobs with the movies he is in. But also noteworthy here was Faye Wong - also in the second story. Personally, I have never understood the hype about Brigette Lin, but hey, a matter a personal preference, I suppose. It was a bit strange to see Takeshi Kaneshiro in this movie, but he did a good job with his given character.To me, Chungking Express was a fairly mediocre movie, though it did impress on the visual side, but it doesn't really stand out for me in an otherwise overwhelming market of Hong Kong movies out there. Hence I am giving it a 5\/10 rating only.

You must strive to find your own voice because the longer you wait to begin, the less likely you are going to find it at all. I stand upon my desk to remind myself that we must constantly look at things in a different way. These inspirational quotes from Peter Weir's drama Dead Poets Society best sum up what this film is all about. It's a film that any student currently in high school or college will probably appreciate immensely due to the main ideas it shares with them. It's also a film that inspires us to live our lives in a way that better satisfies our dreams and desires. Dead Poets Society follows a group of students (Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke chief among them) in their senior year at an all-male Vermont prep school led by a strict headmaster (Norman Lloyd) who wants to maintain tradition, honor, discipline and excellence in the school as much as possible. He makes the students recite this phrase about the school's four main principles on a daily basis. He assigns the students work that's either overwhelming, discouraging, or doesn't make much sense. The students are hardly even allowed to go off campus. Talk about a prison like lifestyle at that place. These students are just plugging away trying to get good grades to move on from Welton Academy and go on with their lives. But when this group of students attend an English class with a teacher (Robin Williams) whose teaching methods are unorthodox by Welton standards and whose life morals to the students are very profound, they become influenced and inspired by his lessons to the point where they incorporate his advice into their own lives. One of the students (Leonard) uses this advice in his own life by becoming an actor despite his father's (Kurtwood Smith) disapproval.The performances from the students in general are pretty decent since I bought them being completely entranced by what the teacher teaches them and I also believed that they were learning from what they have been taught. Speaking of the teacher, Robin Williams also turns in a solid dramatic performance as the insightful teacher. Even though we don't know for sure how he came to obtain this knowledge, whatever he's teaching his students sounds like very good life skills. What really makes Dead Poets Society special though is what it teaches the audience. After seeing this movie, some people may no longer like being in strict, conventional environments such as school again. Some people may want to pursue careers that personally make them content with their lives. So I guess you could say this film will leave an impact of some sort to anyone who watches it. While the characters played by Norman Lloyd and Kurtwood Smith were sort of meant to be antagonist roles, I felt no sympathy for either character at all. In fact, the screenplay succeeds all too well at making these two characters so hateful and unpleasant to the point where you just want to punch them in the face for causing you so much hatred. The reason why these two characters bother me is because they're simply being jerks without having any motivations behind their actions whatsoever. There are also similar characters that are in this picture that are just so hateful and bossy that you just can't stand being in their presence. I forgot to mention that these students secretly revive a literary club called the Dead Poets Society (hence the reason for the film's title) in which the teacher used to be a part of when he was a student at Welton. They attend these meetings in a cave off campus where they read poetry and writings and what not. I thought that these meetings didn't really work that well for my taste since I simply thought they were a little too weird. Overall, the reason why Dead Poets Society is worth one viewing is because of the message it tells its audience regarding how to better live your life. As I've stated earlier, the group of people that will be most affected by this film, for better or worse, is definitely high school and college students. I feel like this is the demographic that will most likely take these theories to heart and use them every day of their lives especially during their rebellion state.

Since his dad (Kevin McCarthy) is stubbornly determined to make his son go to Yale and study international law, the course must be passed. So the dad hires a live-in tutor, Terry Green (the lovely Ms. Kaye) to instruct the boy for the summer. What the virginal Bobby doesn't expect is to fall in love with the young lady. While My Tutor isn't as raunchy as some viewers may hope, it does have its entertaining farcical moments here and there, many of them courtesy of co-star Crispin Glover, as Jack, one of Bobby's two buds who accompany him on the quest to experience sex. It's quite a hoot to see Glover strapped to a big wheel by a whip wielding dominatrix; also early on in the picture Bobby is paired with an extremely well endowed prostitute (Kitten Natividad, whose main assets can be seen in all their glory.) But providing a solid anchor for the movie is the portrayal of the evolving relationship between tutor and student, and it's beautifully played by Kaye and Lattanzi. Adding to the appeal of My Tutor is its obvious made-in-the-80s feel, complete with upbeat theme song. The actors are all good, with Arlene Golonka playing Bobby's mom, Jewel Shepard (The Return of the Living Dead) as the sexy phone booth girl, and future director Katt Shea as one of the mud wrestlers. One subplot with Terry's stuck up former boyfriend (Bruce Bauer) trying to worm his way back into her life does have a mildly entertaining payoff, but one has to wonder why another story thread - that of finding out that the Chrystals' hired help have been putting on an act - was created, as it never really goes anywhere. By the end, we can't help but feel good for Bobby when he finally decides to stand up to his dad and vow to go ahead and study astronomy at UCLA, which is what he really wants to do.

People say it should be called 'the Native American in the cupboard'. This is a very very common misconception in America. Yes, for a while they were called Indians. Christopher Columbus did not call them Indians because he thought they were from India. He called them Gods people. The word in his language for God's people sounds very similar to the word Indian that we use today. It's just that the pronunciation we use now has changed a little after all this time. As for people saying that the correct term is Native American is highly offensive and frankly kind of stupid. How is it that taking the name from which the conquerors's gave them(American) supposed to be the correct term? That makes absolutely no sense. The word American has no relation whatsoever to Indian culture. Therefore Native American is utterly ridiculous, as well. If there is to be a title, it's should be call 'The Iroquois in the Cupboard'. No matter, what it is, call. The movie and book is not racist. The movie and book is trying to show tolerance through it's metaphor for how ignorant people have subjugated and marginalized the Indian populations of America by refusing to understand, listen to, or accommodate Indian heritage. The film opens up, a lot of things that people rarely knew about Native Americans. The film starts with a young boy, Omri (Hal Scardino), receives a cupboard. He uses a magical key, which belonged to his great-grandmother, to bring a plastic 18th century Native American figurine to life with the cupboard. The now-living Iroquois reveals his name as Little Bear (Litefoot). Litefoot, a real rapper does a great job in teaching role, not only in teaching the child about Iroquois's culture, but also the morality of playing God. There is a Frankenstein feel to the film. My favorite line in the film God does play with little men'. Author Lynne Reid Banks and Director Frank Oz did an excellent job conveying the worry and angst the young boy felt for for his little toy come to life. I appreciate how the author had the boy evolve from seeing the Indian as a plaything to realizing that, regardless of his size, the Indian was a person with needs, feelings, and a right to live his life. What struck me about it was not that it was racist, or dated (it didn't feel so as much as you'd think,) but that it is a deconstruction of the idea that magical toys would be fun to have, and possibly of imagination as well. Omri seem just the typical kid protagonist, kinda generic if you ask me. But I still think his acting was unintentionally funny. Just weird out with all the close ups on Omri's face, the odd relationship between him and Little Bear, the weird fears, and how he reacts to others. Examples when Omri's dad confronts him about the saw blades, and Omri says he buried them. Odd lying by him and his parent accept that lame excuse. What kid can cuss to his mom as well? What is with his relationship with brothers being super cool in the beginning of the film and then for no reason Omri turns into a complete jerk with him? The worst thing, the kid does is abuse an animal. That poor thing was abused through the whole film. Whether it was real or not, it was still animal abuse and shouldn't be shown in this movie. The treatment of that rat was appalling. Omri still wasn't nearly as annoying as his friend, Patrick. One minute he's Omri's best friend, and all docile and quiet, and then like a switch, he's evil and defiant with seeing them as nothing more than animated toys. He brings in Boone (David Keith), a bigot Injun hating cowboy whom at first conflict with Little Bear, but grows to be friends with him, once they got to know each other. One of the odd things about the film is scenes that go nowhere or has nothing to do with the story like the Mohawk bully. Another thing is the degrading of women in the film, from the kids watching Montley Crue 'Girls' music video (it's the 1990's, why were they watching it anyways?) to Bear demanding a wife so she can cook. I put aside my critiques and squelched my inner squirming and found much to like about the film. The special effects were top notch, and it was really neat to see Little Bear, Boone and Tommy (Steve Coogan) the medic brought to life on the screen. It was pretty cool to see the Star Wars, Jurrasic Park, G.I Joe, and Robo-Cop reference. The movie is pretty close to the book, minus little changes such as the toy shop. I laugh at the kid that loves JFK. While the movie isn't that bad, it's not going to hurt the kids watching it. I like it when I was a kid and still kinda do.

And, while these are undoubtedly in the discussion, and one can say that Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock are certainly in the top 10 best directors in history, neither of these are the best movie of all time.CITIZEN KANE is an epic piece of semi-fiction clustered around the life and times of Hearst, McCormick, Insull and a few others. This film broke ground in so many technical ways--flashbacks as the primary source of telling a story, multiple narrators, deep focus shots, intense shadows and lighting effects, and camera angles shot from the floor at times. Also, this was probably the most highly controversial film ever made, since William Randolph Hearst tried furiously to snuff it out, and Hollywood moguls approached Orson Welles and RKO Productions to reimburse him for the costs of the film just to simply destroy it. However, although CITIZEN KANE might be the most innovative film of all time (save for the first motion picture, the first color motion picture, and the first with sound), it is not the best picture or all time. This is largely because the story is quite dated, and almost no one can connect with a newspaper mogul in today's society. Sure there are enduring themes here, but ultimately this picture doesn't have the soul to grab us as viewers and pull us in.Without going into similar detail for VERTIGO, suffice it to say that this is another picture that is technically revolutionary (Vertigo effect), but the story just doesn't have the level of humanity and soul that one would expect for best movie ever.Two other pictures that are commonly viewed as contenders include IMDb's own #1 THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION as well as IMDb #2 THE GODFATHER. And while these movies are much more soulful story-wise than VERTIGO or CITIZEN KANE, neither rises quite to the level of technical brilliance exhibited by the other films.So, there appears to be a quandary at the top of the movie hierarchy, where we have two brilliant, technical masterpieces that don't have quite enough soul, and we also have two brilliant cinematic masterpieces that might not be as technically\/visually stunning as one would expect from the best movie ever.Enter SCHINDLER'S LIST.SCHINDLER'S LIST is a movie that, although it is comfortably amongst the top movies on IMDb (#8 currently), no one ever seriously mentions it for best movie. And this is really a crime, because it deserves that title, and is by far Spielberg's best work.The acting is A++ in this movie--what we have is Liam Neeson, possibly the most underrated actor of the last quarter century, delivering his finest performance as protagonist Oskar Schindler. Alongside this performance, is Ralph Fiennes also giving his finest career performance as antagonist Amon Goethe. There is not a single line spoken, nor facial gesture made, nor flourish with a prop (cigarette, shot glass, deck of cards) that is anything short of mind-blowing. The scene between Schindler and Goethe discussing the difference between power and justice, with power coming the ability to not exercise that very power, or make a pardon, was phenomenal. And then Goethe's being so influenced that he becomes obsessed with trying on that version of power for size before ultimately discarding it was haunting. Aspiring actors be on notice, this movie can teach you to win an Oskar (intentionally misspelled) someday. Ben Kingsley fills his role sublimely as the necessary cog in the Schindler machine (and ultimately the one who goads Schindler into realizing there is more than business at stake), Itzhak Stern. Additionally, casting European and Jewish actors and actresses only makes this tale that much fuller with realism and soul.The sound, music, and cinematography is simply on another level, and this is what sets it apart from THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and THE GODFATHER. Seeing Krakow from a distance at night, with machine gun fire intermittently lighting up rooms with murders was extremely effective, as were all the set pieces that showed intricate hiding places and how the Nazis had come to use stethoscopes to defeat this Jewish strategy. The cat and mouse game between hunter and hunted was very well done. What's more, the emaciated bodies of people who played some of these roles looked like they were actually taken out of Holocaust footage. It was disturbing and stunning all at once. Throw in an AMAZING, beautiful, and tragic score with superb sound editing, beautiful panoramic shots, and compelling grayscale to yield an artistic, audiovisual feast.As if to cement its status as best film ever, the attention to detail, the script, and the utter despair felt at every turn was breathtaking. You cannot help but be awe-struck at every horrified expression, every pained look, every exactly delivered line. Though this is a 3-hour-long epic, there is not a single extraneous line in the entire movie. There is not a single gratuitous scene. Every scene absolutely belongs, and every spoken line fits like a jigsaw puzzle.The mood of this film gives it soul, like you find in films such as CASABLANCA and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, but darker and haunted. This feeling just makes you want to root like hell that everyone makes it out unscathed. And when that train full of women is mistakenly sent to Auschwitz, a knot forms in your throat--so close, but yet so far from salvation. And, even Liam Neeson as Schindler is not immune, as he gives a bravura final performance where he weeps and questions the value of a life--could he have done more? It's become his sickness, his addiction, and though he did so much, it is certain not being able to turn his Nazi gold pin into even a single additional life will haunt him forever.

Sure there are enduring themes here, but ultimately this picture doesn't have the soul to grab us as viewers and pull us in.Without going into similar detail for VERTIGO, suffice it to say that this is another picture that is technically revolutionary (Vertigo effect), but the story just doesn't have the level of humanity and soul that one would expect for best movie ever.Two other pictures that are commonly viewed as contenders include IMDb's own #1 THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION as well as IMDb #2 THE GODFATHER. And while these movies are much more soulful story-wise than VERTIGO or CITIZEN KANE, neither rises quite to the level of technical brilliance exhibited by the other films.So, there appears to be a quandary at the top of the movie hierarchy, where we have two brilliant, technical masterpieces that don't have quite enough soul, and we also have two brilliant cinematic masterpieces that might not be as technically\/visually stunning as one would expect from the best movie ever.Enter SCHINDLER'S LIST.SCHINDLER'S LIST is a movie that, although it is comfortably amongst the top movies on IMDb (#8 currently), no one ever seriously mentions it for best movie. And this is really a crime, because it deserves that title, and is by far Spielberg's best work.The acting is A++ in this movie--what we have is Liam Neeson, possibly the most underrated actor of the last quarter century, delivering his finest performance as protagonist Oskar Schindler. Alongside this performance, is Ralph Fiennes also giving his finest career performance as antagonist Amon Goethe. There is not a single line spoken, nor facial gesture made, nor flourish with a prop (cigarette, shot glass, deck of cards) that is anything short of mind-blowing. The scene between Schindler and Goethe discussing the difference between power and justice, with power coming the ability to not exercise that very power, or make a pardon, was phenomenal. And then Goethe's being so influenced that he becomes obsessed with trying on that version of power for size before ultimately discarding it was haunting. Aspiring actors be on notice, this movie can teach you to win an Oskar (intentionally misspelled) someday. Ben Kingsley fills his role sublimely as the necessary cog in the Schindler machine (and ultimately the one who goads Schindler into realizing there is more than business at stake), Itzhak Stern. Additionally, casting European and Jewish actors and actresses only makes this tale that much fuller with realism and soul.The sound, music, and cinematography is simply on another level, and this is what sets it apart from THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and THE GODFATHER. Seeing Krakow from a distance at night, with machine gun fire intermittently lighting up rooms with murders was extremely effective, as were all the set pieces that showed intricate hiding places and how the Nazis had come to use stethoscopes to defeat this Jewish strategy. The cat and mouse game between hunter and hunted was very well done. What's more, the emaciated bodies of people who played some of these roles looked like they were actually taken out of Holocaust footage. It was disturbing and stunning all at once. Throw in an AMAZING, beautiful, and tragic score with superb sound editing, beautiful panoramic shots, and compelling grayscale to yield an artistic, audiovisual feast.As if to cement its status as best film ever, the attention to detail, the script, and the utter despair felt at every turn was breathtaking. You cannot help but be awe-struck at every horrified expression, every pained look, every exactly delivered line. Though this is a 3-hour-long epic, there is not a single extraneous line in the entire movie. There is not a single gratuitous scene. Every scene absolutely belongs, and every spoken line fits like a jigsaw puzzle.The mood of this film gives it soul, like you find in films such as CASABLANCA and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, but darker and haunted. This feeling just makes you want to root like hell that everyone makes it out unscathed. And when that train full of women is mistakenly sent to Auschwitz, a knot forms in your throat--so close, but yet so far from salvation. And, even Liam Neeson as Schindler is not immune, as he gives a bravura final performance where he weeps and questions the value of a life--could he have done more? It's become his sickness, his addiction, and though he did so much, it is certain not being able to turn his Nazi gold pin into even a single additional life will haunt him forever.

It was supposed to be a gem of American cinematography -- instead, what we've got here is a failure to enjoy even a few minutes of it. I'm sorry, but the direction seemed particularly weak to me -- and only afterwards, I learned that this was Stuart Rosenberg's directorial debut. Oh heavens, but it showed! It took me literally four attempts to get through this turgid movie; it couldn't possibly be moving slower; there is no clear narrative line -- only disjointed episodes, and once you've seen the first 5 of them, you know that the remaining two dozen or so will be just more of the same.This movie is affectation from start to finish. Sorry, I did not see it as realistic -- rather, as a movie *playing a game* called Let's be brutally realistic. But that's exactly what's wrong you can see, the whole time, that this is just a movie *affecting* realism. The actors appearing here, led by the super-handsome Paul Newman, are *not* real prisoners. Sorry, but they're just too clean-cut, their hairstyles are more admirable than this reviewer's hairstyle has ever been... and when Paul Newman is supposed to look disheveled, you can see that it's just make-up artists at work.Imagine an ugly actor playing the part of Luke -- would this movie have been such a huge hit? I'm certain it wouldn't; Newman carries the movie on his shoulders, with his boyish charm, yet he is just as affected as everyone else.The most annoying character, to me, was the one played by George Kennedy. Sorry, I couldn't picture Kennedy as a real prisoner for a single minute. He was an *actor* playing a prisoner -- that's all. I just didn't buy his portrayal and couldn't buy it, no matter how much I strove to suspend my disbelief. Awarding an Oscar for such a histrionic performance is something I can't possibly fathom -- perhaps, as sometimes happens with Oscars, it was awarded to Kennedy as a summary appreciation for all of his work in all his other previous movies.There is no doubt that _Cool Hand Luke_ features lots of great actors -- so the blame for the movie's failure to impress must be assigned to the director. It's primarily the director's job to ensure that actors don't fall into that trap of appearing to be just theatrical actors, not real persons.Don't get me wrong it wasn't the movie's unsavory milieu that put me off. Although I'm no fan of prison movies, I have great regard for a true classic like _The Shawshank Redemption_; I also quite enjoyed Stanley Kramer's similarly themed (prison escape) _The Defiant Ones_, or _The Green Mile_ with Tom Hanks. But no matter how much I tried, and how much I appreciate Paul Newman as an actor, I just couldn't enjoy _Cool Hand Luke_ one bit.Oh yes, _Cool Hand Luke_ features a classic quotation about the failure to communicate -- but one such catchphrase is not enough to rescue such a monumental bore of 2 hours' length. If one wished to be sarcastic, one might say the catchphrase is so good because, as the screenwriter admitted, it appeared subconsciously in his mind as he was writing the script -- without him intending to use the phrase at all. Seeing as those things that the movie's creators apparently *did* intend to accomplish, didn't pan out, it's probably good he did not intend to create a classic catchphrase -- because that conscious intention would probably have misfired like the rest of the movie.

All this is very enjoyable and as a love story I really enjoyed the film. I was also very impressed by the quality of most of the script. In particular there are some quite wonderful sequences which intercut scenes from Romeo and Juliet as it is performed and the interactions between the characters in the film. Many of these scenes were masterfully handled (or should that be personfully these days?). It reminded me very much of scenes from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead so I wasn't surprised at all to see that Tom Stoppard was one of the scriptwriters. In fact I assume Stoppard was responsible for the best parts of the script though I may be wrong about that.It was odd to see both Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes playing in virtually the same costumes that they had worn in Elizabeth. Both play excellently as does Ben Affleck (making some amends for that truly dreadful Will Hunting abomination) and Gwyneth Paltrow as the object of Shakespeare's affection. Personally I found it hard to see Paltrow as Juliet but she is an excellent actress. In fact everyone in the film acts their socks off and it would be difficult to find fault with them.An excellent film based on what I've said so far then. But there are unfortunately quite significant problems with it and they reside almost entirely with the comedic aspects of the script. Throughout the film, but especially in the first third of it, there are a series of jokes that would be rejected for a Carry On film. If I tell you that one of the better comic lines is Follow that boat then you will get the idea. The jokes are also anachronistic in the way that the language used in Xena, Warrior Princess is California-speak transplanted to ancient Greece. But it works in Xena because it is done to the Max. In this film it hardly ever works because the jokes are in modern parlance whilst the rest of the script is written with proper regard to the nuances of the language of the time. The fact that there are so many actors from British TV comedies is also very distracting for a British audience because you are never sure when they are supposed to be taken seriously or when they are working up to another weak joke.I have no doubt whatsoever that this film would have been improved by playing it as a straightforward historical romance and dropping the anachronistic jokes. This does not mean that funny scenes are not allowed but simply that it IS difficult to have your cake and eat it. I really enjoyed the film but the jarring switches between ancient and modern spoiled it for me and are wholly responsible for me knocking at least one star off of my rating.A nearly brilliant film spoiled by alleged comic interludes.

Because of similarities in their style and method, the two films have been pinned together as rival sister movies ever since their releases and have been compared and compressed time over time by film geeks and scholars alike. That Tarkovsky and Kubrick were both such meticulous (and successful) visionaries in their art direction and scene construction connects the two films more than anything. The main difference is that where 2001 A Space Odyssey is an external peer into the unknown unattainable answers of existence, as spacious and cerebral as it is, Solaris is an internal drama at its core and the connection it builds us with its characters drives the mystery it presents.The film begins with Kris, a researcher\/psychologist spending his last day on Earth before embarking on an interstellar mission to the distant and foreign planet Solaris, wandering through the wilderness deep in thought. His troubled mind is reminded of the news that all scientists and personnel who have attempted to examine the planet Solaris have succumbed to psychotic episodes and hallucinations. A friend and former exploratory pilot visits Kris to convince him that his hallucinations were real, and were product or creation of the planet. All this does is further compel Kris to his mission to assess the current scientists aboard the Solaris space station and determine whether it is reasonable or even possible to continue research. After burning his possessions and keepsakes and having an intimate conversation with his father, Kris closes his life on Earth and departs for space.Upon arrival at the space station, Kris enters to find that one of the scientists, his liaison and friend, has committed suicide and the remaining two scientists are shadowed by apparitions of people from their former lives (coyly referred to as guests). The message left to Kris from his deceased friend is that the planet can read minds and would copy and deliver people out of personal memories to those who were near to it. Soon enough Kris is met with his own guest, a replicate of his dead wife, Hari, who appears and acts like Hari but has no knowledge or memory of what she is; with no other anchors, she is attaches herself to Kris.Up to this point and through to the end, what little the film is able to cast in its philosophical glare it exceeds with in environment and internal struggle. The contrast between the settings of Earth and the spaceship are frightening in their scope. Shots of Earth show a flowing, natural beauty of familiar comfort reeds flowing through a river, rain dripping through the trees and wind rustling through the fields, a cozy lived-in home, animals&#x85;. The ship is like a cold, aesthetic Soviet version of a Jetsons prison with sparse, anarchic hallways and either empty or cluttered rooms. In one scene a remaining crewman shows Kris that he can cut a piece of paper into strips and put it over an air vent so that it can mimic the sound of rustling leaves. A loose, dripping pipe is the closest substitute to rain. Kurosawa, after a private screening with Tarkovsky, turned to him and said It's very good. It's a frightening movie. I can see where he is coming from with the movie's presentation of space life in and of itself.Aboard this bleak, exotic space station, Kris must come to terms with his guest, the closest substitute to his wife he can perceive, a product of his mind that cannot leave him and cannot die. If he allows her existence become a reality, what becomes of the memory of his dead wife and how, with this reality, can he differentiate a copied fabrication of someone from who they are truly representing? These are burdensome questions that story cannot answer but the characters continually meditate on. The film's final scene gives an even greater prescience to these questions and meditations.Tarkovsky's restraint in probing the film's preternatural centerpiece gives the movie a lofty, cerebral air, but holding back its mystery was also likely a necessity to pass the Soviet censors. After the back and forth censoring disputes of Tarkovsky's previous film, Andrei Rublev, causing the film to be suppressed nationally and internationally for years, Soviets footed that Tarkovsky remove the concept of God from Solaris entirely. Considering the stakes of a gargantuan production budget it's a wonder that Tarkovsky was even able to pen the script at all without the censor flaring their noses. With careful writing, Tarkovsky avoids the question of creation and being of these strange, familiar human apparitions and instead uses their existence to probe the mind and condition of them and their hosts. In the film we see Kris evolve a relationship with this strange being who for all disbelieving is his wife Hari, and in turn we see Hari, who has no connection to who Kris's wife is, only that she must be her, face the limits of her own identity.Near the beginning of the movie we see the former exploratory pilot ruminating in the back of his private car on a freeway after showing Kris the hearing of his Solaris experience. There is no dialogue, only abstract, minimal sound effects of streets noises and footage of highway to accompany his stark, searching eyes. The scene is approximately 7 minutes long. If you find yourself considering and pondering the positions of these characters and the consequences of their situations, the movie's space is rich and spiritual; however if you find nothing to ruminate on, it's likely that you will find Solaris a lengthy, tedious streak of long shots and sparse dialogue with very little payoff.

This is really a terrible film on the whole though it does have a few redeeming features, so let's look at them first.The claustrophobia of being locked up in a tin can at the bottom of the sea is invoked very convincingly, much better than the Abyss or old episodes of Stingray. Sharon Stone does play against type and does well considering the material. The opening sequence and the military involvement are handled quite well. The score is very effective even though it's highly derivative of the music from Aliens.On the other hand&#x85;.. the plot is awful, Dustin Hoffman plays Dustin Hoffman character-acting a mad psychologist, the effects are truly crappy for 1998, the monsters aren't very monstrous, the ending is naff, the colour is weird and grainy (OK, maybe that's deliberate but I didn't like it). And that's just for starters. Oh yes, you might want to know what it's about. Let me just say spacecraft at bottom of the sea, crack team of experts in something or other, storms at sea, lost contact with the surface ship, paranoia, death and the effects of a long-finished relationship.

This film is actually a cheap rate version of Forbidden Planet. Solaris was a very subtle exploration of how human psychology can be affected by alien intelligence. Forbidden Planet was about monsters from the id. Sphere is somewhat less satisfying than Forbidden Planet because the latter had robots, romance and good special effects even though it was made decades earlier. And I think my friend the Cheshire Cat has stopped speaking to me because it was my idea to go and see Sphere in the first place.

I can understand the many reasons behind giving the film a second chance it was an unprecedented box office failure when it first came out in 1980; the critics at the time, lead by the great Vincent Canby of the New York Times, tore it to ribbons; the director, Michael Cimino, before proclaimed as one of the most promising of New Hollywood directors, has had next to nothing for a career in movie-making since; there's a lot of famous actors in the movie, two of whom are making their feature-length debut; and it's based on a true event.And on top of that, who wouldn't want to like it? Apart from the obvious (only the world's biggest cynic wouldn't want to enjoy a movie that runs 216 minutes), Heaven's Gate is a big, blustery epic. I happen to love big, blustery epics, especially ones set in the Old West. Now Michael Cimino, it goes without saying, did not want to make one of the biggest box office and critical flops of all time; he just wanted to tell a fictionalized account of the Johnson County War. But his film is insipidly tedious and incoherent, and every passing minute is more unendurably soulless than the one that comes before it.There is a vast, grand-scale vision, to the point where Cimino almost seems to have been shy about photographing a close-up of anyone or anything. And sometimes the camera does move in ways that are undeniably interesting&#x97;sweeping up and over a laundry line of bed sheets to reveal homesteaders as they finish butchering a cow. There's also a shot in the second half which recalls the haunting moment in Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai when the bandits came flooding over the hilltops. Kurosawa's picture&#x97;which did not have the timely advantage of a wide-angle lens, by the way&#x97;also ran just under four hours in length, but was constantly moving, even in its quieter moments. Each scene had a purpose and appropriately wrapped itself up as needed, not as in the case of Heaven's Gate, where ninety percent of the concluding shots consist of two people sitting in a room, looking either off-screen or at their toes. Also not in service is the photography, which is filled with so much visual dust that it looks as though the camera and the set had been separated by a dirty window.Maybe Cimino's idea for the dramatic scenes was to mimic another great Japanese director, Yasujiro Ozu. Here, the camera hardly ever moves; the static shots linger on too long and pile on top of one another with no particular style or rhythm. And in many of these interior-set, would-be dramatic scenes, in which characters just repeat points they made clear many times before, I think I came to better understand Vincent Canby's review, in which he compared the film's unrelenting boredom to a four-hour tour of a living room. Some of these scenes do feel that long, and we are frequently just staring at&#x97;guess what?&#x97;a room. The Academy Award-nominated art direction is authentically detailed and good-looking, but even the prettiest picture can lose its interest after a while.The cast of Heaven's Gate is rich with talent, but only one man has a good part to act, and that's the underrated Sam Waterston, virtually unrecognizable compared to his now-famous district attorney in Law & Order, this time playing a cruel land commissioner. Everybody else is stiff like a corpse and packed with mawkish emotion. The would-be love triangle between Kris Kristofferson and Christopher Walken&#x97;playing enforcers on opposite sides of the law&#x97;and an immigrant prostitute portrayed by Isabelle Huppert is utilized with no apparent motive except to tell us that a man and a woman, even if they come from different parts of the world, can fall in love. Any intelligent person from the 20th or 21st century already knows that. The point is obvious, so why not instill this dynamic with so passion? When Kristofferson and Huppert fondle and kiss in their first moment together, it feels forced; the actors seem outside their comfort zones. They don't really seem warm and affectionate, or even erotic, toward one another.John Hurt's also in the movie, playing a dimmer version of his usual wisecracking philosopher. But all of these people have no interest with one another, and yet so much of the story focuses on two or three folks just whispering to one another in an enclosed space. Now when the battles between the homesteaders and the mercenaries begin, Cimino promises some exciting action. The first bit&#x97;where an innocent man is brutally murdered&#x97;is excellently handled. The Foley, in particular, is marvelous. But each of the three subsequent violent sequences is less exhilarating the one before it, not helped in the least by the 10-20 minutes of drippy melodrama stuffed in between.Heaven's Gate is not one of the worst movies ever made, but it is awfully tempting, for me, to call it just that. For 216 minutes, it left me writhing with boredom and frustration, only occasionally interested. I can forgive the movie's pointless prologue of a beginning, for it does feature what is probably the best scene set to the Blue Danube waltz since 2001 A Space Odyssey. But the ending, which is factually much shorter but seems so much longer, is an incoherent and confusing fiasco. As is much of what happens in the middle. So, no, the movie is not particularly worth rediscovering as far as I am concerned. Yes, Michael Cimino is a brilliant talent, and he deserved a better chance to redeem himself. But that's no excuse for mislabeling one of the clunkiest pictures ever made as a masterpiece.
