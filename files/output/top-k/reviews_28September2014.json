He sticks to drama-thrillers but does it so well. Panic Room has a simple premise but is executed unbelievably well. It's also for the most part well acted and the last 20 minutes or so is a true cinematic thrill ride. Out of a home invasion film, Panic Room gives just about as much as you would want.All the colors throughout the house signal Fincher's style. He uses almost all grey, black, and hints of dark blue. He sets the tone in the opening credits with Howard Shore's haunting score playing, and promises quite a ride. At first, it seemed to have all the clichés from past films. She doesn't set up the phone, the child has a medical problem, she turns away just as the robber is passing her room, and also the fact that they rob the house on the first day they buy it. With that being said it gets away from clichés and brings us a nail biting invasion film. Forest Whitaker is a big reason why Panic Room will stick with me for awhile. He plays the intruder who is torn between staying for the money or leaving to ensure the family is safe. He's the best character by far and overshadowed even the great Jared Leto and Jodie Foster. Even Kristen Stewart impressed me with her acting in the supporting role as the child.I really liked the few twists and turns it took near the end. I always like a film that keeps me on the edge of my toes and makes me believe that the main characters could be in danger. If anything this film can give someone a few tips on how to handle an invasion, that is if your house is a mansion with like 5 floors and a panic room. I'm not sure why this film gets all the hate or just lack of love. Sure it's not a complicated plot and sure it doesn't have the shock value of Se7en or Fight Club, but it's still a well directed movie with some great performances. But I will say that I did not like Dwight Yoakam's performance. Partially due to them writing him as the prototypical villain.Panic Room also has a high re-watchability factor. It's not a long film and the 2 hours fly by. It's one of those movies that you don't go out of your way to see, but when it's on, you keep it on. So far, Fincher hasn't made a bad film. In fact, I think his worst movie is The Game which is still a solid film. I look forward to THIS WEEK's Gone Girl to see what else he brings to the mystery-thriller-crime-drama genres.+Fincher's style written all over it +Whitaker's performance +Intense and unique in some aspects +Re-Watchable -Cliché filled -Yoakam was a weak villain 8.0\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 September 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" David Fincher is simply one of the finest directors to ever live.

This movie also made my brain hurt, so it might just be residual pain flowing through the optic nerve.This movie might be the very last moment when someone working on material from a comic book thought that comics should always be first and foremost comical. The end result here is a mess that doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.Maybe they were going for the camp appeal of the 60's Batman? Who knows, but this certainly had none of the fun. The moments where this film attempts to be funny are easily distinguished, and the viewer usually notes this with a groan or a sigh. Yes, one-liners are an important part of such comic hero action AND an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, but spewing them out at such machine gun rate lessens their intended punch to utter minimum. Also, making a cartoony film with such high levels of threat of sex does make one wonder who was this film really aimed at?My main concern here is, however, that this film, that was to be the last of the series, is plagued by the same fault that had me groaning quite some during The Dark Knight Rises, another last of it's series. What brought both films toppling down for me was the decision to keep upping the ante to unrealistic heights, which leads to a moment in the film where we've gone so over the top that we can't even see the top we were supposed to go over; where tension is to be built in a fashion that resembles more a joyride in an amusement park - a cart rolling on it's set tracks - instead of the often surprising organic escalation of action; where such jumble of set-ups are in place that no conclusion can be truly satisfactory, resulting in either an anti-climatic thump or a slow sizzling out of energy, like helium leaking from a balloon.If a move away from the dark style set by Tim Burton in Batman and Batman Returns was what was wanted, there were so many things that could've been done to achieve it. In the Batman & Robin the changes undertaken were considerable, but ultimately left the movie and its' characters hollow. The only thing I felt watching this unfold was that maybe those responsible for this film didn't really care about the end result, but about all the details that went into making it all the costumes, the settings, the gadgets, the quotable one-liners...If that really was the case, I don't think it was worth leaving the audience with nothing else than pieces of glittery surface and form- fitted leather.

It also has a very strong supporting cast. Outside of the first scene, Winona Ryder does not appear until 40 minutes into the film but nevertheless makes for a great leading lady. Kim has a great character arc, going from being terrified of Edward to adoring him. In spite of the fact that this happens over quite a brief period of time, it nevertheless seems very believable due to both the excellent writing and Ryder's performance. Anthony Michael Hall, cast against his previous nice, skinny, nerd type in the John Hughes films, makes for a great villain as Jim. Dianne Wiest and Alan Arkin are excellent as Peg and Bill Boggs and I adored Vincent Prince's cameo as the Inventor, which sadly proved to be his final film appearance. The rest of the cast is very good as well, particularly Kathy Baker and Conchata Ferrell. Burton has a great eye for casting. I don't think that anyone in the film gives a bad performance. Actually, I think that is true of all of the five Burton films that I've watched recently except for Planet of the Apes.Part of the reason why I think that the film works so well is that Edward resembles the villain of one of the innumerable slasher films released during the 1980s. Burton and the screenwriter Caroline Thompson completely subvert the audience's expectations of Edward in that respect. Edward is such a compelling character because none of his problems are of his own making they are all as a result of lies, misunderstandings and accidents. They result in him being completely misjudged by the Boggs' neighbours and thereby call attention to the isolation and discrimination often experienced by those who are different. This sense of isolation is also helped by the contrast between Edward's appearance and the Inventor's dark, murky castle on the one hand and the vibrant yellows, greens, reds, blues and pinks of the neighbourhood on the other hand.

They result in him being completely misjudged by the Boggs' neighbours and thereby call attention to the isolation and discrimination often experienced by those who are different. This sense of isolation is also helped by the contrast between Edward's appearance and the Inventor's dark, murky castle on the one hand and the vibrant yellows, greens, reds, blues and pinks of the neighbourhood on the other hand.

They made several of these during and after World War II. It's a fun movie with cartoons of varying quality but none are bad. Many of these cartoons were released later as theatrical shorts. There are ten segments. The most popular of them is probably Casey at the Bat, a recitation by Jerry Colonna of the famous poem. It's a funny, wacky baseball cartoon that was one of my favorites as a kid (seen on a compilation video). Other well-known parts include the Disney version of Peter and the Wolf, The Martins and the Coys, which is now considered politically incorrect by those who make such determinations, and The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met, featuring Nelson Eddy. These are all fine cartoons, though the last one has a surprisingly downbeat ending. The 'worst' shorts are the ones that have no real story, just offer a few minutes of animation to some song, almost like a music video of sorts. Blue Bayou, Without You, and Two Silhouettes, for example. They aren't bad shorts, just slight. They feel like time filler. My two favorite shorts in the whole movie are All the Cats Join In and Johnnie Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet. 'Cats' is an energetic big band number with Benny Goodman music playing while a pencil draws the action as it happens. It's creative and cute with a surprisingly sexy part. You'll have to watch it to see what I mean. 'Fedora' is a sweet story about two hats (yes, hats) falling in love and becoming separated. This is narrated through song by the great Andrews Sisters. Overall, some nice little shorts that should please old-school Disney fans. Good animation and music. A very pleasant movie that will leave you with a smile on your face.

I got her autobiography (just her words transcribed from tape with little editing and flow) and thought I might find an interesting person in there. The Barefoot Contessa came on TV with me just at her chapter in the book on the movie. Little or no info about the production, which gives scant insight into how she felt, some but not enough to make it interesting. Mostly her struggles with the men in her life and drinking. Contessa is a silly tapestry of episodes with a central character of Maria Vargas (Gardner) beginning well, but becoming more and more ridiculous. You get the feeling the Joseph L. Mankiewicz picked up fragments of this from his life in Hollywood and beyond (there are references to a Howard Hughes type) and part of Rita Hayworth's real story,but where ever it sprang from it doesn't hold together well and none of the characters are that believable because of the tenuous thread. You can see Humphrey Bogart trying very hard and Ava Gardner is a knockout to look at and begins well as the Spanish girl dancer with humble beginnings, but then she just comes across as a stunningly beautiful vacuous idol that is determined to make mistake after mistake. I didn't mind the shared narration at all but a modern audience would not be able to deal with all those words, especially the heavy handed long winded explanations near the end. Could have done much of that with a few well held head shots of people thinking, as in the opening of the movie with intriguing shots of an audience watching a never seen Maria dance. Anyway, it looks good. Some great locations and great old cars.

Alice tells her kitten Dinah that she will live in a nonsensical land called Wonderland. After she daydreamed about it, she spot a rabbit called..White Rabbit, who's late for something that has to do with the Queen of Hearts's stuff or ceremony. Alice and her kitten follows the white rabbit and Alice goes inside the rabbit hole and falls into a place called (you guessed it) Wonderland. A place that's so weird that it's better not to explain it at all. (Spoilers!) However, all of this was just a dream from Alice, and she, Dinah, and her older sister just go went back home and it's obviously time for tea.The way they show Wonderland was very, and I mean very strange.

He could fly, but only because he was wearing a rocket pack, only this was not like any recent Batman film. There was a certain ease and finesse here that didn't go overboard in the telling of it. I don't think the creators of the Rocketeer would have Batman speaking almost unintelligible or have him destroying squad cars and rooftops.

But I feel like it was never fully followed through, it almost seems like they didn't know how to end this movie, how to tie it all together. The plot with the priest just fizzles out, the plot with the ghost on the child can see fizzles out, the idea that the husband is going to kill everyone fizzles out.. it just fizzles. It's just such a shame considering the possibilities. I also think it's overly long, and quite boring in some parts. There are a few jump scares early on but nothing spectacular. I kept waiting for things to get scary but most parts just seemed comical, like when the lead actor saw a ghost head of himself hovering in the cavity behind the wall in the basement. It even had a cheesy bit of music to go with it. I feel like maybe they were channeling some of the exorcist here with the priest plot lines, but it just didn't work. In the end, it was a totally unsatisfying movie, with a really weak ending. Having said that, I have to give it kudos for inspiring the movie makers of today, and I think modern horror is so much better for the ones that went before.

It started off the whole 'monster-munching' movie genre, where a lone creature stalks and eliminates a team\/crew\/whatever one by one. There have been countless B-movies made since its release in 1979 which have tried - unsuccessfully - recapture its look, feel and financial viability, but pretty much all have failed.Then you have the new generation - those who have grown up with 'Avatar' as the 'normal' quality of film. It's fair to say that Avatar is a vastly superior film to Alien, but only because it has the budget etc. If you're used to seeing thousands of alien creatures fighting over a mystical landscape, watching a single creature (which, as some times, comes across very much as a bloke in a suit) jump out of the darkness about five times in two hours, comes as a bit of a let-down.However, when it comes to purity, Alien will beat pretty much every movie ever made (even its highly-regarded successor, 'Aliens,' which - although also excellent, is not as pure as the original, as it blends genres more).If you know Alien and generally appreciate horror and\/or science-fiction, you'll probably already love it. However, if you're new to the genre and primarily are used to modern filming techniques, you may have to put yourself in the place of the audiences back in 1979, who had never seen such a claustrophobic and tense piece of horror.The xenomorph itself, now looking a little dated (in my opinion the dragon-thing at the end of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland looked more horrific!) may not cut it compared with modern special effects, but - again - it was way ahead of its time.

He was made out to be a boorish dolt and a slug when his real persona was just the opposite.

In my opinion, the first Halloween in a masterpiece and while imitated often, has never been equalled. The second one isn't bad, but this is presumably when the series went into stupidity. It isn't unwatchable. Technically, it's moderately efficient and a couple of chilling nightmares and a very clever scene involving multiple Michaels gave me the shivers, while Donald Pleasance is still excellent as Sam Loomis. The best scene of the film is when Loomis confronts Michael at a gas station, but sadly after that Loomis is underused, although Myers is still the boogyman and still a brilliant villain. The new main characters are good as well.What lets this down is its stupidity. It has multiple plot holes and one of the stupidest third acts of a horror film ever. Michael Myers disappears in front of Loomis in a split second. Michael's niece wanders off from her foster sister. Michael Myers turns up inside a house despite the fact that all the doors and windows are locked. A man tries to fight Michael by punching him in the face. Michael teleports from the roof of a house to the ground, then to a school and then onto a moving truck. Michael Myers turns into Kenny from South Park as he continuously survives everything. You get the idea. The film stops being scary after a while, and it just becomes monotonous and predictable. It's a shame because the film does start out well, but it then just descends into numbing stupidity and gaping plot holes. It's not a terrible film and it is a watchable one, but the film feels almost desperate to get its scares and there is a sense that the film is just a money grabber. Fans of the franchise will enjoy it as it is a good cinematic universe and delivers on the horror thrills, but I personally feel maybe it's time for Michael just to stay dead. Unfortunately, we've still got another 4 films to go before that might happen.4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 September 2014","score":"","review":" The Halloween franchise made a good move after the second film.
