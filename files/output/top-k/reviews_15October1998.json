It is based in Northern Ireland, so it will probably get a bad review from English viewers - who would be jealous of such a good film being made here.

Nearly 10 years on it still delivers. Tim Burton's Batman is a slick stylish movie that makes what could be argued as the best Comic (Superman, The Crow and Blade are contenders to that crown) to Film translation ever. Focussing on the dark and gritty themes framed beautifully by Tim Burton's eye for dark on lights. Michael Keaton who despite almost public outrage when picked to play Batman turns in what has been the best Batman portrayal from 3 other actors to try the cowl and cape.  Jack Nicholson as the Joker is evil and malevolent if not perhaps a tad over the top and Kim Bassinger doing Vicky Vale, a tool character, who is constantly in trouble and screams\/squeals at every given opportunity.  The movie is intelligent and forthright with its development, it progresses nicely with good pace and timing that is well suited to the feel of the film.  The movie doesn't play down to us too much and keeps it relatively simple to follow so it doesn't lose the younger viewers. Whilst keeping it gritty and the content adult oriented enough to keep the older members of the audience interested.  The sequels did not seem to keep to this mindset; they appeared to want the younger audience more.  I guess because you can sell more action figures to them.   The Action sequences unfold in a comic book fashion with typically big hits, but in clever development our hero doesn't trundle though the villains like a freight train.  Sure he kicks ass but we are made to see that he is only human and he bleeds like the rest of the characters. This is what makes Batman quite special, he is only a man.  The film feels a bit constricted because it is shot mostly on specially constructed stages so you end up seeing the same locations again and again, from different angles but you are usually having too much fun to notice or care.  Batman is all good basically, and is definitely worth a look on video or adding it to that increasing video library.

The cinematography in this movie is striking. It is a tribute to and a step beyond the greatest B&W film noir of the past. It ranks up there with BladeRunner and SE7EN as modern standards of light and shadow as character.  New Orleans has never looked more elegantly seedy.  This marvellous photography is used by Alan Parker to create a very ominous and nasty atmosphere, which is perfect for this clever detective tale gone gothic horror.  The tone of this film is palpabele.  Mickey Rourke is excellent here, easily the most complete and interesting performance of his career, and DeNiro looks like he's having fun as Mr. Cyphre.  Unlike recent films such as Fallen and especially The Devil's Advocate there are no cop-out endings that ring unfair or false, just the inevitable conclusion to the story of a doomed soul.

That's not the only moment in this film worthy of that accolade.  UHF, starring and largely conceived by musical parodist Weird Al Yankovic, is the story of an American dream-owning our own low-powered TV station, and putting whatever the hell we want on it. Weird Al is an effective protagonist as George Newman, an unsuccessful, single male who along with his friend Bob, gets fired from darn near everywhere.  George is also having romantic problems with Teri (Victoria Jackson, direct from SNL), who wants him to get a real job.  George's uncle Harvey wins the deed to U-62 in a poker game, and instead of giving it up, his wife convinces him to let George run it.  Wackiness ensues.  The TV show parodies in this film are mostly hilarious, with sight gags courtesy of a midget cameraman and a big, coffee-guzzling tech guy.  But perhaps the greatest performance in this movie is by Michael Richards (yes, Kramer), as very inept janitor\/kid's show host Stanley Spadowski.  Bumbling, mumbling, yet warm hearted, he's also really darn funny.  I swear you'll never think of oatmeal the same way again.  Yeah, the plot sucks, but if you're renting a film with Weird Al on the cover and expecting Pride and Prejudice, you have some major problems.  UHF is one of my favorite movies of all time, and it will be one of yours, too.
