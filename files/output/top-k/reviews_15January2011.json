[{"date":"15 January 2011","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I want to live like animals, careless and free.If a song ever embodied a movie, Savage Garden's The Animal Song serves to define the actions and emotions of the main characters in the movie, Carla and Daniel, two mentally challenged young adults who, finding each other, learn to live life to the fullest while leading each other through it. The strength and sweetness of The Other Sister can be found in the bravery and certainty that Carla, its main character, approaches life, navigating her way through the film in the manner of someone who knows what she wants out of life and seeks it with a childlike abandon.Juliette Lewis does a good job as Carla, the mildly mentally retarded daughter of the Tate's, a rich family that has had the struggle of Carla's handicap and having to send her away to a private, special education school. Mrs. Tate, (Diane Keaton), invokes responses on both ends of the spectrum from us, wanting to make up the lost years to Carla, I'm going to make it up to that girl, Radley, I promise, she says, and an inability to let Carla grow up and be on her own out of fear, and, perhaps, stubbornness.Tom Skerrit, as Mr. Tate, does a remarkably good job as a husband living with the past of a drinking problem and inability to be there for Carla as a child- but a man who is certainly there for her now. He champions first her desire to attend a Polytechnic School to get a certificate to be a Veterinarian's Assistant and then to move into her own apartment for the first time in her life. He holds the family together while seemingly apologetic for mistakes he has made in the past. Supporting actors add important depth to this touching film. Two sisters line the cast Heather (Sarah Paulson) and Caroline (Poppy Montgomery), do a good job at adding another layer to the family drama. Caroline is getting married to a fiancée, while Heather, who works in New York, is also seeking affirmation from her mother to acknowledge the fact that she is gay. The sisters also act as a moral battleground, stating that Carla be treated as a normal person, and allowed to make to take the same mistakes or risks as ordinary people. The crux of the story, and some of the most touching scenes in the film involve the budding romance between Carla and Daniel McMahon, a likewise mentally challenged boy she meets at her school. Part of the charm of their involvement is the childlike innocence with which they treat one another- while, to the rest of the world around them their behavior is awkward or untimely, to each other it is markedly candid, and innocent in a way most adults are not able to achieve. Carla becomes a best friend for Daniel, who, unlike her, does not have the support of a loving family. His distant father pays his rent, but is otherwise uninvolved, and all but cuts him off when he fails his class at the polytechnic for the umpteenth time. The only person in his life is Ernie, a handyman at his apartment, who acts as a father and friend but can't give him what Carla does- someone who understands. While not as well adjusted as Carla, instead of using this as a plot arc, the film uses it to show the sweetness in Carla and their relationship. She is there for him when he needs her. This is best illustrated in two scenes, the first of which is a dance at the Polytechnic school where Carla finds out she has passed her subject, while Daniel has not. Upset, Daniel breaks down, and then embarrassed, runs from Carla. Against his pleas, Carla, never judgmental, or superior, consoles him by telling him that she learned to take easy subjects first, before you take hard ones in an attempt to cheer him up.A second scene is a fight with Carla and her mother, Carla's mother adamant that Daniel is not right for her because He is the first boy you've met and I think you can do better. Carla's heartfelt explanation as to why this is wrong, I can't do better because I'm not better, is better understood to explain that she and Daniel are the same, and that she has accepted who she is and that, as she states, I can't be a painter or a tennis player&#x85;but I can love. Her point when Carla's mother exclaims that Danny can barely take care of himself, let alone her is poignant. We can take care of each other, Carla claims in sweetness and loyalty to Daniel, and in a way ignorant that men should take care of women, and in a way that speaks of her and Daniel's friendship, love, and desire to be there for each other in a pure, simplistic way that many of us will never realize. Critics of The Other Sister cite its oversimplification as a downside, as well as its attempt to make mental retardation seem cute. But something else exists within this movie that is special- it is the careless innocence and bravery in which Carla treats the world, as though there is nothing in life that is too complicated as long as you follow your heart. The love between Carla and Danny is not clumsy but real- and follows an outline of two real, caring people that have found each other rather then recycled stereotypes of how couples within a relationship should act, so often promoted in media and modern life.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"15 January 2011","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This film, perhaps Spielberg's best among his more entertaining fair, is essentially about the war between wonder and fear. As human beings, we have an innate sensibility of fearing the unknown as a defense mechanism to combat those things which could be hostile and threaten our existence, be they at the individual level or at the societal level. History is filled with examples, usually of a tragic nature, in which human beings perpetrate against each other the worst kinds of inhumanity in the name of fear, be it religious, economic, or political. In large conflicts, human beings on each side rationalize that their adversaries are heinous monsters intentionally engaging in wrong-doing as an act of evil. Both sides, in other words, believe they are on the side right and vilify the other. In this circumstance, all behavior is dictated by fear rather than wonder.Countered to this inbred fear is also the capacity to engage in wonder. Human beings are also infinitely curious, and our curiosity stems from a child-like desire of wanting to know, to understand, and even to touch that which may be different. Fear and wonder are very incompatible bedfellows which reside in each of us. It is a constant challenge for the human race to decide which emotion will have its say in terms of behavior wonder or fear. Fear is about anger, stereotypes, barriers, burning bridges, and making war. Wonder is about happiness, trust, letting go, being curious, and being vulnerable; it may be ultimately linked to those emotions associated with love. In the brilliant SF film Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Spielberg and co. explore how these two opposing views clash in the midst of our third encounter with aliens from outer space.Early on, the story draws the divisions between those characters driven by fear as opposed to those who are willing to throw off fear in favor of wonder. Claude Lacombe (Francois Truffaut) and David Laughlin (Bob Balaban) are the two investigators who are led around the world by the series of inter-connected coincidences which lead them to believe something extra-terrestrial is going on. They are in the wonder department. And so is Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), a mid-west suburbanite who has an amazing encounter, as well as a little boy, Barry, in the same geographical region who is enthralled with the coming of the aliens.The US military, Roy's wife Ronnie Nearie (Teri Garr) and their family, and at first Jillian (Melinda Dillon), the mother of the little boy, belong in the fear department. In a simultaneously poignant and revealing scene, when the aliens come to visit the little boy's house one night, his mother shuts all the doors. Then suddenly, Barry opens one of the doors revealing a splendor of light and magic spilling from beyond. Jillian runs to the door and quickly closes it. She will not forsake her child's safety for Barry's wonder and curiosity. Over and over, Barry displays a kind of innocent curiosity for the encounter while his mother can only react in fear. Lacking the fear of his mother, Barry eventually leaves the safety of his mother and joins the aliens.Ronnie Neary not only can't understand Roy's mood-swing from his encounter, she doesn't want to know anything about it. Something has been planted in Roy's mind, presumably by the aliens during his encounter, and he can't reconcile the image and its meaning. But Ronnie only fears what she doesn't understand. Roy doesn't do himself any favors when he turns his family upside down, but neither does his family attempt to find out what's troubling him. Fear becomes her dominating emotion while Roy is desperate to understand. The US military acts similarly to Ronnie as they want no outside interference in regards to the alien encounters, and continually deny the presence of these encounters.Ultimately, by film's end, we learn that all the fears of the characters have been unfounded, a delusion on their part. All consternation and trouble, which are usually required for a story to be compelling, were human-created and not of alien origin. The encounters were designed out of benevolence, not hostility. Only one character, that of Barry's mother, realizes her error and changes from one who is at first fearful to someone who is willing to embrace wonder.I believe fear rarely serves the human race. Certainly, fear has its place if a rhino is charging at you in the jungle. But if all human behavior is dictated by fear rather than a child-like wonder, we will miss out on some of the best of human experience, which I think may be Spielberg's point. The encounters and the close encounter of the third kind are only possible when human beings tear down the walls, throw down the barriers, and build bridges to the unknown. Certainly the unknown may be filled with snakes. But it could be filled with treasure also. The child risks falling by walking on two legs. Maybe adults should learn to do the same. Are we going to be a species who continually hides under the bed in the face of the unknown, or are we going to be the little boy who opens the door into the world of unknown wonders?

Perhaps it would help to read the book, but unfortunately the necessary time is lacking. My problem is not in the cinematic part of the film. The actors do a great job, while carving their characters without using excessive dramatization. The dialogs and the story are easily accessible. And the costumes and the set give an accurate portrayal of city life in the Netherlands at the start of the twentieth century. So basically the film outperforms many Hollywood and Bollywood products, and is worth seeing. My perturbation stems from the unwillingness in the narrative to weave some kind of message. It seems as though the narrative tries to please as large an audience as possible. As a result we have a film that is nihilistic it could equally be claimed as an advocacy of liberalism, fascism or religion. Of glorifying the family or a promiscuous life. Since I fail to grasp the essence of the film, I will simply recount the events. The main character is the usher Dreverhaven. He is a man of extreme dedication and formalism, which is interpreted by some people as lacking sense. One day his housekeeper Katadreuffe lures him in her bed, without any exchange of words. It is a one-night stand, and afterwards life continues as usual. However, she becomes pregnant, and resigns. From then on the usher sends an envelope with money enclosed, and a note When will we get married? After a year she writes back Will always be returned. She contends that she doesn't need anything from him. Her son is born, and he educates himself by using an English encyclopedia. Eventually he becomes employed at the office of a lawyer. His employer becomes a benefactor for him, which allows him to finish a study in law. Of course this is highly unusual at the time, because of the contemporary class society. In the mean time we see the usher Dreverhaven, expelling laborers from their houses. He even becomes the target of Bolshevist agitation, and is nearly shot dead. There are whispers, that he has become an alcoholic. Decades later, he personally visits Katadreuffe, and again asks When will we get married? She replies I will never marry you. But there has never been another. Which actually is not true, because another man had proposed to her, and she had pondered over his offer. Dreverhaven contends that he will squeeze ninety percent of life out of their son, and the remaining ten percent will make him into a man. Perhaps this explains his zeal for his profession? Soon Katadreuffe dies because of a fragile health, and Dreverhaven is present at her burial. Several months later, her son obtains his degree in law, and visits Dreverhaven. The son reproaches Dreverhaven his opposition, and vows to expel him out of his life. Which is rather strange, since Dreverhaven has supplied several loans in order to support his sons studies. Anyway, the son attacks his father, they fight, and Dreverhaven loses. The following day he is found dead, fallen from the top floor of his warehouse, with a knife in his stomach. It is assumed that he has killed himself, and in his will he has left his impressive wealth to his son. The will is signed with Father. Basically this film contains no evil people - except perhaps the Bolshevist's, who ignore law and order. The birth of the son seems a sheer coincidence. Is the film a criticism of the capitalist terror against the people? Of the getting loose of your parents? Of the need to get forward in life? Note my guide on literature suggests that Bordewijk likes to portray characters that take their features to an absurd level, becoming inhuman caricatures. His stories integrate clarity into a nightmare.

From then on the usher sends an envelope with money enclosed, and a note When will we get married? After a year she writes back Will always be returned. She contends that she doesn't need anything from him. Her son is born, and he educates himself by using an English encyclopedia. Eventually he becomes employed at the office of a lawyer. His employer becomes a benefactor for him, which allows him to finish a study in law. Of course this is highly unusual at the time, because of the contemporary class society. In the mean time we see the usher Dreverhaven, expelling laborers from their houses. He even becomes the target of Bolshevist agitation, and is nearly shot dead. There are whispers, that he has become an alcoholic. Decades later, he personally visits Katadreuffe, and again asks When will we get married? She replies I will never marry you. But there has never been another. Which actually is not true, because another man had proposed to her, and she had pondered over his offer. Dreverhaven contends that he will squeeze ninety percent of life out of their son, and the remaining ten percent will make him into a man. Perhaps this explains his zeal for his profession? Soon Katadreuffe dies because of a fragile health, and Dreverhaven is present at her burial. Several months later, her son obtains his degree in law, and visits Dreverhaven. The son reproaches Dreverhaven his opposition, and vows to expel him out of his life. Which is rather strange, since Dreverhaven has supplied several loans in order to support his sons studies. Anyway, the son attacks his father, they fight, and Dreverhaven loses. The following day he is found dead, fallen from the top floor of his warehouse, with a knife in his stomach. It is assumed that he has killed himself, and in his will he has left his impressive wealth to his son. The will is signed with Father. Basically this film contains no evil people - except perhaps the Bolshevist's, who ignore law and order. The birth of the son seems a sheer coincidence. Is the film a criticism of the capitalist terror against the people? Of the getting loose of your parents? Of the need to get forward in life?

Perhaps it would help to read the book, but unfortunately the necessary time is lacking. My problem is not in the cinematic part of the film. The actors do a great job, while carving their characters without using excessive dramatization. The dialogs and the story are easily accessible. And the costumes and the set give an accurate portrayal of city life in the Netherlands at the start of the twentieth century. So basically the film outperforms many Hollywood and Bollywood products, and is worth seeing. My perturbation stems from the unwillingness in the narrative to weave some kind of message. It seems as though the narrative tries to please as large an audience as possible. As a result we have a film that is nihilistic it could equally be claimed as an advocacy of liberalism, fascism or religion. Of glorifying the family or a promiscuous life. Since I fail to grasp the essence of the film, I will simply recount the events. The main character is the usher Dreverhaven. He is a man of extreme dedication and formalism, which is interpreted by some people as lacking sense. One day his housekeeper Katadreuffe lures him in her bed, without any exchange of words.

Singh is one of the most visually innovative directors working today but in eleven years this will be his third movie. His refusal to compromise his vision has made him an abnormality in Hollywood. His last movie, The Fall, came out in 2006 and was self-financed; it was the most beautiful movie of that year and no one saw it; it barely had distribution and didn't make a huge profit. But it has created a following. When I saw this movie I thought two things 1) I couldn't wait to watch his next movie; and 2) he couldn't possible surpass himself.Well, regarding the second one it turns out he already did, with his 2000 debut The Cell, a movie that is hard to categorise because it mixes horror, science fiction, mystery, fantasy and drama in one single coherent and fascinating story. But for simplicity's sake let's call it a horror movie.Serial killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) becomes comatose shortly after kidnapping a new victim. The police know, from Stargher's modus operandi, that if she isn't found soon she will drown inside an unbreakable glass cell that fills with water (Stargher kindly films the slow death and sends tapes to the cops). So it's up to FBI Agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn in a fine performance before his conversion into a mediocre comedy actor) to ask Dr. Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) for help. You see, Catherine has helped develop a method that allows people to enter the minds of comatose patients to see if she can wake them up. Of course no one wants Stargher to wake up &#x96; they just want clues that can lead them to the final victim.The only problem is that Stargher's psyche has fragmented into three personalities his abused childhood self, the adult Carl, and a demonic god-like creature that rules supreme over his fantasy mental landscape.I think this premise is good in itself and screenwriter Mark Protosevich deserves congratulations for it. It has a sense of urgency a life is at stake, the clock is ticking, and the tension keeps us on the edge of our seats anxious to see how they're going to beat Stargher's omnipotent god personality and find out what they came looking for.But the visuals are the main attraction. When the movie takes place in the real world, it's nothing special to look at. But when it gets inside a mind (Stargher's isn't the only one that's visited) it's a parade of classic art-inspired sets, beautiful landscapes, otherworldly costumes (courtesy of Eiko Ishioka, the costume designer of Francis Ford Coppola's unforgettable Dracula), and architecture that mixes the ordinary with the fantastic. Norwegian painter Odd Nerdrum, British artist Damien Hirst, and H.R. Giger (of Alien fame) are just some of the artists referenced by Singh in this vast display of artistic erudition. If you're an art fan, you'll have as much fun enjoying the story as you'll have spotting the references, although it's not necessary to know them to appreciate the movie. It's just an extra for people who like to dissect movies.Although the movie is gorgeous to look at, even when it's horrifying (and when it gets inside Stargher's mind the movie may reach uncomfortable levels of misogynistic and bondage imagery for some viewers), Singh also has a good grip on narrative. The first minutes show him deftly developing three different narratives &#x96; Catherine, Novak, and Stargher &#x96; and slowly making them run into each other until they become integrated.The movie, unexpectedly, also has strong humanist themes running through it. Catherine is a psychiatrist trying to cure comatose patients. We first see her inside a boy's mind trying to help him wake up. Catherine is all love and altruism. When she enters Stargher's mind she feels sorry for him even though he's a serial killer. Although most viewers would like to see Stargher meet a horrible end, Catherine tries to save him from his tormenting demonic ruler so he can have some peace at last. Catherine believes in forgiveness and it's no wonder Christian symbolism is another big part of the movie's imagery.The movie also takes time to show how Stargher developed his hatred for women and doesn't spare us the abuses he endured during childhood at the hands of his brutal father. Modern movies love absolute, mysterious evil &#x96; Anton Chigurh, The Joker, etc. &#x96; because it's cooler (and simpler to portray?) but the people who study and capture serial killers (people who know real evil, not Hollywood mass-consumption evil) will be the first to say that human monsters are made. So The Cell was quite refreshing and intellectual in this regard too.D'Onofrio steals the show whereas Lopez demonstrates once again that with a good screenplay she can give efficient performances (I've always liked her tough cop roles in The Money Train and Out of Sight), and Vaughn was quite a surprise in an intense dramatic role. Add to their performances a suspenseful story, then make art direction, make-up, costume design and cinematography integral characters of the story, and you have a mesmerising horror thriller that disturbs as much as it moves.Tarsem Singh's debut announced a brave new voice in Hollywood, a voice that audiences have barely heard yet but that carries greatness.

Nowadays, watching this movie again I can't take it seriously when there is always something that takes me out of the movie. Whether it is the terrible writing, the stupid characters, the boring plot, etc. there are almost no scenes where I have questions or find something wrong with it. The thing I do like about this movie and the other films as well is that the cinematography is excellent. The lighting, sets, and the special effects are all excellent. But that does little to save the film.Most of my complaints would be forgivable if the story was good right? Yet this is one of the laziest and the most poorly written stories in film (and literature) history. This story has the most holes I have ever seen. For starters how come the Dursley's don't want Harry to go to Hogwarts? Its pretty clear that they don't like him one bit, proved by the way they constantly shove him aside and have him sleep in under the F*****G STAIRS! IS THERE NO SUCH THING AS CHILD SERVICES IN Britain?! I mean for gods sake! He sleeps in a f*****g cupboard, they make him cook for them, he should sue their** for neglect or at the very least, child cruelty. Anyway, back to why the Dursley's keep Harry away from Hogwarts, wouldn't letting him go solve their problems? They don't like him, they don't want him, so why not let him go?! It would get him off their hands for a majority of the year. Harry would be happy, the Dursley's will be happy, everyone wins.At this point I'm only 15 minutes into the movie and already I've lost hope for it being any good. Any semblance of favorable nostalgia I have for this film is long gone. Onto the Quidditch match, are there no such things as rules?! The teacher who started the game off said that she wanted a clean game. Literally one minute later, two Gryffindore players have been injured at the hands of the Slytherin players. I mean seriously, one of the hits the goalie with a ball, two Slytherin players force one Gryffindore player into one of the f*****g towers, falling down it onto the field from what could be dozens of feet in the air while flying at relatively fast speeds. Is there no such thing as a disqualification?! Players must have a clean game but are free to hit and severely injure players as much as they wish. I guess if they don't kill them than its okay (sarcasm). The whole Quidditch scene baffled me. It made no sense and was incredibly stupid as a whole.I feel this would be a good time to talk about the characters. First I want to rant about Hermione. It's established that her parents are muggles. If that's true, then how the f*** did she get into Hogwarts? If her parents are not aware of the school than how did she get in? If her parents are aware, than that must mean other parents are aware as well, if so, then how come Hogwarts isn't getting flooded with people trying to get in? It would make the selection process much more prestigious and to be accepted would mean great things about your family. Yet this possibility is immediately negated when Harry is trying to get to Platform 9 3\/4 when the worker there knows nothing about the platform. (*Note I am about to rant on this scene). When Harry meets Ron and they go to the platform, how does no one see them at all? One guy walks right past one of the Weasley kids goes running into the wall and vanishes into thin air. HOW DO YOU NOT NOTICE THAT?! HOW COULD YOU NOT NOTICE PEOPLE RUNNING INTO WALLS AND DISAPPEARING AND NOT F*****G NOTICE?! THERE'S SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF AND THEN THERE'S INSULTING MY F*****G INTELLIGENCE! Then there is our main villain, Voldemort.

When Harry goes into that room with Professor Quirrell in it, Harry finally sees Voldemort for the first time, and we see Voldemort on the back of Quirrell's head. Not only is this effect laughable, it's downright stupid. Voldemort looks just as silly as he does in the newer movies, and not the least bit intimidating. Anyway, when Harry refuses Voldemort's promise of power, he sends Quirrell to attack. Yet, when Harry touches him, his hand melts in a way similar to that of acid. At first I thought it was because Harry was an alien from Ridley Scott's classic film, Alien, but no, that would have been cool. Instead, it is all because of love. Love from Harry's mother who died to save him...WHAT?! IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF F*****G LOVE? THAT IS SO STUPID IT BLOWS MY MIND! F*** THIS MOVIE!

Whether it is the terrible writing, the stupid characters, the boring plot, etc. there are almost no scenes where I have questions or find something wrong with it. The thing I do like about this movie and the other films as well is that the cinematography is excellent. The lighting, sets, and the special effects are all excellent. But that does little to save the film.Most of my complaints would be forgivable if the story was good right? Yet this is one of the laziest and the most poorly written stories in film (and literature) history. This story has the most holes I have ever seen. For starters how come the Dursley's don't want Harry to go to Hogwarts? Its pretty clear that they don't like him one bit, proved by the way they constantly shove him aside and have him sleep in under the F*****G STAIRS! IS THERE NO SUCH THING AS CHILD SERVICES IN Britain?! I mean for gods sake! He sleeps in a f*****g cupboard, they make him cook for them, he should sue their** for neglect or at the very least, child cruelty. Anyway, back to why the Dursley's keep Harry away from Hogwarts, wouldn't letting him go solve their problems? They don't like him, they don't want him, so why not let him go?! It would get him off their hands for a majority of the year. Harry would be happy, the Dursley's will be happy, everyone wins.At this point I'm only 15 minutes into the movie and already I've lost hope for it being any good. Any semblance of favorable nostalgia I have for this film is long gone. Onto the Quidditch match, are there no such things as rules?! The teacher who started the game off said that she wanted a clean game. Literally one minute later, two Gryffindore players have been injured at the hands of the Slytherin players. I mean seriously, one of the hits the goalie with a ball, two Slytherin players force one Gryffindore player into one of the f*****g towers, falling down it onto the field from what could be dozens of feet in the air while flying at relatively fast speeds. Is there no such thing as a disqualification?! Players must have a clean game but are free to hit and severely injure players as much as they wish. I guess if they don't kill them than its okay (sarcasm). The whole Quidditch scene baffled me. It made no sense and was incredibly stupid as a whole.I feel this would be a good time to talk about the characters. First I want to rant about Hermione. It's established that her parents are muggles. If that's true, then how the f*** did she get into Hogwarts? If her parents are not aware of the school than how did she get in? If her parents are aware, than that must mean other parents are aware as well, if so, then how come Hogwarts isn't getting flooded with people trying to get in? It would make the selection process much more prestigious and to be accepted would mean great things about your family. Yet this possibility is immediately negated when Harry is trying to get to Platform 9 3\/4 when the worker there knows nothing about the platform. (*Note I am about to rant on this scene). When Harry meets Ron and they go to the platform, how does no one see them at all? One guy walks right past one of the Weasley kids goes running into the wall and vanishes into thin air. HOW DO YOU NOT NOTICE THAT?! HOW COULD YOU NOT NOTICE PEOPLE RUNNING INTO WALLS AND DISAPPEARING AND NOT F*****G NOTICE?! THERE'S SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF AND THEN THERE'S INSULTING MY F*****G INTELLIGENCE! Then there is our main villain, Voldemort. Aside from having the stupidest name for a villain in history, his motivation is that he is just a power hungry a*****e, nothing more.There is so much wrong with this movie, I could go on for another ten minutes, but if you're still reading this then I will finish this up.The ending of this movie makes no sense whatsoever. When Harry goes into that room with Professor Quirrell in it, Harry finally sees Voldemort for the first time, and we see Voldemort on the back of Quirrell's head. Not only is this effect laughable, it's downright stupid. Voldemort looks just as silly as he does in the newer movies, and not the least bit intimidating. Anyway, when Harry refuses Voldemort's promise of power, he sends Quirrell to attack. Yet, when Harry touches him, his hand melts in a way similar to that of acid. At first I thought it was because Harry was an alien from Ridley Scott's classic film, Alien, but no, that would have been cool. Instead, it is all because of love. Love from Harry's mother who died to save him...WHAT?! IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF F*****G LOVE? THAT IS SO STUPID IT BLOWS MY MIND! F*** THIS MOVIE! It's a stupid, idiotic mess of a movie with terrible writing and stupid characters. I hated nearly every scene in this movie. If it weren't for Alan Rickman and the good cinematography, I would award this with a much lower score, but as it stands, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a 4\/10.

That would have been more logical than to send some grunts to look for the proverbial needle in haystack. Anyway, this is the most interesting Spielberg film I've seen, if only because it shows his shortcomings as filmmaker. Let's be clear there are really two movies here, rather three, which show his inability to cope with 160 minutes of good, consistent, cinema in just one swoop of a movie. The first film is, of course, the reenactment on the Omaha landing, the best part of the whole and the only one worth seeing. Excellent cinematography, especially the hand--held--camera trick, which is mostly appropriate here but which later became annoying as Spielberg seems to have fallen in love with it, to the point of using it in even the most trivial sequences. Anyway, good film overall (But what's the point, when I can watch authentic footage from Iwo Jima, Tarawa and so on?) The second movie is interesting, because you can compare it to another film with an almost identical plot AN. In both we have a military team who goes looking for a man in a war ravaged land, with Hanks playing here the role Martin Sheen played there. And with the difference that in this case they go to save Ryan while in AN they go to kill Kurtz. Put both films together and you'll see why AN is a masterpiece while SPR is just a wannabe. The first thing Coppola did when confronted to his plot was to set a strong link between Willard & Kurtz. In AN, Willard is regularly informed about Kurtz; Kurtz is ever present, he's like a cloud hovering above the boat. In SPR instead Ryan is just an abstraction, he's mostly irrelevant in the plot, he doesn't exist. That is why this (second) film threatens to fall apart from the beginning--as Spielberg failed in establishing such a link--and why he had to recur to diverse, rather random, elements to keep the story afloat. This explains the episodic nature the movie takes, with the addition of elements disconnected from each other, which served no useful role in the plot; for ex., that absurd tug of war around the French girl. Or the foul up about the wrong Ryan&#x97;which I'm told now it's funny. The attack on the radar station is also gratuitous, as it doesn't give us any additional info on the context. This brings me to the subject of the context itself.I see that the most vocal critics of SPR here are the Brits, which feel cheated of their role in that war. I would ask them what war? I don't see any war here, just a landing and then some random shooting. You wouldn't even know there's a war going on, as NO context is given. There you got another difference with AN. But Hanks and his men are no much different than Willard and his crew in that boat, they constitute a universe apart from the war, independent from it, but inserted in it anyway. But there we see Coppola's genius too; he doesn't lose the least occasion to keep tensions high in the group, by giving a sharp edge to each member especially to Willard and making them constantly collide. In SPR instead, added to the almost total absence of such edges, Willard's equivalent is played by the last actor I would have chosen for the part. Hanks can only play all around nice, honest guys. He's so nice that, even when he caused the stupid death of one of his subordinates, he didn't cause any turmoil in his platoon. So nice I didn't even feel sad for his death, knowing he was going straight to Heaven.If the second film is at best uneven, with strong sequences--Wade's death--alternating with bad ones--tug of war for the girl--the third film is a waste of time. That 45-minute battle served no purpose, as nothing new is added to the mix. In most war movies men go into action with still unsettled issues between them--as Mallory & Miller in GON--or with themselves--the coward who has to prove himself for ex., but not here.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"15 January 2011","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Ethan Edwards, a Confederate veteran of the American Civil War, returns to the home of his brother Aaron in a remote part of northern Texas. Shortly afterwards the homestead is raided by Comanche Indians and Aaron, his wife and his son are killed. His two daughters Lucy and Debbie are abducted, but Lucy is murdered shortly afterwards. The rest of the film deals with Ethan's obsessive search, together with his adoptive nephew Martin, for Debbie, his last surviving blood relative.A common theme in Westerns was the fraught relationship between Native Americans and white settlers. Many of the earlier examples had presented this relationship in a biased, one-sided and sometimes frankly racist manner (Whites good, Indians bad), and indeed John Ford himself had sometimes been guilty of such stereotyping, as in Rio Grande, the last instalment in his cavalry trilogy. By the mid-1950s, however, things were starting to change. Broken Arrow from 1950 had been a seminal Western which gave equal prominence to white and Indian characters and showed that there were men of goodwill, as well as men of violence, on both sides of the racial divide. Robert Aldrich's Apache from four years later went even further, by replacing the old racial certainties with new ones in which the Indians are the innocent victims and whites the villains.In The Searchers Ford takes a deeper look at racial issues. It is unsparing in its analysis of the nature of white racism, but it does not idealise the Native Americans in the way in which they were idealised in Apache, or the good Indians were idealised in Broken Arrow. Ethan has a deep loathing for all Native Americans, especially the Comanche, which is only partially explained by the massacre of his family. Yet he also has no love for the US Government; having given his allegiance to the Confederacy he refuses to acknowledge the legitimacy of US rule over Texas. Living in an arid area of west Texas, many hundreds of miles from the nearest plantation, it is unlikely that he ever had any real interest in the slavery question, but his loyalty to the Confederate cause doubtless arose out of his deep-seated contempt for all non-white races.Ethan's original aim is to rescue Debbie from captivity, but over the years that aim changes. His search lasts several years and he eventually learns that Debbie, now a teenager, has been adopted into the tribe and has become the wife of a Comanche warrior named Scar. To Ethan any white woman who has sexual relations with an Indian man is irredeemably tainted, and the idea that his own niece is in this position is an insupportable stain on what he sees as his honour. He therefore decides to kill her in order to redeem his honour, Unlike Aldrich's, however, Ford's vision is not simply Indians good, Whites bad. Even Ethan can be shocked by the behaviour of his own people, as when he and Martin come across the Indian victims of a massacre perpetrated by American soldiers, and as we have seen the Indians are also capable of acts of brutality. Martin, who is horrified by the idea of killing Debbie, whom he regards as a sister, is more liberal than Ethan, although there are limits to his liberalism. His idea is that Debbie must be returned to what he sees as civilisation, even when she has made it clear that she would much rather remain with the Comanche. (The Unforgiven from five years later dealt with the opposite situation, in which an Indian girl would rather stay with the white family who have adopted her than return to her own people; both films were adapted from books by the same novelist, Alan Le May).Part of the myth which has grown up around John Wayne is the idea that he only ever played clean-cut, morally upright, all-American heroes. In fact, his range as an actor was rather wider than that, and the obsessively racist Ethan is in many ways deeply unsympathetic, although some of his qualities, such as his physical courage and his dogged determination, command our respect. This is one of the most complex roles Wayne played, and he gives one of his best performances, to rank alongside the likes of Stagecoach and The Shootist. He later named one of his sons Ethan after the character he plays here.When The Searchers came out in 1956, although it was a commercial success, it did not receive a single Academy Award nomination- an example of the Academy's notorious prejudice against the Western genre at this time. Today, however, it is frequently cited not only as one of the greatest Westerns of all time but also as one of the greatest movies of all time. Martin Scorsese is one of a number of directors who holds it in particularly high esteem.Personally, I would not rate it as my all-time favourite film, or even my favourite Western. As in other films, like Cheyenne Autumn, Ford allows his main serious theme to be slowed down by unnecessary subplots and misguided attempts at humour. I am thinking in particular of the romantic subplot about Martin's love for Laurie, the daughter of a neighbouring rancher, and the rather patronising treatment of the simpleton Old Mose and Martin's Indian wife Look. (He calls her that as he is unable to pronounce her real name).Nevertheless, The Searchers is still in many ways a fine movie, partly for Wayne's acting, partly for the striking photography of the Western landscapes and powerful way in which Ford treats his main theme when he does not allow himself to be sidetracked. He always had the ability to compose a memorable image, and this talent is well demonstrated in this film, the final shot of Wayne framed in a doorway being perhaps the most famous example. If this is not my all-time favourite Western, it would nevertheless come somewhere in my top twenty. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 January 2011","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Ethan Edwards, a Confederate veteran of the American Civil War, returns to the home of his brother Aaron in a remote part of northern Texas. Shortly afterwards the homestead is raided by Comanche Indians and Aaron, his wife and his son are killed. His two daughters Lucy and Debbie are abducted, but Lucy is murdered shortly afterwards. The rest of the film deals with Ethan's obsessive search, together with his adoptive nephew Martin, for Debbie, his last surviving blood relative.A common theme in Westerns was the fraught relationship between Native Americans and white settlers. Many of the earlier examples had presented this relationship in a biased, one-sided and sometimes frankly racist manner (Whites good, Indians bad), and indeed John Ford himself had sometimes been guilty of such stereotyping, as in Rio Grande, the last instalment in his cavalry trilogy. By the mid-1950s, however, things were starting to change. Broken Arrow from 1950 had been a seminal Western which gave equal prominence to white and Indian characters and showed that there were men of goodwill, as well as men of violence, on both sides of the racial divide. Robert Aldrich's Apache from four years later went even further, by replacing the old racial certainties with new ones in which the Indians are the innocent victims and whites the villains.In The Searchers Ford takes a deeper look at racial issues. It is unsparing in its analysis of the nature of white racism, but it does not idealise the Native Americans in the way in which they were idealised in Apache, or the good Indians were idealised in Broken Arrow. Ethan has a deep loathing for all Native Americans, especially the Comanche, which is only partially explained by the massacre of his family. Yet he also has no love for the US Government; having given his allegiance to the Confederacy he refuses to acknowledge the legitimacy of US rule over Texas. Living in an arid area of west Texas, many hundreds of miles from the nearest plantation, it is unlikely that he ever had any real interest in the slavery question, but his loyalty to the Confederate cause doubtless arose out of his deep-seated contempt for all non-white races.Ethan's original aim is to rescue Debbie from captivity, but over the years that aim changes. His search lasts several years and he eventually learns that Debbie, now a teenager, has been adopted into the tribe and has become the wife of a Comanche warrior named Scar. To Ethan any white woman who has sexual relations with an Indian man is irredeemably tainted, and the idea that his own niece is in this position is an insupportable stain on what he sees as his honour. He therefore decides to kill her in order to redeem his honour, Unlike Aldrich's, however, Ford's vision is not simply Indians good, Whites bad. Even Ethan can be shocked by the behaviour of his own people, as when he and Martin come across the Indian victims of a massacre perpetrated by American soldiers, and as we have seen the Indians are also capable of acts of brutality.

Tarantino's screenplay absolutely bristles with electric energy.True Romance is one of my favourite films and I'm now onto the Director's Cut, that director being Tony Scott. What makes True Romance work for me is the central casting of Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, neither obvious candidates for such; he a geeky, ever cheerful comic-book store clerk and she a kooky, but endearingly naive hooker who he 'accidentally' meets in a back-street cinema. Clarence (Slater) has quietly divine interventions with Elvis (Val Kilmer), who guides him in mirrors of washrooms, and falls head over heels with the deliciously anatomically pleasing Alabama (Arquette). They kick around, watching kungfu videos, not particularly giving much of a damn about anything. When Clarence hears of her past - and her vicious pimp (an intensely psychotic Gary Oldman, in dreadlocks) and visits him, he ends up with far more than he ever bargained for.A welcome, natural tone comes when the couple meet up with Dennis Hopper as Clarence's security guard (& ex police) father, keeping the film's feet on the ground. The setting - a solemnly industrial Detroit winter-land, contrasts with lusciously sunny madcap road trip to L.A, a suitcase of cocaine to sell to a producer 'friend' of an actor 'friend' of Clarence's, this actor thinking he has a major part in a film. Hopper gets a not particularly welcome visit from the requisite Christopher Walken, as the 'owner' of the white stuff. That is pure Tarantino and a highlight for many lovers of the film.After the two leads, my favourite is Brad Pitt as the permanently stoned slacker, friend of the actor friend of Clarence's who habitually watches TV all day and casually invites mobsters in to join him in his leisure pursuits and then tells them all they want to know, totally not thinking of the consequences for his buddies. A slimline Soprano, James Gandolfini who lays in wait for Atlanta gets the fight of his life and this truly becomes suspenseful and blood-splattering violent. Meanwhile Clarence, still on 7th heaven about his marriage is getting the biggest cheeseburger ever for them both as a celebration.Black humour in abundance mocks Hollywood and its system, whilst cop Christopher Penn wires up another actor in the most awkward of places, who's been caught foul of the law when his dope literally ends up all over his face. It does get a little mad and bad and this is about the only part I think that lessens the film. A traditional shoot-it-up, bullet spraying ending leaves our couple running for their lives once again. Do they live happily ever after? This is Tarantino, not Disney, so you'll have to find out for yourself.A sublimely cool Chris Isaak song unrolls with the end credits.

I've dug through pretty much the whole pile and the only one that I haven't watch yet is the sequel to this. Could this be the one film that surpasses LtD in humor, quality, and amusement. Judging from the IMDb rating of 3.2, and the people I talk to telling me it's awful, I doubt it.Starring Jason Robards, Corey Feldman, Piper Laurie, Meredith Salenger, Harry Dean Stanton, and Corey Haim.

It makes increasingly less sense as the second half of the film develops. While it is not hard to come up with an interpretation of it, I doubt there is a truly satisfying one, and any film that has to revert to dreams before it can make any sense should be marked down in my opinion. I believe films are better when they offer a more coherent plot and entertain, rather than leave us guessing or at the very least have just one or two explanations which most intelligent people can be reasonably expected to figure out without tremendous effort. I wonder if some people rated this film highly because they were afraid to admit they did not understand it. Fear not, the film is empty and there is nothing to understand. Either that, or the director has decided to create something pointlessly complex that cannot be easily understood. I also prefer that mysteries should be decoded within the film itself for the most part, rather than leaving them for people to guess.As the film went on, it became clear first of all that this would not be the type of flick to tie up all the loose ends. My next realisation was that it would not even resolve the main plot line (not without resorting to it was a dream anyway). As it deteriorated into further mess and nonsense, seemingly more interested in random images and symbols than telling a story, I began to expect an ending that trailed off anticlimactically. Even though I fully expected a poor ending, I was still a little stunned by how pathetic and awful the ending was. I will be making a mental note of all Lynch films and will make a reasonable effort to avoid them because the film was so desperately pretentious and delivered so little that I am convinced that I will never enjoy any of his films.For this film to unravel to make sense, some of it must be a dream. That is not good enough to me.Also, why should I have to watch it 2-3 times before I fully understand it all. It's nowhere near good enough on any level to warrant that.

Offered as a paragon of the noir, Murder, My Sweet was my second of the genre, and first to introduce me to both the private eye and the femme fatale.Hired by the appropriately named Moose Malloy, private eye Philip Marlowe is tasked with finding his former lover Velma. When a client hiring Marlowe to act as a bodyguard is murdered whilst attempting to purchase back a stolen necklace, the detective finds himself thrust into a world of deception, confusion, and convolution.A narrative explored through the now-blinded protagonist's flashback, Murder, My Sweet benefits from one of the greatest narrations in cinematic memory. Adapted from the novel Farewell, My Lovely by hardboiled crime fiction legend Raymond Chandler, the film exploits the author's rich dialogue at every chance it gets. Marlowe is the king of the simile, each line coming from him awash with a cynicism-laced hilarity. The script is the kind that, upon a second viewing, will have your lips moving along with it, so unforgettable are the words within. Dick Powell, a musical star, delivers these iconic lines as though he was born to speak them, his straight-faced gaze as important to their effect as their original composition. The plot, in line with this seeker hero vein of noir, is distorted, intricate, and demanding. Full attention is a base requirement to understanding the turns in the film's story as Marlowe pursues the answers to questions which have often yet to be asked.

The archetypal noir relationships are all present here, and well articulated. Not afraid to play on concepts to a degree, the film has us wondering for a time the allegiances of the two central female characters, neither of their motives entirely understood until the film's climactic ending. One of the most cinematographically experimental and entertaining aspects of the film is the inevitable scene in which the protagonist is knocked unconscious by a sadistic thug, Marlowe's awakening from this accompanied by some of the narration's best moments and the camera's oddest tricks and techniques.

That being said, Andy Griffith displayed (in one of his first big roles) all the great talent that made him what he is. He could have been a great white bluesman, or a successful preacher. What a great talent Griffith is indeed.The beginning of the movie was very stark indeed - showing that the white South was no picnic. The prison was as miserable as one can imagine, and the future television demagogue (Griffith) was a drifter, who had no past that he could even talk about without lying. I also liked the opportunism of the Tony Franciosa character. He was an errand boy for the furniture store king, but grabbed unto the opportunity of being the promoter of the greatest radio\/TV personality ever created.I also like how advertising was shown as already heralding a new era. In 1957, the movie showed that the sixties were just around the corner. Griffith's character was Elvis, but you could already see that the Beatles were just around the corner. Women were paraded around to sell products. Pep pills were being peddled to the new, fast generation.What I didn't like was how the politically correct liberal came into fold in the face of Walter Matthau's character. In the end, a southern white could never truly be a liberator. So, when Griffith's character breaks ground by inviting a black woman on the stage, it had to be shown that he really was a fraud in the end. Left out is that LBJ and Huey Long, both southern whites, did more than the liberals ever did for black America.That is the part that I don't like much about this movie. It is a great movie with a great story. However, I don't like the fact that poor whites are just dismissed as opportunists and moral failures in the end. I wish that Kazan had developed the main character more. There was a lot of rage and confusion in the main character that needed further exploration. The movie needed to explain better how poverty bred mixed up, confused people like this TV demagogue. Instead, we are led to not feel much pity for him. I disagree.

He was an errand boy for the furniture store king, but grabbed unto the opportunity of being the promoter of the greatest radio\/TV personality ever created.I also like how advertising was shown as already heralding a new era. In 1957, the movie showed that the sixties were just around the corner. Griffith's character was Elvis, but you could already see that the Beatles were just around the corner. Women were paraded around to sell products. Pep pills were being peddled to the new, fast generation.What I didn't like was how the politically correct liberal came into fold in the face of Walter Matthau's character. In the end, a southern white could never truly be a liberator. So, when Griffith's character breaks ground by inviting a black woman on the stage, it had to be shown that he really was a fraud in the end. Left out is that LBJ and Huey Long, both southern whites, did more than the liberals ever did for black America.That is the part that I don't like much about this movie. It is a great movie with a great story. However, I don't like the fact that poor whites are just dismissed as opportunists and moral failures in the end. I wish that Kazan had developed the main character more. There was a lot of rage and confusion in the main character that needed further exploration. The movie needed to explain better how poverty bred mixed up, confused people like this TV demagogue. Instead, we are led to not feel much pity for him. I disagree.

That being said, Andy Griffith displayed (in one of his first big roles) all the great talent that made him what he is. He could have been a great white bluesman, or a successful preacher. What a great talent Griffith is indeed.The beginning of the movie was very stark indeed - showing that the white South was no picnic.

I really thought that the last scene when the 3 teens are in Paris when the sign on a store or hotel comes swooping down and hits the teen who questions who is next to die on death's list and who will be saved. That scared me and I am like there had better be a sequel to this film and it better be as good as this one!

The combination of this bearing the Coen stamp and being the first Cage film I'd seen since Adaptation&#x97;in which he is, dare I say it, bearable&#x97;assuaged my fears and allowed me to sit back with hope intact. The film's opening is rapid in pace, though not too much of a fault it's a little distracting, and feels a tad rushed, but it's no serious problem. The humour&#x97;for this is a comedy, in case you're unaware&#x97;starts relatively strong, an extended scene in which Hi attempts to control the quintuplets whilst choosing which to steal particularly humorous.
