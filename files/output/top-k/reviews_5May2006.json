I also saw on some late-night talk show Steve Martin explaining away about how he came up with his 'original' character in the movie. He even made physical gestures to justify his claim. Well...it just so happens that earlier, the very same day, I happened to be flipping through the cable channels and landed for a few minutes on Turner Classic Movies. I Was a Fugitive from a Chain Gang from about 1931 was showing. Guess what? It was right on a scene where Paul Muni's character's wife, a blonde, floozy, cheating, bimbo, received a phone call that he answered. It was one of her college-boy 'boyfriends' asking her to come out for a good time with them. He was the very same character that Steve Martin claimed he had totally and originally created himself!! He PLAGARIZED that character, right down to the thick glasses, haircut, speech pattern(lisp), and suit with a bow-tie!!!! Shame on you, Steve! I have exposed you.......

I saw the movie almost a week ago and every time I think about (which is a lot!) I just start laughing. 'Death to Smoochy' was a movie that always lingered on the periphery of my rental appetites; I'd heard so many bad things about it that you can't help but believe the hype. When it came out I couldn't find a single person who liked it or who wanted to like it and I think that maybe that's why I stayed away from it. A few years later I've had some distance and rediscovered it. All I can say is I'm so glad I did! 'Death to Smoochy' was part of Robin Williams self-described 'Triptych of Terror.' Along with 'Insomnia' and 'One Hour Photo,' he tried to set out and play characters very different from his past choices. People will argue about how they these performances were received initially, but I think they all have an edge and a complexity that easily outdistances a lot of his earlier work. His performance as Rainbow Randolph in 'Death to Smoochy' is the most comedic of his three dark turns. He is a man unhinged as his world is collapsing all around him, and realizing that he's fettered away or lost what little of anything he once had. His anguish turns to rage and his rage focuses in on his rival 'Smoochy.' Rival may not be the right word there since it insinuates two combatants. 'Smoochy' is so good-hearted and well-intentioned that he is largely oblivious to the machinations of the man whose time slot on network television he has stolen.'Death to Smoochy' is VICIOUSLY satirical. Very strong performances from Williams, Devito, and the always excellent Catherine Keener. Edward Norton is a bit of a revelation who knew the guy could be funny? Vincent Schiavelli plays a children's performer even farther down on his his luck and more desperate than Williams' Randolph. Littered with great character actors, this is a wonderfully dark and irreverent film that has three main themes 1. How far will a man go to get back what he's lost, 2. How strongly will one defend one's principles, and 3. Corruption through greed and how avarice can destroy those it ensnares.This is a wonderful film that deserves a second chance. My rating may go up for it in time. If you're looking for a satirically dark, edgy comedy that skewers network politics, uber-healthy lifestyles and children's programming (hey, throw in ice shows too!) than this is the film for you.

I can accept that the film won't be able to transport the viewer the way the words on the page can, but the sad part is that this movie never even comes close.In the book, Sam Callahan is heartwarming. He's a kid you want to get to know. You want to reassure him that it's okay to be this awkward when you're 13, and that everyone's adolescence (or most people's, anyway) are miserable. You laugh when he cracks a joke or lets you in on one of his precocious personal witticisms. You're moved when he talks about the Kennedy assassination from an intelligent but still hopelessly naive point of view. He eases the shock of sexual experimentation and of Maury's teenage pregnancy and takes you right into the reality of dealing with the consequences - of kids and adults thrown into circumstances that would make anyone grow up.But maybe it's too tall an order for film. Maybe the topics are too sensitive and the inner monologue is too hard to convey. Isn't it almost always the case that the movie adaptations of books fall on their faces to some extent?

I wanted some more...of the movie that was buried under the ruins of the second half of the screenplay.Supernova had a lot of potential. Spader and Bassett are very good actors, and Spader was amazingly buff for this role (as was practically every other male member of the cast). The special effects and deep space scenery ranged from being excellent to exciting and sometimes even spectacular (especially the shots from the ending credit sequence). While nothing in the art or production design had the Giger-inspired lunacy of Alien, Supernova was a very good looking movie. And the sound track was right on the money - moving, soaring, eerie, exciting, tender, everything it was supposed to be in a first class movie.It's too bad that the screenplay itself (which started out strongly) got bogged down in a mire of muddled philosophizing, maddening plot holes and inconsistencies and third rate editing.It seems as if the movie needed 15-20 extra minutes of plot development, exposition and dialog to fill in the ambitious goals it sets for itself. Instead it touches on a lot of interesting, potentially intriguing ideas - an alien artifact with Armageddeon-scale potential; a hospital ship on the deep frontier of space; an abandoned mine on a rogue moon; the price and implications of addiction to power and pleasure; the budding romance between Spader and Bassetts' characters; the specter of a super-powered serial killer stalking the ship; an AI coming to full 'wakefulness' as its computer guru plays chess with it. But everything is just set up with a few lines of dialog and never truly explored. Even the murders of the crew members has a very perfunctory 1-2-3 quality about it. The ending, when it comes, seems abrupt and unearned, as the ship's AI blithely reels off a string of exposition that begs for further development and exploration...but instead, the movie just ends.To make things worse, the plot holes are many and grievous. They drag the movie down into sci-fi gibberish. Earlier commentors covered them extremely well, but I'd like to show how some of the extra dialog and exposition I mentioned earlier might have gone a long way toward filling in these holes and lowering the irritation factor. For example Why doesn't the ship have pods for the patients? Because injured or sick patients wouldn't survive the jump even in a life support pod, so the ship stays at its destination and provides long term care until further help arrives. Why was the killer allowed to roam free around the ship? Because Spader still didn't trust his instincts around Karl and erred on the side of trust because of his own drug fueled background. Why didn't Sweetie - programmed never to take a life - try to prevent the murder of the first two crew members? Because the people who programmed her never dreamed of a maniac performing murderous violence on a hospital ship and her parameters weren't set to deal with that event. Why did Karl want to bring a fantastically dangerous device back into human space (if he understood its true nature, he would know it would kill him too, after all)? Because Hazen addiction turned him into a monster of narcissism vulnerable to the lure and metaprogramming of the device's alien makers. Why wasn't there a 'cut off' to allow Captain Marcy to stop the D-Jump until his pod could be repaired? Because the D-Jump, once begun, cannot be halted - the ship has to use the energies unleashed, or be destroyed in the ensuing chain reaction (which is why D-jumps are undertaken only with for missions of great urgency). Why weren't there shields on the ship to protect it from debris in the heavy gravity zone? There were, but the crap flying in space around them was far denser and more dangerous than than a hospital ship (as opposed to a military transport or war ship) was ever meant to encounter, so the shields weren't adequate to the task. See how easy that was? That took me less than five minutes.And yet the director(s) and the final screenwriter(s) couldn't be bothered to do this and the final patchwork product was released in an apparent hope that the pretty pictures and buff bodies on display would help the crippled story escape notice. Sorry, guys, the pretty baubles just made the editing and sloppiness of the second half look even worse.The DVD is a bare bones package, but it does have a nice extra 13 scenes deleted from the final cut, including an alternate ending that is much glummer and gloomier than the 'official' one. A few of these scenes are trivial and inessential (including the alternate opening )- but several of them would have added to the coherence and depth of the film quite nicely.Really, I ought to rate Supernova with a 4 or 5, but the glimpses of a much better, much more worthwhile movie kept popping through in the occasional line of dialog, or shot of deep space, or erotic scene, or bit of art direction. lighting and set design. So I feel like it deserves a 7 because it had so much potential - an possible 8 or 9 hobbled with a 3-4 type production difficulties. When will the studios ever learn?

But everything is just set up with a few lines of dialog and never truly explored. Even the murders of the crew members has a very perfunctory 1-2-3 quality about it. The ending, when it comes, seems abrupt and unearned, as the ship's AI blithely reels off a string of exposition that begs for further development and exploration...but instead, the movie just ends.To make things worse, the plot holes are many and grievous. They drag the movie down into sci-fi gibberish. Earlier commentors covered them extremely well, but I'd like to show how some of the extra dialog and exposition I mentioned earlier might have gone a long way toward filling in these holes and lowering the irritation factor. For example Why doesn't the ship have pods for the patients? Because injured or sick patients wouldn't survive the jump even in a life support pod, so the ship stays at its destination and provides long term care until further help arrives. Why was the killer allowed to roam free around the ship? Because Spader still didn't trust his instincts around Karl and erred on the side of trust because of his own drug fueled background. Why didn't Sweetie - programmed never to take a life - try to prevent the murder of the first two crew members? Because the people who programmed her never dreamed of a maniac performing murderous violence on a hospital ship and her parameters weren't set to deal with that event. Why did Karl want to bring a fantastically dangerous device back into human space (if he understood its true nature, he would know it would kill him too, after all)? Because Hazen addiction turned him into a monster of narcissism vulnerable to the lure and metaprogramming of the device's alien makers. Why wasn't there a 'cut off' to allow Captain Marcy to stop the D-Jump until his pod could be repaired? Because the D-Jump, once begun, cannot be halted - the ship has to use the energies unleashed, or be destroyed in the ensuing chain reaction (which is why D-jumps are undertaken only with for missions of great urgency). Why weren't there shields on the ship to protect it from debris in the heavy gravity zone? There were, but the crap flying in space around them was far denser and more dangerous than than a hospital ship (as opposed to a military transport or war ship) was ever meant to encounter, so the shields weren't adequate to the task. See how easy that was? That took me less than five minutes.And yet the director(s) and the final screenwriter(s) couldn't be bothered to do this and the final patchwork product was released in an apparent hope that the pretty pictures and buff bodies on display would help the crippled story escape notice. Sorry, guys, the pretty baubles just made the editing and sloppiness of the second half look even worse.The DVD is a bare bones package, but it does have a nice extra 13 scenes deleted from the final cut, including an alternate ending that is much glummer and gloomier than the 'official' one. A few of these scenes are trivial and inessential (including the alternate opening )- but several of them would have added to the coherence and depth of the film quite nicely.Really, I ought to rate Supernova with a 4 or 5, but the glimpses of a much better, much more worthwhile movie kept popping through in the occasional line of dialog, or shot of deep space, or erotic scene, or bit of art direction. lighting and set design. So I feel like it deserves a 7 because it had so much potential - an possible 8 or 9 hobbled with a 3-4 type production difficulties. When will the studios ever learn?

Let's admit it, cops were feerer then to arrest kooky people and ask questions later. Maybe we should go back to that? I'm not really certain how I learned there was a newer version of Cape Fear, but I snatched it up with enthusiasm in memory of the first. I did read, before I saw it, that DeNiro had bulked-up for the role. My hair stood on end from the first scene of DeNiro's tattooed, muscular body. My hair standing on end would have been a fete, because it was and is long. I was in so much shock to see the maniacal look in his eyes, I don't think I was able to make a decision should I or shouldn't I? No chance of me coming out of that trance through-out the entire film, so certain was I that he'd jump-out at any time. If his intention was to let you see the craze simmering beneath the surface, he didn't have to do much to convince me - I saw it! Yes, I did enjoy the mundane scenes with Nolte, Lange and Lewis - they all were terrific in their roles - but, the fear was in me. Reading some of the comments posted here, I now realize that was a messed-up family, pretty-much like today's.

I tried to sympathize with him - from a distance. Had I seen him sitting on my fence, I just may have been scared enough to hire the goons to keep him away. After the family learned for certain he was out to get them, I was amazed Juliette Lewis found it arousing to talk to him on the 'phone - a fascination with danger? - NO WAY would I have gone to meet him alone, not even in a crowded park. I don't think I took one breath the whole time during their scene in the theater. It was brilliant. After she came to her senses to stay away and all those gruesome acts of violence occurred, following a night locked-up in my house, I would have been the one to cut-out, with disguises.I agree that DeNiro's hitching a ride under the car was a bit much - but I still look under mine. And, didn't that lady who saw him go in the restroom and come out with darker hair know there was something a little bit unusual going-on? You can be sure I was in total shock during the entire finale. He couldn't have done anything to hurt me during the scenes inside the boat - I'd have died at his first appearance. All this craziness was entirely appropriate for the maniac he'd become, but it was superb - his death-scene was entirely fitting for such a ranting monster.

Being a mysterious character himself, he metaphorically adds a little color to the film amidst all the spellbinding drama and discloses an entertaining revelation that helps the film progress.This revolutionary masterpiece of craftsmanship is considered by many as the greatest non-US movie ever and it deserves all of its praise entirely. WINGS OF DESIRE breaks new ground in romantic and dramatic film making. Every scene in this movie offers a chance for hope, understanding and compassion. Unbearably creative, outstanding and poignant, this superbly-made motion picture is not another art-house flick. Astounding.WINGS OF DESIRE was remade in Hollywood as the sleek yet disappointing CITY OF ANGELS(1997).

At first I saw the same connections I thought the girls see; but later I interpreted events differently from how I think they do. I'll use a few scenes as examples.At her father's place W wakes in a fright with a vague sense that she's not alone in the world, as if some spirit visits her. Later when she sights V in the square, she seems to have an other-worldly experience, as if this other girl is connected to that spirit. I assumed the same connection; but on watching the movie again, I realized that I had barely noticed something obvious in that scene W is in imminent physical danger of being run over by vehicles and being knocked on the head or arrested by riot police, while V is physically safe and sound on her bus. To have an inner experience on seeing one's double is fine; but at the same time, the sight of her double being safe and sound should encourage W to want to protect her own body and to get out of the square. Instead W reacts in her usual private way, standing in almost a trance as behind her the riot police prepare to move. Run W, run!! As for that other spirit, it is W's way of experiencing and reacting to her chest pains, for which she never seeks medical treatment. But she carefully defends her inner life as she prepares for her concert and tries to avoid her boyfriend Antek. He seems to be of good character, but any love affair can stress the spirit.Beginning with her first scene as a young woman, V vaguely senses some sort of loss in her life. Later the parallel to the scene in the square happens in the hotel room. V vaguely tells the puppeteer Fabbri (F) that she's always sensed there was someone else, and she's always known what to do. When F asks V to tell everything about herself, she promptly empties the contents of her purse onto the bed, then smiles sweetly as he goes through them. When V sees the photo of W that has been in her purse for a long time, V seems quickly to connect the photo with that someone else who has always helped her know what to do, and to connect her sense of loss with the assumed death of that person. I assumed the same connections myself. But after watching again later I paid more attention to some aspects of this scene we can take the contents of her purse as her private inner self, what little she has of one, which she so willingly dumps onto the bed, and which F goes through in a mocking manner, for example, making her crystal ball disappear - much as in an earlier scene he drives off with the angel-spirit on the side of his van. V's private life is under stress as it always is with a lover, even one of good character, which F lacks. To grieve at the assumed death of someone is fine; but the sight of the photo of her double from inside her own purse should encourage V to look within and to take care of her private self. Instead she reacts in her usual material way, imagining a dead body somewhere, and allowing F to enter her with the sort of mechanical sex one sees in bad pornography. Dig in, V, dig in!! As for the loss V senses, it is her was of experiencing and reacting to the withering of her own private life as she glides superficially and mechanically through the motions of her social life. As for her always knowing what to do, it is due to her own keen attention to the outer world and its social conventions - attention that W clearly lacks, though she tries to be kind to people.(BTW some have supposed that F has mysterious insight into some connection between W and V; but he could base his novel on nothing more than what V does and tells him in the hotel room.)W flourishes spiritually while paying the obvious price for never getting medical help for her heart condition. V flourishes materially and socially, but in the end she seems purely mechanical in going through all the right motions she moves the puppet of herself while F controls her; she drives her car to dad's place; she operates its power window to reach to the tree; then she runs like a puppet to dad, who has been working wood with his new sophisticated tool. Each girl succeeds in her own way, but also pays a heavy price for being over-specialized.The many parallels between W and V serve as artistic device to compare and contrast them. But connections between W and V, other than each sighting the other briefly, are not required in this interpretation. For each of the girls that sighting is an awful tease, since she cannot realize how easily the other girl can deal with the current situation, in which she is so unaware and helpless herself. Here is a pair of stories the first is a slight revision that lets each girl survive, and the second brings them together.

Of course the actors job isn't helped by the appalling dialogue and Lucas surpasses even himself in writing some of the most vomit inducing lines ever to be inflicted on an audience. The romance between Anakin and Padme suffers the worst, with some truly cringe worthy scenes that are painful to watch.

The simple fact is the prequel trilogy could and should have surpassed the originals, it has a stronger story, a greater character arc, tragedy and a boot load of action, instead Lucas has frittered it away. The man who's genius bore the story of Star Wars makes a real mess at creating the fall of the republic and the rise of the empire.

The story is like the intersection of a typical hero film, a typical romance, a typical local-boy-and-downtrodden-good-guy comes through in the end, and a cartoon.But the most surprising thing about this movie is that it actually works.What makes it work is Tom Hanks, just about the only actor with the sensitivity and the sense of humor to pull off the role. Nobody in the last 20 years infuses a quirky character with loveability the way Hanks does - Jim Carrey comes close in The Truman Show, but that's about all. Hanks carries this movie the way he carried Punchline and Big, both of which were also incredibly underrated comedies.Watch the way he stands on the deck of the Tweedledee and hesitates before he throws his expensive hat into the ocean - a subtle gesture laden with shockingly deep layers of complexity and character. It's such a stupid detail maybe, but there's so much more to it than that.The second most surprising thing about this movie is that Meg Ryan is actually good. Right before she plunged her entire acting career into the trite, cutie-pie, puppy dog schlock of her cookie-cutter mid-90s romantic comedies, she actually managed to project depth in this movie, not to mention range. She may come off as cartoonish, but she plays three characters differently enough that you actually think they're three different people, right before you laugh at how ridiculous the entire thing is.What I remember most about this movie, though, are the scenes with Joe on the floating luggage raft, where he seems to divide his time equally between the totally silly and the utterly spiritual.

Guilt-ridden, his life changes, and he does all he can to try and save her vision and her. Unfortunately, not only does he have a cop (Danny Lee) following him, but a whole horde of bad guys who have been paid to take him down. This movie absolutely rocks. I can't say it much better than that. Director John Woo seriously knows how to set up action sequences; these are stylish and spectacular.

I knew a lot of people who raved about this film and I do like original quirky films but when I saw it I couldn't embrace it as others did. It's an interesting story of an 80 year old widow who gets her kicks out of looking at the obituaries and selecting funerals to attend as if she were looking for movies to see in the entertainment section of the newspaper. At one of the funerals she meets a 20 year old man who is a loser and they began a unlikely alliance. Ruth Gordon is charming and funny in her role of the elder woman. A revered stage actress she made few films and fewer still where she had a lead role. Bud Cort as a promising young actor had a few films in the 70's beginning with a small role in Robert Altman's M*A*S*H and with Altman again in the starring role in Brewster Mccloud. His career quirky tapered off to supporting cast film roles in mostly forgettable movies and some supporting television roles. Gordon is funny in this film but he is not and his character becomes irritating after a while. This was only the second film from promising director director Hal Ashby. He would fire off a series of good films after Harold And Maude including The Last Detail, Shampoo, Coming Home, Bound for Glory and Being There. Ashby then went through the 1980's making only four forgettable feature films and one documentary and destroyed his health through drug abuse and never re lit the spark he had in the 70's before his untimely death. Screenwriter Collin Higgins turned in a good story here as his career was just beginning. He would go on to write some a handful of good comedies including Silver Streak, Nine to five, Foul Play and The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas before his untimely death. I've seen this a couple times since when I first saw it in about 1974 mainly for the Cat Stevens soundtrack and Ruth Gordon's performance. I would give this a 7.0 out of 10.

The hype for the film was absolutely huge, this was the most anticipated film of all time bar none. The prequels promised to answer so much, like every Star Wars fan I remember watching the original trilogy and dreaming of what the mysterious 'Clone Wars' would be like and who Anakin Skywalker really was, what Obi Wan would be like as a younger man. Unfortunately George Lucas totally failed to create the magic that the first three films had in abundance. Instead of jumping straight into the Clone Wars with an adult Anakin we have to endure a peck kid who's acting is as wooden as an oak table - I don't want to see Darth Vader when he was a sprog he's annoying and not very cool! The story line is turgid and dull from the start, you know your in trouble when the opening crawl talks of tradedisputes. Perhaps dialogue has never been Lucas' strong point but boy does it show here, there's some great actors in this but they all come across stilted and uninterested, the charisma and charm of Han Solo is a distant memory. That's the major downfall of The Phantom Menace, where the original films seemed to have a purpose and zipped along at break neck speed with crackling chemistry this episode is more of a chore. It was so important Lucas got the story right for the opening episode but he makes major misjudgements, by concentrating the whole film on events that ultimately have little to do with the overall story he wastes valuable time, thus ultimately effecting the pacing and characterisation in parts 2 & 3.There are good elements to the movie, Darth Maul and the climatic lightsabre fight at the end for one, but overall it's a crushing disappointment.

If I could turn the clock back to being 13 years old, this might be funny. I can't, and it's not. Sandler is a louder and somewhat more caustic version of Jerry Lewis in the movies he made after the split with Dean Martin. Those movies weren't very good either, but they had a big following and helped make Lewis a ton of cash. Sandler has ripped off the Lewis comedic style; if he has similar investment smarts, he should be set for life and primed to take over the Labor Day Telethon when Lewis finally hangs it up. The only thing I found remotely funny in this film was when Sandler and bus driver John Candy were discussing Veronica Vaughn outside the bus when they were loading up after the field trip. The thing that made the scene funny is that, suddenly, Billy becomes a mature and thoughtful adult who rejects outright the claims of the bus driver concerning Ms. Vaughn's sex life. The scene is laughably clumsy. Like every other Sandler movie, this is mindless nonsense, and if you consider that entertaining, go for it.

It's uneven in places, but it's a towering achievement in animation, especially considering the time in which it was made, and that it was all done completely by hand. It is simply incredible.Be aware, however, that the soundtrack for the DVD release is not quite the same as it was for the 50th anniversary release in 1990, and the VHS and laserdisc releases that followed the next year. The 50th anniversary soundtrack was a faithful and painstaking reproduction of Fantasound using original documents from the Disney archives for the cues, and those who saw it in 1990 at a surround-sound theater will recall the music swirling and jumping around the room at times, making it almost as mind-boggling as what appeared on screen. This is what was encoded on the VHS and laserdisc releases that followed the 50th anniversary release, and those with equipment capable of decoding Dolby 2.0 (Pro-Logic) will hear it with either of those video releases. It was lauded in 1990 as the first time that Fantasound had been heard since 1940, and it is something to behold.The DVD release, however, has an entirely different mix of the musical elements in both Dolby 2.0 and Dolby 5.0. The sound is cleaner than on the 1990 release, but it concentrates everything up front and carries only concert-hall reverb in the rear channels. I've kept my laserdisc copy, and that's the one I watch for the best effect. (The IMDb trivia page for this film has been updated to note this change.)Speaking of the interstitials While I admire Disney's efforts to recreate the original roadshow presentation on the DVD, I think they could have found a better voice match for Deems Taylor. I mean no disrespect to Corey Burton, but while he did an excellent job syncing to the film, his voice has a completely different timbre than Taylor's, and I can't help thinking that someone else could have come closer.BTW, the reason they dubbed Deems Taylor's voice for the DVD is that the interstitials for the original roadshow presentation were trimmed for subsequent releases, including the 50th anniversary release. They found the missing film elements of Taylor's monologues, but their audio elements were lost, and rather than try to dub just those small bits, they re-dubbed the monologues in their entirety.

I will agree with other posters the soundtrack is rather odd. Much of it was filmed in the Chicagoland area, including the two motel scenes. The rental car exchange, while profane, is very funny, as is the you're going the wrong way sequence. Does anyone know if this movie was later edited for length? I remember the airplane scene being longer with a number of laughs that seem to be gone from current version. Missing the airline cook who chopped off his finger, later found on the Singapore run. The woman whose hair falls into Steve Martin's meal. The old hard of hearing guy coughing and being offered a bun, then says, yes flying's fun. These were some of the funniest moments in the film, but now appear to be gone.

So I went to the movie theater expecting a great suspense thriller and left my seat at the end of the movie feeling that I had seen something that totally transcended my expectations. I was totally stunned.While it can be compared to the archetypal horror film because of some of its arguably shoddy scares, the denouement gives it a totally different, much greater magnitude that sets it apart from all mediocre Hollywood horror movies. It meant something more special to me because I didn't go as far as interrogating why Malcolm Crowe was being ignored by his wife and went ahead and assumed that they had a bad breakup or something! The ending gave it all clarity, and it was a darn good twist. It left my mouth hanging open for a few minutes. My friends and I were like, Are you&#133;? Oh my&#133; It was great. I think Haley Joe Osment's acting was excellent also. His eyes were so expressive, I could feel every bit of his terror! This movie haunted me and my friends for months. Every time we had a sleepover after seeing that movie, we would relive our memories of it and freak out all night long. LOL. This did stick with us, it's amazing. Great, great, great film!
