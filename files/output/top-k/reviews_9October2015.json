The movie is just as flawed as I remembered it. There are so many things about it that just don't work.First of all the writing and direction They are just bad. Here is such an interesting subject for a movie and yet they managed to present it in such a boring way. It's slow, during at least half the movie almost nothing happens and we are slowly introduced to very boring and one- dimensional characters and environment.Now, Hilary Swank She is a good actress - I came to like her only from this movie and Million Dollar Baby, which both earned her pretty deserving Oscars. Still, during the entire time I couldn't stop thinking This is Hilary Swank and this is a girl, not a boy. It's usually a very bad sign, when I watch a movie and can't stop thinking about seeing the actual actor and not the character. It's very distracting, too. A movie should be good enough to have the suspension of disbelief make you forget you're watching actors doing their job. I don't know if that's the fault of Hilary Swank (I do think she gave a good performance), or maybe she needed more makeup\/prosthetics or maybe it's a problem with the direction. What I'm quite certain is that she DID need to change her voice - it would have helped a lot.Now compare this movie to Predestination (my favorite movie of 2014), with the brilliant performance of Sarah Snook. I'd take Predestination anytime over Boys Don't Cry. Snook's performance, together with the makeup and prosthetics made an amazing character - it was extremely convincing (at least for me), to the point that I needed to go check IMDb the first time I watched the movie (and thus ruin it a little bit for myself) in order to understand what is going on and find out whether the role is played by two actors or just one. If I'd have to choose between Swank's performance and Snook's performance, I'd definitely choose the latter - it's so much more believable and makes you forget you're watching an actress in makeup even when you know that.Peter Sarsgaard is very good in his poorly-written role and almost unrecognizable; Chloe Sevigny is also very good in her poorly-written role.All in all, this is a very missed opportunity, which could have been made into a MUCH better movie in the hands of more capable writer and director.

I had an idea it would be urban, but I had no idea what the general story and plot was. After first watching Do The Right Thing, I felt obliged to see it more. The premise is very weak and there's no real plot. But Lee wanted it that way and uses it to his advantage. It appears to be about nothing, but as time progresses, you may be caught off guard and blown away.Do The Right Thing takes place one boiling afternoon in a mostly black Brooklyn neighbourhood. There's a few connecting stories that all deal with racism in some form or another. Funny thing is, all of the stories with the characters are so meaningless and shallow. I knew Lee wanted to be real, but real is often boring. But nonetheless, the characters themselves are quite quirky. Lee plays Mookie who works in an Italian pizzeria where he must deal with his pushy boss (Aiello), his boss's son, and his own girlfriend and kid; Da Mayor is an old drunk who just wants peace. He is the one I like the most and the only one who does the right thing in a part of the film without any analyzing; Buggin' Out is a weird looking thug who want's the pizzeria to have African-Americans on the wall instead of famous Italian Americans like John Travolta and Frank Sinatra; a trio of middle-aged men complain about what the neighbourhood has come to; Smiley is mentally challenged and tries to sell photos of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. The dude that plays Smiley does and terrible job of acting and I just want to punch my TV every time he comes on.Each of these little stories have been going on for quite some time and they are pretty low-key when we are introduced to them. In fact, they are so low that they are almost uninteresting. The stories are dull, but the characters aren't. That doesn't last long. Simple tensions in these groups just keep growing and growing into an ending that will leave you completely breathless. It wasn't until about halfway through where I was becoming more compelled with what was happening. But I could not deny how awesome the dialogue was and how great the general filming was. Even when I wasn't very interested, Lee's talent as a filmmaker did not go unrecognized. Lee wanted to show how such small things could have such huge and tragic results. The movie is a statement about racism, violence, misleadings, and loyalty. Everything in this movie is pure art from the creation of the look to the messages. My first watch was an experience I'll never forget. I have seen Do The Right Thing a few times, and I am glad that I now know its idea of little things boiling.I mentioned one character that does the right thing.

Look at all the sports dramas that deal with football, baseball and combat. But those kinds of sports movies are very popular for the typical blue-collar to watch just for fun. Who enjoys watching chess? I love to play chess, but watching it on TV? No thank-you! Searching For Bobby Fischer was a risk and it succeeded in more ways than one.Searching For Bobby Fischer is based on the book by sports journalist, Fred Waitzkin about his son Josh. Josh was just a normal 7-year-old who enjoyed playing with toys and dreamed of being a baseball player. After briefly watching several chess games in a New York park, he decides to play himself. His parents (Mantegna, Allen) see him as a prodigy. They hire a strict teacher (Kingsley) to help Josh hone his craft and tries to guide him to be the next Bobby Fischer. That is what the movie should have been called The Next Bobby Fischer. Searching For Bobby Fischer sounds like the real chess master is involved as a character. This is false advertising if you ask me. Josh is enjoying chess, but the pressure from his dad and teacher become too much for him to bear. Fred mentions that Josh is better at chess than he has ever been at anything. After Josh sees another prodigy in the park who might be better than him, Josh devotes all his time to chess in hopes of making his father proud.In order for a movie with a boring concept to succeed, everything that goes into the film has to be held at high calibre. SFBF does just that. Likewise, the game sequences are actually pretty cool to watch. Searching For Bobby Fischer probably inspired many children to try the game of chess. But I guarantee more than half couldn't fully understand the rules of the game.Ultimately what makes Searching For Bobby Fischer work so well the way it does is the way it shows parents impacting their children. After seeing how talented his young son is, Fred Waitzkin places tremendous pressure on him to be the best chess player in the world. Josh is an innocent kid who just wants to have fun, but also make his father proud of him. That's all any kid wants. Seeing his rival adds more pressure, as Josh thinks losing to another prodigy would lose his father's love. We get a look at who Josh's rival is, and he is going through pretty much a similar path as Josh. Only Josh tries his best keep it all together and we see the characters close to Josh blossom as the movie progresses.

I mean the only movies that I like by him are this, the first Rocky and The Expendables (particularly the second one). But if Stallone starred in movies more like First Blood than just cheesy action movies more about violence than a story, I would watch them more. It tells the story of John Rambo, a veteran who is a former member of elite group of soldiers who fought in the Vietnam War. He is still traumatized from his war experience and doesn't have a home or any friends (since all the other elite solders are dead). Sheriff Teasle then arrests him for vagrancy. But when things get out of hand, Rambo flees and starts terrorizing everything that stands in his path (even without killing them). But his former commander, Colonel Sam Trautman tries to talk some sense into him and stop from what he's doing.

Then you need to watch Saving Private Ryan, directed by Steven Spielberg. This film is magnificent as it provides such realism and such a serious tone throughout the entire film. The movie starts with a reenactment of D-Day, the horrific WWII invasion of Omaha Beach, Normandy in which our country came out victorious in, and shows how truly brutal it really was. As the soldiers progress further onto the beach that they soon take over, a group who is led by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), assembles as they receive another mission. This new mission is to search and rescue Private James Ryan who is apart of a paratrooper platoon that landed in an enemy zone just out of contact. As they are proceeding on this search and rescue mission, they come across numerous issues and initiate a few fire fights along the way. As always, a few of the fellow soldiers die as they come closer to reaching their target and things begin to get more and more out of hand. As they come upon their target, they once again face incredible forces and have to defend themselves until backup arrives. As it comes to an end, they become victorious and control the area they fought for but are faced with a very dramatic outcome. This film really gives you the idea of how intense war really is and just how accurate the outcomes would be like.What's so wonderful about the accuracy of this movie is that it is based on the true events of the Normandy invasion of WWII and shows how gruesome it really was. The landscaping of the beach along with the architectural structures it has prepared was almost ideal to the actual beaches layout. When they go through the movie, scenes where they come across enemy platoons, the way they go about surrendering or killing is very accurate. Whereas some films break out into some huge fake fire fight and start all over. The movie is precise on keeping you intrigued and keeping the tone serious so you will keep watching.Keeping the tone serious keeps the movie going. All the characters in the movie are extremely serious and the language they use show it. It is a war movie so you expect the language and actions to be aggressive and serious and that's exactly what you get. The actions are flawless and the way they go about things, such as the death of fellow soldiers is great. They don't break out and make it a big deal, they put dirt in a can with the name of the dead soldier on it and go about the mission. They went about death very well and stuck together as a unit and kept it very realistic.The realism is what keeps this movie alive. The action is so intense, the gun battles are incredible, and the sound effects are just phenomenal and bass dropping. The sounds of the different weaponry are so realistic tying into the accuracy and acting of the film. The gore and blood of some battles may be disturbing to certain viewers because it's so brutal and gruesome.Overall, I would recommend the movie Private Ryan, for all movie lovers. The accuracy of the actual events that transpired on Omaha Beach were historical. The seriousness of the actors portraying the soldiers in my opinion, is done with respect and honor. Honor to all the soldiers who lost their lives that day defending our country. As you are watching the battle scenes the realism in the acting, sound effects, and special effects, makes you feel like you could be right there on the battlefield with the soldiers.

It's heart-warming that the kind Peg shows passion to a completely strange person and it's fun seeing Edward show his skills and tricks to the community, from him making grass sculptures to giving the women haircuts with his scissorhands.It is also nice seeing the chemistry between Edward and Kim (Winona Ryder), brilliantly played and uplifting, and the friction between Edward and Kim's boyfriend (Anthony Michael Hall) eventually leads to the more serious misadventures and bad doers in the movie. But, this film shows us that humanity and understanding exist in the world and kind souls do prevail over evil in some way, even though ***spoiler ahead*** not all stories end up happily ever after. I just wished some of the evil-doers got a taste of their own medicine and Edward got cut with some more slack ***spoiler ends*** Overall, it's a film with great acting, great music score by Danny Elfman, great direction by Tim Burton and a well-paced story.Grade A- ","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"},{"date":"9 October 2015","score":"","review":" This is one film you will have to suspend reality and let your imagination run wild with. Tim Burton directs one of his most iconic films, a story about a man named Edward (Johnny Depp) who was created by a scientist who left him unfinished, leaving Edward a near-complete man with scissors for hands.Edward lives in isolation in a mysterious, dark castle on top of a mountain, which overlooks a quiet, simple, Utopia-like suburb.

I offered to give him the DVD when I was finished with it. He said fine, but he thought that The Rocky Horror Picture Show was better as a stage show. God only knows it's revived often enough and has been taken to heart as a cult item with shows in just about every where there's a visible LGBT community. In fact I know at least one person who in Toronto every year plays Dr. Frank N. Furter in a production.The three leads in fact saw their breakout performances in this science fiction parody which takes its plot partly from the Frankenstein story and from the Island of Dr. Moreau. Having Mary Shelley and H.G. Wells as inspiration gives you a good start.Young couple Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon get themselves lost and wind up at the home of mad cross dressing scientist Dr. Frank N. Furter played by Tim Curry. If you've seen both those classic films than you have some idea of the story line.I'll say this if Dr. Frankenstein was gay Peter Hinwood would be exactly what he would dream up for an artificially created man. Whatever happened to him?The musical numbers performed stylishly by drag performers are staged well. And certainly the pyrotechnics are probably better seen in a live production.So I guess I'll have to take my friend's comment and judge that for myself.
