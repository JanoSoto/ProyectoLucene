[{"date":"6 December 2013","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Claiming to be also a poor victim of those wrongful accusations of rape, this French personality just proved the contrary and highlights what gossip is a distorted truth. Indeed, a gossip relies most of the time upon a real fact but after being told endlessly, the exact meaning is a bit lost. To put it with fun, it's the story of the man that says that he have seen the man who saw the man who saw the man who saw the bear. This movie at first illustrates clearly this definition but soon it turns more as a criminal investigation. Thus, the promised study about the social effect of a gossip isn't totally fulfilled. A second disappointment concerns the way of life of those roommates they live in an incredible flat that is totally implausible for normal students. At last, the ending is terribly stupid as it's totally unbelievable to think a so big scheme to catch a so little fly! The cast may be good but again i can't buy Lena still being in college! In conclusion, it's difficult to really believe in the movie and it's problematic as it's the core of the subject!
