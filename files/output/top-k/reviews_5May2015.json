Some of them I still like just because of the nostalgia feel--I don't think I would have liked some if I saw them for the first time today. Max Keeble's Big Move is not one of those. I think I would have loved this movie regardless of my age and intellect. This movie feature a few stars along with future stars that were still making their names. It stars Home Alone 3's Alex D Linz as the title character and a fat Josh Peck as his best friend Robe. Because I love this movie so much, I may always see Peck as a fat nerd. It also features Larry Miller, Nora Dunn, Jamie Kennedy, Zena Grey, Orlando Brown, Noel Fisher and Robert Carradine. The movie is about Max entering the 7th grade, where he must be subjected to bullies, peer pressure and an odd faculty. Max's salesman father (Carradine) gets news that he must move to Chicago and Max is shocked. But he soon sees it as an opportunity to enact revenge on all those wrong with the school. Things take a turn for the worst when the school suffers even more and Max finds out he doesn't have to move after all. Uh-oh!The first thing this has that is needed for a bully movie is the sense of realism and comedy. Max Keeble is able to find the perfect balance between these. The comedy never runs out of fuel and it is there to make everything that much better. Max's plans for revenge are so funny and genius. There's one scene where he starts a food fight to make Principal Jindrake (Miller) look bad. I would honestly say it is the best food fight ever filmed; better than Animal House, Problem Child 2 and others. There's many other scenes that make this wonderful.Max Keeble was back in the days when characters in family movies were made with such depth and like-ability. Max is a preteen who is trying to figure out the world and think he is doing well, when it really just makes everything worse for everybody. These characters give good lessons on bullying, revenge and egos. Just because he thinks he won't be there to be punished, Max let's his whole revenge scheme get to his head and thinks he's the greatest. All he did was stoop to the other bullies' level, making him the worst of them all. What happens to Max is very common. I could relate to all characters, not just Max.

Also along for the ride are a jewel thief and the ship's owner and captain. The rest of the story plays out as a survival saga as our heroes fight their way off the ship through superior fire power and lots of exploding sea creature anatomy.This film has been a favorite of mine since i first saw it luckily, back in February 1998 during it's original theatrical run. I'm a huge fan of monster movies and action pictures, so to see a film that combined the two so seamlessly and inventively was a treat. The special effects are top notch with good practical effects work from Rob Bottin of John Carpenter's The Thing fame. Special mention should be given to the half digested man scene which to this day still gives me the creeps. The creature is a well realized menace of pure aquatic terror, resembling a mix between a T-Rex, octopus, snake, and starfish, it truly resembles something one would not want to encounter in real life but also an original beast, one which has it's own uniqueness and personality which hasn't been seen on the big screen since. The CGI to bring the creature to life is great and as good as anything seen in Jurassic Park. The tentacle effects, especially the scenes depicting their movement throughout the ship in pipes and hallways, has a sense of realism rarely seen in monster pictures, the way they slither like a snake and slowly crawl towards their victims before eating them shows a sign in intelligence not just in the main body in the creature but in the the individual parts as well. It's like the tentacles have brains of their own. Besides the effects of the film, which still hold up to this day, the production design and art direction are spectacular, the interior of the ship is incredibly detailed, with the ship before the monster's arrival looking like a luxury resort, filled with bars, a massive staircase, a casino, and a stage area on the main floor, it truly is a paradise on the high seas. I especially like all the touches of Chinese memorabilia and history sprinkled throughout the party room where all the activity of the ship is held. The sets of the ship being abandoned and the halls of the ship being flooded also are well done and do a nice job of showing the geography of the ship and just how massive it truly is. Regarding the performances, special mention must be made of Treat Williams very entertaining Han Solo sequel performance as John Finnegan. Williams brings so much swagger, charm, and self-awareness to the role that u enjoy spending time in his company and hope he makes it to the end in one peace. He also holds his own in the films action sequences especially in a very neat homage to Terminator 2 towards the end of the film involving him, a jet ski, closed elevator doors, and a shotgun. It's very unrealistic and over the top but who cares it' s a hell of a lot a fun. The supporting cast is excellent especially Famke Janssen as the thief\/love interest to Williams character. She's a strong female character who holds her own with the men. Kevin J O Connor is funny as Williams comic relief sidekick. Anthony Heald as the owner of the ship has fun as a slimy villain. The actors who play the mercenaries all are good and memorable and have a few bits of funny dialogue during their characters introduction scene. Everyone who was apart of this film seemed to be having a blast making it, which shows in the final film, making it easier for me as an audience member to want to go on the ride. The writing in the film is top notch and is filled to the brim with funny one liners. The direction is just as good, Stephen Sommers the man who would later bring us the Brendan Fraser mummy movies and Van Helsing, knows the kind of film he is making and just goes for broke delivering a completely satisfying monster action movie. He doesn't waste time on needless exposition on what the monster is or where it came from. He directs action well and keeps the film moving at a brisk pace. The look of the film also is of note with almost the entire setting taking place during a thunderstorm, surrounded by pouring rain and low hanging clouds which give the film an ominous atmosphere, further pushing the idea the sense of danger and isolation in which our characters find themselves. So wrapping up my thoughts I love this movie it's a fun and fast paced thrill ride with good performances, solid direction, a cool and unique creature, and last but not least features one of the coolest movie guns ever put to celluloid (the M1-L1 triple pulse rifle is something to behold). It goes without saying I highly recommend this film and will continue to watch it for many years to come, hopefully with my review I can bring more awareness to the film's existence and it can grow a bigger cult following, it deserves it. So thanks for reading my review and good day.

I'll get to its place in history in a minute, but first I'll say that for me this film is kind of a big deal since it introduced me to the world of classical music, a world that's becoming increasingly hard to convey to today's youths. Anyway, this film was my entry point into classical music and I haven't looked back since.Unsurprisingly, Amadeus is about Mozart, more or less. It's about Mozart as seen through the eyes of another composer, Antonio Salieri. We see Salieri as an old man in an insane asylum when a priest comes to visit him. Salieri then recounts his life, how he met Mozart, etc. He tells the priest that, through a fortunate turn of events (including his father's death&#x85;), he was able to travel to Vienna, 'city of musicians'. He was successful there, wanting to create music in service to God. All was well until he met Mozart. Salieri was confronted with a composer who far exceeded his abilities. Salieri believed God was talking through Mozart's music and Salieri realized his own music paled in comparison. This was a shock to Salieri which was only amplified by the fact that Mozart was a 'sensual' man, a lover of sex and wine, etc. Why, Salieri asked himself, had God made this 'monkey' his instrument instead of me? The rest of the film shows Salieri and Mozart conversing and trying to get through their careers and lives, with Salieri desperately trying to conceal not only his passion for Mozart's music, but also his hatred for the man.I could spend several paragraphs swooning over the film's technical achievements (which are vast) and the quality of the acting (which is great), but I'd rather discuss something else, something I believe is the key to this film's success. What I find the most intriguing thing about Amadeus is the fact that it was still massively successful (winning 8 Oscars) despite not being historically accurate at all. Granted, not all historical films need to follow the history books to the letter to be successful, but the amount of changes that were made in Amadeus were pretty substantial. You can look up various articles detailing the differences. I'll name one Mozart's laugh which, as you may recall, was kind of funny&#x85;or annoying&#x85;your mileage may vary. As seen in the trivia section on IMDb, 'there are claims that the laugh was taken from references in letters written about him'. A quote by Robert L. Marshall follows stating there is no historical evidence that Mozart had such a laugh. Its use in the film is purely dramatic, because Salieri sees it as the gods mocking him.So yeah, the film deviates quite a lot from reality, but I think these deviations and the way Amadeus turned out are precisely the reason why the film was so impactful at the time, as it was for me when I saw it in my early teens. The reason it was so successful (and still is) despite all the historical errors is because in the end it isn't really a biographical film, but a film about the people behind the music. It doesn't merely throw classical music at you and telling you to like it, but it shows Salieri obsessed with the transcendent nature of music and his frustration when he realizes he doesn't have what Mozart has. The film conveys the notion of music being capable of expressing the inexpressible. This is why scenes like Salieri salivating over Mozart's 'originals' have endured the test of time, because it's not just about the music. It's about the people behind it. This is where I think a documentary would have failed. Sure, it would have painted a more historically accurate portrait of Salieri and Mozart, but film is more easily capable of delivering an emotional impact. Instead of merely showing the lives of Salieri and Mozart, the central focus is their (particularly Salier's) obsession with (Mozart's) music. By telling the story through Salieri, we see Mozart through his eyes and we too are baffled and amazed by Mozart's genius. This is what Amadeus does right more than anything introduce audiences to classical music in a way that captures the imagination. That's what it did for me. Like I said, this was my entry to classical music. In a spur of the moment, I told my parents I was going to compose a requiem like Mozart did. Naturally, I never did. I know little music theory and never seriously composed anything. It was a spur-of-the-moment thing, but the important thing was that Amadeus made me that excited about classical music. I too wanted to experience the level of excitement and transcendence that Salieri experienced through Mozart's music.This all reminds me of Leonard Bernstein. He's of course considered to be one of the great conductors, but what I think proves that claim more than anything was his ability to convey his passion to the audience. Just watching him conduct is an experience in and of itself. Again it's not necessarily the music itself that excites, but the people who bring it to life and it's this major achievement of Amadeus that makes it a classic and a must-watch. Well&#x85;there it is.

I'll get to its place in history in a minute, but first I'll say that for me this film is kind of a big deal since it introduced me to the world of classical music, a world that's becoming increasingly hard to convey to today's youths. Anyway, this film was my entry point into classical music and I haven't looked back since.Unsurprisingly, Amadeus is about Mozart, more or less. It's about Mozart as seen through the eyes of another composer, Antonio Salieri. We see Salieri as an old man in an insane asylum when a priest comes to visit him. Salieri then recounts his life, how he met Mozart, etc. He tells the priest that, through a fortunate turn of events (including his father's death&#x85;), he was able to travel to Vienna, 'city of musicians'. He was successful there, wanting to create music in service to God. All was well until he met Mozart. Salieri was confronted with a composer who far exceeded his abilities. Salieri believed God was talking through Mozart's music and Salieri realized his own music paled in comparison. This was a shock to Salieri which was only amplified by the fact that Mozart was a 'sensual' man, a lover of sex and wine, etc. Why, Salieri asked himself, had God made this 'monkey' his instrument instead of me? The rest of the film shows Salieri and Mozart conversing and trying to get through their careers and lives, with Salieri desperately trying to conceal not only his passion for Mozart's music, but also his hatred for the man.I could spend several paragraphs swooning over the film's technical achievements (which are vast) and the quality of the acting (which is great), but I'd rather discuss something else, something I believe is the key to this film's success. What I find the most intriguing thing about Amadeus is the fact that it was still massively successful (winning 8 Oscars) despite not being historically accurate at all. Granted, not all historical films need to follow the history books to the letter to be successful, but the amount of changes that were made in Amadeus were pretty substantial. You can look up various articles detailing the differences. I'll name one Mozart's laugh which, as you may recall, was kind of funny&#x85;or annoying&#x85;your mileage may vary. As seen in the trivia section on IMDb, 'there are claims that the laugh was taken from references in letters written about him'. A quote by Robert L. Marshall follows stating there is no historical evidence that Mozart had such a laugh. Its use in the film is purely dramatic, because Salieri sees it as the gods mocking him.So yeah, the film deviates quite a lot from reality, but I think these deviations and the way Amadeus turned out are precisely the reason why the film was so impactful at the time, as it was for me when I saw it in my early teens. The reason it was so successful (and still is) despite all the historical errors is because in the end it isn't really a biographical film, but a film about the people behind the music. It doesn't merely throw classical music at you and telling you to like it, but it shows Salieri obsessed with the transcendent nature of music and his frustration when he realizes he doesn't have what Mozart has. The film conveys the notion of music being capable of expressing the inexpressible. This is why scenes like Salieri salivating over Mozart's 'originals' have endured the test of time, because it's not just about the music. It's about the people behind it. This is where I think a documentary would have failed. Sure, it would have painted a more historically accurate portrait of Salieri and Mozart, but film is more easily capable of delivering an emotional impact. Instead of merely showing the lives of Salieri and Mozart, the central focus is their (particularly Salier's) obsession with (Mozart's) music. By telling the story through Salieri, we see Mozart through his eyes and we too are baffled and amazed by Mozart's genius. This is what Amadeus does right more than anything introduce audiences to classical music in a way that captures the imagination. That's what it did for me. Like I said, this was my entry to classical music. In a spur of the moment, I told my parents I was going to compose a requiem like Mozart did. Naturally, I never did. I know little music theory and never seriously composed anything. It was a spur-of-the-moment thing, but the important thing was that Amadeus made me that excited about classical music. I too wanted to experience the level of excitement and transcendence that Salieri experienced through Mozart's music.This all reminds me of Leonard Bernstein. He's of course considered to be one of the great conductors, but what I think proves that claim more than anything was his ability to convey his passion to the audience.

Needless to say, it was an impactful experience. American History X is without a doubt an emotionally charged experience, but the way it's all handled is also ironically where I feel things go a bit wrong.It's nighttime. Danny (Edward Furlong) is trying to sleep, but his older brother Derek (Edward Norton) having loud sex with his girlfriend is keeping him up. Suddenly, he notices a few black men trying to steal Derek's car. He alerts Derek who, armed with nothing but his boxers and a handgun, kills one of the men, shoots another one and tries to shoot at the remaining one driving away, but to no avail. Danny, seeing what his brother wrought, looks at Derek while he walks angrily toward the black man he wounded earlier. The film then cuts to the present, shot in color (as opposed to the B\/W flashbacks), as Danny meets with the principal due to him writing a paper on Hitler's Mein Kampf. The principal (Avery Brooks), who also used to be Derek's teacher, tries to explain to Danny that it's Derek, now serving a prison sentence, who made him this way, but he doesn't get through to him. Instead, he gives him a new assignment to write a paper on his brother. The film then crosscuts between flashbacks to how Derek became a neo-Nazi skinhead, how he got incarcerated, etc. and the present, showing Danny and Derek, who has changed his ways while in prison, trying to make it in their day-to-day lives.It's to director Tony Kaye's credit that the film is the emotional journey it is. He makes extensive use of dramatic orchestral and choral music (courtesy of Anne Dudley), slow-motion and black-and-white photography to enhance the drama and he mostly succeeds. Also great are Norton and Furlong's performances who not only excel in their individual scenes, but exhibit a chemistry in their scenes together, a sense that these are indeed two brothers who've lived together.I do have a few issues with the film however. It has an unhealthy tendency to give a lot of screen time to neo-Nazi ideology. We of course know that the filmmakers are not proponents of this ideology through the existence of characters like the benevolent principal Sweeney, the black inmate Lamont and the evil skinhead leader Cameron, the subplot of how Derek became a neo-Nazi (he was fueled more by anger than ideology and was subsequently easily manipulated by Cameron), the fact that principal Sweeney came to visit Derek in prison after Derek was raped by skinheads because he befriended Lamont and tells him that he cannot run away, thus ensuring the safety of his family, but that he has to stay with them and try to make amends. Make no mistake, the film doesn't in any way portray neo-Nazis as good, but the incessant focus on discussions with Derek spouting racist ideology are strange in that you realize the film actually seems to spend more time there than providing a balanced view and social context. I know it's an unfair comparison, but remember The Wire? That series spent countless hours (which a film doesn't have obviously) explaining the complex cyclical relationship between the police and criminals. It gave insight into the hopeless prospects of many poor blacks and showed how sometimes joining a gang is the only viable option. Despite the fact that American History X isn't fundamentally racist, it doesn't give us enough social context to get rid of that nagging feeling that things could've been more balanced.Also relevant is that apparently the film's ending is an alternate one. Instead of hearing the dead Danny quote Lincoln's 1861 Inaugural Address, we would see Derek unable to deal with Danny's death and shaving his head, thus becoming a skinhead again. This would then tie the whole plot together and show how the film's really about 'the endless cycle of violence'. But, at least according to IMDb's trivia page, this was altered after Norton objected. I can see why as that would've been an even more hopeless ending, but I wonder if the original ending wouldn't have been better. As it is, we see Derek and Danny truly bonding after which Danny is shot by the same black boy he insulted earlier. The film thus ends with blacks being the aggressors which results in the white characters we've come to know and understand either being dead or emotionally traumatized. We can't really look at it from the boy's point of view either, because the film doesn't grant us context about his way of life, save for a shocked close-up of his face as he realizes what he's done. Again, like the film's excessive focus on racist ideology, this ending leaves a bad taste in one's mouth, despite Danny's quote about how 'hate is baggage', etc. At least Derek going skinhead again would have softened the racist angle and strengthened the 'cycle of violence' point of view.All in all, it's hard to summarize my feelings toward American History X. I appreciate all the potent melodrama director Kaye and screenwriter McKenna create, I like Derek's character development, principal Sweeney, Lamont, etc., but I can't help but feel the film should have provided a more balanced social context à la The Wire.

Even for his small amount of films, Kubrick has been known for his variety, but even audiences back in the day must've been surprised to see him tackle a costume drama. But since it's Kubrick, we're obviously not dealing with just any costume drama&#x85; After being treated to a particularly dramatic performance of Handel's Sarabande, the film opens with protagonist Redmond Barry's father being shot in a duel. Barry falls in love with his cousin Nora, but though she shows interest in him, she plans to marry a rich English Captain. Frustrated, Barry shoots the Captain and is forced to flee to Dublin. The film follows his trials and tribulations as he roams the countryside in search of fortune, eventually makes a name for himself, but by that time the demeaning sides of his personality ensure his inevitable ruin.A curious thing indeed to see Kubrick tackle the costume drama genre. The trick, however, is to remember what Kubrick's all about. What is one of the key themes that defines pretty much every one of his films?

Although sequels were planned to follow HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION, Dimension Films decided that it was best to later reboot the film series with Rob Zombie's remake of the 1978 of the original HALLOWEEN film.The film is set three years after the last film with Laurie being put in a psychiatric hospital after mistakingly killing a doctor who she thought was her brother. Laurie sets a trap, but successfully, after twenty years of tracking her down, Michael eventually kills her.The following year, the movie goes from here. It continues with the masked serial killer Michael Myers continuing his murderous rampage in his hometown of Haddonfield, but this time, in his old childhood home, now derelict, which is being used for a live internet horror show. Just like the last film, Halloween Resurrection insists that the fourth, fifth and sixth installments are not canon.I don't hate this film, but I can see why other people do. I will not explain anything bad because everything about this movie is so great.The acting is fantastic, but I will say, I was sad that Laurie Strode was killed off at the beginning of this movie. Jamie Lee Curtis is good in the screen time her character has and she does an incredible job in her last appearance as Laurie Strode.Bianca Kajlich plays Sara and she is amazing in this film.

In this film Ferris Bueller, played by Matthew Broderick , is a high school student who has a knack for playing hooky. Knowing that this may be his last time he can skip school he develops an elaborate plan to pull it off. Ferris, along with his friend Cameron Frye, played by Alan Ruck, and his girlfriend Sloane Peterson, played by Mia Sara, head to Chicago for the day. As they ditch school they have to stay one step ahead of their principle Ed Rooney, played by Jeffrey Jones, and Ferris' sister Jeanie Bueller, played by Jennifer Grey.The theme from this film has to be to live life to the fullest and make the most of everyday. Ferris Bueller is a character who makes the best of everything and encourages his friends to do the same. If not for Ferris Bueller, Cameron may not have worked up the courage to confront his father about their relationship and Jeanie Bueller may not have found a new respect for Ferris and discover she needs to start focusing more on herself. In a way, this film reminds me of the film The Breakfast Club. Both films are about high school students dealing with a villainous principle who in the end, discover more about themselves than they ever knew before.Dialog and music are two important techniques used in this film. The music selected heightens the suspenseful moments well and aids the quick cutting speed found throughout the film. The dialog of the film is an under-appreciated aspect. Ferris' sharp and outlandish reasoning is something that can only be appreciated. There are many great techniques used throughout this film but the dialog and music proved to be key. Both of these techniques play into the theme of the film, which is live it up to the fullest. The music selected was always boisterous and lightened and the dialog throughout the film is constantly about loosening up and having fun. In all, this is a great film and one that can be viewed over and over again.

Ferris, along with his friend Cameron Frye, played by Alan Ruck, and his girlfriend Sloane Peterson, played by Mia Sara, head to Chicago for the day. As they ditch school they have to stay one step ahead of their principle Ed Rooney, played by Jeffrey Jones, and Ferris' sister Jeanie Bueller, played by Jennifer Grey.The theme from this film has to be to live life to the fullest and make the most of everyday. Ferris Bueller is a character who makes the best of everything and encourages his friends to do the same. If not for Ferris Bueller, Cameron may not have worked up the courage to confront his father about their relationship and Jeanie Bueller may not have found a new respect for Ferris and discover she needs to start focusing more on herself. In a way, this film reminds me of the film The Breakfast Club. Both films are about high school students dealing with a villainous principle who in the end, discover more about themselves than they ever knew before.Dialog and music are two important techniques used in this film. The music selected heightens the suspenseful moments well and aids the quick cutting speed found throughout the film. The dialog of the film is an under-appreciated aspect. Ferris' sharp and outlandish reasoning is something that can only be appreciated. There are many great techniques used throughout this film but the dialog and music proved to be key. Both of these techniques play into the theme of the film, which is live it up to the fullest.

Please great action pop out scares one of the best foot chases before Casino Royale yet 6.4? It does start quite slowly but that is how film's used to be before the Man of Steel template. You know start right off kung fu explosions yelling running screaming all the wonderful features that make current movies such a treat. Yes I know this will seem strange back in the 80s we had this really boring thing called character and plot development no doubt this is why it did so badly. The Pacific Rim crowd that likes lots of giant exploding robots and non stop yelling will be very disappointed. Connery and Boyle carry the movie. Boyle was always as greatly underrated actor as his no talent daughter is overrated. I recommend viewers to that rare treat FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE. Boyle is the villain in that film and here he really shines as a real creep who is poisoning workers with a synthetic drug that makes them work much harder right before they go crazy. All in the name of greater profits of course. O Niel wrecks this and Sheppard makes killing O Niel his mission in life. Dr Lazarus played by frances sternhagen almost steals the movie with great sour one liners and shows why she is the only reason to watch the dreadful Doc Hollywood. James Sikking as Montone turns in a great performance with a great pop out scare. The byplay between O niel and Sheppard is one the highlights of the picture great to see two old pros together after suffering though Prometheus a slight drop off in acting quality. The film is quite intense and Hyams is no slouch at drama and suspense. Yes I know he did Capricorn One and End of Days but he did produce great suspenseful scenes here. It was outshone by the dreadful and overrated 2010 this is his best film by miles. There are a few flaws of course his wife and son are played by just awful actors. The weird bar with the mating figures was as bizarre then as it is now really do not now what Hyams is doing except trying to give the bar a blue collar feel. Frankly every time O Niel is speaking to his wife or son the movie comes to a complete stop. It really was a big mistake by Hyams first they cannot act and they are painful to watch. It wrecks the tension and is quite a bore. If you are looking for special effects sorry this is 1981. They did the best they could some scenes are quite well done like when he is outside in his suit others like the badly drawn mattes of Jupiter are quite awful.

Coincidence or not, the main character of Harper Stewart (Taye Diggs) is a writer as well, and references to Hughes and Wright are in the film. Harper has just had his first novel published, has a beautiful girlfriend (Saana Lathan), and seems to have it all together. He's nervous about commitment and the reaction to his book, which serves as a fictional interpretation of his young adult life. Harper is certainly justified in his worry, as he doesn't pull any punches, and once the real versions of his characters read what he's written about them, he has to face his mistakes and be, literally, the best man he can be.The film centers around one whirlwind weekend that has the four main characters reminiscing in advance of Lance Sullivan's (Morris Chestnut) wedding. Lance is a pro footballer, engaged to Mia (Monica Calhoun), who has stood by him despite his egregious lack of fidelity. My guess is that Mia doesn't even know the half of it. Lance is a classic alpha male- he's so strong in body and belief, but cannot make the connection between his steadfast conviction and keeping it in his pants. So, like many men, he's a 'dog'. Harper is a 'dog' in a different way- he's sneaky in his selfishness, and takes those that love him for granted. Quentin (Terrence Howard) is a knowing, world-weary 'dog'- he's been around the block, has known his share of disappointments, and brings balance to this group of friends. Howard's turn here (the first I was exposed to him) lends gravity to the film- he's the one who knows what's going to go down once the dirty laundry is aired, because he's already gone through the maturation process that the other three haven't. Murch (Harold Perrineau from 'Lost') is the spineless 'dog'. He clearly lacks the confidence to stand up for himself, and therefore doesn't have what he really wants.As I mentioned before, Carver's influence is present, intentional or not. It's never more evident than the poker game our main group shares, and the way the characters interact. What is said during this particular scene provides deep insights into gender roles, relationships, sex, religion, honesty, and loyalty- all within a 10 minute scene. The men may talk crudely, but the truths are clear. These men are good, caring people, but have done selfish things. No amount of aggression can keep the powerful truths from coming out, truths that Harper's book give away. It says something for a film that might be seen as a traditional rom-com that instead says something about really becoming a man.Without giving away everything, let's just say that eventually it hits the fan. By then, we're so invested in the characters that the reactions from all involved seem justified. Lance must face the music in the most powerful way- in the moment that should be his greatest, he's finally humbled for his indiscretions. Perhaps it's Morris Chesnut's performance, or maybe the script is that good, but in that moment I felt both a satisfaction and a sadness for his character's punishment. Quentin is finally rewarded by the film for being the 'cool, level-headed' one that leads the characters towards the truth, Murch grows a pair and gracefully moves on from his overbearing, confidence-sucking girl, and Harper? He's forced to be self- reflective, to recognize the good in his life, the need versus the want, and to not take things for granted. All of the character arcs, including the females, make sense in their conclusions. It's something that can only happen when a filmmaker cares enough about the characters. Most adults have been through similar life events and the emotions that go with them; this movie respects its audience enough to challenge them with specific thoughts about manhood, relationships, change, and the like. It's rare for that to happen, but it's what Carver's book did, and what this film does as well.Sure, there are some problems with the film. For whatever reason, the script requires these characters to have the most bombastic and presidential names, insisting that they say those full names over and over for the first quarter of the film. It's overtly obvious that Malcolm Lee thought it necessary to establish these people as successful, professional, driven individuals to distance this film from others released in the same vein. Unfortunately it comes across as awkward; they're the kind of names little girls give to tea party guests. Harper Stewart. Jordan Armstrong. Lance Sullivan. Julian Murch. Shelby. Robyn. Mia Morgan. Candace. There's something&#x85;off about that. As well, the perfunctory and impromptu proposal by our lead seems oddly misplaced, especially considering his apparent understanding of the situation; I'm not sure that a humbled character like Harper should be leaping back into the fire he just escaped.Obviously I forgive the film that minor slip. It's important to note that this cost 9 million to make in 1999. Considering that many of the cast members have continued working since then, many successfully, and considering this film's appeal why not revisit the characters? It's a good opportunity when it normally wouldn't exist for a romantic comedy, and I'm looking forward to seeing how these characters have progressed 15 years later when The Best Man Holiday comes out.

It's important to note that this cost 9 million to make in 1999. Considering that many of the cast members have continued working since then, many successfully, and considering this film's appeal why not revisit the characters?

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"5 May 2015","score":"","review":" The Best Man is the closest thing to Raymond Carver's work that I've seen on film, and that's a great compliment to pay. Coincidence or not, the main character of Harper Stewart (Taye Diggs) is a writer as well, and references to Hughes and Wright are in the film. Harper has just had his first novel published, has a beautiful girlfriend (Saana Lathan), and seems to have it all together. He's nervous about commitment and the reaction to his book, which serves as a fictional interpretation of his young adult life. Harper is certainly justified in his worry, as he doesn't pull any punches, and once the real versions of his characters read what he's written about them, he has to face his mistakes and be, literally, the best man he can be.The film centers around one whirlwind weekend that has the four main characters reminiscing in advance of Lance Sullivan's (Morris Chestnut) wedding. Lance is a pro footballer, engaged to Mia (Monica Calhoun), who has stood by him despite his egregious lack of fidelity. My guess is that Mia doesn't even know the half of it. Lance is a classic alpha male- he's so strong in body and belief, but cannot make the connection between his steadfast conviction and keeping it in his pants. So, like many men, he's a 'dog'. Harper is a 'dog' in a different way- he's sneaky in his selfishness, and takes those that love him for granted. Quentin (Terrence Howard) is a knowing, world-weary 'dog'- he's been around the block, has known his share of disappointments, and brings balance to this group of friends. Howard's turn here (the first I was exposed to him) lends gravity to the film- he's the one who knows what's going to go down once the dirty laundry is aired, because he's already gone through the maturation process that the other three haven't. Murch (Harold Perrineau from 'Lost') is the spineless 'dog'. He clearly lacks the confidence to stand up for himself, and therefore doesn't have what he really wants.As I mentioned before, Carver's influence is present, intentional or not. It's never more evident than the poker game our main group shares, and the way the characters interact. What is said during this particular scene provides deep insights into gender roles, relationships, sex, religion, honesty, and loyalty- all within a 10 minute scene. The men may talk crudely, but the truths are clear. These men are good, caring people, but have done selfish things. No amount of aggression can keep the powerful truths from coming out, truths that Harper's book give away. It says something for a film that might be seen as a traditional rom-com that instead says something about really becoming a man.Without giving away everything, let's just say that eventually it hits the fan. By then, we're so invested in the characters that the reactions from all involved seem justified. Lance must face the music in the most powerful way- in the moment that should be his greatest, he's finally humbled for his indiscretions. Perhaps it's Morris Chesnut's performance, or maybe the script is that good, but in that moment I felt both a satisfaction and a sadness for his character's punishment.

He proceeds to kill at random, striking at country homes and trailer parks. An American writer doing research on ancient religious sites becomes involved in taking down Rawhead after the monster kills his own son.Generally speaking, the acting is decent in the film, and the setting of the simple Irish town is well realized. The music, composed by Colin Towns, is awesome. As for the overall delivery of the story, well...like a lot of horror movies, it's a cool premise, and the story has potential, but a lot of problems end up marring the experience.Part of the problem is the use of the monster. Rex is pretty much exposed in his full form just about seven minutes into the movie - no build up to the exposure, no suspense about this mysterious thing in the dark, nothing. He pops out of the ground, lifting up his arms and crying out right in front of the camera...and it's not scary. In fact, he looks like a professional wrestler making his entrance. I seriously expected John Cena's theme music to start playing in that scene. It's like taking out the build up of a joke and cutting straight to the punchline; there's something lost in the process.Another problem is how the monster looks. For one, the reason he's called Rawhead in the original story is because his head looked like raw meat. The monster in the film, by contrast, looks like an orc from some fantasy movie. I can see why Clive Barker later said he was unhappy by how the monster came across in the movie. For another, the costume looks like something designed for quick close ups or mid shots, rather than prolonged long shorts or action scenes. In some sequences (such as when Rawhead attacks the little boy, or when Rawhead slashes about in the church), it comes across way too obvious that it's a guy in a suit, given how little Rawhead's face moves aside from his mouth.Perhaps one surprising fault was all the clichés or tropes in this movie. You have the lovers out kissing who encounter the monster. You have the police who are annoyingly dense and hostile to the hero's common sense. You have a girl who gets her clothes ripped off by Rawhead for no discernible reason other than we need those bare breasts. And of course, the ending gives you the typical monster cliché of OH HEY THE MONSTER'S NOT REALLY DEAD! DERPY DOO! There's absolutely no purpose to the latter - it's like someone said, Hey! We need to put that in there! Because if a horror movie needs anything, it's an overused jump scare at the end! All these clichés were especially shocking for me because one of Clive Barker's other films, Hellraiser, is one of my favorite horror movies precisely because it's so original and unique.It also doesn't help that a lot of things explained in the original story aren't really explained here, or it adds things that aren't satisfactorily explained. Why does Declan automatically join Rawhead? Never explained. What's the deal with Rawhead urinating on people? Never explained. Why is Rawhead so afraid of pregnant woman, and what's the backstory of the special idol that can defeat Rawhead? Never fleshed out. Why is he called Rawhead Rex when they establish that he existed before the Roman Empire, and hence the Irish use of Latin (rex is Latin for king) wouldn't have been utilized? Why does NO ONE at the Roman Catholic church know about the story of Rawhead and what lies in the altar, when most Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches out there openly claim to have the pinky finger of some saint from 2000 years ago? Never explained. At some points in this movie I imagined Clive Barker sitting next to me saying, Yeah, uh...just go with it for now. I've heard Barker and others have thought of remaking this film. I say go for it! It's a cool story, and there's a lot of potential that could probably be realized in a refined second take.
