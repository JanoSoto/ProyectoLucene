[{"date":"30 September 2007","score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) is private investigator, who is hired to discover if a snuff film is authentic or not. Welles is hired by a wealthy widow, whose well-known husband passed away recently. She has found a reel of S8-film in a safe. On the film is a cruel slaughtering of a young girl, who obviously does not pretend or act in this so called snuff film. Welles soon sinks deeper and deeper into world of people who are making these kind of movies.Here in Croatia there are lots of movies on TV at Saturday night. When you decide to stay at home on Saturday night you just want to watch one good movie. That Saturday on TV there where movies like Unforgiven, Fallen, The 6th Day, Seabiscuit and lots more. But I decided to watch 8MM. I didn't read what is this movie about, I just sat there and prepared myself to watch just another thriller. To tell you the truth, I was blown off with it. Blown off by everything considering this movie. Let me tell you why.Without good script there cannot be a good movie. This script was written by Andrew Kevin Walker, writer of Se7en and Sleepy Hollow, two brilliant movies. And in my books this is his third brilliant script. It's just unbelievable that there are persons who hire other people to make snuff film. How sick you must be to watch this? On that question the whole movie is based. Cage is a man with family (wife and young kid). So one average man is entering in this world. It's brilliant how Schumacher showed us the character of Tom Welles. Welles never imagined that he'll get that deep and that close to truth. When he first saw this snuff film he was disgusted but he wanted to find that girl who was on the movie. He wanted to know the truth, just like that old lady, just like the mother of Mary Ann, just like all of us.My favorite scene is when Cage asks the mother of the girl on the snuff film if she wants the truth no matter what and then again when he asks her if he can hurt the man who is guilty (Eddie Poole). There are so many emotions in character of Janet Mathews (Amy Morton is excellent) and in acting of Nicolas Cage. And here is the brilliance of this movie. By killing a killer you become one too. And that's what is all about. You become one of them, you are putting yourself on their level. When Cage comes back home and sees his baby-girl, he just cries. Cause sometimes all you can do is cry. But all the tears of this world won't bring murdered people back too life (connection with Se7en).Cage did his job brilliant, but the real score of this movie are supporting actors. Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini and Peter Stormare. Phoenix especially shines in his role and Gandolfini and Stormare (Fargo) are excellent choice as bad guys. All actors presented the world of pornography. The ultimate massage to all of us is that this people exist and these crimes are here. Deep in the underworld? Yes, maybe, but we just can't forget that these things are happening on this world, maybe in our country, our neighborhood, very close to us. I just want to say that this is one of the most underrated movies on IMDb and for those people who say that this is one of the worst movies ever made, I advice you just to look deeper at this movie or go ahead and pick some easier movies other time you sit in your sofa, at your perfect world.

This is the start of a suspenseful psychological thriller that sucked me in and did not let go until the credits rolled.The acting by all the lead and supporting characters is more than adequate. Kevin Bacon is right at home in his role of a somewhat bitter individual who undergoes heavy changes throughout the film. He does a great job, as do the other actors. The film is shot in a sober and down-to-earth way, giving it a serious tone. Plot wise, the movie is also more than decent, with only a few small plot holes which will only bother the most scrutinous of viewers.The movie's plot does however remind some viewers of other thrillers, mainly The Shining and The Sixth Sense (another 1999 release which overshadowed Stir of Echoes with a larger marketing campaign and larger overall budget). Some aspects of the story are indeed less than original, but the movie as a whole feels different and is very enjoyable.Overall, the movie falls just short of greatness in its genre. I found the quality and depth of the story to be good, but not quite as good as some of the afore mentioned greats in the thriller\/horror genres. even still, I recommend this film to every fan of thrillers and suspense.

However, when he accidentally meets the girl of his dreams and becomes embroiled in terrorist subversion, he is forced to re-evaluate his morality, his position and how to do the right thing.Brazil is simply brilliant, on every level. It scores as a futuristic sci-fi adventure, a star-crossed love story, a nightmarish fantasy, a hilarious satire on consumerism and vacuous apathy, a dazzling piece of visual cinema and especially as a vicious attack on controlling manipulative governments and their insane bureaucracies. It owes more than a little to George Orwell's 1984, but whilst it has all the political power of that great book it's also packed full of wonderful humour, exciting action, loopy characters and dynamic scenes. I think it's my favourite British film of all time (even if the director is from Minneapolis). The imagery alone is simply incredible; a cold, imperious, granite world with no relief from the grey, covered in piping and steel, retro-future technology with tiny screens and nineteen-forties minimalist electrics, wall-to-wall propaganda posters and endless vistas. One of my favourite scenes is where Tuttle\/DeNiro meets his sticky end - a man literally drowning in paperwork - an image which is absurd, horrifying, incredible and electrifying all at the same time. The whole movie is like that. The large cast are sensational, with Pryce particularly strong as the hapless, morally-stricken Sam, trying desperately to turn his life into something decent and keep his sanity. DeNiro is a wonder in a completely unfathomable small role who may in fact be only a fantasy in the hero's mind, Helmond and Hoskins are hilarious, Holm is beautifully paranoid and pathetic, and Palin is superb as the superficially pleasant but hideously nasty Jack Lint. The script, by Gilliam, noted playwright Tom Stoppard (Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead) and McKeown (who plays the slimy Lime) is nothing short of genius. The photography, by Roger Pratt, is even better; his amazing landscapes, wild colours and fast-moving shots leave you breathless and slack-jawed; the rapid pull-back on Sam's face in the torture-chamber near the end is simply one of the best shots ever filmed. There is also a wonderful, dreamy, hair-raising score by Michael Kamen which runs the gamut from symphonic hammerings to ear-chewing musak to thirties musical. No review of this outstanding movie would be complete without noting its criminal release in North America in a version first delayed then butchered then pulled by the artistically-challenged president of Universal Pictures; sadly this happens to a lot of good films (The Magnificent Ambersons, The Red Badge Of Courage, The Naked City, most of Sam Peckinpah's work, many others) but don't let it put you off. This movie is a powerful, mindbending, stupendous, one-of-a-kind adventure with a frighteningly comically accurate vision of the future which is growing dangerously closer all the time. The best film by a great mad director.
