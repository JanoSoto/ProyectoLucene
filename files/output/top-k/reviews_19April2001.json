This is my description of Evil Dead 2, you will probably want to ask why the sequel to a crappy 1982 gore-fest is the Greatest Film Ever, but I'll get on to that later.The film starts with a re-run of the first Evil Dead, only it has been re-shot. In this new version, only Ash(Bruce Cambell) and Linda go to the cabin, not five of them as there originally was. This pretty much renders the first film obsolete, but it should clarify that this is not a re-make, but a sequel. After this 'mini-Evil Dead' Ash is thrown through the woods on an unseen revolving crucifix. Then the film really starts.Ash is alone in the cabin, where he slowly becomes insane, and his hand becomes possessed (Give me back my hand!) It is at this point in the movie that the audience should realise that this is not a straight horror film. It is a comedy-horror. When Ash's hand is possessed we see the best pysical comedy ever seen! Easily beatng Jim Carrey beating himself up in Me, Myself & Irene. Then some people come to the cabin and the film shifts into blood-soaked high gear, and we are taken on a rip-roaring rollercoaster of a ride, ending up in the best set-up for a sequel ever!Now, you are probably still wondering why I have called it the Greatest Movie Ever. It is because no other film has combined so many genres and made it work. It has Horror. It has comedy. It has action. It has a bit set in Medival times.

Bridget (Zellweger) begins with some New Year's resolutions that include no more drinking or smoking, not being paranoid about her weight, and developing poise.  And-- last, but not least-- to avoid any romantic attachments to alcoholics, workaholics, peeping Toms or perverts.  Of course she promptly falls for the one man she knows who embodies all of those characteristics  Her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).  In the meantime, her mother, Pam (Gemma Jones), continues to play matchmaker for her daughter.  At a holiday gathering of friends and family, Pam nudges her in the direction of an old childhood chum, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), now a respectable attorney, and recently divorced.  Their initial meeting, however, proves to be a less than monumental event, further complicated by the fact that Cleaver was Darcy's Best Man at his wedding, and has some tales-out-of-school to tell about the subsequently ill fated marriage that puts Darcy in a rather bad light.  But Bridget could care less; she thinks Darcy is rude and a bore, and anyway, Daniel is her guy.  Work is good, her life is going well and-- as she is about to wake up and realize-- she hasn't kept a single one of her resolutions.  And, oh! she should have.\tFirst time director Maguire proves with this auspicious debut that she certainly knows her territory and how to negotiate it.  She has the touch and the eye for detail of a seasoned professional, and her sense of timing is impeccable.  She successfully avoids a major pitfall that do in many rookie directors right out of the chute, by never fishing for the cheap, forced, disdainfully pretentious or concocted laugh.  Everything in this film, especially the humor, flows freely and naturally from the circumstances of the characters and the story, which makes it all real and believable and allows it to be readily embraced by the audience.  This is a funny, often hilarious movie, but it's also very warm and at times poignant, and for handling it so sensibly, and with such sensitivity, Maguire deserves to be granted even more kudos.  It's quite simply an exceptionally well made film, presented with a style and grace that reflects that of the director herself.\tOf course, having a superlative leading lady was certainly not disadvantageous to Maguire's efforts, either, and Renee Zellweger has never been better than she is here as Bridget.  With her quirky good looks, personality and charisma, she is endearing, and she invades Meryl Streep territory by affecting a perfect British accent.  Whether she's lip-syncing to a Celine Dion song, doing karaoke at an office party after having a bit too much to drink, or battling with a blender, it's easy to believe that someone would like her just the way she is.  Even with her hair mussed, or in a somewhat disheveled state, she's alluring, and it all has to do with who she is deep down inside; Zellweger makes it clear that this is a woman of substance, and it's easy to like her.  There's a down-to-earth honesty and accessibility about her that makes her appealing, and she's someone to whom many in the audience are easily going to be able to relate.  For her portrayal of Betty in `Nurse Betty,' Zellweger received a Golden Globe; `Bridget' should land her smack in the middle of Oscar territory.\tAs Bridget's smarmy boss, Daniel, Hugh Grant turns in a noteworthy performance, putting a rather tarnished sheen on his natural charm that works so well for this character.  It's a nice departure from his usual bumbling, reserved Mr. Nice Guy routine he perfected in such films as `Notting Hill,' and `Four Weddings and A Funeral.'  With this role he challenges Greg Kinnear's part in `Someone Like You' for the top spot in the Boss-You-Should-Never-Date category.  And Firth does a memorable turn as Darcy, fairly reprising his role of the same name in the PBS miniseries, `Pride and Prejudice,' from which this story is loosely derived.  Initially appearing a bit sullen, he gets the chance to develop his character as the story unfolds, and he does it quite nicely, ultimately revealing Darcy's true nature.\tIn a supporting role, Gemma Jones gives a performance that deserves mention, doing a good job of fleshing out Bridget's mother in the brief time she is allotted.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Crispin Bonham-Carter (Greg), Jim Broadbent (Colin Jones), James Callis (Tom), Sally Phillips (Shazzer), Honor Blackman (Penny), Embeth Davidtz (Natasha), Shirley Henderson (Jude) and Celia Imrie (Una).  A warmly humorous, uplifting film, `Bridget Jones's Diary' is a delightful and satisfying experience with more than a touch of magic in it.  Not only is it an entertaining showcase for Zellweger's many talents, but heralds the arrival of a director from whom we can expect great things in the future, Sharon Maguire.  A well crafted, reality based comedy\/drama that is enjoyable and refreshingly devoid of inane nonsense or gross jokes is a rare find these days, and this is one of the best to hit the screen in a long, long time.  It's a film to be heartily embraced, and one I guarantee you'll want to see more than once.

I don't know who accused Stiles of being over-emotional, but I for one thought that her emotional outpour after watching the ballet was poorly acted.  Thomas was fortunate enough to go the entire film without having to act a scene beyond your stereotypical Intelligent, Forward-Thinking, Get-out-of-the-Ghetto Black Teen, and so had no such opportunity to display poor acting.The plot is standard.  It doesn't reveal any depth, it doesn't address race issues in any new ways - but why should it? The film is selling itself as a teen dance movie; the message of tolerance is a bonus that unfortunately still needs to be communicated to millions, so we shouldn't criticise the film for putting it in, even as an afterthought.This film is _not_ the best movie I've ever seen, and I only hope that people who've said that do so because they haven't seen many movies.

Unfortunately, it seems from the rash of trailers that Stiles is in, she's fallen into the trap of believing any part is a good part at this point in her career.

But first, of course, I read everyone else's comments.As far as I can see, most everyone has got it half right.The dance scenes are beautiful, and according to interview, Stiles did them all except for the pointe sections.The soundtrack is mainstream.  There's a couple of wicked tracks on there, but - no - it's not dead original and there's nothing we haven't heard before.The acting is standard.  The characters are stereotypes, and both the leads obviously knew this far enough in advance to fax their acting in, and make plans to do something better with the day.  I don't know who accused Stiles of being over-emotional, but I for one thought that her emotional outpour after watching the ballet was poorly acted.  Thomas was fortunate enough to go the entire film without having to act a scene beyond your stereotypical Intelligent, Forward-Thinking, Get-out-of-the-Ghetto Black Teen, and so had no such opportunity to display poor acting.The plot is standard.  It doesn't reveal any depth, it doesn't address race issues in any new ways - but why should it? The film is selling itself as a teen dance movie; the message of tolerance is a bonus that unfortunately still needs to be communicated to millions, so we shouldn't criticise the film for putting it in, even as an afterthought.This film is _not_ the best movie I've ever seen, and I only hope that people who've said that do so because they haven't seen many movies.  But equally, it isn't a complete waste of money.  I'm a big advocate of seeing a movie for what it is - entertainment.  Save the Last Dance sells itself on the dance scenes and on the young, attractive and talented people in it.  They may not get a chance to show their talent, but they go through the motions, piecing together the dance sequences with a plot we've all heard before.Plenty of people have noted that this film shows how Stiles is en route to stardom. I disagree.  Having seen Ten Things..., I desperately wanted to see more of her, and this was one of the reasons I saw Last Dance.  Unfortunately, it seems from the rash of trailers that Stiles is in, she's fallen into the trap of believing any part is a good part at this point in her career.  Let's just hope that career lasts long enough to shadow the less laudable roles she's taking at the moment.In Summary don't expect too much.  The film addresses familiar issues in a mildly different context to normal, has a catchy soundtrack, and some truly enjoyable dance scenes choreographic influences ranging from Bourne to Breakbeat - has to be impressive. Just go see the film expecting a Teen Dance flick, and you'll enjoy it.

Some thought it was simply overrated; others thought it was just plain bad. And that troubles me.  I cannot fathom how a film of such emotional power and energy can be considered mediocre in the eyes of the normal viewer.  I'm not going to call those normal viewers idiots--to be fair--but I will say that they definitely have to give this great film another look.  And if they still don't get it, give it another look--and so on and so on and so on.  Because I believe this CANNOT be regarded as a bad film; it can only be misunderstood.  Maybe it's because the messages and morals are delivered in a subtle manner.  People, in general, look at films in such a superficial manner.  What they see is a middle-aged loser smoking pot and his crackpot wife who has motives to murder him.  Just like the tagline says...you just have to LOOK CLOSER.Performance-wise alone, I would regard American Beauty superior to any other film ever made.  Kevin Spacey--who I usually love in whatever he does--gives the greatest performance of his career.  I guess most viewers didn't think of it that way, because Spacey played a HUMAN BEING, and not these one-dimensional twits we're used to seeing on screen.  Lester Burnham (Spacey's character) is neither a sinner, nor a saint.  He has his faults, but who the hell doesn't?  He's a stuck-up, white-collar suburban who hasn't done anything to take advantage of his life.  He's been jerked around by his bosses and his demanding wife.  In the masturbation scene--which people so rudely took out of context in a scatological manner--Lester explains that his time in the shower is the most exciting point of his day, and it all goes downhill from there.  He explains, in his vivid narration, that his life is completely pointless and masturbation is the only activity that even closely rebels him from society.  You start to really feel how pathetic this man is.  And I liked the scene where we're introduced to Jane (the daughter).  Lester narrates that he can reveal to her that all that teenage angst that experiences on a daily basis will all come to an end, but he doesn't want to lie to her.  That's how brutally honest this film proves to be!  You would never hear a line like that in any other movie.  American Beauty really really tells it like it is.A movie like this has no genre.  It's a dead-on character study about reality.  Reality has no genre.  People basically classify this as a drama, but it has other elements mixed in.  I liked the comic elements, some of which are funnier than I've seen in most straight comedies.  For example, the scene at the drive-thru.  Lester catches Carolyn (his wife) smooching with the Real Estate King Buddy, who she has been cheating with behind his back.  Of course, she wasn't aware that he just got a job at Mr. Smiley's.  He appears at the drive-thru window with a happy-go-lucky grin, saying Welcome to Mr. Smiley's.  There's none of that predictable quarrel you would expect in a scene like this.  Instead, Lester firmly tells his wife not to bother him about his faults, since she has faults of her own.  Then he shifts back into happy-go-lucky mode and says Would you like Smiley sauce with that?  I think the way they handled that scene was what made it so special.  That's what makes the whole movie special.  It rebels against all cliches, all stereotypes, all predictability.  I also have to give a hand to Mena Suvari, who plays the ditsy cheerleader Angela who Lester lusts after.  She gives us the ditsy characteristics, but never overplays it.  Let's face it, there are ditsy girls like her in the world who think they are better than everyone else.  I'm sure all the females reading this are nodding their heads right now.  So I didn't think she in any way fell into the ditsy blonde stereotype.  And I liked the little surprise at the end, when Lester comes face-to-face with her late at night.  American Beauty is a film that works on both levels, the entertainment level AND the artistic level.  This isn't one of those ultra-artsy pieces that you only expect major critics to go in for.  This is an entertaining film that is artistic in the way it studies everyday life.  The whole film has a universal message.  Though your family may not DIRECTLY relate to the Burnhams there is some moral that you should get after seeing their behaviors.  Their behaviors are so true to life it's frightening.  Alan Ball and Sam Mendes could've went through the standard route and portrayed each character as the standard stuck-up, morally correct suburbanites out of a Leave it to Beaver episode.  Guess what?  That's not how it's like.  The Burnhams are middle-class citizens, but does that mean they do everything right?  I think the dinner table conversations do a great job at mirroring how a family of this kind would really act.  And Sam Mendes does a terrific job at directing the scene by displaying a wide shot of the family in the dining room, while boring elevator music plays in the background, perfectly expressing the mood.  Then we slow zoom on the family as the conversation progresses, again expressing the mood perfectly.  And watch how frank Lester's dialogue is.  In the scene after he quits his job, he tells his wife and daughter  Today I told my boss to go f**k himself.  Pass the asparagus.  He just blurts it out so casually.  And he does that throughout the whole movie.  I'm sure any dysfunctional family can relate to Lester's actions and will probably get scared after seeing how real it looks.By the end of the movie, everything pieces together perfectly.  This is a film that ACTUALLY makes you think, and makes you think hard.  And if you're with someone, you can spark long conversations about the major themes.  If you look at this movie on the surface, it's hard to regard it as a masterpiece.  I'm sure many think I'm exaggerating when saying this is the best movie OF ALL TIME, but I really think so.  No other film has had this much power over me.  There's lots of stimulating visuals, yet this is no Star Wars.  There's no spaceships crash-landing on Earth, no aliens exploding.  But do really need such massive special f\/x to make a great film?  No, we don't.  And American Beauty proves that point.  This film had the biggest impact on me with its sheer emotional power--which was delilvered through brillaintly original, honest, unpretentious writing, powerful directing and unforgettable performances.  P.S.  I also give credit to Wes Bentley, a terrific young actor who I desperately hope to see in many more movies.  He adds great substance to his acting, and he has those deep, dark eyes that he uses to express emotion without even saying a word of dialogue.  He's a great talent, in all aspects.  Also, Chris Cooper--a very underrated actor--is terrific as usual. I think both him and Wes deserved supporting Oscars.

'Braveheart', arguably, is one of the best period dramas ever made, and definitely one of the best cast, written, and choreographed films. The music is quite stirring, and the cinematography comes close to capturing the vast beauty of the locales. All in all, for me, this film is a 10 out of 10.

With little substance behind the intended shock, the film is left with little else to entertain the audience.  It's kind of like watching Guess Who's Coming To Dinner? or even Basic Instinct today -- at the time those films were released, they pushed a lot of emotional buttons, but now the issues and topics they dealt with seems rather tame.The film deals with the relationship between Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife, Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman), a wealthy, happily married couple with a small, lovely daughter (Madison Eginton).  However, in an awkward moment Alice confesses to William that she considered cheating on him early on in their marriage.  She never actually acting on her adulterous thoughts, but William becomes so enraged that he goes out alone into the night, contemplating the future of his marriage and looking for a random sexual encounter with which he can gain a certain amount of revenge.And that's it.  There's a lot of scenes (some imagined, some real) of kinky sexual encounters, but nothing incredibly over the top, nothing that hasn't been seen in mainstream films before.  William's reaction to his wife's confession seems entirely too strong.  No, I don't think that any man ever wants to hear from his wife that she thought about having an affair with somebody else, but to react as strongly as he did seemed slightly odd.  If she'd actually had the affair, it might've made more sense.  Scenes that could've been built into dark, brooding, tormented sequences of William agonizing over what to do often seem pointless because of this . . . and over two hours' worth of them is mind-numbingly boring overkill.There's still a few highlights -- Cruise puts in a solid performance, considering the material he has to work with, and Kidman actually shines in what really is a supporting role as Alice.  Also, the mood, the camera angles, the odd lighting -- in terms of technique, the film ranks as one of Kubrick's finest efforts.  Considering all the hype that went along with this film, though, it's very disappointing, and even on its own merits, it's average at best.

No, I don't think that any man ever wants to hear from his wife that she thought about having an affair with somebody else, but to react as strongly as he did seemed slightly odd.  If she'd actually had the affair, it might've made more sense.  Scenes that could've been built into dark, brooding, tormented sequences of William agonizing over what to do often seem pointless because of this . . . and over two hours' worth of them is mind-numbingly boring overkill.There's still a few highlights -- Cruise puts in a solid performance, considering the material he has to work with, and Kidman actually shines in what really is a supporting role as Alice.  Also, the mood, the camera angles, the odd lighting -- in terms of technique, the film ranks as one of Kubrick's finest efforts.  Considering all the hype that went along with this film, though, it's very disappointing, and even on its own merits, it's average at best.

While artistically and visually brilliant, Eyes Wide Shut suffers from relying on a script that would've been considered daring and shocking in years gone by, but for 1999 and beyond it offers nothing particularly outrageous.  With little substance behind the intended shock, the film is left with little else to entertain the audience.  It's kind of like watching Guess Who's Coming To Dinner? or even Basic Instinct today -- at the time those films were released, they pushed a lot of emotional buttons, but now the issues and topics they dealt with seems rather tame.The film deals with the relationship between Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife, Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman), a wealthy, happily married couple with a small, lovely daughter (Madison Eginton).  However, in an awkward moment Alice confesses to William that she considered cheating on him early on in their marriage.  She never actually acting on her adulterous thoughts, but William becomes so enraged that he goes out alone into the night, contemplating the future of his marriage and looking for a random sexual encounter with which he can gain a certain amount of revenge.And that's it.

He is played marvelously by 14-yr-old Jamie Bell who was discovered for this film by auditioning 2000+ boys who 1)could dance, 2)could act, 3)was the right age, and 4)who had the correct NE English accent.  Bell is so good, with the great and sincere smile or the brooding, angry face, depending on the demands of the scene. He may become a one-hit wonder, but in this film he is nothing short of award quality. No question, even though the movie is filled with fine, experienced British actors, Jamie Bell carries this film, and that is remarkable for a first-timer!CAUTION -- FOLLOWING MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER OR TWO --The story is set in 1984, in the coal-mining (the pits) area of northeast England. Workers are on strike and Margaret Thatcher is bound to break them, which she eventually does. Billy's mother has recently died, and he now shares a flat with his caring but overtly tough father, his older brother, and his half-demented grandmother. Times are tough, no one is working in this coal-mining community, angry picketers curse and throw things at the buses of scabs crossing the line.Billy is in boxing training, but in the ring, wearing his grandfather's old gloves, begins to dance around, seems that dancing is just in his blood. Much later in the movie he explains, at the end of an audition, I just feel like electricity when I am dancing. I become someone else. One punch decks him in this bout.Billy quite accidently becomes aware of the ballet class at the other end of the floor (British pronounce ballet as if it were spelled 'bally'), gets interested, and is encouraged by the older lady instructor. She quickly recognizes Billy's talent and encourages him to continue.Two problems -- there is no extra money around for 'bally' lessons and 2) his dad is horrified at the thought that his son might become a 'bally dancer', also afraid that he might become a homosexual. Their men box, play football, etc, but dance?? No way. So Billy has to practice his dance positions secretly, and sneak out to dance practice, his dad thinking he is still boxing. Until the boxing guy says he hasn't seen Billy in weeks!So dad shows up at 'bally' practice and spots Billy among the girls, and you can see him fuming, his face turning red, and pulls Billy out. But Billy keeps on, on his own.  On another occasion dad catches him in the dance studio again. This time Billy stands 6 inches (15 cm) from his dad, almost nose-to-nose, defiant face, and begins to dance. All over the room, all kinds of moves, tap, modern, 'bally' -- and stops in front of dad, who then realizes both how much his son loves 'bally' and how much talent he has.Eventually Billy gets an audition in London, where dad had never even been, gets accepted, strike ends, dad is determined to see that his son gets the schooling he deserves.  Before Billy leaves, he and dad are talking, warmly, and Billy asks, If I change my mind I can come home, can't I? Dad answers, But I've already 'let out' your room. They both laugh.The movie ends 13 years later, Billy is 25, and his dad goes to London to see him dance as the featured performer. All we get is a quick shot of him being told his dad is there, then leaping on stage. If I were a 'bally' fan I could tell from the costume which 'bally' it was, but I am not.Fine story, important time historically, families in crisis and Billy Elliot determined to pursue his dream. There is a fair amount of 'salty' language, from all characters, but it always seems to be in context with the film and how NE Englanders really spoke in 1984. I was not offended by it, but I suspect some viewers might be.I hope to see this one again some day. I rate it a strong 8 of 10 and think most everyone would enjoy it. The DVD has a few extras, the most interesting being the making of with interviews of the various actors and director. The sound is DD 5.1 and mostly good.  However, the quiet dialog and British accent forced me to rewind and re-listen to some to understand them. I also had to increase the volume 6dB which is quite a lot (4X sound level) compared to most other DVDs. So I give the sound only a C- overall.  Still, this can be overcome and not a fatal flaw in an otherwise superb presentation.
