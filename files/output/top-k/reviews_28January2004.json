[{"date":"28 January 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Will Patton, and Ving Rhames star in one of the best movies I've seen all year. Sean Connery is Robert MacDougal a jewel thief; Catherine Zeta-Jones is Virginia Gin Baker, an insurance investigator sent to capture him. As the movie evolves, it becomes apparent that not everything is what it seems. Entrapment is a movie that people will enjoy as it will keep them on the edge of their seats and keep them guessing whether or not certain characters are on the level. The plot includes trying to capture Robert MacDougal while he tries his hand at a theft of mask. The movie doesn't end there, not only does it have one robbery but there a two; the second is an offer by a mystery person who can only be revealed when it is seen.Entrapment kept me guessing throughout to who might be on the level, wondering who might be the real thief. Along with the suspense, Entrapment includes underlying but clear sexual tension and incredible chemistry between Connery and Zeta-Jones.Also, Entrapment was enjoyable due to the many high-tech gadgets, which were used by Connery and Zeta-Jones. One scene in particular was very enjoyable as it involved Zeta-Jones in sensual positions. It seems like Connery's character was a father figure for Zeta-Jones and was proven in several scenes throughout the film. Entrapment also includes great support from its co-stars Will Patton and Ving Rhames. Patton and Rhames are so good it is difficult to tell whether or not they are part of a conspiracy to steal the mask or they are really tracking Connery and Zeta-Jones. Entrapment is a movie for people who like a good suspenseful thriller that will make you think and does not have a resolution until the end. Furthermore, it contains a surprise ending that will the audience will enjoy. Entrapment works for me because it shows me Sean Connery at his best and Catherine Zeta-Jones as a star on the rise. Entrapment deserves to be seen.

But it's the quality of those bits that make it good.  Ian Holm is a Napoleon sensitive about his height.  John Cleese is a terrible polite Robin Hood.  Sean Connery is a straightforwardly heroic Agamemnon.  Peter Vaughan is a disgusting ogre.  The whole thing makes an absolute mockery of any kind of theology and is miles better than the director's later Adventures Of Baron Munchausen, which has a similar structure, and which I also like.  And it's full of dwarves fighting the embodiment of Ultimate Evil, who is the film's real secret weapon.  Dark in parts, downright absurd in others, this is a film you just can't take seriously.

I wanted to buy this movie so bad that I looked everywhere for it and did not stop until I found it. It is a different type of film for Robert DeNiro though, he doesn't normally do action films but he did a really good job in this one. Jean Reno as always plays a really good action star in this movie for his role as Vincent. All of the actors in this film played really good roles, Sean Bean as Spence, Natascha McElhone as Deidre and the best villain was Jonathan Pryce as Seamus O'Rourke. If you are looking for lots of action and great car chases, I strongly recommend this movie, I give it 10 out of 10.
