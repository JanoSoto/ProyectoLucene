Not really meant to be a scary feature, but Gedde Wantanabe, as the nerdy college friend who doesn't take much to get drunk, adds the much needed humor to pull away from too much mediocrity. Without the much scare, of course, you would definitely need something to hold your attention, if of course you weren't tempted to see it in the first place because of the familiar 80s faces (including Dedee Pfeiffer).

Yet I think this is something close to a minor masterpiece. This is quite rich material -- very literary, in a way -- and the invoking of Catholicism (and, for me, Genet) through the title is apt, for the way it delves into accepted perversions. At first I was wondering what the much-discussed shocking aspect of the film was, thinking perhaps it was the (would-be) sensuousness of this Latin boy-lover (the shared drink is not something you'd get in common fare), but it seems like it's more the violence that people react (or object) to. While it didn't upset me, I think the violence is interesting in two ways one, the digital video makes the dispassionate killings have little impact, because it makes the film seem somewhat amateurish (with aid of the acting), like a genre film made on a shoestring budget; and two, the film as a whole is anti-dramatic -- for instance, when the revelation occurs, in a dramatized film it would be devastating the truth of your lover revealed, and the swirl of emotions it creates; here, nothing -- so there is no cathartic violence (as in The Godfather, for example), and it isn't lush. But it isn't brutal, either -- you don't get your nose rubbed in it, and I cherished that generosity to the audience.The digital also helps keep the film grounded -- the only really attention-grabbing aspects of the film, as cinema, are the opening and closing framing of very beautiful music, and one nice over-the-wall camera move. It's like a cleverer Man Bites Dog, in the sense that this *doesn't* draw attention to itself, that there is no winking or overt displays of cleverness. The film as a whole is subtle (at one point it feels like magic realism, even though we are told, I guess, that it's not), even though individual scenes are not (that the euthanizing of the dog is the only killing that has feeling is very heavy-handed). It's also incredibly easy to watch, and I think that must be due in part because the digital -- clear, crisp, and clean, with a smooth lucidity -- helps you seep into the film quicker, without any fuss.

As this is my first taste of Jim Jarmusch, I had no idea of what to expect, but even if I had; I reckon that this film wouldn't have conformed to them. Dead Man is a surreal and trippy western that peels itself away from the staples of the genre and succeeds in creating something truly one-off and self-styled. Lead by a score written by Neil Young, Dead Man is continually satisfying and powerful; and you get the impression that every scene has been fully thought through, and is perfectly realised as the auteur intended. For this reason, Dead Man captivates it's viewer from the moment it starts until the moment it ends, and as it descends into full blown trippy weirdness, you can do nothing but stare in admiration of this strange gem of cult cinema. The plot is thin on the ground and it largely lacks meaning, but it doesn't matter because Dead Man is a purely aesthetic experience. Still, it follows William Blake (Johnny Depp), an accountant from Cleveland that arrives in a town to take a job offer, only to find that the vacancy has already been filled&#133; Dead Man is filmed in very stark black and white, which only adds to the surrealism of the story. Had this film have been done in colour, it would not have captured the same atmosphere that the black and white gives it; and so this decision was an inspired one indeed. One staple of the western genre that Jarmusch is keen to retain is the use of close-ups. The director spends a lot of time caressing Depp's facial features with his camera and, at times, even focuses on his lead actor when the action doesn't concern him. Aside from keeping in with the western tradition, this also allows Jarmusch to keep the focus on the main character, which keeps the viewer focused on his plight. For this film, Jarmusch has put together a cast of B-movie icons that will have B-movie fans foaming at the mouth. Crispin Glover, Robert Mitchum, Billy Bob Thornton, Lance Henriksen, Gabriel Byrne, John Hurt, Alfred Molina and even Iggy Pop feature and it's great to see so many faces in the same movie. The cast is, of course, lead by a man who is perhaps today's best actor; Johnny Depp. Depp's name on a credit list speaks for itself, and I don't need to tell you that his performance is great; nor do I need to point out the effortless cool that this movie exudes, largely thanks to the great man's presence. My only advice is see it...see it now. ","genre":null},{"date":"10 March 2005","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Dead Man is a unique piece of film.

The camp is used to conduct medical research that is to aid the SS during WW2. Women prisoners are injected with viruses, tortured with electroshock and whipped to test their tolerance for pain. Ilsa also conducts private research, more or less for pleasure purposes.Some of the violence is a little graphic. We see a fair bit of blood, and in one instance, they are performing surgery on a prisoner's vagina. Maggots are injected with a virus and allowed to eat away at a prisoner's flesh. One of the female prisoners is left a bloody mess after 3 days of torture. In others it is left to your imagination, such as the castration of a male prisoner and the use of an electrified dildo on the female inmates.

In others it is left to your imagination, such as the castration of a male prisoner and the use of an electrified dildo on the female inmates. During a dinner scene, another female prisoner is hanging from a noose and bound at the hands and feet with only a block of ice supporting her.As for nudity, there is also plenty of that. The prisoners are routinely shown without clothes, and the lovely Miss Thorne also has a fair share of topless shots.Having said all that, I still felt that it was not quite as shocking as I had anticipated. Not that it is ever pleasant to see people being tortured and raped. With the reputation this film had I guess I expected it to be much worse.It's a sad statement on today's society when one reacts so calmly to such a movie. To me, I think some of the shock value may have come from the setting and the storyline. A Nazi prison camp, set during WW2. That certainly does bring up all sorts of disturbing and horrifying images.All in all, while a little less shocking than I was planning for, this was a pretty good film. Anchor Bay did a wonderful job restoring the movie, and put together a nice package along with Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks and The Wicked Warden.Also check out the audio commentary with Thorne, director Don Edmunds and producer David Freidman. Despite the flack that this movie has received, none of the principal people involved seem to have any regrets. (Despite this, Freidman, along with a lot of the other actors used pseudonyms. Freidman claimed it was as a result of a dispute with the Canadian financiers. Thorne is on record as saying the she has indeed suffered a little career-wise after using her real name on the Ilsa films).Rating 8 out of 10 ","genre":"Horror, War"},{"date":"10 March 2005","score":"5 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" I was eager to see this film because I am a huge fan of Malcolm McDowell(even though I have seen very little of his work) and I saw some positive reviews on his performance.

I then saw him in Cyborg 3 which was disappointing but his short appearance was legendary acting. Very recently I have seen Caligula and McDowells performance touched me.

Sure, he has had some other projects like the Dirty Harry-movies or for instance Absolute Power or True Crime, but never ever was he has good as when he played the not very talkative, rather mysterious and strange cowboy. In my opinion every actor has a genre that suits him best and for Clint Eastwood that definitely is the Western.This time he's William Munny, a former criminal who now lives somewhere on the prairie with his two little kids, where he grows some crops and raises pigs. His wife, who's already dead, was the one that brought him back to the right way of life and since then he hasn't done anything wrong again. Life is very hard, but than he gets an interesting offer from The Schofield Kid. A young prostitute was stabbed several times and now she has several awful looking scars in her face. Her colleagues have put a prize on the head of the two cowboys who did it. William Munny will try to kill the two cowboys with the help of The Schofield Kid and his long-time friend Ned Logan...Most Westerns don't take the time for some character development, but this one does and it has to be said, it's done excellently. What makes this movie so interesting and good is the fact that the characters in this movie aren't black and white at all. The line between good and evil, between heroism and villainy is very thin and is crossed several times in an excellent way. You always think you know the characters, but than they act completely different from what you think they will do.The story is a lot better than what you might expect from the average modern Western. Of course we aren't talking about Cowboys vs. Indians here, but it still could have been a rather thin story line (think for example of The Quick and the Dead, where we only get to see one duel after the other). Somehow they were able to keep the original features of the Western, but with a very interesting story added to it. I can only admire that and that's why I give it a well deserved 8.5\/10.

Based on an inaccurate history by Alexandre Dumas, everyone has a version and a character that they like the most.As a result of the story's success therefore, we are still receiving modern adaptations in the 21st century. In 2001, with martial arts stunts and a mediocre cast, this French\/American collaboration, entitled either The Musketeer or D'Artagnan depending on your country, is mostly dreadful, but with the saving grace that is Tim Roth.After witnessing the murder of his parents, young D'Artagnan (Justin Chambers) is raised by his old friend Planchet (Jean-Pierre Castaldi). Becoming the finest swordsman in France, D'Artagnan tries to follow in his fathers footsteps by becoming a King's Musketeer. Times are not good for these heroes though, with their leader Treville (Michael Byrne) imprisoned and the evil Febre (Tim Roth) out for blood.From the opening musical sequence The Musketeer smacks of awkwardness. With a script and a set up which would be more at home in the 1940s, it attempts to redeem itself with lavish fight scenes. It never really settles into a decent routine, mainly due to a script which feels like it was written by a child. With some lines so bad, it is too embarrassing to repeat, the script crashes and burns without a hint of reprieve.The fights as well, whilst incredibly clever to set up and film, never really feel like they belong. Reminiscent of traditionally Chinese films, these fights just don't feel realistic and they are often excessive. The final major battle involving an enormous fight and a small hero vs bad-guy encounter, is drawn out to it's excesses and is ridiculous to watch.Truth be told, this film would probably be up there amongst the worst films ever if it wasn't for the one wonderful aspect which is Tim Roth's appearance.Roth, looking like a homeless dog in desperate need of a grooming, is wonderful throughout. Not helped by the dire script, he casts a perpetually evil glance over the entire film. He struts around with a badly made eye-patch on, and he manages to pull the part off. He has one or two scenes of pure evil which he makes work, not because the script is remotely decent, but because he speaks his lines with a sense of maliciousness and smoothness. Roth gets a badly scripted character, he DOES overact, but he somehow manages to make it work. He is the one highlight in an otherwise dire film.For not the first time, and definitely not the last, a film with little going for it, is released. Loosely based on a work by one of France's greatest writers, The Musketeer is a woeful encounter which is only saved by an excellent performance by Tim Roth.

In 2001, with martial arts stunts and a mediocre cast, this French\/American collaboration, entitled either The Musketeer or D'Artagnan depending on your country, is mostly dreadful, but with the saving grace that is Tim Roth.After witnessing the murder of his parents, young D'Artagnan (Justin Chambers) is raised by his old friend Planchet (Jean-Pierre Castaldi). Becoming the finest swordsman in France, D'Artagnan tries to follow in his fathers footsteps by becoming a King's Musketeer. Times are not good for these heroes though, with their leader Treville (Michael Byrne) imprisoned and the evil Febre (Tim Roth) out for blood.From the opening musical sequence The Musketeer smacks of awkwardness. With a script and a set up which would be more at home in the 1940s, it attempts to redeem itself with lavish fight scenes. It never really settles into a decent routine, mainly due to a script which feels like it was written by a child. With some lines so bad, it is too embarrassing to repeat, the script crashes and burns without a hint of reprieve.The fights as well, whilst incredibly clever to set up and film, never really feel like they belong. Reminiscent of traditionally Chinese films, these fights just don't feel realistic and they are often excessive. The final major battle involving an enormous fight and a small hero vs bad-guy encounter, is drawn out to it's excesses and is ridiculous to watch.Truth be told, this film would probably be up there amongst the worst films ever if it wasn't for the one wonderful aspect which is Tim Roth's appearance.Roth, looking like a homeless dog in desperate need of a grooming, is wonderful throughout. Not helped by the dire script, he casts a perpetually evil glance over the entire film. He struts around with a badly made eye-patch on, and he manages to pull the part off. He has one or two scenes of pure evil which he makes work, not because the script is remotely decent, but because he speaks his lines with a sense of maliciousness and smoothness. Roth gets a badly scripted character, he DOES overact, but he somehow manages to make it work. He is the one highlight in an otherwise dire film.For not the first time, and definitely not the last, a film with little going for it, is released. Loosely based on a work by one of France's greatest writers, The Musketeer is a woeful encounter which is only saved by an excellent performance by Tim Roth. The film is worth watching ultimately for Roth, and Roth alone.

Hollywood in particular has thrived over the years with films dealing with this subject. Whether telling the story of an observer from a different time meddling with history, or simply telling a story where the change has already happened, Hollywood loves to do these what if stories.In 1980, a film was released called The Final Countdown. Considering the change in events if the attack on Pearl Harbour had been stopped, the film was cleverly made and with a solid cast and acting. Seeming perhaps slightly dated 20 years after it's release, The Final Countdown is still a solid film and well worth viewing.In the 1980s, the USS Nimitz, captained by Matthew Yelland (Kirk Douglas), is cruising 200 miles off Pearl Harbour. Suddenly a mysterious storm hits the ship and the crew are stunned to realise they are back in 1941. Now, with the Japanese air forces in their sights, Yelland, Commander Richard Owens (James Farentino) and civilian observer Warren Lasky (Martin Sheen) must decide whether to change history for the better.Legends in their own rights, Douglas and Sheen is certainly an interesting pairing. Made 20 years after Douglas's most famous film (Spartacus) and only one year after Sheen's (Apocalypse Now), The Final Countdown has brought together two actors who nearly always perform superbly. Working as two parts of a great trio (Farentino being the third), these two actors are brilliant as the hardened captain wanting to take events one stage at a time, and the civilian who feels out of his depth.The Final Countdown however is a good film not just due to it's actors, but because it is a well written story which ticks along nicely until it's predictable conclusion. There's no denying that it's eventual solution regarding the attack feels slightly rushed, whilst the one deeply philosophical scene is also cut short, but as a complete piece, it is entertaining enough, and well thought out enough, to keep the audience interested.As entertainment, The Final Countdown really shouldn't be criticised. Telling a well written story and containing some great acting, it has all the makings of a traditional Hollywood blockbuster. Slightly dated compared with modern films, it might not have the special effects which recent ones do, but it has enough action and story in it to make you want to watch it numerous times. Well worth watching on a quiet Sunday afternoon.

Each film separated by six years, Evil Dead, Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness (or Medieval Dead as some fans enjoy referring to it as) all certainly hold a certain low-budget fanbase appeal. None of them did very well financially, at least not in theaters (particularly the third, which had the largest budget and flopped on initial release), but the same can be said for Donnie Darko, the flop of 2001 that went on to do very well on video and has played continually at midnight showings across America, enticing new fans every day.Evil Dead II Dead by Dawn stars Bruce Campbell as the returning Ash, the hapless hero who visits a remote wilderness cabin with his girlfriend only to inadvertently unleash the Deadites from another world. After his girlfriend is possessed and murdered by one of the demons, Ash finds himself fending for his life in the cabin and enduring endless physical pain.This is a film set free of logic, cohesion, and reality. Ash murders his possessed girlfriend but never really seems to mourn his loss. Soon he's cutting off his own hand and doesn't really seem to miss it very much in the following scenes (he replaces it with a chainsaw &#150; a clever idea that nevertheless is totally and utterly ridiculous). If I cut off my hand, I might be sort of upset, but not Ash &#150; he doesn't really seem to mind, and it doesn't seem to hurt him very much, either, as he immediately wraps it in a bandage (which must have a magical effect, because blood never stains through the fabric). Furthermore, Ash never seems to fear death from blood loss, or the fact that when he returns to civilization, he might have a hard time convincing local authorities that he's not responsible for the murder of his girlfriend and the visitors who show up midway through the film and all proceed to quickly die painful deaths at the hands of the Deadites.No matter. That's not the point of this film. Evil Dead II is pure fun, and nothing more. With this in mind, its strong fanbase comes across as being rather intimidating &#150; visiting any Evil Dead message board will reveal some people who seem to thrive on this film, daily reciting quotes, acting out scenes, and dreaming up scenarios for the (pending) sequel Army of Darkness II. That begs the question Is Evil Dead II really deserving of its critical and public acclaim? Having been referenced by Jack Black in High Fidelity as the film you must see in order to stray away from devolving into a movie idiot, Evil Dead II is a fun experience with a charismatic, energetic lead performance and a clever and witty script. Before I saw EDII, Black's recommendation in High Fidelity (&#133;there's so much blood!) was a joke -- a parody of the macho male action, sex, nudity, loud music attitude. After having seen Evil Dead II I realize that Black was right -- the blood and guts really do make it worth seeing &#150; they almost become a punch line to the joke, such as when a body is dragged into a fruit cellar by a demon and a spew of excessive fake red water drenches the heroine as the corpse is churned into a million pieces.So, no, it's not a masterpiece and it probably isn't quite deserving of its strong reputation. It's that type of movie, where you kind of enjoy it for the cheese factor &#150; and don't try to heavily criticize its flaws, because to do that would be way too easy. And obvious.The film is more of a remake than a sequel, recapping the events of the first film, dropping three characters, and generally picking up somewhere in the middle. For example in the original Evil Dead Ash stumbles upon the Book of the Dead, and he does so again in this movie. Many events are totally re-filmed as if they never occurred. It's a rare beast of a sequel &#150; somewhere oddly in between continuation and smug self-parody.I personally prefer the original Evil Dead if only because I find the horror elements stronger and the comedy far less goofy (if there are even any traces of comedy in the original at all). Evil Dead II goes a bit too far sometimes &#150; the dancing furniture is lame, for example.However, no one can say this series lacks originality. Instead of presenting us with a banal representation of the original film, director Sam Raimi reunites with Campbell and creates a whole new beast &#150; packed with excessive physical humor (think ultra-violent Three Stooges on a macabre level), self-parody, tongue-in-cheek humor, and what Campbell himself described as splatstick comedy. On top of that, Campbell is much better here than he was in the original (where he seemed to be a pale shade and more cowardly version of the typical action hero persona) &#150; Ash is still somewhat of a coward but Campbell lends his character a great sense of irony here that if anything only establishes Ash as one of cinema's most iconic characters.Overall, Evil Dead II is a really fun ride, with a superior performance from Campbell.

On top of that, Campbell is much better here than he was in the original (where he seemed to be a pale shade and more cowardly version of the typical action hero persona) &#150; Ash is still somewhat of a coward but Campbell lends his character a great sense of irony here that if anything only establishes Ash as one of cinema's most iconic characters.Overall, Evil Dead II is a really fun ride, with a superior performance from Campbell. It may not be on the same level as the original in terms of horror or just general enjoyment, but it's still a blast. Groovy, baby!

In the summer of 2004, I was trying to make time to see the Nicole \/ Bette parody of the movie (YES, you read right - a PARODY) - missed it - I was an idiot for not taking two lousy hours to drive down to the cinema. But, anyway, I bought the 1975 version on DVD and was kind of disappointed in it at first, feeling it to be a bit slow moving (I AM an American, we like our stuff fast-paced and in-the-face) but I couldn't get it out of my mind and I kept going back and forth with SCENE SELECTION until, by God, it ended up as one of my favorite movies, ever. The creepy husband, I was highly amused to discover, is the creepy first doctor in The Exorcist (YOU KEEP DRUGS IN YOUR HOUSE?). Joanna seems sad, resigned, and with those huge, expressive eyes of hers, seems to always look outward, always out for something better. Then along came Paula. God, I love Paula Prentiss - why aren't she and Katharine acting more often today? Frank Oz, of the new one, wanted to film cameos with them, but decided against the idea - he didn't want to take away from the story.The storyline of the 1975 film can be seen from various angles - as a satire on the perfect marriage, and also, if you will, fundamentalist Christianity, the corporate workplace, school, you name it, every aspect of life demands a form of submission and conformity or else there will be negative consequences. You're suspended and subsequently fired for dressing a certain way and for being too outgoing, etc. You're beaten by teachers in school, you're ridiculed and otherwise ostracized by peers in school, and, for that matter, some co-workers. When Joanna sees Bobbie changed and just cannot get through to her at all, it reminded me of several times in life when I saw a friend had taken on a major change - marriage in the burbs, religious conversion, etc. Hell, I even took EST and there was the occasional person I could relate to, my own Bobbie - then they CHANGED and I just wanted to run out of the room, screaming.Oh, yeah, this film is the perfect illustration of that horrific aspect of life. So much for live and let live.As for the 2004 version, after the dark cinematography and the chilling easy listening music, it was great to take a breath, kick back and just laugh at it all, with the orchestral bombast, teletubbies gone berserk and ominous hellish choirs. That's another aspect of life - to be stirred, scared, disturbed by something in 1975, and to laugh in its face as a way to deal with it all. Great companion pieces for each other - they both get a 10.
