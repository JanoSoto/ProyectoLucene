This film is a masterpiece on so many levels. I'd rank it with the best of modern American film-making, along with Coppola, Kubrick and Scorsese's finest work. Firstly, the way this film is executed despite the tiny budget is nothing short of unbelievable. It made me respect Terry Gilliam in a whole new way. Despite the potential for fancy CG given the subject matter, almost all the scenes of delusions and hallucinations are done using 'analogue' techniques (to brilliant effect) and the few touches of CG are tasteful and blend in well with the immaculately realised early 70s setting. I've heard that the lack of CG was due to funds running out, but I'm very glad this happened.I'm not a big fanboy of the book or its worldview. There are things I deeply admire about Hunter, and things that I detest too. This still doesn't detract from his story or the film based on it. Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas makes me laugh harder than anything else I've ever encountered, even after the number of times I've watched it. Yet it also has some very poignant and atmospheric moments.The film makes you feel, intensely, the dripping sleaze, pouring sweat and hot, dry desert air of Vegas. The psychedelic soundtrack conjures the era at the crumbling end of the revolutionary 60s. You feel the lurching highs and crushing lows of the two main characters' drug binges as vividly as they do. You live their darkly introspective nightmares and spiralling paranoia. And you revel in their lunatic adventures in the vortex of the American dream, urinating in the face of the supposedly wholesome and decent society in which these strange mutants exist.Depp and Del Toro are ridiculously good in this movie - I'd be gobsmacked if they ever produced better performances. Del Toro in particular is a powerhouse, at times he's mercilessly cruel, invincible and terrifying, and at others a hilarious train-wreck. He always remains immensely likable and charismatic - a perfect portrayal of the Dr. Gonzo character. Depp is also great as Hunter, manic and helplessly cowering from his hallucinations while still trying to maintain his composure and eloquence as a journalist. They pull off every scene incredibly well, especially when taking turns to be the 'responsible' minder for his drug-wrecked counterpart, when just as ripped. The supporting cast is also spectacular - the actors playing even small parts like Sven the clerk at the Tropicana, Lacerda the photographer, bellboys, traffic cops, car rental salesmen and countless high profile cameos all display great comic timing and clearly have a good understanding of the material.It is so easy to totally fail to hit the mark with this kind of subject matter, but this is one of the most perfect feature films I've come across. There are never any dull moments and it's a trip in itself. Every scene is a masterful set piece full of energy and brutal humour, and the structure is fluid and compelling. Even though it obviously helps to have great material like Thompson's book to work with (and it is virtually an exact translation of it), it's no mean feat to pull it off in a motion picture format.One of the greatest achievements of this film is the accuracy of its portrayal of drug subculture. Gilliam denies ever having touched a chemical substance in his life, but I find this frankly impossible to believe... the detail and authenticity of his direction is just too good. At no point is the film judgmental, preachy or unrealistic in how it depicts events which most normal people would find horrifying. It shows the highs, excitement and enhanced perspective and perception offered by chemical substances, while showing how they can also reduce you to a shambolic mess. Anyone who thinks this is a pro-drug movie has simply not understood it at all.I highly recommend this movie to all intelligent viewers, especially the Criterion edition which features a lot of extras, including a very good BBC-produced documentary\/interview of Mr. Thompson himself.

The actors have a lot of fun and the story is a splurge of entertainment, but it's not paying enough attention to a couple of things. One of them is what its focus is. Is the film about the murder, the two men solving the murder, the clash of American and Japanese cultures, or what? The other thing the film forgets could be a drawback of the first thing. It's that it doesn't tie up all its loose ends. At the end, there are strands left with no ending, even a mysterious ambiguous one. It just ends because it feels the pace of the film requires it to fade out at that particular point.The film is not bad, mostly because it's far from boring. In fact, there are many scenes of dialogue, despite a few corny scenes of dialogue, that are subtly interesting. We don't quite understand why the exchanges are interesting until later, when we realize that the characters are so deeply contemplated that the scene felt as real as the room you're sitting in. But maybe I'm giving the film too much credit for simply being a load of fun for Michael Crichton to write. After all, he wrote and directed one of the greatest heist films ever made, The Great Train Robbery, also with Sean Connery.Sean Connery, of course, is the highlight of the film, because there's hardly a way he cannot be. Despite his irrepressible suavity, he does not play himself. He plays a resentful, inflexible, self-indulgent veteran cop, and we are supposed to like Wesley Snipes more because the film centers, well, seems to want to center around his character and also we're given more backstory and information on him.

Connery may play a stubborn old jerk, but I'd rather one of those than a pompous, intolerant, overpround young jerk like Snipes can hardly help but play.I cannot reach a verdict on this film.

What started out as just a little story on a yellow legal pad revolutionized the globe and set off a new era in movie making.Star Wars starts out with the now world-known A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away..., and that music that gets people all hyped up. The scroll, as in each Star Wars following film, details what has happened which provides the story of the film.The movie starts on a brilliant note, combining suspense, humor, and action. We meet Darth Vader, who is voiced to perfection by James Earl Jones, and he is definitely the model of any and all villains.However, I think the hype of this film is just a little too high.

The Jerry Lee Lewis character in this movie is not depicted as a real human being for one minute throughout the entire hour and a half plus running time, but then again, all the other characters are only one pencil-stroke from being total cartoon characters.Let's take the beginning. We see Jerry Lee and his cousin, Jimmy Swaggart sneaking over to the black jazz club and we see Jerry getting his inspiration. Might be possible. We see how the two cousins choose different paths in life (also possible). Then we cut to Jerry Lee playing the piano as an adult (now played by Dennis Quaid) and it's thrilling and a little scary. Cut to a scene where he first meets his second cousin, Myra. From then on the whole thing turns into a recap of certain events played out in a style befitting a news reel on high speed.Not that the movie is not a little entertaining and it's great to hear new versions of the songs that made Jerry Lee. Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Swaggart is also a reason why you should at least take a look at this, an indicator of his greater successes in the years to come. Winona Ryder as Myra is the most one noty character in the film. She teases, she sobs, she chews gum and play coquettish and that's about it. There is never for a minute given a reason why she ended up being the third Mrs. Lewis and speaking of wives, where are the first two? That is why this really can't be classified as a biopic, but more of a inaccurate news reel. We see Jerry get his first song played on the radio, we see his second single going into the top ten, we see his third go to no. 1 and so on. Then comes the inevitable downfall.

Here's a hint for all you movie makers out there - real street gangs do not look like glam rockers.The acting is even worse than this would suggest, with only Vincent Perez able to salvage some pride from a cast who run the gamut from abysmal to hilarious.So why two stars rather than one? Two words Iggy Pop. Iggy can't act for toffee - check out his 'horrified' reaction when he finds Nemo's body - but the very fact that this movie has a bona fide legend in it gives it an extra star.

In general, however, there has never been a horror movie that can match the beauty of the 1979 flick, Alien. Story- 10 The plot is not very exciting from the get go. Simply put, the crew of a transport spaceship goes to investigate an SOS signal from a remote planet. While searching, the crew finds an organic lifeform that attach itself to one members face. The crew member is brought back onto the ship, after which all hell breaks loose. Unlike most modern horror movies, Alien uses an enticing and strangely addictive plot to draw the audience into the movie. This in turn increases the scare factor, since the audience is able to feel as though they are on board the ship. The remote location was also revolutionary at the time, as it gives a feeling of no escape. Overall the plot was just executed perfectly. Purpose- 10 Horror movies are meant to scare people and this movie, at least on first viewing, dos just that. For one, we are introduced to a horrifying creature that seems invincible. Byond that, this movie uses the perfect balance of blood and gore that I have ever seen in a horror movie. We cringe during the chesburster scene but we also experience shocking moments such as Dallas' death. At the end of the day, we walk away with a fear of the unknown, a fear of an all powerful creature that is impossible to stop. Acting- 8 The acting wasn't quite perfect, but was able to get the job done and is above average for a horror movie. All of the actors seemed to fit the role of their character. Sigourney Weaver, in my opinion, is a little overrated and she seemed much too tough and determined for her character. At the same time, Veronica Cartwright was a little too emotional, effectively ruining her death scene. The acting didn't need to be great here, it did enough to get the job done. Visuals- 10 They certainly aren't modern, but I love the design of the alien and also the vastness of the massive Nostromo. Once again, the blood wasn't overdone in this movie, even by 70's standards I'm sure for the time the spaceship was very realistic looking. The most important part, however, was the camera angles chosen, for example during the scene in which Brett looks for Jones the cat, and the depiction of isolation that set this movie apart from others. Audio- 10 The soundtrack here is WAY underrated, it sets off just the right mood for the film. It also makes me smile to see how sound plays a large role in this film. It gives a cold feeling, for example, to hear the facehugger organism's slimy movements, or Lambert's death scene. It is a technique underutilized in horror films and should be rethought. Overall 10\/10 I wrote this review first because this is the model I will base other reviews off of. Everything done in this movie is to perfection and it is rare to see this type of execution on the big screen today. Today's directors really need to take a look back to this movie, hopefully they will be able to pull ideas out to create a solid horror film.

It was definitely worth the wait. The film is better than I remembered it to be; that is a real rarity. Not only did the main actors (Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie, George C. Scott) put in stellar performances, but none of those playing the lesser roles fell even remotely short of what should be expected.I really admire Paul Newman's entire career as an actor, and also his truly exalted status as a great citizen who has given back more than anyone can expect. This lead-actor Hustler role is now universally recognized as the one which propelled him into the top echelon; his successful career was truly launched in 1961.But, for me, Jackie Gleason is _the_ memorable actor in The Hustler. Gleason played this role with quite amazing understatement. His performance was totally foreign to his usual brash, comedic, wise-guy persona, and that takes a _great_ actor. I believe Gleason was never honored enough for it; he did receive Best Supporting Actor nominations, but, as far as I know, never garnered those awards.Gleason was so cool, so smooth... He presented an iconic presence that, I think, completely dominated every scene in which he appeared. From now on, Minnesota Fats will forever be remembered as looking, moving, and talking just like Jackie Gleason. The (estate of) the real Minnesota Fats should be proud.On the larger scale, I think The Hustler should be considered a film noir classic, although I have never seen any reviewer mention that aspect. But does not The Hustler possess many film noir characteristics? Cinematically The blues-jazzy filmscore. The black-and-white medium, with many dark scenes lit by one source only. The lack of exposition, leaving the viewer to squint, think, and wonder about scene meanings...Characters Dark and flawed (except, perhaps, for Gleason's Minnesota Fats). Every character pulls the wise-guy quips, in more-or-less failed attempts to conceal their real natures. Even the hero role of Paul Newman is really quite obviously bent, in many respects. Fast Eddie Felson may logically be considered an anti-hero.I admit the usual noir factors of the false and real facades are missing, but to me that is minor. There is no mystery here, just true character development in the search for winning... at the game, and in life overall.I am not a film noir expert, by any means; I am just beginning my collection and study. But, currently, I cannot think of any film as late as 1961 which truly belongs to this genre. Many recent films, of course, pay direct homage to the noir ambiance; Dark City comes immediately to mind. But, if we admit that the true film noir movement is decades dead, then The Hustler may be one of its last masterpieces.I don't think I am watering down my 10 ratings by awarding The Hustler one also. This is just a perfect, classic film.

","genre":"Drama, Sport"},{"date":"15 June 2007","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" After many weeks of back-listed waiting, I finally received Robert Rossen's classic 1961 The Hustler on DVD. It was definitely worth the wait. The film is better than I remembered it to be; that is a real rarity. Not only did the main actors (Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie, George C. Scott) put in stellar performances, but none of those playing the lesser roles fell even remotely short of what should be expected.I really admire Paul Newman's entire career as an actor, and also his truly exalted status as a great citizen who has given back more than anyone can expect. This lead-actor Hustler role is now universally recognized as the one which propelled him into the top echelon; his successful career was truly launched in 1961.But, for me, Jackie Gleason is _the_ memorable actor in The Hustler. Gleason played this role with quite amazing understatement. His performance was totally foreign to his usual brash, comedic, wise-guy persona, and that takes a _great_ actor. I believe Gleason was never honored enough for it; he did receive Best Supporting Actor nominations, but, as far as I know, never garnered those awards.Gleason was so cool, so smooth... He presented an iconic presence that, I think, completely dominated every scene in which he appeared. From now on, Minnesota Fats will forever be remembered as looking, moving, and talking just like Jackie Gleason. The (estate of) the real Minnesota Fats should be proud.On the larger scale, I think The Hustler should be considered a film noir classic, although I have never seen any reviewer mention that aspect. But does not The Hustler possess many film noir characteristics? Cinematically The blues-jazzy filmscore. The black-and-white medium, with many dark scenes lit by one source only. The lack of exposition, leaving the viewer to squint, think, and wonder about scene meanings...Characters Dark and flawed (except, perhaps, for Gleason's Minnesota Fats). Every character pulls the wise-guy quips, in more-or-less failed attempts to conceal their real natures. Even the hero role of Paul Newman is really quite obviously bent, in many respects. Fast Eddie Felson may logically be considered an anti-hero.I admit the usual noir factors of the false and real facades are missing, but to me that is minor. There is no mystery here, just true character development in the search for winning... at the game, and in life overall.I am not a film noir expert, by any means; I am just beginning my collection and study. But, currently, I cannot think of any film as late as 1961 which truly belongs to this genre. Many recent films, of course, pay direct homage to the noir ambiance; Dark City comes immediately to mind.

I loved the ending to this film where Michael is shot over the balcony by Dr Loomis and the way they left it open for the viewers to make up their mind whether he was human or just some sort of supernatural force.

The Mission Impossible trilogy is one of the best series in the spy genre.The first time I watched this film, I was amazed by Woo's awesome action direction and the hard rocking music score by Hans Zimmer. The second time I watched this movie, I was more critical of the plot, which seemingly had a few holes. On my subsequent viewings, however, I think the plot is sound, it just takes a few times watching the movie to understand it completely. Most of the Mission Impossible films have complex story lines; MI2 is no exception.At some point, I hope this movie is released as an unedited DVD so that the film's original 3 and 1\/2 hour running could be viewed as an option to the theatrical release. As I understand it, many plot holes are filled with the longer version.If you don't mind complex thrillers and you enjoy heavy action, then this movie is for you. If you are not a Tom Cruise fan, probably won't like this film since he pays homage to his past movies (the opening seen with the sunglasses sticks out).

In an attempt to satisfy angry viewers, David Lynch continued the story in a feature film, Twin Peaks Fire Walk with Me, only to confuse or irritate even more people when it turned out the film was actually a prequel.On one level, Fire Walk with Me tries to answer certain questions; on the other, it raises more doubts on certain aspects of the series (especially the supernatural ones). This is evident in the prologue, where Regional FBI Chief Gordon Cole (Lynch himself) asks Special Agent Chester Desmond (Chris Isaak) to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks, a waitress with an obscure past. With the help of his partner (Kiefer Sutherland) Desmond starts seeking answers, before mysteriously disappearing and being replaced by Dale Cooper. What happened? We never find out. It seems like the first 32 minutes had the sole purpose of explaining how Cooper got involved in the case, as well as give him the opportunity to say I have the feeling the killer will strike again.And thus the film really begins the familiar Welcome to Twin Peaks sign appears, Angelo Badalamenti's unforgettable theme music kicks in and the focus shifts on the movie's real protagonist, Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). The picture chronicles her last seven days of life, and what a miserable seven days not only is Laura on drugs and unfaithful to her boyfriend, she also does some weird business with the wrong people and is beginning to scare her best friend, Donna Hayward (Moira Kelly), and her parents (Ray Wise and Grace Zabriskie) with her increasingly odd behavior. All of that, however, is nothing compared to the horrors she experiences every night, as she is regularly raped by Bob (Frank Silva), a demon who has been abusing her since she was 12.Although much of what happens on screen had already been told on the show, Lynch chooses to show everything, leaving no room for doubt and delivering some of the most violent images of his career (the final twenty minutes are almost unbearably nightmarish). The film is very affecting, mostly thanks to Lee and Wise's performances, but the feeling that something is missing remains the director's aim in the last episodes of the TV series (and the third season, had it been made) was to clarify Bob's origins, yet we are offered nothing substantial on that subject, and several other questions are left unanswered. What is the real role of The Man From Another Place (Michael J. Anderson) in all this? What exactly is the Black Lodge? How come Laura and Cooper had the same dream several days apart? Whatever explanation there was is probably buried in the hours of footage that was cut from the film, leaving only David Bowie's all too brief cameo to try and sort things out.Another flaw is, even though this is supposed to be a Twin Peaks movie, there isn't enough of what made the TV version unique the movie is entirely Palmer-centric, leaving everyone else out of the picture. There's no sign of Sheriff Truman, Josie Packard, Catherine Martell or the Horne family. Crucially, there isn't enough of Cooper either, reducing MacLachlan to a mere guest star on what used to be his show. This affects the film's tone as well whereas the series kept a balance between tragedy and humor (mostly related to Cooper's immortal Damn good coffee! or Cherry pie that'll kill ya lines), the movie is relentlessly bleak and scary throughout, with not a single moment of lightness to provide some relief.Overall, a bit of a frustrating experience it is not what most people would expect, and some will probably be turned off by the dark tone and lack of answers, but in the end Twin Peaks Fire Walk with Me is a compelling film, and proves to be a worthy closure for what seems to be the best mainstream television product of all time.

The picture chronicles her last seven days of life, and what a miserable seven days not only is Laura on drugs and unfaithful to her boyfriend, she also does some weird business with the wrong people and is beginning to scare her best friend, Donna Hayward (Moira Kelly), and her parents (Ray Wise and Grace Zabriskie) with her increasingly odd behavior. All of that, however, is nothing compared to the horrors she experiences every night, as she is regularly raped by Bob (Frank Silva), a demon who has been abusing her since she was 12.Although much of what happens on screen had already been told on the show, Lynch chooses to show everything, leaving no room for doubt and delivering some of the most violent images of his career (the final twenty minutes are almost unbearably nightmarish). The film is very affecting, mostly thanks to Lee and Wise's performances, but the feeling that something is missing remains the director's aim in the last episodes of the TV series (and the third season, had it been made) was to clarify Bob's origins, yet we are offered nothing substantial on that subject, and several other questions are left unanswered. What is the real role of The Man From Another Place (Michael J. Anderson) in all this? What exactly is the Black Lodge? How come Laura and Cooper had the same dream several days apart? Whatever explanation there was is probably buried in the hours of footage that was cut from the film, leaving only David Bowie's all too brief cameo to try and sort things out.Another flaw is, even though this is supposed to be a Twin Peaks movie, there isn't enough of what made the TV version unique the movie is entirely Palmer-centric, leaving everyone else out of the picture. There's no sign of Sheriff Truman, Josie Packard, Catherine Martell or the Horne family. Crucially, there isn't enough of Cooper either, reducing MacLachlan to a mere guest star on what used to be his show. This affects the film's tone as well whereas the series kept a balance between tragedy and humor (mostly related to Cooper's immortal Damn good coffee! or Cherry pie that'll kill ya lines), the movie is relentlessly bleak and scary throughout, with not a single moment of lightness to provide some relief.Overall, a bit of a frustrating experience it is not what most people would expect, and some will probably be turned off by the dark tone and lack of answers, but in the end Twin Peaks Fire Walk with Me is a compelling film, and proves to be a worthy closure for what seems to be the best mainstream television product of all time.

In an attempt to satisfy angry viewers, David Lynch continued the story in a feature film, Twin Peaks Fire Walk with Me, only to confuse or irritate even more people when it turned out the film was actually a prequel.On one level, Fire Walk with Me tries to answer certain questions; on the other, it raises more doubts on certain aspects of the series (especially the supernatural ones). This is evident in the prologue, where Regional FBI Chief Gordon Cole (Lynch himself) asks Special Agent Chester Desmond (Chris Isaak) to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks, a waitress with an obscure past. With the help of his partner (Kiefer Sutherland) Desmond starts seeking answers, before mysteriously disappearing and being replaced by Dale Cooper. What happened? We never find out.

Besides being a great film, it has so many of my favorites.Staring with the director, Martin Scorsese, who did this just before Goodfellas. I can imagine that he took a lot of heat for this film, which depicts Jesus (Willem Dafoe) doing things that we all do, like getting married, and making explicit and sensual, but not pornographic love with the luscious Barbara Hershey (with tattoos and lots of mascara) as Mary Magdalene. Do you think The Davinci Code was right? here is the evidence.Harvey Keitel, another favorite, was especially great as Judas; I just like seeing him act. And, David Bowie as Pontius Pilate. Who thought up that one? He was magnificent! This is no sappy Christ picture. It is harsh and real and angry. Christ is depicted with a rabble-rousing fervor. He has doubts and doesn't feel that he is worthy. He even steps down from his mission to raise a family. You have to look at this with an open mind and still it may be hard to take. In this film, Christ not above us, and above our weaknesses, but on a level with us, and prone to the same doubts and temptations.With lots of blood and Peter Gabriel's music, the film is a feast for the senses.

The location used for the Pizza Parlor in the film is actually in the Borough of Stonington which is situated on the water, between Mystic and Pawcatuck.
