It was about three years ago; during the second month of the first year of my degree in film studies. Up until this point in my life, I hadn't really been the sort to actively track down and watch foreign films, never mind foreign language films. But viewing La Haine then and going into that screening having never heard of the film and having never seen any scenes from it prior to the screening, I can safely say this film changed all that. This was one of the few times on the course in which nobody, and I mean nobody, walked out of a screening &#x96; we all sat and watched, a little stunned but thoroughly engaged throughout. When the final act of violence arrived in the final scene, one person in the audience even let out a feint obscenity &#x96; something that no other film on the degree moved anyone else, at least sitting near me, to do.Such was and still is the power of La Haine, a film that I purchased on DVD the following summer and have viewed a couple of times since &#x96; each time the film retaining that gritty first impression. Right from the off, the film gives us that juxtaposed feeling that will continue throughout the experience. Scenes and footage of riots on the streets of Paris are presented with a mellow if not slightly upbeat Reggae song playing over the top of it conflicting the nasty images with the sweetly sounding music. It is an idea the film carries throughout its runtime but is one more focused on specific characters and their actions more than anything. After the credits have ended, the first shot is a hair raising slow track into the face of Saïd (Taghmaoui). Saïd has his eyes closed and the accompanying sound effect is an eerie echoing noise. His eyes open just as the camera gets to him and then flicks round to end up behind his head; his point of view. We see what he sees police officers and dogs lined up against a series of police vans. I feel this is the film immediately suggesting we see the film through his eyes; through his perspective and the eerie sound effects as well as the fact his eyes are initially closed suggest an air of anonymity as we enter his mindset.But the film does not revolve around Saïd for the entire duration. His two friends complete a threesome of young Frenchmen; one of which is of North African descent (Hubert, played by Hubert Koundé) and Vinz, (played by Vincent Cassel) who is of Jewish descent. Notice how these actors and their Christian names are the same as their character's, suggesting a neo-realistic approach. But when we shift to these perspectives, it is to remind us that Hubert has a dream to get out of the suburb he is in and when we focus on Vinz half way through the film for certain reasons, we do so to highlight the dangers a young, white male in these areas of Paris faces. When we cut to Vinz for this sequence, he says so very little but he will witness in this time a shooting, a murder and a further example of risks of influence to young males going down a similar route when an even younger male than himself tries to copy him smoking in a cinema.The fact of the matter is that La Haine is a film that employs several different techniques and ideas to the idea that three kids on their own are punching well above their weight. On the surface, the film would like us to think the police are the 'bad guys' but there are no 'bad guys' in European cinema and La Haine sort of invites us to see both sides of the argument. Yes the film is shot from the perspective of the youths and yes, director Kassovitz was inspired to do the film through an act of police brutality but Hubert's gym was trashed during the rioting presumably by the youths and the plain clothed policeman that pops up at various points in the film is fair, level headed and put across as an upstanding guy who will help the kids when they need it and shake their hands afterward.It would be too easy to be seduced by the antics of Saïd, Hubert and Vinz and it would be too easy to say their activities are glamorised by the film. When you break the film down, being arrested; interrogated and humiliated; having someone pressure you into playing Russian Roulette; having to take drugs to escape reality and getting into life or death situations with skinheads does not sound like the sort of roster you'd want to be apart of. But then again La Haine does carry a very distinct air of the documentary. In the background people, presumably real, watch on from ground level and apartment windows as the actors act and the camera rolls; the camera itself is hand-held adding to the urgency of certain situations.The film carries a certain atmosphere. Is Vinz perhaps schizophrenic? The first time we see his character is a bizarre dance-dream sequence and he constantly talks of seeing a cow in the streets, maybe he's hallucinating? This added with the fact he carries a gun the whole time and is easily aggressive adds a whole new sub-dimension to the film something to get distracted by and yet it never takes centre stage. La Haine is a film that remains powerful and engaging every time I see it, plus it just carries that air that films like this don't get made anymore and that is a great shame.

I've seen several film versions of the hunting-humans concept and loved them all; except for one (the abominable 60's bore Bloodlust!). Irving Pichel and Ernest B. Schoedsack's original 30's classic The Most Dangerous Game undoubtedly remains the greatest version, but I particularly love how there exist numerous variations on the theme, like an excessively violent one set on a futuristic prison island (Blood Camp Thatcher) or a super-sleazy one where they exclusively hunt scarcely dressed girls (Eddie Romero's The Woman Hunt). Surviving the Game is a rather rudimentary re-working of the premise, but nonetheless a very effective one with a downright awesome cast listing and a handful of genuine shocks. Jack Mason is an embittered and suicidal homeless man who loses his last will to live when both his dog and best friend in one day. The sly businessman Thomas Burns lures Mason to the wilderness with a false job promise, but instead he and his maniacal rich friends simply intend to hunt down Mason like an animal and kill him for sports. Mason may be suicidal, but he still wants to decide for himself when he dies, and so he successfully fights back. Surviving the Game is quite a gruesome and nihilistic-toned film; definitely not for people with vulnerable stomachs. The violence is pretty gratuitous and served without any form of morality, but what else do you expect from a B-movie. As indicated above, the film's main trump is the cast and particularly because each and every cool actor depicts a marvelously eccentric character. I can't even pick a favorite performance between F.

Other examples include Polanski's Chinatown, the Michael Winner remake of The Big Sleep, Lawrence Kasdan's Body Heat and Curtis Hanson's more recent L.A. Confidential.The title is derived from the well-known cocktail which has three ingredients, tequila, orange juice, and grenadine. Mel Gibson is seen drinking this cocktail on a couple of occasions, but the significance of the title may be that the film explores the triangular relationship between a cocktail of three main characters, Dale Mac McKussic, Nick Frescia and Jo Ann Vallinari. (The film was advertised in France under the slogan Un Cocktail Explosif).Mac is a former drug dealer who claims that he is now trying to go straight.

An immortal can only be killed by decapitation, a war has raged between immortals for centuries until only two remain, Connor & an evil Russian dude named the Kurgan (Clancy Brown) who has an attitude problem. Now in 80's New York the last two immortals meet for the ultimate prize, some form of supernatural power that will gift the winner unimaginable powers & possibly spell the end of the human race if Kurgan wins...This seemingly very popular American British co-production was directed by Russell Mulcahy & I have to say while I thought it was alright I don't think it quite deserves the stellar reputation it has amongst some, far be it from me to say what someone should enjoy but I just don't see anything particularly special here in Highlander at all. Originally released in the US in a slightly cut down 110 minute version the longer European cut ran 116 minutes & that is the one I will be basing my comments on. The script by Gregory Widen, Peter Bellwood & Larry Ferguson is certainly ambitious in it's central concept with a secret race of ancient immortals who have waged a private war with each other for centuries in order to obtain some secret power that will let whoever has it rule the Earth but the mishmash of ideas never really came together that well for me. The film constantly flips forwards & back in time to tell the story that is unfolding in present day New York but at the same time weaves plenty of flashbacks to the past to reveal how the current situation came about, certainly for the first hour or so Highlander never really settles down which some may like but I didn't to be honest. Just as I was getting used to one location & one set of character's the film suddenly switches back or forward to a different time-line which doesn't really give time for character's to develop. There are some odd comedy relief moments too which I thought were out of place & there's a distinct lack of explanation for a lot of what happened including any sort of background on who the immortals as a race were or where they came from. I think the main message of the film is that knowledge is the real power as evidenced by the ability MacCleod receives at the end. Having said that it moves along at a decent pace, it's certainly something different, there's some pretty good sci-fi set-pieces & it kept me entertained for a couple of hours if nothing else.Highlander resembles a music video at times with the way it's lit, very staged fighting scenes & director Mulcahy constantly starts a shot out wide & then has his camera move in closer on the action or the scene to presumably get some sort of sense of scale. This technique gives Highlander quite an epic feel at times as there are many wide shots which reveal a lot of scope & scale. The fight scenes are alright, there are some sword fights, a couple of mild decapitations & a slightly cheap looking action scene in which a car drives on the wrong side of the road. I must admit I only saw this a few hours ago & none of the set-pieces really stand out in my memory & I'm having a hard time thinking of them.With a fairly modest budget of $16,000,000 Highlander is well made with decent production values although some of the optical effects look very dated. Filmed in New York, Scotland, Wales & London. Rock band Queen provided some of the very out of place sounding songs & music. The acting is, well, OK I suppose. Lambert can't really act, Clancy Brown overacts wildly while the always watchable Sean Connery brings a bit of class to proceedings in a small role.Highlander is an alright sci-fi film that tries to be out there & different & it is to be fair to it but that doesn't automatically mean it's any good, does it?

This one has an oil company called Petrox going to Skull Island to get oil. The expedition is run by evil Fred Wilson (Charles Grodin). Nice guy Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges looking like a hippie) is a stowaway who becomes their photographer. They find beautiful Dwan (Jessica Lange in her movie debut) stranded in the middle of the ocean. They get to the island, Dwan is offered as a sacrifice to Kong--but he falls in love with her. He's captured and bought to New York where he breaks loose and climbs the Word Trade Center with Dwan in his clutches.OK--this is not a good movie. However I saw it at the age of 14 in a movie theatre and was blown away by it. I found it big, exciting, funny and sad. Also people seem to forget that this DID have defenders. There were many positive reviews--even the legendary critic Pauline Kael gave it a good review in The New Yorker! Still this has been regarded as a total bomb and derided from all sides. But I prefer this over that overblown Peter Jackson remake that ran an unnecessary three hours.First of all the special effects are great. Kong's face is incredibly expressive. You can SEE what he's feeling. Also I do like the fact that Lange doesn't scream nonstop like Fay Wray did in the original. The scenes between her and Kong include incredible special effects--and some of the most laughable lines in screen history! Lange TALKS to the ape--You g**damn chauvinist pig ape! I'm a Libra. What sign are you? I mean COME ON!!!! There are plenty of things wrong with this though. The dialogue is dreadful--full of stupid jokes that are meant to be ironic (I guess). Get a load of the (very obviously) fake giant snake Kong fights on Skull Island! When they hit New York continuity goes flying out the window. Kong (somehow) finds Dwan in a small underground bar.

It was however a classic because people back then were scared s**tless of that kind of stuff. The violence and nudity was so taboo at the time that it made for a fascinating watch, the story was almost believable and most of all it truly scared people.

There was no way this film was ever going to surpass the reviews its original got, it was labelled a failure from the start and whether they like to admit it or not a true horror buff cannot go into this film without a tremendous amount of scepticism that will take a lot to overcome. I am not a fan of Rob Zombie's films. I agree that modern day horror films need to go to extraordinarily extreme and somewhat sickening lengths to achieve a shock value (Hostel\/Devils Rejects), but unlike films such as SAW, Rob fails to back his films up with intensity and mind twisting story lines.

Surely the Japanese had more devious methods of torture than simply having officers stand all day in the hot sun, or placing their commander in solitary confinement, as miserable as either of those situations may have been. And it is doubtful the Japanese commandant would have been talked out of shooting several prisoners simply because it is pointed out to him there might be an inquiry into the matter. Those matters aside, 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' is very compelling and believable, the story of a large group of British soldiers led by Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), and one American, Commander Shears (William Holden), being held in a desolate Japanese prison camp in southern Burma during WW2. At the center of the story is a battle of wills between Nicholson and the Japanese camp commander Saito (Sessue Hayakawa). Nicholson's defiance is genuine, but it is done in that peculiarly quirky British fashion which seems, especially in the film's latter sections, exaggerated to an almost unfathomable degree. When Nicholson finally agrees to build the bridge across the Kwai River that Saito wants built, he not only tackles the project with enthusiasm, he determines to build a better bridge than the Japanese themselves would have built. He doesn't regard what he's doing as traitorous; rather, he sees it as a way to keep his men busy and the bridge itself as a monument to their hard work while in captivity. One very interesting sidebar in the film is the contrast between Nicholson and Shears, and by implication, the British and American approach to war and life in captivity. Nicholson lives by certain codes and traditions and would rather die than violate them, even if they come to seem inexplicable in their practical results. Shears, on the other hand, is crafty and resourceful and doesn't give a damn about rules or regulations. He routinely bribes the guards to get out of performing physical labor. To him, the ends justify the means every time. He regards Nicholson and the other British officers as fools, and they regard him as a crazy American, gone slightly off his rocker from being a prisoner so long. Guinness gives one of his finest performances and deservedly won an Oscar (as did the movie itself, and the director, David Lean). The miserable conditions of the camp, and particularly the 'box' where Nicholson spends his solitary confinement, are very realistically presented; the unrelenting jungle heat is palpable. The characterizations are such that we are in sympathy with Colonel Nicholson, though we suspect he isn't completely rational, just as we come to dislike the character of Shears, even as we realize he is doing the right thing in blowing up the bridge.

Hollywood directors generally chose to be hip. The significance of this fact should become apparent in due course. Now, a little boring history for those who can stomach it U.S. troops were present in large numbers in South Vietnam from roughly 1962 to 1972. U.S. troops came home in '72, having successfully strengthened the South Vietnamese army (ARVN) so that it could defend South Vietnam from invasion by the North Vietnamese communists and from subversion by the South Vietnamese communist Viet Cong. The ARVN did, in fact, successfully defend South Vietnam for almost three years. Then, a Democrat-controlled Congress cut off funding to the South Vietnamese in the wake of Republican President Nixon's resignation over the Watergate scandal. The North Vietnamese invaded, and South Vietnam fell. Soon thereafter, the Communist Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia and tortured and murdered some two million innocent men, women and children. This is the true tragedy of the Vietnam war -- something that no Hollywood director to my knowledge has touched (The Killing Fields is not accompanied by a political explanation of the Cambodian Holocaust.)Four years after the fall of South Vietnam, and seven years after U.S. troops left the country, Francis Ford Coppola made Apocalypse Now. He was one of a slew of Hollywood directors who sought to capitalize on the deep well of anti-war sentiment in the United States. Well, let's examine such anti-war sentiment for a minute. Being anti-war is fine, but those who are against war are called upon to offer alternatives that work -- and they never do. Instead, they hold up the UN as some sort of ideal -- a UN made up mostly of undemocratic countries with no respect for human rights.In the end, the Vietnam War was but one of a series of proxy wars between the communist Soviet Union (at times allied with communist China) and the capitalist West. The Korean War was the first major battle in this rivalry, where both sides sought to extend their influence while bleeding and demoralizing the other side. These proxy wars were a substitute for all-out nuclear war. Terrible things were done by both sides in this conflict, but I believe that the U.S. cause was a noble one. And it largely succeeded, in that the Soviet Union collapsed and freedom and prosperity expanded into Eastern Europe. But the conduct of the Vietnam War by U.S. politicians was terrible at best. U.S. soldiers never lost a battle in Vietnam. But politicians in Washington would not allow them to keep the territory they had won. They refused to follow Barry Goldwater's advice, which was to Win, or get the hell out! They failed to mine Haiphong Harbor in North Vietnam to keep Soviet and communist Chinese supplies out of that country. They refused to invade Laos and Cambodia in order to close down the weapons supply line that ran along the Ho Chi Minh trail, ending only thirty miles from Saigon, the South Vietnamese capital.In the meantime, Vietnam was the first televised war, and the U.S. media were largely left-wing (as they are today) and anti-war. During the Tet Offensive (a major defeat for the communists, and a major victory for the Americans), Walter Cronkite declared that America had failed in Vietnam. This was just one of many distortions by the media. The American public stopped supporting the war. And some celebrities -- like Jane Fonda -- actually rooted for victory by the communists. What, then, do we see in Apocalypse Now? Nothing more than all the one-sidedly anti-American, anti-Vietnam-war stereotypes of the day playing Wagner (subtle; I don't suppose that could be a suggestion that the Americans were the equivalent of Nazis?); showing a giggling soldier-moron in a helicopter randomly machine gunning innocent Vietnamese peasants (subtle; I don't suppose that could be a suggestion that the Americans were the equivalent of Nazis?); and so on and so forth. Of course, Coppola wasn't satisfied addressing such substantive issues. His movie had to be a grand vision -- not unlike his The Godfather. So he threw everything except the kitchen sink into this movie the pretentious linkage he tried to make between his magnum opus and Conrad's The Heart of Darkness -- Wow, man! That's heavy! Copolla is our Conrad!; the psychedelic\/surreal affectations (a first!); the ironic and clever juxtapositions (a battle mixed up with surfing); the revelation of Ugly American insensitivity; and so on. Well, Copolla was preaching to the choir with this movie, and in this he was a great success. But there is no significance to this movie otherwise. If you really want to see enlightening scenes from Vietnam, rent the multi-disc documentary on the war (I forget the title; there are several.) One very moving scene shows U.S. soldiers singing Silent Night on the flare-lit battle-field on Christmas eve. Watching a documentary on the war might actually teach you something about that war -- a first! Otherwise, you're going to have to settle for Hollywood's version from the likes of Oliver Stone and Coppola. The true subject of Coppola's movie, in my opinion, is Coppola's giant ego. The main secondary subject is the dumbing down of an American public that would uncritically eat up his vision; the exact same thing is true of Oliver Stone's various movies. Hollywood thinks that Epatez les bourgeois! is the last word in creativity, even when its arrows fall far short of the target. That is the reason why most serious Hollywood movies, in my opinion, are overblown failures. And Coppola's Apocalypse Now surely stands at the very front of the line of those failures.

Being anti-war is fine, but those who are against war are called upon to offer alternatives that work -- and they never do. Instead, they hold up the UN as some sort of ideal -- a UN made up mostly of undemocratic countries with no respect for human rights.In the end, the Vietnam War was but one of a series of proxy wars between the communist Soviet Union (at times allied with communist China) and the capitalist West. The Korean War was the first major battle in this rivalry, where both sides sought to extend their influence while bleeding and demoralizing the other side. These proxy wars were a substitute for all-out nuclear war. Terrible things were done by both sides in this conflict, but I believe that the U.S. cause was a noble one. And it largely succeeded, in that the Soviet Union collapsed and freedom and prosperity expanded into Eastern Europe. But the conduct of the Vietnam War by U.S. politicians was terrible at best. U.S. soldiers never lost a battle in Vietnam. But politicians in Washington would not allow them to keep the territory they had won. They refused to follow Barry Goldwater's advice, which was to Win, or get the hell out! They failed to mine Haiphong Harbor in North Vietnam to keep Soviet and communist Chinese supplies out of that country. They refused to invade Laos and Cambodia in order to close down the weapons supply line that ran along the Ho Chi Minh trail, ending only thirty miles from Saigon, the South Vietnamese capital.In the meantime, Vietnam was the first televised war, and the U.S. media were largely left-wing (as they are today) and anti-war. During the Tet Offensive (a major defeat for the communists, and a major victory for the Americans), Walter Cronkite declared that America had failed in Vietnam. This was just one of many distortions by the media. The American public stopped supporting the war. And some celebrities -- like Jane Fonda -- actually rooted for victory by the communists. What, then, do we see in Apocalypse Now? Nothing more than all the one-sidedly anti-American, anti-Vietnam-war stereotypes of the day playing Wagner (subtle; I don't suppose that could be a suggestion that the Americans were the equivalent of Nazis?); showing a giggling soldier-moron in a helicopter randomly machine gunning innocent Vietnamese peasants (subtle; I don't suppose that could be a suggestion that the Americans were the equivalent of Nazis?); and so on and so forth. Of course, Coppola wasn't satisfied addressing such substantive issues. His movie had to be a grand vision -- not unlike his The Godfather. So he threw everything except the kitchen sink into this movie the pretentious linkage he tried to make between his magnum opus and Conrad's The Heart of Darkness -- Wow, man! That's heavy! Copolla is our Conrad!; the psychedelic\/surreal affectations (a first!); the ironic and clever juxtapositions (a battle mixed up with surfing); the revelation of Ugly American insensitivity; and so on. Well, Copolla was preaching to the choir with this movie, and in this he was a great success. But there is no significance to this movie otherwise. If you really want to see enlightening scenes from Vietnam, rent the multi-disc documentary on the war (I forget the title; there are several.) One very moving scene shows U.S. soldiers singing Silent Night on the flare-lit battle-field on Christmas eve. Watching a documentary on the war might actually teach you something about that war -- a first! Otherwise, you're going to have to settle for Hollywood's version from the likes of Oliver Stone and Coppola. The true subject of Coppola's movie, in my opinion, is Coppola's giant ego. The main secondary subject is the dumbing down of an American public that would uncritically eat up his vision; the exact same thing is true of Oliver Stone's various movies. Hollywood thinks that Epatez les bourgeois! is the last word in creativity, even when its arrows fall far short of the target. That is the reason why most serious Hollywood movies, in my opinion, are overblown failures. And Coppola's Apocalypse Now surely stands at the very front of the line of those failures.

Today, after years of rediscovery by fans of the stars Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, it's considered a classic of the 'screwball' school of comedy, where the timing was graceful and the structure solid in the midst of madcap madness and silliness that involves specific, quirky personalities that should but don't quite always meld (hence the blueprint for many a romantic comedy for today). For me, it's not a flop nor is it quite as classic as I expected. It's a very fun escapade with two stars who often shine with their qualities to subvert (Grant) and meet (Hepburn) expectations of what they have to offer.Grant is akin here to Clark Kent, nerdy and awkward and just wanting to be left alone, but somehow being drawn into trouble (and, after all, wouldn't Grant make a good Kent\/Superman?) Hepburn, meanwhile, can be very charming and lovable and also annoying in equal measure (though I'm sure the latter is part of the point with her character). They're a solid, combined force for Hawks's mildly crazy tale of two people who shouldn't have anything to do with one another but are put together under circumstances of the zany and funny a dog with a dinosaur bone, and a baby leopard that's tame and actually a pet but is at first thought to be out of the zoo (that is, until, its doppleganger shows up in the last third of the movie). We're led along on their adventures over a day and night to find the bone and the leopard, and how they confound and amuse and annoy those around them from family to policemen to possible betrothed (Grant's character).There are some classic moments, to be sure; I loved how Hepburn talks her way out of prison by sinking down to the level of mimicry that is totally lost on the cop; the chemistry between the two stars fluctuates wonderfully, depending on the scene or situation, like by the fire out in the wilderness; Grant is often so uncomfortable that we forget (for better or worse) how charismatic he usually is in place of this bumbling, meek but curious character; the dress gag, simply, is a riot, as is the bit with the robe (I'm gay! is a line that gets a laugh for other reasons today). But at the same time it's not totally a riot all the way through, with some moments falling kind of flat or just oh, that's funny as opposed to laugh-out-loud variety. It should appeal heavily to those who eat up romantic comedies like Hershey's kisses, as should die-hards for the two stars, and if it's on TV on a rainy day it's surely a must-see for at least a few minutes. That it's maybe not quite one of Hawks's best is up for minor debate.

I never laughed so much.One of the film's most unpleasant aspects is seeing Rex Harrison getting it on with Elizabeth Taylor. A truly unsexy sex scene if there ever was one. We hardly see Taylor as a pregnant Cleopatra and when she does deliver the baby, in the next scene she's already sporting an hour-glass figure, wearing a tight dress showcasing her narrow waistline. Again, I never laughed so much. Couldn't they just have waited a few more scenes before shoving Taylor in another ghastly bosom revealing dress? Like I said before, the only thing going for it is the production values. Some of it is truly grand and some of it is simply grand Kitsch with a capital K, certainly Cleopatra's arrival by boat. I mean, come on. But all of this excess amounts to nothing if the characters are more wooden and cardboard than the actual sets themselves. The entire moment when Cleopatra arrives in Rome with her son is long and detailed. It's over-the-top, for sure but I wish they had spent more time coming up with a carefully constructed script with unforgettable characters or portrayals than all that glitz. When the Cleopatra's Arrival in Rome show is finally over, it's only a few minutes after that that Caesar is killed. After going though all that trouble of mounting such and elaborate and expensive but alas empty scene, when the death of Caesar occurs, I really wondered why they bothered coming up with that time wasting scene only to kill Caesar a few minutes afterwards in the silliest possible way. His death should have been pivotal. Instead we have this big bloated corpse of a movie.

I saw the Seven Samurai much after I saw this movie and again recently which got my interest to see this movie again. The thing that struck me the most was how much of old innocence this movie has with good guys clearly depicted as heroes, and bad guys are - well bad guys. There are no complicated character back ground, just pretty cool guys fighting for the oppressed. The other thing that struck me was how young Steve McQueen, and James Coburn looks in this movie, and other five guys are also very different types of hero actors from today. This is probably the first of big westerns that marked the '60s. Everything about the '60s was big, and the Magnificent Seven lead the way for other big western movies that followed. It also set the careers of few actors in this movie. I like this movie for what it is A good western. Things were simpler back then, and the movie serves as a touch stone to that time. Kurosawa's Seven Samurai had more believability to it than this movie, and asides from it's cinematography, would still stand up as a contemporary movie, but Magnificent Seven if it was made today, the believability would be far less than the Kurosawa's original. This is probably Chris is no longer a type of hero we see as real today as opposed to Kambei character in the Seven Samurai can be found among us today. So this film to me is not aging very well, but still to me, when I think of classic western movie, I think of this one.

One morning, John tries to stop a group of gang members (The Ghetto Ghouls, apparently based on the notorious South Bronx street gang The Savage Skulls) from stealing cases of beer from a storage container at the market, and nearly gets his throat cut for his trouble. Jefferson rescues Eastland once again (as he did in Vietnam), but of course their trouble is far from over. When the gang catches up with Jefferson and leaves him paralyzed and fighting for his life at Lincoln Hospital, Eastland begins his campaign of vengeance. During the course of this extremely violent movie, Eastland avenges not only his old friend, but other victims as well, using blowtorches, a meat grinder,an M-16 and a .44 Magnum loaded with mercury-filled dum-dum bullets as he systematically takes out mobsters, chickenhawks and other assorted street scum.Critics of this movie have contended that Eastland's violence is too randomly directed after initially taking out the gang bangers who hurt his friend. My feeling is that Eastland had been suppressing a lot of rage since Vietnam, and had been seething over the deteriorating conditions of his city, and that the mugging of Jefferson was the last straw. After avenging his friend, Eastland decides to wage war against every criminal and degenerate that he sees. Of course, this being the cynical seventies, the NYPD detective assigned to the case (himself a Nam vet) would just as soon let The Exterminator continue to clean up the streets, but it is an election year, and public officials are embarrassed by the fact that The Exterminator is succeeding in eliminating crime where they have failed. The federal government actually believes that The Exterminator may be a foreign agent working to undermine the current administration, and sends a CIA operative into the city to investigate. By the end of the story, the CIA assassin only THINKS he has exterminated The Exterminator - and, as Eastland has promised in the past, I'll be back. When creating the character of John Eastland, James Glickenhaus was obviously influenced by Robert DeNiro's deranged Vietnam vet Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver and by Charles Bronson's Paul Kersey character, who was affected by violence to the point that he was himself driven to violence in Death Wish. But in spite of this (and in spite of criticisms that Ginty's character is stiff and wooden), The Exterminator emerges as an interesting character study of a traumatized man who unravels under the stress of life in inner-city New York after the senseless violence of that place strikes a little too close to home.Those of us New Yorkers who are old enough to remember that city back in those bad old days of the late '70s - early '80s will agree that The Exterminator captures the grit and grime of places like the South Bronx and Times Square, as well as the lawlessness and general chaos of the place. Thank God the place has been cleaned up somewhat.
