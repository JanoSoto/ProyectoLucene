But I loved it.As only the charmingly cynical Billy Crystal can give us, this is the story of what happens AFTER happily ever after. It exposes all the warts & blemishes & dirty socks that plague an average dysfunctional couple but does it in a funny way that never feels upsetting, disturbing or depressing. Still, don't see it with anyone you're remotely romantic with because it will certainly dispel the charm.On the other hand, if you are already in a dysfunctional relationship, maybe on the verge of a divorce or breakup, then definitely SEE THIS MOVIE. It can be cathartic, better than any $200\/hr marriage therapist. After all, what do you have to lose, you miserable schlep?Told in an interesting, non-linear, Citizen Kane way (i.e. told in flashback through the subjective interpretations of different characters), it carries a mounting sense of mystery and suspense that keeps you guessing until the very end. That's what separates it from the standard dysfunctional rom-com (romance on the Orient Express?). Agatha Christie would be proud.Where this movie falls slightly short, and the reason why I'm docking it a few stars, is the chemistry between Billy Crystal and Debra Winger. Though both fine actors, I never found them convincing as a couple, not the way we saw with Billy Crystal & Meg Ryan a few years earlier in When Harry Met Sally. But sheesh, nothing will ever touch that movie, it was so perfect.Forget Paris is a great movie to watch and remind yourself that love isn't always Valentine's Day & rose-covered mattresses.

What's funny is 2001 isn't even my favourite movie. But I believe it tells the story of humankind better than anything else I've ever seen on the big screen. Essentially it asks the age old question what is the meaning of life?, and for my money, it provides a very satisfying answer.What makes it such a phenomenal work of art is that it is able to address some of the most divisive, incompatible human attitudes (in particular, religion) and present us with a model that we ALL can accept. Judeo-Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Scientologists, Fundamentalists, Existentialists, Atheists and even Satanists can find truth in this film because it applies no labels. Like the mysterious yet commanding black box that appears in the film, it remains exactly that a sealed black box which can be anything we choose to see.The black box may represent God. Or it may represent science. Or it may represent history. Or it may represent individuality. Make up your own mind, and you will learn a little something of yourself. Really, this movie is like a puzzle with infinite solutions, designed to teach us about ourselves by what we see in it. It's truly interactive. No other film has ever made me feel this way.The plot is almost irrelevant, so I won't bother summarizing. What you should pay attention to are the themes and questions the movie addresses.1) Are we alone in the universe? 2) Is there a point to life? 3) Are we heading in the right direction?By the time the movie ends, you should have an answer to all three, and yet all our answers will be different.SO WHAT THE HECK IS THE MOVIE ABOUT? OK, since you've read this far, I'll give you an idea. The movie is about evolution. Not just your Darwinian natural selection stuff, but a compelling proposal that evolution was (or continues to be?) guided by some extraordinary force. If you like, this is the marriage of God & science that we've all been waiting for. Or if you like, it's a testament to pure science. Or pure God. Like I said, Kubrick allows for every possibility. And I have to hand it to him for remaining so tight-lipped that nobody ever knew what his personal feelings were on the matter.The film starts in prehistoric times with a tribe of moribund ape-like creatures on the edge of either extinction or excellence. Then we jump ahead a million years or so to find humans in a similar state of stagnation yet on the edge of another fantastic evolutionary step forward. Finally we jump forward to catch a glimpse of what evolution may have in store for us in the not-too-distant future. If it sounds like a documentary, I suppose it almost is, except without Marlon Perkins talking over it. We are expected to fill in the details ourselves, and that is the beauty of what this film does. It takes a purely objective approach and manages to lead us to our own satisfying conclusions.A word of caution. I don't think you're supposed to get this film on one viewing. I certainly didn't, and I've never met anyone who did. Even Roger Ebert (who ranks this as the greatest film of all time) was initially lukewarm about it when it premiered in '68. So if you feel like you just got cheated, or if you have no idea what everyone's raving about, please be patient and give it some time to sink in. I saw this movie when I was 16 and loved the middle part but hated the ending. Decades later I saw it again and suddenly understood it better. But I confess there's still a lot I haven't realized.

I have recently finished watching it and I am really unsure on what to make of it. Urm, is it good? Not really. Is it bad? Not really. I just don't know what to say about it.The story is about Sean Penn's character, Bobby. He is driving through the desert on route to Vegas to pay off a gambling debt. A debt that has already cost him two fingers. Whilst driving, his radiator hose bursts and the closest place to get it fixed is a little town called Superior. He pulls into a typical looking garage for a deserted town such as this, and is greeted by a fat, hillbilly which is Billy Bob Thornton (who is actually pretty good). Bobby leaves the car in the mechanics hands and heads off to get a drink. Whilst walking through the town he meets Grace (Lopez) and an instant sexual attraction takes place. He ends up helping her put up drapes back at her home but when things heat up her husband (Nolte) arrives home and punches Bobby in the nose. Bobby then leaves the house but is tailed by Jake (J Lo's husband) and is offered money to kill his wife as he can't stand her. Bobby is unsure but when his bag of money is stolen in a grocery shop robbery, he realises he needs the money to pay off his debt or lose more of his fingers. However as he is about to kill her she offers him another proposition, kill her husband and steal his stash of cash he keeps under the floor boards. From here on Bobby must contemplate which route to take. He tries the easy option, to leave the town but the mechanics ridiculous charge for a radiator hose leaves Bobby's beloved Mustang in the mechanic's compound until he pays up. Bobby has no choice, but what will he do to get the money.The story does sound quite intriguing but everything just seems to fall in place far too easily. The characters don't force the plot twists, they just seem to randomly happen and Penn is left turning backwards and forward within this town. We also meet four other characters that seem to have very little to do with the plot other than to show the obscurity of this town. We have a Sheriff (Powers Boothe), a young couple (Claire Danes and Joaquin Phoenix), him always wanting a fight and her willing to run away with any man possible, and we are also given a blind tramp (Jon Voight) with plenty of wisdom to go around. All of these are just potential obstacles or aids and have very little usage. A debt collector comes into town at one point, on a mission to catch Bobby, but within thirty seconds he is arrested. No tension with him then as he is removed far too quickly.We find ourselves re-treading old ground as this film goes on. Each twenty minute segment just seems to repeat itself up until the strange climax. We are just shown how unlucky one man can be, and how strange this little town seems to be.The stars aren't bad with Penn giving a decent performance, I'm sure this wasn't a tough role for him. Lopez is typically her, not great and Nolte is just gruff. The star is perhaps Thornton in his unrecognizable role, it is definitely against type cast and I was fairly impressed with him. The direction isn't bad but the setting is very typical and something we've seen all too often. I was impressed with the editing and felt that there was a trippy feel to the entire film. Several camera movements and points of view shoots were stitched together well and gave a great feel to the movie. That still doesn't make it a good movie though.I was never really engaged with this film. Not once was I hooked and desperate to know what's going to happen next, in fact I didn't really care. The ending was poor and left you with a poor impression of this film. The theme seems to be about being lost and alone and the theme works as the whole way through that was exactly how I felt.2 \/ 5Tolli More reviews at www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com Follow @Tolli04 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 January 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" U Turn is a very strange, weird and unusual film.

I have recently finished watching it and I am really unsure on what to make of it. Urm, is it good? Not really. Is it bad? Not really. I just don't know what to say about it.The story is about Sean Penn's character, Bobby. He is driving through the desert on route to Vegas to pay off a gambling debt. A debt that has already cost him two fingers. Whilst driving, his radiator hose bursts and the closest place to get it fixed is a little town called Superior. He pulls into a typical looking garage for a deserted town such as this, and is greeted by a fat, hillbilly which is Billy Bob Thornton (who is actually pretty good). Bobby leaves the car in the mechanics hands and heads off to get a drink. Whilst walking through the town he meets Grace (Lopez) and an instant sexual attraction takes place. He ends up helping her put up drapes back at her home but when things heat up her husband (Nolte) arrives home and punches Bobby in the nose. Bobby then leaves the house but is tailed by Jake (J Lo's husband) and is offered money to kill his wife as he can't stand her. Bobby is unsure but when his bag of money is stolen in a grocery shop robbery, he realises he needs the money to pay off his debt or lose more of his fingers. However as he is about to kill her she offers him another proposition, kill her husband and steal his stash of cash he keeps under the floor boards. From here on Bobby must contemplate which route to take. He tries the easy option, to leave the town but the mechanics ridiculous charge for a radiator hose leaves Bobby's beloved Mustang in the mechanic's compound until he pays up. Bobby has no choice, but what will he do to get the money.The story does sound quite intriguing but everything just seems to fall in place far too easily. The characters don't force the plot twists, they just seem to randomly happen and Penn is left turning backwards and forward within this town. We also meet four other characters that seem to have very little to do with the plot other than to show the obscurity of this town. We have a Sheriff (Powers Boothe), a young couple (Claire Danes and Joaquin Phoenix), him always wanting a fight and her willing to run away with any man possible, and we are also given a blind tramp (Jon Voight) with plenty of wisdom to go around. All of these are just potential obstacles or aids and have very little usage. A debt collector comes into town at one point, on a mission to catch Bobby, but within thirty seconds he is arrested. No tension with him then as he is removed far too quickly.We find ourselves re-treading old ground as this film goes on. Each twenty minute segment just seems to repeat itself up until the strange climax. We are just shown how unlucky one man can be, and how strange this little town seems to be.The stars aren't bad with Penn giving a decent performance, I'm sure this wasn't a tough role for him. Lopez is typically her, not great and Nolte is just gruff. The star is perhaps Thornton in his unrecognizable role, it is definitely against type cast and I was fairly impressed with him. The direction isn't bad but the setting is very typical and something we've seen all too often. I was impressed with the editing and felt that there was a trippy feel to the entire film. Several camera movements and points of view shoots were stitched together well and gave a great feel to the movie. That still doesn't make it a good movie though.I was never really engaged with this film. Not once was I hooked and desperate to know what's going to happen next, in fact I didn't really care. The ending was poor and left you with a poor impression of this film. The theme seems to be about being lost and alone and the theme works as the whole way through that was exactly how I felt.2 \/ 5Tolli More reviews at www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com Follow @Tolli04 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"25 January 2012","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I remember this as Disney's first breakthrough cartoon, boldly crossing demographics between children & adults. It's a cute, digestible story with some silly laughs for the young'uns, and it's also packed with some subtle, witty, almost suggestive zingers for the grownups.After seeing it again for the first time in 20 years, in glorious 3D no less, I thought I'd give a review on how it has aged over the years.First, let's talk about the 3D. Well I may be easily impressed (considering the last 3D movie I saw was Space Hunter in 1983), but the 3D experience really brought this story to life and made me feel like a kid experiencing something new again. No, it's not quite as dazzling as the modern, computerized 3D films like I saw in the previews. But I don't know if we'd want it that way. The modern upgrades shouldn't upstage the timeless simplicity of this classic work of art, much like we wouldn't necessarily want to hear the old Beatles recordings remixed in bowel-busting, pelvis-pounding 5.1 surround sound. But some tasteful upgrades here & there can effectively liven up the presentation to today's standards. Here we get a nice enhanced depth of vision and a few spectacular moments like in the song Be Our Guest and the ballroom scene. But I still remained immersed in the story instead of thinking wow this is 3D!The material... Given that this is a vintage fairytale, it can feel a little dated and, well, cartoonish. But isn't that the point? The good guys are unquestionably good. The bad guys are unquestionably bad. There is no moral ambiguity, and all personalities and situations are greatly exaggerated to make it clear to the audience. That's the part that may seem dated in light of today's more complex, irresoluble story lines where good blends with evil and the universe isn't always fair. No, Beauty and the Beast is one of the last true fairy tales & about as idealistic as it gets. So be sure to leave your cynicism at the door.The music & performances are first class. Songs are fun & playful, and I can imagine little kids squealing with delight as well as adults cracking big smiles. This film and Aladdin stand out in my mind as being Disney's most entertaining musicals. There's a certain edge to the music that separates it from the old school Rodgers & Hammerstein type of songs and puts it in a new class of songwriting like Danny Elfman's work on Nightmare Before Christmas. Beyond that, it's hard to describe. You just have to hear it.I was shocked to see the theater completely empty except for one couple hiding in the back. I suppose a lot of people are reluctant to pay the heavy price tag for a 3D film that was never intended that way. Make no mistake, I don't think the visuals will blow you away, especially if you already own your own copy of B&tB on DVD or Blu-Ray. But if, like me, the last time you saw the movie was 20 years ago, I think you owe it to yourself to revisit this great flick, and be sure to go for the full presentation. Who says you can never be a child again? For us old timers, 3D gives us the fresh novelty we need to make it happen.

They're speciality was the almost lost art of stop-motion animation, particularly with claymation figures. They enjoyed some success with the amazing Peter Gabriel music video Sledgehammer, that was an eye-popper in its day. But the company really found its feet when novice animator Nick Park joined the studio.It was Park who would put the company on the map, and introduce two of the most endearing animated characters the world would ever see, Wallace & Gromit. The Wallace & Gromit world is a most peculiar one. Wallace is a scatterbrained inventor, always working on the next madcap invention. Gromit is his faithful dog, and much smarter than Wallace ever will be. With his incredibly expressive monobrow, he watches in silent dismay as Wallace's cock-ups get them into the wackiest adventures.Everyone of the Wallace & Gromit shorts has been a delight. So far we've seen the likes of a skiing oven, robotic trousers, a cyber-dog, a cereal killer, and with they're feature film debut, a Were-Rabbit. The films manage a perfect blend of laugh-aloud comedy and smart visual invention. My mouth always waters at the prospect of the next adventure.And A Grand Day Out is where it all began. Wallace and Gromit are lounging they're Bank Holiday away, but Wallace wants to go somewhere exotic. When there's not a piece of cheese in the house, Wallace on an impulse, decides to build a rocket ship, and fly to the Moon, where everybody knows, is a place paved with cheese. When they get there, they have to contend with a ski-obsessed oven\/cooker, who won't leave them in peace.Even in they're debut, Wallace & Gromit and A Grand Day Out is a charming adventure. All of the things we would come to expect about them are plain to see, albeit in a slightly rougher, uncut form. They're characterisations have already been established, with Peter Sallis nailing Wallace's dimwitted inflections. And Aardman's love of nutty contraptions is there too.The film comes with many delightful sight gags packed around every corner. I especially liked the rocket ship's wallpapered interior, and the throwaway sight of a handbrake on the control panel. But the most inspired idea is a coin-operated oven lying neglected on the Moon. I've always been an enormous fan of silent comedy, which is one of the reasons I like Gromit so much as a character. And Park and Aardman create an intriguing character with this oven.Wisely they don't give it a voice of its own (perhaps the budget didn't allow for two voice-over artists?). Instead they just build a character out of incidental details. And its all done in total silence. Like the cooker's daydreams of skiing, giving a parking ticket to Wallace's rocket, gluing the surface of the Moon back together, trying to hit Wallace with a truncheon only for the money to run out mid-swing.Nick Park directs it all with such a light touch that the film breezes by. However, as much as I enjoyed the film, it does have its flaws. A Grand Day Out is probably the weakest of the Wallace & Gromit shorts. The animation is a little rough around the edges, and lacks the pristine sleekness of the subsequent entries. It also falls down in the plot department. All of the other Wallace & Gromit films are driven by far stronger stories. This one is quite thin. For instance, we never learn how the cooker wound up on the Moon in the first place. (You'd almost swear it was something Wallace had dreamt up). The plot, such as it is, is made to take a backseat to the (admittedly funny) visual puns and Wallace & Gromit's effortless double-act.Perhaps A Grand Day Out hasn't aged as well as the other films, but a lot of the things we've come to love about Wallace & Gromit are already in place. One area where it does have the edge is the fact that its the most conceptually ambitious. All of the other films in the series have remained earthbound, and A Grand Day Out is the only one so far to aim for something a little more profound. It touches upon themes that are rarely seen in animation today. If it had the budget accorded to The Curse of the Were-Rabbit then perhaps A Grand Day Out may have become something extraordinary, rather than just an engaging entertainment.To look at it in the harsh light of day, A Grand Day Out is really the prototype. It was The Wrong Trousers that set the style for the series, and struck up the balance between top quality writing, sidesplitting comedy and fabulous animation in all of the right places.
