One of the best comedies of all time, Ferris Bueller is a movie that just stands the test of time. How anyone could not love this film is beyond any of my understanding, Ferris Bueller is my hero among many others. John Hughes is usually remembered more for The Breakfast Club, which is an incredible movie as well, but I think this was his masterpiece. He said in an interview that this was his childhood, getting his wife and best friend and skipping out on school to go down town and just have a good time. If you are a Chicago citizen, you've pulled a Ferris Beuller's day off too, it's like a law here, lol, if you haven't, I pity you. The reason that this movie works is because of it's outrageous story that everyone wants to live, Matthew Broderick, there was no other choice, he is who everyone wants to be Ferris Bueller.Ferris Bueller is a teenager who fakes out his parents on being sick, even though it is his worst performance of being ill, somehow it works and his parents let him stay home. He takes the gorgeous day outside, takes his really sick best friend and his girlfriend and goes into beautiful Chicago for a blast of good times. I'm not kidding fellow Chicagoians, this is the best Chicago movie! Ferris has two problems though, his principal who is sick of being made a fool of and decides to bust Ferris on his fake illness. And his sister Jeanie, who cares more about Ferris's life than her own and just wants to prove that he's faking it.Even though, you have to admit that it's a bit unrealistic that it is broadcast throughout Chicago that Ferris is dying and no one notices that he's singing in the Chicago parade, on a field trip to the Art Institute with an elementary class, getting snootie with a waiter at Chicago's finest restaurant, and catching the Cub's home run ball at Wrigley Field, you just have fun and cannot stop laughing. Plus you have got to love Edward Rooney, the obsessed principal who is actually sicker than Ferris in one way of putting it. He goes through the whole city to find him just so Ferris doesn't make a fool of him, but he fails on all levels because Ferris is just that awesome. The scene between him and Grace when Cameron prank calls to get Ferris' girlfriend out of school is just too hilarious and will have you in stitches. I don't know what else to honestly say other than this movie is the best comedy to watch if you are looking for a great laugh. So sit, back and enjoy because &#x85;life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and take a look around once in a while, you might miss it; my philosophy.

It was in the UK that he filmed such 1930s classics as The 39 Steps, The Man Who Knew Too Much and Sabotage. Among these was another slightly forgotten classic, 1938's The Lady Vanishes. It starts as a cheery lightweight romp, it becomes a suspense-filled mystery, and it ends as an engaging thriller. Most movies nowadays get stuck in a rut and become nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action extravaganza set in a simple plot which serves as the way to get the characters on screen. Hitchcock did something else He cared about the plot, stretched it out and made it elaborately intriguing, and then filled it in with the characters afterwards.There's a mastermind behind this, and it belongs to that big horror master himself. The Lady Vanishes is one of his best early films (and it would be his last British film), a true sign of what was to come in the later years of his life. It was remade in 1979 with Elliot Gould and Cybill Shepherd, but lacked the freshness and striking narrative that the original contains.In Germany, prior to World War II, a young woman travels cross country in a train, with an eccentric woman known as Miss Froy (Dame May Whitty) as a companion. Froy is a short little woman who reeks of naivety and innocence. But perhaps not everything is as plain and simple as it seems--after falling asleep on the train for a short time period, Iris (Margaret Lockwood), the young traveler, awakens to find Miss Froy absent from her seat opposite herself.The worst thing of all is that no one recalls having seen a little old lady aboard the train. Iris looks like a delusional loony, and she even starts to doubt the story herself, when odd clues start to turn up throughout the train. Enlisting the help of Gilbert Redman (Michael Redgrave), a goofy man who is crazy enough to believe Iris' story, the two search in a frantic race before their train meets its arrival and Miss Froy is unloaded--if she's even still on the train.The fundamentals of the story lie in its plot, and also in its characters. They're all lovable, from Gilbert to Caldicott (Naunton Wayne) and Charters (Basil Redford), two traveling men looking to get back to England for a cricket tournament. After the train is stopped towards the end of the film and a band of Germans tries to board the plane, one of the men quips to the other something to the effect of, We'll never be back for the cricket match, now.It's interesting how so many mysteries make so much sense by the end, but you can't for the life of you guess the ending ahead of time. Sometimes this is not the case (I guessed the surprise ending of Identity from the trailer), especially nowadays with each mystery film being a retread of The Sixth Sense. But back in the Hitch days, most every mystery was a complex one that had a totally unexpected climatic ending. Filmed on an extremely low budget, The Lady Vanishes surprisingly boasts some amazing special effects in some areas, at least for the decade the movie was filmed in. One of these is when Gilbert climbs the exterior of the train, and on the opposite tracks another train swooshes by, knocking him backwards. You find this type of low-budget effect nowadays in homemade movies, but then it was quite good.But other scenes are not quite as exquisite. The opening scene post credits, in which the camera swoops down into a small German village, is filmed well but the background and foreground are both models. If you look closely, you can see that the village folk walking along the street aren't actually walking at all--they're miniature figurines! Look for the little toy car that drives by behind the building--stuff like this is classic! But even with a horrible budget Hitchcock manages to control the scene the way he wants. It shows that even with a minimal amount of money he still tried to make everything intriguing and mysterious.And that he did. Not only is The Lady Vanishes one of the best mysteries of all time, it's one of the best films of all time, too. It takes a while to start, but once it does, does it ever! It's low budget, yes, but not nearly as hard to make out as The 39 Steps, one of Hitch's earlier British films. There are a lot of Hitchcock fanatics out there, and they may not have even heard of some of his earlier, lesser known films. Plus, they may be turned off by how hard it is to make out dialogue and scenes. (The Man Who Knew Too Much is notorious for being hard to understand.) And so for interested Hitchcock fans, your journey starts here.Note Towards the end of the film, look for a quick Alfred Hitchcock cameo. He's the man at Victoria Station who walks by with a cigarette.5\/5 stars.- John Ulmer ","genre":null},{"date":"5 November 2003","score":"42 out of 63 people found the following review useful","review":"  Before Alfred Hitchcock struck gold with such well known films as Vertigo and Psycho, he made films in his native country England.

It was in the UK that he filmed such 1930s classics as The 39 Steps, The Man Who Knew Too Much and Sabotage. Among these was another slightly forgotten classic, 1938's The Lady Vanishes. It starts as a cheery lightweight romp, it becomes a suspense-filled mystery, and it ends as an engaging thriller. Most movies nowadays get stuck in a rut and become nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action extravaganza set in a simple plot which serves as the way to get the characters on screen. Hitchcock did something else He cared about the plot, stretched it out and made it elaborately intriguing, and then filled it in with the characters afterwards.There's a mastermind behind this, and it belongs to that big horror master himself. The Lady Vanishes is one of his best early films (and it would be his last British film), a true sign of what was to come in the later years of his life. It was remade in 1979 with Elliot Gould and Cybill Shepherd, but lacked the freshness and striking narrative that the original contains.In Germany, prior to World War II, a young woman travels cross country in a train, with an eccentric woman known as Miss Froy (Dame May Whitty) as a companion. Froy is a short little woman who reeks of naivety and innocence. But perhaps not everything is as plain and simple as it seems--after falling asleep on the train for a short time period, Iris (Margaret Lockwood), the young traveler, awakens to find Miss Froy absent from her seat opposite herself.The worst thing of all is that no one recalls having seen a little old lady aboard the train. Iris looks like a delusional loony, and she even starts to doubt the story herself, when odd clues start to turn up throughout the train. Enlisting the help of Gilbert Redman (Michael Redgrave), a goofy man who is crazy enough to believe Iris' story, the two search in a frantic race before their train meets its arrival and Miss Froy is unloaded--if she's even still on the train.The fundamentals of the story lie in its plot, and also in its characters.

I know a lot of people find him annoying, but I thought he was just so funny. He showed off his talents in Rush Hour. Not only him, but this is the film that is making Jackie Chan into a world wide super star. His stunts are simply incredible. Rush Hour is one of those very fun action\/comedy movies that I'm sure you'll enjoy if you love movies like Lethal Weapon or 48 Hours. The story was just pure entertainment and really kept me on the edge.Lee is a body guard to the Chinese ambassador and is also a close friend, he also is a teacher to his daughter, Soo Yong. The ambassador goes to the United States with his daughter, but she is kidnapped by an evil man of the Chinese Consol. They want 50 million dollars in return, but the ambassador thinks that Lee should be involved, so he sends for him, but the F.B.I. doesn't want him near the case. So they hire L.A.P.D. screw up, James Carter, to babysit him. But together, the fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west, they must learn to work together despite their complete opposite personalities and get the girl back.Rush Hour is a guaranteed classic down the lines somewhere, I'm sure. It's already spawned a sequel and it's been a success. Chris and Jackie are such a great team, I was really impressed with their chemistry. My favorite scene is where Lee plays War by Edwin Starr in Carter's car, and he doesn't know how to say the lyrics correctly, and Carter shows him some moves, it was such a classic scene that brought me down to the floor laughing.

I have to say anyone who can make complex mathematics so damned exciting in a film has to be a genius. The ideas in the film are an excellent blend of dry science fiction and (IMHO) Jewish mythology. *possible spoilers* But I was disappointed that they didn't fully explain why the business folks wanted the divine number so bad that they'd put surveillance on Max and eventually threaten his life. It is implied that it could save the stock market, which appears to be collapsing. But exactly how and why the number will help was not nearly as fleshed out as the reason that the Cabalists wanted it. It would have been interesting to see how the Name of God ties into the NASDAQ (or doesn't). In general the spooky business lady, her overlords, and her motives where very cloudy. But this is mere nit-picking.1540 Personal Note Max's Indian neighbor is *bleep*ing hot!1541 Tangential thoughts about SF films*spoilers* Conclusion I'm going to be picking on this film now and I know it is not the only one guilty of this, but it was the one that broke the proverbial camel's back for me.I'm very tired of anti-science science fiction. I guess it started with the Ancient Greek story of Icarus 3000 years ago (which is talked about in Pi), and Mary Shelly continued it in the 1800s, and everything from Jurassic Park to The Terminator to this movie keep hammering the same nihilistic message into us Being ignorant is better than being aware.I thought this movie would go in a new direction from what Max's mentor was saying about just taking a break. I thought it's message would be happier and healthier like, `Dude, have a beer before you have aneurysm. Then get back to work.' But in the end his mentor attempts to find the Forbidden Fruit of Knowledge and keels over, then Max drills a hole in his skull and makes himself blissfully less smart and the message becomes `Trying is the first step towards madness.'With this kind of constant Chicken-Little-ing it's truly amazing that I have this fancy machine in front of me that let's me write messages about movies on this other machine thousands of miles away that then shows it to the world. Don't they know it will become self-aware and destroy the human race!Now I know a film about a dinosaur park that functions perfectly or a math genius who finds the Name of God with no serious repercussions would be less interesting, but can't there be an in between. The Matrix Reloaded refreshingly kind of gave a nod to this train of thought.Modern SF tends to keep turning to the story of Icarus as a moral base, but how about looking at Plato's `Allegory of the Cave'. Anyway, something to ponder.

The ideas in the film are an excellent blend of dry science fiction and (IMHO) Jewish mythology. *possible spoilers* But I was disappointed that they didn't fully explain why the business folks wanted the divine number so bad that they'd put surveillance on Max and eventually threaten his life. It is implied that it could save the stock market, which appears to be collapsing. But exactly how and why the number will help was not nearly as fleshed out as the reason that the Cabalists wanted it. It would have been interesting to see how the Name of God ties into the NASDAQ (or doesn't). In general the spooky business lady, her overlords, and her motives where very cloudy.

I guess it started with the Ancient Greek story of Icarus 3000 years ago (which is talked about in Pi), and Mary Shelly continued it in the 1800s, and everything from Jurassic Park to The Terminator to this movie keep hammering the same nihilistic message into us Being ignorant is better than being aware.I thought this movie would go in a new direction from what Max's mentor was saying about just taking a break. I thought it's message would be happier and healthier like, `Dude, have a beer before you have aneurysm. Then get back to work.' But in the end his mentor attempts to find the Forbidden Fruit of Knowledge and keels over, then Max drills a hole in his skull and makes himself blissfully less smart and the message becomes `Trying is the first step towards madness.'With this kind of constant Chicken-Little-ing it's truly amazing that I have this fancy machine in front of me that let's me write messages about movies on this other machine thousands of miles away that then shows it to the world. Don't they know it will become self-aware and destroy the human race!Now I know a film about a dinosaur park that functions perfectly or a math genius who finds the Name of God with no serious repercussions would be less interesting, but can't there be an in between. The Matrix Reloaded refreshingly kind of gave a nod to this train of thought.Modern SF tends to keep turning to the story of Icarus as a moral base, but how about looking at Plato's `Allegory of the Cave'. Anyway, something to ponder.

The original movie. The GOOD movie.This time I noticed a lot of the smaller things that make it so beautiful, so amazing, so DIFFERENT from other movies. The plot was simple and complex, it was stylishly shot, and one can never say that they don't enjoy watching SWAT teams get blown away by badasses in trenchcoats.The Oracle, for example. When Neo goes to the oracle, the entire audience knew for a fact that she'd say 'wayhey, you're the one!'. Only she didn't. Suddenly, the audience is caught off guard. They don't know what to think, and they don't know what in HELL will happen next. Neo's situation when Cypher betrays them and the police and agents ambush the building is very unique - Morpheus sacrifices himself because he thinks Neo is the one, but Neo knows he isn't, but he can't save him because the rest of the crew will endanger themselves trying to save him if he tries to go after Morpheus. Convoluted as hell! And a great situation! And then saving Morpheus, God (I maintain that the sequence from when Neo and Trinity walk into the lobby to the helicopter crash is the finest action sequence in the history of filmmaking, and that from Neo and Trinity walking into the lobby to the end of the movie is overall brilliantly done). Truly inspired, all around.Also take Agent Smith. Agent Smith is the coolest movie villain ever, damn it. From the first time we see him we KNOW there's something sinister about him and the other two agents with him. He has such a methodical and well groomed look to him, the glasses, the suit, the huge freaking gun, and don't get me started on his voice. And then we see that he's slowly becoming unglued. An amazing character, through and through, not to mention that the whole 'suit with sunglasses and ear communicator' look is dead cool. In the later versions they've got him as some kind of rogue program or whatever, but I really don't think that works, mainly because I think he works so well as a product of the system, not something that ran away from it.The Matrix isn't my FAVORITE movie (on a recent top 30 movies list I made, The Matrix was at #20) but it is, as the Teen Girl Squad would put it, 'hella tight'. The storyline is smooth and streamlined, and while it is easy enough to understand, it also has loads of levels (mainly just from what the Oracle told Neo and how that shaped how he saved Morpheus). You can watch the Matrix on all kinds of levels - the 'kickin' rad action' level, the 'kickin' rad story' level, the 'kickin' rad philosophy' level... The list goes on. So once the critics are done panning Revolutions, remember that the movies didn't always suck - they were started out with one of the finest most beautifully done accomplishments of all time.

I have read many reviews of this movie that state that it is the summer after high school graduation.  Obviously, these reviewers were not paying attention.  It is the fall, as is evidenced by the sweaters, jackets, fall decorations, pumpkins, the line by Kat that, next week is Thanksgiving, and if one looks closely during the pool scene there is a sign behind Daisy that says Halloween Party October 31.  Although Kat is off to Yale starting in February, Daisy and Jojo are obviously older than Kat and so, for them, it is not the summer (or fall) after high school. While the romance between Tim and Kat seems more shocking to me now than in 1988 (I must be getting old), it nonetheless still seems believable.  The story lines are all very believable, the characters convincing and unaffected. This movie will make you want to be 18 again!
