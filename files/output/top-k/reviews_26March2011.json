Well, for whatever reason unbeknowest to me this didn't happen for Dalton until Living Daylights. Regardless, View To a Kill is a definite disappointment to the 007 series and I disliked it as much as I did Thunderball but that is an entirely different review altogether. Moving on, I have heard it said that Tanya Roberts who played the bond girl in this film couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Well, I seriously have to agree. She was one of the worst bond girls in the entire series of 007. In fairness to Tanya she is (or was) very good looking at the time. As for the other female lead, Grace Jones was labeled by a lot of viewers as being too masculine for her role and I also must agree with that. As for the villain, Christopher Walkin is one of my favorite actors of all time but not even his character could do much to save this film from ultimately being a stinker. Overall, the story is weak and so is the acting even on Roger Moore's part. Seriously.. it looked as if Moore was ready to throw in the towel before completion of this movie. Very seldomly do I agree with so-called professional critics but in the case of View To a Kill I have to make an exception. To be a bit fair, this might entertain viewers on the first watch yet I am very positive most will not want to see it a second time. I've sat through this movie three times and it was twice too many. While it would have been interesting to see what Timothy Dalton might have brought to View To a Kill in terms of Bond's character, I doubt very highly it would have made much difference to the overall production. One positive comment I will make is that View To a Kill has a good theme song by one of the great euro bands of the 80's Duran Duran.

The rest, as they say, is history. Famously said to be Disney's folly prior to release, Snow White has gone on to be one of the company's biggest earners; few, if anyone, can deny it's not the most deserving from Disney's back catalogue of being released every once in a while on different home formats. Very much a landmark movie for being the first full length animated feature, it also deserves its accolades for the high artistic quality that seeps from every frame. The advancements from Steamboat Willie ten years earlier are nothing short of incredible, the richness of the animation is a joy to behold, as the woodland creatures dart about with purpose, or the way the terror comes to life as Snow White runs thru the forest, the depth and clarity dazzles the eyes. Then of course there's the songs, most of which have formed part of pop culture ever since they were first heard. Whistle While You work, Heigh-Ho and Someday My Prince Will Come, each one a standard uplifter on a dreary day. That the film is accessible to all ages obviously helped it gain universal appeal. Yes, very young kids are quite easily spooked by the darker moments that lay within, but around the corner is a treat, most notably in the form of 7 little dwarfs, each one with an identity and character that the young and old can fully embrace. One of the finest quotes I can remember about the dwarfs came from Charlie Chaplin, who straight out insisted that Dopey was one of the greatest comedians of all time, and he's right of course. True enough it has some minor rough edges that time has inflicted upon it. Snow White is voiced by Adriana Caselotti, her voice is very 30s, very shrill and much too childlike for a character meant to be a young woman. Whilst she's not exactly painted in a good light, bit of an air-head is our Snow White, but to do down the film for its social portrayal of women in the late 30s would be churlish in the extreme!Pixar, presently, keeps raising the bar, as computer-perfection-animation thrills the modern day crowd. But make no bones about it, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is still the benchmark animation movie.

The movie starts with everyday's life, and ordinary hard working people's problems. Robert was compromised to be with a good girl that wasn't filling any void inside of him though. It wasn't her fault since Rayette was a lovely character, not so bright or educated but kind hearted, in contrast with Robert who had serious issues.When things went wrong with his friend, he also learned about his dad being seriously ill. He tried to hold back his girlfriend from following him, and that's the first key point of the movie. She came along with him and during the trip they gave a lift to two weird women.The second key point was the words of one of the women, about dirt and filth. If you will forget those words, you might get disappointed by the ending of the movie. If you keep that in mind, everything goes normally.For a second time he avoids taking Rayette with him. Maybe because he knew that the root of all of his problems was lying there. Seems like Robert disrespects women, but he honestly knows who is wrong and who isn't. Its his fault. He finally arrives at the house. He sees his father, the father, after two strokes is almost 100% numb, unable to speak. He can only move some muscles on his face and not always. Robert's reaction, when he saw his father assured me about lots of things.He was in a house, extremely disciplined, obsessed with music. It was the boring prison of his pressing and submissive father, his father made him lose the music inside him, because music shouldn't become a jail of discipline and high hopes of somebody else. We can also see that, when Robert speaks about anything but classical music and his brother tries to protect his wife from this bad affection. And it was the only enjoyable moment in the house. His brother was full of sarcasm, like Robert was the black sheep of the family. His brother's wife also asked him how he was bored when he was a child. She was doing lots of things and she was there for about two months. When he answered that he was doing nothing (because of his submissive dad) it was a revelation about what Robert was. He made sex with his brother's wife, in order to set her free, he liked her. She was filling the void, but she didn't wanted him, because she could see through. He had no love, as she said, for anyone or anything. He had no music inside him.While leaving with Rayette to head back to their ordinary life, which he hated because it was also a bad routine for him, he stopped at a gas station, went to restrooms, and took a look at himself. Before that Rayette was singing, trying to cheer him up. He had no music inside him. He treated her badly once again.He realised what was the problem. What he was hating most could be himself, for making things wrong wherever he was going. He left her and everything else to start a new life or maybe to isolate himself. He realised that he was keeping his father inside him for so many years, that he was mentally damaged. A very well directed film, an interesting drama. The movie was incredible i guess since it was released at 1970. Well directed, nice actors and if you have ever freely played an instrument, the movie can touch you deeper.

Basically it continues where the previous film left off, where Rocky Balboa (Stallone) defeated Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) by knockout, falling over and winning getting up, by one second, and he is still enjoying his success. Three years have passed, he has had ten fights holding onto his world champion title, and he is now rich with everything he could ever want. After a charity boxing match against World Wrestling Champion fighter Thunderlips (Hollywood Hulk Hogan) and a commemorative statue in his honour and that of his home town, Rocky announces his retirement. Right at that moment however out of the crowd comes the man who has been watching him with intent to fight him and become the new world champion, up and coming boxing brawler Clubber Lang (Mr. T), and with too much pride he accepts. At first trainer Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) is strict that he should not fight him, because he is a killer, and he confesses the ten fights he got him were easy compared to Clubber, but he does agree eventually to give him more fighting tips. It comes to the match, but before it even starts Rocky and Clubber have backstage bust-up, resulting in Mickey having a heart attack, initially Rocky says he will forfeit, but his trainer urges him to go on. In the end, Rocky was too worried about Mickey to fight as well as he normally would, therefore he is defeated in two rounds and Clubber becomes the new World Champion, and Rocky is upset when he returns to Mickey who dies in front of him. He becomes depressed with the grief and thinking that he is finished, and he has no confidence to have a re-match, but then his former opponent Apollo Creed comes along. He encourages Rocky to go for a re-match, which Clubber Lang accepts, and he starts training him, he should try to forget any rivalry he has with the thug and concentrate more on regaining his title, he needs the eye of the tiger. In the end, Rocky and Clubber return to the ring to have another fight, with wife Adrian (Talia Shire) and Apollo watching in the crowd and by the ring with hope, and against all odds Rocky does win the fight with a fantastic knockout punch, once again becoming Heavyweight Champion of the World. Also starring Burt Young as Paulie, Ian Fried as Rocky Jr. and Al Silvani as Al. Stallone still gives a really likable, Weathers steps up in the ranks becoming his mentor, Shire has her moments, as does Penguin actor Meredith before his character dies, and Mr. T is a great opponent with an attitude, a great attribute that got him the part of B.A. Baracus in The A-Team. I don't think the critics are very fair about this third film in the series, the fight sequences are still gripping, the montage sequence or two with the great music is still enjoyable, and of course the Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated song Eye of the Tiger by Survivor, that went to number one, is a great song, a good boxing drama.

After a charity boxing match against World Wrestling Champion fighter Thunderlips (Hollywood Hulk Hogan) and a commemorative statue in his honour and that of his home town, Rocky announces his retirement. Right at that moment however out of the crowd comes the man who has been watching him with intent to fight him and become the new world champion, up and coming boxing brawler Clubber Lang (Mr. T), and with too much pride he accepts. At first trainer Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) is strict that he should not fight him, because he is a killer, and he confesses the ten fights he got him were easy compared to Clubber, but he does agree eventually to give him more fighting tips. It comes to the match, but before it even starts Rocky and Clubber have backstage bust-up, resulting in Mickey having a heart attack, initially Rocky says he will forfeit, but his trainer urges him to go on. In the end, Rocky was too worried about Mickey to fight as well as he normally would, therefore he is defeated in two rounds and Clubber becomes the new World Champion, and Rocky is upset when he returns to Mickey who dies in front of him. He becomes depressed with the grief and thinking that he is finished, and he has no confidence to have a re-match, but then his former opponent Apollo Creed comes along. He encourages Rocky to go for a re-match, which Clubber Lang accepts, and he starts training him, he should try to forget any rivalry he has with the thug and concentrate more on regaining his title, he needs the eye of the tiger. In the end, Rocky and Clubber return to the ring to have another fight, with wife Adrian (Talia Shire) and Apollo watching in the crowd and by the ring with hope, and against all odds Rocky does win the fight with a fantastic knockout punch, once again becoming Heavyweight Champion of the World. Also starring Burt Young as Paulie, Ian Fried as Rocky Jr. and Al Silvani as Al. Stallone still gives a really likable, Weathers steps up in the ranks becoming his mentor, Shire has her moments, as does Penguin actor Meredith before his character dies, and Mr. T is a great opponent with an attitude, a great attribute that got him the part of B.A. Baracus in The A-Team. I don't think the critics are very fair about this third film in the series, the fight sequences are still gripping, the montage sequence or two with the great music is still enjoyable, and of course the Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated song Eye of the Tiger by Survivor, that went to number one, is a great song, a good boxing drama. Rocky Balboa was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, Yo, Adrian. was number 80 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes. Worth watching!

Basically the story continues where it left off, it seems that Rocky Balboa (Stallone) lost to World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) by a split decision made by the judges, and they both get treated for their injuries in the same hospital. Because he made so much money from the fight, Rocky gets married to Adrian (Talia Shire), buys an expensive sports car and a large new home, and starts filming some commercials to boost his fame a bit more, but failing to remember lines stops this happening. Embarraseed he starts working in a meat packing company along with Adrian's brother Paulie (Burt Young), while she goes back to her job in the pet store, while pregnant. He soon gets laid off and thinks he no longer has a future in boxing, announcing his apparent retirement, and starting a menial job helping his old trainer Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) in his gym. Soon enough though Apollo sick and tired of taunts claiming that he didn't win fairly and that the fight was fixed is demanding a rematch to prove he is still the champion boxer to his opponent. Adrian is against Rocky going back in the ring, not just because he said he would stop, but because he gained an eye infection that doctors advised would get worse if he gets hit, damaging his eyesight, but fighting is all he can do. Lack of support from his wife affects Rocky, but he carries on, until after giving birth to their baby son Rocky Jr. when she falls into a coma, he stops training to stay by her side until she wakes. When she does wake, there is only one thing she wants her husband to do, win the fight against Apollo, and so continues the training, until it finally comes to the deciding match which he is determined to win this time. In the end, Adrian watching on TV while still recovering, and Mickey by his side to advise him, the fight begins and it seems he has got his spark back, he wins by knockout when they both fall, and he gets up a second before Apollo, becoming the new heavyweight champion of the world, and getting the gold belt. Also starring Tony Burton as Apollo's trainer Duke, Joe Spinell as Tony Gazzo, Sylvia Meals as Mary Anne Creed and Frank McRae as Meat Foreman. I should be saying that I assumed Rocky lost all his fights in the films, although saying that it explains a spoof I saw of Stallone on Bo! in the USA wore red gloves and a gold belt, so it was a good surprise for me. Anyway, Stallone still gives a credible performance, Shire is still good as his quite quiet wife, and Meredith is still fantastic with his Penguin style snarling or quacking and temper, there is another great montage with catchy music, and the fighting is gripping, the home life stuff's alright too, a worthwhile boxing drama sequel.

Wow, am I happy I did. This was a truly fantastic sci-fi thriller, with intense action and a truly engaging story. The characters were very well constructed and had a lot of substance to them, and of course the acting was superb. Who knew Ralph Finnes could play such a good lowlife?Set in an alternate (but totally recognizable) Los Angeles of 1999, the world has seemingly gone completely to hell, due to rampant poverty and class\/racial tensions which are pushing society towards an all-out state of anarchy. The authorities are barely maintaining order, despite resorting to draconian measures to try and keep things in check. The director does an excellent job of painting this picture for us through fantastic environment and background shots which effectively build the tension and make us fully believe what is happening. In this world, they have invented a type of virtual reality which allows an individual to record everything they are seeing and feeling directly through their brain, so as to then be played back later through someone else's brain, which allows the user to then see and feel exactly what was recorded without any danger (other than possible addiction). So needless to say a huge black market has sprung up to provide people with recordings of all kinds of illicit, criminal and sexual activities that they'd never actually get to experience in the real world. The plot of the movie builds from this technology.However, other than this particular device and general state of social affairs, the alternate 1999 is pretty much identical to our 1999 (very much to it's credit). No flying cars, no wacky fashion, no aliens, no laser guns or anything like that. It was a great decision by the filmmakers to not bite off more than they could chew in that regard, as it would have distracted from a very solid story.The films weaknesses are few, but are there nonetheless. It was a bit long... although I'm not usually one to complain about that kind of thing, so long as the time is necessary to tell the story. In this case an argument can be made either way, though I personally feel they could have lost about fifteen minutes or so (but to me it's a minor issue).The director also felt the need to very quickly explain the origin of the virtual reality technology through a throwaway line of dialog, which really added nothing to the plot, and honestly made no sense; they said the technology was originally developed for the FBI so that informants wouldn't have to wear a wire, which is just dumb. The device is WAY more cumbersome and easily discoverable than a wire transmitter. How about saying that the military invented it to train soldiers more realistically? Or just leave it alone... true virtual reality is a technological holy grail. I don't think anyone questions why something like that would be invented in the first place, even if it's purely for entertainment.Additionally, in my opinion, a couple of the 'bad guys' could have had their motivations fleshed out a tad better, but that is a also very minor quibble. Beyond that, the look of the movie is quite dated, which could hinder the enjoyment for some people. The 1990's did not age very well to our eyes, and this movie is VERY much a product of that era. If you lived through it, you know what I mean. Younger viewers may not fully get the social and cultural allusions that this movie is built upon (Rodney King riots, 90's hip hop culture, rave clubs... things like that)... just something to keep in mind, although if you did live though it, you'll appreciate the depth that these references add.But really, I can't recommend this film highly enough.

Ramsay has three roles and is awful in all of them, Valentina Vargas is supposed to be sexy and evil but doesn't have the talent to convince as either (which is a great shame as she has a large part in the movie), Adam Scott has a small role that I'm sure he doesn't bring up in party conversations and Kim Myers . . . . . well, she actually does a lot better here than she did in Freddy's Revenge. Thankfully, Doug Bradley is as excellent as ever in his Pinhead incarnation and his scenes bring the movie back up to an acceptable level.It's a shame to read up on the background of the movie and to consider what WASN'T filmed but many movies are compromised and changed from their inception - this is a step up from many other Alan Smithee movies, as damning faint praise as that is.

Ramsay has three roles and is awful in all of them, Valentina Vargas is supposed to be sexy and evil but doesn't have the talent to convince as either (which is a great shame as she has a large part in the movie), Adam Scott has a small role that I'm sure he doesn't bring up in party conversations and Kim Myers . . . . . well, she actually does a lot better here than she did in Freddy's Revenge. Thankfully, Doug Bradley is as excellent as ever in his Pinhead incarnation and his scenes bring the movie back up to an acceptable level.It's a shame to read up on the background of the movie and to consider what WASN'T filmed but many movies are compromised and changed from their inception - this is a step up from many other Alan Smithee movies, as damning faint praise as that is.

I guess, it looks awful, Look, it's Shao Khan... oh, man, he's so lame.Do yourself a favor, and avoid this train wreck at all costs.
