Not to mention predictable?Picture this. Its 1962, and in wide screen, stark black-and-white, we have an ageing Bette Davis - or better yet Lana Turner - acting out some potboiler about counterfeit artists and murder and mistaken identities. For preference there are two Lanas, one good and one bad. Its a little hard to tell them apart but that's not the point. When good Lana knocks off bad Lana and assumes her identity, pausing only long enough to bump off anyone who's caught wind of the deception (or seems likely to)we're in tacky movie heaven. Add to the broth Saul Bass credits, lots and lots of glam outfits and some Continental scenery and what you have may not be art but its pretty darned watchable.Now, substitute Matt Damon and Jude Law for Lana Marks I and II. Put it in colour, because the sixties are over, sloooooooow down the Saul Bass credits and throw in Gwyneth Paltrow - who would have been Sandra Dee in the earlier version - and you pretty much have The Talented Mr. Ripley.You can be very boring snips Jude Law to Matt Damon at the point where this movie, after reels of padding, finally kicks into gear. He should talk. Law never really does more than scratch the surface of a woefully underwritten part. In the best Lana Turner tradition the character of Dickie is mostly defined by his wardrobe. We know he's a swinger because he wears cool clothes, a stupid hat and he doesn't bother to co-ordinate his colours. And he listens to Chet Baker. Otherwise what we know of his character we know because all the other characters have told us.And told us and told us! My these people can talk, and exclusively (and endlessly) about each other. Damon is admittedly twenty times the actor than Lana Turner ever was, but he completely lacks the one thing that stars of that calibre could bring to the part - charisma. Which is what it badly needs. Cate Blanchett is on hand to look dorky and to blow the cover in the most predictable denoument imaginable.And that leaves Gwyneth Paltrow, shedding enough tears to flood the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, as the angst ridden girlfriend. Boy she's annoying!Not that this is a bad film. Well it is, but in the time honoured overblown melodramatic style that have made actors and producers rich for years. Its a potboiler, and an entertaining one. And at its best its tons of fun.

The music in this film is like nothing I have witnessed.  It was constant and unrelenting.  I began wondering whether the producers were trying to sell Jet Li or the soundtrack.  It becomes irritating when you want to hear what the characters are saying, but can't because the soundtrack is just booming over the actors.It's a shame the soundtrack is so loud because there are some very talented actors in the film.  Delroy Lindo, Isaiah Washington, and surprisingly Aaliyah, all give good performances, even if the characters are under developed.However, the most disappointing thing is that Li's character (the main character may I remind you) is the most underwritten and one dimensional in the film.  This is unfortunate because Li is a fine actor and has a good screen presence, although his English is something to be desired.  Not only that, Li and Aaliyah had virtually no chemistry together.Wait, there's more.  The subplot involving the NFL seems like it was taken from a generic 70s cop show.  As well, the script seems like it is missing some key scenes, and has a lapse in logic.Fights are what put the people come to see.  There are quite a few of them, not to worry.  Unfortunately, the fights are not that entertaining or very good for that matter.  When watching HK films one can admire that Jet Li is actually hanging from those wires, and while being obviously fake, it is more believable than the use of digital effects on the fights in `Romeo Must Die'.  The other problem is that the x-ray shots are not only distracting, but very cartoon-like.Over all it is not a very entertaining film, and should really be avoided.

I'veseen it 6 times in all now, and all I can say is that it justgets better and better for me all the time. If you've seen itonce, watch it again, you'll appreciate it more. If you haven'tseen it, don't judge it off of your first viewing, remember,this was the most highly anticipated film OF ALL TIME andpeople just didn't give it the break or chance that itdeserves.

Carpenter's movie has a story based up on the novel by Campbell, but Carpenter doesn't place the heart of the movie on the conversations between the scientists at the research station, the scientists do fear and focus their thoughts on what it is among them that is killing and why it does so, but Carpenter has cut up and reassembled the story and tells it his own way, and he does this by simple means... that so talks to you.Set on a research station (unclear what research is actually conducted there) surrounded by cold ice, cold snow... all through the movie one sits still, sometimes jumping up or trying to control ones eyes as an unexpected gross effect takes place (no computer animated effects, real - somewhat - cronenberg styled effects, heads falling, dripping of the bodies).

Just to give one example The issue of abortion is one layer of the film, but it's very poorly addressed. It's way over simplified. Even though I'm pro-choice, I would have preferred a much more objective approach to the issue. The film refered to a few slogans that are floating around (incest and 'woman are going to have them anyway so they should at least do it properly'). It gives no thought to the other side of the issue (there are valid points there also). Acting is not really exceptional (except for the old doctor, who play quite well -- IMHO not at an Oscar level, but good anyway). It could have been a much better moview if the story had been ADOPTED in the broad sense (i.e. changed to reflect changes since the creation of the story). I don't think the orphans were portraied correctly, either. I got the impression that kids were happy in the orphanage and did not really want to be adopted (or at least they were neutral). The love story was based on cliches. Yes, as you can guess, I did not like the movie at all. Go to see if if you have nothing better to do and make up your mind. Probably you should wait for the video release (IMHO).

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"28 March 2000","score":"","review":"  Well, I saw this film on opening night and I was not as disappointed as the last reviewer was.  I thought the martial arts scenes were well choreographed, fast paced, and rather inventive.  I mean sure, we've seen the swinging hose thing before (Black Mask anyone?) but it's just so cool every time he does it.  As for his athletic ability, it is adequately showcased here.  The previous reviewers dislike for Isaiah Washington's melodrama is what makes this film so good.  It manages to balance the plot elements like the double crosses (yes, there ARE a few) and the inter-family, interracial love affair with the sizzling action sequences. And besides, what's wrong with adding a little slow motion and a few CGI flames in the background of the final fight scene? What people have to realise is that this is an action-drama, and that there are certain liberties taken with reality in any film, and in particular, any martial arts film.  Bruce Lee had an incredible repertoire of moves, being a Jeet Kun Do master, but I'm sure that there was a little bit of trickery involved in his films (sped up film stock) just as there is a little bit of trickery in Jackie Chan's films and Chow Yun-Fat's.  The storyline is strong, the black gangsters were a little overdeveloped and the Asians a little underdeveloped, but you have to realize that people are there for Aaliyah, Delroy Lindo, DMX, Isaiah Washington, and Jet Li not for Henry O, Russell Wong et al.All in all this movie, in my opinion, deserved seven and a half stars, if not eight for the marvellous choreography, outrageous driving stunt work, cinematography, and body count quotient.  This is the kind of movie that I would buy in an instant, and the soundtrack kicks butt too.

The film is not predictable and never loses its tension. It is also very cruel at times and that's why it made me feel uncomfortable (a rare ability of today's films).
