Coppola really hit the jackpot Puzo's novel and made the most out of it, I mean, many directors get their hands on some great stories and all they can do is mess the whole thing up. However, Coppola stayed true to the original novel, thanks in part to Puzo himself collaborating in the process of the screen writing, but also was able to give the movie his own feel, similar to what he did with Apocalypse Now. Also, visually, Coppola manages to show the 1940's mafia environment in the most stunning, and real, fashion.WARNINGSEVERAL SPOILERS ALL THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE COMMENTThe scene were the Don gets shot really shows what i'm talking about, and obviously the whole wedding at the beggining does the job of putting you in the environment perfectly, also it is a great introduction of all the major players. Also, the whole section were Michael is at Italy, it is downright beautiful, a great contrast to all of the violent stuff that happens in New York, all of this beauty ends with Michael's return to reallity, his wife's death. This then will make Michael the man that he becomes toward the end of the film, and through the other two films in the saga. Another great example of the horror, is the scene with the decapitated horse is a showstopper and illustrates why Coppola is a genius. However, the heart of the film is in the perfomances themselves. Every single one of the characters is played to perfection, even after reading the novel, there is just no other way I can think of Vito Corleone, but by thinking of Brando. He is the Godfather, period. Well, so is Pacino, who shows that this is only the first of his many great performances. What can I say, to of the greatest performances in one film. The rest are not less great, Caan is convicingly stubburn and hotheaded Sonny, Duvall is great as a contrast to Sonny, always being more practical and reasonable (similar to Michael, yet lacks the superior IQ, and the coldheartedness), Cazale portrays the wimpy Fredo as what Fredo really is, whimpy. Diane Keaton plays great as the naive Kay, who in the end will finally realize what she has gotten herself into, but only too late, and all that is left is to accept her fate and learn to live with it. Shire is also very good as a drama queen, but not much else. The rest are just great mafiosi. Finally, to cap it all off, the music is beatiful. It is the trademark of the film, it is so famous that I know people that can recognize the music as the godfather tune, but have yet to see it, hey, even Slash used to play it live. Basically this film is perfect in everyway, ever since I saw it for the first time I compare every film to it, as a measuring stick, and to this day haven't been able to find a better one. This is one of those films that is not good enough to watch once, but to watch as many times as possible, it gets better everytime. After this, all the other films, are just that, other films.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"19 May 2001","score":"","review":"    ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *** 1\/2 out of ****The recent box office success of The Mummy Returns has given me cause to re-examine its predecessor.  Most of the critical response to the sequel has been mixed, with the majority of the critics stating it's weak when compared to the original.  Movie audiences have been far kinder, many stating it's better than the original and some saying it's even better than Raiders of the Lost Ark!  Naturally, I took the time to look back at The Mummy, the film that opened the summer of 1999.The film was by no means the most anticipated blockbuster of the summer. That honor belonged to more hyped up films like Star Wars The Phantom Menace and the Austin Powers sequel, but the box office numbers for The Mummy shocked everyone.  I saw the movie for myself and found myself agreeing with many critics and viewers, the film is by far the most fun I've had in a movie theater in nearly ten years, since I last saw Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade.  The Mummy is a rollicking thrill ride, a blend of action\/adventure\/humor with a nice dash of romance that keeps things moving along at a lightning pace.  Best of all, the characters were memorable and the action sequences were thrilling and exciting.The plot isn't anything that's Oscar worthy, but it does set up a fun premise.  In the times of Ancient Egypt, a priest named Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) was having an affair with the Pharaoh's wife, Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velazquez).  The Pharaoh discovers this matter of infidelity, which forces Imhotep and his lover to kill him.  As punishment, the Pharaoh's guards execute Anck Su Namun, and in despair, Imhotep takes her lifeless body to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, in hopes of restoring her spirit to her body.  In the middle of the process, the Pharaoh's guards interfere, the ritual is left unfinished, and Imhotep and all his priests are killed and mummified.  Imhotep's body, in particular, must be guarded at all times, for an ancient curse has been placed on it and if he is awakened, he could bring the end of the world.The story cuts to the 1920's, with a lovely but ditzy librarian named Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) intrigued by her brother Jonathan's (John Hannah) latest discovery, a key with a map that could lead to Hamunaptra. Unfortunately, the map is burned so they must rely on the man who had been in possession of the key, a former legionaire named Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser).He leads the small group into the desert, with a rivalling team led by a former acquaintance of O'Connell's named Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor), who is leading  a group of Americans.  They reach the lost city at the same time, and while O'Connell's team discovers the mummified body of Imhotep, the Americans retrieve the mysterious Book of the Dead.Evelyn, who is developing romantic feelings towards O'Connell, is interested in the other group's discovery.  She steals the Book of the Dead from them and reads several passages aloud, with horrifying results.  Imhotep is awakened and is on a quest to gain power and revive his lost love, Anck Su Namun.  To accomplish this, he must first kill the men who found the book and sacrifice Evelyn.  It is now up to O'Connell, Jonathan, and a mysterious cult leader named Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) to stop the mummy before his reign of terror spreads over the world.The film's director and writer, Stephen Sommers, must be really well-versed in adventure films.  He knows how to bring out the boyhood sense of fun in nearly every scene, and he never fails to do anything less than make this a rousing thrill ride.  He never does anything particularlyl innovative, but his ability to breathe life into the adventure genre again is refreshing. His emphasis on characters and humor make this a more satisfying experience than most other summer blockbusters.  It's nice to see a movie that has true intentions of entertaining the audience, and not just try to make a quick buck.The action sequences are a partial reason for the movie's success. Sommers tries out something different for every action scene.  There are gunfights, swordfights, tense chase scenes, and a breathtaking sandstorm.  But Sommers wisely doesn't exhaust you with non-stop action.  The real non-stop thrills don't begin until the 1-hour mark.  He does a nice job of building the momentum with adventure, humor, and romance.Speaking of the romance, Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz have an undeniable amount of sizzling chemistry.  They work well together and it would be nice to see them in a film outside of this genre.  Fraser is the perfect choice for the ruggedly handsome hero.  He does a great job for the physical parts and his charisma is just as strong as his acting.  Weisz does end up mostly playing the damsel in distress, but there's great fun in that acknowledgement and she plays her part quite well.  Plus, the fact that she's very cute doesn't hurt matters.  John Hannah as the comic relief is quite hilarious.  Some of the jokes he's given aren't necessarily funny but his delivery is so dead-on, I couldn't help but laugh.The lead trio have the most presence.  The actors playing the villains don't really have much dialogue.  Arnold Vosloo is a menacing physical presence and though he doesn't say much he does ooze with a certain sense of icky creepiness (could be due to those mummy effects).  Patricia Velazquez doesn't do much other wear some skimpy clothing.  As a mummy, she basically shrieks her way through the role.  Once again, it's not as if though these villains really need to be well-defined.Sommers' script isn't anything brilliant by a long shot, but it's a very entertaining and well-spun tale, which is better than what can be said for most big-budget summer films.  The dialogue, though sometimes seemingly corny, actually works perfectly and is often quite hilarious.  The humor, obviously intentional from all standpoints, keeps the movie's pacing tight and adds an extra degree of fun to the whole production.Sommers also injects the film with the right tone and mood.  It's hardly a frightening film, and that's certainly not the point.  He keeps things on a light-hearted, though still tense and thrilling, level.  The movie doesn't take itself very seriously, and as a result it's a movie experience that's all the better for it.  We've already had a horror-related film about a mummy, and it was time for something more cinematically rousing, which is definitely Sommers' intent.The special effects are quite outstanding.  The initial sight of the mummy is obviously far too CGI, but it works within the film's tone.  Having a seriously scary-looking monster would have ruined the slight tongue-in-cheek attitude the movie was going for.  The rest of the visuals are great.  The design of Hamunaptra is convincingly ancient and mystical.  The large wave of locusts and beetles are also a sight to behold, but the film's best effect is the sandstorm, which Sommers films from the perfect angles, giving us a sense of how immense in size and scope it is.The Mummy has obviously had the largest lasting impression of 1999's summer films.  It may not have the money of Phantom Menace or the innovative visuals of The Matrix, but it's a film that is superb because it succeeds in what it promises to do, and that's to thrill and entertain you for a couple of hours, and it has no pretensions about doing so.

The large wave of locusts and beetles are also a sight to behold, but the film's best effect is the sandstorm, which Sommers films from the perfect angles, giving us a sense of how immense in size and scope it is.The Mummy has obviously had the largest lasting impression of 1999's summer films.  It may not have the money of Phantom Menace or the innovative visuals of The Matrix, but it's a film that is superb because it succeeds in what it promises to do, and that's to thrill and entertain you for a couple of hours, and it has no pretensions about doing so.

Let me also state that I have no real problem with generic popcorn munching movies.  Spoilers may be revealed in the course of my review.Dungeons & Dragons is a popcorn-munching movie.  Or at least it is masquerading as one.  What this movie gets wrong that it's peers do not is that it does not really succeed at any level.  The story is unfulfilling, the acting laughable, and the world created was not terribly immersive.  No small nuggets of anything worthwhile save this movie.I will address the whole special-effects issue quickly.  For the film's modest budget, the production values are decent and I never found myself balking too much at any of the actual technical aspects of the effects. None are overly superfluous, and mostly serve the story.Unfortunately, the story is very weak and and the effects don't have much to go on.  Take the Dragons themselves for example.  It seems that the only purpose the script provides them is to pop up when demanded by mages and and fight each other.  All of the main characters in the movie are painted in broad strokes and stereotypes, which is partly expected for this genre. What usually saves stereotyped characters are quality performances.  Sadly, this movie does not provide those either.  It's as if Courtney Solomon (director) sent all the principals to an over-acting class so they could inject the appropriate amount of cheese into their performances.  The usually superb Jeremy Irons gets maniacal in every scene, not so much chewing scenery as gulping it down in obscene chunks.  Damodar, played by Bruce Payne, is almost as bad, delivering painful dialogue like just like you thieves, always taking things that don't belong to you, all the while appearing constipated.  The main heroes are a forgettable bunch of louts who look and act as if they are in a bad high school play.  Thora Birch is entirely too weak as the Empress, talking about how the kingdom of Izmer should be run as if it were a Wal-Mart.  Justin Whalin and Zoe McLellan portray the films main heroes, along with a Jar-Jar wannabe Marlon Wayans. None of them inspire much reason for us to care about them, and the motivations behind many of their actions are not clear.  One of the most ludicrous situations involves Ridley (Whalin) and Marina (McLellan) falling in love.  They spend a few extreme moments together and are suddenly in love?  What?  Why?  Oh, because he's the cute guy and she's the cute girl and the script says so.  But hey, we do have a scene with the main character falling to his knees and shouting NOOOOOOOOO! as his friend is killed. Some of the acting is decent but from characters on screen for so short a time we can hardly calculate it.  Other story and thematic inconsistencies bugged me.  Why, for example, destroy the wand that controls the Red Dragons effectively setting them free, but keep control of the Gold Dragons?  It is virtually pointless to ask these quetions, however, because the filmmakers don't seem to have cared about any of it.  Another quibble is that several scenes seem to be lifted straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars.  Some call this homage, and in a good film I'd be inclined to agree. But this movie only cheapens that which it attempts to pay tribute to.  The biggest insult of the plot comes at the end with a cheesy feel-good wrap-up that betrays and cheapens any dignity the movie may have instilled.I don't deny that the creators of this movie had the best of intentions, but when translating something as fantastical as D&D to film, certain reservations need to be taken.  X-Men showed us it was possible to have a fantasy world grounded in reality.  Please, if you're going to pay homage to a time-honored institution, do more than try to make everything look cool.A few saving graces are the passable score (though a bit of a Jerry Goldsmith ripoff) and great locations mostly in and around Prague.  The props and costumes are mostly well-done, and the film has somewhat of a(albeit inconsistent)  D&D feel to it.  This however, is not enough to overcome the movie's glaring shortcomings.Dungeons & Dragons is a paltry excuse for a movie in and of itself, not to mention an extremely bad interpretation of the classic game.
