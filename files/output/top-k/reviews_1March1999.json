'Working Girl' does not have the same serious depth of 'Mr Smith', but that probably to its advantage, and doesn't quite have the 1939 film's breadth of vision or masterful direction.

Everything in this movie was Oscar worthy except, rather ironically, Kim Basinger. While she turns in a good performance, it certainly wasn't Oscar worthy. As is always the way with Basinger, she was playing the same character she always plays. She was no better here than she was in Batman. If anything her performance in the rather awful Blind Date was more Oscar worthy.That aside this is a gripping movie with more than a few twists along the way. Guy Pearce was the standout for me. He does a fantastic job as Exley, and unless you knew (like I did) you'd have no idea he's Australian. Of course, to single out one actor is rather unfair as everyone is terrific in this movie, even Danny DeVito who I usually find annoying as hell. He is perfect as the sleazy magazine publisher.If you haven't seen this movie, turn off your computer, and head to the video store RIGHT NOW!

Confidential is the best film I've seen in at least the last 2 years. The fact that this movie didn't win best picture at the 1998 Oscars is a crime. Everything in this movie was Oscar worthy except, rather ironically, Kim Basinger. While she turns in a good performance, it certainly wasn't Oscar worthy. As is always the way with Basinger, she was playing the same character she always plays. She was no better here than she was in Batman. If anything her performance in the rather awful Blind Date was more Oscar worthy.That aside this is a gripping movie with more than a few twists along the way. Guy Pearce was the standout for me. He does a fantastic job as Exley, and unless you knew (like I did) you'd have no idea he's Australian. Of course, to single out one actor is rather unfair as everyone is terrific in this movie, even Danny DeVito who I usually find annoying as hell. He is perfect as the sleazy magazine publisher.If you haven't seen this movie, turn off your computer, and head to the video store RIGHT NOW! Don`t walk, RUN, and grab yourself one of the best movies ever made, and for sure the best movie of the last 2 years. As I said above, the fact that Cameron's incubus of a movie won Oscars over this just shows how totally screwed the whole Oscar voting system is. This movie should have beaten... no, CRUSHED AND UTTERLY DESTROYED the opposition.My only regret is I waited this long to see it.

Having recently finished reading the original Ian Fleming novels, which contained a more human, fallible Bond, I longed for the rough edges of the early entries in the series.  The typical formula had begun to grow stale over the years, and Timothy Dalton showed few signs of reviving it in The Living Daylights.  That flim tried to present Bond as a more serious, modern man, but collapsed under the weight of a weak plot and unconvincing villains.In License to Kill, Dalton gets it right with a subdued performance that is far more compelling than Roger Moore in a majority of his films. The lone exception is The Spy Who Loved Me, where his wit and the slapstick humor finally meshed perfectly with the exciting action.  In this film, Bond's personal vendetta against Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi), the ruthless drug lord who threw Felix Leiter to the sharks and murdered his wife, allows for a surprising level of character development.  Dalton comes closest to the Bond of Sean Connery, with his believable persona and more human tone. Connery always was smooth, but didn't have the superhuman silliness of Moore, and especially Pierce Brosnan in the new films.  Timothy Dalton actually resembles the James Bond that Fleming wrote about in his novels. That character was not perfect, could be brutal and didn't always succeed with ease.Robert Davi is the most intriguing Bond villain since Adolfo Celi's Largo in Thunderball.  He manages to maintain a human stature while committing his vicious deeds.  His brutality is heightened by the unusually high level of graphic violence, possibly the most in the series.  Davi wisely keeps the camp to a minimum, and plays it straight as a modern crime lord.  Before he dispatches Leiter to his gruesome fate, Sanchez conveys a mix of charm and menace without reverting to a ridiculous speech. This modern villain is much more believable and a more difficult opponent because he mixes brains with a stern determination to succeed.One weak point of this film is the performance of Talisa Soto.  Although she looks good, Soto is a terrible actress, as witnessed by her awful turns in the laughable Mortal Kombat and its terrible sequel.  She even struggles to carry the obligatory lines like Oh James!  Carey Lowell does much better as the tough, yet beautiful Pam Bouvier.  However, she still fades to the background behind the interesting battle of wills between the two leads. After Bond infiltrates Sanchez's organization, it is interesting to watch him charm the drug lord and gain his trust.  And of course, Sanchez falls prey to what Roger Ebert calls the fallacy of the talking killer.  Instead of simply dispatching Bond to a vile death, he hesitates, and you can guess where his overconfidence leads him.License to Kill may be a departure in some ways from its recent predecessors in tone, but it still contains the trademark incredible action sequences.  A highlight has Bond trying to thwart the underwater transfer of drugs.  In this scene's climax, Bond water skis behind a small plane, then climbs in and overtakes the pilot in mid-air.  The tanker-truck chase in the film's finale is spectacular, one of the best sequences in the series.With the success of the two recent Pierce Brosnan films, the Bond franchise is alive and pumping.  Both of the movies are exciting and well-made, but lack the human elements that make License to Kill such a treat to watch. Although it was largely ignored by the masses and critics, it deserves a serious second look.  With the exception of The Spy Who Loved Me, License to Kill is the best Bond film since Thunderball.

This actually worked well in the first half of the film, as it seemed a refreshing exception to the rule, and since it added to the mystique that clouded the story to begin with. Still, Phantoms is otherwise infested with horror-cliches, and as the story unravels it would have benefitted from being based around characters we actually care for. As for actors, Liev Schreiber and Ben Affleck do well,  but Rose McGowan stinks it up a little. Mainly it's due to bad casting, as she looks like a 25 year old disguised as a kid.

It seems to me that it would be near impossible to make a comedy out of a movie about a hitman, yet George Armitage, John Cusack, and all of the supporting cast pull it off with flying colors. Cusack is one of the few high school movie heart throbs that has held on over the years and developed into a talented artist. He is dynamite in this picture. Minnie Driver, Dan Aykroyd give great performances. John's sister Joan adds a quirkiness to her scenes making them very enjoyable. But Alan Arkin and Jeremy Piven steal every scene they are in as the hitman's therapist and best friend. Bottom line, see this one right away, you will not be disappointed.

Gorman, and to a lesser extent Hudson, Apone, Drake, etc.). The heroes\/victors? 2 adult females (1 survivor), 1 juvenile female, 1 synthetic person and 1 adult male. Hard to get more egalitarian than that.3) Crisp, believable, memorable, quotable script--a rarity and a joy in any film since the lion's share of a major film's budget went, not to the actors, but to the pre- and post-production crew (as well as the crew off-camera during filming).4) Cameron's depth of research and world-building for this (and a few other) films is almost as impressive as John Tolkien's for Middle Earth. Where Ridley Scott sketched out a series of events, James Cameron built a time and place that could have thousands of plausible, interesting stories.5) Cast selection, and subsequent character building, rival and perhaps top (ironically) Ridley Scott's Bladerunner.I echo many of the feelings and opinions other reviewers here have already written, so won't repeat them, except I have never yet seen Aliens and felt that I'd seen it one too many times.
