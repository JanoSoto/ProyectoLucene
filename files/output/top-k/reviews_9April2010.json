As in the first film, the nerds must try to figure out a way to make those pretty people understand them. Considering how much money the first film made I guess it's a little bit shocking that it took them three years to get a sequel made but after viewing this thing it's obvious they didn't take that much time trying to come up with a good screenplay. With very few exceptions sequels are just the first film slightly altered but what really sinks this one is that we get watered down, PG-13 rated jokes that are just poor copies of great jokes from the first film. I've never fully understood why studios think they need to water down jokes to try and bring in a larger audience. Going by the box office numbers it's clear the PG-13 rating wasn't what the film needed. What it did need was a better screenplay because what we get here is pretty lazy as the majority of the jokes fall flat on their face. The problem with many of them is that the characters here are so poorly written that most of the time we just see them acting over-the-top and this really goes against what their characters were in the first movie. The entire idea of them traveling to Florida for some conference is pretty weak story wise and one must wonder why something better wasn't thought of. Robert Carradine returns as Lewis and while the performance is fine you can't help but notice how hard he's having to work to try and make up for the screenplay.

Their relationship was for the most part a very informal one (shockingly so to others, to whom deference to royalty - especially from commoners, and servants to boot! - was the natural state of affairs) and the obvious closeness of their relationship led to rumours and innuendo about the possibility of a love affair between the two. The movie takes no side on whether that happened or not (although the very closing scene, in which two of Victoria's most important counsellors are relieved that Brown's diary was found and that no one else had seen it perhaps implies that something had happened) and the reality is that there's no solid historical evidence to suggest that any romance developed between the two. The movie does portray in a very convincing manner the complications of such a friendship the jealousy felt toward Brown by both his fellow servants (to whom he becomes quite haughty at times, rubbing their noses in his special status) and by other members of the royal family, who feared the potential for scandal and also resented the fact that Brown was closer to Victoria in many ways than they were.The movie is a good period piece. The sets and atmosphere seem authentic and there's some great Scottish scenery in the midst of the story. The movie also features great performances from Judi Dench as Victoria and Billy Connolly as Brown. Also not to be overlooked is a fine performance from Antony Sher as Disraeli - the Prime Minister whose own position as head of government is being threatened by the Queen's increasing unpopularity when she secludes herself for years after Albert's death, and who eventually has to seek Brown's help (because Brown seems to be the only one with influence over her) to get Victoria to reclaim her public role as sovereign.

While most of the sequels feature a Freddy that is more interested in cracking a joke than being an intimidating serial killer, the original film is where he seems to shine brightest. He seems to always be lurking in the shadows making it nearly impossible to get a clear look at his face. Remember when films left a bit of a mystery to things rather than being entirely realistic and showing every little detail when it came to gore? Well, this is a good example.The deaths of Tina and Glen could arguably be reason alone to watch the film. Tina's death is so original and so well done. One of the reasons it still holds up today is because it was done with practical effects. The same can be said about Glen's death. The only thing more impressive than his death is the fact that it's Johnny Depp's debut. Both deaths are two of the most memorable in horror film history.Despite A Nightmare on Elm Street being one of the most influential horror films of our time, it still has that cheesiness associated with most horror films that come out of the eighties. Bad acting (Heather Langenkamp especially. The Screw your pass! scene is a good example, but is hilarious in its own right) and dated special effects being the best examples. While the practical effects are a good thing and are much preferred over CGI, some of them haven't aged well over the past 26 years. The chase scene of Freddy chasing Tina is probably the best example of this.

The only part of this film I could remember was mysteriously the end, where you find out that Harrison Ford's character is actually the culprit, and that lead me to believe, many years later, that this was my forgotten viewing masterpiece. I had a choice of watching it again or not but my choice was pretty obvious and considering my praise for this particular film, I went out and bought myself a brand new copy. The beginning scene where Claire's daughter is going away to college, I was already impressed. I hated those sex-crazed teens that always ruin the movie and have to pay for it at the end. The cut on her was very wise and it made the film that much better. Look at me ranting on about a b*tch I don't even know of. Harrison Ford plays a medical doctor who goes by the name of Norman Spencer and he actually knows more than he is hiding about the case his wife is investigating. The twist at the end was so unexpected and shocking and that twist made the film for what it is, and that is a decent thriller\/drama. Harrison Ford plays his role convincingly and strongly which makes him the best out of the whole film. Michelle Pfeiffer on the other hand is quite hateable because her acting isn't even worth a dime. My reason for bulging her eyes out is not a good one but it is her fault not mine. James Remar, who plays Warren Feur, did a good job of being accused for killing his wife and it really added more mystery to the film as well. He is a light side to this thriller mystery by being funny. The director should have included him more. The scene at the party was laugh out loud funny as Warren teases Claire. The story is great but is painfully slow all at the same time. I was really disappointed at that and I was expecting something fast-paced. There were hardly any scares in this film and when a scary face popped up it did not make me scream even for a second. The seance scene was, to be honest, quite scary and funny at the same time all thanks to Diana Scarwid.Norman Spencer, a university research scientist, is growing more and more concerned about his wife, Claire, a retired concert cellist who a year ago was involved in a serious auto accident, and who has just sent off her daughter Caitlin (Norman's stepdaughter) to college. Now, Claire reports hearing voices and witnessing eerie occurrences in and around their lakeside Vermont home, including seeing the face of a young woman reflected in water. An increasingly frightened Claire thinks the phenomena have something to do with the couple living next door, especially since the wife has disappeared without apparent explanation. At her husband's urging, Claire starts to see a therapist; she tells him she thinks the house is being haunted by a ghost. His advice? Try to make contact. Enlisting the help of her best friend, Jody, and a ouija board, Claire seeks to find out the truth of What Lies Beneath.The film definitely has to be something you have to watch out for but in some cases it didn't work for me. The slow story and the cheap scares really made me sick. The cons were slow story, bad acting from Michelle Pfeiffer, cheap scares. Pros were Harrison Ford's acting, James Remar, Diana Scarwid, and the priceless twist at the end. I recommend this over Hide and Seek at any time.

It was ran by a man named Steve Rubell and he was somewhat of a god in that world. Everyone wanted to be his friend, and he just wanted money, sex and drugs. He was embezzling money from his own company and not letting the IRS find out about it, but when word got out his place was shut down quickly and he went to jail.Ryan Phillippe plays Shane, a character based on Tieg Thomas, a bi-sexual party boy who became a bartender and a star because of his time at 54. Shane however was straight and fell in love with a soap star on this movie and he and the girl he falls for have to realize that life and love is more important than selling yourself out.Side note...there is another director's cut of this film out there based more on Tieg's life having lots more sex and bisexual encounters, director Mark Christopher may release it anytime, he got lots of clearance for the DVD release, but there's still lots more to be seen on DVD.Mark did a really great job directing this movie film and with all the lights and action going on in the club he captured the right things at the right times, his use of slow motion is perfect. He is mostly famous for doing gay cinema and shorts like those seen on the Boys Life series, and his work here far outshines those.Acting wise this was a gem. Ryan Phillippe is a good guy, I have met him and he's such a great guy in person that I could never judge him on film, but I will say he did a great job and thats not biased, he's nothing at all like the cocky Shane character he played here and he did good with the Jersey accent. Mike Myers may have did his best acting job ever here, we've all seen him do these crazy characters such as Austin Powers but here he's playing a real person and this movie is not at all comedy and he pulls off a serious acting job, it is so hard to believe this is Mike Myers. Neve Cambell also did her best work here in my opinion, early in her career but trying to play an older more sophisticated Jersey girl in the New York circle. Other great actors included Breckin Meyer, Heather Matarazzo, Ellen Dow and Sela Ward. Salma Hayak was the balance though, that girl cant act in a movie unless Robert Rodriquez is directing her.Of course disco was the music of this time, and I thought the music here was very fitting, the songs were as important as anything when one of your stars is the club and the dance floor. Nice original music too, and glad to see a Bachman-Turner Overdrive thrown in the mix.Great movie I recommend it to drama lovers, bio-pic lovers, disco lovers and just anyone looking for a way to kill an afternoon enjoying a film. 6 out of 10 stars.

The setting is fairly simple, a business man gets bitten by a wolf, who slowly changes into a werewolf, and along the way starts a romance relationship with his boss's daughter. Aside from fighting his wolf side taking over, he also has to juggle his business career and stop an employee form taking over. Wolf had never been in my interest but nowadays I like to watch werewolf movies and so I, Indiana Wolf, started an adventure for watching as much werewolf theme movies as I could. And years later, my search brought me to Wolf. The film is not what a action fan would expect because it is more story-driven rather than action-driven. I am grateful to watch a decent Werewolf film without stuff blowing up every second, so my warning to action fans is Don't expect a Wolfman to pop right in your face!. The acting from Jack Nicholson is fairly exceptional and, in my opinion, he was the best actor in the whole film. Michelle Pfeiffer didn't satisfy me mainly since her role was such a big, fat cliché. She sucked more crap than James Spader did in this film. In relation to James Spader, he is a one of those guys who you love to hate in films, with the exception of Stargate, and this film has proved nothing but just that. The only reason I can stand him is because I know that he will eventually die for his shitty acting at the end of the film. The special effects are very unrealistic ad it is hardly used very often but when it is used, like the scenes where Jack Nicholson's character slowly changes into a werewolf or the part where he fights James Spader's character at the end of the film, the result is pretty unconvincing. The fights aren't choreographed properly because it looks like they are just jumping around biting the air. The ending was alright as well but I hated it when Pfeiffer's character revealed herself as the new werewolf, I absolutely hated it. The powers that the wolf-bitten get are quite amusing and fun to watch. Worn down and out of luck, aging publisher Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) is at the end of his rope when a younger co-worker snatches both his job and wife out from under his nose. But after being bit by a wolf, Will suddenly finds himself energized, more competitive than ever, and possessed with amazingly heightened senses. Meanwhile, the beautiful daughter of his shrewd boss begins to fall for him - without realizing that the man she's begun to love is gradually turning into the creature by which he was bit.My two favorite scenes were the part where Laura Alden meets and finds out that Stewart Swinton is also a werewolf after being bitten by Will Randal.

It was he and people like him that proved to the audience that film-making is not merely a gallimaufry of the various forms of entertainment, but art. Film-making is art inside as well as out. And Kurosawa's dark and brilliant 1980 film Kagemusha qualifies without fault. Though the art is more apparent on the outside, there is plenty of it inside as well.Kagemusha translates in English as Shadow Warrior the alias given to the unnamed protagonist of the film. The Kagemusha is a condemned bandit who is saved from the gallows when the brother of daimyo Takeda Shingen discovers that he bears a striking resemblance to the bloodthirsty dictator. The bandit is promised freedom if he impersonates the war-mongering lord for three years in order to confuse his enemies. However, when the real Shingen is shot and killed by a sharpshooter, the Kagemusha is forced to take all responsibilities of the lifestyle of the lord such as commanding his armies, outwitting his enemies, and serving as a father-figure to his grandson.The Kagemusha is played by veteran actor Tatsuya Nakadai, whom fought against Toshiro Mifune in both Yojimbo and Sanjuro and would later work on Akira Kurosawa's highly acclaimed 1985 film Ran. He also plays the real Takeda Shinge in the opening portion of the film and Nakadai is utterly brilliant in the way he switches between both roles even though these two men are, in a way, identical. It's the way Nakadai acts that we can sense a character difference between the two. An enormous deal of credit is also due to the writers (one of whom is director Kurosawa) who made the brilliant decision of never revealing the actual name of the Kagemusha. And strangely enough, because the writing is so good and Nakadai's acting is so pure, though we don't know the man's name, we can identify and sympathize with him, which is exactly what we do in the last third of the movie. The most brilliant element of the film's human level is the way Nakadai bonds with the grandson of the man whom he is impersonating and the way he discovers that he is not only a better father figure, but a better person, than the actual ruler.Regardless of your opinion on the movie, there is one thing everybody agrees on there is beauty painted all over the screen. There's not a badly-lit or badly-composed frame in the entire film. We get a surreal, array-flooded nightmare sequence, gorgeous landscape shots, majestic views of the ocean, and much more. Kurosawa always storyboarded his films using painting as opposed to sketches and here he just let loose an array of passion and colors that undoubtedly mirror what he did while trying to sell the story to distributors. Like he would do with Ran, although not quite to the same extent, Kurosawa graphically re-enacts violence with an artistic, but harrowing nature that is completely foreign to the glorified, stimulating duels of Yojimbo. Blood is let loose in torrents throughout the film, but Kurosawa does not overdo it to the point where it might condescend into some kind of an unintentional comedy. The climax of the movie, a recreation of the 1575 Battle of Nagashino brilliantly generates a reaction from the audience and the famous four-minute montage of death and suffering that follows is truly gripping. Like the final showdown of Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly very little happens and this may sound like a premise for an overdrawn sequence, but every second of it is overwhelmingly strong. Perhaps the reason why Akira Kurosawa had such a difficult time getting backers was because he wanted absolute control over his films. Well, he hardly got support and in this case he needed financial assistance from Western admirers George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, but when he did have the money and the control, Kurosawa was relentlessly brilliant.The running time of Kagemusha will question the full extent of its audience as will the scenes where very little happens for a while, but for those who appreciate a good movie and have three hours to spare, this is a tremendously enthralling experience. Kagemusha boasts a lot of exterior display, but unlike a great many other movies that have the same accolade of looking good, Kurosawa's movie shows beauty beneath as well, on the human level, encompassing the audience with a heck of a story. It had me drawn in right from the very beginning.

Love him in his Oscar-winning role in SCENT OF A WOMAN (1992); it's not as overrated as people say and he is infectiously good in that. But in CARLITO'S WAY, Mr. Pacino plays the more difficult role of Carlito Brigante, who deserves as much respect as Michael Corleone or Tony Montana! I've got to preface the rest of my review by saying that I've seen this film a bunch of times, starting with right after it first came out in the early 90s and have loved it ever since. It is one of those films that has EVERYTHING in it that will appeal to anyone. You like Action? CHECK...Romance? CHECK...Drama? CHECK...Thrills? CHECK...Humor? CHECK...This is one of the rare films that has it all!The legendary Pacino seemed to specialize in playing ambitious, crafty, respected gangsters and Carlito is no exception in those general aspects; but in this film, Carlito is in large parts different from both Corleone or Montana; whereas both Corleone and Montana were very powerful men that controlled empire throughout the bulk of their films, Carlito WAS a powerful gangster who lost his empire and did jail time; also, Corleone and Montana were inherently suspicious and possessive men to the point of being paranoid, and dare I say it, inherently evil; whereas Carlito was justifiably suspicious, but also ironically forgiving and accepting of other people's shortcomings and at his core, a GOOD man! The other 2 men chose to live a certain way and either never tried to redeem himself (Corleone) or never had a chance (Montana), but Carlito has lived the hard, gangster lifestyle, paid for his sins, and now wants redemption and to start anew. From the moment the film starts in 1975 with his courtroom speech (the only pure comic moment in the film) thanking the judge for releasing him early from his 30-year prison sentence (he only served 5 years) to the very end, the viewer HAS to root for Carlito Brigante! Carlito, upon release, wants to start a whole knew life and become legitimate. No more drug-dealing, no more killings. He wants to play it straight. Carlito's lawyer that gets him off is Dave Kleinfeld (played by the great Sean Penn in a superb performance), a shady man who is hooked on drugs and has his own troubles as he has stolen money from one of his other imprisoned gangster clients, who finds out about it and blackmails Kleinfeld into helping break him out of prison. This is definitely one of my favorite Sean Penn performances and ironically in a supporting role. He's effortless as this scuzzy, posing, pathetic, out-of-his-league lawyer and in a way, his tale is as tragic as Carlito's.The film's first ironic moment occurs when Carlito's young cousin gets him into a scrape with some low-level drug dealers in a crappy gin-joint\/pool hall, where Carlito must use his old school cunning and instincts to survive. His cousin had $30,000 to make the deal for the drugs, but the dealers were going to kill him and keep the drugs and money for themselves. Carlito can't save his inexperienced cousin, but outsmarts the dealers and gets away with the money. He uses that money to buy into a partnership with disco-owner Sasso. At this point, he sees a dancer one night that reminds him of his old girlfriend Gail (Penelope Ann Miller in a sexy, sweet performance). He seeks out Gail one night after her dance class and they go to a diner to talk about their past and possible future. Honestly, I think that beauty is an overrated word and there are even actresses that are (supposedly) beautiful in real life that don't do it for me on screen, but Miller as Gail totally does it for me! Gail is a REAL woman, who, like Carlito has goals, ambitions, desires and they complement each other perfectly. Gail is sexy in a very natural way.Things look good for Carlito, but feeling he must help Dave out of his scrape, he goes along with him the night of the prison escape on a boat with the gangster's son and Dave kills the son against Carlito's wishes. Carlito cleans his hands of Dave. But there is another up and coming gangster Benny Blanco (John Leguiziamo in a wonderful performance) that has an unhealthy admiration for Carlito and won't leave him alone. So Carlito finds himself surrounded by all these shady types that he can't shake. He decides to run away with Gail, who is pregnant.Directed by the great Brian DePalma, CARLITO'S WAY is a very authentic period piece as he captures the essence of the 1970s without the film bogging itself down in that time period. The focus is on the characters and the story, but has an epic feel with a lot of long-view tracking shots, an operatic score, and Pacino's brilliant narration of his characters thoughts and emotions. The cinematography is amongst the best I've ever seen in a modern film. All these elements perfectly complement the bombastic personality, yet contemplative nature of Carlito Brigante. I don't know if I've ever seen a film where virtually all non-human elements of the film reminded TOTALLY of it's main character! Another thing...this film is almost 2 and 1\/2 hours long and is NEVER boring! That's an incredible feat in and of itself.Great supporting work is also provided by Luis Guzman (as Carlito's right hand man Pachanga), James Rebhorn (as the D.A. out to nail Kleinfeld), Paul Mazursky (as the judge who freed Carlito), and my favorite one played by Viggo Mortensen (as the wheelchair-bound Lalin, an old associate of Carlito's).But in the end, this film is ALL Mr. Pacino's, who effortlessly essays the title character and gets some of the most quotable dialogue in the gangster genre of film.

One day she recommended we rent this movie because she had already seen it and said it was the best movie she had seen since Gone With The Wind. And so I thought to myself out loud Sounds like two hours of pure torture. Since it was her turn to pick the movie for the night, and that's the kind of wonderful guy I am, we got it. Also, I figured during her favorite movie would be a really cool time to break up. After five minutes I was fascinated by the slow, gentle pace and sparse, effective dialog. Hey, I thought, what gives? She hated Apocalypse Now and fell asleep during FrankenHooker. She had crap taste in movies, but this one was actually kinda good. I was sure the person playing Arnie was actually mentally handicapped but doing a very good acting job. Then I realized that it was all acting, not a retarded actor. Wow, very impressive. And the story just got better and better, all the details and moments contributing to the theme and mood. Nothing was gratuitous, it just kept getting deeper and broader.I just watched it again, and 15 years of aging has only made it better.

I know I have seen it more than 50 times and it never gets old. The film is a heart-wrenching tale of a falsely accused man forced to do a life term in prison due to an ironic twist of fate. Along the way, Andy makes friends amongst his fellow prison mates; as well as some friends in higher places. These friendships greatly influence the plot and outcome of the story. The film has a dark side, too as the brutalities of everyday prison life come to the forefront. Also, the film possesses a lighter side with its portrayal of hope and faith and how those traits can rise out of desperation.

Along the way, Andy makes friends amongst his fellow prison mates; as well as some friends in higher places. These friendships greatly influence the plot and outcome of the story.
