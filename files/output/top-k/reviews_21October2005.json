Thankfully, in Japan they do things differently; in Japan, animation is cool.Akira blew my mind when I saw it at the impressionable age of 15. I wasn't a complete noob, but still I had no idea what I was in for when I popped that crispy VHS tape into my noisy VCR. This movie had everything my teenage fantasies craved; ultra stylized and ultra violent sci-fi action more than a decade before the Matrix with production values that (now) nearly 20 years old still rock. There are scenes in this film drawn with more precision than a computer rendering, that look more alive because of that added human touch.And there's a story to go with it. My animation instructor claimed Akira had nothing more than people yelling at each other in it (he was a little biased tho, having been influenced by only the western animation greats like ... well, none of their names come to mind because I was only influenced by Japanese ones! No wait, Tex Avery, got one! hah!...) Needless to say, I pity him and never did forgive him for his stupidity.This is a masterpiece, something that must be seen. The original Streamline dub is better than the new Panasonic one, even though it is probably less accurate it left more to the imagination. But don't let that or the steep asking price deter you from the new DVD. There's tons of special features, from the Akira production report (30 mins) to 100s of character designs and background paintings to frame through.

The amazing P.T Anderson hit Magnolia captivated me from start to finish. It used the fantastic technique of jigsaw puzzling the plot, and skipping back and forth from each person(s) situations and then merged them at the finish, they were linked in a mad way, and the whole film is quite imaginative and simple to get to grips with. It is miraculous, set off in documentary style, spiralling into a taut drama, turning into fantasy and ending in sheer sadness, with a hint of revelation and happiness at the end as someone in the current state of affairs finds something to smile about... love. The film has a star-studded cast of many good talents, and some who I generally thought were not good enough to hold their own in front of a camera, but they do. And they also support their acting sidekicks with extreme prestige. For instance... Tom Cruise stars as Frank T.J. Mackey, the long lost son of Earl Partridge, his rich dying father who he hates... and unlike his earlier performances (in which he was generally acted off the stage by bigger better actors) Tom actually puts heart into his acting, and proves he has talent. His acting may reflect the tragedies he has faced in his real life, and if so, then it worked because he has definite integrity in this part, and has also a lot of pride to gain from this film. Julianne Moore also shows some acting metal as Partridge's young adulterous and generally uncaring wife, who feels guilty she didn't do better for him as he's dying and she tries to redeem herself by loving him for his last breaths. These two established some mark on the film industry when they starred in this magical film, and support from other actors (who I thought were competent and promising talents before they starred in this) include Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H Macy, John C Reilly, Philip Baker Hall, Melinda Dillon and Jason Robards. P.T Anderson is also superb at the helm, he proved his expertise in Boogie Nights and made an even bigger statement with this, his jigsaw technique and unique shots and storyline make this an absolute gem, with critical acclaim throughout it's distribution range, and with more than enough intrigue to keep me glued for over three hours makes this film a true, all time classic and a memorable film to say the least.

It marked the director as being right up there with fellow Movie Brats of his generation like Steven Spielberg and Brian DePalma. And it also showed his ability to create a hugely suspenseful film on a budget that wouldn't even cover the catering on most mega-budget Hollywood films of today, or for that matter more than a few special effects explosions in the bastardized remake of 2005. By keeping it taut and economical, Carpenter showed what a mere $100,000 could buy in terms of great film-making in 1976.The setting is south Los Angeles during the summer of 1976. Austin Stoker plays an L.A.P.D. lieutenant whose first assignment in his new position is to oversee the closing of an aging police precinct building in time for a new one to open not far away the following day. It at first seems to be a routine matter, even as the precinct accommodates an overnight stay of brutal prisoners being transferred from one jail to another. But it soon turns into something far more dangerous when a father (Martin West) whose young daughter (Kim Richards) has just been killed by gang bangers while getting ice cream from an ice cream vendor seeks shelter after he manages to kill one of the thugs. Shortly after nightfall, local gang members of every type besiege the understaffed police station with every weapon available to them, including silencers. Stoker and the rest of the staff must not only rely on their own expertise, but the ability of the prisoners (including Darwin Joston and Tony Burton), to strike back and beat off the gang bangers.As is often mentioned, ASSAULT was written and directed by Carpenter as an urbanized reworking of director Howard Hawks' 1959 western classic RIO BRAVO (to the point where he also edited the film under the pseudonym of John T. Chance, the name of John Wayne's character in RIO BRAVO). But there's even more to this film than the mere paying homage to another director. The siege itself is structured in a way that is reminiscent, in terms of intensity and psychological horror, of other films as well--THE BIRDS; NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD; STRAW DOGS. Although the dialogue between the prisoners and Stoker and the precinct staff isn't necessarily top notch (something that Carpenter always seemed to have a problem with even after this), this is a mere minor inconvenience, especially as he is able to maintain the tension of this simple story for ninety solid minutes through sharp editing and his own piercing synthesizer-dominated music score, milking his $100,000 budget for all its worth without letting its minuscule technical defficiencies show.ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 was made back in a time when Hollywood still gave audiences credit for having brains, and where a simple and well-made story that relied more on tension was far superior to monstrous explosions and ultra-graphic violence. It might be dated by today's standards, but its ability to keep audiences riveted hasn't wavered too much in the three decades since it was first released.

Just a few of many positive words to describe the amazing 1975 Milos Forman classic, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. a moving and sometimes comic portrayal about the goings on inside an Oregon Mental Institute, with Jack Nicholson leading the star-studded cast to greatness as Randall P McMurphy, the one who flew over the cuckoo nest, and set the whole strict system on fire. Louise Fletcher plays Nurse Ratched. A cold, stark authoritarian keen to preserve the routines and discipline amongst the patients. But... Then Randall turns up, in his rambunctious but apparently sane manner, and the sparks fly. Nurse Ratched tries her best to subdue him into the peaceful, sedated and rather boring existence of the institute, but evidently appears to fail as Randall has plans of his own. Randall is not going to be pushed around by this woman. And he makes a stand, urging the others to take the stand as well, and break the routine, that probably sent them mad in the first place. Nicholson is fantastic and he thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar, and Fletcher deserved her actress' equivalent Oscar too. They react and ignite each others actions so well that they couldn't claim anything less for their very realistic acting talents. Young Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd and even Scatman Crothers turn in good performance that are perceived as quite comical, but I'm not sure if they are meant to be really (I guess it is easy to laugh at the insane because of the general odd things they do, such as when DeVito eats the dice out of the Monopoly game.) Forman directs well, and the mood is exceptional. An aura of enigma surrounds the whole film, because watching it, no matter how many times often proves to be a quite joyful, yet confusing affair. I swear I cannot figure out these characters, they are too profoundly presented.

Three years after the Island's police chief improbably blew up a great white shark with a gun and a canister of liquid oxygen another sub-aquatic serial killer decides to do the copycat thing and help itself to the victims, sorry Islanders. If you think the serial killer conceit is a nothing, throw away kind of comment then its time you sat down and watched Jaws 2 again. The first and best sequel, not that that's saying much, in fact its like saying blood in the urine is better than a cleft face, is the one where the shark makes the transition from mere man eater to evil teen-stalking murderer. This one's got more in common with Halloween than the first film in that all the victims here tend to be attractive adolescent girls and their slightly awkward boyfriends plus in true, have I watched Scream recently or something - sequel style, the body count shoots up in addition to the ante. This is all backed up by a curious supernatural undercurrent - a sort of evil killer back from the dead kinda vibe. The crucial scene is the one in which the marine expert tries to put Brodys mind at rest by making the factual (and obvious) point that Sharks don't do revenge. Brody has other ideas though and as the hero is ALWAYS right in these situations, especially when up against any kind of institutional expert who holds the opposite view, we know there's something in his idea that If one shark were killed, you don't think another shark would... Would what Chief? Come back to kill you and your sons and all his friends? You better believe it. In fact as he looks ominously out to sea and up comes those foreboding strings, we know we're not dealing with any normal finned muncher - this one has an agenda. If the plan is to lure Brody out to sea for what it imagines will be a fairly one sided contest (this thing isn't afraid to eat a HELIPCOPTER!) then the execution is faultless. The first shark's twisted twin knows exactly how to push Brody's buttons. Kill a water-skier? Fine. Feed the police a few sinister pictures - not the face, just the eyes? Done. Build his on land based paranoia to threaten his career and sanity? Easy. And of course target the teens knowing that the great man will be duty bound to follow through and come looking? Holy human-steaks, its like a moth to the flame. In the end the Chiefs only hope against this Machivellian chew-machine is the pipe dream that the ocean will throw up a giant bolt of lighting from its mud strewn floor to fry the undersea equivalent of Peter Sutcliffe.

It's difficult, even unfair sometimes but it's awfully hard not to especially if the books are phenomenal successes or classics or even just a book that is one of your personal favorites. For me...the Left Behind Series of books (12 of them in total) were drop dead amazing. I was riveted for the year it took me to read them. I am now a huge fan of the series and I couldn't help but see the films. I had a lot to go on being such a fan of the books but I also know that the books AND the films are not for everyone!!! First of all..non Christians are going to be overtly critical, especially if they go into it expected a science fiction, End Of Days type movie event. This film is based on something that millions BELIEVE is truth so you have to take that into consideration. First of all for me personally I was blown away by Left Behind.Director Vic Sarin is no stranger to film making. He has worked in films for the last 4 decades at least. He has done pretty much everything so he is definitely a veteran film maker. I don't know if he had any contact with the original book by Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye but his casting choices were dead on for the most part and I stand by that. Kirk Cameron is the exception but I won't say he's bad. In fact he's quite good in the lead role of Cameron Buck Williams. Granted he's not quite as gritty, or street smart as his book counterpart but he's decent and considering that Cameron is more than directly responsible for the creation of this film at all. Relative newcomer Janaya Stephens plays a strong headed and take charge Chloe Steele and does a good job. The real brilliant casting is in the role of leading man Captain Rayford Steele who was such a huge hero in the book. Brad Johnson puts a face to that role and does a great job doing that. I don't even credit his acting necessarily but his look nails Rayford's personality and his acting is alright too. The other person is the anti-Christ himself Nicolae Carpathia played by Gordon Currie, a character actor who's been around for a long time. He is brilliant as both the charismatic caring leader and the dark, evil being he is to become.The story is very closely linked to the book and they did a good job of transferring book to screen and leaving the most important details in tact and only changing small details. I have heard complaints about this not being an original concept with typical government conspiracy and hit men and yadda yadda yadda well...first off NEWSFLASH nothing is an original concept anymore, it doesn't stop people from seeing it. In fact it seems that more than half the films released now are not only not original but direct rehashes of original films or series. I happen to think Left Behind The Movie puts a new spin on the Christian theory and does it excellently. The budget is low but still managed to pull off some intense action scenes, there are definite moments when the acting borderlines on campy but they are all not mainstream big actors and actresses and they do their best to make it real. The plot is actually quite complex and intriguing when you really watch. The whole concept of the anti-Christ killing his parents which was brought up in films like The Omen and End Of Days is changed completely to have Carpathia murdering his parent figures, the men who created him politically. The final scene in the film is disturbing and memorable with a powerful performance by both Cameron and Currie.The average person I can understand giving this a poor score...I could even understand someone being bored with it. It has it's moments. I think for me it's just a personal thing that I loved it and I loved the books and I hope they continue making the films. What I don't like is people nit picking it and saying how crappy it is simply because of it's basis in Christian faith. Grow up!! and open your mind, even if you don't believe it, you might be entertained. It's worth seeing and I know it's a cult classic so I'm not the the only one!! 8.5\/10 (For most probably a 5\/10 but I still encourage reading the book and watching the movie...it's got a lot to offer) ","genre":null},{"date":"21 October 2005","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" I hate to compare films to their literary counterparts.

He has done pretty much everything so he is definitely a veteran film maker. I don't know if he had any contact with the original book by Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye but his casting choices were dead on for the most part and I stand by that. Kirk Cameron is the exception but I won't say he's bad. In fact he's quite good in the lead role of Cameron Buck Williams. Granted he's not quite as gritty, or street smart as his book counterpart but he's decent and considering that Cameron is more than directly responsible for the creation of this film at all. Relative newcomer Janaya Stephens plays a strong headed and take charge Chloe Steele and does a good job. The real brilliant casting is in the role of leading man Captain Rayford Steele who was such a huge hero in the book. Brad Johnson puts a face to that role and does a great job doing that. I don't even credit his acting necessarily but his look nails Rayford's personality and his acting is alright too. The other person is the anti-Christ himself Nicolae Carpathia played by Gordon Currie, a character actor who's been around for a long time. He is brilliant as both the charismatic caring leader and the dark, evil being he is to become.The story is very closely linked to the book and they did a good job of transferring book to screen and leaving the most important details in tact and only changing small details. I have heard complaints about this not being an original concept with typical government conspiracy and hit men and yadda yadda yadda well...first off NEWSFLASH nothing is an original concept anymore, it doesn't stop people from seeing it. In fact it seems that more than half the films released now are not only not original but direct rehashes of original films or series. I happen to think Left Behind The Movie puts a new spin on the Christian theory and does it excellently. The budget is low but still managed to pull off some intense action scenes, there are definite moments when the acting borderlines on campy but they are all not mainstream big actors and actresses and they do their best to make it real. The plot is actually quite complex and intriguing when you really watch. The whole concept of the anti-Christ killing his parents which was brought up in films like The Omen and End Of Days is changed completely to have Carpathia murdering his parent figures, the men who created him politically. The final scene in the film is disturbing and memorable with a powerful performance by both Cameron and Currie.The average person I can understand giving this a poor score...I could even understand someone being bored with it. It has it's moments. I think for me it's just a personal thing that I loved it and I loved the books and I hope they continue making the films. What I don't like is people nit picking it and saying how crappy it is simply because of it's basis in Christian faith.

I am now a huge fan of the series and I couldn't help but see the films. I had a lot to go on being such a fan of the books but I also know that the books AND the films are not for everyone!!!

A joke never has the same effect when you know the punch line in advance. But every once in a blue moon, a comedy comes along that is so thoughtful and meaningful in addition to being funny that after seeing it a dozen times and laughing less often, I start noticing its depth and insight. For me, no movie has so perfectly united hilarity with profundity as Groundhog Day, which happens to be my favorite movie of all time.Superficially, this film belongs roughly in the same genre as All of Me and Liar Liar, comedies in which a character becomes the victim of some weird supernatural fate and must adapt to the insane logic of the situation. But Steve Martin and Jim Carrey are geniuses of physical comedy, whereas Bill Murray specializes in understatement. I can't imagine any other approach having worked for this film, where the world is going crazy around Phil the weatherman, Murray's hard-edged character who keeps his emotions bottled up. What makes the initial scenes in which he first discovers his fate so hilarious is the mounting panic in his demeanor even as he tries to act like everything's normal. All he can think of to say is, I may be having a problem. Uh, no kidding. Throughout the rest of the film, he'll deliver similarly muted lines to describe his situation, like My years are not advancing as fast as you might think. It's striking that a man who has all the time in the world would choose his words so carefully, but it reflects a well-conceived screenplay.In this comedy, the laughs are reinforced by repetition. The absurdity of Phil discovering that he's repeating the same day is funny enough, but every time that alarm clock goes off, and the radio starts playing, I Got You Babe, and Phil goes through the same motions and meets the same people and then goes out into the street to be accosted by the same annoying high school buddy (Phiiiil?), I laugh again because I'm reminded how funny it was the first time around. People who didn't like this film (I've met one or two) emphasize how annoying it is that everything gets repeated. I sort of understand that complaint, since jokes repeated over and over usually fail miserably. Groundhog Day, however, works uniquely well because the situation gets increasingly absurd and Phil gets increasingly desperate with each day that fails to pass.The film would have fizzled out quickly had it spent the entire hour-and-a-half showing Phil meeting the same people and doing the same things time and again. The fact that Groundhog Day avoids this fate is one of its more striking qualities, since most high-concept comedies of this sort fall apart in the third act. Groundhog Day is a rare example of one that completely follows through with its premise, leading from the initial situation logically to the ending. Only the Jeopardy scene feels like a skit that could have appeared anywhere. But this scene actually is placed wisely it occurs when Phil is becoming increasingly bored and lethargic, and it is used to separate two hilarious scenes where he gives nutty television reports.It is in the middle, centering on Phil's attempts to seduce Rita, when the film reveals itself to be more than just a comedy. The underlying implication of these scenes is that Phil's powers are less important than he thinks they are. He probably could have done the same things (such as his exploits with Nancy) under ordinary circumstances, without the hocus pocus. In the end, his powers don't matter, because Rita is too smart and sees right through him. She may not understand the full supernatural implications of what he's doing, but she senses that he's somehow manipulating the situation. Phil may think he's a god, but he isn't all-powerful.Phil's character development is convincing largely because we can so easily believe the situation would force him to look inward. Because he loves such a sincere woman as Rita, the only way he can finally impress her is by genuinely changing himself rather than faking it. The change he undergoes isn't an implausible leap, for he maintains many of the same basic character traits he had at the beginning, even though he becomes kinder and more caring. Earlier, Rita says that egocentrism is Phil's defining characteristic, and, indeed, he doesn't stop being egocentric at the end; he merely learns to channel the egocentrism in a positive direction.I have trouble imagining any other actor having pulled this off. Murray is not the only comic actor to have proved himself capable of dramatic depth, but he's one of the few who can so seamlessly combine his humorous and serious side into the same character. And he's a master at conveying complex emotions through an apparent deadpan. When his delivery sounds stilted in this film, the effect is intentional, for he's playing a man whose life has become a script.Though this film has a serious message, it is still quintessentially a comedy. But it's a comedy that uses psychological exploration of a fascinating character to make its point.

For many years when I was young- many years ago, this was my favorite movie. It had a mythical quality for me.So let me just sum up what I think are the great and remarkable things that make this movie a must see 1. Clearly, Marlon Brando. This is rightly considered to be one of the great performances in film history. Of all the brilliant choices he makes in crafting this role, there is one which (as an actor myself) I would like to point out as an illustration of his peerless technique.The scene is the one in which Terry and Edie are walking along the waterfront in the park, having just met, or rather rediscovered each other for the first time since childhood. At one point Edie drops a glove- a small white dress glove, and Terry picks it up. As he sits on a child's swing, telling her his philosophy of life, he absently pulls the small white glove on his hand.Whenever I watch this scene I literally shudder with pleasure at this gesture. It unleashes a flood of connotative information- Terry's vulnerability, his background as a boxer, his brutishness against the purity of the white glove. I don't know if this was an improvised or planned moment on Brando's part, but it demonstrates the genius that informed his instincts.This is a performance that any actor can go to school on.2. The locations and cinematography. Films are simply not shot entirely on location anymore and it shows. No amount of art direction will ever create a setting as convincing as this real one. Legend has it Kazan wanted the pale, sunken cheeks that filming during a cold New York (actually Hoboken) winter produced. This film is not only a great piece of fiction, but also a significant historical record.3. The score by Leonard Bernstein. Others may find this a little much, but I think its some of the great music composed for the movies by a great composer. I particularly think of the moment when (spoiler) as Terry is being called for Charlie and at the last minute he and Edie narrowly escape a truck, the truck passes to reveal Charlie's body. The score resolves from a pounding tension to a lyrical passage. A composer might be able to illuminate what he does here with the chord change- I can't, but it is very powerful, and very moving.4. The scene. For me the great pivotal scene only begins with the classic taxi cab scene- it doesn't end there. In one uninterrupted dramatic build we cut from the cab being driven into the back of a truck to Terry pounding on Edie's door. This is an almost equally famous scene as he breaks open the door, smashing the jamb, she fights him off and they finally collapse in an embrace, wedged in the tiny hallway of the apartment. There is the most momentary release of tension, and then we hear them calling Terry, telling him that Charlie wants to see him, and we are in the alley with the truck bearing down on them. This is all one long build from the cab, reinforced musically, and climaxes with the discovery of Charlie, hanging by a meat hook. The emotional complexity that Brando brings to this moment, as he gently lowers him, is heart-rending.Obviously, I could go on about the entire film, which I think has the same level of texture, detail, and emotional complexity in every scene. The cast is uniformly brilliant as is the direction. A masterpiece.

Both of these things come crashing into each other like a train in this film. This is hailed as the only anti-war war movie ever made. That is quite an accomplishment. And who else but Stanley Kubrick could have thought to do such a project and not give it any kind of structure?First, you see a meeting between the two men in question. One says they must do a doomed mission and there is another star medal in it for him if he behind his desk has a general go through with it. He, the corporal, at first says no until the higher up says that he'll just get someone else do it and ouch, without a medal if deserves. So, he agrees to go through with the doomed mission and thats when Kirk Douglas as the general has no choice but to go through with it...or get discharged from his men and have someone else that is 100% unqualified. Unqualified, you ask? Well, Kirk's character understands that you have to know your men to lead them and so some stranger can't just come in and try to lead men to their doom.
