When I first saw it, I didn't appreciate it, as expecting action, whatever. When I saw it six years and more accepting of movies and story, my whole view of the film changed. I choose this over Red Dragon any day, and I reckon a lot of other will too, if they haven't seen this. Take my advice. See it. This one has much more suited actors, and is more scary and bloody suspenseful. William Petersen is tailor made for this role, truly showing a guy, torn and scarred, slowly recovering day by day, from Lectors attack, that fateful night, after din din, which didn't only leave physical scars. An array of affected emotions is where Norton vastly lacked in showing us. From the very first frame, Petersen's performance has us. He reluctantly, though out of guilt, if feeling morally obliged to the victims, accepts the case to track down the tooth fairy, who's selecting families as victims for his sick and repressed sexual fantasies. Brian Cox's Lector is different, from Hopkin's where I still think Tony's better, but Cox is chillingly riveting, showing just what this great and versatile actor was capable of in his heyday, and still is. The others are also great, the tooth fairy killer, Dollarhyde, will made the hairs on your wrists stand up literally, while the blind woman is very strong too who could be the psycho's next victim, unless hot shot tracking expert, Will Graham (Petersen) has anything to say about it. The great character actor, Stephen Lang is at his scummy best, as a low life reporter, who gets his just desserts. The music rocks, a little unnerving when played to the tense scenes, affecting when played against the sad ones, and there are a few scores, all of which I liked. This excellent movie's a serial killer's smorgasboard, scarring unforgettable moments, triggered from writing this. If a lover of SOTL or Hannibal, and.... Red Dragon, the remake of this, you'll be totally absorbed by this, where the movie choosing more story over action, where too here, we get to know Graham's family more. The music works beautifully against the story but that's a trademark of Mann's films. The climax is smashingly terrific would say, while the whole movie is filmed to A1 perfection. The movie almost has a flawlessness to it. Violence is moderate in quota, and one feels this quota restrained, though some images are pretty strong, and like the others, this film is definitely not for the disturbed where this made four years, prior to Silence Of The Lambs, doesn't change that fact.

Although not his strongest film, Eyes Wide Shut is still a compelling picture, mostly due to the trance-like atmosphere it creates.The dreamlike mood that permeates the film, as well as the strange characters Tom Cruise's character encounters, almost makes this seem like a David Lynch film. Nevertheless, one is never in doubt that this is a Kubrick film, as each shot is meticulously crafted with Kubrick's trademark visual elegance. Eyes Wide Shut is meant to be Kubrick's exploration of sexual relations. Its deals with themes of lust and jealousy, and how these innate human characteristics can take their toll on a relationship. Bill (Tom Cruise) and Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman) play the married couple whose relationship begins to unravel when Alice admits she had sexual fantasies about another man, sparking Bill's jealousy and causing him to go on a sexual adventure that takes him to places he never could have imagined. Its here that the film is most compelling, and delivers some of the most memorable scenes ever to grace a Kubrick film. Although the pace of the film is quite slow, this is important in creating the dreamlike atmosphere, and the plot still remains intriguing. I was never bored. Cruise and Kidman both deliver strong performances. However, as per usual with any Kubrick film, its the director that is the star of the show. Although I'm a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick, this is probably the one complaint I would have about his style, as I feel that his perfectionism can sometimes detract from the raw quality of the performances. Its not often that I come away from his films feeling like I truly know the characters or have gone through fire and hell with them. Nevertheless, the film is a visual treat, and that is the reason that I keep coming back to Kubrick he is a visionary with images.Eyes Wide Shut is the last stunning work of the director's illustrious career. Its a fitting end to his legacy.

'Mars Attacks' doesn't have a lot (if any!) competition for that title. In the mid nineties, when alien invasion fever was at its highest, someone proposed a film about cheesy 1950s-style Martians attacking Earth and 'Mars Attacks' was born.The first thing you need to know about it is that it's an 'ensemble' piece, i.e. it has simply tonnes of A-list stars attached to the project. And, despite sounding impressive, that's kind of a downside. For none of them are really given enough screen time to get to know. There's absolutely no character development for any of them and, what's more, most of them are pretty objectionable anyway, leaving you cold when they finally get melted in a &#x96; visually-pleasing &#x96; array of colourful laser fire from out green, big-brained invaders. There are a couple of 'nicer' characters, but they're hardly in it enough for you to even remember their names. Many of the characters could have been removed completely and the story wouldn't have lost anything.Jack Nicholson is undoubtedly the 'main' character, as he plays the President of America. However, despite his acting abilities, he doesn't really do much as the role. Perhaps that's why they gave him another role to play, but, as I said before, half the characters could have been easily gotten away with and Jack's second performance is one of these.As for the story... well, there isn't really one. Mars does indeed attack, but not until about forty-five minutes into the movie. What you have is basically a 'sketch show' with many famous faces, all vying to 'out-horrible' each other.However, despite the film's many flaws, it's kind of worth a watch... but only for the Martians. They're completely the stars of the film. They get all the best lines (not that any are actually spoken in English) and are a delight to watch. In fact, they're so good they only go and double how bad their human (and un-computer-generated) co-stars are in comparison.If you think you can sit through a sketch-type alien invasion film with a few comedic moments (but not enough to really class the film as an out and out 'comedy') you should enjoy this.

It could be because it certainly has political overtones, but I was more entertained than politically guided with this film.Robert Redford's film is about a small town in New Mexico where it's predominated by Hispanics and Catholics. There is this one man named Joe Mondragon who illegally uses water to irrigate his beanfield and does what he can to protect it against the interests of big business.This film surprised me by having the acting it's best asset. I haven't heard of half of the cast, but they do a great job. There are several I've heard of such as John Heard, Christopher Walken, and Daniel Stern and I think they do a pretty good job. To be honest, I thought Stern would be funnier here since he is known as a funnyman.Overall, The Milagro Beanfield War is a vastly underrated film. It can be pretty funny at times without being too overly dramatic. It takes a while to get hooked into the film, but eventually you'll not want this film not to be ovefr. Not only does it have a good story, it's pretty to look at thanks to some fine cinematography and has a wonderful score by Dave Grusin.

To be honest, I thought Stern would be funnier here since he is known as a funnyman.Overall, The Milagro Beanfield War is a vastly underrated film. It can be pretty funny at times without being too overly dramatic. It takes a while to get hooked into the film, but eventually you'll not want this film not to be ovefr. Not only does it have a good story, it's pretty to look at thanks to some fine cinematography and has a wonderful score by Dave Grusin. I think more people should get to see this film because it's very good. I rate this film 9\/10.

Five years after Lowell Sherman and Constance Bennett asked that question, a new film, unofficially based upon that almost forgotten classic, came along, and created a legend which has (thus far) spawned two remakes, one even more famous than itself. Hollywood has always created dreams that turned into nightmares, not only for the young hopefuls who came out from the middle of nowhere and ended up jumping off the Hollywood sign, but for those who had made it and were branded has-beens. Think of the fictional Norma Desmond and the Hudson Sisters. Think of the real life sign jumper Peg Entwistle, as well as dwindling stars like John Barrymore, Ramon Novarro, Montgomery Clift and others who couldn't handle the pressures that hit them for various reasons and ended up with somewhat tragic finales. Hollywood can present much beauty, but for those inside the business, it is a living hell.Esther Blodgett (Janet Gaynor) is a young hopeful from hundreds of miles from Hollywood who longs to come to Tinseltown and work with the legends like the fictional Norman Maine (Fredric March), an Oscar Winner slowly falling down the ranks thanks to bad publicity, bad films, and especially, way too much booze. She struggles for months even just to get the rent paid and is on the verge of quitting when a miracle happens. By chance, she meets Mr. Maine who takes a liking to her (having earlier shusshed! her at a concert) and presents her to movie mogul Oliver Niles (Adolph Menjou) as a potential new star. She's fresh and unique, likable and talented, perky and sober. In short, she's everything Norman Maine is not. Her rise will mark his downfall, and yet nobody knows other than a few people that it was his confidence in her which helped build her star even brighter than his own.Esther Victoria Blodgett!, press agent Lionel Stander shouts, aghast. Cutting out Blodgett, Niles comes up with Vicky Lester, telling everybody to shout out Say Vicky Lester!, to which Stander cynically replies Vicky Vicky. But a bit part isn't enough for her, and at Norman's request, she gets the female lead in his newest film which is a smash for her but a critical slap for him. His pictures continue to bomb, and hers are hits, winning her an Oscar which results in his public humiliation. By this time, Norman and Victoria are married (under their real names), the offended Stander is outraged, and the stage is set for a finale both tragic and triumphant.As much as we have been warned about Hollywood success, we haven't learned that only a few rise to the top and stay there without any type of scandal. Norman Maine, whether being Lowell Sherman's version in What Price Hollywood or March's or James Mason or even Kris Kristofferson, can't bear a morning shoot without a drink, and for each drink he takes marks another notch towards his downfall. Gaynor, pretty much a has-been herself after being replaced at 20th Century Fox with Shirley Temple taking over the leading star spot, needed a hit like A Star is Born and is outstanding. She's comical (imitating a variety of stars at a Hollywood party) and touching, while March is profound, even in Norman's most drunken state.Playing a film studio owner\/lead producer much like Selznick or Goldwyn, Menjou is a gentle patriarchal figure, loyal to March's Norman but unable to help him get another leading role thanks to the proved failures of his past. Stander is gruff and even nasty, letting his vile towards Norman spill out so evilly that you know that even the strongest person fighting to stay sober would be tempted to break their pledge. Andy Devine is amusing as Gaynor's confidante, with May Robson authoritative as her beloved grandmother and an unbilled Clara Blandick dominating every moment of the opening scene as the movie-hating aunt.Everything about this film is outstanding, with excellent Technicolor photography and a structure which has the film open and end as if it were the visions inside the opening shot of the first page of the screenplay and its last as the film wraps up. William Wellman was a master of storytelling and utilized Dorothy Parker and Alan Campbell's screenplay to almost become a Hollywood Bible to indicate the ten commandments of becoming a star with Hell being big stars becoming has-beens for breaking these rules.

The character development, I thought, weren't as strong as well, as it appears the lead actors, Tom Skerritt and Nancy Allen, didn't give a very heartfelt performance in their roles and didn't appear to have a strong relationship with Carol Anne. There are still some creepy scenes and the special effects were decent. Again, like the first two movies, this sequel doesn't rely on gore and violence to make it entertaining, but rather relies on the ghost's presence and the powers they are able to unleash. The screenplay and story by Steve Feke, Gary Sherman and Brian Taggert were OK-written, a plot that is easy to follow, but not an extremely riveting story overall. The direction by Gary Sherman was OK and the acting was pretty great for the most part, most notably the performances of Heather O'Rourke as Carol Anne and Zelda Rubinstein as Tangina.Overall, it's not great, it's not bad, but is a somewhat average movie to close out the Poltergeist trilogy.Grade C+ ","genre":null},{"date":"28 May 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This is an OK second sequel to Poltergeist, where Carol Anne has been sent to live with her Aunt Patricia and Uncle Bruce to hide from Reverend Kane.
