His portrayal of Tommy is haunting. Here is a man that is so insecure and wants to be the top dog, the made man so bad that he can't decipher between what is a joke and what is disrespect towards him. Of course the scene in question is when he shoots a common boy for telling Paulie to screw himself after Paulie shot him in the leg. You would think the guy has a right to let off a little steam and vent, but Paulie is always looking for the diss. He is always looking to find some hidden gesture from someone that is putting him down. Even at the beginning when he is getting on Henri in the now famous  You're a funny guy  scene. He is kidding with Henri but deep down inside he is angry with him, you can see it and feel it. Joe Pesci gave the performance of his career and he richly deserved to win best supporting actor that year.The story and script by Pileggi is sheer inside brilliance. You can feel the inside observations that no one can have except for a guy that spent his whole life on the inside. They ring so true and they get into your blood. From scenes like the fat guy running around delivering messages to the other mob guys because he doesn't like to use the phone to the scene when Henri, Paulie and Tommy have Billy Bats in the trunk but they stop off at Tommy's moms house for a late night dinner of pasta and such. They also have to borrow a sharp knife to finish off the guy in the trunk, but to his mom they have to cut off the hoof of a dear that hit the car. And the scene where Tommy does kill the young kid for joking with him and then Paulie gets mad at him, not for killing the guy but because he doesn't want to dig a hole tonight. There are so many tiny observations in Goodfellas that give it the authenticity it has. And it is a film that stays with you for years to come. I think this is Scorcese's best film and although I understand and accept why the academy awarded Dances With Wolves the accolades it did, if this film would have swept the Oscars that year, no one would have been surprised. It is a landmark film and I think it is one of the best films ever made. And again, taking no credit away from Coppolla's Godfather epics, but this gets inside the mafia on a deeper level. It goes one step beyond what Coppolla gave us, and for that Goodfellas should be remembered as the best film about gangsters ever made.

Soon the host finds herself being held by the cannibal family and gaining the affections of Leatherface.THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2 is probably one of the most hated sequels in the history of cinema. It was released with a lot of hype but pretty much died at the box office and it got a beating from fans and critics. Those expecting anything like the original are bound to be disappointed but once you accept that this is more of a comedy than a horror film and you view it on its own merits, the film really isn't all that bad. It's certainly an incredibly flawed film but at the same time I respect director Tobe Hooper for trying something different.When you get down to it, this here is basically just a remake of the first film but done in a tongue-in-cheek way. The film's incredibly troubled production has been discussed to death but the budget was cut and apparently Hooper's vision was for something much bigger but we can only judge what's here. I think the biggest problem with the movie is the fact that it runs way too long with the climax of the picture clocking in at over a hour. I'm going to guess that there was a lot more character build up planned for the Hopper character. Speaking of Hopper, the film does benefit from a colorful cast and some interesting characters. Hopper manages to turn in a good performance, although he doesn't seem too thrilled to be appearing in a movie like this. Williams is certainly delightful as the radio host and there's no question that her personality is one of a kind. Lou Perry is exceptionally funny and memorable in his role. Jim Siedow is fun in his return and Bill Moseley is memorable as well. Bill Johnson can't match the original Leatherface but then again he really wasn't asked to. He's good in the part when you consider what Hooper was going for.The film also benefits from some great special effects from Tom Savini and there's no question that Hooper builds up a rather interesting atmosphere. Again, this film tried for something big and original and while, in the end, it failed, there's still no question that you've got to respect Hooper for trying something different instead of just delivering the same type of film as the first.

But after checking out some of the reviews I was almost turned away by the shear amount of hate this movie was getting. But a few people did give it 10\/10 and glorious praise, for which I don't know why. Event Horizon just wasn't that scary. The acting and cinematography were great but the movie was lacking in the scares department. The reason for this I believe was because of the lack of an antagonist for the majority of the movie. Unlike Alien which creates a dark atmosphere by letting the audience know that there is something out to get the crew Event Horizon didn't have this. For the first hour of the movie I thought they were all just hallucinating until the doctor went crazy and started killing everyone. At that point he just looked like a cheap knock off of they guy from Hellraiser. The movie also felt very rushed at the end, like the director was just trying to finish it up as fast as he could, like he didn't really care about the movie. Another thing that made me dislike the movie was the fact that there was a lot of comedic relief, especially in really intense scenes and that just didn't work well with this movie at all. Just as I was starting to get a little spooked one of the characters would completely ruin the feeling by saying something funny. It just felt out of place and did not sit well in a dark movie like this. Overall I give Event Horizon a 6\/10. I did give it higher than many people because the special effects, acting, and overall idea were great but it was just lacking. The story was convoluted and jumped around, and the movie just felt like I was watching Alien without the alien itself in it. This is the type of movie that should be remade. A great idea for a movie that just wasn't completed to it's full potential.

It's a biopic of one of the greatest wasted talents of the American track athletic history Steve Prefontaine. Prefontaine nearly won a medal at the 1972 Olympics but was edged out at the last lap and came in fourth instead. It is a movie about promise, disappointment and ultimately loss and tragedy.Billy Crudup plays Prefontaine very convincingly, so much so that you forget you are watching an actor and not the man himself. This was made in the time when Crudup was just establishing himself as a new force and new star in Hollywood and this role certainly helped him establish himself as that. He is an exciting talent and very capable in expressing the emotions this part requires. Donald Sutherland of course plays his coach and the inventor of Nike shoes, Bill Bowerman. He also gives a great portrayal of the man who was the main mentor and trainer of Prefontaine, almost like a second father to him. Monica Potter plays Prefontaine's love interest and adds a love angle to the film, which makes it complete and more enjoyable to watch.The beginning and the first half of this film is the most enjoyable part and also contains some humorous scenes, such as the one where Sutherland exposes one of Pre's college stable mates as well endowed, to the man's embarrassment. Also, we see the rise of Steve's career on national level, which culminates in the race where he beats the legendary Frank Shorter. However, the triumph doesn't last as he takes part in the Munich Olympics and makes a great race, only to run out of gas in the last lap and get overtaken by three men. There is a brief scene afterwards where the winner, Finland's Lasse Viren, gives a brief look of sympathy and acknowledgment to the disappointed Prefontaine and this scene is one of the dramatic high points of the film. It expresses the feeling of competing at this level and how it is to lose and win sometimes the line is very thin between winners and losers. The direction is great and kudos to the director Robert Towne for doing such a great job on what was his only third directing job. He is otherwise known mostly as a screenwriter but this movie proved he definitely had something to offer as a director to. In the end, one can only think about how the 1976 Olympics and the history of long distance running would look had Steve not driven so fast that night.

I grew up with this film. Tango & Cash is 1989 underrated Action classic film. The amalgamation of Sylvester Stallone's sheer magnetism, and Kurt Russell's commanding stage presence, has yielded a sonnet the likes of which all Films aspire to be. Stallone portrays Raymond 'Ray' Tango a highly decorated narcotics detective from Beverly Hills, who penchant for the stock market, has granted him not only the finer things in life but also a means to express his sophisticated nature and aspirations of financial independence. Stallone masterfully shows the dichotomy of a character who is highly educated and well mannered, yet is beset in a cesspool of crime and depravity, Tango yearns for a better society yet will not rest on his laurels of law and order. Gabriel 'Gabe' Cash portrayed by the immaculate Kurt Russell, is the antipodean of Stallone's level headed Tango. Cash is pugnacious, assertive, and jealous yet his diligence to enforce law and order at all cost define this tortured soul. Although this crass inner city detective has a disheveled appearance and tough exterior he is simply trying to hide his true feelings and desires for true love in an otherwise barbaric society. All in all this film is the crowning achievement of Stallone and Russell and the Hollywood film industry. It is a cut of history, when master Artisans the like of Russell and Stallone are brought together at their peak with visionaries leading them to produce what is their destiny FUBAR!!!!!!!!!

The amalgamation of Sylvester Stallone's sheer magnetism, and Kurt Russell's commanding stage presence, has yielded a sonnet the likes of which all Films aspire to be. Stallone portrays Raymond 'Ray' Tango a highly decorated narcotics detective from Beverly Hills, who penchant for the stock market, has granted him not only the finer things in life but also a means to express his sophisticated nature and aspirations of financial independence. Stallone masterfully shows the dichotomy of a character who is highly educated and well mannered, yet is beset in a cesspool of crime and depravity, Tango yearns for a better society yet will not rest on his laurels of law and order. Gabriel 'Gabe' Cash portrayed by the immaculate Kurt Russell, is the antipodean of Stallone's level headed Tango. Cash is pugnacious, assertive, and jealous yet his diligence to enforce law and order at all cost define this tortured soul. Although this crass inner city detective has a disheveled appearance and tough exterior he is simply trying to hide his true feelings and desires for true love in an otherwise barbaric society. All in all this film is the crowning achievement of Stallone and Russell and the Hollywood film industry. It is a cut of history, when master Artisans the like of Russell and Stallone are brought together at their peak with visionaries leading them to produce what is their destiny FUBAR!!!!!!!!! It is my favorite best action film and the second Stallone best film along with Cobra from the 80's. I love the action sequences, the prison sequences, I love Robert Z'Dar as The Jaw in the film he is more memorable for me Matt Cordell as Maniac Cop from the 80's. That is why I love the films from the 80's and 90's more than I do now.Tango & Cash is a 1989 American buddy cop action comedy film that was mainly directed by Andrei Konchalovsky, although Albert Magnoli took over in the later stages of filming.3 It stars Sylvester Stallone, Kurt Russell, Jack Palance, and Teri Hatcher. The film was released in the United States on December 22, 1989.The film describes the struggle of Raymond Tango and Gabriel Cash, two rival LAPD narcotics detectives, who are forced to work together after the criminal mastermind Yves Perret frames both of them for murder.Two cops are framed and must clear their names. this was the only film directed from Andrei Konchalovsky that stayed in my memories from him. The director for me in unknown, sorry. Sylvester Stallone did great job portraying his character L.A. Cop Raymond Tango. Kurt Russell was awesome as L.A. Cop Gabriel Cash. Teri Hatcher as Katherine Kiki Tango was excellent as Ray's sister. Yes she was his sister not his mistress, girlfriend or his wife, she was his sister which I love in this movie! Jack Palance as crime boss Yves Perret was excellent villain. Brion James as Requin was amazingly tough guy villain. James Hong as Quan another villain was also awesome. The most awesome to me was Robert Z'Dar as The Jaw he was terrific in this film.I love this film to death I love it is my favorite film and I love it to death!10\/10 Grade A+ Studio Warner Bros.

It stars Keanu Reeves as a drunken gambler thrust into coaching an urban kids baseball team by a friend who will pay him $500 a week to do so. He figures that the money will pay off debts but he never factored in the behavior. This all leads to a happy ending for all save for the audience. Director Brian Robbins is responsible for Varsity Blues, as well as such crap as Good Burger and Ready to Rumble. He lets the material get away on him like a bunch of kids at an amusement park. It has no originality and characters say lines like, I'm blown away by your ability to show up. I am blown away by his ability to say that with a straight face. Reeves makes little impression playing a role that has been done fifty times over. Diane Lane is basically a romantic prop for when Reeves has a free moment. Are we to be surprised when these two hook up? D.B. Sweeney plays Reeves's crime pal, although being in this film is perhaps his biggest crime. This is the kind of film that you line up and bat baseballs at just to see if one can smash a dent in it. It is one of the worst sports films ever made. Arguably about inner city kids seeking opportunity but the formula has been done so many times that it hits too many foul balls.
