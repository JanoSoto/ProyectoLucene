Doubtful, determined, passionate, naive, heartbroken, firm and charismatic - she is quite simply the best on-screen incarnation of Elizabeth in the long history of biopics.

To his credit, he retained as much of Williams' dialog as possible, particularly towards the beginning and the end of the film, but there is considerable padding in-between, and Vidal, who was Clever at best, does not live up to the standard of Williams, no doubt one of the factors that fueled his obvious, and seething, jealousy towards his good friend. The padding includes mad-house scenes where the extras were obviously encouraged to whoop it up like the extras in 28 DAYS LATER, and lots of heavy-handed hints about Sebastian's, er, proclivities.Violet Venable (Katherine Hepburn) is a rich widow with a million dollars to give away. She's thinking about giving it away to the Lion's View Sanitarium, a public mental hospital in New Orleans, to help pay for such things as, well, keeping the power on. There's only one catch; she'd like their hot-shot brain surgeon, Dr. Cukrowicz (Montgomery Clift), a recent transplant from Chicago, to perform a lobotomy on her niece Catherine Holly (Elizabeth Taylor), the better to end her obscene babblings about Mrs. Venable's son Sebastian, who had died the previous summer. Eventually, Cukrowicz injects the young woman with Sodium Pentothal and discovers that Sebastian was homosexual and that he used first his mother, and then his cousin, as beards to arrange homosexual liaisons with other men. His mother was useful when he was young and trying to hook up with sophisticated older men. He started using his cousin the year before to pick up the rough trade at public beaches (she caught their eye and then he started handing out the cash).

She only connects in flashes after that, although she is genuinely affecting at the end when she recalls finding the dead man's munched-upon remains. Her scream and the crying after that are filled with genuine horror and sadness.As the doctor, Cukrowicz, Montgomery Clift has a nothing part, but he displays a certain amused reserve while doing nothing much and is the audience's connection to the real world of sane people, where rich old ladies aren't trying to get people's brains chopped up and their gay sons come back from the Mediterranean with a tan . . .Joseph L.

The film was Schwimmer's first attempt at non-'Friends' success but it bombed terribly at the box office and as a result remains unusual and unique in that so far it is his only attempt to carry a picture. I'm hesitant to call a it a star vehicle because it also features Gwenyth Paltrow but that is essentially what it is, or at least tries\/was meant to be.I actually like this movie but I would have found it ultimately forgettable if it hadn't been constantly shown on one of the more obscure digital TV channels late at night just as I was coming in from work for a 6 month period a few years back.It has a good and recognisable cast which will put an audience at ease. Rappaport is as usual very funny and Schwimmer plays a very 'Ross'-esque character, given a ridiculous hair cut so that we can obviously differentiate from his 'Friends' persona. Paltrow looks cute and does what she does best.....pouts a lot.The plot itself centres around Schwimmer's character attempting to negotiate a relationship beyond friendship with his high school crush (Paltrow) who he has not been in contact with for years, presumably as he has only recently returned from completing his college studies. This is somewhat hindered though as he has also become intimately involved with the grieving mother of a recently deceased local man played by Barabra Hershey who believes, wrongly, that Schwimmer's character was her departed son's best , and for that matter only, friend at high school. As he is looking for some excitement in life Scwimmer's character was more than willing to maintain this incorrect assumption in order to bed the vulnerable Hershey character but after peddling the deception to the point where he delivers the eulogy at her son's funeral (at which he is also a Pallbearer hence the film's title) guilt begins to catch up with him and the 'Graduate'-esqu style of excitement he had previously felt is replaced by regret. There is also the underlying feeling to which many can probably relate of a post graduate who is struggling to move on with his life. This of course summons further comparisons with the earlier mentioned 'Graduate' from which this picture obviously draws major though not overly obvious influences.Tom Thompson (Schwimmer) has achieved an architectural degree but is struggling to find employment in the field and is back living in his old bedroom at his mother's house which looks , and where he is treated, like he is still at high school. To make matters worse his friends who live near by are all in 9-5 jobs and have all moved on with their lives to the point they are either married or engaged and are considering starting families. The relationship with Hershey seems to give a feeling of maturity whilst the reemergence of Paltrow has allowed him to recall happier and simpler times in his life where he wasn't under so much pressure to grow up.The story itself can be viewed as simplistic and not very exciting but it was matched by the slow pace. I myself actually appreciated it but maybe thats because I found relevance to my own life. Either way the audience can get some enjoyment out of the actor's performances and some sharp dialogue and set pieces. There are also some nice directorial touches though the film is not what you would call stylistic or a talky for that matter.Shwimmer's dead-pan comedic tone and facial expressions worked as well here as they do in 'Friends'. I felt he was just right for the role and enjoyed his performance. Though I accept that he is not to everyone's taste and for that reason many people will probably not enjoy this movie. Being a Shwimmer fan here is not a necessity but it certainly helps.On the whole this is the kind of film which works well at entertaining in a kind of personal way and in a subdued setting IE.- late at night in your living room with nothing else on or perhaps a rainy Saturday afternoon. It would have been an extremely unsatisfying cinematic event though and that is probably where most of the bad press for it comes from.Definitely not perfect but none the less a decent film which is made all the more worth while if you approach it with low expectations like I did.The underlying theme is about facing up to the difficulty of that crossroads in life when we realise that perhaps its time to move on from being a carefree youth to a mature adult. If that interests you then I guess this movie you will appreciate.

The film was Schwimmer's first attempt at non-'Friends' success but it bombed terribly at the box office and as a result remains unusual and unique in that so far it is his only attempt to carry a picture. I'm hesitant to call a it a star vehicle because it also features Gwenyth Paltrow but that is essentially what it is, or at least tries\/was meant to be.I actually like this movie but I would have found it ultimately forgettable if it hadn't been constantly shown on one of the more obscure digital TV channels late at night just as I was coming in from work for a 6 month period a few years back.It has a good and recognisable cast which will put an audience at ease. Rappaport is as usual very funny and Schwimmer plays a very 'Ross'-esque character, given a ridiculous hair cut so that we can obviously differentiate from his 'Friends' persona. Paltrow looks cute and does what she does best.....pouts a lot.The plot itself centres around Schwimmer's character attempting to negotiate a relationship beyond friendship with his high school crush (Paltrow) who he has not been in contact with for years, presumably as he has only recently returned from completing his college studies. This is somewhat hindered though as he has also become intimately involved with the grieving mother of a recently deceased local man played by Barabra Hershey who believes, wrongly, that Schwimmer's character was her departed son's best , and for that matter only, friend at high school. As he is looking for some excitement in life Scwimmer's character was more than willing to maintain this incorrect assumption in order to bed the vulnerable Hershey character but after peddling the deception to the point where he delivers the eulogy at her son's funeral (at which he is also a Pallbearer hence the film's title) guilt begins to catch up with him and the 'Graduate'-esqu style of excitement he had previously felt is replaced by regret. There is also the underlying feeling to which many can probably relate of a post graduate who is struggling to move on with his life. This of course summons further comparisons with the earlier mentioned 'Graduate' from which this picture obviously draws major though not overly obvious influences.Tom Thompson (Schwimmer) has achieved an architectural degree but is struggling to find employment in the field and is back living in his old bedroom at his mother's house which looks , and where he is treated, like he is still at high school. To make matters worse his friends who live near by are all in 9-5 jobs and have all moved on with their lives to the point they are either married or engaged and are considering starting families. The relationship with Hershey seems to give a feeling of maturity whilst the reemergence of Paltrow has allowed him to recall happier and simpler times in his life where he wasn't under so much pressure to grow up.The story itself can be viewed as simplistic and not very exciting but it was matched by the slow pace. I myself actually appreciated it but maybe thats because I found relevance to my own life. Either way the audience can get some enjoyment out of the actor's performances and some sharp dialogue and set pieces. There are also some nice directorial touches though the film is not what you would call stylistic or a talky for that matter.Shwimmer's dead-pan comedic tone and facial expressions worked as well here as they do in 'Friends'. I felt he was just right for the role and enjoyed his performance. Though I accept that he is not to everyone's taste and for that reason many people will probably not enjoy this movie.

But seen as a fascinating period piece, this once shocking play still possesses a disturbing power. The idea of an eight year old murderess is still unsettling, and most of the credit must go to actress Patty McCormack, who is chilling in the role of the homicidal Rhoda Penmark.Nancy Kelly has the challenging task of carrying most of the movie, and ably conveys a mother slowly breaking down under the gathering suspicion that her beloved child is a calculating killer. If at times her acting seems a little too overwrought or stylized, bear in mind that acting styles have changed in the fifty years since this play was first produced on Broadway. I have seen the movie several times over the years, and was actually quite impressed with Kelly's performance in my most recent viewing.What mother wouldn't seem pretty over the top in her behavior, faced with the unbearable truth Christine Penmark must cope with alone? Someone else pointed out that today, various social and medical services and help would be available to people in traumatic situations, that fifty years ago simply didn't exist. The mother is desperately alone in her crisis.Eileen Heckart is genuinely uncomfortable to watch as the drunken, grieving mother of Claude Daigle. I felt she was absolutely convincing as the tragic character she played. People have used the word  heartbreaking to describe her, and I agree completely.The film has a good, ominous musical score by Alex North, solid direction by Mervyn LeRoy, and excellent supporting performances, especially from Evelyn Varden as the doting landlady Monica, and Henry Jones as the sly, vaguely sinister janitor, Leroy.The Bad Seed has its share of awkward moments, dated ideas and unintentional humor. But the overall impact is quite powerful and it certainly deserves its reputation as a disturbing thriller. People disagree on whether it can be properly classified as a horror movie, but I think the description fits pretty well. Patty McCormack's star turn as the homicidal little girl is one of the creepiest portrayals I've ever seen.

Requiem for a Dream is an extremely important, potently well-crafted film, and it deserves to be given attention. As opposed to many works from young filmmakers, it isn't experimental and apprehensive. This is a full-fledged, confident directorial vision carried out with utmost precision. With his debut film Pi, released two years prior to Requiem, Darren Aronofsky proved himself to be a bold and exciting new voice in cinema. Pi is a great film. Requiem for a Dream is a flat-out masterpiece.The story charts the corrosion of four people's souls, the decaying of relationships and the shattering of delusions as the result of human weakness. This story shows us that there are forces more powerful than love and hope &#150; it is a bleak examination of addiction's triumph over the mind and spirit. Like most crime dramas, we see the rise before the fall. However, unlike films like Scorsese's GoodFellas (1990) and Casino (1995), the rise in this picture is as tragic as the fall. Aronofsky injects the story with a relentless sense of impending doom, and it reaches a crescendo of horror rather than a complete shift in tone.Harry (Jared Leto) and Marion (Jennifer Connelly) are deeply in love. They make each other happy and they are perfectly content to sleep the afternoon away together. They support each other's vague dreams and provide each other with comfort and empathy. They also share addiction &#150; he to heroin, she to cocaine. Harry and his best buddy Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) work together distributing drugs in the streets, and Harry uses the money to buy Marion the time for her to make clothing designs.Harry's mother Sara has been abandoned to an extent. Her son frequently takes advantage of her vulnerability and sells her television for drug money. She's a sad, lonely old woman who wants nothing more than to be noticed. She misses her son and deceased husband terribly, and she creates fairy-tale delusions in her mind to keep herself feeling balanced. Eventually she is drawn into taking diet pills, which she develops a dangerously strong addiction to. Clinging to her distorted views and empty contentment, her life begins to fall to pieces along with Harry's, Marion's and Tyrone's.Inevitably, the four characters first disconnect from each other, and then from themselves. Their final, ferocious downfall is devastating to witness. Darren Aronofsky structures the film beautifully, like a poem, so that we feel the story's arc even as we are consumed by these characters and their pain. All four performances are spectacular, particularly Ellen Burstyn's. Her shameless portrayal is gut-wrenching in its conviction; this ruined old woman and all of her pathetic tragedy is presented more powerfully than one could imagine.Technically speaking the film is a marvel. Clint Mansell's pulsing, relentless score is unforgettably haunting, and much of the film's strong mood owes credit to it. Darren Aronofsky fills the story with a frantic energy of its own, making use of everything from hip-hop montages to repetitive Snorri-cam shots. Several moments throughout the movie are infused by flashes of ingenious sound mixing &#150; such as montage sound effects melting into a jet taking off, which then in turn ebbs its way into Mansell's most sorrowful piece of music.Ultimately, Requiem for a Dream is more about its effects than the story itself. This isn't an anti-drug movie, and to dismiss it as one is to miss its point entirely. Like any great tragedy, it depicts the flaws in its heroes and the decay of their joy as a result.

Where an old lady gave him a watch and ask him to come back. Most of the movies is well done except for the sad ending, which is why this movie bombed at the box office. Since Chris Reeve has sadly died, already the movie is revived again and since his death was seen as sad, the movie has a same them, which people should be able to view this movie better in light of what happened. The story evolves around Chris Reeve a playwright just finishing college at Mayfield with bright prospects of his future in writing plays in a graduating party has met an old lady to ask him to come back and gave him a pocket watch. Eight years later, he has a writers block, is separated from his girlfriend, decided to go out some place and accidentally rode pass by Grand Hotel and decides to stay. He is met with an old bellboy who knows the past, and he sees a mysterious woman in the Hall of History. What got him interested was that she too was involved in the play. The time travel idea began when Chris Reeve decided to see this old lady and found out she was dead the night of his meeting with the old lady, and her favorite book Travels Through Time gave him an upshot to contact the writer of the book, which was his old professor at Mayfield College. From then on, the fun begins when he travels to 1912 to meet the girl of his dreams. *********** Now for the spoilers - ALTERNATE ENDING The story could have been a lot better to get the required good ending because I don't like sad ending. Therefore, the alternate ending, during the opening scenes, where the old lady gave Chris Reeve the pocket watch, she should have said Grand Hotel, A copper penny don't take it out of your pocket, I will get it for you and you look at it! Now when the near ending comes, Chris Reeve remembers what the old lady said, and he ask the same girl in the past that's something is in his pocket, so she decided to get it for him. The penny was handled by her, she see's it's a copper penny dated 1972, shocked at seeing it she RETURNS to the future with Chris Reeve to save his life later to return to the past after resolving things that happened with him and her in this future, both Chris Reeve and his girlfriend are now living in the same house, both well known actress and playwright together living in 1980.

I think the reason why these movies don't work is because 101 Dalmations, the original, was a cartoon, it just worked better and was more appealing to the kids as well as adults. This was not really that fun because it's adults running around trying to act like cartoons instead of just actual human beings, I understand they're trying to make sure that it's appealing to the kids, but it's ridicules to see the way these actors are behaving in the film. And 102 Dalmations's story isn't really that good.Cruella De Vil has been in prison for a while, but things change when she is proved that she now loves animals and is a pleasant human being. But her reputation is now damaged as a puppy-napper, but she buys a man's dog shelter and is all of a sudden is being loved by everyone and it looks like she's changed. But when she sees her probation officer's Dalmatians, she goes crazy and starts seeing spots, and she looses it.

Surely AFI would not want to put this one in the high-caliber humor hits in the history of movies. Still, Dumb and Dumber is one of the funnest comedies of the last 20 years. We meet Lloyd (Jim Carey) and Harry (Jeff Daniels). Both are inept, moronic imbeciles who plan to own a pet store called I Got Worms. Good luck not only on raising the money, but even more on getting the loan. In any case, both have their odd jobs to get them through. Lloyd's life changes when he drives a woman, Mary (Lauren Holly), to the airport in his limousine, and she forgets her luggage. He decides to take it to her in Aspen, Colorado with the help of Harry. However, the luggage is actually ransom money for her husband. Harry and Lloyd have no idea, but they could really use the money since they have so little. They eventually discover it trying to find Mary, and on their tail are the kidnappers. It reminded me of a Three Stooges, Marx Brothers, or Abbot and Costello movie. However, with these guys, there is no straight man, nor any intelligence. This paves the way for idiotic miscarriages of common sense. Simply put, the audience will laugh because we can be assured that our intelligence is superior. This one also started the gross-out comedy. Looking back, the gross-outs in this one were not over-the-top. They were simple and much more plausible situations. Again, we can laugh because it is not us. There are no breakout performances, nor deft screen writing. Another strength for the movie is that it could work for kids as well as adults.

To complicate matters, at times she seems invisible to people around her, but not always. Nobody understands her dilemma.From the get-go, viewers understand that Carnival Of Souls is low-budget. Production design is weak; secondary performances are amateurish. And the plot is choppy, with jarring scene splices. But that intermittent organ music and the noirish B&W lighting engender a trance-like feel that propels the viewer's interest in Mary and her story.But that story doesn't really lead anywhere. And the plot is peppered with filler scenes and contrivances. For example, why is Mary so drawn to the Pavilion? We're never told. It just seems like a locale that the film's director had access to, and therefore could use for various scenes. But it's not organic to the story.

Further, the lighting is fine, and when combined with that Gothic organ music induces a sense of dread and foreboding.Far from being ahead of its time, as some have suggested, the film strikes me as typical of dramas from the early 1960s. If the story had been condensed to a thirty minute television drama, I can just hear Rod Serling interject at the end And so, Mary Henry, anxious to leave home for a new life elsewhere takes an unexpected detour, and finds herself in ... the twilight zone.

But I have to point out that the; direction is average ( raw one moment \/ standard Hollywood the next and neither done in any particularly eye catching form) there doesn't seem to be any kind of story here, apart from the AIDS message and focus is often lost on that.The subplot (to the non-existent main plot) has something powerful to say. But it is not maintained by much outside of the Taxi driver's decent speech on life and Sevigny's character occasionally asking Has anyone seen Telly?.Harmony Korine has in many ways got away with murder in getting this film funded\/ directed by an experienced photographer in Clark and distributed by Mira-Max (operating under an independent name so as not to incur the wrath of they're pay masters Disney) in the screenplays current form. I mean it could have done with about 3 or 4 rewrites in order to hone it's focus and clarify it's message.I've also got to criticise some of the performances. Sevigny looks out of her depth in this. Kind of numb and uninteresting throughout the whole film. Its very difficult to distinguish between her sober and stoned. And its almost impossible to feel sympathy for her such is the unconvincing level of her performance when she is upset. Leo Fitzgerald also seems inadequate as Telly. There is some good non-dialogue scenes from him but when he opens his mouth he just sounds plain stupid. I found it hard to believe that an uneducated ignoramus with the appearance of a junkie could be Manhattan's under 16s ladies man.However a lot of the younger kids at the party scene near the end are very impressive. They're dialogue is very well scripted and executed. And Justin Pearce looked like a star in the making. I thought he was brilliant and towered above the other lead roles of Sevigny and Fitzpatrick who were just plain poor. Sad to hear that at the age of only 25 , Justin Pearce took his own life. He definitely could have gone on to bigger things.Anyway 'Kids' did have it's heart in the right place but it's execution was disappointing and it looked like a rushed job to me. Some better casting, direction and scripting\/story development could've made this a powerful picture. But I guess thats the case with most average to bad films.I think its interesting how America was so disgusted by this kind of gritty, harsh realism. I also think its slightly amusing how some of the American commentators think that gives it some kind of shocking originality. Believe me there are many European films ie- 'Prisoner of the Mountain' (Russia), 'La Hain'( France), 'Small Faces', 'Trainspotting', 'A Sense of Freedom'(Scotland), 'Made in Britain', 'The War Zone', 'Scum' and'The Firm'(England) which are all at the very least equal if not way ahead in portraying depressing and graphic realities.

I didn't even realize that this was Greg Kinnear's (rather inauspicious) film debut. I'm sure he'd like this one deleted off his resume! As well as Jon Polito, playing yet another version of his stereotypical mobster character that he first portrayed so well in MILLER'S CROSSING (1988). I already know from an interview he did on NPR that Damon Wayans would like to have this one back. He said it began with the Handyman character he did on the show In Living Color and somehow got metamorphosed into...this.Let me make this clear I did not laugh once during this entire 79-minute piece of crap. Even the movie's short length was not enough to save it. Or watch it. I guess the only good thing about this movie is that it put the final nail in the coffin of Robin Givens' film career. I have nothing against her, and God knows she suffered being married to Mike Tyson, but a film actress she is not. Sorry! Speaking of which, if you actually watch this movie, you will be sorry for having wasted 79 minutes of your life cringing at the embarrassing gyrations of the nerdy character played by Damon Wayans.

Sure it wasn't the first to include an element of horror, but unlike other classic Sci-Fi\/Horror films before it, it was made with much time, thought, and care. What sounded like just another B movie turned out to be a terrifying experience and a smash hit. It took 7 years, but a sequel finally came, but from a very different director, who also wrote the screenplay. Having only two feature films to his credit at the time, including another Sc-Fi classic 'The Terminator,' it was hard to say if James Cameron was up to the challenge. After seeing this exceptional film, it's safe to say he was and then some!Pros First and foremost, this film is extremely entertaining from beginning to end. No scene drags. Awesome set and ship designs. The ideas of the first are expanded on. Plenty of suspense and chills. A beautiful score that ranges from subtle and strangely soothing, to fast and heart-pumping. Strong performances from the ensemble cast. Top notch special and visual effects. Some dashes of good humor. The addition of the young girl gives the movie a sweetness lacking in the other films. Having proved himself a fine director with the first 'Terminator,' writer\/director James Cameron does an equally impressive job here. Some great action sequences.Cons Even the greatest movies have flaws and this is no exception. However, the only really annoying one I can find here is that in some shots the ships are too obviously models.Final thoughts Being born in 1984 I wasn't fortunate enough to see this film on the big screen. But this didn't keep me from falling in love with it when I did see it. And today it's just as thoroughly enjoyable as it was the first time I saw it.My rating 5\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 January 2008","score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" Review based on the Special Edition cut The 1979 film 'Alien' was unlike any other Science Fiction film that came before.
