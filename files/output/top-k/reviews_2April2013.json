The Cube concept is simple various people wake up inside the Cube, a 14x14x14 enclosure with various rooms which might lead to a way out. Each room is designed with doors on the walls, a door in the ceiling, and one in the floor. Aside from different colors, the rooms each have a number-marker on them, and they can either contain traps for unsuspecting travelers or are safe-rooms, allowing visitors to pass through them. We get to understand how these people in the film get from room to room by taking a look at their individual characteristics and professions.I love the concept of the Cube. Waking up inside a potential death-trap is frightening and is a concept used in the Saw series multiple times years later. Some of the traps are easily avoidable, as shown when one character slips out from being ensnared (and one unlucky guy gets taken out by the easiest trap to avoid), and others are extremely nasty (a whole room of giant spikes, anyone?). The Cube looks interesting, and the CG added to some of the scenes is simple but effective in showing the perilous traps in some of the rooms. Film buffs will notice that it's just one room being shot time and time again, but it feels like the characters are traveling throughout this larger place, so the effect worked on me.The characters got very annoying very quickly, and by the halfway point through the movie, I wanted them all to die, except for the student in the film, who was the only one not whining or being a complete jerk to any of the others. The actors were OK, but the believability of some of them were spotty, especially the actor who portrayed Quentin who has some severe mood changes that come out of nowhere and requires a pretty good actor to ebb and flow with these changes in subtle ways instead of ham-fisted deliveries and heartless, murderous changes in mood as he had. By the end, you feel somewhat happy for those who made it, but mostly, I was disappointed.The music was sparse, and the one main song that played during lulls in the story was a simple, Friday the 13th-ripoff, horror song using echoing voices, a screeching sample, and a few synth plunks making for an abstract and forgettable song. The sound effects, however, were very satisfying and were required to show the heaviness of the doors and the sharp, dangerous quality of the traps.After viewing this, the logic behind the story doesn't work for me. There are supposed to be 17,576 rooms in this Cube, so how did they all just happen to meet each other after the first day being there? I hated that everyone in the party blindly followed the math student from room to room like she knew what she was doing after seeing numbers on the doors for about 2 minutes. She basically quoted something out of a calculus book to confuse the audience into saying Sure, fine, whatever. Follow her. Oh, and NOTHING IS ANSWERED by the end. Where is the Cube? Who or what is it made by? Why are these people selected to be here? If it were made by blind-architects who didn't care about humans being harmed in various rooms, are they the creators of it with only one guy creating the shell that wasn't related to the rest of the architect- crew?It's a confusing watch for those who care about the story. If you watch it for sci-fi elements alone and the concept of the Cube, you'll get into it on suspense and design alone, but otherwise, there are a lot of unanswered questions that leave you wanting to understand more. Maybe answer why these individuals were selected, much like the victims in Saw are selected. I probably won't get around to watching this again anytime soon. Disappointed.

However, when you add up all the parts, the sum amounts to a weak attempt at ripping off Tarantino. The plot centers on a group of young lads in London who spend their time shoplifting and committing minor crimes to make money. One card shark in their group gets mixed up in a high stakes poker game with Harry Hatchet, known in town as a vicious loan shark who beats the hell out of people who won't pay him back. In what turns out to be a rigged match, the bunch loses half a million pounds and has to pay back the cash before the end of the week. They decide to try to make the money back by pulling off a robbery on some marijuana growers, but this task is complicated by the violence that ensues.If you think that this movie can even compare to a film like Pulp Fiction, prepare to be disappointed. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a British version of the same concept. There is undeniable flair in the directing, but it comes up short in other regards. Most disappointing was the complete absence of character development. Pulp Fiction offered a cast of charismatic and distinct individuals, and as the story progressed I continually learned more about them. The four friends meant to be the protagonists in LS2B were impossible to tell apart, making it hard to connect with any of them. There were no memorable lines or dialogue, and it was hard to actually care what happened to them at all as they blundered around making idiotic mistakes. The other issue I had was Guy Ritchie's occasionally annoying style of editing, with the slow-motion and fast-forwards.

The movie wasn't half bad it just had no point everything that happened practically had no purpose, and when something has no purpose it is just a waste.The acting here is no better than the first, but now that we are all familiar with the Dundee charm, the writers decided to take him back to outback Australia so that we can see the bushman in him. This was suppose to bring in more action like adventure into the whole movie package, but what it just did was fill up so many minutes with unrealistic action scenes that you feel like fast forwarding to the whole thing.The comedy here was out of sync; the whole idea of pairing Dundee with a Colombian drug lord and making the drug lord and his men look like just pure miscreants is not my idea of a well thought out antagonist. The movie lacked a lot of life and the makers decided to do a reverse, the setting started out in New York City then Dundee and Sue went to Australia a familiar turf for Dundee while he dealt with the bad guys.The movie plot is about our duo love birds Dundee (Paul Hogan) and Sue (Linda Kozlowski) who get mixed up with a Colombian drug lord, who had his picture taken when he killed someone by Sue's ex husband. The ex then sent the film to Sue and the drug dealer found out then kidnapped Sue, all for him to find out that Dundee had the film.Now Dundee has to find a way to stay alive and save the love of his life.The movie was not a critical success but it was a huge commercial success, the $15.8 million production cost brought in over $239 million dollars, and it kept the Dundee name on our lips for a while, and making Hogan richer. But then the producers felt like milking the franchise some more so 13 years later in 2001 a new Dundee film was done starring also Hogan and Kozlowski, the new film failed both critically and commercially.So after you are done watching the first Crocodile Dundee you may be tempted to see this misfit, so if you get the chance maybe you should.

The movie from the set go lacks vision, entertainment and if it were a direct to DVD movie it would have made more sense.There was definitely no reason for them to have made this movie, but they did anyway and put it out there for us to see and dislike. This movie was so bad that I couldn't believe that it left the storyboard. Dundee (Paul Hogan) and Sue (Linda Kozlowski) are now together for like 15 years and they have a son named Michael after his father.While living in Australia Sue got a call from her father that she should come and help hold down his office (a newspaper company) in Los Angeles while he attends to other matters. Sue (after Dundee said that he and Michael their son will go along) accepted the offer and moved with her family to Los Angeles, there both father and son were kind of out of it and made the news once for just not getting how things work in America.The antagonist in this one is a phony movie production company, and in this flick we get to see Dundee go undercover. A side story to the whole movie plot has both Dundee and Sue not being married for the whole 15 years they have been together with Sue wanting it but not pushing it and Dundee just not manning up to do the right thing.Trust me after you have read this review just run away from this flick, it is not worth the one hour thirty minutes I put into it. In this movie Hogan is all old, so is Sue and the whole cute lovable couple is not so cute anymore then there are scenes were we see some ladies go gaga for Dundee, I'm no woman but that guy looked old and out of it, so I didn't see the attraction.I felt the makers wanted to see if they could still make some more money off the franchise but this $21 million production only made 39 million in the box office, maybe the DVD sales helped later on, that I don't know but one thing I'm glad for is that, I don't think there will be a Crocodile Dundee IV.www.lagsreviews.com ","genre":null},{"date":"2 April 2013","score":"","review":" This new addition to the Crocodile Dundee franchise is like one of the worst thing that ever happened in 2001, at the end of the film you feel like Paul Hogan should pay you back for seeing this.

Like a ride and a half. Only coming to view it again last year, after last seeing it, I'd say, early 1990, late 89' this movie I've watched a few more times, again the other night, has grown on me. It's undoubtedly a masterpiece that deserves it's place of respect as one of the great movies of all time. Ironically the film was on GO the night after I've video'd it again. That just shows ya, what a classic this is. They don't make films like this anymore. The acting is high calibre. I loved James Caan in this as the hot headed brother who meets his demise in one of three bloody scenes, the most notably of course, that horrifyingly violent scene with the horse head, in the bed of a movie producer refuses to play ball. If you want a favor, like a wrong to be righted, talk to the Godfather, (an unparalleled performance by the late great Marlon Brando, who died penniless at 145 k's-hard to believe) can solve all your problems. Brando in this, just shows ya as in other films like Apocalypse Now, he's just the consummate actor. He must of inspired so many wannabe's. Of course the great discovery of a young talent, who soon would become an acting legend\/role model, was of course Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone who when we first meet him, he's not part of his mafia family. In fact, he somewhat despises it. It's the choice he makes later on, after a near death experience with a loved one, where in his eyes, payback is warranted, even though, he quotes Never personal. He becomes one of them, after brazenly taking out a crooked cop, and the head of another mafia family, responsible for the execution on his father, Don Corleone, (Brando), a tough cookie, surviving five close shots. What resilience this guy has, proving some guys are just lucky, or hard to kill. All the emotions, Pacino shows, nervousness, agitation, as he braces himself to make his first kills, were so believably intense, not overacted, just nice, perfect even. Pacino then vacates to Sicily for a year, to wait for the heat to cool down, where he marries a Sicilian beauty. I couldn't believe Diane Keaton, always terrific, and so good (fine) in this, escaped an Academy award nomination. She was just as good as most of the excellent leads. Watching Caan kick the crap out of his sister's abusive husband, was a guilty viewing pleasure. Caan really impressed me here. I won't tell you the last scene of this movie, but it involves a big fat lie, from Pacino, when asked a one time question by Keaton, which impactfully stayed with me, where if I was Pacino, for me, answering Yes, would be an impossibility. There's some things you don't see coming in The Godfather, and the story takes different paths throughout the film. The cinematography is of course, first rate, and I love the interior shots in the Don's office, and again, here's a mafia film, that has me craving Italian. Although it's occasionally violent, most of it's pretty graphic too, oh that blood so under colored, more orangy red, flowing, it will always stand as the no one mafia film.

It follows the same sort of archetypal set-up in its assembly of a team, and an otherworldly problem only they can handle, despite meddling and objections from government forces.For all intents and purposes, one could safely call it a sort of spiritual remake of Ghostbusters with a focus on Sci-Fi rather than the supernatural.And for the most part, Evolution works as a fun little film.David Duchovny and Orlando Jones star as Arizona college professors Ira Kane and Harry Block. When a meteorite crashes, they go to investigate, taking samples which show something curious- the microbial alien life attached to the meteor appear to be evolving at a highly accelerated rate- millions of years of evolution in mere hours. As the evolution progresses more and more, turning the site of the meteor into a full- fledged, miniature alien atmosphere and forest, government agents arrive. Lead by a former college (Ted Levine) from Ira's military days, the government locks out Kane and Block, and quarantines the area. With them is beautiful government official Alison Reed (Julianne Moore).However, the accelerated evolution begins to cause problems as the alien life begins to escape and threaten the nearby city. Ira and Harry are forced to team with Alison as well as good-natured by oafish local fireman Wayne Grey (Sean William Scott) to battle the alien menace and save the day.The saving graces of the film really fall to two main aspects the chemistry of the cast and the superb direction by Reitman.The cast gives generally good performances and mesh together quite well. Duchovny is a joy as Ira Kane and bring a lot of heart, and the obvious love story with the clumsy but ultimately good Alison Reed is fun to watch play out. Jones is good as Harry Block, though he always struck me as being a bit on the cartoonish side. Sean William Scott is hilarious, but again a little too broad as Wayne Grey. But the four together make an admirable, memorable team and function extremely well together on screen. Once together, they create a great heart to the story, and keep you interested as a viewer. Other performances by the likes of Ted Levine and a cameo by Dan Aykroyd are marvelous.The direction is the other strong piece in the film. Reitman has always been a simple but wonderful visual storyteller, and his direction is first class.However, the film does have a lot of flaws.

Admittedly, that would be true if I had seen every film of his, truth is at the time I had not, and maybe I was rather biased as Hitchcock is my favourite director. While he still is, I do think he has done some bad and disappointing films, but none of them are completely and utterly terrible. Jamaica Inn is perhaps the weakest he did, but I still consider it a disappointing one, considering the talent, rather than terrible. Of course, there are good points, Robert Newton- in a role that couldn't be more different from his performances in Oliver Twist and Treasure Island- is an understated and likable hero, Emlyn Williams is sinister with some droll lines and delivery, there is some nice scenery and the opening shipwreck and ending are exciting.Maureen O'Hara, in her debut(good historical point), is gorgeous to watch but rather shrill and wooden, and most of the supporting cast is stagy. People will remember the character of Pengallen and will love Charles Laughton as him, but I found him so over-the-top with little attempt to reign in that it harmed the film and seemed as though he was acting for a completely different film. I know Laughton can be hammy and subtle at the same time, he was brilliant in The Paradine Case(also directed by Hitchcock), where his role was much more interesting than here, and Mutiny on the Bounty and Witness for the Prosecution(non-Hitchcock films) were the same. Pengallen is a creepy character sure, but rather one-dimensional. The rest of the characters are also sketchily drawn.And as much as I love and admire Hitchcock, it did seem as though his heart wasn't in it, it is an unusually pedestrian directing job and has little of his trademark\/distinctive directing touches. I'd go as far to say that Jamaica Inn didn't seem like a Hitchcock film but more a Laughton one, that's how much he and his character dominated the film and doing it that way it came at the expense of everything else. The editing lacks finesse, in regard to editing Jamaica Inn is the least well-edited, while the dialogue is stilted and the story tediously paced and confused.

It is a heartwarming love story between the psychotic Donald Darko and Gretchen, a real drama, at some points even scary like a horror movie, thinking about the rabbit Frank and Donnie's sleepwalking. It is funny, mysterious and thrilling at the same time.There are also sci-fi elements in it as well as it is a superhero storyGretchenDonnie Darko? What the hell kind of name is that? It's like some sort of superhero or something DonnieWhat makes you think I'm not?The protagonist Donald Darko is excellently played by Jake Gyllenhaal; probably his best performance that he has ever given! His facial expressions of this psychotic person are superb!Donnie Darko has a complex story that you won't understand after the first time of watching it or even the second. It will leave many questions unanswered, however after seeing it several times, you are able to come up with your own interpretation.The whole movie is attended by a more than just on point fitting soundtrack.

Yes it is an epic movie, yes its beautifully narrated, but what struck me most was this movie reminded me of Joseph, son of Jacob in the bible.I mean look at the similarities- Joseph the favorite of Jacob, apple of his fathers eye. Joseph who dreamed about ruling over his brothers. And here we have Andy, the blue eyed genius of the banking sector, who has it all, money, position and a beautiful wife.Joseph is cheated by his brothers and sold into slavery. He is then tempted by his boss's wife, and he resists the temptation in good faith. But anyway he is falsely implicated and sent to prison. Andy gets cheated by his wife and best friend, in a fit of drunken rage Andy entertains the idea of harming then, but quickly sobers up and resists the temptation. Andy also gets falsely implicated.So now we have two innocent men in prison, but both don't let circumstances deter them. Both use their talents where they were placed and grow and rise to new heights. Joseph found favor with the warden and became in charge of the prisoners.

You can also add that the acting in some areas could have use a little work and then not to mention the screenplay. Crocodile Dundee is weak in the story area, but then when you look at the film in general the unbelievable likability of the cast and Michael Dundee's (Paul Hogan) charisma, what you have is a movie that whenever you see it you find yourself smiling all the way through.Crocodile Dundee is a classic Australian comedy film that was set in Outback Australia and New York. Paul Hogan felt the movie will shed more light on the bushman behavior and what he will be like if he was brought to America. The movie was a box office success making like 40 times its production cost (budget $8.8 million, commercial success over $328 million) and received with very high positive reviews.The movie's innocent portrayal of the Dundee character makes it easy to fall in love with the guy and how Dundee manages to make new friends and get many people to like him also seemed like a recipe for a good film, which this movie was.The movie plot features our protagonist Michael Crocodile Dundee, who is popular in Walkabout Creek and the Northern Territory in Australia because of his crocodile hunting skills which left marks on his body.A news reporter from New York Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) heard about his story and went looking for Dundee, found him and then brought him back with her to New York City, where Dundee gets a feel of how life is in the big apple.The movie then transcend into a love story between Dundee and Sue, with a beautiful ending.At the end of this film you will feel relieved and relaxed, and you will be tempted to see what else Dundee will get himself to. The high positive reviews that the movie got and the huge commercial success that it gained in the box office made the producers and Hogan make more sequels. So in 1988 a new Crocodile Dundee movie was released, tagged Crocodile Dundee II, which was less a critical success than the previous film and then 13 years later in 2001 a second sequel was made and tagged Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles.In conclusion this movie is a classic keeper, so I do advise that you get the DVD.www.lagsreviews.com ","genre":null},{"date":"2 April 2013","score":"","review":" Arguably you can say Crocodile Dundee doesn't have the perfect story line.

And this was a risk on director Wong Kar Wai's part - but a risk that was well worth it in many ways. Because the end result is a heavier movie that punches harder and leaves a lasting impression.Not only is the movie driven by an appealing story that is riveting and captivating, but the movie also has a good amount of iconic Hong Kong actors and actresses on the cast list; Leslie Cheung (playing Ou-yang Feng), Tony Leung Chiu Wai (playing the blind swordsman), Bridgette Lin (playing Mu-rong Yin\/Mu-rong Yang), Tony Leung Ka Fai (playing Huang Yao-shi) and of course Maggie Cheung (playing the woman). It is indeed a grand ensemble of acting talents put together in one movie. And especially the performance of Leslie Cheung - whose death was a hard blow to Hong Kong cinema - really put on a marvelous performance in Ashes of Time.The dialogue is good and fluently, keeping the movie well up in pace. And the dialogue is a great core of the movie, so it is an important aspect of the movie, an aspect that just has to work out. And it did!Ashes of Time is also a visually spectacular movie, filmed on location in the harsh deserts of western China, near Mongolia. And the scenery tells a thousand tales in this movie, and it is in itself a major center piece for the movie.If you haven't seen Ashes of Time by now, I can only encourage you to get to it, because this is a very important and defining movie in Hong Kong cinema. This movie is breathtakingly exceptional in many ways.
