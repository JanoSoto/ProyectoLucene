Psycho, though it came out at the same time, is incomparably more powerful. The performances in Peeping Tom are not just unconvincing--they're baffling. I felt like I was watching a bad version of The Blob during the murder scenes. And the structure of the film itself is just is bad. Given that the killer goes so far as to explicitly state the source of his madness and the motivation for his actions (and the force of the plot), you'd think we could skip some of the repeated and overwhelmingly blunt explanatory scenes. Maybe the time could have been used to motivate the attraction of young Ms. Stephens, or to make the character of old Ms. Stephens more than a bald-faced device. I really want to go on here because watching this film has been such a disgusting waste of a couple of hours that this review is the only catharsis I think I'm gonna get tonight. But really, what would be the point. The nonchalance of the police investigator, the aloofness of the analyst, the vacuousness of the actress, the pomposity of the director--let me just say to all those who rated this film highly with the apology that it's just 'aged badly'--these were clichés long before 1960. And what's more, the film is not lacking in shock value because of our jaded 2005 perspective. I still find the violence of Psycho to be involving, kinetic, and brutal, and the murder itself to have a real poignancy. As you see her defend her life, as you see her failing strength, as you look into her eye and realize that her lifeless face will remain flat against the bathroom floor for the rest of what seems like an eternity of a shot... I mean, you FEEL something. And, while Norman Bates may not be the deepest character in the history of cinema, at least he has an air of truth about him. How does one make a film in which the madman killer is EXPLICITLY AWARE of the exact cause of his alleged insanity, capable of explaining it as though he were giving a book report, and not feel a little ashamed. At the very least, this fact should be revealed at, I dunno, an important moment in the plot? A climax? Some kind of turning point? Not just arbitrarily before the film rambles on mercilessly. And seriously, if you're going to make a film strongly featuring a knife, USE IT WELL. The knife imagery in this film is.... it hurts just to think about.

Of course it wasn't a surprise, and I'm sure that upon it's general release, there were one or two executives at Paramount Pictures that wished they hadn't even bothered making the movie in the first place - and the reason for that being is simply some movies should be left to bask in their own glory without being bastardised and diluted with one or more sequels. Grease 2 is one such example.Whether you want to compare Grease 2 with the original or take an unbiased view and appraise it on it's own, nothing can hide the fact this really is a terrible movie. So where did Grease 2 go wrong? For one, the entire movie script is more or less a rehash of the original (albeit in some instances, the male\/female roles have been reversed to disassociate this from being a straight remake). Take the main love angles in both movies for example in the first movie, you had the cool kid (Travolta) falling for the square new-kid-in-town girl (Newton-John), and in the sequel, it's the same, but the roles are gender reversed. Originality seemed lost on the script-writers, and this was further evident during the whole movie, especially during the end-of-school-year carnival where the 'square' kid (Michael) is finally accepted - a scene that's blatantly ripped off from the original Grease.The original Grease cast never won awards for their acting abilities, but compared to those relative unknowns (back in 1982) who secured the leading roles in the sequel, they make John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John seem like Oscar winners because their acting abilities ranged from 'acceptable' to 'dire', with the latter description perfectly summing up the majority of the cast of Grease 2. Moreover, the injection of old, supporting actors from the first movie (Frenchy and Eugene especially) seemed questionable too. Granted, teachers were understandable returnees, but Frenchy returning to Rydell High two years after she left to supposedly enter 'beauty school' (and dropped out almost immediately as her character explained in the first movie) and, like the Eugene character, had already graduated. Why were they even in the movie, other than to make an association between the two films? To give the casting people credit, at least for the second movie they hired actors who, at least, looked like teenagers which couldn't be said about the first Grease.Whereas the soundtrack is what the original will be best remembered for, the songs used in Grease 2 were a lot to be desired. With the exception of the terrific opening number (Back To School Again performed by the Four Tops) and Who's That Guy? (with the former being the best song from both movies IMO), the quality of the songs matched the acting ability on show. Prowlin', Do It For Our Country and Reproduction were all appalling and the worst on offer; Cool Rider and the sexual innuendo laced, Score Tonight were passable as songs (even if the accompanying dance scenes were so bad, they were actually hilarious - see Ms Pfeiffer strut to Cool Rider and you'll see what I mean); Charades is actually a lovely ballad, or it would've been if someone other than Mr Caulfield had sung it, yet it was quite 'dark' and featured in something of a noir-ish scene that didn't really belong in the movie. The rest of this rather short soundtrack is made up with what can only be described as uninteresting fillers.As for the characters themselves, it seems the 'Pink Ladies' have become the most dominant gang at Rydell High because those characters are the most strongest, especially the roles of Stephanie (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Paulette (Lorna Luft). Despite the fact that the 'T-Birds' epitomised everything cool in the original, they seem to have turned into a group of geeks in this movie. Adrian Zmed (Johnny) and Christopher McDonald (Goose) are certainly no John Travolta and Jeff Conaway, neither were their characters. Didi Conn reprised the exact same role she had in the first movie as Frenchy, someone present in the movie to introduce the new kid to the ways of the school and what it took to be 'cool'. Unfortunately, in Grease 2, we'd seen it all before and her character seemed 'tired'. To their credit, Michelle Pfeiffer and Maxwell Caulfield played their characters well, and unlike the majority of the cast, they did seem 'believable'.

Of course it wasn't a surprise, and I'm sure that upon it's general release, there were one or two executives at Paramount Pictures that wished they hadn't even bothered making the movie in the first place - and the reason for that being is simply some movies should be left to bask in their own glory without being bastardised and diluted with one or more sequels. Grease 2 is one such example.Whether you want to compare Grease 2 with the original or take an unbiased view and appraise it on it's own, nothing can hide the fact this really is a terrible movie. So where did Grease 2 go wrong? For one, the entire movie script is more or less a rehash of the original (albeit in some instances, the male\/female roles have been reversed to disassociate this from being a straight remake). Take the main love angles in both movies for example in the first movie, you had the cool kid (Travolta) falling for the square new-kid-in-town girl (Newton-John), and in the sequel, it's the same, but the roles are gender reversed. Originality seemed lost on the script-writers, and this was further evident during the whole movie, especially during the end-of-school-year carnival where the 'square' kid (Michael) is finally accepted - a scene that's blatantly ripped off from the original Grease.The original Grease cast never won awards for their acting abilities, but compared to those relative unknowns (back in 1982) who secured the leading roles in the sequel, they make John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John seem like Oscar winners because their acting abilities ranged from 'acceptable' to 'dire', with the latter description perfectly summing up the majority of the cast of Grease 2. Moreover, the injection of old, supporting actors from the first movie (Frenchy and Eugene especially) seemed questionable too. Granted, teachers were understandable returnees, but Frenchy returning to Rydell High two years after she left to supposedly enter 'beauty school' (and dropped out almost immediately as her character explained in the first movie) and, like the Eugene character, had already graduated. Why were they even in the movie, other than to make an association between the two films? To give the casting people credit, at least for the second movie they hired actors who, at least, looked like teenagers which couldn't be said about the first Grease.Whereas the soundtrack is what the original will be best remembered for, the songs used in Grease 2 were a lot to be desired. With the exception of the terrific opening number (Back To School Again performed by the Four Tops) and Who's That Guy? (with the former being the best song from both movies IMO), the quality of the songs matched the acting ability on show. Prowlin', Do It For Our Country and Reproduction were all appalling and the worst on offer; Cool Rider and the sexual innuendo laced, Score Tonight were passable as songs (even if the accompanying dance scenes were so bad, they were actually hilarious - see Ms Pfeiffer strut to Cool Rider and you'll see what I mean); Charades is actually a lovely ballad, or it would've been if someone other than Mr Caulfield had sung it, yet it was quite 'dark' and featured in something of a noir-ish scene that didn't really belong in the movie. The rest of this rather short soundtrack is made up with what can only be described as uninteresting fillers.As for the characters themselves, it seems the 'Pink Ladies' have become the most dominant gang at Rydell High because those characters are the most strongest, especially the roles of Stephanie (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Paulette (Lorna Luft). Despite the fact that the 'T-Birds' epitomised everything cool in the original, they seem to have turned into a group of geeks in this movie. Adrian Zmed (Johnny) and Christopher McDonald (Goose) are certainly no John Travolta and Jeff Conaway, neither were their characters. Didi Conn reprised the exact same role she had in the first movie as Frenchy, someone present in the movie to introduce the new kid to the ways of the school and what it took to be 'cool'. Unfortunately, in Grease 2, we'd seen it all before and her character seemed 'tired'. To their credit, Michelle Pfeiffer and Maxwell Caulfield played their characters well, and unlike the majority of the cast, they did seem 'believable'.

The acting is remarkable. Angelina Jolie is definitely worthwhile, and Oscar worthy. As far as technical film processes go, this is an excellent film. Even if you hate the film's story, you have to give it credit for it's acting and directing. James Mangold is highly underrated, and props to Winona Ryder for finding him. I doubt anyone could have made a better piece of art. The transitions between scenes where Susanna fades between reality and something else is remarkable and clever. There are many scenes in which Winona and Angelina have absolute chemistry. I know that this word is usually used in romantic situations in film, but here it is used because you can feel the relationship that Susanna and Lisa have. And there are three distinct relationships the two have as the movie goes on fascination, admiration, and hatred. With every scene that the two are in together you get chills in the way they react (and it's not just because Angelina does such a remarkable job as someone who is terrifying). Not to discredit Winona's job. In the director's cut James Mangold talks about Winona being a silent actress. This is very present in this film. She is so powerful even when she is not talking. Her facial expressions are so in tune and seem to put the view right inside her head. But although these two dominate the movie, and are very good, other actresses should be acknowledged too. Brittany Murphy is very impressive as well as Whoppi (as always).What seems, to me, though, to be most critical in wondering whether to pick this one up at Blockbuster or not is this if the mentally ill scare you, this film will probably weird you out and you won't like it at all. What is most important about this film is it's relatablility. One can easily relate to the Winona Ryder character, especially if your teenage years were full of angst and indecisiveness. People who, remarkably, believe they have a grasp of life, and understand it in full will not want to see this movie, because they will get frustrated with how deep Susanna involves herself in pointless matters. I, on the other hand, and those who like this film, will find that Susanna is looking for the answers to questions we face everyday. That having been said (I assume all those who don't want to involve themselves in a psychological downer have stopped reading), I can move on to discuss the wide variety of philosophical questions this movie delves into. I know a lot of teenage girls relate with Susanna. This character, for them, IS them. And the questions Susanna asks throughout the movie (Am I really crazy?, What is it to be normal?) are ones those girls ask continually. Who am I? is a question people have to either spend lots of time trying to answer, deny that it exists, or leave it alone. This film is to help focus on what it really is to be sane, human, and undeniably something. There is a line in which Whoppi Goldberg says, You are not crazy! You're a lazy, self- indulgent, little girl who is driving herself crazy! Anyone who knows what this statement means will enjoy this film.I feel there does need to be a paragraph dedicated to Angelina Jolie's performance. Although she is an idol because of her beauty and the tabloids love her, Angelina does not get enough credit for her acting. I don't believe for a second that any other actress in Hollywood could pull off such a performance. Angelina really becomes Lisa, and is very scary, yet likable in this regard. She has been compared to Jack Nicholson, with very good reason. There is not another female counterpart that could have pulled such a profound display.

This seems not to be fully appreciated by everybody. It is obviously directed towards younger audiences with the songs and the characters, which seems to tear out all the interest from people as they are watching this, while they ask themselves What am I watching? Let me assure you, if you can see past the child-ness, you may truly get a chance to appreciate this film. And let me tell you, you will like it.The story for The Lion King is incredibly complex for a Disney story.Mufasa is the ruler of Pride Rock, and after he passes away, Simba will be king. Mufasa does pass away after a stampede caused by his uncle, Scar, and Scar convinces Simba it was all his doing. Simba flees the kingdom in search of a new life, until he is called back by his friend, Nala.The Lion King is not the first movie to deal with romance, but one of the first movies to deal with guilt and jealousy. The Lion King is sort of a child's first drama as I like to think of it. Dramatic as it is, The Lion King is easy to pay attention to, unlike most dramas. Perhaps many other dramas could have taken after that.I do believe that it was based on Hamlet, but even if it did copy Hamlet, it did a very impressive job.This will entertain for generations.9\/10Good Dramatic, well-drawn, good songs and funnyBad Well, some people might think that they're too cool to watch it.

However this has to be the most unrealistic film of the Halloween series. Halloween II seems to have had a major number of flaws. To start out the window that Michael falls out of in the pre credits is different from the one he fell out of at the end of the first film. Afew minutes later Dr. Loomis claims that he shot Michael six times when it was actually a total of seven. Later on Michael makes his way to the hospital where Laurie is in her convalescence from her previous encounter from the masked fiend. The hospital is where most of the goof ups are obviously noticed. Haddonfield Memorial must be the most laid back hospital in the world. What do we notice about this hospital. Well here are a few examples There seems to be only one doctor and he performs his duties while under the influence. Laurie might as well of had Michael work on her. There are only 4 nurses and 1 security guard. It also seems to be legal for paramedics to smoke some weed in the break room. It's no wonder why Michael was able to sneak in undetected and dispatch nearly everyone in the hospital. The hospital seems to be so quiet that two staff members get a chance to fraternize with each other in the facility's therapy tub. Well the hot tub scene may be the most memorable scene of the entire Halloween series. Yes, the actress who portrayed nurse Karen sure had a fine body for the early '80's. I wish I could work at a hospital with such a lovely nurse. It's a shame her demise had to be so gruesome and agonizing. After all her it wasn't her idea to go mess around in the hot tub. Maybe she got it that way for picking such a crude and obnoxious jerk for a boyfriend. She should've chosen Jimmy instead. While Michael is having his way at the hospital, the police and Dr. Loomis are trying to figure out where exactly Michael Myers may be. Here is where we have some more flaws. The Haddonfield Police seem to be just as inept as the medical staff at the hospital. Not only did they not question Laurie about what happened, they didn't even think about Myers being in the hospital at all. If a suspect has been shot the hospital would be an obvious choice to look, or at least inform the hospital to put out an APB as well as other locations. As we near the climax of the film Dr. Loomis is on his way back to Smith Grove due to orders from the governor. While he is in the marshal's car the nurse tells him the shocking news that Laurie Strode is Michael's sister and that's why he came home to Haddonfield. Loomis forces the Marshal to return to Haddonfield in an attempt save Laurie and stop Michael.Well this is where most of us thought the series at least with Michael Myers was officially over. Dr. Loomis decides to blow up the room that he and Laurie are hiding in due to fact the Loomis opened up the the oxygen tanks. This is when we assume that both the doctor and his seemingly supernatural patient burn to death. Obviously, when Halloween 4 comes out we learn that both of them have miraculously survived the inferno. If anybody is wondering about the third installment, it's a completely different story from the other films in the Halloween franchise. Despite the film taking place on the same night from the original film, Halloween II had it's fair share scares and suspense to make it a very respectable slasher film. For anybody who is into the old school horror icons such as Michael and Jason from the Friday the 13th films, I'd definitely recommend watching this one if you haven't seen this one yet.

Sure it may get a bit silly in the 2nd half, but it's still quite fun, and it's quite underrated as well!, plus i found the ending to be really cool!. Thankfully David Schwimmer, is at least bearable, and it has some cool action scenes as well!, plus it's quite creative at times as well!. The scenery is really beautiful, and the finale is quite exciting!, however the villains(Pirates), had barely anything to do, and therefore, didn't find them menacing, it's basically a Romance Comedy, but it's quite a good one at that!. This wasn't too popular with critics, however i really enjoyed it, it had likable characters and 2 very charismatic leads with Ford and Heche, and there chemistry is what really makes it work, i highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great. Ivan Reitman does a great job here, with awesome camera work, great angles, and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. The Acting is wonderful!.

Like the others, Aladdin has songs, detailed animation, and a good versus evil setting. It is pretty predictable, and has a main character who usually falls in love with some pretty girl.One of Aladdins many strong points was the talented voice acting of Robin Williams. The ability to portray so many different and silly characters that the genie does is one of the best parts in the movie. It is similar to how Eddie Murphy got to play Mushu in Mulan.Something else remarkable about this film was the storyline. The storyline starts off with Jafar (the villain) trying to find the Magic Lamp which will give him three wishes. Jafar finds the Cave of Wonders, in which the lamp is hidden. However, the cave won't let just anybody in. The only person who can enter the cave is a street rat named Aladdin. Meanwhile, Aladdin is stealing a loaf of bread and running away from the guards. Of course, this means a song would be involved. So, while singing a-long with the guards, Aladdin is stealing a loaf of bread because he has no money. Another plot that is happening at this time, is Jasmine's story. Jasmine has to marry a prince, but doesn't seem to like any of the ones her father picked out for her. The three character's quests and stories later merge together to make the main storyline. However, in the storyline there is one small flaw. How come Aladdin is the only person who can enter the Cave of Wonders? That's what I have been wondering. Is it just to make a storyline?Anyways, ignoring that detail, I wanted to say that it seems like Aladdin has a little something for everyone. It has action for the little boys. Girls may like the romance. Little children will probably like the singing and the fact that it's a cartoon. Finally, dads will probably enjoy the fact that Robin Williams is doing the voice acting in this film. (My dad does anyways, and requested to put that in there.)

It seemed too much like a Make-A-Wish story. If it was, no one worked for anything, they just got it because it made others feel good. Now if it had been billed as a Make-A-Wish story, than I guess it would have been pretty good.

As someone who is deeply interested in vampires and a big fan of the Dracula novel, I have been dying to see this film for years and when I first saw it about eighteen months ago it quite simply blew me away. This is the definitive film version of Bram Stoker's novel, and if anyone is not stunned by the magnificence of this film or the phenomenally good performance of Gary Oldman in the title role, then I think they should be checked for a pulse. This film left me literally speechless, and compared to the Christopher Lee versions of the 1950s, '60s and '70s, it stands up as being the most accurate and faithful screen adaptation of the novel that has ever been made. So all in all, this film is the one that any fan of the novel should see first, and I think once they have seen the Lee versions they will agree that this film is the very best and the most faithful to Stoker's novel.To start with, Gary Oldman is the personification of the Dracula portrayed in the novel. Apart from looking almost exactly how the centuries-old vampire is described in the novel, his vocal and bodily performance is so unbelievably good that it will leave you transfixed. He wonderfully combines Dracula's charm, grace, sinister aspects, desire for revenge against God, lust for the women who surround themselves around Johnathan Harker, Van Helsing, Arthur Holmwood and Dr. Seward, and of course his thirst for human blood. He also portrays the lover who has lost his beloved to a remarkably good degree, and his superb acting of the scenes on the bed with Mina Harker brings a lump to the throat and a tear to the eye. It is often said that an actor's performance is electric, but even that isn't enough to describe the brilliance of Oldman as Dracula. Stunning, wonderful, or magnificent are closer to the mark when describing Oldman's portrayal. His sinister exclamation of Dracula's famous quote, Listen to them, the children of the night, what sweet music they make is particularly outstanding.The other characters from the novel - Johnathan Harker (the estate agent who first meets Dracula), Mina Harker (his bride and the object of Dracula's affections), Lucy Westenra (Mina's friend), Arthur Holmwood (Lucy's husband-to-be), Quincey Morris (a Texan), Dr. Seward (a medical man) and Van Helsing (a professor and part-time vampire hunter) - are also brilliantly portrayed and given enough screen time to allow their characters to be developed as much as they need to be. Keanu Reeves is an excellent Johnathan Harker, sufficiently afraid while in Dracula's castle and determined enough to kill him back in England; Winona Ryder is a fantastic Mina\/Elisabeth; Sadie Frost is a superb sweet, naive and flirtatious Lucy; Arthur, Seward and Quincey are portrayed well and make excellent vampire hunters; and Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing is ten times better than the Peter Cushing version and a million miles closer to the eccentric genius portrayed in the novel. These characters, and Dracula himself, are portrayed beautifully and accurately in James V. Hart's stunning script, which adheres quite closely to Stoker's novel, including extracts from the novel and sufficient explanations to allow those who have not read the novel to understand and follow the plot.The superb direction by Francis Ford Coppola is beyond any faults, and his handling of the bed scenes between Dracula and Mina is enough to bring out all the raw emotions and tears among the audience, let alone between the two characters themselves! The script is pure excellence and the prologue about Vlad the Impaler losing his bride (Elisabeth) after a battle between his people (the Transylvanians) and the Turks, then in his grief denying God's existence and avenging her death by becoming a vampire (i.e. Dracula) is superb and brings all the beliefs that Dracula was partly inspired by the real Vlad the Impaler bursting into a new light, and makes Dracula a sympathetic and tragic character, instead of the charming but deadly ladies' man as portrayed by Lee. The use of Romanian language in the prologue and later in the film adds authenticity to a beautiful and tear-jerking adaptation of the novel.The music is one of the very best as heard in a film, and in places is so utterly fantastic it could almost be an undiscovered Beethoven's symphony. The scenery and costumes are beyond criticism, and offer a real sense of Transylvanian and English culture and tradition respectively. Dracula's red cloak, trailing behind him like a sea of blood, and the gold dragon on his chest (suggesting he is the dragon to Van Helsing's St. George) is wonderfully designed. The make-up of the elderly Dracula is sufficiently corpse-like yet alive enough to suggest quite rightly that Dracula is caught between life and death by his vampire's existence. The half-man, half-wolf and the half-man, half-bat versions of Dracula are wonderfully created with make-up and special effects (bearing in mind this film was made in 1992) and the death of Dracula at the end (his throat slashed by Johnathan Harker and his heart impaled by Quincey Morris) is beautifully written, acted and directed, and the scene where he reverts back to the young Vlad the Impaler and is finally allowed to die with Mina (the reincarnation of Elisabeth - hence his affections towards her) next to him is so tear-jerkingly wonderful it leaves a lasting impression on the viewer.Stunning. Truly stunning. There's nothing more to be said about it.

I understand the poetic license that artists take to make a good story, and I am willing to grant that license. However, I feel that, when tallied, this film's erroneous statements go far beyond the pale of poetry and cross into the realm of propaganda and silliness. It's the difference between The Battle Hymn of the Republic vs. Charlie Daniels In America. The former inspires me, the latter is a joke.Another aspect of the movie that bothered me was its disconcerting take on morals. It begins, fittingly, with someone being mocked for obeying a rule. Henry Fonda, a murderer just out on parole, berates a truck driver for obeying a rule that prohibits him from giving rides. What if Fonda had hijacked him, would the truck driver be a prude or an idiot? In the next scene, God gets the ax. Fonda comes across a disillusioned vagabond, the family's ex-parson. He brags that his sermons were emotional hype and confesses that he liked to sleep with the women that got caught up in the spirit at his meetings. Now, he says, he has lost hope. He does not state this as a fault, so much as it is confusing to him why the spirit has left him. Strangely, this later state of the preacher is looked upon by Fonda as being clairvoyant. Everything that happens in The Grapes of Wrath happens within the context of morality being a relative thing, certainly one devoid of divine appointment. Everything from lying to murder is excusable if done by the right people or for the right reasons. A few examples - Upon seeing Fonda out of prison, most of his family is hoping he broke out. His parole comes as a disappointment.- The murder he was sentenced to seems irrelevant.- The sharecroppers are willing to kill the owners of the land to stop them from evicting them (they don't because it won't do no good not because it would be morally reprehensible).- (slight spoiler) Fonda murders another man for murdering his friend, and Fonda's mother not only excuses the murder without knowing what her son's motive was, but offers to cover it up by hiding her son.I, personally, have a hard time rooting for such protagonists.

There is not a single group or individual (with any means, that is) helping any of these people, esp. children? Where are the soup kitchens, churches, etc..? The premise of the script is built upon this nonsense. Quick research into the Great Depression will reveal a contrary reality. People where mostly very kind and helpful to each other. It's how we survived as a country. Many other countries turned to anarchy.Its opinion of progress is very cockeyed. The tractors are pictured as giant evil job gobblers. In reality, modernization made it so poor people could get better paying jobs and live a much higher quality of life.Its opinion of what role religion plays in American life is cockeyed.Its opinion of land ownership is cockeyed.

The editing to start with is unbelievable, its jumpy, completely irregular and completely inhibits your viewing of the film. I know this film was made in the sixties but thats no excuse. Some great films were made in this time AND THIS FILM Definitely ISN'T ONE OF THEM. The acting is poor and the continuity is non existent. Not so good. lifeistricky ","genre":"Crime, Drama"}]
