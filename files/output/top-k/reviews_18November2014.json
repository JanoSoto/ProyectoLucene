When the napalm hits that tree-line you know you aren't in for your typical Vietnam war film no, this is something much more, a story of prejudice and curiosity which will take captain Willard (Martin sheen) into a world of despair and one that will question his confidence in normal civilization, and raises the question 'what will he find when he reaches Col. Kurtz' ?The dialogue in this film is just great, it has one of the most haunting monologues in film history acted perfectly by the legend Marlon Brando. It includes narration by martin sheen that takes us on a journey through the jungle, although we really don't know much about the characters' backgrounds apart form colonel Kurtz, since we hear first hand his dossier throughout the first half of the film. The cinematography is great and will deeply absorb you into the plot, this is particularly evident when we finally see kurtz, we do not see his face much just glimpses and so in the few parts when we clearly see, it is a frightening face.We get a true portrayal of war here, the grit, the horrors and the damage it caused to not only the Vietnamese people but that damage it caused to the American soldiers. This does not make war look fun, like some other movies nor does it follow the cliché agenda of a hero and a villain, we do not know who the villain is nor who the hero is. If you go into this expecting just a fast paced war film then do not watch you will be disappointed go watch fury instead, this film will take you on a journey that will be impossible to forget.

A huge flat out ten. It has incredible performances, tons of action, a great story, incredible actors and memorable moments for an action film. It is in a league of its own in the genre and could be considered an action epic. Now I have seen the film dozens of times and I'm entertained by it every time but eventually it does have to wear thin so its dropped down a tiny peg for me and now sits comfortable forever with a solid 9. Con Air is perfect in its simplistic concept. A war hero accidentally kills a man defending himself and his wife, spends many years in prison and when he is moments from being released he inadvertently ends up being the last hope in stopping a group of terrifying ruthless villains. The best thing to come out of Con Air is the characterizations of the villains. There are so many great actors and performances that it would take a skilled film maker to make sure no one gets lost in the shuffle and everyone gets their moment. Ironically I felt watching it this time that the most underdeveloped character is actually the hero himself. We know he's a former soldier, trained to kill, and adores his family. He's soft spoken but steadfast in his morals. Outside of that we don't know a lot about him. Its almost like he's not the focus of the film. Regardless, each scene, each moment, the music, the characters...everything falls together in one of the most entertaining films in this genre.Nicholas Cage was flying high at this point coming from his Oscar win and having a truly epic trilogy of action films in 96\/97 with this film, The Rock and Face Off. This was Cage at his best in my books. He is understated but full of strength as Cameron Poe and you just root for this guy because much like Bruce Willis in Die Hard, he is literally in the wrong place at the wrong time and just wants to get home. The rest of the good guys are also very good. John Cusack is terrific as the fast talking Vince Larkin and the scenes towards the end with him and Cage are just awesome. Colm Meaney is also a lot of fun as Duncan Malloy who is constantly at odds with Cusack and ends up being the butt of a lot of...damage. Now how can I talk meaningfully to this incredible cast of villains. First of all John Malkovich as always is stunning. No one does villainy like this guy and his portrayal of Cyrus The Virus is untouchable. He is perfect period. But that doesn't take away from the truly outstanding performances from Ving Rhames, MC Gainey, Dave Chappelle (and I can't stand this guy normally), Nick Chinlund and Danny Trejo. Now some of them have very small parts but Rhames, Chinlund and Gainey are truly fantastic. And then you have in my opinion was the best performance ever from Steve Buscemi as Garland Greene. This performance haunts me because he does it so well. He is truly twisted and just gives off this aura that is sick and twisted. Entire films could be based just on his character alone.This is truly one of those films where everything just works. Director Simon West knows action. He is actually one of my top action director favourites because of films like this The Mechanic and The Expendables 2. I think he just is truly a fan of action films because he seems to have a style in his direction that is reminiscent of classic actioners like Die Hard and Rambo and films like that. There is nothing that you won't find in Con Air if you love the genre. Car chases, air-plane scenes, gun fights, cops and robbers, explosions, crashes, hand to hand combat...this film literally has everything. But the reason it is so great is because it has all that AND amazing performances AND a terrific story too. If you haven't seen this you are truly missing out and if you have its time to watch it again.

This is one of those movies that I had seen years ago when it first came out. I'm not sure if I had simply forgotten or I hadn't realized how great this one was because at the time I was a dumb teenager but it really is terrific. The premise is pretty simple. A single mom (Meg, played by Jodie Foster) and her vulnerable daughter (Sarah, Kristen Stewart) move into a new house. The house comes with a panic room, a place where you can hide in should anything go wrong. A bunch of bad guys (Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam and Jared Leto) break into the place, so Sarah and her daughter hide in the room. Trouble is, that's where the villains are trying to get to.There are many smart choices in the movie, one of which is to keep the cast small. For most of the movie we only get 5characters and that allows us to get to know them. You feel like you're inside the movie, studying everyone and trying to get the edge on them by observing their mannerisms and gaging their personality, just as the people on either side of the panic room are doing. While you're getting inside the characters' heads, a strong sense of urgency builds. I'm no criminal, but I know that with a robbery, you have to get in and get out quick. The longer the plot drags on, the worse it's going to get because you increase the chances of something going wrong and of you getting caught. On the side of our heroes, there are some complications that build too, so you've got Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart's characters that want to get out asap, and the thieves that want to get in. Everyone is either trying to find a way to trick the other party into letting them in or out of the room, or trying to find a way around the big door that's separating everyone, or trying to force someone else to do it for them. Because the characters are intelligent, they're always trying something new and it kept me guessing as to what was going to happen next. It's really satisfying to see a movie where people act logically; always trying to sneak past each other's defenses (both physical and mental\/emotional) and you'll constantly be surprised by the new elements introduced. Panic Room is a terrific thriller that really cleverly uses its location, creates genuine thrills and exciting feelings of paranoia and claustrophobia too.

The snow dome ball is then dropped and the story begins.After a short documentary on Charlie Kane has been shown the men at the magazine begin to sought after the meaning of his final utterance.Charlie Kane's parents inherited a mine which happened to be rich in gold. His parents sign the bill to Walter parks thatcher which gives him the authority to raise Charles in extreme luxury. This scene is very sad indeed the boy is reluctant to leave his parents but in the end succumbed to Mr. thatcher and sets away with him we see a close up of Charlie's sled which then becomes neglected in the snow. That is a huge scene and a sad one at that. The investigative reporter Thompson triggers every flashback by questioning his old alcoholic wife Susan Alexander Kane, his old wilting friend Jedediah Leland and his rich associate Mr. Bernstein.We learn about his beginning in the publishing business from Mr. Bernstein from when he took over the inquirer to the marriage of the presidents niece. When the flashback is over Bernstein says maybe rosebud was something he lost, Kane was a man who lost everything he had At this point we are intrigued to learn more about Mr Kane who seems to be an enigma.The story then builds character depth for Charlie and the rest making us feel a lot along the way, i can say that the cinematography is a huge part in this and the way Welles acts as Charlie Kane is exceptional, the supporting cast are great too Joseph Cotten puts in a key performance. latter stages of the film will now be explored.The penultimate flashback about old Charlie Kane and the rockiness of his relationship with Susan, she sits alone in Xanadu playing jigsaw puzzles to pass the time feeling lonely and bored the subsequent shot, she begins to argue with Charlie saying that despite having all these items bought for her none of them mean anything implying Charlie has bribed her into making her think he is a generous man who cares and making her love him, the next shot shows Susan leaving Charlie it then backs out of the flashback to Susan telling Thompson that she advises him to speak to Charlie's butler at Xanadu he sets off to find him.The final flashback is triggered by Raymond the butler, we see a wonderfully acted scene by Orson Welles trash up the room throwing everything down in it's path bed sheets, shelves, mirrors, everything you could think of apart from one thing the Small glass snow dome, Charlie picks this up and says rosebud we know from this shot that because it stopped the crazy outburst it is something extremely sentimental to him but at this point we are still not sure exactly what rosebud means. The members of the magazine are reunited with Thompson at Xanadu which is completely full of statues and other material objects purchased by Charlie Kane, They ask Thompson did you find out what rosebud means ? he responds no i didn't, i don't think a single word can describe a single mans life my guess is that rosebud was something he lost or something he couldn't get, anyway i don't think it would have explained anything. The famous shot of the camera slowly making it's way past all of the junk to the sled he once had as a child, we here the butler say burn all this useless junk the sled is then thrown into the fire where we see the close up of 'Rosebud' the paint then curls and the film ends.This film gives me a huge bone chilling feeling every time i watch it to the final scene where we see rosebuds meaning it fills us with deep sadness and huge empathy towards Charles foster Kane, we found out that rosebud symbolised innocence, a memory of a once normal childhood playing in the snow, youth and happiness. This film tells us that although you can be the richest man in America you can still be extremely lonely, happiness can not be fulfilled purely by money nor can it buy love or friendship there is a famous line in the film where Charles Kane says You know Mr. Bernstein if i hadn't have been really rich i might have been a really great man Charles Kane just wanted to lead a happy life like most of us.

Unfortunately for them, two bumbling buffoons (Steve James & Tom Wright) have conjured up a voodoo spell to bring Bernie back to life. It backfires when they mess up the spell and Bernie can only move when he hears music. Meanwhile, a company security officer (Bostwick) is after everything as well. This is the 3rd time I've seen this movie! That makes no sense, I know! I always feel that maybe I'm missing something. As a fan of the original movie, I've always been bemused about why they decided to go through with this movie. I know Andrew McCarthy's burgeoning, 80's career had hit the skids at this juncture, but it was an awful decision. Look. I really liked the original and I know it was a surprise hit. I don't think anyone clamored for a sequel though. Everything that made the original work so well is nowhere to be found here. It seems so forced and contrived that it's not even funny. Not only that, there was no need for a sequel! Everything was solved in the original! There is usually a hint of sorts that a sequel will commence. I didn't sense that in the first movie. It's filled with plenty of cringe worthy slapstick that is not funny in the slightest. The only thing I was mildly amused at were the gags at the morgue. They try to repeat the formula of the original, but it feels corny. There are only so many things you can do with a dead person before it gets stagnant. Not to mention the voodoo thing is very stupid. Jonathan Silver and Andrew McCarthy's act has worn very thin. McCarthy's cocky persona was fun in the original, but it's overbearing in the sequel. He mugs his way through a lot of it and doesn't seem too inspired. Silver is dull as the straight man. The chemistry they shared is gone.

Barry Bostwick is fine in his role. Steve James & Tom Wright do fine as the idiots, but they weren't very funny. Thank god they had the smarts to stop here!

I choose movies to watch according to IMDb ratings and are normally very reliable. This is one time I have been let down.

I can totally understand why many people hate it, or do not like it. It is depressing, and there's no real finish or arc for the characters.That being said, the one thing that stood out for me that nobody has mentioned, is that even Woody Allen didn't like the characters. I think that was his point. As some have pointed out, the characters are pretentious, self absorbed upper middle class yuppies with no real problems. I think what Woody Allen was doing, as was the case in Manhattan, was giving us a glimpse into that sort of liberal elitist upper crest society, where these characters in particular are pseudo-intellectuals and wannabe artists, who create their own problems that really don't mean anything.This would explain the introduction of Pearl, the fathers new fiancé. Pearl is great. Amidst all the self absorbed, elitist syrup the characters espouse relentlessly, Pearl emerges as almost a down to earth, working class gal.The family goes out to a play with their father and Pearl, and later while eating dinner, they are discussing this play. The daughters and their yuppy husbands are over analyzing the play to literally a puke inducing pretentiousness...and Pearl just chimes in One character was a squealer, the other wasn't. I liked the character who wasn't a squealer. Thats all there is to it! They try to argue with her with more pretentious drivel, and Pearl simply states again The message I got was dont Squeal. Later, Pearl is dancing to dixieland music with everybody, and knocks over a vase on accident, and the one daughter calls her an animal. Towards the end of the movie, Pearl ends up saving the daughters life with CPR after she nearly drowns. She seems almost ungrateful. Its as if this fmaily is so elitist, they look down on Pearl as some sort of inferior.Pearl is a down to earth, normal, lovable older woman with some spunk, which is why the father fell in love with her. Throughout the movie, we see how dominating and obnoxious their mother is. She is pretty much the reason the family is dysfunctional, with her delusional, relentless whining, and quiet yet aggressive behavior. On top of that, she was a successful interior designer, and her 3 daughters are all artsy intellectuals...and you can see why a character like the father is just overwhelmed with them all, and falls in love with a very grounded, relatively simple woman, Pearl.I think it was Woodys purpose to make you feel burdened or overwhelmed by the characters, the mother...hell, almost feel completely alienated, only to suddenly find yourself relating to Pearl when she arrives.Another scene that kind of highlights the pretentiousness of the characters, one of the girls husbands is speaking into a tape recorder about marxism and communism, hinting that he is a supporter of such ideology. Which, again, is woody making a small point. Because here you have this wealthy, yuppy guy, embracing the concept of marxism.For anyone who grew up or lived around New York in the 60's and 70's, that was always one of those ironies...wealthy yuppy types preaching about marxism and communism. Its sort of a hypocrisy Woody Allen often points out in many of his movies.To summarize, this was a serious movie that essentially criticizes the upper class liberal crowd, as Woody has done in many of his movies. In Manhattan, Woody narrates in the film at the end about how its full of people with no real problems, so they create them. That is essentially the characters in this film.

While directors like Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie had made the genre fresh again in the 90's, they had inspired many others who copied their unique style of film-making to a much lesser degree, creating many films which ranged from merely being bad (e.g. Best Laid Plans, The Big Hit) or were completely morally bankrupt (e.g. The Boondock Saints, Natural Born Killers). Because of this, it was easy to cynically prejudge many crime films that were coming out in that era. Occasionally however, you have exceptions to this rule which manage to stand out on their own and not fall into the trappings of crime films of that era, like L.A Confidential, Seven & The Usual Suspects. Unfortunately, despite what it's glowing reviews, box office figures and awards nominations may tell you, Sexy Beast isn't one of those films. While not being a complete disaster it is a very uninspired film that it is so safe and predictable that it feels more like a straight to DVD film rather than anything else.The plot is that a retired gangster, Gary Dove, is currently living a quiet life in Spain, with his wife and friends in a luxury villa. However, his peace is shattered when his former boss Don Logan abruptly arrives asking him to do one last job involving robbing one of London's most high tech banks. A conflicted Gary now has to decide whether to stay in peace and shelter or return for one last time into a dark underworld that might cost him dearly. The plot may sound very engaging at first, but it suffers from being utterly predictable, making the story lack any sort of tension or threat. It doesn't help that the heist isn't the movie's main focus, as most of the movie is spent focusing on the main character and how his decisions will affect those in the movie around him. While that does make the movie sound like an interesting character study, it isn't as there is little time focused on the main character's conflict, and rather is spent more time on Tarantino- esque conversations that don't advance the story much or Ben Kingsley's Don Logan, a character who seems entirely superfluous to the narrative, which considering how he takes up a lot of screen time is a major problem. The heist also suffers from the fact that the characters pull it off so easily and are unaffected by it's minimal consequences because of it, leading to a complete lack of tension in the process. This highlights the film's main problem there is nothing at stake here, as the plot is so predictable and simple, the main heist of the film is so easy to pull off and NONE of the characters change at all by the end of the film as a result. This makes the film all the more pointless of an experience to watch because of it.However, there are some positive attributes that this movie has to offer. The film is at least very well-made and all of the cast work give great performances and the film at least has some style. Music video director Jonathan Glazer does the best he can with such bland material by giving the film look good, using some clever camera-work and has art-house touches here and there, particularly a demonic rabbit motif that looks like something out of the deleted scenes of Donnie Darko. All of these stylistic touches are great, making it look like Terry Gilliam directing a gangster movie, and it helps the film get some much-needed distinction. I just wish with material this generic, Glazer had tried to be more ambitious and risky and had made the film more art-house by cranking his Kubrick, Gilliam and Fincher influences up to 11, as it may have been more memorable film. Sure it may have been more pretentious, but at least I would have admired it more because of it for being ambitious. A film like Snatch for example that came out at a similar time tries to recapture the brilliant plotting of Pulp Fiction, but fails, becoming an incoherent mess in the process and proved that director Guy Ritchie was way out of his depth. While at least I could admire that movie for at least having ambition, Sexy Beast mostly lacks this and when it does try to be artistically challenging, you can tell there is a more provocative and compelling gangster flick in there struggling to get out. As it is though, this is your standard Tarantino-esque knock-off whose plot so safe and characters so uninteresting that there is nothing truly memorable about the film apart from a few scenes, making it feel like this should have stayed away from theaters and should have gone straight-to-DVD where it belongs. Sure it's nowhere near as bad as 44 Inch Chest (although few movies are that bad), which is from the same writers and features much of the same cast, as Sexy Beast is average rather than flat-out awful. It's clearly well-made, has a great cast and that director Jonathan Glazer has talent and shows potential for his future endeavors into film- making. However, it suffers from similar problems as 44 Inch Chest it spends an hour focusing on pointless build-up, but fails to develop an interesting narrative or characters in that time and when the film gets to its main set-piece it is a major disappointment, making the viewing experience feel rather superfluous. Sure, while there are great performances and brilliant artistic touches here and there, all in all, this is just a safe and generic trope that despite its strong word of mouth should have gone straight-to-DVD, due to its lack trying to do anything innovative and experimental to a genre that by this point in time had run out of steam.

It doesn't help that the heist isn't the movie's main focus, as most of the movie is spent focusing on the main character and how his decisions will affect those in the movie around him. While that does make the movie sound like an interesting character study, it isn't as there is little time focused on the main character's conflict, and rather is spent more time on Tarantino- esque conversations that don't advance the story much or Ben Kingsley's Don Logan, a character who seems entirely superfluous to the narrative, which considering how he takes up a lot of screen time is a major problem. The heist also suffers from the fact that the characters pull it off so easily and are unaffected by it's minimal consequences because of it, leading to a complete lack of tension in the process. This highlights the film's main problem there is nothing at stake here, as the plot is so predictable and simple, the main heist of the film is so easy to pull off and NONE of the characters change at all by the end of the film as a result. This makes the film all the more pointless of an experience to watch because of it.However, there are some positive attributes that this movie has to offer. The film is at least very well-made and all of the cast work give great performances and the film at least has some style. Music video director Jonathan Glazer does the best he can with such bland material by giving the film look good, using some clever camera-work and has art-house touches here and there, particularly a demonic rabbit motif that looks like something out of the deleted scenes of Donnie Darko. All of these stylistic touches are great, making it look like Terry Gilliam directing a gangster movie, and it helps the film get some much-needed distinction. I just wish with material this generic, Glazer had tried to be more ambitious and risky and had made the film more art-house by cranking his Kubrick, Gilliam and Fincher influences up to 11, as it may have been more memorable film. Sure it may have been more pretentious, but at least I would have admired it more because of it for being ambitious. A film like Snatch for example that came out at a similar time tries to recapture the brilliant plotting of Pulp Fiction, but fails, becoming an incoherent mess in the process and proved that director Guy Ritchie was way out of his depth. While at least I could admire that movie for at least having ambition, Sexy Beast mostly lacks this and when it does try to be artistically challenging, you can tell there is a more provocative and compelling gangster flick in there struggling to get out. As it is though, this is your standard Tarantino-esque knock-off whose plot so safe and characters so uninteresting that there is nothing truly memorable about the film apart from a few scenes, making it feel like this should have stayed away from theaters and should have gone straight-to-DVD where it belongs. Sure it's nowhere near as bad as 44 Inch Chest (although few movies are that bad), which is from the same writers and features much of the same cast, as Sexy Beast is average rather than flat-out awful. It's clearly well-made, has a great cast and that director Jonathan Glazer has talent and shows potential for his future endeavors into film- making. However, it suffers from similar problems as 44 Inch Chest it spends an hour focusing on pointless build-up, but fails to develop an interesting narrative or characters in that time and when the film gets to its main set-piece it is a major disappointment, making the viewing experience feel rather superfluous. Sure, while there are great performances and brilliant artistic touches here and there, all in all, this is just a safe and generic trope that despite its strong word of mouth should have gone straight-to-DVD, due to its lack trying to do anything innovative and experimental to a genre that by this point in time had run out of steam.

There is a scene in this movie where a baby dies due to negligence, and our central gang of lead characters don't quite know how to react to it. I don't know if I know how to react to it, but I can tell you this much, as disturbing as this movie is, with all the disturbing themes it tackles, it also has behind it, a wonderful central performance from Ewan McGregor, brilliant direction, a tightly tied together plot which does not drag, and brilliant music choices.The best scene in the movie is Ewan McGregor locked in a room, detoxing as he sees visions around him, it's well done with brilliant music supported by brilliant acting and directing.Is it disgusting? I think it is. But I think beyond it's disgusting veneer lies a beautiful film which explores admirably the themes of being an addict, and how that affects you, and just how hard it is breaking out.If you really like trains though and actually indulge in actual 'trainspotting' (which is a real hobbie), don't expect any of that in this movie, but what you do get is quite brilliant.

Now to say that this film is 'dreadful' is wrong, but saying its the worst feature is right. One thing that the entire trilogy does is show us the different points of the nuclear setting, the first Mad Max showed us the beginnings and how law and order were still around but slowly deteriorating. Road Warrior showed us a point in time of desperation, scavenging and surviving by any means possible and Thunderdome is able to show us the compromise, people coming to terms with the world they live in and making a new world for themselves. All three are key parts of the universal disaster trilogy. When you watch the entire trilogy in a day you notice the differences, especially in the third. It started off great and very in keeping with the setting of the previous films, and the actual Thunderdome arena scene is extremely fun to watch. However from Max's banishment it all went sour. The entire time we were in the tribe setting all I could think was 'Hook'. Maybe that's a personal reference I don't know but it just completely went away from the adrenaline fuelled vengeful predecessors. Even Max himself went from being the enigmatic angered 'road warrior' to then being this almost father like figure to a group of lost children. All too fantasised compared to the others, but still saved by some good action sequences. Of course the transition from '18' to '15' can give you an insight into the theme changes but again slightly over-criticised and definitely worth some attention if you like the first two.
