Seeing it after just finishing Steinbeck's book, though, I was a little disappointed. Even though it's a great movie, it's not so great of an adaptation.Throughout the film, I never really felt Steinbeck's message really coming across, except in certain points when direct dialogue was used from the book. Steinbeck showed the story of many people in his novel, and how important it was for them to come together as a community, while the movie focuses simply on the Joads. There is hardly any interaction between the Joads and the other Okies at all. In the end, Ma talks about surviving, and how that was all they had to do to make everything better. Steinbeck never wanted the Joads or any other Okie to just survive, he wanted them to come together as a whole and make sure they got their rights. The movie shows that just surviving makes everything better. Ending with the government camp (craftily renamed wheat patch rather than weedpatch) gives the sense that there are decent people, and the Joads will have no problem finding decent people and a place to live. Ending with the boxcar and the flood and Rose of Sharon's scene (which is understandably not in the movie) shows that the hard times were hard from over, but if they stay as a community, they can try to make things better.All of this being said, the movie has some really good references back to the book. Most of the actors managed to completely get their characters down. My main problem was with Al, and how much he was downplayed in the film. (And I felt a little hurt when they completely forgot about Noah). Ma and Tom and Casey, however, really did manage to find their characters. The scene between Ma and Tom right before Tom left was the scene that felt the most true to me. I was upset, though, that the only characters allowed to be seen and developed through the movie were the Joads, and every connection they had with other families, like the Williams and the Wainwrights, did not exist. The connections between the families was what brought out the book's message, and made it about more than just the Joads. It made it about everyone.I understand the context this movie was made in, with the Depression barely over, the memories and events of Steinbeck's novel still fresh in everyone's minds. A complete replica of The Grapes of Wrath would have a been a bit too harsh for everyone then, and honestly impossible with the technology of the time. I think I would just ask in a remake for them to try to get it a little better.It really is a fantastic film, especially for the time period, and on its own it's great. In terms of displaying Steinbeck's message, though, it does miss the mark.

The answers are multiple  the dark, the evil, a mysterious presence, death ultimately; in fact, anything incontrollable. And when you think about it, all these elements have something in common they refer to an unknown force whose presence is palpable. Indeed, the unknown scares, because it can't be seen, can't be controlled, therefore, can't be fought.These are the primitives fears that tortured the life of people since the dawn of humanity, and we inherited this fears in the same unconscious way our children will. We're aware of our mortal nature, and each of our fears is driven by this awareness, which is due to the biggest fear, the fear of the unknown. And the genius of The Exorcist is that it perfectly plays on these primitive instincts of ours, to provide the greatest Horror film ever made, a thrilling masterpiece of realism that'll haunt cinematic memories for ever. As soon as the Tubular bells start ringing, the film is inhabited by an atmosphere that will never desert it, a fearsome and gloomy ambiance absorbing any place we're watching the film in. Everything is directed with such confidence and meticulousness, the thrills almost come precociously. Indeed, before anything happens, we feel something WILL happen, but we don't know what. It seems like a cinematic trick, but not any director has the guts to let you wait more than almost half an hour before the oddities happen. The set-up is slow paced in The Exorcist because it's a movie that respects our intelligence, and doesn't try to provide cheap thrills. William Friedkin who had just made another realistic masterpiece, the Best Picture Winner The French Connection is so confident he gives us enough time to discover the characters, to get into their daily life, patiently waiting for the pivotal point that will join their fates. The direction, the writing are all in subtlety, and work because even though nothing happens yet, we keep our guard up, we know there's an evil presence somewhere, we can feel it.This is an old cinematic device started by directors who hadn't enough money to portray credible monster-type villains they understood that sometimes, the scare is more efficient from the suggestion of a presence than its explicit depiction. When you see, you know, and if you know, you can control, but in The Exorcist, the villain is here, but we never see him, he's like the shark from Jaws or Alien, with a slight difference, he's not visible because he controls the body of a poor little girl. Linda Blair, as the demonically possessed Regan MacNeil , is so convincing, it broke my heart to see how the evil can have so devastating effects on a pure little soul. And the tragedy of Regan is the torment of her mother, Chris, Ellen Burstyn, perfect as a totally helpless woman, incapable of saving her little girl. And this is the fascinating aspect of the film, more than a horror drama, it also works as a thrilling mystery. A mystery where the Lieutenant Detective Kinderman, Lee J. Cobb in one of his great last roles, is the one who investigates about the strange phenomena that occurred and acts as a bridge between the victims and the priests.So many questions are raised in the beginning, we understand that sooner or later, we'll have an exorcism. Well, it's the title, isn't it? But the set-up is necessary. The parallel stories where we're transported into the universes of Father Damien Karras, portrayed by Jason Miller, and the iconic Father Merryl, Max Von Sydow, challenge our patience we can't wait for the exorcism ... but without the build-up, the climax would be worthless. It's a movie where any flaws can be caused by an impatience from the director, an eagerness to distract the masses with thrilling moments, but a big impatience could have ruined such a magnificent and ambitious project. And The Exorcist would never have been the masterpiece it is without this patience. However, this would never have been such an iconic horror masterpiece without the few horrifying moments that punctuate the movie between the set-up and the climax. And by horrifying, I won't give any clues, let's just say it works on every level visual, sounds, atmosphere, cinematography, dialogs, special effects, and of course, timing, since all these effects come at the least expected moments, provoking reactions in total symbiosis with the characters. We feel and fear for them, as the realism implies that it could even happen to us. This is no Hollywood, this is true horror.Lately, the American Film institute listed the Top 100 movies and I must admit I was shocked not to see The Exorcist in the list... it's a classic, probably the most horrifying horror film ever made. It has everything, a dazzling cinematography incarnated by the iconic shot of Father Merryl's shadowy silhouette coming from the mist, an unforgettable villain, and of course shocking moments where the make-up, the visual and sound effects prove how vital they are for such a genre that relies so much on realism. But this realism would have been nothing without the genius of the script and the masterful direction, that could finally let the film exude all its greatness in the last act, one of the most unforgettable climactic sequences ever, putting The Exorcist among those films that transcends the simple act of watching, becoming more of experiences.And this is why I waited for years and years before finally getting to watch The Exorcist, one of the few movies that scared me even before watching it. And all I can say is that it met my expectations.

Cobb in one of his great last roles, is the one who investigates about the strange phenomena that occurred and acts as a bridge between the victims and the priests.So many questions are raised in the beginning, we understand that sooner or later, we'll have an exorcism. Well, it's the title, isn't it? But the set-up is necessary. The parallel stories where we're transported into the universes of Father Damien Karras, portrayed by Jason Miller, and the iconic Father Merryl, Max Von Sydow, challenge our patience we can't wait for the exorcism ... but without the build-up, the climax would be worthless. It's a movie where any flaws can be caused by an impatience from the director, an eagerness to distract the masses with thrilling moments, but a big impatience could have ruined such a magnificent and ambitious project. And The Exorcist would never have been the masterpiece it is without this patience. However, this would never have been such an iconic horror masterpiece without the few horrifying moments that punctuate the movie between the set-up and the climax. And by horrifying, I won't give any clues, let's just say it works on every level visual, sounds, atmosphere, cinematography, dialogs, special effects, and of course, timing, since all these effects come at the least expected moments, provoking reactions in total symbiosis with the characters. We feel and fear for them, as the realism implies that it could even happen to us. This is no Hollywood, this is true horror.Lately, the American Film institute listed the Top 100 movies and I must admit I was shocked not to see The Exorcist in the list... it's a classic, probably the most horrifying horror film ever made. It has everything, a dazzling cinematography incarnated by the iconic shot of Father Merryl's shadowy silhouette coming from the mist, an unforgettable villain, and of course shocking moments where the make-up, the visual and sound effects prove how vital they are for such a genre that relies so much on realism. But this realism would have been nothing without the genius of the script and the masterful direction, that could finally let the film exude all its greatness in the last act, one of the most unforgettable climactic sequences ever, putting The Exorcist among those films that transcends the simple act of watching, becoming more of experiences.And this is why I waited for years and years before finally getting to watch The Exorcist, one of the few movies that scared me even before watching it. And all I can say is that it met my expectations. And watching it at night (with someone, I would recommend) gets more hypnotic and absorbing after each viewing &#x85; The Exorcist is a must-see and ... be careful, any second, it can surprise you, really &#x85; ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"27 March 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Stanley Kubrick turns his ever-precise eye to Stephen King's novel, and although far more a supernatural horror than the familial psychodrama King intended, the film stands alone as an absolute masterpiece (and ironically far more exciting and memorable than King's own mini-series adaption). Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrence, a writer who takes a care-taking post at The Overlook Hotel for the winter period; he is intent on using the time to get a new writing project underway. After moving in, it quickly becomes apparent there is something wrong with the hotel, and its effect on Jack is apparently to drive him insane and desperate to destroy his family. Shelley Duvall and young Danny Lloyd play wife and child with nowhere to go.Kubrick is a filmmaker's filmmaker, and as is nearly always the case with his work, one of the biggest stars of The Shining is the man's technical brilliance and desire to push the envelope. From the famous, grand shots at the beginning (it has been difficult ever since to see epic aerial landscape photography without being reminded of the opening of this film), to some of the best steadicam work you will see, even when compared to the movies of today, it is a cinematic tour-de-force. Kubrick's attention to details whose job it is, if only on a subconscious level, to put you constantly on edge is rather impressive; before the production, he read Freud's essay The Uncanny, about the feeling of something being uncomfortably strange whilst remaining familiar, and was intent on working that theme in at many a turn. What better film to work it into than one about the man who is supposed to love you wanting to murder you? Not a frame is wasted, and rarely is a moment not visually arresting, tense of unnerving, due to unique framing, lighting, or noticeably exciting camera language. The result is a movie with numerous iconic scenes and startling imagery. The soundtrack also might just be one of the most jarring and haunting in horror cinema; dense, loud, dissonant strings and found sounds shred regularly at your nerves. One of the film's best moments combines all the above, and may leave you with nightmares of little boys muttering Redrum at your bedside...as if kids doing strange things wasn't creepy enough! This is a film you may find you do not love immediately; as always with Kubrick, there is a lot to take in, and the sense that he is making the film to be interesting rather than necessarily realistic is never far away. Detractors of the film cite the over-the-top nature of Nicholson's performance to be one of the issues they have with it, but I think Kubrick knew the absurdity of the character, the dark humour played against the isolated horror setting, would really accentuate the pressure, discomfort and sense of entrapment, with nobody else to turn to, Wendy and Danny are suffering.

Every time a camera lens appears in a film, 'film-about-film' interpretations become myriad. Dissertations about apparent realities and fictions seem to practically write themselves. In a brilliant early scene, Antonioni gives us the photographer as the creator of reality, a cruel god who has a world at his bidding. When he tells his models to shut their eyes for no good reason, out of the whim of power, they do.Then he wanders through streets, antique shops, and parks, hoping to see something through the lens, something that is worth seeing. The ultimate ground or principle of the photographer's trade is that, through his camera, he can capture the world as it really is, that he can enable a true perception through his artificial eye.

Where a small reaction, the guitarist's irritation at an amplifier that won't work, escalates into a frenzy, and turns a crowd of passive observers into crazed animals. It makes sense then that even a more indifferent onlooker, David Hemmings, is swept up in this, until out of the club, in the quiet, he's struck by the meaninglessness of the encounter.

There are some great performances and it has many ups and downs along the way. It is based on a book by Oliver Sacks, a true story which will play at your heartstrings at times. More of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please help get Leonard back into bed while I write the next paragraph).Dr. Malcolm Sayer has always worked in research because he doesn't really get on with people. He has to take a job at a hospital where he has no choice but to work with the patients. There he meets, amongst his patients, Leonard Lowe, who has been in a catatonic state for thirty years. With the help of his assistant, Eleanor Costello, Dr. Sawyer carries out a series of tests to discover just what is wrong with him. He eventually discovers it is to do with an encephalitis epidemic back in the 1920's and it is now the late 60's. Convinced he can find as cure, reads up on all the current medications and finds an experimental drug that might do the trick. His boss, Dr. Kaufman, will only let him try it on one patient, he chooses Leonard and thus begins the awakenings&#x85; but will it last, and what are the consequences? I'll have to leave it there so as not to be beaten by the Spoiler Police.This is a really well made film with a beautiful score by Randy Newman, enhanced with many songs, both old and new. Great performances all round, particularly from Robert De Niro as Leonard Lowe and Robin Williams as Dr. Malcolm Sayer, who both went and observed Oliver Sacks and his patients prior to making this film, and it showed. I also have to mention Julie Kavner, it's nice to see the voice of Marge Simpson as a real person for a change.

Lawrence Kasdan directs from a screenplay that he co-wrote with Frank Galati based on the original novel by Anne Tyler but perhaps this was material best left in the literary form.William Hurt stars as Macon Leary, a travel writer who specialises in writing guides that help people feel as if they haven't strayed too far from home. He does this by keeping himself isolated from anyone else and by rigidly organising his life as much as possible. All well and good but it has not helped things between Leary and his wife (Kathleen Turner) since they lost their son in a tragic, random shooting a year or so ago. When his wife decides that she has had enough, Leary goes to stay with his sister and two brothers, all of them as socially dysfunctional and strange in a way that's slightly different from their brother but just as difficult to live with. Things are thrown off kilter by two things a slightly loopy dog trainer\/single mother (Geena Davis) that Leary meets and ends up enjoying time with (as well as time with her son) and the arrival of Leary's boss, Julian (Bill Pullman).I enjoyed moments of The Accidental Tourist. What's to dislike about the performances from a cast of people including William Hurt, Kathleen Turner, Geena Davis, Bill Pullman (putting in one of his best performances, actually), Amy Wright, David Ogden Steirs and Ed Begley Jr? The script also has a number of nice moments, particularly when comparing Hurt's travel advice to the events going on in his life, but it also has a number of exchanges that just felt completely unbelievable and contrived.

Utilizing much advanced technology and film-technique for its time, the movie was revolutionary in its cinematic grandeur. However, Nunnally Johnson, author of the screenplay, strayed from the path Steinbeck had purposely traveled down with his storyline. While the film still includes some of the fundamental values and scenes that make the book one of the best historical pieces of fiction, the omission and reversing of certain scenes may leave avid viewers enamored with the original story feeling a sense of dissatisfaction. The movie ends with the superficial riding off into the sunset ending which implies that all is well or will be down the road (no pun intended!); however, this is counter to Steinbeck's artfully crafted ending. Perhaps the largest mistake made by director Tom Ford and writer Nunnally Johnson was the reversal of stops the Joad family made along their journey after their final arrival in the supposedly-plentiful land of California. The decision to make the government camp the last seen stop for the family sends out a blatant pro-government message, which at the time served as propaganda to rally support for the government in its Dust Bowl-related reforms. With the reversal of the sequence of the Joads' stops, the movie is not a precise display of the story that captures the essence of the novel the hardships and obstacles of exodus, and the importance of family, community, and perseverance to find a home in a foreign land. However, keeping in mind the standards of controversy in this time, the original ending in the book would have been too racy for a movie. With that in mind, the ending is not as disappointing.Furthermore, Grapes of Wrath remains a thought-provoking film that serves as a great culturally enlightening experience for those looking to gain insight on the Oakie migrations and pushing out towards the great American Frontier. After getting over the initial disappointment of the movie-produced happy ending, viewers can appreciate the believable historical setting and the development of the characters created by John Steinbeck in his original work.

Not only did it tell a new and interesting science fiction story, it was an incredibly culturally and politically relevant film that had a clear and important message to the world. The film is about the alien Klaatu and his giant robot, Gort. They arrive on Earth in Washington DC with peaceful intentions, but Klaatu is immediately fired upon and he is rushed to a hospital. His message to Earth is a sinister, yet important one. He wants them to know that if the human race continues on like it currently is, his planet will have no choice but to destroy them. This message couldn't be any more relevant than in the political atmosphere of the 1950's when threat of nuclear annihilation hung over the heads of all mankind. Science was being used for evil and the developments of nuclear bombs threatened the entire human race. In the movie it is Klaatu's job to stop this. The movie isn't subtle about its message at all. It is blatant and sincere, sending a sure fire message to the world that they had to stop before it was too late.This is just one of those really smart sci-fi films. It doesn't blow things out of proportion and it keeps itself at bay to convey clearly its message. The script is really smart, was well as the pacing. There isn't a wasted line in this film and it seems that every bit of dialouge bears some sort of importance. It can be as blatant as Klaatu's final monolouge to the human race, or as subtle and brief as Klaatu's mentioning that atomic power can be used for things like ship fuel, rather than bombs. The film flows really well and keeps at a consistent level of intelligence as well as urgency. Robert Wise employs the use of these slow montages that are really neat. There will be a series of shots from various locations around the world that show different nations reactions to the events occurring in Washington DC. It all plays very well into the title of the of the film, which is The Day the EARTH Stood Still.In spite of everything we can't forget that this film was made back when science fiction in film was a very small idea, and thus the budgets for these kinds of films weren't as gracious as they are today. Because of this there is a little bit of cheese when it comes to the alien design. And yet at the same time there is consistency. Everything has a very simplistic design to it. The exterior of the spaceship has almost no detail to it. The interior is pretty much the same except for some funny looking lights and consoles. Gort the robot is a very simple robot without anything incredible or flashy about him.

It's a lot of brainless fun with a lot of very good looking cars on screen for most of its duration.Paul Walker plays Brian, an undercover cop trying to get into the street racing circuit to find out just who is responsible for a number of daring heists on moving trucks. The prime suspect is Dominic, played by Vin Diesel, who is the centre of the street racing scene and the man that most of the main players look up to. But Brian gets close, too close.

So, I knew about the film when it was current, but also heard that it was getting really bad reviews. Since then, I have become more familiar with the work of Dana Carvey, who co-wrote and starred in this flick. I have now seen several of his Saturday Night Live sketches, and also the two Wayne's World movies, for which he and Mike Myers brought their headbanging alter egos from SNL to film, so I know that Carvey can be funny. Nearly nine years after The Master of Disguise was unleashed upon the world and disgusted many people, I've finally seen it, and am now not surprised that I can't contradict the majority's opinion.Pistachio Disguisey is a young Italian man who is totally unaware of the fact that he comes from a long line of secret agents who have all been very skilled in disguising themselves for missions. His father, Fabbrizio, decided it was best not to tell his son about the family's legacy. So, instead of being one of these Masters of Disguise, like his father once was but not anymore, Pistachio works as a waiter in his father's Italian restaurant in the United States, where his mother also works. One night, Pistachio's parents are kidnapped by Devlin Bowman, a criminal whom Fabbrizio brought to justice during one of his missions as a Master of Disguise, but this criminal has just gotten out of prison! After this kidnapping, the youngest Disguisey's grandfather comes to him and tells him about the family's legacy, and then trains him to use his Disguisey powers, so he can take on Bowman himself and rescue his parents. Meanwhile, the kidnapper is now forcing Fabbrizio the help him with his criminal activities! I've seen too many unfunny comedies lately, and sadly, this one is no exception. Like probably most people who have seen this universally panned 2002 comedy adventure film, I didn't laugh at all. Two or three gags did force the corners of my mouth up, with one or maybe two of the slaps for example, but even those aren't usually funny, and perhaps get a bit tiresome. The turtle costume clip I saw in the trailer in 2002 may not have looked so bad, but this part of the movie is a great example of the lameness here, with Dana Carvey as Pistachio trying to be funny, but basically just being ridiculously goofy, and the same can probably be said about most of the other disguises. Many of the jokes in the film involve the lead character's fondness of large female buttocks, and this is never funny. There's also a running gag showing that whenever Devlin Bowman laughs, he is soon silenced by his own flatulence, and this doesn't tend to be funny, even if it ALMOST made me smile later on for some reason. Not only is the humour in his film consistently lame, the plot is also boring and clumsily written.After this film was made, Dana Carvey went on hiatus to focus on his family life, and I can't blame him for that, but this sure was a poor piece for him to leave us with. Since then, he has returned to show business, making several TV appearances and showing that he still has his talent, which is something he didn't show when he made The Master of Disguise. It appears he is also returning to the silver screen in the upcoming Jack and Jill, coming from Happy Madison Productions, the company that was also involved in the production of this 2002 disaster, but no matter how good or bad this movie turns out to be, it looks like Carvey will only have a very small part in it. Well, even if he never plays any major film role again, he has proved to be a talented comedian through his decades in the business, despite this terrible film.

Besides the overall theme of a fictional retro-future dictatorship, the movie has several layers relevant to our own society.WORK ENVIRONMENTWe all have encountered such pathetic specimens The incompetent cowardly boss Mr Kurtzman, unable to take responsibility and delegating everything to his subordinate Sam.The false sense of action and energy, when the supervisor runs through the halls, followed by a crowd of subservient subordinates requesting decisions swiftly given by the superior.The dire working conditions (dark narrow office) much in contrast to this energetic positive work attitude.The petty competition of fellow coworkers, exemplified in the neighbor of Sam pulling the shared desk towards his own side or trying to show off his (non-existent) computer skills.The way how office workers break rules\/regulations to make work life more bearable, by watching a classic movie channel.TOTALITARIAN GOVERNMENTWe in the West live in democracies, but much of the double speak shown in the film has slowly penetrated our own political life.The cruel and impartial attitude of security forces making prisoners and putting them into these sacks reminiscent of hooded photos from Abu Ghraib. These forces are normal people, chat about work misery (headache from helmets), but treat their subjects with non-compassionate harshness, strictly according to procedures and regulations.The government's paranoid pursuit of suspected terrorists and efforts in uncovering hidden (non-existent) connections. See the pursuit of Tuttle, who just wants to work as a heating engineer, because he enjoys it, but hates to comply with tight rules and regulations. We see currently the same by linking every terrorist act to Al Quaida, even if the links are unproven (war in Iraq comes to mind, also 9\/11 changed everything) Emptiness of slogans, public announcements, posters, showing the paranoia, feeding the public fear of terrorists and justifying government actions.Refusal of government authority to admit an error. The heartlessness and lack of compassion when they realize the error. The overall long-winded process of appeal when citizens tries to correct it. And the labeling of such citizens as a terrorists.GENERAL SOCIETYTwo attitude types enable totalitarian systems one is represented by the under-the-radar-screen-operating main character, Sam. The other attitude is represented by the ambition, opportunism and suppression of conscience by Jack Lint, actively supporting the system and one of its representatives.The obsession with youth and cosmetic surgery, represented by Sam's mother's plastic surgery and her desire to look young. The parody of cosmetic surgery peaks twice in once instance the person whose surgery went terribly wrong, dies. In the other instance, Sam's mother looks like his love interest in an Oedipean twist, although only in his mind during the torture.The emphasis on cleanliness in the streets, where passers-by are upset when a few papers are dropped on the streets, but where nobody appears to protest against the dirty oppression.The celebration of Christmas which has lost all spiritual meaning and is hollowed into formality of giving thoughtless interchangeable arbitrary presents. The consumer society (Consumers for Christ) encompasses shopping, expensive goods, and even when a bombing occurs, the show must go on. But actual substance is lost meals are only piles of colored mash.Blind faith in technology - but a simple bug can have deadly consequences, and technological gadgets appear to malfunction at any opportunity. Especially the climate control. Everywhere are many hoses and wires, at home, in the restaurant, during public cleaning.The annoying dealings with the monopolized services of Central Services. Everybody in our own world and time has had to deal with such non-responsive entities (BT comes to my mind). Free enterprise (Tuttle) is illegal.The overabundance of bureaucracy as it stifles all functioning of a society. The formalization of all transactions with receipts and receipts for receipts, the rules and regulations that govern everything. The strict adherence to these rules appears to give every government action a coat of legitimacy.The loss of natural environment, as a consequence of providing energy\/power and of overpopulation in densely urban cities. There appears to be no park, no trees. People live in dense blocks without any daylight. Roads outside the city lead to power plants, through deserted polluted landscapes, big billboards blocking the view and showing advertisement and government slogans, depicting among other things landscape and blue sky, which is no longer in existence in the real world.Desensitation of children growing up in dire housing complexes, playing war games with weapons. For Christmas they get guns as presents, and they play out security force and prisoners, with realistically hooding their prisoners as the adult world is doing it. This desensitization is also a reality in our real world, by the proliferation of ego-shooter computer games.FILMOGRAPHICThis movie pays homage to classic movies, as the only thing bringing real joy, but also acting as an escapism for the unbearable reality of the present life. Very funny the reference to Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin where security forces walk down the stairs, and a lonely cleaning equipment cart rolls down these stairs (instead of a stroller like in the original). Also there is a parallel to the film that the office workers are watching (Casablanca), when Jonathan Price says to his boss here is looking at you.Overall this movie is addressing all the above topics not on a rational level, but on a deeply emotional one. The main protagonist has his dreams, and in a very illogical way these dreams meddle with the reality, as he suddenly sees and meets the woman of his dreams. This film is an emotional appeal for humanity, to do everything to prevent such a society becoming reality.

Besides the overall theme of a fictional retro-future dictatorship, the movie has several layers relevant to our own society.WORK ENVIRONMENTWe all have encountered such pathetic specimens The incompetent cowardly boss Mr Kurtzman, unable to take responsibility and delegating everything to his subordinate Sam.The false sense of action and energy, when the supervisor runs through the halls, followed by a crowd of subservient subordinates requesting decisions swiftly given by the superior.The dire working conditions (dark narrow office) much in contrast to this energetic positive work attitude.The petty competition of fellow coworkers, exemplified in the neighbor of Sam pulling the shared desk towards his own side or trying to show off his (non-existent) computer skills.The way how office workers break rules\/regulations to make work life more bearable, by watching a classic movie channel.TOTALITARIAN GOVERNMENTWe in the West live in democracies, but much of the double speak shown in the film has slowly penetrated our own political life.The cruel and impartial attitude of security forces making prisoners and putting them into these sacks reminiscent of hooded photos from Abu Ghraib. These forces are normal people, chat about work misery (headache from helmets), but treat their subjects with non-compassionate harshness, strictly according to procedures and regulations.The government's paranoid pursuit of suspected terrorists and efforts in uncovering hidden (non-existent) connections. See the pursuit of Tuttle, who just wants to work as a heating engineer, because he enjoys it, but hates to comply with tight rules and regulations. We see currently the same by linking every terrorist act to Al Quaida, even if the links are unproven (war in Iraq comes to mind, also 9\/11 changed everything) Emptiness of slogans, public announcements, posters, showing the paranoia, feeding the public fear of terrorists and justifying government actions.Refusal of government authority to admit an error. The heartlessness and lack of compassion when they realize the error. The overall long-winded process of appeal when citizens tries to correct it. And the labeling of such citizens as a terrorists.GENERAL SOCIETYTwo attitude types enable totalitarian systems one is represented by the under-the-radar-screen-operating main character, Sam. The other attitude is represented by the ambition, opportunism and suppression of conscience by Jack Lint, actively supporting the system and one of its representatives.The obsession with youth and cosmetic surgery, represented by Sam's mother's plastic surgery and her desire to look young. The parody of cosmetic surgery peaks twice in once instance the person whose surgery went terribly wrong, dies. In the other instance, Sam's mother looks like his love interest in an Oedipean twist, although only in his mind during the torture.The emphasis on cleanliness in the streets, where passers-by are upset when a few papers are dropped on the streets, but where nobody appears to protest against the dirty oppression.The celebration of Christmas which has lost all spiritual meaning and is hollowed into formality of giving thoughtless interchangeable arbitrary presents. The consumer society (Consumers for Christ) encompasses shopping, expensive goods, and even when a bombing occurs, the show must go on. But actual substance is lost meals are only piles of colored mash.Blind faith in technology - but a simple bug can have deadly consequences, and technological gadgets appear to malfunction at any opportunity. Especially the climate control. Everywhere are many hoses and wires, at home, in the restaurant, during public cleaning.The annoying dealings with the monopolized services of Central Services. Everybody in our own world and time has had to deal with such non-responsive entities (BT comes to my mind). Free enterprise (Tuttle) is illegal.The overabundance of bureaucracy as it stifles all functioning of a society. The formalization of all transactions with receipts and receipts for receipts, the rules and regulations that govern everything. The strict adherence to these rules appears to give every government action a coat of legitimacy.The loss of natural environment, as a consequence of providing energy\/power and of overpopulation in densely urban cities. There appears to be no park, no trees. People live in dense blocks without any daylight. Roads outside the city lead to power plants, through deserted polluted landscapes, big billboards blocking the view and showing advertisement and government slogans, depicting among other things landscape and blue sky, which is no longer in existence in the real world.Desensitation of children growing up in dire housing complexes, playing war games with weapons. For Christmas they get guns as presents, and they play out security force and prisoners, with realistically hooding their prisoners as the adult world is doing it. This desensitization is also a reality in our real world, by the proliferation of ego-shooter computer games.FILMOGRAPHICThis movie pays homage to classic movies, as the only thing bringing real joy, but also acting as an escapism for the unbearable reality of the present life. Very funny the reference to Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin where security forces walk down the stairs, and a lonely cleaning equipment cart rolls down these stairs (instead of a stroller like in the original). Also there is a parallel to the film that the office workers are watching (Casablanca), when Jonathan Price says to his boss here is looking at you.Overall this movie is addressing all the above topics not on a rational level, but on a deeply emotional one. The main protagonist has his dreams, and in a very illogical way these dreams meddle with the reality, as he suddenly sees and meets the woman of his dreams. This film is an emotional appeal for humanity, to do everything to prevent such a society becoming reality. Because once it is established, there is nothing that can bring it down &#x96; as the very pessimistic ending of the film implies.
