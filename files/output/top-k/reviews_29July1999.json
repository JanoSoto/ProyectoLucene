[{"date":"29 July 1999","score":"2 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":"  Election is so confused, muddled, and unpleasant it's hard to know which end to start carving.  There's no one in the movie remotely likeable.  Sure, there are people we can identify with, if we examine ourselves, for a little Tracy Flick flickers inside every one of us.  But of all the characters in the movie she's the only one who exhibits any laudable traits, lacking only one thing  any real kindness.  Although she's supposed to be the manipulative one, everyone else in the movie is more manipulative than she, and she herself is manipulated and abused by more than one character.  Although Broderick, in a fine, understated performance, seems to be meant for the emotional center of the film, he's a bigger jerk than Flick.  That there was not one minute of pathos for the corner of loneliness Flick painted herself into shows poor writing.  She never had one minute of self-examination or illumination;  and that's all that kept her from being one of the all-time great movie characters.  And it's too bad, too, because she was the only character in this confused and unpleasant road-kill of a movie that was in any way worth saving.  It shows what a lousy pass we've come to in this country that people who want to make something of their life and have any sort of work ethic are so casually abused and hated by theatre-goers.  Perhaps that's why there was, eventually, no introspection for Tracy Flick that led her to any  random acts of kindness, or any genuine feeling for another human being, (for which, surely, her mother was more to be blamed, another manipulator on poor Tracy Flick), she would have been *right*.  It seemed to be the point of the script that anyone who wants to actually accomplish anything, whether from selfish or unselfish intentions (we never saw any of the latter in this movie from anyone) can ever be right.  If Reese Witherspoon hadn't done such a good job on Tracy, who should've been the emotional center of the film, it would be poorly considered now;  and in a few years, save for that one performance, it will be deservedly shelved and forgotton, gathering dust on video-store shelves until its obsessive fans can buy all remaining copies from discount bins.  But even then, it'll be a waste of money.

There have been a lot of disparging reviews about this movie at imdb and amazon, but I disagree with all of them.  This movie makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside.  The ending is perfect.  And there are tons of hilarious moments distributed throughoutDean Is that a no? Laney That's a hell no!I loved the prom scene at the end.   They had a dance scene led by Usher Raymond the singer.  It was great!  Jodi Lynn O' Keefe is a pretty good dancer!  My favorite part of the movie has to be the scene where Laney is walking down the steps right after she gets her makeoever and Zac sees her for the first time.  Kiss Me is playing in the background.  So touching!This movie was so much better than any of the other teen movies that are out now (i.e American Pie and Election).  It was so hilarious!  How can you help not falling in love with both Zac and Laney?  They are both so loveable!  And you love to hate Dean and Taylor, the bad guys.  Everything works out perfectly in the end, though.The only bad thing iss that this movie represents an unrealisitc view of high school life.  All of the characters are rich (Preston's dad owns a chain of car dealerships and has a house the size of a large hotel).  Laney is supposed to be poor because her father owns a pool cleaning business, but even she has a large house with a pool in her backyard.  All of the kids drive jeeps or convertibles and this is what reminds most viewers of Clueless when they watch this movie.  However, I would definitely give this movie a 10 out of 10.  There was one part of the movie that was bizarre though Laney did not look so bad in the beginning of the movie.  She was beautiful, she just had on glasses and an ugly wig.  Obviously, when they worked on her a bit, she would look fantastic.  But, are we supposed to believe that Zac's little sister Mac gave Laney her big makeover? I mean, half of the girl's hair was cut off and shaped into a new 'do.  Could a 16 year old really accomplish all of that?  If Mac was so talented in makeup and hair, why did she always look so bummy herself?  I was just wondering.  I did like Mac's role though.  Simon (Laney's brother) was one of the few loveable siblings that you see in the movies, and of course, I LOVED Matthew Lillard as Brock.  He was hilarious with his Rick James impersonation. And the cameos by Li'l Kim and Sarah Michelle Gellar from Buffy the Vampire Slayer were great (you have to look hard to find her- she doesn't even speak).
