Midway showed a racial issue of an innocent Japanese family being held by the FBI for being questionable citizens. It was slow at the start introducing the different characters. This movie took place 4 months after Pearl Harbor when the American Pacific fleet was out numbered to the Japanese. I was surprised to see how the technology made things difficult to know where the enemy ships are; it reminded me of the game battleship where sinking a battleship was based off of luck. The quote at the end said by one of the officers in command was I don't know if we were better than the Japanese or if we were more lucky than the Japanese. This was a good representation of what this battle at sea was. Overall I'd give it an 8 out of 10 with the great acting by all the Asians in this movie.

In spite of his brazen sense of humor, he could enrapture a broad audience of common filmgoers with suspense or melodrama with a haunting movie like The Lost Weekend, a legal drama like Witness For the Prosecution, a noir like Double Indemnity or an eerie piece of meta-Hollywood like Sunset Boulevard. I believe that, while I've begun to consider him primarily a director of comedies, he learned a great deal from the apparent zeal of said classics. In an unprecedented surprise like The Fortune Cookie, he presents us with a rubber-faced farce, but he takes his time and builds drama and moral dilemma that projects toward us beyond the comfortable arm's-length distance of slapstick. The charm is that these curious instances of eyebrow-curling don't permeate the subsequent laughs with a breach of comic tone. They simply enter and exit on the cues of the story's character arcs.This extraordinarily entertaining comedy takes its time by building scene by extensive scene. They are even given headings like chapters in a novel. Each scene is like its own self- contained play, beginning with Jack Lemmon's CBS cameraman Henry Hinkle covering a Browns game in Cleveland. Before disaster strikes, setting the scene for the progressing story, Wilder gives tremendous definition to the scene in and of itself, the game, the sportscasting, our protagonist's job and his attitude towards doing it. Such is the manner in which each and every story advance is treated, given whole substantial scenes, as Henry is visited in the hospital by his conniving lawyer brother-in-law Whiplash Willie Gingrich, played by a hilarious Walter Matthau in a much-deserved Oscar-winning performance, who convinces him to pretend that his legs have been paralyzed so they can make a killing off the insurance company. Of course, the insurance company suspects that the paralysis is a fake one, and so a cat-and-mouse game begins. The trouble is, Boom Boom, the football player responsible for Henry's hospitalization turns out to be a nice guy. Too nice, in fact. Almost like a samurai, he invests most of his time in taking care of, even pampering, Henry, whose guilt begins to take its toll as he witnesses guilt doing the same to Boom Boom.Wilder was one of the great smugglers, as Martin Scorsese would call him. Censors were still breathing down Hollywood's neck to some extent in the 1960s in spite of all the steps forward American movies were beginning to take. Wilder knew how to signify something considerable to the audience without directly telegraphing it, most of the time anyway. What The Fortune Cookie does is impose a bold move in favor of the era's civil rights movement. Boom Boom is black, played by Ron Rich, who was known very little elsewhere save for his performance here. For much of the film, he is overwhelmingly servile, almost saintly, to the white man he injures, and Wilder allows us to become slightly concerned with such a portrayal. Could this film be interpreted as demeaning? we think. However, the way the story proceeds, it is a ballsy storytelling tool that makes Henry's guilt significantly more poignant than it would've been had the character been less conspicuously defined.This doesn't exactly seem like smuggling, but the trick is that Boom Boom's race is never treated as an issue by Henry or Willie, and thus the character is not dependent on race as a story issue or plot point. Every one of the movie's characters is so richly drawn by the script and cast with foreshadowing, one-liners based in a character's telling of half-truths about themselves, and a definite physicality. Indeed, Lemmon's character is based entirely upon whether or not he will move certainly parts of his body or not before the lawsuit is carried out, yet it's also Matthau who gives Gingrich a hilarious loose-jointed embellishment, a caricature of the sort of shady, get-rich-quick-obsessed uncle. Judi West, a little-known blonde with an appealing physicality of her own who plays Lemmon's ex-wife, lends a certain ambiguity on which Lemmon's teetering moral scales hinge. It's easy to be blinded by curves, even if they belong to someone who's proved distrustful in the past.The film is special in its then-innovative employment of intercutting television footage, which is a technique that has become common since that is very difficult to do without nearly shattering the visual feel of a movie. Wilder, who doggedly refuses to make the audience conscious that anything exists but the forces within the frame, welds the two together gracefully within the subtly important black-and-white grain of the cinematography. Like the Woody Allen of his day, Billy Wilder had a knack for taking complicated, troublesome dilemmas and tragic social states and handling them smoothly and accessibly. We are sucked in, and whatever Wilder wants to tell us, we trust it, because we enjoy it so much.

This means you loose a lot of action and battle scenes, but it is replaced with a great plot and the view of what goes on before and during the battle in order to make sure you get the advantage. The acting is also very good giving you a very believable sense of what it would be like to be a captain, or a commanding officer for Japan. Overall this is a good movie and it is a movie that anyone who likes war movie has to see. It is also one of the more well known movies so its worth seeing just so you can talk about it and have a good conversation with other war movie junkies. So i would say this weekend go out and rent Midway, its a great movie and is worth watching.

The acting is also very good giving you a very believable sense of what it would be like to be a captain, or a commanding officer for Japan. Overall this is a good movie and it is a movie that anyone who likes war movie has to see. It is also one of the more well known movies so its worth seeing just so you can talk about it and have a good conversation with other war movie junkies. So i would say this weekend go out and rent Midway, its a great movie and is worth watching.

But it is a lot more than that. If you watch carefully, this is an incredibly honest, revealing and touchingly sensitive film on teenage identity crisis and identity search interacting with social influences. It tells you more than any psychology book could tell on adolescence, because one cannot put all that into words. Natasha Lyonne as 17 year old Megan (the heroine of the story) demonstrates amazing qualities of acting in a role which is probably the most demanding any actor or actress can face that of a changing adolescent personality re-discovering one's inner, formerly suppressed unconscious self over two months, while still remaining herself in a way. If you compare her different faces at different phases of the story, e.g. when she just cannot think of anything at the camp, and when she looks into the bathroom mirror much later in the film washing her teeth, you will see what I mean. If you are not distracted by hilariously funny bits and jokes and you do not consider poor acting by Cathy Moriarty, it is in fact a top quality drama made superbly. Intimate conversations between the two leading actors (Natasha Lyonne and Clea DuVall) tell more in one minute of this film about life than most movie star celebrities do throughout their whole career. Natasha Lyonne should have received an Oscar for this as best actress, and she should have been offered leading roles in less superficial films than American Pie. A talent wasted. Her performance in this film is an extraordinary achievement and a very touching experience for anyone sensitive enough to resonate to it. I highly recommend it for re-watching it several times you will not get bored if you are attentive enough.

The rain is constantly falling in the crumbling, apocalyptic city, and as sick and brutal as John Doe's grisly murders may be, he's only holding a mirror up to our own guilt and depravity. No one is innocent anymore.I loved the fact that Fincher has no fear of the dark, and that he boldly, bravely lets the movie end unhappily because... because maybe life ends unhappily. I can't speak for you but my life is much closer to chaos than an upbeat TV crime wrap-up The killer confessed and was sentenced to life and Mrs. Mantovanni got her puppies back. Hang on while I vomit.This is not a perfect film by any means... Fincher was still mastering the craft of storytelling Paltrow's secret luncheon late in the film raises red flags all over creation, but the crisp cinematography and filthy visuals are a wonder to behold. Pitt and Freeman do everything possible to avoid just another black\/white, old\/young buddy-cop partnership and its a testament to their abilities that they surely succeed. John Doe shows us serial killing as not just preaching but high art... and he and Fincher get every detail just right the psychosis of the notebooks, the insanity of the fingerprints, the stained bloody shirt and calculated surrender. Even the Nine Inch Nails track in the titles spoke to the mood of violence and industrial rage that at the time was not only hip but palpable.If you haven't seen it yet get good for a downer, abandon all hope and kiss your loved ones goodbye. Don't worry- you can trust in Fincher, Freeman and Pitt to take you through the best bad dream you'll ever have. Now I gotta go that's UPS at the door.GRADE A ","genre":null},{"date":"18 March 2009","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" My brother and I were still under 18 when Showgirls was released, so after being denied access on opening night by a ticket boy who thought he was the Terminator we slipped into David Fincher's Se7en, having no idea what it was or what to expect.Surely the best serial killer story of all-time, this was bleak upon dark upon black upon evil.
