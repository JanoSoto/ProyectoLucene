For starters, as others have pointed out, the movie has a distinct stagey quality to it. Obviously it was based off of a play and that might account for it. It even used many of the same actors from the play. Still, one would think a veteran film director like Mervyn LeRoy would do a better job adapting it to a different medium. Another complaint I have is something that is generally seen as one of the film's positives the performance of Eileen Heckart. She was even nominated for an Oscar for her performance. However, to me she is very over the top and unbelievable. My previous experience with Mrs. Heckart was mostly from her television work, which I always found enjoyable. Here her role is that of a grieving mother driven to drink. She is drunk in all of her scenes I believe. That exaggerated drunken behavior might play well for the stage, but on screen it comes across as a little cartoonish for such serious material.Still, despite minor problems the movie works and works well. It moves along at a good pace, telling the creepy and sometimes chilling story of this little girl who is born evil. Time and countless other films about evil kids might lessen the impact of this story just a bit for some, but I find it all holds up quite well. Rhoda Penmark is rotten through and through. You find her annoying at first, then quickly realize there's something unnerving about her. Some might find fault with the concept of genetic evil and reject the film on that basis alone. I don't necessarily adhere to it myself but it doesn't bother me to explore alternative ideas or theories, especially in works of fiction.One final note another complaint I've seen is that the movie changes the ending of the play and novel. Without spoiling that for you, I'll just say both endings have merit but I actually think the movie ending works best.

Imagine going to a movie in the 50's, with a friend, popcorn, drink and candy and this comes on. It doesn't get any better than this except...You can do this now on your home screen and even better still...watch it again and again.

What makes this movie so compelling is that while it is unfolding, you cannot help but think about what is being presented. It makes sense, is possible and we want it to be so too. Because of how it is done, you feel you are in the movie with the players, tracking the ants and fighting for survival. It is not hard to do either. It has the right tugging emotions, the memorable scenes and the wanting to know more aspects of it which to me spelled sequel in any language. One wonders why they didn't set it up at the time. See the ending and wonder about this yourself. In order for this to be remade, relaying on a good script and decent acting would be mandatory because we already know we can create giant vicious ants no problem. Also, it would have to take place in the early part of the century or even the late 1800's so that the ants have a fighting chance and we get a 2 hour plus thrill ride. For now, enjoy this well made jewel of a good movie, with plot and suspense uninterrupted too.

HOCUS POCUS is a film I remember seeing when it was first released. I still remember walking out of the theater hating it and I honestly never planned to revisit it until several friends started talking about how much they loved it. It appears that the film gained a pretty good cult following over the years due to countless television showings around Halloween time but sadly the end result isn't nearly as good as some make it out to be. The film has some good ideas but none of them are really brought out to their full potential for a number of reasons but we'll start with the screenplay. The screenplay to this has a pretty good set-up or at least an interesting idea. Three witches return on Halloween night and aren't used to anything around them. This here leads to a couple good scenes where the witches meet others in costumes and don't fully realize what's going on. There's a scene with a man dressed as the devil, which is pretty funny since the witches think he's the real thing. Another decent moment happens when Midler gets to sing the 1956 song I Put a Spell on You but of course there's some nice eye candy as we see all sorts of costumes dancing to the music. On a visual level the film is pretty good as it does at least catch the spirit of Halloween and there's no question that the set design perfectly captures the seasons. With that said, there's really not too much going on here because the story is rather lacking and one-note. The worst thing for me is the fact that all three witches are rather annoying and I couldn't help but want to scratch my eyes out at times. I think one's enjoyment of this will depend on how you find the witches. As I found them annoying it made the entire film's comedy just seem way too forced. I'm guessing those who find the act charming will be laughing at it. The three lead actresses all do fine work in their roles but poor Midler is hidden by some ugly buck teeth and it's hard to look past that. The kid actors, including Thora Birch, are good if not totally award-worthy. HOCUS POCUS wasn't a huge hit when it was released and the critics hate it. The film was forgotten but like many films like this, it's cult audience eventually found it on television. The movie isn't awful but then again I wouldn't watch it again unless I really cared for someone wanting me to watch it with them.

It was inevitable that when he finally decided to do his next film it was going to be impossible to top this high water mark. It also didn't help that this film came out in the summer of 1993, one of the most crowded summer box office blockbuster seasons and had to compete against Steven Spielberg's truly stunning Jurassic Park. Unfortunately for this film this rather funny and very enjoyable attempt to satirise the Hollywood action genre was too clever for that summer's audience, who want summer blockbusters to be plain entertaining (particular those starring Schwarzenegger), and watching a satire of the genre implies also satirising the audience that watches that film, which is a very brave, if not slightly foolhardy decision when talking of a film costing around $60-65 million dollars. This is because an audience is either unlikely to get the joke (so don't enjoy the film) or get the joke but don't appreciate it (so don't enjoy the film at all, and actually hate it!) as opposed to the minority that got the joke, and enjoyed the film as a result (this reviewer and by the look of it at least some others!). It also didn't help that two out and out parodies, Hot Shots Part 2 and Loaded Weapon has already destroyed the novelty of an action movie send- up in 1993.

In the alternate reality universe that the lead character Danny Madigan (a solid and entertaining Austin O'Brien, who currently seems to have left acting to become a professional photographer) finds himself in.

Mercedes Ruehl as Danny's mother and the main antagonist Charles Dance who is a lot of fun as the assassin Benedict. There is also a great cameo from Ian McKellen as the Grim Reaper. The film also tries to minimise is useful of visual effects photography, leading to some fun action sequences, which while deliberately stylised are a lot of fun as they are done as far as possible in camera. Miniature and digital effects are present, but service the story and are not there to draw attention to themselves. Due the films crazy 2-3 month post production period, a dozen different visual fx companies were drafted in to ensure the film's visual effects came together in time, and it's a tribute to both the film-makers and visual effects houses that this was pulled off as well as it was.

Great production design, stunt-work. editing, subtle visual effects, and solid and stylish direction from John McTiernan, who has actually created Arnold's most subversive film.

The special effects are now iconic, whilst the acting is subtle and the directing is excellent which help it achieve its renowned status.The story sees two American students David and Jack on a walking tour in Northern England. After leaving a strange pub the two are attacked by a werewolf who kills Jack and injures David, while the locals deny the creatures existence. David ends up in hospital and is plagued by surreal nightmares, as his nurse begins to fall for him. However the deceased Jack starts appearing to him and telling him to commit suicide to release him from the wolfs curse which David now has. The story is told in an unconventional manner that makes it standout the blend of the weird dreams and creepy images with the mystery of the story makes the film very interesting. The plot flows really well and the story itself is always twisting meaning it's difficult to know where it will end.The cast all do solid jobs. David Naughton is extremely convincing as David, playing him in an authentic way as just your everyday person who doesn't know how to react to these bizarre events. He does a great job in adding layers of vulnerability and a witty edge to the character that makes you care about him. Jenny Agutter is very good as Nurse Alex who effectively looks after David for most of the movie. She also puts in a very naturalistic turn as her stunning looks and intelligent demeanour enhance the role. Griffin Dunne is fantastic as Jack, who even in limbo comes off as rather happy-go-lucky. His comic timing is brilliant and always spot-on as he steals the scenes he is in. John Woodvine puts in a very good turn as the intelligent and determined doctor who decides to help David out. Talented character actors Brian Glover and David Schofield are great fun as two of the weary locals.The film flourishes in its smart use of both horror and comedy, as the scary moments are quite terrifying and the comedic pieces are absurdly funny. The dream sequences, which involve Nazi Werewolf's, and the actual wolf attacks themselves are really creepy. The scenes on the moors with the howl as the only sound are very eerie too and create an effective atmosphere. The comic pieces are really funny including Jack's remarks about the dead being boring and David having to escape a zoo without any clothes on. The balance between the two gives the film some great levity to go with the gruesomeness. The effects by Rick Baker are superb and still look great to this day. The transformation sequence remains iconic and the different stages of Jack's decomposing body are delightfully grisly. The songs used, which all have moon in the title, fit in perfectly and the score by Elmer Bernstein is nicely eerie. The ending can be seen as a problem, it is just so abrupt that you don't know how to feel about it. Overall Werewolf is very enjoyable with the perfect balance of horror and humour with wonderful effects.

","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"29 October 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The Dracula novel has seen a ridiculously high amount of film adaptations. But if anyone could bring something new then it probably was acclaimed Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola made some very smart decisions when making the film, mainly deciding to stick closer to the book than most and paying many tributes to the iconic images seen in vampire films of old.The plot does stick quite close to the story. Young solicitor Jonathan Harker travels to Transylvania to sign over land to Count Dracula, who plans on coming to London to wreak havoc. However, upon seeing a picture of Harker's fianc√© he believes her to be his old lover and attempts to win her heart. Although many dislike the added romance it does offer a lot and shows that Dracula does have some kind of soul, making the character more three dimensional. It also adds to the plot as it makes the film more than a struggle against a beast, but a struggle to win the heart of a person. While most argue that Dracula should be a cold monster, I think that it was a wise decision to offer a more sympathetic version as one hadn't been seen before at that point. I'm especially impressed with how the story juggled all of its elements so well, as the romance never felt forced and the scary stuff worked superbly.You can forget about Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee, as Gary Oldman steals the show with ease in an incredible performance as Dracula. He encompasses every single thing he needs to in order to make the role work, he can be both savage and creepy as well as humane and somewhat loving. Oldman made Dracula someone I feared but still felt sorry for , which is no simple task. He is still identifiable in a lot of make-up and the chilling accent is spot-on. Even the way he moves and expresses seem to have been worked to perfection. Should have won an Oscar in my book.The movies biggest stumbling block is with the acting however, seen with a trend of the support outshining the leads, bar Oldman, strangely. Sadie Frost puts a lot of energy in as the seductive Lucy and her feisty nature comes off well. Richard E. Grant is perfect for the part of Dr. Seward and plays the smart doctor well, even if he is underused. Both Cary Elwes and Billy Campbell do solid as can be jobs and make the most of their underdeveloped suitors. Tom Waits was also extremely enjoyable as the insane Renfield.The other three leads are the source of the films main problems for me. Keanu Reeves is horrifyingly bad here, there may actually be planks of wood that have more charisma than him. He is just so wooden in everything he does, his expressions don't convey any of the fear they should and his accent always sounds too fake to be convincing. Winona Ryder never truly convinces either. She just doesn't seem to know how to convey emotion properly and doesn't kind Mina the right depth, but she is just about acceptable. Anthony Hopkins just hams it up as Van Helsing and it comes across as ridiculous (He even humps Billy Campbell's leg at one point).Almost everything else in the film is spot-on. Coppola shot the film in extremely striking and attractive way, as almost every frame oozes richness. The effects are all in camera which is so impressive given the scale of some of them and they still look fantastic to this day, showing CGI isn't always needed. The costume design rightly won an Oscar. Everything fits the Victorian time frame perfectly and it looks beautiful as well as authentic. Dracula's many different costume are also outstanding. The locations look realistic as well, it really captures the gloominess of Victorian London and the makes Transylvania look like a creepy place.The scary scenes were just that and I'd say the film can boast some of the most wildly scary images of any horror centred film since the 80's. The film carries a very Gothic and eerie atmosphere that allows the scary moments to develop more, this is very apparent in the sequences in the castle which are really creepy. Dracula's frequent monstrous forms are demonic and frightening, they are also really well designed and add to terrifying aspects of the character physically. Other times when the film captures a classic horror feel are seen with Harker's encounter of the Brides and the confrontation with Dracula, which both rely on mood to produce terror and it works wonderfully.A lot of praise has to be given to Wojciech Kilar who composes one of the greatest scores I've ever heard. Kilar manages to create a score that has the absolute perfect balance of bone chilling and sweeping beauty. The music feels like it is coming alive at times and enhances certain scenes ten-fold. It is too great to really put into words, but it's one of the few soundtracks that can make you paranoid with fear as well as make you shed a tear of sadness. So does Coppola succeed in making the ideal Dracula movie? I'm going to have to say yes. Whilst I can see that there are aspects people won't enjoy, mainly the romantic sub-plot and some of the poor acting, the film has an extremely high amount of excellent features. The production design, effects and score are some of the very best you will see in film, and visually the film is still a magnificent achievement. It also achieves many of its aims, Gary Oldman is a superb Dracula, the scary moments are very scary and it sticks very close to the book. It may not be the perfect film, but it is extremely well made and very memorable.

It is too great to really put into words, but it's one of the few soundtracks that can make you paranoid with fear as well as make you shed a tear of sadness. So does Coppola succeed in making the ideal Dracula movie? I'm going to have to say yes. Whilst I can see that there are aspects people won't enjoy, mainly the romantic sub-plot and some of the poor acting, the film has an extremely high amount of excellent features. The production design, effects and score are some of the very best you will see in film, and visually the film is still a magnificent achievement. It also achieves many of its aims, Gary Oldman is a superb Dracula, the scary moments are very scary and it sticks very close to the book. It may not be the perfect film, but it is extremely well made and very memorable.

But a big problem arises when gangsters declare that they want the restaurant and the property it's on for themselves. Initially Lung's family are helpless and confused about what to do next, then they find out that Lung is a Kung Fu master. Lung staves off the gangsters by fighting wave after wave of thugs and baddies sent by the higher-ups in the nefarious syndicate. For a while, the restaurant seems secure. But then the bad guys bring out the big guns by calling in Colt (Chuck), an American Martial Arts master who flies to Rome with the sole reason of defeating Lung in a fight. The climax of the movie sees the two titans have it out in the legendary Colosseum. Who will emerge victorious? The Way of the Dragon (or Return of the Dragon, as it was marketed after the success of Enter the Dragon), was a Golden Harvest production written and directed by Bruce Lee, and he also co-produced, starred in, and of course was credited as Action Director and Martial Arts Instructor on the film. Bruce's talent was immense and seemed to be growing at this point in his career; unfortunately for the world, he passed away the next year after the release of this film. Of course, this led to many producers trying to fill the void left by the legend and his huge popularity, leading to such names as Bruce Li, Bruce Le, Dragon Lee, and our personal favorite, Bruce Rhee. Just to name a few. But for our purposes here at Comeuppance, it was nice to actually see a BRUCE LEE film, as opposed to some of the movies that appeared in his wake. It puts things into perspective when you can go back and see the originator, instead of one of the imitators.Don't get us wrong, many of the movies featuring the imitators are fun in their own right and certainly have their charms, but there's nothing like an actual Bruce Lee film, and, sadly, there aren't that many of them to choose from. Here, though, starting from the cool, Spaghetti Western-style animated opening titles sequence, we go into a very 70's world big cars, big collars, pea soup-colored home decor, and of course Bruce Lee was still alive. Maybe someday we'll be able to go back to the 70's. Of course, it was also a time when a young Chuck Norris, sans facial hair (but with plenty of hair everywhere else, as Bruce humorously points out during their fight scene), was just coming on the movie scene. Chuck doesn't appear until about an hour into the movie, as he's the baddies' secret weapon brought in to bring Bruce down, but, like Slaughter in San Francisco (1974), Chuck plays a villain with limited screen time. He had yet to establish himself as a hero, and of course when he comes up against Bruce Lee, the fur's gonna fly! The movie does get off to something of a slow start, and the pacing is kind of odd, especially by today's standards, but really there's no shortage of Bruce action. It was a time when terms like Kung Fu and Nunchucks were brand new in the American (and the non-Asian world's?) lexicon, so that was interesting to see. The dubbing is...unfortunate, but typical for productions of this time and place. That's how it is on the Inter-Vid VHS, and it's unlikely to be any better on many of this movie's other releases. A widescreen, subtitled, remastered DVD would be awesome, but it's probably an impossibility, because of the way the movie was shot. The only other real complaint we have is that it's kind of repetitive, plot-wise, but that's a minor quibble, we're just grateful this film exists in the first place. It would be fascinating to think what Bruce would be doing if he was around today.There's a really good chance he'd be making DTV movies with the action stars of our day like Scott Adkins and Gary Daniels, among others. Or perhaps he'd be making movies in Hong Kong with Jet Li and Donnie Yen. Or maybe both, there's no way of knowing. But Return of the Dragon remains an important part of the Bruce legacy.

It is also my favorite Disney movie, about a Beast (an enchanted prince) who has been losing hope to learn to love and be loved in return in order to break the enchanted spell, until he meets Belle. Belle offers to stay in the castle with the Beast in exchange for her imprisoned father to be set free. What follows is a beautiful love story in how Belle attempts to tame the Beast as he learns the proper manners to be a gentleman from her, and attempting to learn to love and be loved in return.Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise did a marvelous job directing this movie, providing a solid plot that offered a captivating, exciting and heartwarming story of adventure, courage and love. The chemistry between Belle and the Beast will capture your heart and probably put a lump in your throat; it is captured in a way that sent a strong message of changing one's way for the better, humility and acts of selflessness.The characters, especially the enchanted objects, are very lovable and extraordinary, each one giving his\/her own unique charm, including Lumiere, a lovestruck, suave-talking candelabra; Cogsworth, a pompous and prim table clock; Mrs. Potts, the kind-hearted and warm teapot; and Chip, Mrs. Potts' son and an inquisitive teacup. I love the constant competition between Lumiere and Cogsworth as they try to win Belle's liking and command of the castle's duties. All the objects provided the right touch of humor and comedy for a dramatic love story.Alan Menken did a great job on the music score - very spirited, lively and moving. And, my hat is off to some of the greatest songs, by Menken and Howard Ashman, in cinema history Be Our Guest and Beauty and the Beast. Lumiere and Mrs. Potts (Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury) sang Be Our Guest during a grand dinner for Belle. As the enchanted objects performed dances and acrobats to the song, it gave what I think are some of the best pieces of animation work in history. Just the unveiling of the chandelier and the Eiffel Tower forming under a bevy of wineglasses are breathtaking. And, the song Beauty and the Beast, sung by Mrs. Potts (Lansbury), is a beautiful and stirring song that basically summarizes the entire movie - tale as old as time, sweet and strength, finding you can change, Beauty and the Beast. Other memorable characters I like to mention are the conceited and villainous Gaston (Richard White), the slapstick and somewhat clueless LeFou (Jesse Corti) and the brilliant and bold inventor Maurice (Rex Everhart).There is never a slow or dull moment in this movie - it is thoroughly entertaining and exciting from start to finish.

It is seen as one of the greatest films of all time and it's pretty simple to see why. Everything about it is magnificent, the story is one of cinemas finest, the characters are dynamic and well developed, the music is timeless and it captures post-war America\/organised crime era like no other. The story follows the Corleone crime family, the aging head Don Vito wishes to move his family into modern times which corresponds with his youngest son Michael returning from the war and his daughter's wedding. The Don is approached to do a deal with drug dealer Sollozzo, but turns him down which leads to his own fatal shooting. This leads to the aggressive Sonny talking control and Michael, who was set to lead a normal life, being dragged into a mob war that changes the family like no-one could have imagined. The story is brilliant, it's never straightforward and will always keep you guessing as what will happen to the characters. It takes you on a journey, starting at one place and ending a million miles away, but making sure that everything flows and makes sense.Every single cast member nails their role, which is some achievement given the massive amount of characters. Marlon Brando gives one of cinemas greatest characters as the aging Don, everything from the way he speaks to the way he moves is perfectly done. Al Pacino got his breakthrough and he commands the screen. The way he manages to show the subtle changes in the seemingly calm Michael are excellent, he becomes more twisted and less humane as the film goes on. After all it is mainly based on the changes he goes through. James Caan is also brilliant as the hot-headed Sonny, his great screen presence works wonders in showing a man who can't control is anger. Robert Duvall deserves equal praise as the reserved and smart Tom Hagen, a nice alternative to the others. Everyone else is great, from Richard Castellano and Abe Vigoda as Vito right hand men to John Cazale as the frail Fredo to Al Lettieri as the menacing Sollozzo to Diane Keaton as the gentle Kay. The look of the film is fantastic, the cinematography is dark and dimly coloured which helps to reflect the era perfectly. The music is equally fabulous. The main theme is one of the most recognisable of all time and the music does carry an authentic Italian feel. The depth in which Coppola goes to study these characters has to applauded too, giving some of the most well developed characters on the big screen. The way they are different and sometimes polar opposites , the way Sonny lacks control and is aggressive whilst Michael is very much in control and distant. This fascinating aspect helps develop events greatly. The violence makes more sense here, it's done to shape the characters views and set off new events instead of just being there for the sake of it. That idea is what also elevates the film, everything is done for a reason and fits in perfectly with the story giving most of the events much more weight and meaning than usual. The film also excellently sets up events, such as Michael warning Fredo not to side against the family and the move to Nevada, that would be explored in part II. There's not one bad thing about the whole film, one of the few films where that can be said. The Godfather remains incredibly gripping and intriguing all the way through thanks to the epic story, acting and directing.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"29 October 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The Godfather is easily the shining star in the crime genre and 'epic' films in general. It is seen as one of the greatest films of all time and it's pretty simple to see why. Everything about it is magnificent, the story is one of cinemas finest, the characters are dynamic and well developed, the music is timeless and it captures post-war America\/organised crime era like no other. The story follows the Corleone crime family, the aging head Don Vito wishes to move his family into modern times which corresponds with his youngest son Michael returning from the war and his daughter's wedding. The Don is approached to do a deal with drug dealer Sollozzo, but turns him down which leads to his own fatal shooting. This leads to the aggressive Sonny talking control and Michael, who was set to lead a normal life, being dragged into a mob war that changes the family like no-one could have imagined. The story is brilliant, it's never straightforward and will always keep you guessing as what will happen to the characters. It takes you on a journey, starting at one place and ending a million miles away, but making sure that everything flows and makes sense.Every single cast member nails their role, which is some achievement given the massive amount of characters. Marlon Brando gives one of cinemas greatest characters as the aging Don, everything from the way he speaks to the way he moves is perfectly done. Al Pacino got his breakthrough and he commands the screen. The way he manages to show the subtle changes in the seemingly calm Michael are excellent, he becomes more twisted and less humane as the film goes on. After all it is mainly based on the changes he goes through. James Caan is also brilliant as the hot-headed Sonny, his great screen presence works wonders in showing a man who can't control is anger. Robert Duvall deserves equal praise as the reserved and smart Tom Hagen, a nice alternative to the others.

It comes off as a slick and smart film, avoiding the usual action clich√©s and having very intelligent ideas that work. The film is high octane stuff mainly thanks to the interesting premise, excellent performances and superb action set pieces.The plot sees fishermen recover a man's body out at sea with two bullet holes in his back. He is suffering from amnesia and doesn't remember who he was, later discovering his name to be Jason Bourne. A laser device planted in his hip shows him his bank account which is full of money and a gun. Bourne then finds himself hunted by the police and, with the help of a woman named Marie, he searches for answers in Paris which lead all the way to the CIA. The story flows extremely well and has a lot of twists that help in making things more interesting. The general story about Bourne is just an interesting one and you can never really tell where the film is going to end up, which makes it all the more gripping.The cast is exceptional. Matt Damon is excellent as Bourne, perfectly portraying him as confused and conflicted but still very clever. He does a great job of handling the action, intense and emotional scenes with astuteness. Franka Potente is equally good as Marie. She comes off as likable and her normality gives her a realistic edge, she makes for a sensitive and courageous companion for Bourne. Chris Cooper does an incredibly solid job as the CIA man who is tracking Bourne's every move. He shows him as a cold calculating figure without removing all of his humanity. Brian Cox is great as always as the intense Abbott, Cox's sheer presence shows intellect and cunning. Julia Stiles is very good as informer Nicky. Clive Owen is very good too as the stoic assassin the 'Professor'.The action scenes are brilliant. The fights scenes are a lot more realistic than most films, which makes them fast, exciting and surprisingly brutal. The fight with the would-be assassin and the climax in particular are excellently shot. The car chase is a highlight, it just feels naturally gritty while still being a thrilling and entertaining set piece. The characters are well fleshed out which is something most action films miss out on. Bourne is an interesting person and as he finds out more so do the audience, he eventually does feel like a real spy and thanks to Damon's intense portrayal he does appear to be fighting for his life. The same goes for the realism as the characters do come across as somewhat vulnerable. The film itself is shot really well, it captures Paris very beautifully and espionage atmosphere is nicely heavy. Its surprising how well paced it is, it seemingly moves quickly but still has time to add hints of melancholy and emotion to the story itself. It is a brilliant style of relying on story and characters with bursts of action and energy, which harken back to older action films. The score by John Powell is great as it is both nicely moody and rather exhilarating when it needs to be. The Bourne Identity is tense, thrilling and emotive in equal doses as its one of the finest spy films around.

This caused heavy damage to Japanese cities, namely Tokyo and morale too, the Japanese now knew they were no longer invincible to American attack and planned to attack Midway, a small island just off of Hawaii, hoping to draw the American forces out into the open and obliterate them. The Japanese hoped to also occupy Midway in order to extend their defensive perimeter, therefore enabling them to repel future American attacks, the battle that would decide this provides the basis for this film,MIDWAY,made in 1976.First of all, I fail to understand why everyone hate this movie so much, nearly every reviewer on IMDb bashes it.I thought this movie was awesome,I really enjoyed it and was absolutely awestruck by the way it was filmed and put together. The cast and crew seemed to have put a huge amount of effort into making the film and looked to have given it all they had and what do they get for their pains?, nothing but stick, the film as a whole looked extremely ambitious. Even though it does appear a little cheap, I'd rather have this film over the CGI crap of today, but that's just my opinion.MIDWAY depicts the battle superbly and the battle scenes in the film are just spectacular. Real battle footage and footage from other war movies is used to an amazing advantage, the first battle where the Japanese attack the airstrip on Midway was just fantastic, even though half of it was taken from TORA!TORA!TORA!(1970),the shots of the Machine Gun being fired, Trucks furiously exploding and crashing and a watchtower crashing to the ground were excellent. The two main air battles,especially the first one where the American planes battle it out with Japanese planes and a Japanese battleship really blew me away. The final 3 battles were the best parts of the movie, my favourite one being the first where the American dive bombers destroy 3 Japanese battleships whilst being bombarded with heavy Cannon and Anti-aircraft fire was exciting and really impressive, the explosions were so epic and realistic. The second battle where the Japanese attack the Yorktown was equally impressive and spectacular, watch out for the part where a Japanese Zero comes crashing into the ship's bridge(which is taken from Universal's very own AWAY ALL BOATS from 1956),causing an explosion and engulfing it in flames, again the shots of the heavy artillery giving the Japanese planes hell are ear shatteringly magnificent. The final explosive battle in which Charlton Heston's character and a squadron of Dive bombers destroy and sink the last remaining Japanese battleship was riveting and packed with adrenaline.The special effects were outstanding,especially during the final 3 battles, the shots of the planes and battleships exploding were extremely exhilarating, as were the shots of flames tearing across the decks of the ravaged battleships. The use of real World war two footage was a great idea and looks remarkable spliced into the battle scenes, the fact that this footage is in colour makes it ten times better, this footage was expertly chosen. I was really impressed with the images of Cannons and Anti-aircraft guns bombarding and battling it out with attacking aircraft but what really looked amazing were the shots of two different aircraft crash landing and exploding on the deck of the aircraft carrier.John William's soundtrack is excellent and gives the film a modern feel as does the camera-work, the way certain shots linger add to the seriousness of the film. The acting is top notch, Charlton Heston is perfect as the main character and other stellar performances come from Henry Fonda, James Coburn, Glenn Ford, Hal Holbrook, Robert Mitchum,Cliff Robertson and Toshiro Mifune.Yes,the dialogue does get corny at times, but that's only to be expected of a Hollywood war movie. The romantic subplot between the American pilot and the Japanese girl was irrelevant to the plot but soon becomes forgotten about as the planning and battle scenes take over, so it doesn't spoil the film.MIDWAY is a terribly underrated and spectacular war drama packed with some of the greatest action scenes ever seen in a movie, explosive special effects and excellent acting also compliment the film and make it definitely worth watching, MIDWAY is up there with all the other war classics.10\/10.

It effectively takes all the elements from the first and makes them bigger and more complex, as well as revolutionising the idea of flashbacks. The plot is possibly the greatest of all time, the characters are more diversely fascinating and everything feels even more epic than before.The plot is split in two, one following the Corleone family in modern day and the other early life of Vito. The first follows Michael who is now Don as he attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas. He faces much dissatisfaction in his own family, from Capo Frank Pentangeli and his own sister. He later survives an assassination attempt, and as he tries to learn who made the attempt he also faces a committee investigation that tears his family apart. This story is one of the best in film history, everything about it is incredibly set-up. The second charts the young life of Vito Corleone as he raises his family in New York and aims to build his own legacy. This sees him challenge the local Don and gain friends to help him achieve his goal. This part gives us a true insight into how all of what we're seeing started and is a fantastic mirror image to the modern events. The huge cast is once again truly outstanding. Al Pacino gives an incredible performance as we see Michael transform into a cold monster who has no feelings for his family. The way Pacino shows the struggle as he edges closer to the abyss is astonishing. The other star is John Cazale as Fredo, he is outstanding as the timid Fredo, the chemistry between himself and Pacino sets their scenes alight. Robert Duvall is solid as a rock once again as the reserved Tom, while Diane Keaton is great showing Kay as confused and frightened of her situation. Michael V. Gazzo is superb as Frank showing him as a genuinely troubled person. Richard Bright deserves praise as, despite few lines, he commands the screen as the loyal but brutal Al Neri. Joe Spinell is great as the doubtful Cicci as is Lee Strasberg as the devious Hyman Roth. Robert De Niro made his name here, he plays Vito with assured comfort and is just as good as Brando, which is praise itself. The film looks stunning. It is lit similar to the first and carries the same gloomily authentic feel being very atmospheric. The scenes of early New York and of Sicily are both excellent having a very natural look to them. The music from Nino Rota is once again marvellous. The script is full of classic lines, Keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer and I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies to name but two. It's great how the film focuses more on Michael and it's reflected by the look at Vito. Michael grows increasingly paranoid and unstable as he places the family business above all else. We see the differences in how the family is set. Vito's was built on loyalty and love, whereas Michael's family is built on fear and violence. It is a fascinating contrast which the film itself is built on, the whole scope is formed from this showing the pleasant start of the family and then it's tragic fall. There are so many classic scenes, Michael finding out the traitor, Kay's pregnancy reveal, all of the conversations with Fredo, the scenes at the hearing and the famous 'fishing trip' to name a few. The final shot of Michael sitting alone is one of the most memorable of all time.The Godfather Part II is a breath taking achievement in film and has possibly the greatest story ever put on screen.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"29 October 2013","score":"","review":" You would probably find this film very cheesy, but also pretty darn fun. This is your typical mid-90's action B-film that lacks the brains, but certainly not the brawn. I enjoyed this film very much for what it is and I came away with a smile on my face. It's obvious that the actors were having fun and were giving it all they got. Yes, the special effects may not be the best, but I'm not complaining.Martin Campbell's film is set in the near future and we meet a former Marine named John Robbins who is sent to life imprisonment because he murdered his commanding officer. He is sent by the Warden to an island full of savages and now it's his goal to escape without being killed.The acting was pretty good for the kind of film it is. The actors were definitely having a fun time with the film. Ray Liotta is a great, underrated actor. I liked seeing some B-name stars like Lance Henriksen, Stuart Wilson, and Ernie Hudson. They really add to the campy, fun feel of the film.Overall, this is a good film that is good to watch on any weekend or when you're not in a serious film-watching mood. I would just shut my brains off and enjoy the film as it is, rather than picking it apart like people like to do. This is a fun film and that's all it is. It's full of crazy action, stunts, some mild humor, and some cool sci-fi. I rate this film 9\/10.

A lot different from the Roger Moore TV series, it sort of follows the Brosnan Bonds in being a stylish actioner with a slightly absurd plot. Yet it's a very entertaining film with many great things about it. The plot involves Simon Templar who is a master a thief, being able to outsmart the law with unique disguises and accents. He is hired by the Russian Mafia to steal a formula for cold fusion energy from scientist Emma Russell. But Russell intelligence and beauty makes Templar begin to develop feelings for her that he can't walk away from. He decides to help her and must work out the formula before the Russians do. Though the plot is a bit silly, it is actually pretty smart in many places and it never becomes boring. As said it works like one of the more far-fetched Bond films in that it is rather suspect but it doesn't really matter because it is so entertaining, whilst the romantic side keeps things nicely grounded.The cast is impressive. Val Kilmer is terrific as Templar managing to play the smart spy who finds his softer side and he has the charisma to carry it off. Kilmer does a brilliant job at doing different accents and changing appearance too. Elisabeth Shue is excellent as Emma Russell, making her likable and tough but with complexity and issues. Rade Serbedzija makes an effect villain as the slimy and power hungry Tretiak. Valeriy Nikolaev was a little dull as his son, but still believable and did well in the action set pieces. The British veteran Michael Byrne was fantastic as always as Tretiak's adviser. Both Alun Armstrong and Charlotte Cornwell did solid jobs as inspectors on Templar's trail. Though the plot is iffy, nearly everything else is done quite competently. The visual tone that the film goes for is very stylish, the scenes of Russia and Britain look fantastic. The action scenes are also done in a great way, though it doesn't happen too often when it does it is nicely effective. The music is simply superb, the score by Graeme Revell has a cool action tone to it but is also very beautiful, the main theme and 'Love Theme' are both superb. The use of more contemporary music at times was also a smart decision. The most effective thing about the film is the relationship between Templar and Russell. Val Kilmer and Elisabeth Shue have amazing chemistry as a lot of the time you can easily forget they are acting it's so natural. This side of the story helps make it far more interesting that your average action film because you actually care about what these people go through. It's also nice that there's not an overload of action, as the film does a good job of letting the drama tell the story. Overall The Saint offers a refreshing balance of drama, action and character development. ","genre":null},{"date":"29 October 2013","score":"","review":" The Saint is a pleasantly surprising film.
