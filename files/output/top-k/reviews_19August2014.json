[{"date":"19 August 2014","score":"","review":" 'The Iron Giant' is a breath of fresh air. At one point while viewing it I whispered to my friend seated next to me 'I am REALLY enjoying this'. The reason behind that statement is that most animated films these days seem to have been made with great skill and take us to places we could only imagine but their stories fall like a stone I have not been impressed by many of Disney's latest forays sans the 'Toy Story' movies and the breathtaking 'Hunchback of Notre Dame'. 'The Iron Giant' is not a Disney film but they could take a lesson from it. Here is a charming film that strips away the usual pretenses of animated features and flat out tells a good story.The story begins in October 1957, the night the whole world has its eyes open for Sputnik orbiting overhead. Out of the sky comes an alien from another world. A 100-foot metal-munching behemoth that is first seen eating straps of metal and eventually eats his way to the local the power plant.One of the pieces is a TV antenna belonging to Hogarth, a little boy living in a big house with his single mom. Just like the boy in another movie about a creature from space, he goes to investigate. He saves the giant from munching on power-lines and the two become friends.Naturally, Hogarth has to keep this enormous creature a secret from his mother and eventually from the government agents who come looking for it. What I appreciated most about 'The Iron Giant' was the care given to the smaller moments.Consider a scene in which the creature's hand comes off and runs around the house while Hogarth tries to keep his mother from seeing it. He opens the bathroom door and there is the hand stumbling around like a puppy with its wires wagging like a tail. Those are the kind of moments that fill the screen in 'The Iron Giant'. They aren't necessary to the story but I appreciate the efforts of the animators to take that extra step.The characters are fun too. Besides Horgarth there is a beatnik named Dean (Given a very daddy-o by Harry Connick Jr.) a dim-bulbed federal agent (Chris McDonald) and Hogarth's mother who isn't given the stereo-typical 'Go to your room' sternness but comes off as a woman genuinely concerned about her son.But I am forgetting the star of the show. The Iron Giant himself begins as a creature who doesn't understand the world that he had dropped into gradually gathers an understanding of love and friendship from Hogarth. He begins as a metal-munching monster and then understands humanity.He makes mistakes as in one thrilling scene in which he bends a railroad track just as the train approaches. He doesn't speak for most of the movie but when he does it is in a very low monotone with selective words. I also loved the look of the creature, his steam-shovel mouth and brawny frame look as if he has stepped right off the covers of those old science fiction magazines.I loved the Iron Giant for so many reasons. This is a movie trying to be different. It doesn't try to be a carbon copy of a Disney film. Dancing dishes and furry sidekicks are fine but personally I liked a movie like this, a movie with its feet on the ground and its heart &#x96; as well as its script &#x96; in the right place.

So when a barn spider befriends a lonely pig, an odd couple is born which serves a purpose for both of their lives. This animated movie, often overlooked because it wasn't a Disney film, retains a special place in many people's heart because it is a movie with a heart, and even if we can't get inside the brain or hearts of the barn animals seen here, we can look at them in a different light than just something who oinks, clucks, snorts, moos or only comes out at night after the humans who might kill them go to bed.Charlotte's Web is a beautiful story of Wilbur, the runt of a litter almost killed, nursed back to health by an innocent young girl, then returned to his pen in order to serve his purpose to man. That means becoming either a chop or side of ham, and while the other animals can have a purpose without being slaughtered, Wilbur fears his days are numbers. This is where Charlotte comes in, the small spider who begins to chit-chat with him until she is ready to reveal who she is. Charlotte likes Wilbur and agrees to help him avoid the slaughterhouse. So one day when the owners come out, they are stunned to see Wilbur standing underneath the web with the words Some Pig written in it. Of course, these rather dumb humans instantly believe that he wrote it, and an instant celebrity is born.Laugh-In's Henry Gibson provides the voice of the sweet Wilbur with plucky Debbie Reynolds a delightful Charlotte. They are surrounded by well known actors as their barn-yard friends, including Agnes Moorehead as a grouchy goose, Paul Lynde as the constantly hungry rat Templeton, and Dave Madden as the very serious ram. Reynolds goes back to the type of gregarious teen role she had played at MGM, singing the uplifting Chin Up, and dueting with Gibson on We've Got Lots In Common where they affirm their friendship. Things get more profound as time decreases for the aging Charlotte, Reynolds bringing on tears in Mother Earth and Father Time. To alleviate the sadness coming on, Lynde gets a country fair production number, milking every moment for laughs with his song of gluttony. Wilbur himself gets a big production number, sung to him as if he was one of Jerry Herman's big Broadway heroines, Dolly or Mame.The Sherman Brothers who created some wonderful songs for Disney do the same thing here for this, although the beautiful title song did not get an Oscar Nomination. I always envisioned this being a big Broadway musical and longed to see Reynolds on stage as narrator and singing that song, but all I ended up with was a 2006 remake that lacks the heart of this animated version.

It came out shortly before I was born and I have been watching it ever since I was old enough to know what a movie is. Emerging with the many other well-done Disney films of the 90's, Aladdin stands out as my personal favorite because it has literally everything I look for in a good Disney movie a good story, a likable male lead, a beautiful and equally likable female lead, a hilarious comic relief character, a memorable and intimidating villain and, of course, numerous catchy songs. Aladdin has all of these. For those of you who, somehow, don't know the story, this movie centers around a young man named Aladdin. Aladdin is a homeless thief living in the fictional Arabian city of Agrabah and is constantly ducking the guards. One day, he comes across the beautiful princess of Agrabah, Jasmine, who has fled the palace because she is tired of never having any freedom. The two meet and instantly begin to hit it off, but shortly after, Aladdin is captured by the town guard. Whilst in the dungeon, Aladdin is greeted by Jafar, the royal adviser and secretly an evil sorcerer. Jafar tricks Aladdin into going into the mystic Cave of Wonders to retrieve a magical lamp, but Aladdin's monkey friend, Abu, attempts to steal a giant ruby, causing the sentient cave to become angry and collapse. While trapped in the cave, Aladdin discovers that the lamp contains a magical genie that will grant him three wishes. Aladdin uses the wishes to try to win the princess's heart and prevent the evil Jafar from gaining ultimate power. What really can I say about this movie? It's just a blast to watch. The songs are all catchy and will get stuck in your head, the characters are all lovable and not at all annoying, the story is engaging and coherent, the action sequences work, and the Genie, played by the late Robin Williams, is absolutely hilarious! I'll be honest with you, I can't find any downside to this movie, to do so would require some major head-scratching and nitpicking. If you haven't seen Aladdin yet, you definitely should, it's one of Disney's best.

It's so interesting that I'm actually talking about it. Rather than what one usually sees, which is clips that occur well within 30 seconds or less of each other, The Player goes out of its way to present one of the most long-winded and continuous shots, with a slowly panning camera around a film studio. As the camera makes its round, we are treated to the sight of at least forty extras going about their usual business. Ideas are being pitched, employees are being reprimanded, producers lay back and seem unmoved by anything and it goes on and on for almost a full ten minutes. Ten minutes of continuous shot. Needless to say, it already makes itself highly stylized in its opening scene and also represents the turmoil of a film producer. Which is what the film is about.So, during this opening shot, we actually do see our main character, a tough and shrewd producer. He's not like many of the main characters I've seen before. He's an executive; part of the faceless mass of a company. He's a producer, notorious for playing it safe and only publishing films he knows the public will buy tickets for. Action films, with happy endings and Bruce Willis as the lead. He's living the good life of an executive. He's on schedule, the boss' favorite, dating his secretary and enjoying his wealth. Essentially, he's exactly the sort of person we tend to blame all our economic issues on; the 1% if you will.However, all is not well in his life, as he's been receiving postcards, with threats written all over them, by a mysterious film maker he seemingly rejected. This isn't entirely surprising. As an executive who runs through about 1000 pitches a year, he can't afford to say yes to all of them, so he has a hard time making friends with writers. But this particular sender seems to want to kill the producer, so he's rightfully scared when he receives a stack of about fifty at once, all of them carrying inscriptions of how much the writer hates him. The film folds on from there, and there are a few very interesting plot twists and turns, as well as some rather crowbar plot moves that seem to be there solely for symbolism or because the script writer thought it would look cool on camera.The Player is a different film. It's not as kind as most other films are to its protagonist, nor is it even full of very much action, though it does have a bit of romance. The film is oddly unconventional while conforming to many clichés. It seems to do so with a certain sense of irony, but it doesn't always work in the film's favor, as these moments can seem out of place and awkwardly handled. That and the romance in the film isn't really what I wanted to see in any way, though part of my suspects that's what it's supposed to be like. There's also something about the entire plot's premise that seems a little heavy handed. But there are some really fantastic moments, which make it all worthwhile. If you haven't seen the film, I'd recommend at least giving it a fling. I can't guarantee this is the kind of movie you'll want to watch again and again, but it's worth viewing.

Everyone has seen this movies and knows it quite well as much as its famous sequel Terminator 2 Judgment Day. I don't know if I had anything new to say about this movie because everyone already knows well about The Terminator and why its so darn good about it. This movie was directed by James Cameron who would go on to make the second Terminator movie along with the second Alien movie, The Abyss, True Lies, Titanic, and now Avatar. I know that Cameron considered this movie to be his first film because his previous film Piranha II The Spawning, was going to be but some random people of the movie took over and wasn't like the way the Cameron envision it. So he just ignores that movie and considers The Terminator as his first film because he had more control than he had with the second Piranha movie. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, which it was his first time to play a villain and he really does a fascinating job to not only he embodied the character, but making it such a memorable role. He is the Terminator. Michael Biehn was also great as Kyle Reese along side with Linda Hamilton as John Connor's mother Sarah. The movie really does go at a really good pace, and it does keep you on the edge of your seat. The music by Brad Fiedel is one of the greatest scores that has ever been heard in this kind of movie with the use of synthesizer, and featuring the famous Terminator Theme. The special effects in this movie are really good in this movie, especially with the design of the Terminator by the great Stan Winston. The effects are no Terminator 2, but they are still really good before there was any CGI as what most filmmakers are using by today's special effects. The story is really well told and very effective as the premise goes along without any subplots or any of that mumble jumble. All it is that one is really trying to protect Sarah Connor, while the other to terminate and that is all you need for a story like this. The Terminator is a classic movie of the 80s that mixes with action, horror, and science fiction. If you haven't seen this movie, check it out! I give this movie a 10 out of 10.

Evidently the campaign, initiated months before the film's release, was a success as Warner Brothers' tale of an impeding apocalypse wrought upon the earth by the birth of The Antichrist as foretold in the Book of Revelations was a huge commercial hit and can still raise a shiver even today.In the movie Gregory Peck plays Robert Thorn, an American ambassador who is approached by a mysterious priest who offers him a baby boy when his pregnant wife suffers a stillborn delivery. Thorn accepts the boy and the family are then transferred to England where things are fine until five years later when disturbing events begin to occur which suggest that the ambassador's son, Damien, is a chip off a much more sinister block. The ambassador is then tracked down by an eccentric priest blabbering about the end-of-the-world and Damien's role as The Antichrist. Initially dismissive, Thorn gradually comes to believe the priest's eschatological spiel when more people die and he discovers a birthmark on Damien's head in the shape of 666, the number of the beast, and decides to do what he can to avert the coming apocalypse.Following on from the Big Budget clout of earlier demonic problem-child horror 'The Exorcist' (1973), 'The Omen' seemed to take the lifeblood of its success from the deeply buried fear that there may actually be something in all of those un-listened to Sunday-school sermons drowning in the public's unconscious. With this lingering religious fear in the background, and accentuated by the ominous and Oscar winning score by Jerry Goldsmith, the hysterical atmosphere created by the film is enough to suspend even the most atheistic viewer's disbelief and remains my abiding impression of the film beyond any of the particularities of the plot. However, in saying this there is an implied criticism which makes the film merely watchable to good and nowhere near great; namely, while the film has atmosphere in spades and the kills are imaginative, the script hangs lifelessly off these good points and makes the film feel flabby and even dull at points.Perhaps, the reason for this is that whereas the two other films in the unholy trinity of demon-child horrors 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968) and 'The Exorcist' were both adapted from source novels, the genesis (pun intended) of 'The Omen' came from a realisation producer Harvey Bernhard had that the fundamentalist prophecies his born-again Christian friend would spout during conversations were in fact paranoid horror fantasies ideal for a movie. He then enlisted the help of screenwriter David Seltzer to flesh out the idea. However, in later years, Seltzer has been open about taking on the project solely due to needing money and maybe this absence of artistic commitment (so abundant in the other two films) is what explains the flabby through-line. As such, 'The Omen' lacks the Luciferian splendour of the 'Rosemary's Baby', and lacks the subtext of theological doubt that 'The Exorcist' author William Peter Blatty was wrestling with (although it shares the charge of Christian propaganda).So, while Damien would surely get a B- in his Satanic seminary, with his teacher despairing that he has potential but just isn't applying himself, it's still a pass grade higher than many others in the class.

","genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"19 August 2014","score":"","review":" &#x85;so went the end-times paranoia marketing campaign for 'The Omen'. Evidently the campaign, initiated months before the film's release, was a success as Warner Brothers' tale of an impeding apocalypse wrought upon the earth by the birth of The Antichrist as foretold in the Book of Revelations was a huge commercial hit and can still raise a shiver even today.In the movie Gregory Peck plays Robert Thorn, an American ambassador who is approached by a mysterious priest who offers him a baby boy when his pregnant wife suffers a stillborn delivery. Thorn accepts the boy and the family are then transferred to England where things are fine until five years later when disturbing events begin to occur which suggest that the ambassador's son, Damien, is a chip off a much more sinister block. The ambassador is then tracked down by an eccentric priest blabbering about the end-of-the-world and Damien's role as The Antichrist. Initially dismissive, Thorn gradually comes to believe the priest's eschatological spiel when more people die and he discovers a birthmark on Damien's head in the shape of 666, the number of the beast, and decides to do what he can to avert the coming apocalypse.Following on from the Big Budget clout of earlier demonic problem-child horror 'The Exorcist' (1973), 'The Omen' seemed to take the lifeblood of its success from the deeply buried fear that there may actually be something in all of those un-listened to Sunday-school sermons drowning in the public's unconscious. With this lingering religious fear in the background, and accentuated by the ominous and Oscar winning score by Jerry Goldsmith, the hysterical atmosphere created by the film is enough to suspend even the most atheistic viewer's disbelief and remains my abiding impression of the film beyond any of the particularities of the plot. However, in saying this there is an implied criticism which makes the film merely watchable to good and nowhere near great; namely, while the film has atmosphere in spades and the kills are imaginative, the script hangs lifelessly off these good points and makes the film feel flabby and even dull at points.Perhaps, the reason for this is that whereas the two other films in the unholy trinity of demon-child horrors 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968) and 'The Exorcist' were both adapted from source novels, the genesis (pun intended) of 'The Omen' came from a realisation producer Harvey Bernhard had that the fundamentalist prophecies his born-again Christian friend would spout during conversations were in fact paranoid horror fantasies ideal for a movie. He then enlisted the help of screenwriter David Seltzer to flesh out the idea. However, in later years, Seltzer has been open about taking on the project solely due to needing money and maybe this absence of artistic commitment (so abundant in the other two films) is what explains the flabby through-line. As such, 'The Omen' lacks the Luciferian splendour of the 'Rosemary's Baby', and lacks the subtext of theological doubt that 'The Exorcist' author William Peter Blatty was wrestling with (although it shares the charge of Christian propaganda).So, while Damien would surely get a B- in his Satanic seminary, with his teacher despairing that he has potential but just isn't applying himself, it's still a pass grade higher than many others in the class.

Eddie Felson, a billiards phenom in his younger days who had been used and tossed away by an unscrupulous gambler, is older and wiser and now acts as the unscrupulous gambler by bankrolling young pool sharks . . .

Vince has a girlfriend named Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) who early on reveals that she has no scruples herself. Uh, wait a minute. In The Hustler Eddie got involved with a girl, took her on a pool\/gambling road trip with his evil gambler mentor and, without giving away the twists of that much better movie, lets just say it ended very badly.

Eddie gives Vince a very valuable cue stick, sort of a gift to convince him to become his protégé. Then he tells Vince to not use it when he plays - any savvy pool player will see it and immediately identify Vince as a hustler. Okay, so why give it to the brash and volatile young Vincent? Of course Vince goes out without Eddie and takes the cue and mucks up Eddie's gambling game plan. Eddie gets mad and drives his car away, with Vince trying to chase him down like a jilted girlfriend. Then Vince gets mad and Eddie gets in his car and chases down Vince, like an older jilted girlfriend. Meanwhile Carmen is disrobing in front of Eddie every chance she gets. Then they all make up. Then the wise, sage pool hustler Eddie Felson devises a con job which involves putting his grubby old guy hands all over Carmen, knowing full well how jealous and insecure Vince is about his relationship with Carmen. This leads to a cringe-worthy scene after the con job in which Vince acts like the immature teenager he obviously is while Carmen and Eddie try to placate his anger by saying, We were just acting! It made me feel a little dirty, watching the great Paul Newman explaining how actors who kiss in movies don't really mean it. Who put these words in his mouth?There's more, including one of Scorcesese's most gratuitous camera spins, doing 360's around Newman like some drunk teenager doing donuts in his souped-up Chevy in a supermarket parking lot, but why continue? This is simply a bad movie, all the more embarrassing because it almost taints the memory of its superior predecessor . . . almost.On the plus side, Newman looks great, MEM is very sexy, and Forrest Whitaker turns up in a great cameo as a slightly crazy pool hustler. His character was more interesting during his brief screen time than anything Newman and Cruise could muster. The rotten cherry on top of this melted pile of ice cream is the fact that THIS is the film for which Newman won his only Oscar.

If there's one thing a sequel should get right, it's sticking to the story it originally told. It has got to and thankfully the filmmakers accomplished that.

Although the style was also parallel, the story was different which helped it stand out from other horror films at the time. Jason Vorhees - who would've known that would become a common name? Of course this wasn't revealed until close to the ending of the first film. Plus, by the ending viewers were introduced to a melancholy ending about where the remains of Mr.Vorhees were. It wasn't the fullest of closure but it did end the tragic story rather well. Apparently Paramount felt that wasn't enough closure.What Part II decides to do is bring the story full circle. This idea is successful in some respects, while at other times the execution leaves more questions instead of answering them. One of the best parts about this sequel is its continuity. If there's one thing a sequel should get right, it's sticking to the story it originally told. It has got to and thankfully the filmmakers accomplished that. This is accomplished by showing and explaining to its audience what happened to the girl from the original. Then, the story sets itself up with a new cast of camp counselors. Unfortunately this is where things began to head south. For one, the characters are flat. There is barely a character that makes themselves feel any different from the last bunch of counselors fans viewed from the first film.Along with that are individual story lines to these characters that go unfinished. Unlike the first entry, which ended with a decent amount of closure (with a few loose ends), this entry misses even more, with absent explanations on a few of the main characters. Ron Kurz writing is very uneven. He keeps continuity but forgets to keep this work in line. As Steve Miner's debut, his direction is fairly predictable sadly on a lot of cases. Much of the execution relies on copying its predecessor with no creativity or uniqueness this time. Not even its cinematography by Peter Stein grabs the attention. Stein likes to keep his cameras hidden in the brush so that its impossible to get a feeling for all the surroundings. There isn't much to be see this time.Besides continuity being one of its strong points, the violence, background concept and music are commendable. Although the gore has been edited quicker, the bloodshed is still heavy and gruesome. The background concept to what happened to Jason and being expanded upon is interesting. It dilutes Jason's motivations a bit and lacks clarity but it still is an eye grabber. Music was again produced by composer Harry Manfredini. For the most part, Manfredini keeps everything the same. Still screeching strings and whispering ghostly voices. It is nice keeping the signature feeling but incorporating some tunes would've been better. It's not a terrible entry but it could've had the bumps smoothed out.The sequel manages to keep clear continuity with its parent yet fails to clear up anything for the current entry. With a cast resembling a carbon copy of its first set of characters, the execution feels too similar except for a few parts like its violence and background concepts.

It's a film that shows that people who cheat on their current lovers aren't just doing it for pleasure but that there are some who actually end up falling in love and have some class with the affair. George Segal plays Steve Blackburn, a wealthy business and family man who meets a mysterious and provocative divorced woman name Vickie Allessio (Glenda Jackson) at a park. Steve visits Vickie at work and convinces her to depart with him to Spain for a romantic love affair. Many things go wrong in the process, such as incidents at the resort, Steve's best friend following him and coming close to finding out the big secret and continuous arguing between the two New Yorkers. The idea of this film is very clever and fun, it's just it gets a little carried away with the whole 'keep it a secret' idea. The lengths and measures Steve and Vickie go through are absolutely ridiculous and the two don't share a strong enough chemistry for us to feel for their relationship. The relationship just drags and drags and becomes repetitive and feels like the same scene you just saw 15 minutes ago. And for those who somehow enjoyed their relationship, you'll be disappointed in the mislead ending the film concludes. There was just too much of the same thing between Vickie and Steve! The two lovebirds fight and argue and try and keep their affair a secret for two long. Glenda Jackson is very irritating and has an accent that sounds like fingernails on a chalkboard. George Segal is actually very funny and Paul Sorvino is a fun friend of his. The film has a decent plot and some very funny moments at times even though Glenda Jackson ruins them and the third or fifth tie the same thing happens it becomes unfunny. The final third of this film is very poor but I must admit the middle of this film was very fun to watch due to the plot being new at the time and the characters still being developed. The opening is weak and the end section is artless, poorly written and a repeat of what we have seen earlier just out of Spain. Melvin Frank the writer and director wanted to make a romantic comedy about a love affair that turned into love and how the two went through extraordinary times to fulfill their love. Instead he got a rom-com that ended on a bad twist and a continuous disaster between a poorly-matched couple who shared some humor at times.

I saw it in theaters (week after Gladiator) and man I was bored to tears from that movie. I saw it again and boy my opinion is still the same. This movie was doomed from the start since the idea of adapting a very outdated book from Scientologist L. Ron Hubbard.Anyway, the story is about a guy named Johnny Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) being captured by an alien race called the Pyschlos (bare with me) who rule the Earth in the year 3000 by scratch and haven't even checked Kentucky (you'll see why when you did survived through the movie like me). If you want to know why, it is because they all want gold (yeah, one of the Pyschlos might be none other than Mr. Goldfinger). The villain of this movie (I think) is none other than Terl (John Travolta), and he and his race are the worst villains in movie history. Because they're a bunch of idiots and Terl hasn't even checked the Pyschlo library to know what humans eat. Anyways, It is up to Pepper and his group of peoples to make the Psychlo race to an end and destroyed the Pyschlo planet (spoilers).I had HUGE problems with the script, story and plot. First being that there is so many goddamn plot-holes that are bigger than my old jeans. Like I mentioned, the Psychlos are idiots (because how come they can ruled the Earth yet know nothing about us other than that we eat rats?) and the humans aren't even better either. They're obviously monkeys that are trying to be the heroes and being the smartest ones, when reality they don't know how the whole Pyschlo race works and they always make sounds (no wonder why Travolta called them man-animals). Of course they are the obvious ones like it is really stupid to think that there's still electricity for 1,000 years despite the fact that the whole human race is screwed, but I want to go to another topic so that way I won't feel so mad about myself.The acting. Only one good thing about this whole entire movie and that's Forrest Whittaker, that's it. Everyone else looks like they don't want to be in this doomed project. Travolta's voice sounds like a overreacting girl by yelling at the co-stars and his delivery in this movie is worse. Pepper's performance is not interesting. Let's go to technical right now.The technical. There is no good things about the technical stuff either, and it's funny when you think that this movie cost like $73 million to make. The effects look cheap and unfinished. The direction is horrendous (why so many Dutch angles?), and everything else is terrible, especially the score as well.Overall If I find something worse than this (other than Disaster Movie), I will shoot my brains out. Don't watch this movie, it's not the 'so bad it's entertaining' type of movie and it'll never be. I mean like this movie is like what..14 years old, and it's still remembered for the wrong reasons and I'm glad for that. I'm gonna watch something good tomorrow.
