[{"date":"18 May 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Matrix is a film in which it is quite hard to distinguish the frontier between reality and fantasy and in my opinion, the more you see it the more confused you feel. On the one hand I think that it represents a reliable criticism against a world where everything tends to be about the machines and human beings seem to be controlled by them. However, on the other hand, I have the feeling it is a simple ode to existentialism sprinkled with messianic thoughts (Neo appears like the One who can save the mankind) and where special effects and incredible fights are even more important than the script. I am sorry for all the people who think this film is a masterpiece but I have not choice but telling them that it is not enough for a good film to be very pleasing to the eye, it also needs to have a sound and clear script (I am not sure if I have understood very well the film). I hope you can forgive me anyway.
