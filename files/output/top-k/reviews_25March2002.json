It tells us that all American involvement in foreign affairs is good and honest, and that being a soldier equals being a hero.

Some of the scenes looked a little silly due to the computer effects.

Being a movie made from a comic book, that might sound odd, but they were just too over-the-top.  But, like I said for the most part, it was a pretty decent movie.  I liked all the characters, and in some cases I was sad to see them die so soon because I thought there was potential for a kick-ass fight with him\/her, but that didn't pan out.Compared to the first Blade, I thought it was probably just as good.  I liked the story in Blade II a lot actually, it was pretty interesting, and I loved that Blade and the Vampires were forced to team-up to take on these new breed of vampires called Reapers.  Very ironic!  Anyhow, the action is great, the story is great, the characters are great.  If you've seen the original Blade and liked it, then you'll probably like this one as well.

It is the most subtle exploration of the nature of reality sanity vs. insanity, dreams vs. illusion, perception vs. truth.This is achieved through skillful and nuanced acting (particularly by Noriega, Martinez, and Nimri, but Cruz is wonderful as always) and EXTREMELY insightful direction.  The editing (something I almost NEVER notice in a film) is brilliant.I have seen several reviewers complaining that the ending felt spoon-fed. These people missed the point entirely that you cannot accept anything you see as truth- what you are seeing is being filtered through the narrator's perception.  (And what makes you so sure you can trust your own senses, anyway?)  Whether or not you accept what's on the spoon is your choice.A lot of people also seem very quick to recommend this film over Vanilla Sky (or vice-versa).  I saw Abre Los Ojos first and liked it better; I thought the acting and plot were more subtle, and that the additions and pacing changes in Vanilla Sky did dumb it down slightly.  However, this is a film that you need to think about and question as it is in progress, and for most Americans, there just isn't time to do that in Abre los Ojos.  (I am NOT insulting my fellow Americans when I say this; I'm just pointing out that we are not used to having to follow so quickly, because American movies don't tend to require it.) The slower pacing of the ending of Vanilla Sky is better suited to some of us.  I also think that the remake of Vanilla Sky also made it more accessible to many Americans in two ways  first, it's easy to miss the subtleties of the acting when you're busy reading subtitles; second, visual images that are familiar to the audience (i.e., New York vs. Madrid) are more effective.I don't mean to discount Vanilla Sky.  It is also an excellent film.  With the exception of a few additions, it is very faithful to the original. The casting is superb (I didn't like Cameron Diaz's Julia, but I blame that on changes in the script, not the actress; when you have more to say, you don't have to bring it all across in your face).If you don't like this film, think about it for a few days, talk it over with your friends, and then watch it again.  Then do the same for Vanilla Sky.  There is a great wealth of things to think about in both movies separately, or comparing them to each other.If you don't like to think about what you're watching, don't bother seeing either of these films.  There is nothing wrong with this.  But don't give a brilliant film a bad review just because you didn't want to take the time to explore it.

I also think that the remake of Vanilla Sky also made it more accessible to many Americans in two ways  first, it's easy to miss the subtleties of the acting when you're busy reading subtitles; second, visual images that are familiar to the audience (i.e., New York vs. Madrid) are more effective.I don't mean to discount Vanilla Sky.  It is also an excellent film.  With the exception of a few additions, it is very faithful to the original. The casting is superb (I didn't like Cameron Diaz's Julia, but I blame that on changes in the script, not the actress; when you have more to say, you don't have to bring it all across in your face).If you don't like this film, think about it for a few days, talk it over with your friends, and then watch it again.  Then do the same for Vanilla Sky.  There is a great wealth of things to think about in both movies separately, or comparing them to each other.If you don't like to think about what you're watching, don't bother seeing either of these films.

It is the most subtle exploration of the nature of reality sanity vs. insanity, dreams vs. illusion, perception vs. truth.This is achieved through skillful and nuanced acting (particularly by Noriega, Martinez, and Nimri, but Cruz is wonderful as always) and EXTREMELY insightful direction.  The editing (something I almost NEVER notice in a film) is brilliant.I have seen several reviewers complaining that the ending felt spoon-fed. These people missed the point entirely that you cannot accept anything you see as truth- what you are seeing is being filtered through the narrator's perception.  (And what makes you so sure you can trust your own senses, anyway?)  Whether or not you accept what's on the spoon is your choice.A lot of people also seem very quick to recommend this film over Vanilla Sky (or vice-versa).  I saw Abre Los Ojos first and liked it better; I thought the acting and plot were more subtle, and that the additions and pacing changes in Vanilla Sky did dumb it down slightly.  However, this is a film that you need to think about and question as it is in progress, and for most Americans, there just isn't time to do that in Abre los Ojos.

More importantly, Phil is able to heal, able to remake himself into something new and better, precisely the way that Leonard cannot.Despite a few minor snags in the storyline (and Leonard's awareness of his own condition is not one of them), this is a very well-crafted tale that repays repeated viewings and reflection.9\/10  ","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"25 March 2002","score":"","review":"  This is a war movie,but unlike others it dont show the world war 2,instead it shows the tragic event that took place in Somalia in the 90s.This movie is very strong and shows war in a realistic way.It show that the victims are often sivilians and that soldiers are often afraid too.The thing that surprised me most about this movie,is all the gun firing and action.There are constant combat for two hours.I were expecting a slow type of war movie,but this turned out to be one of the most explosive and best war movies that I have seen.Don't get me wrong,war movies are very though and not to be joked with.They are in fact based on true tragic events.This movie also contain a little humor,represented by one soldier,who act a little goofy because he is def.Other than that this is a realistic and strong movie,that will make many of you think of war in an other way.I consider this to be one of the best war movies I have seen,and by far the one with most action,but what can you expect when you have Ridley Scott as director and Jerry Bruckheimer as producer.

The director tried his hand at a slow, emphatic direction style. He failed magnificently. To his credit, many viewers, including an appalling majority of the press, seem to have mistaken good intentions for the accomplished result. Thus the ensuing hype, which is totally unjustified.The film falls short in every domain. It is tedious, unexpressive and maladroit. The story itself is clichematic, and all through the film I kept fighting the urge to follow the better half of the visitors that had already walked out. Again and again you ask yourself why this story was ever made into a motion picture. The material isn't even enough for a television adaptation, because there is no slant, no special interest in the story. This was just an excerpt from a reality tv program, period.The direction tries to turn this little splinter of a story into a film by adding long, quasi-significant pauses instead of offering insight into the characters and their motives. This makes the viewer focus on the actors and their individual skills at positioning a character (with zip to go on). Admittedly, Sissy Spacek does a great job, but she only succeeds in proving she is an actress capable of keeping the attention of the audience. Her character remains a 2-d cardboard cliché. As for the other actors... What can I say? Tom Wilkinson is solid but arthritic, Marisa Tomei is completely out of depth on drama. Nick Stahl follows the directors example and fumbles along. Finally, what really turned this film into a trying experience was the editing. It was simply horrendous, with cuts that were both blunt and meaningless. You are trying to understand why it is you have to watch two old people drinking coffee (e.g.) when suddenly you get a totally different scene thrown in your face. The film is screaming and has nothing to say. There is no clear message, no coherence between scenes.Anyway, the film didn't win an Oscar, which is no surprise. Go see it if you want a manual of how not to make a nice film. Then again, you might check out A Simple Plan for an example of how a small bit of news can be turned into a good film.

Cinematography, music and effects are superb, especially when we consider the fact this movie is not made in Hollywood and the budget is rather limited in comparison with Pearl Harbor and other such films. Then acting, Ondrej Vetchy certainly did well on his part, as well as Tara Fitzgerald as female lead. Others were not so convincing, but I do not see anyone who acted really badly in the movie. Overall mood and style of the movie are excellent as well and even though many people thought the movie was far too sentimental I do not jump on this bandwagon. I am generally not against sentimentality and high emotions unless they are completely unnecessary, which is, I am sorry to say, the case of most American flicks nowadays. In this movie I think it fit pretty well into the story and after all it was believable with some (though major) exceptions about which I will talk later on.Then the bad - the story. I do not have degree in history but I do not think that everything in the movie was fine from historical point of view, but major points were probably OK. Germans really seized all Czech aircrafts in 1939 and many pilots really went to England and also took active part in famous Battle of England. But there is one thing I have major objection to and that is the ending. I think the ending (Karel kills himself to save Frantisek's life) is totally unnecessary and destroys the adequacy of the whole story. There are some aspects of the Susan's character that could be objectionable too, but all of them are rather minor. On the other hand I liked flashes to the prison, which show pretty well what communists that took power in 1948 did to pilots and other heroes that fought against nazi Germany and their only crime was that they did so on Western and not Soviet side. I especially liked the character of German doctor which shows nothing in the world is only black or white. So there are two most remarkable points on this movieFirst, it shows us that emotions are high and deep especially in times of war. Sex never prevails over friendship even though it may seem so in a short run. Second, it brings the story of Czech war pilots to Western audience and it does it very well, without major historical mishaps. It also points out what happen to some of them after communists came into power in late 40's, which is something all Czechs should be ashamed of.Final word - 8 but it is a solid one!
