Some have called this cheesy, but I doubt that anyone would be saying that if 'Titanic' hadn't beaten SPR to it. It's effective, and sets you up for a plot twist at the end (If you still don't get it, that's too bad). The characters are fleshed out stereotypes because they are *representative* characters, and in a plot that's largely a cog in the whole symbolism of the thing. The battle of Omaha beach is not relevant for the plot, but this is a movie which steps outside its plot. It's a morality tale, not about soldiers, but about the modern world where some people are safe because others have died (horribly) bringing that about. This is what the seemingly confusing flashback is about, this is what the battle scenes are about and the whole point of the screenplay seems to be to get us to ask ourselves the question that the old man asks at the end of the movie. It's a shame that nit-picking amateur film critics fail to see the big picture.As for the whole goriness thing... that's the way it is. Gory. You are supposed to be horrified, not entertained (someone described the landing sequence as 'exciting'. I don't know what's more frightening, the sequence or that response). And finally we have a film that pulls no punches and has so much moral ambiguity that we can identify with the characters, loathe them, and find no fault in them all at the same time. I would say 'brilliant', except that it's a function of the sheer horrific nature of the circumstances they find themselves in and not something you feel like applauding.All in all, this is a movie that should, at the very least, change the way that the viewer thinks about action movies.

Speaking of which, I have never seen a movie where the bodies have been shown being killed, one or two days after they're dead, and then not shown ever again.  Stupid.  This is a movie for people who have a black sense of humor, and those who have an IQ lower than their shoe size.  If you see this stink-bomb expect to laugh at the stupidity of the scared people, and the characters.I have never seen so many recycled scenes in one movie.  They reused the washer for scare effect, and they recycled Hewitt's Come and get me scene, and I felt I was cheated out of a couple of original minutes.  This movie was funnier than most of the other comedies this year, including Dr. Dolittle, which I felt is for the same crowd, stupid people. I was rolling on the floor with this movie, especially the tanning bed scene.  Turn it off moron!  I cheered for the deaths, and I felt cheated at the end.  If he really did kill them, I was cheated out of the deaths that I really wanted to see.  Such bad acting should be saved for low-budget flicks, but this may become a high-budget cult flick.  I did not believe that anybody in the movie was scared, and I thought that it was all fun and games to these people, except for her fiancee.  The first movie's only saving grace was laughing at the scared morons, but for this movie I was able to laugh at the situations and the people.  This was a funny movie, and I was laughing so hard I cried.  As a comedy, 8 out of 10, as a horror flick, 1 out of ten.
