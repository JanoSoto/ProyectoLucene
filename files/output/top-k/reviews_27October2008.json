That's probably because i was then still enough naive to believe there could be something as thrilling as the original films that coloured part of my childhood dreams. Also because the gap between the old ones and this i was seeing was so huge that the disappointment wouldn't allow me to put this in its place.About Star Wars it's impossible for me to look at the old films as coldly as i would look at a film without that charge of nostalgia. Thinking about it, i think this is a complement to the old series. Looking back, seeing this and thinking about the old features, i think George Lucas is not a good director, he is quite ordinary and he understood that when he chose not to direct episodes 5 and 6. He doesn't have any special angle, he does everything like anyone else would do; he watched the masters but couldn't extract what they were really aiming that. But he is a great storyteller, and was absolutely masterful in the way he created this franchising.He created a new cosmology and fed the dry minds of a mythless society with stories that placed superior forces (Force) beyond the control of ordinary beings, something that 'surrounds' them (here he killed the mystique with the useless midclorian explanation). The way audiences evolved to appreciate such stories based on supernatural and the idea of finding forces and events that exceed us proved Lucas right, and at the same time underline the role the original Star Wars had in molding pop thinking for the last 30 years. Indiana Jones, Lord of the Rings (refished for cinema), Harry Potter, and a number of equivalent series. People have a tendency to look for religion, and wanting to rely on it. That's what positive 'cause effect' thinking wouldn't consider, and the extreme marxist societies would help hide. To me that's the key to the success of all this.A decade ago Lucas felt it was the time to come back. He had a lot of story blanks to fill, a lot of promises from the old movies, a whole galaxy of untold events. That's rich, he created the universe, and he wanted to explore it. But the problem is, he wasn't competent to do that. Here he doesn't have the angle and the innovation quality he ha in 1977, when his effects were breathtaking, they would still amaze me when i first saw the films, in the late 80'. Here the special effects are just of medium quality in the middle of what's been done lately (to which his exploration post Star Wars contributed a lot). So, because we don't have that innovative side, and the story is already known (who knows the old films knows what to expect from this one), the magic is partially gone, and the flaws of Lucas-director show up, vivid as never. Of course there are the hard-core fans who won't abandon the boat and will blindly vote negative on this comment because it 'insults' their beliefs, but even those penalized these new films (6.4 rating in IMDb as i write).It's a beautiful story, that of Star Wars, but Lucas, either burnt out and with no new approaches to use, or influenced by money fetchers around him (or both previous), messed up with this. It's as if Lucas had become Anakin he was a curious intelligent brilliant little boy, protected by the Force and who was supposed to bring peace and prosperity to the Republic, but in the end turned to the dark side.My opinion 3\/5 http\/\/www.7eyes.wordpress.com ","genre":null},{"date":"27 October 2008","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" I must say i was much more satisfied with this now than when i first saw it, at the time of its release.

When I first saw this film in the theater I was taken back by how flawlessly, the Director expressed the story of the title character Forrest Gump. I am surprised however, by all the Forrest Gump haters out there, who view this as some sort of propaganda machine, or film about a man who skates his way through life and achieves everything. Boo hoo, are those haters jealous because he did everything right or because he made a gazillion dollars? Well, life is different for everybody. Maybe somehow, these people don't believe that something like this is possible? How could a simple, southern man from Greenbow, Alabama succeed when all he does is follow the direction of others? This films theme after all, (SPOILERS), is whether life is governed by destiny or, by chance? I won't get into a debate about that here but, lets remember this is fictional, and it's for entertainment. Don't take it so seriously...enjoy it! The acting by Tom Hanks is beautiful. It is hard to view Tom Hanks, now, as anything other than Forrest. His character was completely submersed in this role. The accent was spot on, and the journey through the south, (Alabama, Savannah Ga., etc), was remarkable. Forrest is portaied as immediately different from the supporting cast. He goes through the same course of life as everyone around him but, he achieves his milestones in a unique way that only makes sense, but possibly not, to Forrest. The title character always brings his definition of life back to what he was taught by his Mamma. I think this is a very real, and touching way of showing respect to all the mother's out there who are constantly defining for their children what the world is about. The life of Forrest is logical only to him. He doesn't question the advice given by his mother as being wrong, and he stops at that. No further thought is involved, he takes the advice and uses it as he floats his way through life. Every scene in this film is used to convey how destiny and chance usually occur at the same time.All in all I give this film two thumbs, way up.

The action takes place in Madrid rather than New York. The central character, Cesar, is a wealthy young man-about-town, a practised and successful womaniser. At the beginning of the film he is pursuing is the lovely Sofia, even though she is the girlfriend of his best friend Pelayo. His pursuit of Sofia, however, has aroused the jealousy of his own jilted girlfriend, Nuria, who attempts to take bloody revenge. She offers Cesar a lift in her car, then tries to kill both him and herself by deliberately crashing it. Nuria dies; Cesar survives, but his once-handsome face is hideously disfigured.In the immediate aftermath of the crash, Cesar suffers from depression, but then his life starts to improve. His face is rebuilt (something his doctors had previously told him was impossible) thanks to new surgical techniques. Sofia tells him that she is in love with him, and the two become lovers. And then, inexplicably, his fortunes take a turn for the worse again. He begins to suffer from hallucinations; believing that Sofia is really Nuria, returned from the dead, he strangles her while the two are making love. He is arrested but because of his mental state is not put on trial; instead a psychiatrist interviews him, trying to discover the reason for his crime.The above synopsis sets out events in their logical order, but this is not, in fact, the order in which the film narrates them. Director Alejandro Amenabar uses a non-linear narration technique, making extensive use of flashbacks, in which events are not narrated in the sequence in which they occurred. This makes the film, for much of its length, something of a puzzle; it is not until towards the end that we can work out exactly what has been going on, and even then some points are unclear. The possibility is left open that some, or all, of what we have seen may be Cesar's dream rather than reality, even that he is trapped in a nightmare of his own making. (This is a similar idea to that expressed in one of the most famous works of Spanish literature, Pedro Calderon de la Barca's La Vida es Sueno, or Life is a Dream).I have only seen one of Amenabar's other film, the English-language The Others from 2001. Like The Others, Abre los Ojos ends with a sudden, shocking twist. The twist in the tale is a device which has been worked to death in recent years, particularly by the writers and directors of crime stories, but there are still some directors who are capable of using it effectively. M. Night Shyamalan is one, and Amenabar another. I don't want to give away the full details of the denouement of Abre los Ojos, but I can say that it has a very strange ending which, unexpectedly, takes us into the realms of science fiction.I never liked Vanilla Sky which always struck me as an overblown Tom Cruise vanity project, probably made to help his then girlfriend Penelope Cruz break through into Hollywood films. (The lovely Penelope plays the equivalent character, also called Sofia, in the later film). Abre los Ojos, however, is much better, for a number of reasons. The plot may be something of a puzzle, but at least it is a puzzle with a solution; with Vanilla Sky it was much more difficult to work out what was going on. Like a number of other Continental actors, Penelope Cruz is better when acting in her own language than when acting in English. Eduardo Noriega was better than Tom Cruise, partly because the role of Cesar (David in the remake) is more suited to a young man in his early twenties than to a man approaching middle age. (Cruise was 39 when he made Vanilla Sky). Noriega's Cesar, at least before the accident, has all the arrogant self-confidence of youth, something which may have a certain appeal in the very young but which becomes much less appealing when seen in an older man.Like many Hollywood attempts to copy European films, Vanilla Sky loses a good deal in translation. That fact, however, should not blind us to the good qualities of the original, a strange, haunting and sometimes poetic film. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 October 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This is the Spanish original version of the film that was later remade with Tom Cruise as Vanilla Sky.

Then as we move on story starts to unfold before us and we are for a shock, especially last ten minutes, which for me, was one of the most powerful and harsh realization of history on cinema ever. It completely took me off guard after watching movie till that point, although there was this element that something is gonna happen, but I by no means expected this. As a viewer, I was lost for most part with so much peace around and little interference of the government in the movie that I forget not just what period it is set in, but the place too, as we are use to seeing the kind of Russian life during revolution and war times which is nothing but tragic. I guess movie did it part in not just portraying troubled soviet history but very convincingly showed us that even though people might have done bad deeds but during those period it was safe that way for them and their family. For them it was all about survival,living was secondary, but I can only guess as in current time I don't have to worry about survival but I worry about living. I sincerely salute every soul who lived through that sad period of history.Acting wise all actors were good but I must admit the little Nadya was amazing as the daughter of Nikita Mikhalkov colonel's daughter (she is his real life daughter) and she impresses us with her innocence, cuteness and boldness at times with elders (not rudeness, its just innocence of a child) throughout the movie. The scenes between Nadya and her father are one of the best aspects of the movie. Direction is top class. Music suits to the mood of the movie. Highly Recommended!!

Lon Chaney Jr. had made a good showing in The Wolf Man which seemed to have just a bit of that magic, but much of that was squandered by his appearance in this film.

Thinking for some reason that the monster would know the location of Dr. Frankenstein's book of secrets, he revives the monster (played with much facial contortion by Bela Lugosi).I liked Lugosi as the monster, actually, but I would have dug on more actual monster battles like what we see in the sequel, House of Frankenstein. Lugosi's interpretation of the monster is by far the least sympathetic and in terms of the writing the least substantial. He has again become mute, for example.

Sam Neil, who would go on to star in an even scarier film EVENT HORIZON, three years later, here plays a buttoned-down, by-the-numbers insurance investigator hot on the trail of a missing author. His search takes him into a town wholly created by the missing author, a place where all sorts of terrible things lie in wait. The author himself is hidden away in the town, but to say more would be to give away too much. While the author is supposedly a Stephen King type, the movie itself and the horrors that await the investigator are right out of H.P. Lovecraft, being far more psychological than visceral. I have said from the day I first saw this film that it is a study in madness more than it is a straight horror film. We start out with Neil in a straitjacket, being locked away in a padded cell. The rest of the movie is told in flashback, as the fastidious insurance man slowly comes apart at the seams. The final shot of this now-completely mad man laughing hysterically is extremely unsettling.

Akira Kurosawa's epic tale concerns honor and duty during a time when the old traditional order is breaking down. The film opens with master samurai Kambei posing as a monk to save a kidnapped farmer's child. Impressed by his selflessness and bravery, a group of farmers begs him to defend their terrorised village from bandits. Kambei agrees, although there is no material gain or honor to be had in the endeavour. Soon he attracts a pair of followers a young samurai named Katsushiro who quickly becomes Kambei's disciple, and boisterous Kikuchiyo , who poses as a samurai but is later revealed to be the son of a farmer. Kambei assembles four other samurais, including Kyuzo , a master swordsman, to round out the group. Together they consolidate the village's defences and shape the villagers into a militia, while the bandits loom menacingly nearby. Soon raids and counter-raids build to a final bloody heart-wrenching battle.I'm not a big fan of old black and white movies . I used to watch many as a kid but as i have got older i have found i have not really got the patience for them. Because of that , Seven Samurai was always going to be a difficult film for me to watch. Not because of it's content but because of the length - Three hours and nine minutes! So to stop me drifting i decided i would watch the movie in two parts and because of that decision i really enjoyed this epic movie. You can see many comparisons with the Magnificent seven . The Samurai all have distinctive characters and you can see the comparison to the Yul Brynner and Robert Vaughn roles from the 1960 film but despite the comparison's they are very different movies. Seven Samurai is a far more brutal movie than the Western version but it also has some very poignant moments. None more so than the very last scene where the surviving Samurai are standing at the gravesides of their fallen comrades.The performance from Takashi Shimura ( Kambei the samurai leader ) and Toshiro Mifune ( the crazy Samurai) are very memorable and at times i completely forgot i was watching a film that was made 54 years ago.Although film purist's will rate this higher than the John Sturges remake i still prefer the Cowboy v Mexican version but i grew up watching that film so that is to be expected.Seven Samurai is definitely going to be one of those films that will be embedded on my brain for the rest of my life and the split viewing was well worth it in the end.I will leave you with the thoughts of Kikuchiyo - What do you think of farmers? You think they're saints? Hah! They're foxy beasts! They say, We've got no rice, we've no wheat. We've got nothing! But they have! They have everything! Dig under the floors! Or search the barns! You'll find plenty! Beans, salt, rice, sake! Look in the valleys, they've got hidden warehouses! They pose as saints but are full of lies! If they smell a battle, they hunt the defeated! They're nothing but stingy, greedy, blubbering, foxy, and mean!Nothing changes does it!

Talbot, realizing that if the killing is to stop he must die, seeks out the old gypsy woman Maleva(Maria Ouspenskaya) whose son brought the curse upon him. But, the authorities and his psychiatric doctor, Dr. Mannering(Patric Knowles) are out to find him, hoping to return him to an asylum thinking he's merely a mad murderer needing to be locked away. Instead, Talbot is led to Vasaria where Dr. Frankenstein's castle was located hoping he could help him. Unfortunate for Talbot, the doctor has since died and he finds the monster encased in ice, blind and weak. Talbot desires Frankenstein's diary and appeals to the scientist's ancestor, Baroness Elsa Frankenstein(Ilona Massey)hoping to sell the place ridding herself of an accursed property that has slandered her name, and finds a village of people wishing him to leave. When the monster(..played by a stilted Lugosi, attempting to show it's limitations due to a loss of power and sight)bursts upon frightened villagers, Talbot finds himself in need of help. Mannering promises the village he'd disassemble the monster as his creator had pieced it together. Led by Elsa to the castle, Mannering finds a will to provide the monster with full strength due to a mad curiosity. Finding the diary thanks to Elsa, Talbot hopes to rid himself of the lycanthropic curse, but Mannering has other plans. With a dam underneath the castle, the village might decide to take drastic measures to relieve themselves of Frankenstein's memory forever.I love most of this movie, especially Talbot's struggles to rid himself of the curse that has become an obsession due to his uncontrollable killing spree. Great scene where he attacks a street copper and this perhaps, next to The Wolf Man, Chaney's meatiest role as Talbot. We do get a climactic battle between the werewolf and Frankenstein's monstrous creation, but I was never quite sure of the motivations behind Mannering who seemed very stable and controlled..I wasn't convinced that such a man would purposely give strength to such a humongous and dangerous monster threatening to harm anyone in it's way. It was really neat seeing Maria Ouspenskaya with a stronger role as Maleva, who refers to Talbot as her son bringing a warmth and tender relationship between the two. I'm not sure what happens to her at the end as the castle is reduced to rubble, but it was great seeing her as a more prominent figure trying to help a troubled soul with a burden beyond his control. Massey is a stunner, dressed very well by the costume department, under a sexy accent. Atwill is the mayor of Vasaria, attempting to keep his people from forming into a lynch-mob. Dwight Frye is merely reduced to a villager questioning the mayor of his methods at not interfering with the activities of those in Frankenstein's castle ruins when it's clear experiments are taking place. Thanks to the impeccable work of director Roy William Neill, who was a seminal artist behind the beloved Holmes\/Watson films, develops an incredible atmosphere and his noirish stylistic imprint displays what he could do with Universal's studio backing. I think this is essential viewing to all Wolf Man fans despite it's story flaws. Kind of episodic as Talbot seeks a cure, meeting various situations to the conclusion in the Frankenstein castle. You get to see the Wolf Man move around more than later on, especially at the end when the beast continually charges the enormous monster. I won't ridicule Lugosi considering the infamous history of production problems which would explain certain facets of the monster not explained on screen. I will say that this must've been an embarrassment to him considering how Karloff made the monster such an indelible iconic figure, and his performance turns out so laughable due to cuts and edits.

After his release, he's convinced himself that he's never going back to his life of crime, but before he knows it, he's inevitably being pulled back thanks to his corrupt friends and family.While Scareface centered around the action and grittiness of the gangster life more then anything else, Carlito's Way tends to lean to the romantic side, giving the film an artsy twist. For example, in one scene there is a close up shot of a revolver, the chamber slowly moving to an empty slot. There is another famous scene with Carlito inside of a dark bathroom, his back against a wall with a pistol in hand. The way the camera is placed, the way Carlito is standing, and the way the lighting reflects off of the wall and his leather jacket are all taken in to account by De Palma. To make a long story short, Carlito's Way is very beautiful, and this is all thanks to De Palma. He directs the movie very well, you can tell that he put some true dedication in to this film.Needless to say, the acting is incredible, no matter what you might be hearing. Al Pacino is as always great, and Penelope Ann Miller is as well. But most of the time you'll find yourself deeper inside Sean Penn's character then Pacino's or anyone else's. He's steals nearly every scene he's in, if not then he steals all of them. He's almost too convincing.The scores are very, very strong and add on to the artistic feel to the movie. Not only do they add on to that, but it adds to the tension, the romance, and the tears as well.To sum it all up, Carlito's Way is the best gangster film ever made.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"27 October 2008","score":"29 out of 31 people found the following review useful","review":" Al Pacino, Sean Penn, and Penelope Ann Miller create an artistic and romantic twist to the gangster genre in Carlito's way, story of a convicted gangster by the name of Carlito Brigante, known to his ex-lover as Charlie, who manages to get his way out of jail thanks to crooked drug-addicted lawyer David Kleinfield. After his release, he's convinced himself that he's never going back to his life of crime, but before he knows it, he's inevitably being pulled back thanks to his corrupt friends and family.While Scareface centered around the action and grittiness of the gangster life more then anything else, Carlito's Way tends to lean to the romantic side, giving the film an artsy twist. For example, in one scene there is a close up shot of a revolver, the chamber slowly moving to an empty slot. There is another famous scene with Carlito inside of a dark bathroom, his back against a wall with a pistol in hand. The way the camera is placed, the way Carlito is standing, and the way the lighting reflects off of the wall and his leather jacket are all taken in to account by De Palma. To make a long story short, Carlito's Way is very beautiful, and this is all thanks to De Palma. He directs the movie very well, you can tell that he put some true dedication in to this film.Needless to say, the acting is incredible, no matter what you might be hearing.

Interestingly, the lecturer who was so hot on this movie was a Pagan herself. Why she was so happy, then, to talk-up a movie that basically bludgeons Wiccans to within an inch of their lives remains to be seen. Perhaps the whole walking-boot wearing, vegan, home-made wine Paganism she followed was up for a rather bitter laugh at itself, but I'm not totally sure. She left the department soon after this and perhaps the fact that she recommended this mediocre movie to 200 students has something to do with it. The Craft, in a nutshell, is about a group of 4 misfits who use their growing magical powers for their own selfish ends. Predictably, one of them goes bonkers, one has an attack of conscience, and 2 are pathetic sheep who, of course, choose to follow Ms Nutter around committing increasingly unpleasant acts. The message of this film is confused from the outset. Despite apparently consulting a world-wide Paganism group to make sure the rituals and beliefs portrayed were 'accurate' I cannot help thinking that this film gives Wicca a good drubbing, whether it meant to or not. Ironically, near the beginning of the film, you see a wild-eyed fundamentalist Christian preaching on the wrong side of town. His compatriots appear to be hobos wielding snakes, but don't worry, because the super-cool and liberal Pagans soon appear to have very few redeeming features themselves. They are for the most part portrayed as vindictive lunatics who use their powers for reasons trivial, selfish or murderous. Changing your hair and eye colour, levitating your friends and throwing jocks out of the window is deur rigeur in teen Wiccan circles according to this. If you deviate, three astigmatic chicks crash through your window and attempt to kill you. Is this really how Pagans want to be portrayed? The film even includes the line, We are the weirdos, Mister! as the gals strut off to perform a ritual in the woods. Even the 'good witch' comes across as an unpleasant character towards the end, as she threatens 2 of her friends (a branch breaks off a tree in a crack of lightening in a shot that looks alarmingly like stock footage) and apparently relishes the fact that the 'bad witch' has ended up in an insane asylum. In addition to leaving a nasty taste in the mouth, the film has also dated horribly. Though 'Clueless' was 90s through and through, its excellent writing keeps it fresh.

Another thing that erked me was, of course, the witches had to be goths, which reasserts the idea that Wiccans are all tortured teens going through a phase. Though the acting is good and the plot reasonable, The Craft remains an over-blown supernatural drama that sets out to entertain one type of person and one type of person only.

The fairly heavy British accent throws me badly as well, so it was lucky that captioning was provided, but having to read the dialog rather than listening to it makes it harder for me to get emotionally involved in the story.The many glowing comments I've read on this site are, I think, very well deserved, but because of the difficulties mentioned above born of being a Middle-America Yankee made it hard to really enjoy the film. had it been filmed in the US, by an American director, I'd probably be giving the film a 9 or 10. My 6 reflects my overall enjoyment, though the actual movie quality is decidedly higher.

Taus-Melek and Melek-Tawus, Peacock Angel - a Yezidic angel whose name is another word for the devil of Buddhism. When invoked during conjuring rituals he manifests as a peacock. He is also said to be an angel or demiurge who created Eve from the body of Adam in Forlong's Encyclopedia of Religions. According to the Kurdish Moslem sect of Yezidics in the Upper Mesopotamia (Iraq), Taus-Melek is a fallen archangel, now pardoned, to whom God has committed the government of the world and the management of the transmigration of souls. Melek Tawus is an angel who has fallen from God's grace, and for his repentance, is restored to God's favor. While in hell, Melek Tawus, in seven thousand years filled seven jars with his tears of repentance which extinguished the fires of hell, or at the last judgment will be used to do so. Melek Tawus was banished from the sight of God because he refused to bow down, as asked, before God's creation, Adam. But Yezidis do not identify the fallen angel with a spirit of evil. The act of disobedience has been forgiven by god as a father forgives a wayward son. During the climax of Dario Argento's Suspiria Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper) is waiting for the awakening of Mater Suspiriorum (The Mother of Sights) from her ghastly slumber. She is standing near the figure of Melek Tawus, black Peacock Angel, Satan himself. Suspiria is so masterful in its submission of colors and so full of symbolism that its praising is a blasphemy. The fallic knife penetrating beating heart lingers fresh in my memory. It haunts me like the red blood dripping walls of Freiburg academy. An absolute opus magnum of Italian horror.

The script is forwarded by a series of non-sequiturs and jumps in logic, the plot is generic and by the numbers and the direction is get-the-job-done. Fast and tight but largely unimaginative. DW3 however stands and falls with the iconic character of Paul Kersey and the badassitude he's capable of inflicting on no-good punks. Charlie Bronson for the most part sleepwalks his way through it but give him a magnum hand-cannon and he's as good a badass as there ever was, then and now.One might find the first hour bland but stick with it, for the final thirty minutes are a literal blast. The movie becomes so far removed from reality and so fully embraces the comic-book sensibilies at its heart that everything that transpired up to that point is forgiven and even makes sense as a means of easing the viewer in. See Charlie Bronson coldcocking a colourful assortment of badly dressed thugs by the dozens in broad daylight using a WWII machine-gun and I dare you not to revel in the white-hot, blistering chaos of it all. Squarejohn residents, fed up by the local gang, take up arms along with Bronson and all hell breaks loose.Hoodlums throw grenades through windows, old men are set on fire, ordinary women fire double-barreled shotguns at punks, cops run through the streets shooting at thugs perched on windows and rooftops who fire back using semi-automatics, this is the universe DW3 takes place in. Eighties cheese (complete with eye-of-the-tiger-ish synth score) meets Bosnia Herzegovina. And it's supposed to take place somewhere in East NYC. You know it is an outrageous all-out-war action extravaganza you're watching, when Bronson fires an anti-tank, anti-personnel, armor-piercing rocket launcher inside a living room. Everything leading up to the climax is forgettable but action nuts will get a major kick out of the final thirty minutes. In turns bland, unintentionally funny and outrageous, make of it what you will.
