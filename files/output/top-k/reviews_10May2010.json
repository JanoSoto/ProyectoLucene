Confused and despondent over what has happened to him he grumbles over his sad lot in life until a chance meeting causes him to leap to the defense of a young rocker by the name of Beverly Switzler. Intrigued by Howard she takes him into her life -- and her bed -- and attempts to both acclimate him to life on Earth whilst attempting to help figure out how he came to be here and if it's possible for him to return to his home planet. Through a close friend they do eventually find out how it happened, but before they can attempt to recreate the accident in reverse (yeah that always works) another accident occurs during testing...but this time something far worse and evil has arrived.Considered a MASSIVE misstep by pretty much everyone involved in this project the film was not only a big financial and critical failure, but also the butt of many a joke for quite a while. A classic example of not only too many cooks who don't know what they're doing in the kitchen, but even those at the core of its creation had seemingly no idea of the true nature and spirit of the Howard the Duck comics and hoo brother does it show! Although I suppose to most people it was just a bad movie, but to a long standing comic book fan this was yet another painful representation of a beloved character on the silver screen. Which I suppose sort of makes me have to come clean about something....I am indeed a big comic book nerd and at the time a very big Howard the Duck fan as were many of my friends. Quite routinely this film gets brought up as a very bad movie and although I haven't fully disputed this in the past, I have defended it somewhat as more of a poorly executed mediocre movie with some very nice scenes of Lea Thompson in her underwear as, like many a young man in the '80s, we had quite a crush on the wee lass. So for no particular reason at all I decided to revisit the film and see how much I could still enjoy it.I didn't enjoy it.Yes I do have to admit that the movie is pretty bad and it makes me rather sad looking back wondering what could have been. Obviously when the movie was initially announced my friends and I were pretty happy and pleasantly surprised. Initially we were skeptical but at the time Lucas was coming off of his Star Wars films and still had a good name creatively speaking. He was also revealed to be something of a fan of the Howard comics so we felt that this could be a solid comic book film albeit a slightly odd choice. On hindsight it all makes tons of sense as to why this whole thing was a disaster. I mean, if you told anyone NOW that Lucas was going to make an A picture involving Howard the Duck your reaction would be Nooooooooo! much like Vader did resulting in much unintentional humor.It's funny but kind of sad to watch the writers of Howard the Duck these days talk about the movie looking back as they attempt to defend it by making statements about how people just needed to relax and accept the movie for the silly fun ride that it was supposed to be. It's not an existential movie they would proclaim! It's just a fun movie that was probably a bit ahead of its time. Oy. Let me explain something to the non comic book nerds out there...Howard the Duck was an extremely existential comic book as well as mixing in some rather long bouts of surrealism -- THAT'S why it was funny. The creator Steve Gerber used that template to then poke farcical takes on the ridiculous nature of popular Marvel heroes and villains. But at the core Howard as always just Howard attempting to get by in life no matter what it threw at him and all the while we slowly got to know everything thing about this average duck both inside and out.But obviously they didn't get it -- not the writers, not the studio, not Lucas...nobody. Again, on hindsight it all seems so obvious, but at the time it seemed like it all might work. To be fair there are some good moments. Lea Thompson, besides being quite fetching in little clothing, is quite fitting as Beverly even though she's obviously not exactly the curvaceous model that she was in the comic. But her attitude and quick acceptance of Howard as a person as well as her interaction with him are actually quite charming. Character actor Jeffrey Jones also delivers a quite amusing performance as an alien possessed scientists slowly devolving\/involving into a horrific looking creature. It's kind of funny to note that Vincent D'Onofrio gave a very similar performance as Edgar the Bug in Men in Black.There's also some nice stunt work, excellent puppet work, and some excellent physical performance by Ed Gale who had to do pretty much every scene completely blind as he couldn't see out of the suit. But in the end it's just another bad comic book movie put together by a bunch of people who completely misunderstood the source material. They just thought that it was a silly book about a talking duck and threw a bunch of duck and bird-related puns and jokes in there and that was about it.Really just an awful movie although part of me will always remember it a little fondly due to my love for Howard in general.

I think the main problem on why this wasn't as special as its first three predecessors, was it went a bit too far over the line, and the fact that I had trouble sympathizing with anyone. Sondra Locke's character is often just as despicable as the rapist's by pulling what she is, and the fact that her character is very hard to like, because of her attitude. Most of the time I enjoy revenge movies, I enjoy seeing them get it in the worst ways, but the person that was doing it, I didn't feel that same excitement because I didn't like her character. The finale is pretty exciting stuff, with Harry tracking down the rapist's, it definitely delivers on that part. While I enjoyed this movie, I didn't feel the excitement, the thrills, the suspense or that great gritty feel that I always love to see while watching this series.Performances. Clint Eastwood isn't bad, but he seems unsure on what to do here in this movie. It's not entirely his fault, it's the way they set him up in this one, and at times I didn't feel he was the main focal point. Sandra Locke is very wooden, and I couldn't stand her character. Her chemistry with Eastwood is non-existent as well. Pat Hingle known for his roles in The original Batman movies, is great in his role as a somewhat shady Chief. Bradford Dillman plays his part well as Briggs once again, bigger prick then ever!. Audrie Neenan plays a despicable b*tch to a T, very chilling stuff. Paul Drake is pretty creepy as the main rapist, you will despise him.Bottom line. Not memorable like the 1st three, and a bit too violent for its own good, but it's still an entertaining watch.

Don't expect the quality of the 1st three, and you'll do alright.

The intro of the movie with the music was very good as well as the movement. This is hands down an art film and if you aren't into it don't even bother with it. It's full of random moments and characters, each having significant symbolism and meanings. So if that is not your cup of tea just stay away and go watch something else you will enjoy. Other than that the movie is fairly good. The main character is a director pressured by the world to come up with this new movie, but he hasn't the slightest idea for one. That leads him down a winding trail of lying confusing the people around him with his tirades and crazy schemes. The movie has musical numbers in them, which I for one didn't get nor fully enjoy. They were just flashbacks from his life and his own fantasies. I felt they just killed time and proved the man's obsession with women and his craziness. There was one mistake in the film that I could not get over, it's in the end when he is told he has a gun in his right pocket, but he clearly pulls it out of his left pocket. That ruined the movie for me. I mean it's such a huge detail in the movie to screw up, and they did it royally. That just ruined the whole thing for me. I don't know if they meant to do that on purpose, but they had this whole movie based on nothing but a man with no idea for a movie being pressured for greatness, all to lead to his demise and they screw up the part where he pulls out the weapon. I mean come on have some class and respect for your movie! Mixed reviews on this movie, its good, but I'll probably never see it again.

I mean I sure it was good but it was not in English and it is so hard to keep up with subtitles and keep up with what is going on in the movie. I found my mind just giving up and wondering off through out the entire thing. But I must add that this was definitely not the worst film I have seen in this class. Just to watch it without trying to keep up with the titles I found myself laughing at it quite a bit. I am not sure if it was intended to be funny but the characters I found to be kind of goofy. The one guy that ran around the whole time acting kind of crazy like he was my favorite. His outfit, the loin cloth, Tarzan was very entertaining. I was sad to see him die. But at least he went out good. This movie was also very long. It could have been just a little shorter I think. In this film a town is going attacked by some bully like clan and so the people set out looking for some Samurai to come help them fight them off. They return with seven samurais. There is long fighting and many from both sides die. It was sad when the good guys died. One of the warriors falls in love with the daughter of a man who had made her cut off her hair so she would look like a male, so as to avoid catching the attention of the horny Samurai men. But we could practically predict that it would end up happening in the end anyways. After lots of fighting and battling it all ends and the good guys prevail but not without having suffered many great losses.

They really don't give to much information a way at a time, they sort of drop little pieces on you then it all comes together perfectly I really enjoyed that aspect. The strong acting from Dean really made his character so mysterious and captivating. Cals brother plays the perfect good guy almost the complete opposite then Cal which they make very obvious when they always show Cal messing with people, perfect example was when they were at the parade. The movie also has you question your own values do you think it was right Cal ended up winning over his father and Aron is pretty much just forgot about? Did Cal do the right thing by bringing his brother to see there mother? Being very close to the end of the Hayes code this movie came very close to crossing the line its pretty obvious there mom is running some type of illegal house most likely involving prostitutes yet they never come out and say it. The whole part who Cal stole Arons girl and how his mom left there family at the time would be very unheard of and consider socially wrong. This movie also bring ups question tons about war is it right, should you profit off it, who should get drafted... The cinematography was excellent, the effect when Cal was on swing talking to his dad and the camera looked like it was on some sort of swing as well very unique never had seen it before and really enjoyed it.

Such violence had never been shown before in fact caused a great deal of terror within audiences and although film has certainly progressed in terms of the allowance of sexuality and violence this film is yet to seem outdated. In fact, any of the scenes the involve Norman Bates still terrify me. Hitchcock allows the interactions between Marion Crane and Norman Bates to unfold slowly and switches the camera's point of view back and forth between Norman's when he is observing Marion and the omniscient allowing the audience to watch Marion go about her business in the motel room this adds to the suspense during the entire beginning of the film. Anthony Perkins is outstanding in his role as Norman Bates and his mother of course. He plays his role so well that the audience fears and feels for him. He allows the audience to see the struggle between his wants and the control his mother still has over him. There is nothing bad I can say about this film it is fabulous in every aspect.

We are told, in one way or another, who the villain is, very early on. The focus shifts to something profoundly personal. Colin Firth gives life to a character I have never seen on the screen before. Some people may think it is extreme, so gloomy, so strange, but, absolutely spot on. Financial worries force him to open up to another human being. He needs a tenant to survive the escalating living expenses. His revival movie theatre is not paying off - videos are killing me - he complains to his future tenant. Let's remember this is 1988 in Argentina. Nothing of what matters to Adrianm ( Firth) matters to anybody else. The loneliness of that, I've seen reflected on the face of an actor for the first time and, to my horror, I recognize it immediately. To find a twin soul when you're so different is nearly impossible and I have the feeling that Colin found that for himself a long time ago and accepted his loneliness as a matter of fact. Colin Firth is astonishing! As I'm writing about this, the urge to see it again is taking over my senses. The tenderness of his need is so shattering because it would be easy, very easy to making him happy and I suspect, his tenant ( a fantastic Hart Bochner) realizes that 5 seconds after he meets him.

To find a twin soul when you're so different is nearly impossible and I have the feeling that Colin found that for himself a long time ago and accepted his loneliness as a matter of fact. Colin Firth is astonishing! As I'm writing about this, the urge to see it again is taking over my senses. The tenderness of his need is so shattering because it would be easy, very easy to making him happy and I suspect, his tenant ( a fantastic Hart Bochner) realizes that 5 seconds after he meets him. I consider myself a film buff, I've loved film since I was a child, so, how is it possible I never heard of this movie before? I've been reading that the director, an odd ball himself, is quite an extraordinary man and I intend to listen to his DVD commentary. I've ordered my own copy this morning. I'll be waiting for it and that is another first for me.

Like the love child of Frank Capra, Preston Sturges, Charlie Chaplin and a MTV mix-tape, Hughes created a world of angsty teens, downtrodden losers, catchy pop tunes and shamelessly sentimental button pushing. At his best, he gave us films like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club and Planes Trains and Automobiles, at his worst, hokey crap like Curley Sue and Uncle Buck. By time he quit film-making in the early 90s, Hughes was already an intolerable parody of himself, knocking off his own formulas and reheating his own plots. Between 1991 and 2008 he seemed to have completely sold out, writing a string of horrendous films which, in his defence, may have turned out better had he directed them himself.Planes, Trains and Automobiles features a simple plot a company executive (Steve Martin) and a travelling salesman (John Candy) attempt to cross the country and get back to their families in time for Thanksgiving. The catch here is that Candy is an accident prone idiot who, at the end of the film, reveals himself to be homeless, alienated and without a family. In this one stroke, Hughes indicts both Martin and we the audience for being self-obsessed jerks. The message be thankful, empathetic and don't let your own unhappiness blind you to the sorrow of others. Hughes' films may be paper thin, but he has a knack for sneaking in some pretty emotional and painfully naked moments. Think that long sequence in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, in which a kid called Cameron confesses his hatred of his father, then lashes out against him by destroying the old man's car. At once intense and real, the scene seems to come out of nowhere, revealing the tragedy behind a, up until that point, lightweight pop film.Ditto the emotional meltdowns at the end of Breakfast Club, in which a group of teens stick knifes in one another's chests, or the ending of Planes Trains and Automobiles, when we're forced to re-evaluate John Candy's character, previously an object of humour and annoyance. With Hughes the message is always this is fun, until you look a bit closer. Perhaps the best example of this is Home Alone (which Hughes wrote but didn't direct), in which every kid's fantasy (being the lord of the manor) turns into a complete nightmare, a little boy realising, not only how hard it is to defend a home, but how important a family is and how lonely Christmas is without one.There's also something very modern and functional about Hughes visual style in Ferris, Breakfast and Planes. It's all simple static shots, stark compositions, lots of whites and brightly lit locations. Couple this with some nice synth music and you have a pretty cool aesthetic.8\/10 &#x96; Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club and Planes, Trains and Automobiles are Hughes' best films, though the later is quite a few notches below the other two. The comedy is forced at times, the sentimentality cloying and the shock ending should have been set up and milked better. Mostly, though, Planes lacks the originality of the other two films, Hughes recycling elements of Jack Lemmon's The Out of Towners and The Odd Couple.Worth two viewings.

Can't keep up with a movie if you can read what is going down in the subtitles. Over all this was a very charming movie. Makes you feel good in how she found someone who loved her and would always be there. This is one of those films that gives the hopeless romantics hope. I would recommend this film to others especially over a bunch of the other ones I have had to sit and watch in this class but I definitely wouldn't be like you have to see this film it is that good. More of if you are going to have to watch these kinds of films this is one that you will not completely suffer through.

There was no sound or music at all. I am spoiled by the horror films today. This film was very slow and symbolic of World War Two. I was expecting a really cool kind of Dracula film and was disappointed. It was Dracula just not anything like my expectations. I would definitely not see this film again. I would not ever recommend this film to anyone either. I hate to be no negative and pessimistic in this review but I cannot help the way I feel about it. It seemed to just drag on and on and never really went any where for me. I kept zoning out. It did not hold my attention or keep my interest. It had a very sad not a feel good ending when the girl dies and the man is left alone. The only thing we had to go by was a few flash cards and it wasn't enough to keep me on top of everything that I was seeing. It was very boring to me and then with the sad ending I just didn't leave the room in a very happy mood. It was kind of quite depressing actually. This monster thing just goes around destroying and killing just about everything in its path. I am sure that I am just used to all the technologies of today and that is why I do not have very much appreciation for this film but I cannot help the era in which I was born and when this film was produced. Maybe if someone today redid it I would find it a lot more interesting and possibly even find it a great movie. You know someone should redo this old classic film. It would be very interesting to see what someone could come up with.

It's a touching moment, one of rather a few in a 1991 piece directed by Costner himself, and gets across a sense of equality between two sides whom come together through an entire clan representing one and and a lone individual representing another. The film sprawls over a number of various genres, ranging from war to romance to western, but is never sprawling in the negative sense; all this eye for scope and extravagance nicely reigned in by a man doing just as well in front of the camera as behind it. Set during The American Civil War and running on hostilities between the north and south as well as the Native Americans and the issues they have with rival clans of their own kind, the film is wonderfully low-key in its dramatisation of all this conflict and hatred boiling up between individuals; Costner's presence as this Lieutenant acting as this rock on which to map onto and observe. After all, the film unfolds in the beautiful locale of 19th Century North America - the film obliging in focusing on all the beauty of this place at times such as these amidst all the hatred and warfare, in the views; naturality of the place and eventually the love with a young Native American woman.In Dunbar, we have a lead the film is unashamedly proud in detailing as softly centered and understanding as possible. Positively pacifist in mostly everything he does, Dunbar represents the very antithesis to a Spagetti Western lead; adopting traits that are more suited to more classical western leads of great honour, courage and moral value whom are only ever as violent as they need to be when drawn into duels with the wicked. Dunbar's first action is to essentially win a battle between Union and Confederate soldiers without shooting or harming anyone. He does this by way of engaging in a suicidal act that'll come to double up as one of sheer bravery, but without ever actually killing or harming anybody; a riding up to the enemy on a horse, sacrificial Christ like pose in-tow, as enough confusion and doubt is implanted within the minds of the enemy that a frontier charge occurs.This heroic act, in the eyes of his superiors, is enough to warrant a repositioning to another front; something Dunbar requests when his dream, it appears, is to get as much out of this conflict as possible by journeying far and wide so as to lap up the surroundings amidst the ugliness of war. His posting does not go so well in the initial stages, the camp is devoid of other people and that sense of being all alone and rather vulnerable is put across by way of some uncanny stumblings across of dead animals in nearby ponds of water and an interruption to his stay in the cabin on behalf of his horse giving him a jump. It's here the film gives itself time to construct a sensitive and methodical portrait of Dunbar, a man that writes a journal in a warm and reassuring manner getting across a sense of caring to go with prior positive traits. The film goes on to use the inclusion of an animal, in this case a wolf whom Dunbar names Two Socks, to reaffirm positive; uplifting and caring traits so as to assure us our siding with him. To enhance positive characteristics, the film has Dunbar refrain from deeming the wolf a pest and therefore killing him, instead opting to write about him, in a glorious tactic designed to evoke a sense of creation in reaction to the wolf rather than destruction.But in doing so is not enough to criticise the film, rather acts as a necessary place so as to point out the time the film takes to establish character prior to the meat of the piece, that being the coming together of Dunbar with some local Native Americans; the kind that are far peaceful than certain other tribes in the area. Dunbar is bathing when the Natives first arrive, a moment in which he is at his most vulnerable and in the rawest of forms; an event that sees him cleansed of his uniform and all things that I.D. him as what he is just as those he'll come to bond with arrive for the first time. When time comes to interact with the clan on a greater scale, it'll be by way of Stands With A Fist (McDonnell), a young Native girl who's attempted suicide but is found by Dunbar, and then we remember well into his bond with them that mostly all of the people of his own kind he's interacted with so far have been anything but relatable eccentric higher-ups and grotty waggon drivers, the latter of whom Dubar describes as probably one of the foulest men I've met in my life. Dunbar connects with her because of a shared sense of alienation to the group, Stands With A Fist initially being an outsider adopted in much to the relevance of Dunbar's eventual arc towards these people.The film runs on the idea of finding solace and peace in times of war with those that you ought to be fighting, its foot entrenched in documenting the ordeals of a more classical western lead in Dunbar is deliberately clashed only with the idea to come to terms with the Native Americans, or Apaches, and come to understand them rather than utilise them as some persistently ominous, deadly off screen threat. Rather, Dances With Wolves reserves this role for that of the Ameircan soldiers as the film progresses; completing Dunbar's realisation of both the beauty of the locale and the people that inhabit it. The film is an affecting effort, broad in a sense of scope and style.
