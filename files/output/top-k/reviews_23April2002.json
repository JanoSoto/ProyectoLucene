Lots of 'cool' action sequences, i.e. martial art fights,  hero doing feats only a half human\/half vampire hero could possibly do.  Oh yeah, and lots of *really* 'cool' gore.  Heavy metal music, blood, blood and, yes you've guessed it, more blood.  This was Blade. Blade 2 is, as one might expect, more of the same.  Unfortunately, the film is worse than the original in several ways, albeit slightly.  In Blade, when a vampire was destroyed, there was a subtle difference in the way the creatures disappeared; some of them burst into flames, some of them splattered, some of them turned to dust, etc.  In Blade 2, the creatures disintegrate in exactly the same way each time; a way which stank very much of an over-reliance on computer generated imagery. This made the deaths look cheaper, more fluid and slick perhaps, but less visceral and impactive, like a 'made for television' version of Blade.   The resurrection of the character Whistler is an awful contrivance.  By bringing Whistler back to life, the filmmakers have undercut the drama of the having him die in the original; not to mention the fact that Whistler had both *wanted* to die and done the job himself!  Why would the vampires keep him alive?  This makes no sense.  Not to use as bait to get to Blade, since they kept moving him around, all over Europe, making it (as Blade himself said) very hard for him to track him down.  Whistler was a key adversary, and he was wanted dead.  The vampires had good reason to kill him and kill him they did.  To have them then decide, in Blade 2, to keep him alive at great expense, and transport him around the world from location to location, is nonsensical!  So all one can make of this is that it was deemed (by studio executives) a safer bet for the financial success of the film, to have Chris Kristofferson back &#150; forget about art, Hollywood is about making money!  What they don't realise is that better movies make *more* money still! It has been said that Blade 2 has been 'Matrixed', which is a very apt observation.  There is even a team, similar to the one in The Matrix, of anti-heroes - the vampire squad that was being trained to take out Blade, each with their own 'cool' name!  I mean, 'The Priest'!  *Please*!   Loads of extra martial arts, al la The Matrix, loads more black costumes, al la The Matrix, more fast music and destructive mayhem, al la The Matrix.  This is all about 'fashion filmmaking' &#150; merely looking at what is going down well at the moment and copying the style.  Buffy the Vampire Slayer is big, Angel is big, the Matrix is big (and a sequel is due out soon)... so lets just jump on the bandwagon. The director could have stuck with the unique look of the original and remained a trend *setter*, instead he has sunk to becoming a mere trend follower. One interesting aspect of the movie is the *computer generated* Blade and enemies; these shots, although they were noticeable as CG images, mark a significant leap forward in what can be achieved in superhero films.  With the forthcoming Spider-man, I am intrigued by these developments.  Maybe the techniques aren't refined enough yet for the sophisticated viewers of special effects that we have become, but they soon will be.  Then directors of escapist films in the superhero genre will really be able to translate the action that was previously only possible in comic books\/graphic novels, onto the screen.

Unfortunately, neither Stiller nor Allen were involved with this movie, which in the final analysis, is much `less.'  As in `witless,' `tasteless' and `humorless.'  Oh, it'll make you laugh at times, but you'll hate yourself in the morning for it.  Simply put, in regards to credible comedy, `Little Nicky,' directed by Steven Brill, comes in somewhere near the bottom of the food chain, cinematically speaking.

Suffice to say that his decision is not well received by the boys, however-- at least not by Adrian and Cassius, who rebel by bolting from this most southern of regions to take up residence in the topside world of the mortals, the souls of whom it is their inherent duty to corrupt.  But in so doing, they inadvertently freeze the fire at the gates of Hell, rendering them impassable to all the fallen souls who would enter there; and so it is destined to remain until the two return, which they are not likely to do of their own accord.  The situation quickly takes it's toll on the health of Satan, who in his suddenly weakened state is unable to pursue the errant pair himself, and since only a spawn of Satan can match up to another spawn of Satan, the job falls to Little Nicky-- the only other one around who meets the criteria-- who is summarily dispatched to earth to collect his brothers and bring them back down to Hell, whereupon the fire will be rekindled, the gates reopened, and all will once again be...well...'bad.'  It's a tough assignment, though, as Nicky's brothers have the ability to possess anyone in the world they so choose, which will make identifying them something of a problem.  Not to worry, however; Satan is providing some help for Nicky-- a dog named Mr. Beefy (voice of Robert Smigel), who has experience among the mortals, and will be able to help Nicky negotiate what to him will be virgin territory.  And with that, Nicky is off on his quest-- and the laughs begin.  Not!\tThe story itself is a flight of fancy, a fantasy, which on paper at any rate probably had some possibilities; if only it had been placed in more capable hands.  Brill was given a golden opportunity to deliver a movie with some real snap and zing to it, but he dropped the ball, big time, and instead presents the material with little imagination, and the result is a very basic what-you-see-is-what-you-get type of film.  There's just nothing beneath the surface at all.  Sure, it's a comedy (and that's debatable), but even a film that's not supposed to be taken seriously has to have some substance to it, and this one does not.  It almost seems as if Brill approached the project with the attitude that Adam Sandler's presence, alone, would make whatever he put up on the screen work.  Bad miscalculation.  Scenes that could have been clever, or at least mined for some real humor, are for the most part simply crude, and in most cases lack any redeeming merit whatsoever.  His biggest mistake, though, was putting all his eggs in one basket by expecting Sandler to carry the day (and the film) just by showing up.  He apparently didn't understand that Sandler is an actor who needs a director who can keep him on task-- he needs direction, and plenty of it-- and he didn't get it from Brill.\tSandler has been better-- much better; as Robbie, in `The Wedding Singer,' for instance, or even as Bobby, in `The Waterboy.'  Both films in which he created a character that was at least credible or viable within the context of the story.  But his `Nicky' just doesn't get the job done, because he fails to even really create a character at all, but instead `plays at' creating a character, which is something else entirely.  Someone-- and the most likely suspect would be Brill-- should have told him that merely contorting his face and exaggerating the perpetually pubescent whine in his voice is not what it takes to `create' a real character.  And, regardless of the genre in which the actor is playing, it's absolutely essential that the character he presents is real and believable within the environment and the setting of the story.  If he's playing a devil in Hell, that devil had better be real, or it's simply not going to work; and this film proves it.  And lowering the bar to go after cheap laughs can't save it, either. \tThe supporting cast includes Rodney Dangerfield (Lucifer), Patricia Arquette (Valerie), Peter Dante (Peter), Jonathan Loughran (John), Dana Carvey (Referee), Jon Lovitz (Peeper), Kevin Nealon (Gatekeeper), Michael McKean (Chief of Police), Quentin Tarantino (Deacon) and Reese Witherspoon (Holly).  A real artist will earn every laugh he gets, and it's genuine; it's something real, and it's worthwhile.  This film generates some laughs, to be sure-- but they're not earned, and consequently, they're plastic, and they're disposable.  And yes, there IS a difference.  Any doubts, just ask Ben Stiller or Woody Allen.  Or Steve Martin; or Lucille Ball, Joan Davis, Red Skelton or W.C. Fields.  And while you're at it, maybe you can pass on what you learn to Adam Sandler.
