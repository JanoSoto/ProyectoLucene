Random Threats from an Unarmed American. In a hilarious whirlwind tour across the United States that takes him from Milwaukee, to Philadelphia, to Ft. Lauderdale, to Rockford, to Des Moines, to Harvard University and finally to his hometown of Flint, Michigan, Moore asks that fundamental question while also exposing corporate corruption and callous politicians in the Clinton-era America of the mid-1990s, and also playing good-humored pranks on the assorted media escorts hired to keep him out of trouble.Moore's book tour travels are mixed with blazing stand-up comedy and visits with out-of-work or soon-to-be out-of-work employees at these major companies that are making record-setting profits but continue to lay off their workers, when they should be hiring more workers. He also talks clandestinely with employees at a Des Moines Borders who were forced out of a book-signing and also had money being taken out of their paychecks to pay for a doctor as part of an out-of-state health care plan. These same workers were also trying to organize a labor union.He also meets a woman at a book-signing who was laid off earlier that day and she wanted desperately to meet him. We are also quite startled to learn that TWA has found cheap labor in prison convicts for their phone-answering services. At the end, he's granted with his first (and only) interview with the C.E.O. of Nike, which has a company in Indonesia that hires underage workers. Moore offers numerous challenges to which the chairman turns them all down - exposing his callousness and greed - and the C.E.O. finally caves to donate $10,000 to Flint, Michigan's struggling school system.The Big One is perhaps Moore's most underrated feature. Of course the film seems like a time capsule 11 years later since corporate downsizing and corruption have taken a backseat to terrorism, America's simultaneous conflicts with terrorists in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the global War on Terror. But I also have to say that The Big One is perhaps Moore's funniest film to date (my personal favorite is his 2004 anti-Bush Fahrenheit 9\/11, and I have yet to read Downsize This!). But underneath the biting comedy, there is also a strong sense of anger and sadness that Moore delivers with some pretty strong passion. Some bits of The Big One are just downright depressing. He knows something's wrong with all the big corporations that continue making record profits but lay off the workers when they should be hiring more.While the movie is incredibly funny, Moore has been criticized for not offering solutions to all the people he encounters. The answer is simple, he just doesn't have any. There's nothing he can do to change the minds of greedy executives who would send jobs abroad rather than keep them here in America because they don't have to pay the workers as much. He's only one man who has been the ire of corporate America for nearly 20 years now, and it doesn't seem like he's any closer to winning his crusade.The Big One is Moore's Big One, all right, full of humor and satire aimed at his one true enemy, corporate America. It's not his best movie, but it proves that he still has the ability to expose corruption everywhere he sees it and show us that something is indeed wrong in this Land of the Free.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 July 2008","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" From the back of the DVD cover of The Big One If Fortune 500 companies are posting record-setting profits, why do they continue laying off thousands of workers?That's the fundamental question this movie poses to the viewer.In The Big One, filmmaker Michael Moore goes on a Random House book tour promoting Downsize This!

Until I saw this movie, Warren Beatty has always come across to me as your basic Hollywood liberal -- elitist without reason and in possession of values at war with those of most of his countrymen. And given the subject matter of this biopic, I fully expected it to be a glorification of Reed's life. It's anything but, though Reed is the movie's protagonist.What it is, by contrast, is primarily the love story between Reed and Bryant. Given the leftist ideas of free love, which the movie also explores, the very notion of a love story is anathema to the supposed political beliefs of the Bolsheviks and those in the American and European left. The notion of love and self-sacrifice were denigrated by the left as bourgeois concepts. Hammering my point home, O'Neill at one point even accuses Bryant of cynically pretending to be about free love to win a marriage proposal from Reed. Within the context of the movie, that's probably unfair. Bryant thought she was about free love until she met Reed. Reed thought he was about free love until he met Bryant and until Bryant gave herself to O'Neill.What the moviegoer should conclude from all of this is is that the left-wing notion of free love is empirically unsustainable and bankrupt as an idea. At the end of the movie, just before Reed dies (or just before Bryant learns Reed dies), she drops a cup she was taking to get him some water, as he lay on his death bed. A small boy picks the cup up and hands it to Bryant. The boy, perhaps 4 years old, returns to his seat, smiling at Bryant. Earlier in the movie, when Reed was diagnosed with kidney disease, he asked his doctor if that would affect his ability to have children (the answer was no). The closing scene with the boy is meant to call that to mind. In other words, after all of his trials, Bryant sees the child, and the moviegoer gets the message -- Reed and Bryant have effectively wasted their lives. They've wasted their lives (more Reed than Bryant) striving for their beliefs, which in the end turn out to have been painfully naive. What they missed were multiple years in which they could have been together in bourgeois happiness. (The movie repeatedly shows Reed and Bryant's happiest moments as being precisely those where they were together, in America, living a middle class or lower middle class life -- making dinner, playing with their dog, or making love.) And what they missed because of Reed's misplaced revolutionary fervor was the opportunity to have children and raise a family together. In short, they missed the basic point of life, and only realized it too late.As an aside, I didn't expect this from Beatty, one of Hollywood's most notorious womanizers. But I think what it shows is that he was a romantic at heart all along. And given that he's still married to Annette Benning, after lots of profound public expressions of love -- which at the time I discounted as so much Hollywood showboating -- I think Beatty just found the one he was searching for. The right has its lotharios, like the left, and it's easy to understand a handsome man with a strong libido chasing so many skirts. The point is that eventually Beatty did settle down. I think the denunciations of his by many of his former lovers is because they wanted to be the one, but only late in his life did Ms. Benning get his heart.

The vast majority of the plot has been left out due to time restraints on a contract or something like that, so there is no legend of the twins, and Lestat's actual maker Magnus is not mentioned at all.

Things continue to get worse as is turns out Regan is responsible for the murder of film director Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran), desperate Chris turns to Father Damian Karras (Jason Miller) for help who after his own investigation is convinced Regan is possessed by a demon & recommends to the Church that an exorcism be performed...Directed by William Friedkin one probably has to say that The Exorcist is one of the most famous & widely regarded horror films ever made with reports of audience members vomiting, fainting & mass walk-outs in theatres the film has a definite controversy & legacy surrounding it. Originally released on Boxing Day 1973 in the US at around the two hour mark The Exorcist was re-released in 2000 with about twelve minutes of restored footage & some subtle CGI work under the title The Exorcist The Version You've Never Seen & it is this longer cut that I will be basing my comments on. The script by William Peter Blatty which was based on his novel stands up pretty well when viewed today, there's real building of momentum as the film starts off with a very normal mother & daughter only for the film to show Regan get worse & worse & the effect it has on the people around her & as it all snowballs. At first Regan's mother tries to cure her daughter with modern medical science but when that fails more unorthodox methods are used. The film has lots of religious overtones which probably didn't go down to well at the time of it's release with some really foul language, scenes of defiled statues in Church, Regan masturbating with a crucifix & the eventual exorcism which the film ultimately builds up to. The character's are very good, the film certainly held my interest throughout even though I generally dislike long films & there are one or two iconic & memorable set-pieces like the head twisting scene & of course the green vomit the possessed Regan spews over Karras. My only real problem is that The Exorcist goes on for a bit too long, while I didn't get bored I did start to look at the clock, it's never explained what the mysterious noises in the attic were & I wasn't keen on the new ending with Kinderman & Dyer walking off to the 'this could be the start of a beautiful relationship' line.With a filming schedule that was originally planned for 85 days yet went on for 224 the film has a certain intensity & a cold matter of fact style about it, the camera remains quite static & the shots are very long unlike films today where it looks like the cameraman is having a fit & the editing is so quick you can barely tell whats happening. There are some great moments & I especially love the unexpected jump scare in the attic when the candle bursts into flame, it's such a cheap scare effect yet so effective. The Exorcist isn't the goriest or most violent film ever made, there's only two dead bodies in it, some blood in a medical scene & that's about it, it's probably the disturbing nature of the things that happen that are so effective & memorable rather than because they are graphic. The special make-up effects by Oscar winner Dick Smith are superb as you would expect. Watching the extended version last night I was very aware of how little music there is in the film, in fact apart from the opening & closing credits I can't actually remember any during the film itself at all. There's a definite sense of unease & dread as the film builds up to it's climax & this is where I personally think the film fails to deliver, after such an excellent sustained build up the ending is nothing more than two guy's standing around a bed chanting silly sounding religious lines of dialogue.With a supposed budget of about $10,000,000 The Exorcist is very well made & certainly looks good if a little basic by todays standards. The special effects are good & the new extended cut doesn't go overboard on the CGI. Filmed throughout New York, the Warner Bros. studios in California, Washington & Iraq in which an all British film crew were hired since the US had no diplomatic relations with Iraq back then, not that they do now of course either! The acting is very good from a strong cast, although Linda Blair played the possessed Regan & was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress for the role she was actually dubbed throughout.The Exorcist is regarded as some sort of landmark classic in the horror genre which I suppose it is & while it's an undeniably great film all round I don't hold it in such high regard since it's just not that much fun to watch. Followed by the entertainingly awful Exorcist II The Heretic (1977), the average Exorcist III (1990) & the rather excellent prequel Exorcist The Beginning (2004) which itself was re-cut & altered & re-released as Dominion Prequel to the Exorcist (2005).

Ulmer had little to work with - a strong but depressing plot, some well-developed characters, an excellent femme fatale (Ann Savage), and a script which, at times, seems to have ambitions that exceed its scope and budget. Yet, he made a film which would strongly influence and help to define a major developing genre in mainstream film for decades.Detour's status in the noir canon has more to do with its innovations than the film's quality or entertainment value. Think structure and plotting The story takes a few catastrophic twists along the way, people die, the film is shadowy (but not nearly as stylized as later noir), there is an unforgettable femme fatale (Savage), voice-over narrative and a lot of driving.Don Neal passably plays a talented pianist engaged to a lovely, vivacious jazz singer (Claudia Drake). Al Roberts, however, is not just a piano player. He is a classic mope, whining his way through life and searching for new excuses and new pathways to failure. Although Neal's acting does little to improve the sympathetic development of this character, his charming relationship with Sue (Drake) and his musical talent spare him from complete audience detachment. The story foreshadows Al's fate pretty nicely, but the series of events that lead up to it are still somewhat shocking. I won't discuss the plot twists - which are the film's key elements, except to say that they are why Detour is worth watching - especially Ann Savage's exceptionally tough and yet powerfully sympathetic performance.Road movies are a a strong but uneasy subgenre in Noir. Detour innovates in both of these areas, and does so powerfully. Ulmer's directorial talents save this film - the story line could have been an absolute train-wreck in less talented hands. The film is, essentially, over-the-top, depressing, and just a bit fantastic. Voice-over is used to hurry the plot along, and unfortunately, this happens in several key places. While voice over would become a hallmark of noir as the genre developed,its use was certainly not perfected here, and the problems seem to result from budgetary and scope constraints, not artistic decisions. Aside from Savage and good support from Edmund McDonald, the cast is weak. There are also considerable set limitations. Luckily, Ulmer would continue to innovate and skirt the mainstream throughout most of his career - maintaining a kind of independence that today's financially backed indy directors would have some difficulty understanding. Generally, his films are worth seeing - and not just for film buffs. ","genre":null},{"date":"18 July 2008","score":"","review":" Talented, somewhat experimental, director Edward G.

They are not all necessarily bad, but they have a distinct 80's feel. This is not as much of a problem with Back to the Future, probably because a large part of it does not take place in the 80's! Although it does have more of an 80's feel than its sequels, I think Back to the Future will be enjoyed by audiences for many more years to come. The film has a wonderful blend of comedy, science fiction, and action so that it works on many different levels. Robert Zemeckis and the crew were able to create a perfect 1950's atmosphere, with great sets, 50's music, and 50's television shows.Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) friend Doctor Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd) invents a time machine out of a Delorean (a perfect choice for its futuristic look). Marty travels back to the year 1955 and accidentally prevents his father from meeting his mother, endangering his own existence. He must enlist the help of a younger Doc Brown to repair the time machine and get his parents together before he literally disappears! Things go awry when Biff (Thomas Wilson), the bully who controls George McFly's life, interferes with Marty's plans at every turn.The relationships between these characters really elevate this film above its sequels. Lloyd and Fox have terrific chemistry and are always a riot in every scene together. Crispin Glover is hilarious as the nerdy George McFly, and Lea Thompson is a delight as Lorraine Banes, Marty's mother. Marty's scenes with his parents remind us that our parents were once teenagers too. Marty learns that he has more in common with his parents than he thought. He has the same fears as his father and his mother's rebellious spirit. Lorraine develops a crush on Marty that should be disgusting, but Thompson's charm and Fox's awkwardness make it hilarious.I should devote some credit to the film's special effects and action scenes. In order to go forward in time, Marty and Doc have to harness the energy from a bolt of lightning and channel it into the flux capacitor (which makes time travel possible) while driving the Delorean at 88 miles per hour. This sequence remains one of the most exciting scenes I have ever watched, in large part due to Alan Silvestri's score, and I love how they were able to give the clock tower a significant role in every Back to the Future movie. The time machine going back in time is just as impressive today.Back to the Future is my favorite film by Robert Zemeckis, and I doubt he will top it.

However, there is one passion that all directors inevitably share, and that is for cinema itself. Films like Woody Allen's 'The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985)' and, more recently, Michel Gondry's 'Be Kind Rewind (2008),' exhibit such affection towards movies and movie-making that no film-lover can help but like them. In 1988, Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore released 'Nuovo cinema Paradiso \/ Cinema Paradiso,' his personal ode to the magic of movies and the humble small-town cinema. After a poor local performance, the film was sheered down to 123 minutes (from 155 minutes), and subsequently went on to win both the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and the Best Foreign-Language Film Oscar. In 2002, a 170-minute director's cut marketed in the United States as 'Cinema Paradiso The New Version', which restored all of the original future, was released into theatres. As the director's cut was the only version to which I had ready access, this was the one that I watched for the first time. The director's cut is notable in that it greatly expands on Alfred's role in Toto's life and career.In the hustle-and-bustle of modern Rome, acclaimed film director Salvatore Toto Di Vita (Jacques Perrin) returns home to a sad message from his elderly mother Alfredo has died. During the night, the man reflects on his childhood, when, as a bright and fervent young boy (played by Salvatore Cascio), he used to frequent his small town's local cinema, where the friendly projectionist, Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) taught him, however reluctantly, the tricks of the trade. Flash forward several years, and Toto is now a mature and intelligent teenager, falling for the first (and only) time into the throes of young love. Though I have not seen the shortened theatrical version, from what I've been able to gather, the story doesn't delve too deeply into the adventures of the adult Toto. In the director's cut, most of the additional running time is dedicated to his home-town return, as he is drawn almost overwhelmingly into the regretful ghosts of his past. These sequences are, of course, not without interest, but Tornatore is at his strongest in the first act, with Toto as an impressionable young boy immersed in the joy of cinema.Philippe Noiret is wonderful as the warm and occasionally brusque film projectionist, and his interactions with Toto (especially young Salvatore Cascio) develop into a powerful father-son relationship. The director's cut intriguingly suggests that Alfred deliberately mislead Toto about Elena (Agnese Nano, later Brigitte Fossey) in order to preserve his chances of succeeding with his #1 love of all, movies. Alfred suspected that, had Toto married Elena, he would never have been able to become an accomplished film director &#150; as a beloved father figure for the boy, he made the difficult decision that Toto could never have made. The ethical complications of Alfred's decision are problematic, but one can at least follow his logic, and his motives, however misguided, were certainly well-intended. At the film's end, as the adult Toto is doubting his love for cinema, his passion is reassured with a wonderful montage of the romantic moments that the town's prudish priest had once sliced from every film to be screened in his theatre. This is the magic of cinema. It's not just the films themselves, but also the flood of personal memories that accompanies each forbidden screen embrace.

Essentially, this film is rather offensive in that all sexuality is in word only, no visible affection between men and ultimately this reads as homophobic when the film itself self-censures in not exposing the audience to what is the only expression of any sexuality sex or any type of physical demonstration of affection. We are left with a film full of references to gay men, no demonstration of any form of homosexuality, and a humour built entirely around this imaginary sexuality that, were it shown in any kind of real way, would have turned off many of the members of the audience from writing reviews like one of the best films about this subject. It is easy to like this subject when you don't ever have to see it or honestly engage it outside of parody.

With that in mind, as no reader could feasibly read with the intent of deciding whether the film is bad or good, this review will focus on a more comprehensive breakdown of the film's countless flaws. And rest assured that no matter how many innumerable detractions the movie has garnered, its atrocities becoming almost over-hyped, the film still manages to astound by the numerous fronts in which it completely fails to register any vestige of quality whatsoever. Even those seeking the film as an entertainingly terrible comedy will find themselves disappointed, as the film somehow manages to avoid the pitfall of usual B movie melodramatic hysteria, emerging as simply dull and all the more terrible as consequence. The film's complete lack of quality becomes instantly clear from the chaotically choppy cinematography and editing, betraying the film's seemingly near non-existent budget. Similarly, the creative black hole of a script somehow bests its own storyline absurdities by shamelessly stealing elements from Spielberg's classic original through clunky, senseless flashbacks (Ellen Brody recalls her husband killing the shark, despite not having been there to witness it) and in certain cases blatant plundering and rehashing of scenes (the charming interplay between Roy Scheider and his son from the first Jaws is leeringly plagiarized, devoid of any redeeming values whatsoever). All of which goes without mentioning the most glaring absurdities of the very premise a shark seeking vengeance against family members of one who once killed a completely unrelated shark, enough so to track them to the Bahamas shows such a staggering lack of logic that one wonders how the film could possibly have been greenlit in the first place. But in this twisted reality, such qualms are easily explained away, as is the shark's outracing planes, standing on its tail, roaring and spontaneously combusting - it is difficult to imagine anything sealing the film's utter absence of quality any further. While Spielberg masked the clunky falsities of his mechanical shark by mostly obscuring it with subjective point of view camera work, director Joseph Sargent appears to positively revel in his antagonist's foibles, keeping his obviously fake shark in plain view to a comical extent. Similarly, viewers are even denied a high body count of entertainingly poor shark attacks, as the film's near non-existent carnage is devoid of any campy gruesomeness, resorting to extreme close-ups of the absurdly unconvincing attacks, generating less menace than watching a snail crawl. As a secondary character, the relatively poor acting of Lorraine Gary's Ellen Brody was for the most part easy to miss, but thrust into a lead role and her complete lack of a performance is unmistakable. Embarrassingly melodramatic or completely devoid of emotion depending on the scene, the banality of Gary's imbalanced attempted character is one of the film's weaker points, which is saying a lot.

Welcome to Creepshow, the awesome anthology film that first scared the hell out of me 26 years ago, and was responsible for turning me into the horror movie freak that I am today!Directed by genre great George Romero, this loving tribute to the classic scary E.C. publications of the 50s opens with a horror-loving kid (played by Stephen King's son, Joe) having his copy of the titular comic thrown in the garbage by his overbearing and disapproving father. Outside, the wind whips open Creepshow's putrid pages to reveal five terrifying tales of the macabre.Scary story number one is called Father's Day every year, on Father's Day, rich, old, eccentric Aunt Bedelia returns home for a family reunion, and to visit the grave of her dear old dad, whose brains she bashed in with an ashtray. This year, however, dotty Bedelia gets a surprise when dear old daddy rises from his grave, with a hunger... for cake!Setting the tone of this fun film perfectly, this first tale features marvellously hammy performances from Viveca Lindfors as Jim Beam-guzzling Bedelia and Carrie Nye as raspy-voiced Sylvia Grantham, plus a wonderfully mouldy zombie courtesy of FX maestro Tom Savini (who lends his expertise to all of the stories). This is grisly schlock-horror at its finest.Best scary moment Zombie hand!Most disturbing thing about this episode Ed Harris disco dancing!Tale number two is The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill a boss-eyed, goofy hick (played by Stephen King) turns into a walking space-weed after investigating a meteor that lands in his yard.The only weak link in the whole film, this is one tale that should've been left on the cutting room floor.Scariest thing about this episode Give me a minute, will you...Tale number three is entitled Something To Tide you Over Cheer's bartender Ted Danson and Gaylen Ross (from Dawn of the Dead) play a pair of adulterous lovers who suffer a watery fate at the hands of mad millionaire Richard Vickers (a brilliant turn by Naked Gun star Leslie Nielsen), but who return from the dead to exact a fitting revenge.A brilliantly atmospheric story, with good use of a remote locale and some great scares, this is perhaps my favourite of all of the stories.Best scary moment The bit where Nielsen locks himself into a room, only to discover that nowhere is safe from vengeful, seaweed-covered zombies.Most disturbing thing about this episode Nielsen's green velour tracksuit.The penultimate tale is The Crate whilst searching for a coin that has rolled under some stairs, the janitor at Amberson Hall, Horlicks University, discovers a mysterious, old crate, nailed shut and wrapped in chains. Believing the box to be of some importance (it is stencilled with the words Arctic Expedition and dated June 19th 1834) he calls Professor Stanley, and the two of them prise the crate open. Big mistake!Relentlessly scary, with some great gore effects, this one is memorable for it's marvellously toothy monster, and a great turn by Adrienne Barbeau as the obnoxious wife of Professor Stanley's best bud, Henry Northrup.Best gore effect Grad student Charlie (not yet 21, but looking at least 35) having his neck chewed on by 'Fluffy'.Most disturbing thing about this episode Adrienne Barbeau's portrayal of bitchy Billie.The final tale in the comic is They're Creeping Up On You E. G. Marshall plays Upson Pratt, an obnoxious, germophobic, multi-millionaire recluse who treats people like bugs he squashes them without a second thought. However, he gets his comeuppance when his hermetically sealed apartment proves to be less than effective and becomes over-run with cockroaches.An excellent performance from Marshall, and a delightfully grisly payoff save this otherwise rather dull story.Best gore effect the one at the end, of course!Most disturbing thing about this episode Upson Pratt's name and his kerazee hair.The film finishes with a suitably creepy ending in which the mean, old dad from the beginning of the film learns the hard way that trashing comic-books is not the done thing!Brilliantly directed, with some great animation, excellent comic-style scene transitions, suitably garish lighting, and a very atmospheric piano score by John Harrison (no relation), Creepshow is unmissable horror entertainment.

Welcome to Creepshow, the awesome anthology film that first scared the hell out of me 26 years ago, and was responsible for turning me into the horror movie freak that I am today!Directed by genre great George Romero, this loving tribute to the classic scary E.C. publications of the 50s opens with a horror-loving kid (played by Stephen King's son, Joe) having his copy of the titular comic thrown in the garbage by his overbearing and disapproving father. Outside, the wind whips open Creepshow's putrid pages to reveal five terrifying tales of the macabre.Scary story number one is called Father's Day every year, on Father's Day, rich, old, eccentric Aunt Bedelia returns home for a family reunion, and to visit the grave of her dear old dad, whose brains she bashed in with an ashtray. This year, however, dotty Bedelia gets a surprise when dear old daddy rises from his grave, with a hunger... for cake!Setting the tone of this fun film perfectly, this first tale features marvellously hammy performances from Viveca Lindfors as Jim Beam-guzzling Bedelia and Carrie Nye as raspy-voiced Sylvia Grantham, plus a wonderfully mouldy zombie courtesy of FX maestro Tom Savini (who lends his expertise to all of the stories). This is grisly schlock-horror at its finest.Best scary moment Zombie hand!Most disturbing thing about this episode Ed Harris disco dancing!Tale number two is The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill a boss-eyed, goofy hick (played by Stephen King) turns into a walking space-weed after investigating a meteor that lands in his yard.The only weak link in the whole film, this is one tale that should've been left on the cutting room floor.Scariest thing about this episode Give me a minute, will you...Tale number three is entitled Something To Tide you Over Cheer's bartender Ted Danson and Gaylen Ross (from Dawn of the Dead) play a pair of adulterous lovers who suffer a watery fate at the hands of mad millionaire Richard Vickers (a brilliant turn by Naked Gun star Leslie Nielsen), but who return from the dead to exact a fitting revenge.A brilliantly atmospheric story, with good use of a remote locale and some great scares, this is perhaps my favourite of all of the stories.Best scary moment The bit where Nielsen locks himself into a room, only to discover that nowhere is safe from vengeful, seaweed-covered zombies.Most disturbing thing about this episode Nielsen's green velour tracksuit.The penultimate tale is The Crate whilst searching for a coin that has rolled under some stairs, the janitor at Amberson Hall, Horlicks University, discovers a mysterious, old crate, nailed shut and wrapped in chains. Believing the box to be of some importance (it is stencilled with the words Arctic Expedition and dated June 19th 1834) he calls Professor Stanley, and the two of them prise the crate open.
