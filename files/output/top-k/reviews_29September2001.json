Nothing works.  Perhaps I should supply you with a list(1)  Let's start with the sorest disappointment of all the character animation, which is merely so-so.  Disney's character animation is usually superb - they have the best animators in the world, and they at least some of their animators, who have worked miracles on other projects, were set to work on this one.  What went wrong?  Maybe it's that there are no characters; maybe the character designs were unworkable (they certainly looked it).  So let's move on(2)  There are no characters.  Milo is a mere hole in the script he is insouciant when directors Trousdale and Wise think it would be amusing for him to be so, strong in resolve when the script requires, clever when the script requires, stupid when the script requires that.  He himself doesn't exist.  Neither do the mercenaries, the Atlantans - certainly not the 200+ anonymous soldiers, most of whom perish early on, without either any of the other characters, or the audience, caring.  I wasn't aware they'd even existed until after they'd died.  Maybe they didn't.(3)  Art direction is wildly inconsistent.  The Japanese do this kind of story better; whatever else Japanese animators may do wrong, they at least make it look as the characters belong in the world into which they are drawn.  Not so here.(4)  And those ninety-degree character designs - theory-driven, they neither allow good animation to be wrung out of them, nor blend in with the world in which the story takes place.  Compare with the cunning stylisation of Hercules, and weep.  And these non-angular Atlantans are just bland, bland, bland.  The female lead is the kind of thing I'd expect to see in Ferngully The Last Rainforest.  To that extent we can say that the artwork fits the story.  For...(5)  At heart this is a Saturday morning cartoon story, complete with mystical gibberish, prosaic, ready-made awe, and a moral at the end that tells us that we should ... well, respect Atlantean culture, should we ever to come across it, which we won't, and should the film have told us what this culture is, which it didn't.(6)  Computer-generated effects animation.  It's as well that this mostly consists of blue bolts of energy meeting gold bolts of energy, for that's all the technique is good for.  Disney sometimes gets the mix of CGI and hand-drawn animation exactly right - either by using no CGI at all (the simplest way, which is why their early features and The Emperor's New Groove work visually), or being cunning and sparing in the way that the CGI is used (which is why The Lion King, Hercules, Mulan, et al., work).  The mix here is ghastly.  I'm inclined to blame audiences more than the studio.  As the public's goggle-eyed reaction to Shrek shows, if you coat your shoddy, uninspired animation with enough digital varnish, nobody will notice how bad it is.(7)  Pacing is terrible.  I got the impression as far back as Beauty and the Beast that Trousdale and Wise had a poor sense of comic timing - although that film was so deeply felt it didn't matter.  Now they've sharpened their comic timing by speeding everything up.  The results are predictable (as are the jokes).  They've also sped up the dramatic timing, to the point where we've already reached Atlantis before we have any insight at all into any character's desires - before we even discover what our own desires are.(8)  The film is over-scored.  Alan Menken had a tendency to overscore, too, but Menken was both tuneful and sensitive to the demands of the moment; James Newton Howard is neither.  Besides, Menken was scoring musicals.  J.N.H. writes the underscore as if the characters are going to start singing at any moment, which they never do.Any animation studio can make a poor film; what I don't get is how the Disney studio, with a proud tradition it was continuing to live up to just the previous year, managed to make something so completely devoid of merit.  It's a glitch, an aberration, a sport.  The terrible thing is that it could spell the end of an animation studio that's nearly three-quarters of a century old.  Please let this not be so.
