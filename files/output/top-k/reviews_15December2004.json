Wells' novel. The arc of the story is exactly the same as it is in the book, but the necessary simplification that takes place in converting a novel to a film doesn't necessarily remove the meaning, but it definitely dilutes its impact. I read one review in which someone wrote that the pessimism of Wells' novel is lost in the film, which is not entirely true.What is lost is the specification that the Morlocks are the distant descendents of the working class, and the Eloi are the distant descendents of the rich upper class. You still get human descendents killing off other human descendents who have been killing them for food for who knows how long, you just miss the metaphor of the gap between the rich and the poor eventually grows so huge that they kill each other off because of their irreversible inability to coexist.As is also the case in the 2002 remake, the first half of the film is absolutely fascinating, from when the concept of time travel is introduced at the dinner party to the actual traveling through time, which features some surprising special effects showing time pass. What is not quite effective is when the time traveler stops during World War II and we are treated to a display of by far the weakest special effects in the movie, which I only criticize because they are so distantly worse than the other ones in the film. Consider, for example, the amazing effect created as one of the Morlocks decays in a matter of seconds.George has the bad luck only to stop during war, although has one great scene during World War I with the son of his friend Filby who, needless to say, he mistakes for Filby. Next stop is World War II, and then, sick of the times, an astonishing 800,000 years into the future. Good thing he didn't stop around the turn of the millennium to see if people were finally getting along, because he may have found the inspiration to travel far enough ahead in time to witness the sun burning out (as he did in Wells' novel).My biggest complaint about the film is that they got the Eloi so horribly wrong. The Morlocks, too, but at least they got the idea of the Morlocks right. They didn't look anything like they were described in Wells' novel, but they did live underground and were completely intolerant of light, despite their dwelling constantly being brightly lit. The Eloi, on the other hand, not only were not the diminutive people from the novel, who spoke an entirely new language, but they spoke perfect English and even knew what such things as books and laws were, which have been extinct or useless for centuries. And where did those talking rings come from? Technically, the movie is very impressive. Rod Taylor effectively captures the curiosity and the dedication of the Time Traveler, but does go a little overboard with his disgust at learning how much interest in knowledge has decayed in the future civilization that he finds. When he is presented with a whole library of books that have been ignored for so many centuries that they crumble to dust in his hands, he glares at the boy that brought him there and growls, What have you done! like it's the poor kid's fault. Yvette Mimieux delivers a performance as Weena that couldn't possibly be less like the Weena in Wells' novel, who saw the Time Traveler as an almost god-like savior, one that she constantly tried to pay tribute to by doing things like picking flowers and placing them in his pockets. She did not see him as her boyfriend and CERTAINLY never asked him if there was a girl like her back in his own time.However, there are a lot of deviations from the original novel that have to be allowed given the production limitations. Having the Eloi speak perfect English just seems a little too easy, I guess. In the novel, the Time Traveler gradually learned to communicate in their language. Here, communication is never an issue except when they're under the spell that the Morlocks put them under when they want to lure a lot of them underground for food. George's goal is to get the Eloi to realize what's happening and to fight for themselves. They've become complacent, and we all know that, in the process of evolution, complacency leads to becoming dinner.Having spent most of the film learning about the Eloi and trying to find where his blasted time machine disappeared to, when he finally recovers it he lectures the newly awakened Eloi and travels back to his own time, walking through the door to his own house and into the beginning of the movie. The film ends with another invention for the movie, the idea that George traveled back into the year 802,701 in order to further help the Eloi escape their dismal fate. Rather than showing George travel into the future until the earth grows dark as the sun dims and goes out, we are to assume that he went back to be with Weena. The novel ended with the possibility of sequels, the movie gives itself a clean, happy ending. But hey, it's not like it doesn't work. This is certainly a science fiction classic and wildly entertaining more than 4 decades after its release, the literary version is just a bigger science fiction classic.

'Speed' was a very successful movie for Reeves and Bullock, mainly because nothing like it came before, and it has a story line which holds your interest. Not a great movie, but always a fun one to watch again.Some SPOILERS FOLLOW, quit reading, OK. Reeves is one of the good guys here, playing Officer Jack Traven, and his nemesis turns out to be Dennis Hopper in a great role as Howard Payne. Payne booby traps a bus, such that once it gets going, explosives will go off, killing all aboard, if the speed drops below 55 miles per hour. Sandra Bullock plays Annie Porter, one of the passengers. To save everyone, Traven must jump aboard the bus, take control of the bus, helped by Porter, and get everyone off before the bus explodes.

He doesn't know anything about the casino, nor about robbing one, but if he doesn't help them, they will shoot him immediately. So he helps them robbing the casino, wearing a Santa costume, because it is Christmas...The concept is quite good, but of course not very original. In fact the whole movie is professionally done, but not that special, so don't expect anything innovating or new. However, when you can forget that for a moment you'll have some good fun watching it.

Most of them probably don't have an imagination and probably fell asleep halfway through the film because they could'not think of the horror that was unfolding in the woods. As I said before this is because they have a very poor imagination. But many people who can imagine things and enjoy this film can picture a terrifying image in their mind of the Blair Witch and what she is doing. And there is also a freaky end scene that made me stay awake for days!Now let me tell you about the film. It is basically about three students who go around with a camcorder recording everything. They then visit Burktsville and ask the locals about what they have seen or heard about the Blair Witch. If you have a good imagination then you can build up a terrifying image of the Blair Witch in your mind. They then go into the woods and get lost. That is when terrifying events start to unfold and the end scene will leave you looking around every time you hear a bump!This film deserves an 8\/10. It makes you feel like you are with the group as the footage is all shaky and it is a very low budget film( about $30,000. However if you have a bad imagination and cannot picture things in your mind very well then this film is not for you. But if you can picture things in your mind and let yourself imagine what is happening then this film is scarier than any other you will ever see. Oh, and if you really want to petrify yourself watch this film in the dark at midnight when no one else is in your house!

It also includes a few appearances of Bilbo, who is Falstaffian in his old age in a number of ways (perhaps Tolkien had this in mind), including that despite very limited paper space, he is the most vibrant, charismatic character Tolkien paints. (He also, like Falstaff, would be recognized by the audience of an extremely popular earlier work, in this case, The Hobbit--in Falstaff's case, Henry IV.)Adapting this world to the screen presents a monumental challenge, and Peter Jackson is the last person I would have considered up to it (although he had done an incredible job with a thoughtful, intellectual film once before with Heavenly Creatures). He usually creates worlds that are overdone for comic effect and seems to care more about how much blood he can throw at the audience than characters (with the exception of the aforementioned Heavenly Creatures). I would have wanted someone with his type of special effects skills, but probably Robert Zemeckis or Steven Spielberg would have been my choice for the dramatic backgrounds those two can bring along with the effects. Still, Jackson does not fall on his face (yet). He makes some poor choices--putting too much focus on Arwen, completely removing Tom Bombadil (the only character who has anywhere near Bilbo's charisma), and excising the pre-Bree difficulties of the hobbits in favor of a chase scene, not establishing hobbits' love of genealogy (necessary for the scene in the Prancing Pony), and removing Saruman's change from Saruman the White to Saruman of Many Colors--but in all he is given the space to follow the most important story--Frodo's.Despite the brilliance of Tolkien's work, his characters are not particularly deep. They're made to move the story along. (Aragorn is the one major exception--being as deep, conflicted, and moving a character as there is this side of Hamlet.) Thus, there wasn't much required from the actors, all of whom performed well with the exception of the talentless (and extraordinarily unattractive) Liv Tyler--who should simply never be given a job. In particular, Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn is perfect and Christopher Lee has exactly the right presence to pull off Saruman (I sorely missed his presence in the third installment). Ian McKellen's Oscar-nominated performance is mostly on-target, but seems to lack the vitality and edge that I always read in Gandalf. Elijah Wood is an excellent casting choice not because of any talent, but because those big blue eyes will create more sympathy than any writing and the audience MUST sympathize with Frodo. Ian Holm absolutely pulsates with energy in his marvelous performance as Bilbo Baggins, as I said the most charismatic of Tolkien's characters. It's difficult to believe that much energy could come out of a 70-year-old man. Sean Astin also shone, as one might expect, considering his performance with a similar character in Rudy, as Samwise.Jackson's direction is good, but fairly typical epic direction. The special effects and the size effects were nothing short of amazing, but the film otherwise looked like it could have been directed by anyone in Hollywood. I'm not saying it was bad; I just didn't see anything to crow about. Certainly nothing in this film can compare to what Jackson accomplished with Heavenly Creatures.In all, this is a surprisingly excellent adaptation of a brilliant novel. It stays truer to the novel than I expected, though the changes in Ralph Bakshi's cartoon version were much more sensible and intelligent, if you ask me; its performances are mostly at least as good as can be expected; and the effects are marvelous. The major letdowns are the excruciatingly long love scene of Aragorn and Arwen and the (as expected) pathetic performance of Liv Tyler.As a note to all Tolkien fans, this film follows the novel surprisingly well and most of the cuts and changes aren't bad. It overemphasizes Arwen and excises the Barrow-wights (I don't have my books with me, so I'm just going to hope I spelled that right) and Tom Bombadil, but it's surprisingly close.I consider Ralph Bakshi's cuts for his film more sensible (excising Arwen and having Legolas meet the hobbits on their way to Rivendell instead of Glorfindel, where this film has Arwen meeting them), but the live action makes a huge difference for me and sets this film on top as the best Lord of the Rings adaptation. But be very wary of the third film, which has some unforgivable deviations from Tolkien.

It's an uncompromising story of love and loss, of life and death, of war and peace, and of beauty and ugliness. The first thing one initially realizes, from the first few seconds of this beautiful film, is the score. James Horner wonderfully captures the sentiment of medieval Scotland. The romantic, elevating, crisp freshness of the bagpipes feels like the cool mist of a Scottish morning. It captures the self sacrifice, the pain in the heart, the emotion of all the characters and just makes the film that much more rich and alive. With regard to sets, the production is just amazing. The little villages, the rustic and primitive houses, the marketplace, the reconstruction of Edinburgh and York, and other cities in that time, is absolutely amazing, it looks like one would imagine it looked back then.The editing is phenomenal. Braveheart has some of the most relentless and graphic battle scenes ever caught on film. Both the filmed battles, that of Stirling and Falkirk, are amazing, and viciously real. The acting is superb. James Robinson, who plays the young William Wallace, is excellent. Particularly in the scene where he mourns his father and brother, and he weeps as the little girl, Murron (Mhairi Calvey) runs up and gives him a thistle. Patrick McGoohan is excellent as the villainous Edward I The Longshanks. He has a great voice, so much character, he really commands the screen in all his scenes. Sophie Marceau is graceful and elegant as Princess Isabelle, but at the same time she shows strength, especially in scenes where she is juxtaposed to McGoohan. The lovely Catherine McCormack plays the adult Murron, and her beauty and natural presence just gives the film so much fuel. Although her role isn't very long, her presence resonates throughout the movie, and she returns in key moments to remind the viewer of this phenomenal, pure, loving bond she has with William. Even Mel says of McCormack, I fell in love a little. And so does the audience. Stephen the Irishman is, next to Mel Gibson, the best acted character in the movie. Mel Gibson is excellent as William Wallace, and as a director, is insightful, ambitious and visionary. The sheer size of this film, let alone the size of the character, and the way he took on both with such passion and ease--one cannot help but applaud his endurance, his talent, his portrayal behind the camera and in front of it. Randall Wallace writes a wonderful screenplay, and Mel Gibson brings it to life.Having said all this, I have to share some of my favorite shots 1) Little Murron, running up with the thistle to give it to William. It illustrates wanting to console in times of pain. Both the gesture and the plant itself has a beauty--a flower--but it also illustrates the pain--a thistle has thorns--that is the other side of the coin. 2) The virgin bride who stops the feuding between the Scots and the English, when the lord comes and claims the rights of prima noctes. She, of her own will, takes the hands of the English soldier off of her, and off of her husband, and willingly offers herself in sacrifice, so gracefully. The flowers in her hair are not unlike the way the ancients would put flowers on the head of animal sacrifices. 3) The scene of William and Murron after they have been married, and they are about to consummate their marriage. The shot is all dark, but you can see the mist of their breath. The breath shows emotion, it shows life, it shows freedom. It is perhaps one of the most meaningful shots in the film. Finally, I have to share some of my favorite lines 1)I know you can fight, but it's our wits that make us men. 2) The Almighty says this must be a fashionable fight, its drawn the finest people! 3) If he were here he'd consume the English with fireballs from his eyes, and bolts of lightning from his arse. 4) And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willing to trade all they days from this day to that for one chance--just one chance--to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom. 5)The Lord tells me he can get me out of this mess, but He's pretty sure, you're fucked! 6) A lordship and titles, gold--that I should become Judas? 7) Every man dies, not every man really lives.Braveheart grabs the viewer from the first shot and does not let them go until the ending credits.

On one side at least 3 hours long, period piece and in French with subtitles. On the other side a vicious CGI beast, gratuitous violence and martial arts. Co-existing within each other like a Reese's Cups. Somehow, it manages to work, though it's still pretty sublime like one of Aesop's Fables for adults.Loosely based on a true story about a killer wolf in 19 century France, BOTW is a mess of a movie that works best as schlock. Don't get too bogged down by the accuracy of the period, costumes or the acting. This is pure B-movie territory in drag. Liberties are obviously taken but those 3 hours seem to glide by. Like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the subtitles go down easy and don't seem to get in the way of the story or the action. Unless your still at a 5th grade reading level. Fronsac (Samuel Le Bihan) and his Native American assistant, Mani (Mark Dacascos) are naturalists called upon to help capture and slay the beast only to find out that this is no mere wolf and there's more to the attacks than just predatory actions. There's also a brotherhood of crooked politicians with a hidden agenda.Le Bihan (looking like a tamer David Lee Roth) is a charmer. Instead of a geeky, Jim Fowler-type, he plays his role of naturalist like a lady killer, later becoming a badass when the need to avenge a friend comes out.Dacascos is the real showstopper. Playing a mostly quiet Indian, his scene-stealing martial arts make this movie worth seeing. The son of a world-renowned martial arts instructor, Dacascos has been starring in his own straight-to-video releases for over 10 years now including one of the Kickboxer sequels and the slick Jackie Chan-like Drive, his best.

One deleted scene is especially cool In the beginning of the theatrical version when we first encounter Fronsac and Mani, they come upon a girl being attacked by a group of bandits. Mani gets off his horse and introduces his fighting skills.

This movie got away from me until recently. I saw in the library video section and decided to check it out. The box is very misleading.

Though he has a wife back in his homeland (she is only mentioned, not seen), he marries a white Englishwoman, Ella (Lynda Bassett). They have 7 kids 6 boys and 1 girl. Flash forward to the late 60s (where the movie actually begins) and we see his kids are truly English in behavior though he stresses that they must go to Mosque to study and worship. His oldest is to be wed in an arranged marriage to a woman he hardly knows. He runs out in the middle of the ceremony in fear, embarrassing his family especially his father who disowns him. This sets the tone of the movie. His kids are English-born and want to live like their friends in their working-class neighborhood but George wants to raise them as traditional Muslims, despite opposition from his wife, Ella, who only wants the kids to be happy. She tries to help them avoid run-ins with their father who despite his cheerfulness is quite an ogre when angered. The kids range in attitude and indifference toward George's attempts to introduce them to the traditional ways. This is a decent introduction to immigrant life in the UK especially since it's set during a time when there was political strife over immigration of non-whites into Britain. Though it's an effective comedy, it also touches on the frustration immigrants of any culture go through to hold onto or reject their identity.

Willem DaFoe, to his credit, tries hard as the villain, but he is just an unintentionally comic and moronic madman, and the rest of the characters are cardboard cutouts. Where's Dennis Hopper when you need him? An action-packed thriller? A love story? How about just a severe case of seasickness? Eeeeewwwwwwww . . . . . .

I remembered it as being a critically reviled movie that prompted one of two responses &#150; it's so bad it's good, or it's so bad it's&#133;just bad. Meet Joe Black is quite possibly one of the worst movies that I've ever had to endure. The script, or the mess that resulted from reassembling the shredded remains of a dozen rewrites, was so bad as to be funny. On several occasions, my wife and I laughed out loud at the mock sincerity and vapid attempts at 'meaning' and 'depth'. The entire thing sounds like the laughable doom laden poetry of a maudlin teenager. The actors, left with nothing of any substance to work with, and operating under a director who clearly has intellectual aspirations far above his capabilities, struggle to create characters that amount to anything more than shameless pouting and vacant stares into the middle distance. Buried beneath the portentous dialogue, the awkward performances, the dull production design and wildly inconsistent storyline, there IS a kernel of a decent story. Had we been able to focus on Joe Black and follow his own emotional journey as he weaves between the variously dysfunctional members of the Parrish family, playing with the irony of death healing these people's wounds, something of value may have resulted, but alas, it's not to be. Even my wife, a hardcore fan of every romance put to screen, found the whole thing to swing wildly from embarrassment to tedium.The blame for this entire mess can only be laid at the feet of Martin Brest, a director of very little evident talent who created a reasonably enjoyable buddy cop movie 20 years ago and has been riding on the wake of it's success ever since. He should stop deluding himself, his actors and audiences, that he is capable of subtlety or intelligence. Hopefully, Gigli will be the death of him.As for a rating, let's give it a 3 out of 10, out of respect for capable actors put in an impossible situation.

This is such an old movie I figured it wouldn't matter too much. Read this after you've seen the movie for an avid fan's view of it.The Quiet Man is my favorite film because two major themes are the role of a woman in a traditional society and dealing with anger constructively.Mary Kate Danaher is not quite what we've come to think of as a traditional woman. She is fiery, not passive or submissive although she clearly understands her role as a woman and lives within it. She knows who she is and what she wants and resists being pushed around as much as she can within the limits that have sustained her culture for centuries. The dowry is the key to her role in society. It's a tradition that gives her dignity. Mary Kate delivers my favorite feminist speech in a film when she comes home after the wedding. The most memorable line in the speech for me is Without my things about me, I'm still a servant dreaming amongst the things that aren't my own. Without the dowry she's been handed over from one man to another with nothing of her own, so she feels like a prostitute. Makes sense to me.The other theme, anger management, explains Sean Thornton's refusal to fight for the dowry. He believes he can't fight without being mad enough to kill. To keep his wife he has to find a way to get her dowry without fighting and possibly killing her brother. He finally figures it out. Play the Irish game. Call the brother-in-law's bluff. It's your custom. No dowry, no marriage. he says to her brother. After the brother grudging hands over the dowry Sean _and_ Mary Kate burn it in front of the brother-in-law and the whole community. They all know it was never really about furniture or money. When there's no more reason to be angry the two men slug it out just to see who's the better fighter. And its a great fight scene. The fight scene alone is worth watching the movie.Technical aspects of the film are also wonderful in my opinion. I especially love the rich, beautiful technicolor images of Maureen O'Hara in Ireland. The role of Sean Thornton seems made for John Wayne. (It probably was.) But its what the film says to me that keeps me watching it over and over.
