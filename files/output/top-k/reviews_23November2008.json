It features Reese Witherspoon in an early role, then sharpening her acting and comedy chops. Matthew Broderick is the top screen-time name in this epic, and he does a professional job of portraying the bored, well-meaning but weak teacher whose downfall is assured.There are no belly laughs in this tale; hardly a suppressed titter. Just a mildly amused smile as it winds to its inevitable conclusion. As a high school comedy, it is decidedly less raucous and more literate than most, and tries hard to play against type (such as its lovable dumb jock is here a caring and responsible kid). The movie runs flawlessly to its end without any hullabaloo, gets there, and nails the door shut on all threads. It is a competent and engaging movie, but nothing special.

Or it's the Bond spoof meets the Blexploitation spoof. Anyhow it's one of the funniest comedies through one of the shortest 90 minutes movies. But it got some problems that made it away from being the smart parody it could've been._The casting  (Eddie Griffin) is good comedian but way far to be a lead. He lacked the charisma and the personal touch. (Chris Kattan) transformed the whole matter into a big silly gag, sometimes being hysterical doesn't mean laughable. (Denise Richards) don't get me starting, as an actress she's the weakest, and as a sexy mama she's not (they even had to enlarge her assets to look good at the poster !!). (Chi McBride) wasn't that good as a comedian. And finally (Aunjanue Ellis) was droll as (Sistah Girl) but not great as a (girl)! _The direction  (Malcolm D. Lee) handled it lame for most of the time. He let the jokes scenes, like all of Dave Chappelle's ones, be like a stand-up comic number or a devoted TV work. His cadres were so tide, his camera didn't move where it should be. I felt like this is just a TV sketch more than a respectable cinematic parody. Not to mention how I'm still dying to watch a parody, any parody, for the technicalities, the goofs, and the lowness of some of the Blexploitation movies, to not find it here or anywhere ! They're things begging to be spoofed._The production  it's weird, because at the end you'd witness some money here, like they were saving what they have during all the movie to spend it away at the climax only ?? Despite anything, its writer (John Ridley) made a fine comedy with some effective sarcasm aiming at the modern pop, and representing some nice black jokes about the so-called white culture. I found it too amusing to watch ideas like  a brainwash by the Mayonnaise, letting the politics to the Kentucky Fried chicken, the rap music beats the racism,.. etc. It's even an ethical movie (drugs can make you paranoiac)!. All of that in fast speed, sharp editing (sometimes), and with so brilliant dialog. Without the usual common nowadays' trash of (toilet humor, bad taste, dirty rude comedy,..).In fact it managed to be good as a spoof, but not as a very good spoof.
