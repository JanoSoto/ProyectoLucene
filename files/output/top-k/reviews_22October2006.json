Harvey Keitel plays a jazz musician sidelined by a gunshot wound who hooks up with waitress\/actress Mira Sorvino by chance. Film's objective is to show the criss-crossing patterns of human lives, as well as being a modern-day play on Pandora's Box. It features plenty of emotion and feeling, and it works wonders despite some crass dialogue and a finale that isn't really satisfying (it feels truncated). However, the central relationship between Keitel and Sorvino is tremendously charismatic; Keitel in particular is surprisingly warm and real. **1\/2 from **** ","genre":null},{"date":"22 October 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Unreleased theatrical feature, first seen on cable-TV and video, isn't particularly well-made yet has a mysterious quality and fine performances which make it worth-finding.
