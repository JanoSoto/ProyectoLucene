It has everything that anyone could possibly want. Spectacular action, state-of-the-art special effects, well-developed characters, a touching story, thought-provoking ideas, and a wonderful cast make this an awesome movie. Easily in my top five.First and foremost, the action scenes in this movie are, in my opinion, the best ones I have ever seen. Huge explosions, intense chases, awe-inspiring weaponry, and one of the most menacing bad guys I've ever seen are a great reason to see this movie, if nothing else. The chases keep getting better and better, starting with a riveting chase through a canal involving motorcycles and tractor trailer cabs and ending with a 'leaves-you-breathless' chase on a freeway with a S.W.A.T. van, a helicopter, and a tanker carrying liquid nitrogen. The weapons used are wild, most notably the scene when The Terminator obliterates the entire police force with a minigun and an M-79 grenade launcher. I could go on, but you get the idea. The action will blow you out of your seat.The special effects are, even now, some of the best I've seen on film. The CGI used here is better than half the stuff that's in movies now. The morphing and reforming effects are amazing, especially when The T-1000 gets its head blown in half and it reforms instantly. WOW! I also got a kick out of when its gun gets stuck after it morphs through the jail bars.The characters are excellent. Schwarzenegger is great in his best-known role and spits out many quotable one-liners, most notably Hasta La Vista, Baby. Arnold as a cyborg has more charisma than Keanu Reeves. He evokes compassion, sadness, laughter, and had me cheering him on the entire time. Linda Hamilton is terrific as the tough-as-nails Sarah Connor, a major change from her innocent and desperate Sarah in the first Terminator. I'd be scared to even look at her. Edward Furlong is decent as John, and is never fully annoying. My only complaint is that his voice cracks a little too much. Everyone else is fantastic.The message conveyed in T2 is very strong. We have become so dependent on technology today that it is taking over our lives. It's also developing faster and faster. It just shows you what could happen if we didn't stop to think, 'Hey, maybe we shouldn't create something that thinks just like us, and can learn at a geometric rate?' But enough preaching. The Bottom LineIf you're looking for mindless action (which I'm a big fan of too) or a compelling story, Terminator 2 Judgment Day is a superior film that mixes both of them and yields one hell of a result.

You have Wyatt and Billy played by Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper. Then you have the counterculture played by the members of the commune early in the film. Then you have the red necks who hate anyone different and will resort to violence to get people to conform. Finally you have Jack Nicholson who plays George Hanson. Hanson represents mainstream America who want to be hippies.How these characters interact for 95 minutes gives us the film.Wyatt and Billy are about selling and smoking dope and going where ever they want to go and doing what ever they want. They are individualists. They visit the commune and while they have some good times they leave because it is too constricting. Billy makes the comment at the gas station that he doesn't trust the commune guy who they give a ride too. He doesn't trust him because he is afraid he will find their money from the drug sale.Next they meet George Hanson. Hanson is intrigued by Wyatt and Billy.

Subject the events leading up to the incident at Racoon City'. The narration continues, 'At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the Umbrella corporation had become the largest commercial entity in the United States. 9 out of every 10 homes contain it's products. It's political and financial influence is felt everywhere. In public it is the worlds leading supplier of computer technology, medical products, health-care. Unknown even to it's own employees it's massive profits are generated by military technology, genetic experimentation, viral weaponry'. The film then cuts to a seemingly normal research facility. An unknown person or persons steal a futuristic looking case of vials containing some sort of top secret green and blue substance. Before leaving they smash one of the blue vials and the substance inside is spread throughout the rest of the building through the ventilation system with horrifying results! A beautiful woman (Milla Jovovich, her characters name is never mentioned but it happens to be Alice so that's what I will call her for the rest of my review) wakes up, lying naked in a shower inside a very posh looking bathroom. Alice has no idea who she is or what she is doing there as she has total memory loss. Alice explores her surroundings, she leaves the bathroom and discovers she is in a large, and seemingly deserted mansion. She sees a note that says Today all your dreams come true. Alice finds some rather fetching clothes, a long sexy red dress and a pair of knee high leather boots. A heavily armed elite squad of soldiers, Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez), Chad Kaplan (Martin Crewes), J.D Salinas (Pasquale Aleardi) plus two more whose names are never mentioned (Torsten Jerabek and Marc Logan-Black) burst in through the windows, hey what was wrong with the doors guys? The one in command (Colin Salmon, like Milla his characters name is never mentioned during the film) seems to know Alice. Along with a mysterious man who claims to be a cop called Matt Addison (Eric Mabius) they all get on-board a train and find yet another survivor named Spence Parks (James Purefoy) who also has memory loss like Alice. They all travel on the train deep underground to the 'Hive'. The soldiers explain that the 'Hive' is located under Racoon City being half a mile underground at it's deepest point. It is a top secret research facility owned and operated by the Umbrella Corp. and houses over 500 scientists, technicians and support staff. The 'Hive' is controlled by 'Red Queen', state of the art artificial intelligence that takes on the holographic appearance of the lead programmers daughter (Michaela Dicker). They say they are there on a search and rescue mission as 'Red Queen' went homicidal and killed everyone inside the 'Hive', to try and find out what happened and to destroy 'Red Queen' if necessary. Things don't go according to plan however. There may be a traitor in the group, and a horde of flesh eating zombie office workers created by the Umbrella Corp. developed 'T-Virus' which is what all the fuss is about doesn't help their cause. Nor does the fact that in an hour the 'Hive' will be sealed, permanently with them still inside to stop any potential outside contamination! Will they all make it out in time? Can they put an end to the Umbrella Corp. research and deadly 'T-Virus' it has created and contain it so not to let it spread outside and infect millions of people? Written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson I think playing the game is ultimately more fun and rewarding. All the best ideas in this are taken from the game, the rest come from Aliens (1986) which this film resembles strongly. The script, to it's credit, moves along like a rocket and tries to add some twists here and there but for the most part they are fairly easy to see coming and not surprising. At least it's never dull or boring. I found the horror elements extremely disappointing, the zombies don't turn up until over half way through the film and there is virtually no blood or gore in it at all, apart from a CGI decapitation with no blood. I did like the skinless dogs, but they were taken directly from the game though. As was the big monster at the end which was also quite cool, if a little fake looking. A decent amount of gore would have helped this film no end, the potential was there with zombies Vs heavily armed soldiers but no, just a few bullet hits and that's it. The zombies don't eat anyone either. The action elements are also average at best, a few CGI enhanced fights and a couple of sequences that try to be exciting but generally aren't. I would have preferred the filmmakers to have more of it set in the Gothic cool looking mansion rather than the high-tech labs and offices as it would have given the whole film a much creepier atmosphere. Acting is OK for this type of thing but no-one is going to win an Oscar, and Milla Jovovich is a real babe in that dress and those boots as she kicks but. Everyone else involved has to deal with standard horror stereotypes and clichés. It's not a bad film I suppose as it's well made moves along a nice pace and entertains to an extent but it could have been so much more in the hands of someone with talent and imagination. Resident Evil plays like a cross between the game and Aliens, if the sound of that appeals to you you may like it otherwise you probably won't. Average, but worth a watch none the less.

","genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"18 January 2005","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" We start with some opening narration (by Jason Isaacs) that goes something like this, 'Confidential Report. Subject the events leading up to the incident at Racoon City'. The narration continues, 'At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the Umbrella corporation had become the largest commercial entity in the United States. 9 out of every 10 homes contain it's products. It's political and financial influence is felt everywhere. In public it is the worlds leading supplier of computer technology, medical products, health-care. Unknown even to it's own employees it's massive profits are generated by military technology, genetic experimentation, viral weaponry'. The film then cuts to a seemingly normal research facility. An unknown person or persons steal a futuristic looking case of vials containing some sort of top secret green and blue substance. Before leaving they smash one of the blue vials and the substance inside is spread throughout the rest of the building through the ventilation system with horrifying results! A beautiful woman (Milla Jovovich, her characters name is never mentioned but it happens to be Alice so that's what I will call her for the rest of my review) wakes up, lying naked in a shower inside a very posh looking bathroom. Alice has no idea who she is or what she is doing there as she has total memory loss. Alice explores her surroundings, she leaves the bathroom and discovers she is in a large, and seemingly deserted mansion. She sees a note that says Today all your dreams come true. Alice finds some rather fetching clothes, a long sexy red dress and a pair of knee high leather boots. A heavily armed elite squad of soldiers, Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez), Chad Kaplan (Martin Crewes), J.D Salinas (Pasquale Aleardi) plus two more whose names are never mentioned (Torsten Jerabek and Marc Logan-Black) burst in through the windows, hey what was wrong with the doors guys? The one in command (Colin Salmon, like Milla his characters name is never mentioned during the film) seems to know Alice. Along with a mysterious man who claims to be a cop called Matt Addison (Eric Mabius) they all get on-board a train and find yet another survivor named Spence Parks (James Purefoy) who also has memory loss like Alice. They all travel on the train deep underground to the 'Hive'. The soldiers explain that the 'Hive' is located under Racoon City being half a mile underground at it's deepest point. It is a top secret research facility owned and operated by the Umbrella Corp. and houses over 500 scientists, technicians and support staff. The 'Hive' is controlled by 'Red Queen', state of the art artificial intelligence that takes on the holographic appearance of the lead programmers daughter (Michaela Dicker). They say they are there on a search and rescue mission as 'Red Queen' went homicidal and killed everyone inside the 'Hive', to try and find out what happened and to destroy 'Red Queen' if necessary. Things don't go according to plan however. There may be a traitor in the group, and a horde of flesh eating zombie office workers created by the Umbrella Corp. developed 'T-Virus' which is what all the fuss is about doesn't help their cause. Nor does the fact that in an hour the 'Hive' will be sealed, permanently with them still inside to stop any potential outside contamination! Will they all make it out in time? Can they put an end to the Umbrella Corp. research and deadly 'T-Virus' it has created and contain it so not to let it spread outside and infect millions of people? Written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson I think playing the game is ultimately more fun and rewarding. All the best ideas in this are taken from the game, the rest come from Aliens (1986) which this film resembles strongly. The script, to it's credit, moves along like a rocket and tries to add some twists here and there but for the most part they are fairly easy to see coming and not surprising. At least it's never dull or boring. I found the horror elements extremely disappointing, the zombies don't turn up until over half way through the film and there is virtually no blood or gore in it at all, apart from a CGI decapitation with no blood. I did like the skinless dogs, but they were taken directly from the game though. As was the big monster at the end which was also quite cool, if a little fake looking.

The latter NIGHTMARE films bogged down into such complete silliness, it was almost mind boggling. It's obvious Newline knew that by this point the series had nowhere else to go & was merely coasting by on fumes, because there was no way they'd make a film this silly if they had ever planned on continuing this character in any more films. The previous Nightmare sequels had many silly moments, but nowhere near as much as we got here. Worth noting is how the numbers on the elm street house say 1427 elm street, when it should read 1428 & despite being closed up for many years, the Elm street house still has power! ROBERT ENGLUND is still fun to watch, but I think even he knew the series days were numbered, you can see it in his performance. The film chucks out many themes & rules made in the previous films between fantasy & reality as well. RACHEL TALALY who worked on many of the previous NIGHTMARE movies, has no talent at all when it comes to direction. Her direction is all over the place & it's no surprise that along with this & TANK GIRL & GHOST IN THE MACHINE, she disappeared from the feature film world. She approaches the material like she's making a cartoon & as a result many things that could have made for an intriguing & perhaps better instalment in the franchise winds up way to hammy to take seriously. The film touches upon many themes, not explored previously, such as incest, child abuse etc. but while these could have been intriguing avenues to explore for the series, the sad fact is, this to is handled with a campy & downright silly attitude that completely sinks it & the special effects aren't up to series par. Billed as the final instalment what started out as a truly terrifying series of horror films, with genuine suspense & terror & tension & a truly terrifying villain was sadly & crudely abandon as the series went on & this fact was none the more evident than it was here, I never cared for the fact that Freddy was married & had a daughter, somehow this made him even less scarier. I always thought he was much more scarier when one assumed he was just a loner his whole life. The level of bad puns, jokes & silliness abounded. The teen characters were none to likable & the 3D effects weren't very well done either. Some of the kills were also on the silly side including one character falling asleep & dreaming he is trapped in a video game with his overbearing father. Freddy who is in complete control of the youth's actions in the dream & game world, thanks to his power glove (don't ask) which he uses to cause the teen to bounce up & done & punch through walls like Super Mario & another kids head explodes when Freddy gives him a super sensitive hearing aid! whats more, Freddy never uses his razor fingered glove to kill anyone & a couple of the other kills seen in the film is played for laughs! Speaking of the body count, it's low with the kills being unimaginative & as already mentioned, silly. The film sets up a number of good cameo's though in funny bit parts, ROSANNE & TOM ARNOLD as residents of Springwood, who's children were killed by Freddy. ALICE COOPER as Freddy's abusive alcoholic step dad, that winds up as one of Freddy's first victims when Freddy was a disturbed (& I do mean disturbed!) teen. JOHNNY DEPP returning from the original in a funny Anti-drug commercial made by Freddy etc. & the characters were more interesting & fleshed out than they were in previous instalments & I liked the idea of Freddy's victims being erased from everyone's memories, with the exception of his daughter, her friend a psychiatrist working at the youth centre & a troubled teen who got caught up in the supernatural going on's. All in all FREDDY'S DEAD THE FINAL NIGHTMARE, has many amusing moments & the film tends to explore much of Freddy's past than any of the prior sequels did & even gives us a reason why Freddy keeps coming back (he has three powerful dream demons inside him that has given him eternal powers) & how he now has the powers to spread his evil world wide after killing off the last elm street kid of the parents who torched him, who themselves have lost their minds, acting childlike & seeing imaginary kids all around them in Springwood which has no more children left. But as stated it's not scary & is to dumb to be funny. It's better than Part 5, but sadly not by much, in fact if I were to name this sequel anything, I would name it as a guilty pleasure.

From very good and solid scenes to some elements that are pure garbage. It's very up and down you might say. There are two things that i found very disturbing about this movie. First of all the ending (or rather the resolution), which i won't discuss in detail since it would mean spoilers. But one thing to think about is this if you were an omnipotent being, how hard would it be for you to force your way through a wooden door?! The second thing is Mel Gibson. I don't know what it is about that man. Sometimes he can be great, and sometimes he degrades his acting talent to the level of Christopher Lambert! His attempts at emotional displays here are pathetic to say the least.With that said this movie has a few strong points that makes it worth watching nevertheless. First of all the almost patented atmosphere of suspense that Shyamalan always manages to create. The effective mood of something bad about to happen. Also the story works pretty well despite some flaws. What i also appreciate is the rather quirky sense of humor that Shyamalan displays in this movie. Some people have interpreted this as the director making fun of his own movie. But rather i see it as his way of not making the movie grave and serious to the point where everything becomes silly.So, i recommend this to fans of Shyamalan and fans of suspenseful thrillers.

The second time around, the idea that materialism and consumerism were taking over people's lives and causing impaired judgment just blew me away. I began to think in Fight Club terms. ...an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars.

Stan Lee created Spider-Man, who is awesome. And then Stan Lee had a love-child with Sam Raimi - it was the long awaited 'Spider-Man' movie, and it was awesome. Sometimes even I don't understand what I'm talking about.Growing up, I was a fan of the 'Spider-Man' cartoon that ran from 1994 to 1998. It was awesome. I never really collected the comics, I read the occasional one, and I still do, and the games on Super Nintendo were fun. One day, I picked up a Spider-Man comic, and at the end was a page from 'The Daily Bugle', announcing that 10 years of legal battles were over. A 'Spider-Man' movie would be made. I was so happy, that my head nearly exploded with happiness. Thankfully, any head explosions were avoided. I still don't quite understand what I'm talking about.Onto the movie. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a science-geek who doesn't fit in at school, and whose only friend is Harry Osborne (James Franco), the son Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe), a scientist and head-honcho of his own company. On a field trip (to genetics laboratory of all places), Peter is bitten by a spider (a genetically enhanced 'super-spider' no less). Naturally, instead of any negative side-effects, Peter finds he now possesses spider-like powers. Meanwhile, on the evil side of town, Norman Osborne is working on a chemical human performance enhancer. With the threat of his funding being pulled, Norman tests the prototype out himself, and it works perfectly, save for him going rather insane. With a super-hero in town and no super-villains in sight, Norman dubs himself 'the Green Goblin' and runs off to cause some chaos.Any movie based on a comic is going to have mess around with the facts of the comic, the story, characters, order of events can't stay exactly the same. 'Spider-Man' is no different, but the core is the same. The reason for Peter Parker to be Spider-Man is there, the original moral of 'Spider-Man' is maintained throughout the whole movie - with great power comes great responsibility. It was good to see the message was still there. Don't discredit it either, I can think of various examples where this message can be applied to the real world (American foreign policy, for instance).The acting is the strongest point movie. Tobey Maguire does the whole geeky Peter \/ uber-cool Spider-Man thing so well. If I said to Randy Savage, a pro-wrestler and rapper, what Spidey did, I'd probably be killed straight away. Willem Dafoe is great as the insane Green Goblin, ditto Rosemary Harris as Aunt May. Better yet, was J.K. Simmons who seemed to be J. Jonah Jameson to a tee, and Jameson is cool. Speaking of cool, Bruce Campbell has a cameo. It might not be as Ash, but its still the King, baby. Bruce Campbell is awesome. I'm not even talking about the movie anymore, am I? Unfortunately, the action scenes are the only real down point of the movie. Most of them very heavy on not-so-good CGI effects. I'm probably being a little unfair, as I think nearly all CGI effects are poor. That being said, I still enjoyed Spider-Man's showdown with the Green Goblin.

Amelie is a real feel-good film, though not in the stereotypical Hollywood style. Its full of mystery, humour, and moments that make you think 'I wish I'd thought of that!' - for example, the way she sends Nico on a wild-goose-chase in the park at the Montmartre carousel. Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Amelie, a simple girl on the surface but with astonishing inventiveness, bewildering all around her.As a director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet has a unique style. He seems to make great use of colour - some would say to unnecessary extremes, but for me it gives the film a sunshiny feel, whatever the weather in the film. He also likes to zoom about with his camera's, but again this all adds to the way the film completely draws you into its own world, just as Amelie draws Nico into her world without them actually really meeting. A few nice special effects top it off, and there are a few little details that you probably won't see the first couple of times you watch it.I'm no film expert, but I loved this film, its my favourite of all time (so far, anyway), and I'm in danger of wearing out my DVD. There are some people who don't see what all the fuss is about for them it's too sickly-sweet, or they see Amelie as a meddler or nosy-parker, but I think they've just somehow missed the essence of the film, poor things ;) Don't read too many detailed reviews before watching it, or you could spoil the surprises.

There are some people who don't see what all the fuss is about for them it's too sickly-sweet, or they see Amelie as a meddler or nosy-parker, but I think they've just somehow missed the essence of the film, poor things ;) Don't read too many detailed reviews before watching it, or you could spoil the surprises.

To promote himself, he lends out his apartment to his superiors so they can have extramarital affairs. Things get complicated when he falls in love with Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), the mistress of his boss, JD Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray).I first saw The Apartment when I was 17 years old. I instantly liked it, but it would never have occurred to me to label it my favourite film. It isn't cinematic ally dazzling. It doesn't feature any of my favourite actors. It doesn't push the boundaries of what's acceptable in film. Yet over the next thirteen years, I kept getting drawn back to it- because I could see the parallels that it had with my own life. This is a story about priorities and the bittersweet nature of relationships that I found to be haunting. Not bad for a comedy.The best way to see this movie is a letterboxed DVD. It captures the intimacy of the characters better than the cinema experience and the loneliness of the spaces surrounding them better than a pan and scan version.Jack Lemmon was a theatrically trained actor who gave his all and took quite a few critical hits for it (and praise too; he won several acting prizes). The Apartment contains most of his finest work as Wilder keeps him under firm control. Lemmon finds the right tone and understands the material perfectly. In interviews, he remarked of the ending Billy threw a rose into a garbage pail. C.C. Baxter is an engaging character, although he can be a little overbearing at times. Lemmon is at his best in the quieter moments- that perfect stone face he projects as he says I said I had no family. I didn't say I had an empty apartment. At times, he doesn't seem to be in control of his own body- witness him dancing around like somebody else is pulling the strings.Shirley MacLaine is wonderful as Fran. She stays totally focused on the person she's talking to and delivers her dialogue sharply. You get a real sense of loss when Fran attempts suicide, because you don't pity her. MacLaine is totally unsentimental here- it's more an attempt to get somebody's attention than self-annihilation.Fred MacMurray's best two film roles were for Wilder (this and Double Indemnity (1944)) and the director uses him for maximum effect. Probably the most sordid scene in the film is family Christmas scene as Sheldrake's son opens his presents and has just discovered the word profligate- it's very subversive watching the all-American dad being a philanderer and a liar. MacMurray embodies everyday, uncaring, ordinary meanness here. You can see the charm and power that makes him attractive to women like Fran. You can also see the transparent snake-oil salesmanship that alienates him from people who know better and don't have to be nice to him.What I love about Billy Wilder's films (and this one in particular) is the fact that you don't have to make any allowances for him. More than any other director of his era, Wilder deals with the basic elements of humanity and these never date. Although The Apartment is a film very much of its time in its setting (Sheldrake getting his shoe shined by a black man) and references (a secretary complains that she can't rendezvous with her boss because The Untouchables is on TV that night), it seems more modern than ever. I can't think of another film that depicts life choices as realistically and as entertainingly as this one does. I've related to this film in so many ways. I've often been too eager to please and unsure whether people like me or what I do for them. I've had a crush on a co-worker who didn't return my affections. I'm often helping out damaged women. I think the movie captures the bittersweet nature of life perfectly.I revisit The Apartment once a year. Watching it is like revisiting an old friend who sets you straight. This isn't a film for everyone (despite winning a Best Picture Oscar)- it often leaves a sour aftertaste to people who may find some elements objectionable. Yet it fits in with my jaundiced but romantically hopeful view of life and that's why it's my favourite movie.

I have seen this movie numerous times and never tire of its entertaining qualities.OK, so the film is probably not as clever as it thinks it is, but it is certainly not shallow or predictable (as suggested in many comments posted here) and YES it is thought provoking (otherwise why have so many people who claim that it isn't, got so much to say about it.) I do however agree that the ending is contrived, it deliberately withholds vital information (18 Hours of Static) to show that Jodie Foster has learnt to have 'Faith', this was unnecessary.Having read many of the reviews here on IMDb the theme of the reviews seems to revolve far too much around the religious undertones and the battle between faith and science too often. Yes, this would seem to be highly relevant, as it is a strong theme throughout the movie, however this alone is probably not a good enough reason to either love or hate this film. For a start most of the arguments are flawed and some are comically inaccurate, (example 1 - Jodie Foster says she can't believe in god, as there is no data to either support of disprove such a belief, Palmer then asks her to prove she loved her Dad.) Now, i ask you, is belief an emotion? No. So how does this comparison have any rational argument against her failure to believe in God? (example 2 - Jodie Foster says that if the message was religious, then it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a big booming voice from the sky, and Palmer states that that's exactly what it was.) So, if a radio signal received from outside our atmosphere, can be interpreted as 'a religious message' does this mean every phone user hears these 'religious messages' all the time? After all these are radio signals that are satellite relayed around the world from outside our atmosphere. Surely, there are better arguments that could have been used.Anyway, all that aside i really enjoyed this film, simply for its entertainment value and its more realistic approach to an alien civilisation and interaction with other lifeforms in the universe.I give it 9\/10, even if it is flawed.
