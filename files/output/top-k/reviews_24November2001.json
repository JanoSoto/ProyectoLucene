I went to this film with a totally objective frame of mind, having not read any of the books or really knowing much about the plot.Once I saw Chris Columbus was directing it, I wondered whether the fantastical elements the film promised would come closer to the great potential he showed when he wrote 'Young Sherlock Holmes' or when he COMPLETELY lost the plot with 'Stepmom'.  Unfortunately, I think the film leans more towards 'Stepmom', though not sentimental it is patchy with little attention to character development.  It was an inspired idea to get Steve Kloves to write the screenplay (who wrote 'Wonder Boys' but the film seemed really compromised.I can see through the ideas that JK Rowling must have put in the book- what an imagination she must have, you can see that readers would be totally transfixed.  But it didn't translate well, despite the 11-year old I took with me who said it was just how he pictured it was.  In a way, I guess that is where the film succeeded, it's fans weren't disappointed by what they saw, but this is also the problem, because what must have worked well enough in the book to make it such a success seems stilted and full of obvious CGI effects to distract from what is happening.  The movie seemed like a series of marvelous set pieces all executed really quickly.  It delved right into the story without much notice to time or place.  Nothing was left to the imagination- the first-year students see the paintings moving in the hall, a nice background effect, and it must be pointed out, 'Look, the pictures are moving!'  Harry, Ron and Hermoine climb some stairs which starts to move 'Look, the stairs are moving, don't you remember, the stairs move!'  What do the filmmakers take the audience for, idiots?  I found the preview for Lord of the Rings more enchanting than the film, because it seemed really special, magical, scary and uncompromising.  Only time will tell if this is the case.The casting was very uneven.  Ron Weasley was the only one of the three kids who had any real acting skill, Harry and Hermoine were so bland, very one-note actors.

It would have been more interesting to cast unknowns who look more like what is described in the book, not cameos for the sake of it.  Maybe the fact it was backed, adapted and directed by Americans made them feel obligated to cast known actors to make it seem more like a genuine British film?What was REALLY shocking was the stereotyping.  Why do the scary characters all have cockney accents, and what was the story with the bankers who looked coincidentally like the Jews as portrayed in Nazi propaganda films?

There were no kiddies in the movie, only adults, a sleeping child, and some teenage girls.  This movie is really a fantasy that adults will enjoy.  First, the cast is all British and Irish.  It is good that American actors were not considered for this film.  Because, we Yanks would not know how to properly act with that British-aire!  It's a good thing we speak the same language because it would be difficult to follow along in English subtitles!  Wonder how the rest of the world is truly understanding this film with subtitles or voice overs in the local language?Anyway, you don't have to have read any of the Harry Potter books to enjoy this film.  And, maybe that's a good thing.  I wasn't interested in a fantasy story of some 11 - 12 year old children to have read any of the books.  But, as a movie, it does make for a good story.I won't bother telling the story or commenting on some of the tricks of the trade.  My only real criticism is that I had difficulty understanding some of the dialog of the young child actors due to their soft spoken diction and my lack of familiarity with certain spoken phrases and styles of British speech.  Also, as Yanks, many of us don't meet people sporting these uniquely British surnames.  It was only when I saw the cast list on www.IMDB.com that I could understand these characters' last names.12-year old Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), his 11-year old friend-girl Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and his friend-boy Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint - age not listed in IMDB) are people with magical powers. They are recruited into the freshman class (6th grade?) at an Oxford-style University of Wizard Training!  Remember, it is the British lifestyle that this book\/film depicts.  Like Oxford, a school composed of a number of distinct colleges, the Wizard U has four different houses or colleges where the wizards in training are placed according to some inner wizardry ability.  You see this school rivalry by the different colors of scarfs, banners, and neckties the children wear.  In the beginning of the movie, we have a sort of borrowed Cinderella story.  Harry Potter, an orphan, is living with his wicked stepparents and wicked cousin until he grows up enough to enter the Hogwart's Wizard School!  One wants to smack mean-wicked Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths) and Aunt Petunia Dursley (Fiona Shaw) as well as cousin Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling) for their meanness to young Harry Potter.  Young Melling acts like Augustus Gloop the overeater and piggy from Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  He gets his in the end.Veteran performances by 71 year old Irish actor Richard Harris as the Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (see what I said about British names?) and 67 year old Dame Maggie Smith as Professor\/Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall were a pleasure to view.  This proves that there are good roles for older career seasoned actors\/actresses.55 year old Alan Rickman has great facial expressions and one look from him and you feel you are guilty of some long lost childhood prank just discovered. Mr. Rickman should have had an expanded role and more speaking lines.  51 year old Robbie Coltrane plays a major role as the Gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid.  One will like the Hogwart's schools traditional sports rivalry in the form of a cricket style match with young wizards flying full speed on enchanted witches brooms!  One wanted to laugh when Harry Potter receives a gift of a Nimbus 2000 Model super-flying broom!  Why don't the other kids in this college have one like it?  A bit of a sticky wicket, ay?There are lots of computer-generated graphic interfaces in this film.  And, it helps to tell the story.  I enjoyed the travel back in time to maybe 18th Century England where Hagrid takes Harry to purchase his special wizard school supplies.  Humm, all the characters here are wizards and Harry begins to learn that he is famous and expected.Later into the film, we have what is reminiscent of the quest as in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  What kinds of powers do ruby-red stones have, anyway?  I suppose, that in subsequent films, and as Harry and his friendship group grows a little older, we will find them involved in more enchanted adventures.  If the entire cast remains and grows up in this genre, then a little romance between Harry and Hermione is needed.  A little innocent hand holding and a few kisses would help the interaction between these two characters. Remember The Wonder Years? So, if you want to finally see a new movie where you won't second-guess the next scenes, then, see Harry Potter.  Forget about reading the books if you have not done so and just enjoy the next six films that may ensue over the next dozen or so years to come.  Maybe this will become a Thanksgiving tradition.Forget all the talk-hype about anti-religion, witches, black magic, etc.  This is a NO HARM fantasy movie.  The Devil is not going to invade one's household.  Just think about Samantha Stevens from Bewitched for all those years we watched her on TV and in reruns.  This movie is that innocent.  Good triumphs over evil.  Whether you are a wizard or a mortal!OK, so I told a bit of the story.  Anyway, it's a 9 and Two-Thumbs Up!

He sure has put up with a lot of criticism over the past few years, but he's a good sport, and if anything proves that, it's Driven.I missed this flick in the theaters, and just now caught up with it on DVD. I was well aware of the bad rep this movie has, and I was the most eager to see what the big fuss was. You have Stallone, a seasoned action star in a film helmed by Renny (Cliffhanger, Deep Blue Sea) Harlin. Could it really be that bad?The answer is no. In fact, I found myself getting into the film in many scenes. Unfortunately, the race scenes were the only ones. The race scenes are, in a word, stunning. The effects do go a bit overboard at times, but overall they are loud, well-shot, and most importantly, exciting.What is so questionable here is the screenplay. Sly wrote the whole shebang, and it shows. These are some of the most paper-thin characters I have ever seen onscreen.

So here's my two bits.  bloody Americans can't shut up, can they?!  As you can see in the title, I believed that the film was indeed a noble attempt. As a fan with far too much Harry Potter trivia ingrained in my grey matter, and oddly enough, looking like an adult HP, I am the worst possible movie goer for this film a picky and obsessed fanatic.  My comments on the details  Harry has GREEN eyes.  I really missed that detail.  And the Dursleys were far too kind.  They were over-the-top in the book, which added to the satirical humor that makes Rowling's books so enjoyable.  I did agree with the cutting of the Norbert scene it was a small detail touched in later books, but is unimportant in the storytelling.  I wish that there was more interaction with the twins.  I did see them as a bit more muscular, but they were adorable, so I forgave.  And Captain Oliver .. WOOF!  'nuff said.  But enough of that.The story overall was very faithful.  The film lagged only when changes were made.  The Quiddich game was a spectacular treat, BUT it was a bit over the top.  Shades of Home Alone, of course.  But I can forgive that, because it was a spectacular event.  The attacking keys were a bit much for me in the end.. more Home Alone.  Harry was a bit too mean in the beginning.  Part of the joy of the Harry Potter is that it is a coming of age story.  He begins as a quiet, weak little boy, thrust into a world of magic.  And misconceptions are given of the Dursleys.  Duddley-wudkins jumping on the staircase forcing Harry to join them for his birthday?  The hatred between them wasn't as clear as it could have been.  Malfoy was well done, though a distinct sexual desire\/tension could be felt.  Interesting.  Emma Watson shines as Hermione Granger.  Though she looks a bit too pretty in my mind.

The original film had two strong elements going for it  its expansive visual style and its playful spirit.  Both qualities have been effectively eliminated in Tim Burton's update, along with the sense of wonder that came, thirty-three years ago, when the material was still innovative and fresh.  What viewer can forget the time he first saw that stunning final shot of the earlier version, with a weary Charlton Heston coming upon the remains of the Statue of Liberty - then bellowing in outrage at the tragic reality hitherto unrevealed to both him and us?  Burton, not wanting to be a slavish devotee to the original (and not wanting the audience to know everything about the story in advance of entering the theatre), attempts a similar `surprise' ending here, but the execution of it is so ludicrous, confused and clumsy that all one can do is scratch one's head and giggle in bemused befuddlement.Much of the effectiveness of the original `Planet of the Apes' lay in its deliberately paced buildup.  The early stretches of the film, in which Heston and his fellow astronauts wandered the desert in search of life, helped immensely in generating an atmosphere of suspense and mystery.  In the new version, however, the lone hero, Thade (Mark Wahlberg), crash lands on the planet and, almost instantaneously, finds himself caught in this strange world in which evolution seems to have taken a reverse course, where apes speak and have dominion over docile humans - though they're not quite as docile as they were in the first version since in this edition the humans speak, rendering absurd the idea that the apes would consider humans to be a subspecies.   Also, in the original version, much of the time was spent focusing on Heston's attempts to convince the apes that he was every bit as smart as they were.  Thus, much of the pleasure of the film came from the fact that there seemed to be a duel of wits going on between apes and humans &#150; a contest that often took the form of high-spirited, clever and even witty dialogue exchanges.  For all the ludicrousness of its premise, the original `Planet of the Apes' was not a DUMB movie.  I wish one could say the same for the remake.  The plotting in this version essentially boils down to little more than an extended and distended chase story, with apes racing madly after humans from one dimly lit locale to the next. And here we come upon another problem with the movie &#150; one it shares with many modern action flicks, actually, especially those made by Burton.  It is simply shot too dark.  One of the qualities that distinguished the original film from most of the sci-fi adventure films that came before it was the near-epic feeling created by its beautiful wide screen images of the desert setting.  These shots lent a visual impressiveness to the potentially childish material and helped to bring an aura of seriousness to the proceedings.  In Burton's version, however, the visual style is often dark, cramped and confining, not at all conducive to the sense of majesty and awe that Franklin Schaffner's version afforded.Wahlberg is a bland substitute for Heston who, dressed only in a loincloth and hissing virtually every line through clenched teeth, seemed to sense the camp potential hidden beneath the story's surface &#150; a fact not acknowledged by the stolid Wahlberg (or by Burton for that matter).  How we miss the charming personalities of Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter as the sympathetic ape characters.  Poor Helena Bonham Carter, in the Hunter role, doesn't get to recite even one vaguely amusing line.  It seems amazing that a movie made thirty-three years ago would take itself so much less seriously than a film made today.  One would expect that a filmmaker like Burton, known for his ability to find humor in the most macabre of situations, would be the last director to take such a humorless, deadpan approach to material like this.   The original `Planet of the Apes' managed to combine the elements of originality, suspense, humor, irony, surprise and visual acuity to create a work of lasting value and interest.

When the woman emerged from the water after the car wreck with that bizarre stare on her face, I sensed almost immediately what the twist was gonna be, & I saw it before all the recent movies about people not knowing they're dead.  But I thought Well if they all drowned in the car then all their ghosts should be appearing & since it's just the one, maybe she did miraculously get out of the car somehow, so let's see.  Then followed a series of bland scenes with stilted dialogue.  It didn't seem like real life at all; real people're a lot more animated than that.  I did like the woman's general indifference to other people, especially the cardboard would-be Lothario, that was kinda unusal for the time, although I would've liked it better without this back-of-my-mind suspicion that I knew the real reason for it (see above).  The best scenes were when she would periodically become unseen & unheard by others, there was a great naturalistic creepiness achieved there.  But as soon as the white-faced guy made his appearance, it was pretty much over for me.  Couldn't take it seriously after that.  The speeded-up action of the ghosts was like an old silent movie & I guess the director got the effect he wanted, but it had nothing to do with what had been developed previously, it was as though he just replaced one movie with another.  Then it was just a matter of waiting for the final scene that even in 1962 everyone must've known was coming & that clearly had been borrowed from the final shot in Psycho a few years previously.  But I agree there was great location work & effective cinematography, although with that old black-&-white film stock it was hard to go wrong. They don't make that film stock any more & black-&-white movies today look like crap, in my view.  But bottom line I don't hate Carnival of Souls, it was worth a look, I just can't accept it as some long-lost gem, unless one wants to compare it with tons of shlock in about the same cost-range, but again, I don't care what a movie cost to make.   This movie reminds me somewhat of The Blair Witch Project, another low-budget cult favorite that I think gets better in the memory the longer ago one saw it & that also featured long boring stretches with a few effective moments.  I mean hey, it's very commendable to want to cut a cheaply made flick lots of slack, part of our whole modern PC culture of constantly levelling playing fields, but consider this if Souls' director had had the dough to give it a professional-studio look, would anyone care about it now?  Wasn't its whole virtue kinda born of necessity?   Jump ahead a few years did Night of the Living Dead become a classic because it also was cheaply made? or rather because of the warped genius of George Romero?
