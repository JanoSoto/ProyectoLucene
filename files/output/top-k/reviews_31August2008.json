The movie follows the life of a gambler who's cleaned up his act after losing his bankroll to a Russian mobster. After 2 years of playing safe Worm(Norton) is released from jail and Mikes turns back into the gambler he always was.The movies really fun mostly do to the great lines and chemistry between Norton and Damon. The finale is well worth it this movie may go down as a box office flop but its very underrated and very very enjoyable I rate this movie 9.5 out of 10 mostly due to how the movie dropped the character worm without much closer with him in the end ","genre":null},{"date":"31 August 2008","score":"","review":" Rounders is a very good movie.
