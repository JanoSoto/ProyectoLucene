I personally find Brad Pitt and George Clooney to be among the most watchable actors working today, so I found the movie to be hugely appealing despite numerous plot holes, an almost nonstop barrage of clichés, a ridiculous ending, and Don Cheadle. Before I go on, I should mention that I think Cheadle is an immensely talented actor with some great performance's under his belt, such as his work in Boogie Nights, Traffic, and A Lesson Before Dying (sure, he can't pronounce Vladivostok, but it was still a great performance). The problem with his character here, probably the most controversial role of the entire movie, is that he was forced to take on this ridiculous accent, making him the Jar Jar Binks of Ocean's 11. Pretty sad, but I hope it serves as a lesson for how dumb it is to have well known actors take on thick accents. It does nothing but call attention to itself and invite criticism for the actor's ability to pull it off. And given the content of the discussion boards on the IMDb, Cheadle didn't pull it off so well. That being said, the rest of the movie is enormously entertaining, even though Andy Garcia, who I have had an unjustifiable aversion to ever since Desperate Measures, turns his character of the ridiculously rich Terry Benedict, owner of three casinos in Las Vegas, into an almost cartoonish villain. George Clooney plays the title character Danny Ocean, recently released from prison where he had plenty of time to develop intricate plots for robbing three casinos simultaneously. The parole board asks him if he thinks he would ever return to a life of crime were he released, he smiles, gets released, and promptly returns to a life of crime. This is the kind of character that Clooney was born to play.Brad Pitt plays Ocean's Second, the second man in charge and much of the pull behind getting this whole thing together. We get the usual montage of hilarious antics being committed by those that are to be sought to be among Ocean's 11 (edited together on the same template used to introduce us to the colorful characters in Armageddon), each one fulfilling the need for another stereotype. In this way, the movie is pretty weak, but it is so entertaining to watch the robberies pulled off that it makes up for a lot of these shortcomings. Brad Pitt lends his massive presence to the film as Rusty, an old friend of Danny's. Rusty is an interesting character, sort of a freelancer in Vegas, living his life in the casinos, obviously raking in comfortable amounts of cash from his less than legal endeavors, and willing only to dress in the highest of fashion. Strange, however, for a man to constantly wear such high priced clothing when he is ALWAYS eating. Matt Damon plays the part of the pickpocket, whose skills come into good use in the plot in ways which I will not reveal, Don Cheadle plays the demolitions expert, Bernie Mac gets a great role as a card dealer with a not so clean past, and Elliott Gould makes a huge turn from his character in American History X to play the part of a washed up con man, eager for revenge against Terry Benedict, who put him out of business.The idea is to rob the central safe that stores the cash for the three casinos in question. Supposedly this is the most ingenious and impenetrable vault ever created by mankind (as this is generally how it is described throughout the movie), which begs the question of why the blueprints for the vault are kept under the watchful eye of a cheaply rented night security guard. That's like leaving the keys to Fort Knox in plain view outside the vault and protected by a thin pane of glass. (spoilers) Complicating matters, conveniently for the script, is the little factoid that Benedict is now dating Ocean's ex-wife, who left him because he was involved in a life of crime. It's interesting to see the movie take place in what is to me the familiar setting of Las Vegas, but it is not enough to distract attention from the disastrous romantic content of the movie.Not only does Tess (Roberts) come off as a stiff and exceedingly unpleasant woman, but she left Danny in the first place for being a criminal and landing himself in prison. Then he pulls off this astronomical heist, stealing millions and millions of dollars from her current love interest (as well as managing to get him to admit on camera that he cares more about money than he does about Tess), and THEN she wants him back. What, she didn't want to be with him before because his criminal life landed him in prison, but now she wants him back because he's GOOD at being a criminal? Please. Nevertheless, while the ending almost completely ruined the movie because it leaves such a bad aftertaste, the rest of the film is hugely entertaining, bad fake accents notwithstanding. There are lots of twists and turns, lots of people get what is coming to them, and as is to be expected from a movie starring Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon and Julia Roberts, the star power is substantial. It ends badly, but it's great up to that point. It's just too bad that the bad part is so near the end and therefore in the front of your mind at the end of the movie.

The movie also contains a deeper message, concerning the cruelty of war and the value of the human life. Although the small-budget film-making, like in the two previous movies of the dollars-trilogy, has its own attraction, director Sergio Leone really shows what he's made of this time. There are some epic war scenes, huge explosions and realistic sets, that Leone no doubt could have been able to make with the minimal budget of A Fistful of Dollars.The movie is set sometime in the American Civil War. As before, Clint Eastwood stars. He's the man with no name, which is this time named Blondie. He still doesn't talk very much and he'll still do anything for a fistful of dollars. Although he's namely the Good he's not really a hero you can look up to. In fact he's only the least bad of the three main characters, who are all greedy and ruthless men, who are prepared to kill anyone who stands in their way. The Ugly is Blondie's best friend, partner in crime and also the worst enemy. He's the Mexican bandit named Tuco. Eli Wallach is wonderful as Tuco, he almost steals the show from Clint, being a cruel, stupid, vengeful, greedy, two-faced, but somehow also a very lovable character. The same can't be said about the Bad, the assassin Angel Eyes, who is played by the greatest of western crooks, Lee van Cleef. He's a ruthless man, who'll not only kill a wanted man, but also his family and take their money when he only needed to get was one name. When he gets paid, he'll kill his employer, because he reckons, the previous body wanted to hire him to do so. Angel Eyes also works as a deputy leader of a southern POW camp. He's almost the complete opposite of Col. Mortimer from A Few Dollars More. They are on different sides of the war, but the southern colonel is a much more honorable man.The movie contains an anti-war message. Although the Civil War only seems to be the set-up for the gold hunt which covers the movie's plot, war is criticized all the time. The POW camp could as well be a concentration camp, as prisoners get beaten near death as the choir is forced to sing, so the voices of the beating couldn't be heard. You are put to the camp for simply rooting for the wrong side. Also watching a big fight at the river, the usually very little-talking Blondie notes that he's never seen men wasted so badly. Later he even gives his coat and cigar to a dying soldier. He seems to be the only character in the movie capable of some sort of empathy. Who would've thought!The modern action film directors should take a good look at the Good, the Bad and the Ugly (some do, but to no avail). At least many movie villains should remember Tuco's unforgettable line When you got to shoot, shoot, don't talk!***** (10\/10 The top ten movies I've seen #4)The best part (Major SPOILER) Many to choose from, but there's never been a dual scene quite like the one at the cemetery in the end. While Ennio Morricone's wonderful music plays, the camera goes around to show us the whole scenery and Tuco's and Angel Eyes's emotions (Blondie is so calm I can't really say the same about him). Tuco is very scared, almost in panic and waits for the tension to trigger off. Angel Eyes, however is bubbling with hatred and greed. Blondie is still squinting calmly as ever.

I even saw some person complaining that some people see its better than The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and other instant classics. The problem with these people is that their mind is too closed to see the difference between these movies and a movie like Memento. Memento was shot on a low budget. This means actors like Pacino, etc etc... can not be cast easily. For Pearce, this is one of his best performances, hands down. Also, Pantoliano and Moss deliver a completely unique perspective on characters in any film. The best part about the two is the constant flip flopping of good and evil within them. You never truly get a grasp on whether one is trying to help or hurt Pearce on his mission. And if its realism that people are complaining about (Lenny's condition mainly), go back and check your own favorites for realism, I'm sure not every part is factual and actually possible. With films in the independent genre of film, it is important to keep an open mind, and see what the director and writer(s) have to offer you. The reason they are independent in the first place is to stray from traditional Hollywood production values. Everything the directing, writing, and editing throw into this film has a purpose to the storyline. The performances may not be the best all around (except Pearce), but the story makes up for it. It truly keeps you on your toes and (so cliché in saying this) makes you think but on a different realm. Not only are you trying to piece together what is happening, but why the person in charge of a certain aspect did it that way. That's all I have to say... if you'd like to have an intelligent conversation about movies, I'm game. Drop me an e-mail.

I love the scenes of Santa Cruz and especially liked the bus scene between Ben Affleck, Lhea Remini, and Brendan Frasier. Not only was Brendan dressed like I was back then, but I swear, I think, I had a convo. on the bus with a girlfriend while waiting for the damn train to pass, too. Yeah, every bus ride was an adventure! There is a strong moral in the movie, it's hard to find but it can be gleaned from any college graduate. Freedom from Fear leads to a Fear from Freedom. As for any banana slugs out there, save this movie when your thirty and you'll completely realize why you did what you did, and how Santa Cruz will always be on your mind. That's a good thing I believe, because we lived in a very special place that seems to create amazingly talented and successful people. John Garcia -Class of '95 U.C.

Apparently, he starred in the play which had a years-long run on Broadway. However, this was before my time, and so I was unaware of that until reading it yesterday on IMDb. While a very good movie, it didn't seem to be as good as I remembered it, from seeing it on television in the late Sixties. This more likely reflects on me, rather than the film. William Powell was excellent in the role he came out of retirement to play, and Jimmy Cagney found an excellent role here for him to play in middle age. He chewed the scenery some, but everyone knows that martinet ship captains like that do exist, and are a literary mainstay, reaching back to Wolf Larssen, Ahab, and beyond. Jack Lemmon won an Oscar for his role as Ensign Pulver, and it seems well-deserved to me, though I don't know who the competition was. I haven't seen the film wherein Lemmon reprised this role, but I have not heard good things about it. The ending shouldn't surprise anyone, although it did me, when I saw this as a kid. Still a darned good movie, deserving of a place in anyone's DVD collection, particularly anyone who is fond of the work of any of the four main performers.

Halloween III was not so bad, but a lot of people were understandably put off because it had nothing to do with its predecessors. In this installment, almost everyone is back except for Jamie Lee Curtis, who is replaced as an intended victim surprisingly well by Meyers' niece, Jamie Lloyd, played by ten-year-old Danielle Harris.The movie starts off years after where part II left off (except that Meyers and Dr. Loomis have been brought back to life, having clearly died at the end of part II), and Meyers is finally being transferred out of the guarded hospital where he has been kept catatonic all these years. All of the employees at the hospital are relieved to see him go, because he gives the all the creeps. The situation gives the feeling that Meyers is being kept like some kind of alien that they can't figure out how to kill. Some explanation for why he was ever kept alive in the first place would have been in order, I should think.During the transfer, as is to be expected, Meyers comes alive and kills everyone in the ambulance transferring him. Accident investigators on the scene later, immediately assume everyone is dead despite not being able to find all of the bodies, and illustrate their investigative competence by more than once referring to the ambulance as a bus. What follows is a Halloween installment that is sufficiently dark and gloomy, but that is really not much more than a series of death scenes. The electrocution scene, for example, is so obviously contrived that it could just as easily have been installed just about anywhere in any of the other Halloween films.The film concerns Laurie Strode's niece, Jamie, and Strode's foster sister Rachel, who is, of course, having boy trouble. Her troubles may be a little difficult to understand, however, because not only is the object of her affection amazingly goofy looking, but he is also a complete idiot and a total jerk. In only one example of his lack of cognitive function, he doesn't know who Michael Meyers is. That's like someone in Waco, Texas having no idea why their town is famous. The difficulty I had in mourning or caring about his death was matched only by the ease with which the fate of his relationship with Rachel could be predicted.One of the only people involved in the original Halloween and the first sequel is Donald Pleasance, who always performs wonderfully but here is given nothing more than a lot of lines where he talks about pure evil and he's not human and you don't know how to stop him and he's right here in this town you have to believe me, etc. etc. etc. Given that such an important part of the series agreed to come back, after Jamie Lee Curtis and John Carpenter declined to join, it would seem that they would put a little more effort into his part.In one scene, the movie threatens to go in a bad direction, when Loomis gets out of a police car and prepares to shoot down Michael Meyers, only to discover that he is surrounded by Meyerses. The horror at the thought of Michael having multiplied is clear on his face, but as he and the shocked officer with him prepare to fire, the kids pull off their masks and run off into the night, hooting and hollering about how funny they are and how great that was. These kids are so monumentally stupid that I wish at least one of them had been shot.Later in the film, after most of the police force has been killed off in their own police station by Michael Meyers, the local rednecks decide to take matters in their own hands. Meyers has been here before, killed too many kids, and now the police station is in ruins because of a single lurching man who doesn't even use guns (at one point in this movie he is even holding a shotgun pointed at a girl, and he stabs her with it rather than shoot her, a classic Meyers move). I'd get my shotgun, too. Not that I have one. But if I did, I'd be a little more discriminating as to when I'd take a shot. In a scene soon thereafter, the men see some movement in the bushes and they all unload on it, killing one of their friends. Nice. I love their strategy - everyone get their shotguns, and let's all pile into Earl's pickup truck and blow the hell out of anything that moves! Or Steve's truck, or Bill's, or whoever's it was. The best part was that when they got within shooting distance of Meyers, they all gave up and decided to leave it to the authorities.However, it should be noted that the tripe with which Halloween IV is filled is followed by a VERY impressive ending, which is the best ending that this movie could possibly have had and is also a tremendous homage to the original Halloween. It is very difficult for horror movies, especially when they are already getting up there in sequel numbers themselves, to have an ending that leaves the story open for yet another sequel. Most of the time a high-numbered sequel with an open ending makes me think something like Oh god, they're gonna do another one. Halloween IV, for all its flaws, not only doesn't do that, but it has such a good ending that it almost makes up for the rest of the garbage in the film. Were the rest of the movie as good as the ending, this would have been another classic.

I've played *video games* that were more convincing than this film, and they had *better acting* as well! I can't blame the actors though there's no script to speak of here. Lukas should have just built 'droid actors' to play all the parts, he would have achieved the same result. The plot - where it exists at all - takes a backseat and is largely just a vehicle or excuse to have our beloved Jedi knights hacking away at things with their lightsabres from the first five minutes of the film onwards. There's no buildup to anything in this film. It's ALL eye candy and no substance. And Lukas should be seriously taken to task - and possibly drawn and quartered - for the insufferable Jar Jar Binks and his racially-profiled pidgin dialect. Most of the 'creatures' in this film look like they would be more at home on the set of Sesame Street than in a science-fiction epic. A truly laughable, horrid film.I also think that, only a few years after its release, this film already looks horribly dated in a way that the original series does NOT and probably never will. That can easily be explained by Lukas' complete over-reliance on CGI technology which is developing in leaps and bounds every day. He basically boxed himself into obselescence with this one. The original series' production actually involved *designing and building REAL sets, and manipulating REAL cameras in creative and ground-breaking ways to capture scenes on REAL film - thus giving the original Star Wars a certain REAL quality that makes it 'believable' to the audience, even twenty-five years later. Instead of building on that legacy that so effectively married technology to traditional cinematic technique which found brilliant and creative ways to present its material, Lukas thinks that computers can solve all his directorial and cinematic 'problems'. The result is a film that has the longevity (and relevance) of an original Commodore 64 or Nintendo video game... In twenty years - in marked contrast to the original series - THIS film will be held up as an example as what happens when a filmmaker lets technology run amok and take the place of basic elements like story, plot, cinematography, and directing...

The characters are developed nicely and and you begin to take their side. The music is an excellent selection of classic rock tunes, such as Hold Your Head Up, and other good ones.By the end of the movie, I was laughing and cheering so hard I had tears coming down my face and I was falling out of my seat.

He stands up to them and tells them to shove it.I liked the movie so much that I bought the video, and my family and I have watched it many times, always laughing and cheering for the Kerrigans.I was somewhat surprised to see the negative reviews of this movie. I recommend it highly to anyone who likes to cheer for the underdog. There is some strong language that I wouldn't recommend for children. But there is no cheap sexual humor, and no gratuitous violence. I guess some people just can't appreciate a movie without these. This movie is just straightforward, honest comedy with an excellent theme. Look this movie up and see it. You will not be disappointed.

If you've seen it, you know it. Jack Torrance is typing away in this terribly non-conducive writing space, huge and imposing. Just then his wife Wendy walks in, asking him if he'd like some sandwiches, maybe let her read what he's written.Jack Nicholson is a marvel in this moment, letting her have it with both barrels for breaking my concentration. Whether she hears him typing, or doesn't hear him typing, she's not to walk in and disturb him, he tells her, not putting it nearly so pleasantly.As a writer, I laugh with recognition. But it's kind of a problem moment because it kills dead any concern I have for Jack Torrance 30 minutes into the movie. He's a bully as well as a deadbeat, who has cooped up his wife and kid in a snowbound old hotel with bad mojo leaking out the vents and then springs some heavy 'tude on the old woman for simply trying to offer him friendly company.The Shining is the horror film by Stanley Kubrick, a mega-talented but overrated auteur of several very well regarded films, five of which are in the IMDb Top 100 list (and a sixth, Full Metal Jacket, hovers just outside.) The Shining is the fifth most popular, but next to A Clockwork Orange my favorite, and probably the most enjoyable.It's a very disturbing and violent film in parts, more a mood piece than a gore fest but with some scary moments. Kubrick never had much of a sense of humor, and the film sleds quickly over a lot of territory author Stephen King explored more compellingly in his great novel. Certainly Jack Nicholson, who seems to be doing some kind of Bruce Dern imitation here, doesn't really give us a character so much as a caricature, and of the three principal actors, his manages to be both the weakest and most memorable.But The Shining is a great film once you realize Kubrick's vision here is to create an absorbing entertainment. For all his faults, he was a master of control, and demonstrates that here with shots that have become indelibly etched in cinematic history, like little Danny riding his Big Wheel across carpeted corners, Jack taking an axe to a door, and Wendy cowering in a corner screaming. It's a bitter story, and while I miss at times the humane angle King brought to the book, it's probably good that a movie version was helmed by someone as legendarily hard-hearted and unsentimental as Kubrick.I think The Simpsons have raised this film much higher in general estimation with their many nods and parodies in The Shining's direction. But The Shining speaks well of its creator Kubrick on its own terms, kind of as his goofball effort amid heavier-themed pictures and kind of as his demonstration of supreme technical craft. There's a great documentary attached to the DVD of this film which shows Kubrick setting up scenes, coaching little Danny Lloyd as Danny, and arguing with Shelley Duvall, who for my money gives the best performance as the only relatively normal denizen of the Overlook Hotel. It's really something to watch Kubrick so in his element.The Shining is all about Kubrick in his element, isolated, cold, squeezing the viewer's field of perception from every angle. It's a memorable ride from its opening fish-eyed tracking shot of a river road to the final black-and-white image, and a masterpiece that is impossible not to love on its own, unembraceable terms.

First of all, look at the cast. You have an ensemble of television stars getting into the big screen using this film as their vehicle. George Wendt and William Katt are prime examples of this. Their acting level is below minimal standards and you can really tell that they are acting. You never really see the struggle of Cobb trying to write his manuscript for his next novel while having to deal with the demons in the house. You never really understand why Wendt is against Katt so adamantly. You never really get an answer as to why he stayed in that house and dealt with the spirits the way that he did instead of just bolting out the door after the first scream. There are several questions unanswered and plenty of cheapness to this film, but &#133; and get this &#133; that is what makes it phenomenal.Let's take a deeper look at this film. To begin it is a horror\/comedy made in the 80s, which already sets the standard. The 80s were notorious for brining to light the horror\/comedy genre and they made no exception here. The set and sound are not the best in this film, while the monsters are completely 80s (for lack of a better word). You can definitely see the differences between gory monsters of today, and those made yesteryears. There seems to be a focus on the absurd in the 80s, instead of the grotesque and unbelievable of today's standards. This is a cheesy film, and it was meant to be. That is definitely something I miss with today's films. I saw it briefly in Shawn of the Dead, but it still hasn't come full circle yet. I need a rebirth of this genre. Less nudity, less gore, and more undeniably 80s monsters. I believe that people would still flock to see it. I know I would be in line. The set, cinematography, and acting were all perfect for this film. When I watched this movie again with some friends, there were some that had not seen it and jumped on several occasions. That says to me that it has maintained a fright factor. You can tell if a horror film has lasted the test of time if nearly 20 years later others are still jumping.What also worked perfectly in this film was the comedy aspect. I don't know if it was trying to go for the sub-genre of parody, but there were scenes that I saw in this film that reminded me of some of the classics like The Shining, Nightmare on Elm Street, Ghoulies, and Evil Dead. It was a very good mix that worked exceptionally well in building that extra chuckle whenever Cobb did something you know is absurd. He is the perfect example of your uneducated hero. When he should be running outside to regroup and collect his ideas, he is instead running upstairs where the terror is greater. Whenever he attempted to write, but was constantly interrupted by ghouls, goblins, or even the neighbor, it made me smile. He was not your average hero, yet somehow I found myself cheering for him at the end.Overall, this was your average cult horror film that the 80s were notorious for. If you walk into this film expecting today's standards, you will be disappointed. If you go into it thinking of what the 80s were like, especially in the horror genre in Hollywood, I think you will be utterly surprised.
