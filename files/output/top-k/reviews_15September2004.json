I finally decided to view this picture and enjoyed the great acting of George Clooney,(Captain Billy Tyne),Intolerable Cruelty,'03,who was a determined fisherman who wanted to make a big SWORDFISH CATCH of the Century! All his crew members were faithful and had to leave their loved ones heart broken. There are great scenes in the local bar where everyone gets together and cries in their beer with straight SHOTS of BOOZE! There is constant fear of the Sea and many women constantly worrying about their husbands or boyfriends. This was a very well produced film which captures the horrors of what the Atlantic OCEAN can produce when violent storms visit the EAST COAST fishing ports! Oh, by the way, Diane Lane,(Christina Cotter),Under the Tuscan Sun,'03 played a great sexy supporting role along with many of the other females.

It's got a loaded cast, great sci-fi action, martial art action, and just tons of excitement going on in the movie.Kurt Russell as Jack Burton is a one name you'll never forget, loves the long haul, and making the bets. Kim Cattrall as Gracie Law, still a sultry siren after Porky's. Being the second woman with green eyes. Speaking of green eyes, the woman playing Wang Chi's(Dennis Dun) fiancée was stunning. Though it's a rarity for Asian women to have green eyes, but anything can happen.The fight scene is the one thing I can't out of my mind. Especially the three storms. My brother and I would fight them with intensity. My brother would fight the Wind fighter with ease, I would take on the Lightning fighter, and we would both battle the Thunder fighter last. He was the toughest.Everything in the movie was great all the way to the end. It was never a dull moment throughout the movie. I LOVED IT! Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars. 9.5 out of 10!
