I saw the original Planet of the Apes a long time ago on TV but I do not remember much about it to be honest. I saw this DVD on sale in the local DVD store for &#128;2.50 - so I bought it. First mistake. Let me start with the director \/ plot. Tim Burton is a hot and cold director for me - I loved Scissorhands but not Batman. He's a gifted individual for sure but not everyone's cup of tea. Certainly not mine. However, he must have been on some sort of sedative when he decided to do this movie. The script was poor to say the least - which could have been written by a team of monkeys - such are the glaring inconsistencies and holes in it. I read somewhere that Wahlberg agreed to do this within 5 minutes of meeting Burton. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt that he never read the script because if he had - then I don't think he'd be so ready to sign on. The sets on this film looked just like they are - i.e. sets. Never was I ever convinced I was on a space station or in a spaceship or in an Ape city. Everything looked like it was made of cardboard and plastic and inside a huge hangar. I was extremely disappointed with Burton here as he has gone out of his way in the past for visually fantastic creations - here it is just lazy. Some of the cuts in the action scenes were laughable. Wahlberg supposedly gets thrown a distance of 30 to 40 feet in one scene and lands on the ground with a thud. The cut to him landing looks like he just jumped two feet onto the sand. Poor editing and no excuse for a director this experienced. Now the cast. Wahlberg - I must admit that he is a likable guy in movies normally and gets by. He always seems like a guy out of his depth though and someone punching above his weight. His brother Donnie is the more talented actor of the two - but because of Marky Mark's physique and modelling background, he gets the better gigs. Here though, he carries about as much dramatic weight as a wet rag. He whispers his lines without any tension or pathos - so much so that we as an audience do not care what happens to him. As I was watching, his character made no connection with me at all. He goes out in a pod in space, he crashes, he gets captured - and all the while I don't really care. Some of this is obviously script-related, but Marky has to take some of the blame too. Personally, I don't think he was ready to lead a movie at this stage of his career. He doesn't have an ounce of charisma. Roth - A talented actor normally - reduced to looking like Teen Wolf here and snarling in almost every scene to an off-screen object whilst close to the camera. He chews the scenery but underneath all that make-up he must have been so embarrassed. I was embarrassed watching him for God's sake so I cannot imagine how he felt. Bonham-Carter - The best of a bad lot to be fair. But she looked scarily like Michael Jackson that it put me off each time I laid eyes on her. But I thought she did the best she could with what she had. Warren - her part was just pure eye candy. Her character had no relevance to anything. Kristofferson - barely spoke and killed off early. Lucky him. Giamatti - unrecognisable under the make-up. Comic relief part only that wasn't even very funny.What's left to criticise here?

All joking aside, Hitchcock's second to last British film is a successful hybrid film which blends comedy and suspense in a way only a director like Hitchcock could do. While I can't compare it to the 1979 remake nor to other Hitchcock films of the era, I will boldly say that it has aged well and still has a wide audience.Watching The Lady Vanishes is like eating a chocolate, or how a chocolatier might encourage us to eat a chocolate. Both processes occur very slowly, but prove to be highly enjoyable in the Epicurean sense. The film takes about 25 minutes to unfold, and to be honest is rather boring. Hitchcock does, however, pepper it with witty dialog during the dinner and bedroom argument sequences. So, if you can tolerate the first open events, then your reward is one heck of a suspenseful film. When Miss Froy first disappears, Iris has difficulty finding her and accepting that she really has vanished. Hitchcock gives no indication as to where she could have gone, which increases our attention to her plight even more. We have no idea where she is, so we want Iris to find her just so we will feel relieved. This is an incredibly clever way to produce tension. Most films leave little clues as to how the person disappeared or where (s) he might be. When Iris and Gilbert actually start locating clues as to her whereabouts, the film actually becomes even more suspenseful as we still have no idea about where she is. Additionally, we still do not know why Miss Froy was kidnapped at all. The concluding confrontation with the rogues from the fictional country where Miss Froy was spying is a perfect blend of comedy and action. Some of the passengers seem so uncomfortable that watching them shoot invokes the same response when we see someone devour chocolate quickly. In both examples, our expectations of careful restraint of behavior are so completely incorrect that we laugh at how incorrect we are.If I haven't made myself entirely clear, let me plainly say that this is a highly imaginative and entertaining film. It is filled with referential British humor (two passengers are constantly complaining how they will be late for a cricket match) and genuine suspense. I think it's quite contrasting how such a comical film can also induce sophisticated tension. The resolution and explanation of Miss Froy's espionage are tad cheesy, but, from a modern perspective, most films of this era are. While one may not feel as terrified and mystified as he did watching Psycho, he'll still walk away with a warm feeling as if he had tasted the finest of European chocolates.

It's a novel by John Steinbeck telling of the California of Steinbeck's youth in the years just before World War I. It's the story of two brothers brought up by a self righteous father, one of whom is the apple of his eye and the other a complete screwup who can't get anything right. Sounds a lot like Cain and Abel, doesn't it? In Genesis it really doesn't go into why Abel was so favored by God as opposed to Cain. The only thing it says is about their occupations and presumably tending sheep is a better thing to do on the social scale than working with iron. God seems kind of arbitrary there as is the father Raymond Massey who's not named 'Adam' Trask for nothing.James Dean is the bad son named Caleb or Cal for short and Dick Davalos is the good son named Aaron. Davalos even aspires to the ministry, a calling no doubt Massey might have enjoyed. He's raised the two without a mother and he's told them she's dead.But Dean finds out different, she's not only alive, but is the prosperous madam of a bordello in nearby Monterey. Dean looks her up and saves his news for Davalos at a time when he's vulnerable. Like God seeming to arbitrarily and capriciously preferring Abel to Cain, Massey just favors this one son versus the other. Dean knows this on some level and it eats him alive. Julie Harris has a good role in the film as the fiancé of Davalos who gets more and more drawn to Dean as the film progresses. I very much liked Burl Ives who has the role of sheriff and who really functions as the audience's eyes and ears in East of Eden. It's his perspective from where the film is drawn. He has Massey down just about right, as a good man and a good friend, in many ways just too good and not real into the ways of the world.In Genesis God ordered Adam and Eve from paradise, but in East of Eden it's Adam who kicks Eve out. The mother is played by Jo Van Fleet who won a Best Supporting Actress Award that year. The confrontation scene with Dean and Davalos is unforgettable. James Dean was nominated for Best Actor in fact his was the first posthumous nomination given in any of the acting categories. He lost to Ernest Borgnine for Marty. Incredibly enough his last two films were both released after his death on September 29, 1955. It made the tragedy of a promising young star's death into 20th century legend.I'm not sure why Dick Davalos did not receive equal acclaim for his part as James Dean did. As the chip off the old Massey self righteous block it's far from a one dimensional portrayal. Davalos feels it almost his mission in life to reflect father in every way possible.The Steinbeck novel was much cut down, there's half the book which explains how the Trask family got to where it is that's completely missing and some more into the future to explain what happens to all of them. Still there's more than enough here and the salient parts of the story and the characters are not missed.

It's almost as though the new transition from silent to sound film had not yet given filmmakers enough time to polish their work. Fritz Lang directs some scenes in M with the full force of the sound technique--namely, the scenes where the criminals and police are both telling us why they want to capture the serial killer of little girls. Then, there's an abrupt switch to silent technique as we follow the man on his rounds (PETER LORRE) and watch as he finds a hideout that drags much of the last part of the film out beyond necessity.A taut filming of this story, with the same clever use of shadows and atmospheric effects, and perhaps some menacing background music on the soundtrack, would have made M a much more efficient thriller.A smoother technique of telling both a heist tale, the hunt for a serial killer and an ending loaded with social commentary on the workings of a sick mind, require much more than Fritz Lang was able to deliver within the confines of a film that is part silent and part talkie in technique.PETER LORRE plays the killer with his usual wide-eyed look of terror (the deer in the headlights look that he perfected over and over again in other films), but there are times when a little restraint in his performance might have helped.

Ebert wrote that this was the first movie he'd seen in a while where the black characters relate to each other instead of a hypothetical white audience--it is this that gives the movie its engrossing authenticity. (If it matters, I'm white.) As funny as the movie can be, it's also incredibly hard-hitting--there's a sequence in the last 20 minutes where Julian, Big Brother Al-migh-tee, insists his girlfriend prove her love, that's almost unwatchable and yet brutally honest. Lee has been called sexist for his underwritten female characters--there may be some truth to that but School Daze is far more critical of the men than the women. Rachel, Dap's girlfriend, is perhaps the most levelheaded, likable character in the movie, and is strong and supportive of Dap while still maintaining her independence. Even the Gamma Rays, who come off as shallow and colorist in the beginning, are sympathetic as they stand up for and try to aid the pledges during hazing. The characters who come off the worst are the GPG brothers who are, almost to a man, brutish, sadistic and crude.

This does not prevent some critics from dumping on Titus as a second-rate play and questioning Shakespeare's Quentin Tarantino moment. Titus Andronicus seems anything but second rate, however, in the skilled hands of director Julie Taymor whose 1999 film Titus is one of the most entertaining and extravagant Shakespeare interpretations on film. Anthony Hopkins is terrific as the head of the excellent ensemble cast that provides some depth to the thin characters and Taymor is able to extract humor from the grim proceedings while providing dazzling imagery and an adrenaline rush.A special mention should also be given to Harry Lennix as Tamora's servant Aaron, one of the few black characters in Shakespeare. Aaron is a complex character, both diabolical and attractive for his fierce love of his child. Irreligious and rebellious, he is the model for the motif of the outsider and the precursor of Shylock, Malvolio, and Othello.Though Titus is generally believed to have been written in 1593 (it was published anonymously in 1594), Ben Jonson's comment in 1614 that the play has held the stage for twenty-five or thirty years (dismissed as an exaggeration) might bring the date of composition closer to the period of 1584-1589. Since Titus, like Macbeth, was doubtless influenced by the barbarous Wars of Religion during the late 16th century, there is speculation that an earlier version might have been written around 1576 at the time of the war between the Spanish Catholics and the Dutch Protestants known as the Spanish Fury with Saturninus representing Philip of Spain and Livonia representing the rape of Antwerp.Titus deals with themes that run throughout the canon the problem of succession &#150; who has the rightful claim to rule, revenge, and the idea of banishment (exile) and return, and the play is reminiscent of King Lear in its obsession with insanity induced by loss. Expressing his alienation through the figures of the fool, the bastard, and the king without a crown, Shakespeare's heroes are demonic, men who live on the edge, appearing at times like a monster in the guise of Caliban, Bottom, and Edgar and other times like Prospero, a philosopher king. Caliban is his base ambition, but Prospero is his higher self.Though proximity to the center of power drives Titus close to madness and the play seems to be saying that madness is the only escape from suffering, the ending brings a restoration of moral sanity and hopes for an era of peace. Oxfordians note that the severed hand metaphor may indicate that the author was severed from his writings but the text still bears the hand of their creator. In the phrase of author Charles Beauclerk, Divorced from his works and cut off from the wellspring of his creativity, his unconscious inundates the plays and his emotional pain overwhelms the text. Taymor meshes three time periods in the film ancient Rome, fascism in the 1930's and the modern era. The plot, which is completely fictional, is set in the late Roman Imperial era as the Empire attempts to hold off barbarian Gothic invaders. As Titus opens, a modern day energetic young boy (Osheen Jones) has decided to smash up his kitchen while playing with action figures. He is then seized by a clown and dragged into the world of fifth century Rome where he takes on the role of Titus' grandson. Similar to Romeo and Juliet in its theme of conflict between families, the play begins with competing authorities as both Saturninus (Alan Cumming) and Bassanius (James Frain) both claim the throne. A robotic procession of soldiers in ancient Rome is led by aging General Titus Andronicus (Anthony Hopkins) who is returning to Rome after a victorious battle against the Goths.Andronicus brings with him prisoners Queen Tamora (Jessica Lange), Aaron (Harry Lennix) and her sons Chiron (Jonathan Rhys Myers) and Demetrius (Matthew Rhys). Titus is offered the crown vacated by the death of Caesar but refuses it, designating instead the flamboyant Saturninus as Emperor. When Tamora's eldest son Alarbus is murdered by Andronicus as a human sacrifice to the gods, she is able to use the weak-willed Saturnine as her vehicle for revenge, crying O cruel, irreligious piety.When Titus' daughter Lavinia (Laura Fraser), the wife chosen by Saturnine, is abducted by Bassianus, Saturnine chooses Tamora as his wife, setting off a bloody sequence of events that include mutilation, rape and murder, and an orgy of death in which a mother eats her son's remains baked in a pie, mirroring Book VI of Ovid's Metamorphosis. That this could be entertaining is a tribute to Taymor's audacity and, of course, the obsessive brilliance of Shakespeare.

Titus is offered the crown vacated by the death of Caesar but refuses it, designating instead the flamboyant Saturninus as Emperor. When Tamora's eldest son Alarbus is murdered by Andronicus as a human sacrifice to the gods, she is able to use the weak-willed Saturnine as her vehicle for revenge, crying O cruel, irreligious piety.When Titus' daughter Lavinia (Laura Fraser), the wife chosen by Saturnine, is abducted by Bassianus, Saturnine chooses Tamora as his wife, setting off a bloody sequence of events that include mutilation, rape and murder, and an orgy of death in which a mother eats her son's remains baked in a pie, mirroring Book VI of Ovid's Metamorphosis. That this could be entertaining is a tribute to Taymor's audacity and, of course, the obsessive brilliance of Shakespeare.

This does not prevent some critics from dumping on Titus as a second-rate play and questioning Shakespeare's Quentin Tarantino moment. Titus Andronicus seems anything but second rate, however, in the skilled hands of director Julie Taymor whose 1999 film Titus is one of the most entertaining and extravagant Shakespeare interpretations on film. Anthony Hopkins is terrific as the head of the excellent ensemble cast that provides some depth to the thin characters and Taymor is able to extract humor from the grim proceedings while providing dazzling imagery and an adrenaline rush.A special mention should also be given to Harry Lennix as Tamora's servant Aaron, one of the few black characters in Shakespeare. Aaron is a complex character, both diabolical and attractive for his fierce love of his child. Irreligious and rebellious, he is the model for the motif of the outsider and the precursor of Shylock, Malvolio, and Othello.Though Titus is generally believed to have been written in 1593 (it was published anonymously in 1594), Ben Jonson's comment in 1614 that the play has held the stage for twenty-five or thirty years (dismissed as an exaggeration) might bring the date of composition closer to the period of 1584-1589. Since Titus, like Macbeth, was doubtless influenced by the barbarous Wars of Religion during the late 16th century, there is speculation that an earlier version might have been written around 1576 at the time of the war between the Spanish Catholics and the Dutch Protestants known as the Spanish Fury with Saturninus representing Philip of Spain and Livonia representing the rape of Antwerp.Titus deals with themes that run throughout the canon the problem of succession &#150; who has the rightful claim to rule, revenge, and the idea of banishment (exile) and return, and the play is reminiscent of King Lear in its obsession with insanity induced by loss. Expressing his alienation through the figures of the fool, the bastard, and the king without a crown, Shakespeare's heroes are demonic, men who live on the edge, appearing at times like a monster in the guise of Caliban, Bottom, and Edgar and other times like Prospero, a philosopher king. Caliban is his base ambition, but Prospero is his higher self.Though proximity to the center of power drives Titus close to madness and the play seems to be saying that madness is the only escape from suffering, the ending brings a restoration of moral sanity and hopes for an era of peace. Oxfordians note that the severed hand metaphor may indicate that the author was severed from his writings but the text still bears the hand of their creator. In the phrase of author Charles Beauclerk, Divorced from his works and cut off from the wellspring of his creativity, his unconscious inundates the plays and his emotional pain overwhelms the text. Taymor meshes three time periods in the film ancient Rome, fascism in the 1930's and the modern era. The plot, which is completely fictional, is set in the late Roman Imperial era as the Empire attempts to hold off barbarian Gothic invaders. As Titus opens, a modern day energetic young boy (Osheen Jones) has decided to smash up his kitchen while playing with action figures. He is then seized by a clown and dragged into the world of fifth century Rome where he takes on the role of Titus' grandson.

Angelina Jolie was the perfect choice though in high school my teacher thought that Catherine Zeta Jones fit the part better due to her Welsh accent, I beg to differ. Jolie, who is known to being rebellious, performed most of her own stunts while going through gun training at the same time where in this film she's off to find an important artifact that can make people go back in time. The plot could only matter to those who feel like paying attention, but in the end it's really the action sequences with Jolie and lots of visual effects that matter.
