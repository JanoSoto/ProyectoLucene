Being a fella in his his early thirties who had grown up on Brat Pack movies didn't help.Had seen Shane West previously in 'Get Over It'(not his best work!) and knew of Mandy Moore but had never seen a review of the film, read the book, nothing.First five minutes I thought, nothing new here. But then as the minutes went by and the first scenes between West and Moore came on screen,I couldn't get over the chemistry between the two leads. I thought both Moore and West were excellent throughout even more surprising when I find out since, it was Moore's first lead role! The 'She's All That'clone thought did enter my mind worryingly at one point but that was refreshingly put to bed. It was lovely to see a film like this for once taking a different track. I expected the usual that you typically expect in a film like this, Jamie ends up looking like a beauty queen, Landon gives into his mates and stops seeing her, Jamie falls out with her Dad as he forbids her to see Landon etc. How wrong was I? Without giving the game away it was such a change to see a relationship being allowed to develop before our eyes for once.As for the twist I won't spoil it but I too have been personally effected by a situation such as Jamie's and I have to say I broke down a bit at that point. OK, it was handled in the movie 'Hollywood style' but at least it was done in my opinion sensitively, it did try and show the immense emotions you\/friends\/relatives find yourself in such a situation.Since seeing the movie I've read lots of critical reviews and I have to say I've been really annoyed by some of their inane comments and opinions. Clearly most of the critics went in to review this film with their minds already made up. However Roger Eberts review on 'external links' I thought was an honest and accurate description of the movie. Sure, corny in parts, but hey what movie isn't.It's nice to see I'm not alone in that a lot of people seem to have come across this gem of a movie by accident on cable or satellite etc and been really moved by it just like me. I cannot recommend it highly enough.I understand the film is a pretty good adaptation of the book, slightly updated, so I'm off to buy the DVD and the book!

The movie is very thought provoking and the concept of us eating trash today is very similar to what Soylent Green is all about.

He is a failed inventor, who's inventions are nothing less than brilliant, but the world only turns its back on them. Every time he leaves the house, he is disgusted at what he sees - a globalist world falling apart that looks like a toilet. Then there are his wife and children, who love Allie dearly, but cannot see the world through the same eyes.Working for an Asparagas business, Allie devises a new invention, an ingenious Asparagus cooler, that cools without an electrical cord. But his boss only dismisses it as a joke, labeling it a contraption! It is here that Allie turns HIS back on the world and confronts his dreams.Consistently exposing his sons to embarrassment and ridicule of the township in which they live because of his rude approach to those he despises with his extreme views of modern politics and globalization, it is no surprise that his children (particularly his sons) are excited about the idea of starting a whole new life in the jungles of Nicaragua - The Mosquito Coast. A place of a simple, natural life, where Allie can be recognized for his genius. A place where very few people have seen or know the existence of ICE.We eat when we're not hungry. Drink when we're not thirsty. We buy what we don't need and throw away everything that's useful. Why sell a man what he wants. Sell him what he doesn't need. Pretend he's got eight legs, two stomachs and money to burn. Wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong! - Allie Fox\/Harrison Ford When his family begins to understand his vision, Allie purchases his own town in the depths of the jungles - in the middle of god's nowhere. It is here that the natives see him as a god send. His ingenious Cooling machine named 'Fatboy', capable of cooling houses, making cold water and most importantly ICE, unites a whole jungle into his hand and a pioneering village of fine agriculture is constructed - consequently creating competition and enemies afar.Ice is civilization. That's Why I came. That's Why I'm Here! - Allie Fox\/Harrison Ford Does Allie's brilliant visions prevail or destroy him and his family?This has to be the most powerful film regarding the nature of humanity, in that it doesn't need any graphic violence to show you just how far the human can go before he\/she breaks. Allie Fox is the perfect example of a man that goes too far - to the edge. He dislikes the world he lives in due to its greed, violence, globalization, politics and the complacency of its people. Deciding it is best to start his own civilization, he soon comes to terms with the fact that HE is no different to those he despises. The parallels portrayed in the film between Allie's little world and the rest of the world are poignantly executed. Aside from very minor problems, this film is absolutely flawless in showing this. Peter Weir masterfully brought the book of the same name to the screen.Harrison Ford's performance as Allie Fox is a must see for all film buffs out there. His commanding presence is one thing - his performance is one of the greatest I have ever seen! He portrays Allie's obsession with such passion, you are easily convinced that he is indeed Allie Fox. Surprisingly he didn't win an Academy Award, but was nominated for a Golden Globe. Equally brilliant in his performance was River Phoenix, playing Allie's son Charlie. The fear, confusion and love he shows for his father is very powerful and extremely convincing. He comes to the Mosquito Coast a boy and leaves like an older man. Helen Mirren, a wonderful British actress, was a great choice - different from your typical American wife who constantly can't keep her mouth shut - who portrays a caring mother who's influence on Allie deteriorates yet remains a means of hope for her children. The whole cast did an excellent job.Peter Weir, perhaps the greatest Australian director, yet again made an unforgettable, powerful epic experience that I can only summarize in one word as a masterpiece. Being the second feature along side Harrison Ford following 'Witness' - another great film - Weir's direction is that of an artist and like John Carpenter, is a master of adding atmospheric life to film - like you were really there. He is a wonderful story teller and it would be a blessing to see him work with Ford again.What also really struck me in the film was the beautiful cinematography and the absolutely extraordinary score composed by Doctor Zhivago's Maurice Jarre. Locations were exotic and suited the film perfectly - gave almost a mythical feel to the film. However the music set the moods incredibly well. At times it was extremely uplifting. You just feel like your in another world in this film.How can I summarize this film experience in few words. This is one of the very few films that changed my perspective of humanity and life in a masterful, epic way. Every time I watch it, only becomes more and more powerful. Yet, this isn't only a movie about world issues and the nature of man, but it is rather also a great way to escape to another world for an hour and a half. Immensely enjoyable film which is an undisputed classic. I recommend it to anybody who enjoys film, escapism and stories about life. You won't be disappointed.

It would appear that he and his production team read the books, sort of, maybe 30 years ago; bought the Cliff notes, and from that wrote the screenplay. To illustrate my POV, I recommend listening to the superlative 13 hour radio adaptation produced by the BBC, recorded I believe in 1981.Jackson and crew erred when they depended too much on computer fx, and spent too much time on the spectacle of combat and war. I often thought I was watching a slasher movie. What makes the original Trilogy compelling are the relationships and the subtext characters carry with them from beginning to end. To be sure there are mythic battles, both large and small.

Unfortunately, my hope was in vain as this film followed the Disney-style adventure to an absolute T. There was no way the child was going to come to harm, nor his parents. It was very much like The Lost World in that you knew Spielberg would never allow harm to come to children. It really detracted from the suspense element. As soon as you saw who was in the plane on the way to the island, you could easily predict who would get eaten and who would make it off the island.Back to Tea Leoni. What was she thinking??? Or perhaps I should say, what was the director thinking? What a lame female lead! At least with Julianne Moore and Laura Dern, the women showed an ounce of competence! Teo Leoni acts not like she is on a dinosaur island, but more like she has just come across Scooby Doo. Terrible, just terrible. I fully appreciate comedic moments in suspenseful films to relieve some of the tension, however this movie had very few actual suspenseful moments and the comedic moments were more worth of an Ernest movie.Why does Spielberg insist on having children as the action heroes? Jurassic Park was a very exciting movie, but then he had to go and introduce the Wonder Twins in The Lost World. Killing a raptor by a parallel bars routine?????? It's the same rubbish in this movie, a 12-year old survives for 8 weeks on the island whilst mercenaries don't last 5 minutes. It's the same reason The Temple of Doom was the worst of the Indiana Jones and Phantom Menace was the worst of the Star Wars movies. Just leave the kids at home!!

Or perhaps I should say, what was the director thinking? What a lame female lead! At least with Julianne Moore and Laura Dern, the women showed an ounce of competence! Teo Leoni acts not like she is on a dinosaur island, but more like she has just come across Scooby Doo. Terrible, just terrible. I fully appreciate comedic moments in suspenseful films to relieve some of the tension, however this movie had very few actual suspenseful moments and the comedic moments were more worth of an Ernest movie.Why does Spielberg insist on having children as the action heroes? Jurassic Park was a very exciting movie, but then he had to go and introduce the Wonder Twins in The Lost World. Killing a raptor by a parallel bars routine?????? It's the same rubbish in this movie, a 12-year old survives for 8 weeks on the island whilst mercenaries don't last 5 minutes. It's the same reason The Temple of Doom was the worst of the Indiana Jones and Phantom Menace was the worst of the Star Wars movies. Just leave the kids at home!! There is no reason to make them all into super-heroes, it just detracts from the adventure and the suspense.Sam Neill, as usual, was excellent. Other than the dinosaurs, he is the one holding this picture together. I just can't help feeling disappointed for what could have been a great movie. The dinosaurs were incredibly well done, and there were a lot of them. It's just the acting, plot, and general story which were lacking. And what was the editor thinking including those terribly unrealistic para-sailing shots at the beginning???? There are some good distance shots, but then the close-ups are so obviously shot on a set that I cannot believe they let that pass. Sloppy, just sloppy. To think they could bring dinosaurs to life in a realistic manner but then leave in shots that look like they come from a 1970's TV adventure is just ludicrous.5\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"}]
