You see the jurors small talking with each other, and each little story reveals something about the persons.

The first few shots introduce all the main characters that are important to the story without it even feeling like that was the intention. We are shown the dance club, roller girl, Maurice, Jack and Amber\/Maggie, Eddie\/Dirk, and Little Bill (William H. Macy). Amazing that Anderson could be so blunt with that and not even feel like you're being smothered with characters. Brilliant directing.Boogie Nights is one of my favorite films. It deals with the rise and fall of numerous characters during the peak of pornography in the 70's and early 80's. Mark Wahlberg gives probably his best performance we might ever see. Burt Reynolds plays Jack Horner, a filmmaker trying to tell stories through pornography. Hard task but he's a man of vision and the character in my mind is a genius. This too was a great performance by not my favorite Burt Reynolds.This film should be studied by cinematographers and writers alike. My best and easily acceptable example is the donut shop scene. Cinematographers note that in this scene there are so many opprotunities for reflection but not once do you see the camera. Not once. This, in my opinion is one of the best scenes. The beauty of that scene shows how simple the human mind really is. Don Cheadle had numerous options after what happens and you could see it in his face that he was thinking about what to do. He chooses selfishness, takes the bag and runs, which I believe most of us would choose.Writers take note that Boogie Nights goes into great character development and has a number of characters to build. Paul Thomas Anderson is I think one of the best writers of our era. His understanding of human suffering and confusion brings his characters to life. Especially Eddie Adams and Jack Horner. Anderson shows even more depth and emotion in his film Magnolia. But that's another story.If you don't like Boogie Nights that's perfectly alright. The beauty of Boogie Nights is that the film is about the 70's porn era, but there is barely any nudity when plenty could have been put in. The film doesn't glorify pornography, it shows how great and terrible it can be. Or at least how quickly something good can be swept out from under you. Boogie Nights is about people and their belonging in this world, whether it be the porn industry or anything else. It's not about porn, or sex, or making drugs seem great. It shows how easily people can be corrupted and ruined by the things around them. I love this film and recommend it to anyone who is going to study film.Why Anderson hasn't recieved an oscar for writing and directing I don't know. His films keep getting better and deeper. The thought provoking movies he has made keep me coming back for more. I'm sure he has plenty of ideas for the next decade or so to entertain the masses.

Here we see real immigrants (both legal and illegal) being used rather cynically by companies whose business plan includes hiring the most downtrodden and fearful and hand-to-mouth in our country, paying them the lowest possible wages, giving them absolutely no benefits whatsoever, and thereby winning contracts to provide custodial and other services over companies that pay a fair and living wage, plus benefits, to primarily unionized employees who are American citizens. You know this really happens. It does. The best remedy for the situation is certainly a matter for debate, but no matter what your political slant or position on labor unions and illegal immigrants, you will most definitely find food for thought herein.OTOH, if you are also one of the drooling legions of newbie Adrien Brody fangirls, you will find even more food for thought.  Brody is painfully cute in this movie-a piquant mixuture of earnest, funny, sincere, sweet, and fiery, topped off with a kinghell case of `bedhead'.The three central players are Pilar Padilla, as idealistic illegal immigrant Maya, her overburdened sister Rosa, played by Elipidia Carillo, and Brody as Sam Shapiro, an organizer and activist for the cause.  No fairy tale, this movie, though a few of the cast are reasonably good-looking.  The cast, many of whom really are janitors and custodians, are as real as it gets.  You can see a lifetime of hard labor and long hours in their faces, and the slump to their shoulders.I really grew to like these struggling janitors and maids. None of them were types--they were all real people and their conflicts and concerns were illuminated very well, despite limited screen time being available to each. By treating these characters with respect and making them fully-fleshed out, it made the passion of the organizers for this particular cause more understandable, and not just as sometimes seems the case in some portrayals, a matter of someone who is bored or spoiled or has some sort of guilt-complex trying to find their identity and using do-gooderism as a means to that end.  Through coming out from the shadows, and joining the great and messy American experience of organized dissent, you could practically see some of these characters changing into `Americans' before your eyes, no matter what their official papers might say.  Thinking like Americans, standing up for their rights, making their voices heard. That's how it's supposed to work-isn't it?  Isn't it?If there are caricatures in this movie, then those would be some of the building administrators, but their screen time is so limited, and they are usually so surprised and besieged by Sam Shapiro's stunts and protests that their lack of articulate or sympathetic response seems realistic enough to me. But the one thing that stands out is more than anything else is the absolutely natural acting style. Nobody really seems to be acting in this movie. It's as if there was a very unobtrusive documentary maker following these folks around. The movie is, however, well-paced between scenes which are rousing or charming, and those which are raw and painful.Although this movie is not a love story or romance, per se, Adrien's character does get some action in it. In fact, in one amusing scene, he is literally hauled into a janitor's closet by an enterprising female (smart girl!!) and snogged silly. One can but applaud that sort of enterprise and initiative on the part of a recent arrival to this great country of ours. That's the kind of can-do immigrant spirit that made this country great, and if I were there, I would be sure to tell her how much I admired that quality in her, when I visited her in the hospital to apologize for having accidentally whacked her out of the way with a long-handled mop.But it can't all be funny and cute, and indeed, in this same section of the movie is a scene of such raw emotion, harsh language, honesty, and truth, between the two Mexican sisters that I cannot say I have ever seen anything like it. Even Ebert said in his review that it's the kind of scene that would win an Oscar if the Academy ever saw movies like this, which of course, they don't.The ending is both feel-good triumphant, and bittersweet. I think that such an ending was very much in keeping with the tone and overall realism of this movie--yes, some things changed for the better, but for people like these, not everyone gets that happy ending and lives happily ever after. At least, not right away.There's real passion here, on the part of everyone involved, and it feels genuine, not manipulative.

No fairy tale, this movie, though a few of the cast are reasonably good-looking.  The cast, many of whom really are janitors and custodians, are as real as it gets.  You can see a lifetime of hard labor and long hours in their faces, and the slump to their shoulders.I really grew to like these struggling janitors and maids. None of them were types--they were all real people and their conflicts and concerns were illuminated very well, despite limited screen time being available to each. By treating these characters with respect and making them fully-fleshed out, it made the passion of the organizers for this particular cause more understandable, and not just as sometimes seems the case in some portrayals, a matter of someone who is bored or spoiled or has some sort of guilt-complex trying to find their identity and using do-gooderism as a means to that end.  Through coming out from the shadows, and joining the great and messy American experience of organized dissent, you could practically see some of these characters changing into `Americans' before your eyes, no matter what their official papers might say.  Thinking like Americans, standing up for their rights, making their voices heard. That's how it's supposed to work-isn't it?  Isn't it?If there are caricatures in this movie, then those would be some of the building administrators, but their screen time is so limited, and they are usually so surprised and besieged by Sam Shapiro's stunts and protests that their lack of articulate or sympathetic response seems realistic enough to me. But the one thing that stands out is more than anything else is the absolutely natural acting style. Nobody really seems to be acting in this movie. It's as if there was a very unobtrusive documentary maker following these folks around. The movie is, however, well-paced between scenes which are rousing or charming, and those which are raw and painful.Although this movie is not a love story or romance, per se, Adrien's character does get some action in it. In fact, in one amusing scene, he is literally hauled into a janitor's closet by an enterprising female (smart girl!!) and snogged silly. One can but applaud that sort of enterprise and initiative on the part of a recent arrival to this great country of ours. That's the kind of can-do immigrant spirit that made this country great, and if I were there, I would be sure to tell her how much I admired that quality in her, when I visited her in the hospital to apologize for having accidentally whacked her out of the way with a long-handled mop.But it can't all be funny and cute, and indeed, in this same section of the movie is a scene of such raw emotion, harsh language, honesty, and truth, between the two Mexican sisters that I cannot say I have ever seen anything like it. Even Ebert said in his review that it's the kind of scene that would win an Oscar if the Academy ever saw movies like this, which of course, they don't.The ending is both feel-good triumphant, and bittersweet. I think that such an ending was very much in keeping with the tone and overall realism of this movie--yes, some things changed for the better, but for people like these, not everyone gets that happy ending and lives happily ever after. At least, not right away.There's real passion here, on the part of everyone involved, and it feels genuine, not manipulative.  It's a pleasure to see a movie with good quality production values and excellent acting which was made for a reason, not just to make money.

Ellen Burstyn disappears completely into her character--she's so authentic in this role that it chokes your heart.  Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly have never been this good (some would say they've never been good at all, before or since).  Even Marlon Wayans, that goofiest of Wayanses, is unexpectedly touching in his key supporting role.Darren Aronofksy's technique is quite astonishing.  It's interesting (and heartening) to see how popular the movie's become with young people, as its chilly formalism has more in common with art-house provocateurs like Peter Greenaway than with all those flashy new talents who used to make music videos.  At the same time, the technical virtuosity never overwhelms the narrative; in fact, it tricks you into thinking the simplistic message is more profound than it is.  The rolling, nightmarish sequence leading to the film's climax, made even more feverish by Clint Mansell's incessant score, is so searingly intense that you may feel physically sick afterwards.

It may be the most powerful and disturbing fifteen minutes ever put on film, and to deny its effectiveness, even as a propaganda tool, would be wrong.And a propaganda tool is exactly what it is.  As an anti-drug message film, it's nowhere near as sophisticated as `Trainspotting'; its message is writ far too large for that.  And as entertaining as the film's aesthetic elements are, the relentless moralizing can be wearying.  `Requiem for a Dream' puts its message into a box (in this case a refrigerator) and hits you over the head with it over and over again.Then again, the aesthetic elements are so strong that talk of thematic subtleties seems like carping.

A a matter of fact I asked my videopusher if i could buy it. He said yes, because it was not a title there was being rented anymore. And I have never regreted that trade for a second. In this one you'll find everything you need Horror, action, black comedy and some sex. Not bad, huh?

I even liked her in that film where she went into a beauty pageant. But in this monstrosity, I just wanted to slap her repeatedly and say What are you doing!?She is just dire. Not in acting (well... any more than usual, anyway) but just in the way her character made you want to shake her until she regained some sense. Whoever was responsible for the script needs a good beating here. Unless I am completely mistaken, her character between the events of the first film and this one, turned into a complete and total airhead bimbo.Add in Jason Patric (who will never be leading man material) and it seems that only Willem Dafoe was having any fun. Truly awful!But it is good to see that ocean liners, which may have to weather tropical storms, apparently have windows made of glass so easy to break that anyone can hurl themselves through them on a whim. Priceless cinema.Avoid this one if you liked the original.Avoid this one if you expect a thrilling sea drama.Avoid this one if you like Sandra Bullock.Avoid this one if....well....just avoid it.

One of the reasons for this movie being so great is the casting of Jeff Bridges in the lead, he's the most Un-Hollywood actors out there, possibly because he is so underrated, and very likable in all of his films.  Tim Robbins played the evil neighbor very well also.  This is one of those movies that makes you want to find out more about people before you start to trust them too well.
