Much of his ambition is driven from his underachieving family, headed by an alcoholic mom and a nerdy beta male dad. His two older siblings aren't much better. He just can't seem to make sense of how he, a seemingly cool guy in a garage rock band, with a hot girlfriend, can be related to these losers. It is easy to see why he was drawn to a persistent dreamer, an inventor by the name of Doctor Emmett L. Brown. This relationship leads him on the adventure of a lifetime - not just his, but those of his ancestors and descendants.Over the course of the film, Marty finds out that his loser, hopeless parents, once had the same hope for the future and dreams that he had. He finds out that his dad got that way that he is by suppressing his dreams to become an author due to fear of rejection, much like Marty himself is afraid of taking his guitar talents all the way. He also finds that his seemingly traditional nun of a mom was actually quite the opposite in her earlier years. It turns out they aren't that much different from himself as he had imagined.This is a major theme of the film. It was very relevant in the era of the 80s, where so-called generation gap alienated teens from parents who came from an era before the cultural revolution of the 60s and 70s. Often many young people of that time thought what they saw in 50s reruns (also referenced in the film) was the way life was really life back in the 50s. This is natural. For whatever reason, younger generations paint a picture of previous generations. Some of this is their own imagination based on a lack of experience, and some is the idea that parents have of making sure their kids don't repeat the same mistakes that they did. Either way, it is an issue that kids of the Generation X or MTV Generation dealt with, and also covered in John Hughes movies like the Breakfast Club.Another theme is that of the wise sage and his protégé. This goes back to ancient times, Alexander and Aristotle, David and Samuel, Arthur and Merlin, and so on. This relationship is also used in the Star Wars movies, with Luke and Obi-Wan. Of course in the modern frame of reference, a wizard, philosopher or prophet becomes a mad scientist aloof to the world, and the young protégé is a high school kid who plays the guitar and rides a skateboard. The basic idea, however, is still the same. The old man, declining in years, passes on some wisdom to the next generation and helps the hero come of age.Back to the Future is, after all, a coming of age story. It is perhaps *the* coming of age story of the generation. While some come to the realization that their problems are not unique to their era through contemplation, Marty came to this realization based on first hand experience. Marty starts out somewhat immature and naive about the world. He thinks every parent started out as a parent (with maybe a few less gray hairs) and that for him it will be different. He starts to realize that the way people are in their adult life are the direct result of their choices as dumb teens, when they think that they know better. Back to the Future is a trilogy, of course, so Marty doesn't learn all of his lessons in the first movie, but he does learn a lot of them.Of course this is not all that the movie offers. There are perfectly-executed action sequences, the stories of Marty's parents getting a second chance at life, and one of the best villains in a teen movie - Biff Tannen. A lot can be said about the small town of Hill Valley, with its repeating generational problems. However, I don't think this message is as universal since most today live in different towns and neighborhoods than their parents did. Still it an amusing plot device to see how these small town families repeat the same patterns over the generations. Even the manure haulers are not left out of this generational gag.I call Back to the Future epic, because it is. It deals with a heavy issue - time, and plays with it in ways no other movie has before or since. The heroic scale of preserving one's own material existence seems to me to be worthy of being called epic. The isolated three-dimensional location of Hill valley is purposely small and obscure. It is not a sprawling land like Tolkien's Middle Earth or a vast space empire like Lucas' Galaxy far away. Its is very unlikely it has had many newcomers in its 100+ years of history. This isolated spot is not to give the movie a quaint feel, as small towns are used in other films, but to focus on the epic nature of time itself. The musical soundtrack of this film definitely adds to the epic feel of the movie. It is still a sci-fi comedy, however, and there are plenty of laughs to be had, and many technical wonders to behold. It's best not to label the movie and enjoy it for what it is. I think movies like this defy traditional labeling by genre.

The movie does a brief introduction of all the leads and then the movie's pace picks up and the speed at which it carries on is one that is so impressive that I myself never believed it could keep up, but it did. Brett Ratner the director was on top of the situation and the blend of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan was masterful.The story\/plot that the movie is based is one that you can point out the holes, some of the situations that these two were able to get out of were eyebrow raising, not to mention how both manage not to get killed is one thing that you must try to overlook as watch, because that is only how you can truly enjoy this movie.The movie starts in Hong Kong, when Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) was able to recover some priceless historical treasures. After the recovery the Chinese Consul Solon Han moved to America and while there, his daughter got kidnapped by a known Hong Kong crime lord Juntao. The Chinese Consul asked for Inspector Lee to come and aid the FBI in the investigations and recover of his daughter.Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) is a LAPD cop that finds it hard to just do anything right, so in form of a punishment his captain loan him to the FBI to be a babysitter to Lee and keep him out of their way. But selfish Carter wants to solve the crime and so does Lee so together both, did all they could to recover the Chinese Consul's daughter.Much of what they did seemed like they were moving 1 step forward and 2 steps back, but in the end it all paid off.Rush Hour 1 was a hit and it was well received. The combination of both actors (Chan and Tucker), made the news as all loved the mix, and at the very end made the movie a box office hit.Later on, two other sequels were made with Chan and Carter reprising their roles respectively as Inspector Lee and Detective Carter and we get to see them take on other crime lords and cause major chaos where ever they go. Rush Hour is a fine film from the 90s that even after you watch now, you will still be laughing hard, the movie came out same year that Lethal Weapon 4 was released, which also starred a martial art actor Jet Li.

Chan and Tucker have a way of keeping you glued as their combination is mouth watering, but after I was done watching this film&#x85; I enjoyed seeing the errors than I did seeing the film itself.Is not that Rush Hour 2 didn't have it's funny parts, because it did, it is just that from the set go you will know that the makers are trying so hard to make something out of nothing. At the end they achieved it all, they got us to go see the movie, got us to remember the movie for some also near death experience that makes you wonder just like in Rush Hour 1 and they somehow manage to create a story regardless of how weak it looked or sounded. Brett Ratner was called back to direct this film that was done 3 years after the first, so the choice is yours, do you think he did a good job? The movie plot stars Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker who respectively reprise their roles as Inspector Lee and Detective Carter.

Of all the exposure this story has received, much of its acclaim may be attributed to its famous 1959 film adaptation, which remains a classic in epic cinema, and a standard Easter holiday favorite.Whether you've heard of Ben Hur or not, chances are good that you've seen this film referenced or mentioned somewhere in pop culture. It stands as one of the biggest, most epic, most ambitious productions in cinema to date. It's most impressive in how it employed thousands of extras, over a million props, and some very expensive and lavish setpieces to bring this larger-than-life tale to life. Even if you aren't marveling at the sheer scope and scale of this film, the chariot race in the film's final act will have you at the edge of your seat. It's a long, uncompromising, real-looking sequence that's still thrilling and intense, and it should stand as one of the best racing scenes of all time. There is a really neat sea battle in the film's first half, which offers even more thrills and violence to behold. For the most part, however, this is a film more heavily built on drama and characterization. Parts of it remain enthralling, as we watch the title character suffer and fight his way through adversity. However, in between the major turning events and the action scenes, the film's momentum does suffer a massive slump. The pacing in certain scenes never agreed with me personally, and is really the only issue I take with this fine picture.The story for this film is perfectly sound and well-built. Judah Ben Hur is a well-rounded character we can follow easily enough and relate to; his rivalry with Messala provides the conflict to drive the plot forward, and digs up some interesting themes of vengeance and hatred. What really propels the film above and beyond will be the story of Christ, running in tandem with Ben Hur's story; both story lines become entwined to reveal strong themes of redemption and salvation. I have no clue how closely this adapts Lew Wallace's original novel, but on its own merits, this film offers a decently insightful story.Captured with a sweeping widescreen frame on a pristine 70mm film stock, this film looks every bit as big as it is. Just about every shot is carefully calculated to best present the imagery with incredible amounts of detail. It uses a lot of long shots, which never felt all that intimate or interesting to me personally, but it is definitely a big-scale picture with lots of impressive shots. Acting is pleasing; Charlton Heston plays Ben Hur with enough nuance and machismo to make the character cool and memorable. The rest of the cast do their best. Writing is not too bad either. This production spares no expense on its massive sets, props, costumes, and visual effects. Music is just as big and ambitious as the rest of the movie is.For its sheer epicness and classic status, this film comes highly recommended.4\/5 (Entertainment Average | Story Very Good | Film Perfect) ","genre":null},{"date":"31 March 2013","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" For more than 100 years, the tale of Ben Hur has staggered the imaginations of audiences worldwide, as indicated by its successful publication history, having at least three different film adaptations, and even a stage play adaptation.

Music is just as big and ambitious as the rest of the movie is.For its sheer epicness and classic status, this film comes highly recommended.4\/5 (Entertainment Average | Story Very Good | Film Perfect) ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, History"},{"date":"31 March 2013","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I want to begin by saying that I watched this film...again...on Easter weekend, and, by coincidence, when I had just learned that MGM is planning a remake.

There's nothing wrong with special effects...they're in all films to some degree or another...but it's getting to the point where so many films focus on the special effects that we are losing the ability to judge fine acting and fine script-writing. I fear the remake of Ben-Hur may end of that way, also -- a special effects extravaganza that will make the new film a shadow of this classic.I mentioned that this is my second-favorite film...just behind Gone With The Wind, and that's partly because each had a superior story, and each was ahead of its time in terms of sheer movie-making. It seems to me that Ben-Hur pretty much has it all, beginning with a superb story (even if you're not a Christian) and a very fine script.And then there's the acting. I'm going to hand out so many kudos here, that I feel I should begin with the one performance that was shallow and so passive as to be nearly worthless -- that of Cathy O'Donnell as Ben-Hur's sister, Tirzah. How bland can an actress get? O'Donnell answered that question definitively. No wonder this was her final film, and that after this she showed up in mostly bit parts on television.Charleton Heston is an actor that I simply can't stand any longer. I won't watch any of his films, with two exceptions The Ten Commandments (because it's hard to resist the spectacle of a Cecil B. DeMille film) and Ben-Hur. As much as I dislike the man because of his political stands, I have to admit that his acting here is absolutely superb and spot-on. His performance as a man who is constantly evolving here, is nothing short of phenomenal. Heston had a few other great performances, but this is the one that stands out and forms the basis of his legacy.We only see Jack Hawkins in on part of the film -- from the battleship to Rome -- but his performance is also right on target. Interestingly, he didn't want to do another spectacle film so soon after Bridge On The River Kwai, which is probably a better role and performance. But he's still excellent here. Incidentally, this film was made shortly after he had gone through cobalt treatments for what eventually turned out to be throat cancer, which killed him at a relatively young age.Haya Harareet was an Israeli actress who only made 9 films in her career. Nevertheless, even aside from her beauty, this film is her finest performance, and I felt worthy of an Oscar nomination.Stephen Boyd also gave his finest performance in this film, and was just right as the selfish and spiteful antagonist. The whole controversy over whether or not he played his role as if he was a jilted gay lover spurned by Ben-Hur is an interesting one, and based on interviews with Gore Vidal.Hugh Girffith is very good as the Arab sheik. Martha Scott is not a well-remembered actress, but I always thought she was very good and very underrated. As Ben-Hur's mother here, she turns in another durable performance. Sam Jaffe is a treasure as Simonides, and this performance rivals his performance as the abbot in 1937's Lost Horizon. I have always enjoyed Finlay Currie's performance as Balthazar in this film, and only recently have been discovering some other fine performances by the Scottish actor (I Know Where I'm Going and People Will Talk). And finally, Frank Thring as Pontius Pilate is terrific.And last but not least -- the spectacle. And a cast of thousands is certainly true here, excellent sets (particularly for the chariot race), and of course -- that chariot race...probably film-making at its finest and most spectacular.This has it all, with few complaints.

Why is it so good? Well for starters, it contains literally everything that was cool about the cinema James Bond in its running time. Charismatic and cool hero? You bet, as Roger Moore turns in his best and one of his most complex interpretations of James Bond. Evil antagonist with an insane, over the top plot? This movie has it in Curt Jurgens genuinely creepy,(even if he was sparsely used)villain who plans to blow up the world, and create a civilization under the sea; it does not get much more over the top than that. Evil henchman? Oh boy this movie delivers there with probably the best one of the whole series with Jaws, who is scary and fearsome in his role (unlike in Moonraker). How about the gadgets and car? They are also among the best with the submersible Lotus Esprit; which is pretty much tied with the DB5 as the best Bond car ever. Is there exotic locations? Yes, Egypt and Sardinia fit the bill nicely. Lastly, and most importantly there are several drop-dead gorgeous women, like Barbara Bach, Valerie Leon, and (my personal favorite actress) Caroline Munro. The Spy Who Loved Me is like a greatest hits collection of Bond, but what pushes the familiar elements over the top is the level of execution, polish, and creativity shown here. There have been ski-chases in the series before, but oh my none of them before or even after have lived up to the jaw-dropping chase and stunt that was in the opening teaser, it perfectly set the tone for the movie as an action packed thrill ride, which it definitely is. There have also been massive conflicts that pit the evil mastermind's forces against the good guys before in the series, but few have ever lived up to the titanic clash in the submarine hold near the end of the film. That is what makes the movie great, everything is bigger, better, and bolder than virtually everything else in the series. Even the story is somewhat familiar, as it hearkens back to You Only Live Twice, but once again it is improved on. The entertainment value in this movie is through the roof with some of the best stunts and fights in the series, and the story itself is good enough to keep the viewer interested until the conclusion. To top it all off this movie has one of the best opening songs in the entire series with Nobody Does It Better, a departure from other songs before this movie in style and name, but it is a beautiful piece that arguably sums up why James Bond is such an awe-inspiring cinema legend for over 50 years This film is just amazing ,and any true fan of the movies will love this piece of classic cinema.

To see this film is to see the death of us all as we slowly degrade from smart ass young men into middle aged denial and finally , fossilized fools. Regardless of whether you are an actual 'used vacuum ' salesmen or we work in a hospital, we are all salespeople to someone and something. All of us play angles and shovel small talk each and every day. As we see the bull crap flying out of these guys mouths, we comfort ourselves that the vulgarity separates us from them and thus we aren't as bad as these guys. Its not about vulgarity or being a salesman. Its about stress. The film holds up a mirror of ourselves under enormous stress and we thank god we very rarely are. The plot in this script is the weakest part. Its too simplistic and shouldn't be able to carry an entire film. Its basically a bunch of guys in a lousy job whose life gets worse to the point of desperation. Each man deals with it in their own way. Just like each on of us deals with our own world , in our own version of heaven or hell, depending on how we view our lives.In this case, these men's lives are versions of hell. Each one is at loathe with themselves and therefore blames everyone and everything around them for their plight. One of them states he wont live in hell of earth, but even he disintegrates into a childish brat whose personal character is nothing like the image he tries to portray. The acting is the movie. It is unbelievably good. Both Alex Baldwin and Jack Lemmon give scenes that rival any they have had in their careers. Al Pacino has been so good in so many movies I cannot tell how good he was in this movie. He was good but by his standards I don't know. Alan Arkin drew the short straw when it came to casting. He had the part of a lovable loser who everyone likes but nobody respects. The most despicable character (besides Baldwin) belongs to Ed Harris. He is brilliant but a bit too loud as David Moss , who is ambitious , frustrated and fed up. But he is no fool. The lucky part goes to Kevin Spacey, who was jumping up and down with utter delight to be selected to be on the same screen as his hero Lemmon , and be considered at such a young age to be able to hold his own with some of the greatest character actors in Hollywood history. It must of rubbed off on young Spacey, as his mediocre performance in this film would springboard into academy award winning roles in several films after wards, making himself into an acting legend in his own right. Unlike most of Hollywood, this film has no hero, no real villain and no justice in the end. Its what we see every day. Ordinary people wishing they were somewhere else and someone else. Regular folks making bad decisions, and wallowing in the consequences. The movie left me feeling so much gratitude for the little integrity I was lucky enough to maintain in my own life.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"31 March 2013","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" This film based on a critically acclaimed play is one of the most real films I have ever seen. It shows the underbelly of who we are as people but do not want to admit. To see this film is to see the death of us all as we slowly degrade from smart ass young men into middle aged denial and finally , fossilized fools. Regardless of whether you are an actual 'used vacuum ' salesmen or we work in a hospital, we are all salespeople to someone and something. All of us play angles and shovel small talk each and every day. As we see the bull crap flying out of these guys mouths, we comfort ourselves that the vulgarity separates us from them and thus we aren't as bad as these guys. Its not about vulgarity or being a salesman. Its about stress. The film holds up a mirror of ourselves under enormous stress and we thank god we very rarely are. The plot in this script is the weakest part. Its too simplistic and shouldn't be able to carry an entire film. Its basically a bunch of guys in a lousy job whose life gets worse to the point of desperation. Each man deals with it in their own way. Just like each on of us deals with our own world , in our own version of heaven or hell, depending on how we view our lives.In this case, these men's lives are versions of hell. Each one is at loathe with themselves and therefore blames everyone and everything around them for their plight. One of them states he wont live in hell of earth, but even he disintegrates into a childish brat whose personal character is nothing like the image he tries to portray. The acting is the movie. It is unbelievably good. Both Alex Baldwin and Jack Lemmon give scenes that rival any they have had in their careers. Al Pacino has been so good in so many movies I cannot tell how good he was in this movie. He was good but by his standards I don't know. Alan Arkin drew the short straw when it came to casting. He had the part of a lovable loser who everyone likes but nobody respects. The most despicable character (besides Baldwin) belongs to Ed Harris. He is brilliant but a bit too loud as David Moss , who is ambitious , frustrated and fed up. But he is no fool.

This is before stripping its resources bearer still for the very final few dozen minutes when further dynamics and characters are removed thus killing it off even more. One senses Bertolucci should have pulled the plug earlier than he did, some time before we're left with hanging shots of the intense African desert and those that inhabit it; the likes of whom the lone central character still left in the film falls in with, someone who then somewhat oddly comes to find a degree of liberation once this has happened. It isn't a bad film by any means, quite the opposite. For the most time, it's engrossing; a film about a relationship being strained and tested in an equally testing climate and locale, but when it decides to remove its love rival to this central tryst, the thematic flags; when the comic relief is removed in equal turn, Bertolucci is no longer able to demonstrate his acute ability to switch from tone to tone. The film falls as a result; the performances take over, the thing becomes an acting piece more-so a directorial piece the marriage has been studied, played out and depicted - what we're left with is not as interesting.The scenario of matrimony in question is shared between Americans Port and Kit Moresby, played respectively by John Malkovich and Debra Winger. They are two people who arrive in a dusty, French speaking North African nation by boat from, what we assume from the use of found footage during the immediate opening, the city of New York. They do not see themselves as tourists in as much they see themselves travellers, but such a challenging of a specific definition between two things, of which may as well mean the same thing anyway, essentially sets up the gradual unravelling of the marriage via the same intrinsic thing the ambiguity over the definitions of whether Port and Kit any longer enjoy one another's presence. They are visiting this place with a friend called George Turner (Scott), a man whose presence threatens to wreck the Moresby's time here in so much Kit appears to take to him and Port is mostly suspicious of them as a pair.Propping up proceedings is a middle-aged Englishman named Eric (Spall), who's in and around our centred triangle with his mother, played by Jill Bennett a professional travels guide writer and comic relief Spain! she bellows. Nothing but soldiers, priests and Jews! Upon arrival, the Moresby's attempt to create share sort of intimacy is ruined when Kit brings up Turner and speaks well of his features. Things are not aided during this early awkward time when the general intimacy of the hotel is as prominent as it is, and Port feels the need to frequent a sex worker out of his frustrations born out of Kit's actions. Further distrust appears when both individuals take differing routes to a new hotel, a place to stay deeper still into this territory which gradually becomes more and more barren and away from any sort of urban congregation. Their scenes of philosophising and love making play out to a musical score consisting of a drum more broadly resembling a funeral death march, reiterating the potential their bond has to wreck itself.There is genuine room to enjoy the film as this piece of cinema depicting a love triangle as those involved trek across the unforgiving Saharan desert, and Bertolucci does well to correlate the people doing the mileage as the marriage itself struggles with the burden. There isn't much behind revealing that Turner and Kit do indeed connect with one another to an extent that would be thoroughly detrimental to any marriage should what transpire transpires here. The suspicions and such Port has for these two never explodes into anything overtly melodramatic, in fact we enjoy the film's maintain of it as this simmering object never allowing for immediate, obligatory dramatic resolution as one party goes mad at another over things we're already aware of for meek domestic, dramatic kicks; something that would render it more reminiscent of a soap opera than this sweeping, period set, a million-miles-from-home desert-based piece.Later on, when Turner is removed from the film, the weight of this distrust and anxiety can only carry the film for so long. As mentioned, one senses the film wearing out its welcome as thematic and dramatic concentration are substituted for a more wandering; less congealed procession of sweeping Saharan compositions and the strength of the performances. Bertolucci's direction is assured; someone who really grounds out this atmosphere wherein events are moving slowly and we trudge through this hot, lazy place with this marriage additionally appearing to do likewise; this is without the film ever really feeling as if it too is doing the same.

A peculiar group of people rent the property to store boulder-like objects they take from the bottom of the ocean. As such, the pool acquires healing powers and restore's the old folk's youthful vigor, to say the least.Steve Guttenberg stars as the likable protagonist, the boat owner\/operator who helps the people get to the objects in the ocean, but he has no idea what's really going on. The stunning Tahnee Welch -- Raquel's daughter -- plays one the members of the peculiar group to whom Guttenberg takes a liking. Unlike Raquel, who's known for being a bit biyatchy, Tahnee shines with a winsome disposition. Brian Dennehy is also on hand as the leader of the odd group, and he does very well.Most great movies have a deeper subtext, and so it is with Cocoon. The story is a commentary on aging, death, grieving and the yearning for eternal life. The people of the peculiar group are types of angels or, better yet, the redeemed in glorified bodies. What they offer is the gospel, the key to eternal life in the new heavens and new earth, the home of righteousness (2 Peter 313). By the redeemed in glorified bodies I'm referring to the glorious bodies that are promised to believers at the time of their bodily resurrection (1 Cor. 1542-44); these bodies will be imperishable, powerful and spiritual (not carnal) in nature. Believers will be able to defy gravity with these new bodies, walk through doors and teleport from one place to another, all of which can be seen in Jesus Christ after his resurrection.Needless to say, Cocoon has an incredible subtext. But it's not necessary to get so deep. This is just an entertaining movie with a good heart. More than that, it's inspiring.The film runs 117 minutes and was shot in the Clearwater\/St. Petersburg area of Florida and the underwater scenes in the Bahamas.GRADE A ","genre":null},{"date":"31 March 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I haven't seen Ron Howard's Cocoon (1985) for about twenty years and am so glad I purchased it recently.On the surface the film's about elderly folks at a retirement home in Florida unknowingly discovering the fountain of youth via a pool on an adjacent property.

The stunning Tahnee Welch -- Raquel's daughter -- plays one the members of the peculiar group to whom Guttenberg takes a liking. Unlike Raquel, who's known for being a bit biyatchy, Tahnee shines with a winsome disposition. Brian Dennehy is also on hand as the leader of the odd group, and he does very well.Most great movies have a deeper subtext, and so it is with Cocoon. The story is a commentary on aging, death, grieving and the yearning for eternal life. The people of the peculiar group are types of angels or, better yet, the redeemed in glorified bodies. What they offer is the gospel, the key to eternal life in the new heavens and new earth, the home of righteousness (2 Peter 313). By the redeemed in glorified bodies I'm referring to the glorious bodies that are promised to believers at the time of their bodily resurrection (1 Cor. 1542-44); these bodies will be imperishable, powerful and spiritual (not carnal) in nature. Believers will be able to defy gravity with these new bodies, walk through doors and teleport from one place to another, all of which can be seen in Jesus Christ after his resurrection.Needless to say, Cocoon has an incredible subtext. But it's not necessary to get so deep. This is just an entertaining movie with a good heart. More than that, it's inspiring.The film runs 117 minutes and was shot in the Clearwater\/St. Petersburg area of Florida and the underwater scenes in the Bahamas.GRADE A ","genre":"Sci-Fi"},{"date":"31 March 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I haven't seen Ron Howard's Cocoon (1985) for about twenty years and am so glad I purchased it recently.On the surface the film's about elderly folks at a retirement home in Florida unknowingly discovering the fountain of youth via a pool on an adjacent property.

The terminator as he's called, hilariously played by Arnold Schwarzenegger turns up out of the blue, stark naked but ready for action. After callously beating up a group of friends in a bar, stealing their clothes and motorbike he's off to find his mentor John. John who is abnormal, mentally bullies the terminator whilst also teaching him some childish phrases. The relationship takes an unexpected twist with the arrival of a further robot however this one is intent on harming John. Slowly we learn of John's unusual up bringing and we also meet his mother, who is a thin maniac. After several hilarious attempts at John's life both robots begin to see John in a different light leading to a confrontation at some kind of foundry, the terminator sacrificing himself, wrongly seeing himself as responsible for the deaths of John's foster parents. Full marks to both robots for making this a cracking yarn and taking the attention off John who was frankly annoying.
