However, they have real chemistry when they are surrounded by nymphomaniacs.Acting Only John Cleese shines in every single one of his scenes, which are too few.  Sure, it is a rehash of his Fawlty Towers character, and it seems totally Pythonesque, but he always makes it work. However, Hawn and Martin have never seemed worse than in this movie.  They only click in a couple of scenes, and they only clash in a couple of others.  The rest of the screen time together is exactly that, they see each other, but as friends, not as lovers, and so their tempers and emotions never quite go to extremes because they realize that they are just acting.  Good actors become their roles, or at least seem like it.  The only times that they really click is the scene after the mugging, and the scene with the nymphomaniacs.  Otherwise, they are just blah.

I think that Hollywood needs to make new movies, not adapt movies from novels, plays, or especially OTHER MOVIES. How blah and unoriginal.This is a movie that appeals to older folks, and is aimed at the lowest common denominator.  However, the old folks feel insulted, and the LCD goes to see movies that are better like Star Wars, The Matrix, and Go, all of which were much better than this movie.  I have seen teens of the LCD buy tickets to this movie and see another.  I have also seen teens skip buying tickets to this movie to sneak in to another, in case they are forced to watch this drivel.  But, see this movie for what not to do, and for John Cleese.

In describing what's good about it, well, it's hard to do so without simply copying other reviews.The special effects are impressive, not so much for their flashiness and so-on.  You CAN achieve that without CG and the like.  The thing I liked was that this was the first time I've seen such consistent use of CG that doesn't advertise itself as such.  The fact that such work was put into this movie for the sole purpose of hiding the tell-tale  markers of CG was impressive.  Other, previous movies have made use of the new effects technology, but there was always little signs; like the black border around such characters and the like that you simply couldn't ignore them.  SWE1 melded real-life and computer generated life wonderfully.Aside from the effects, the movie had other merits, McGregor has done a bang-up job capturing the essense of Guinness' Kenobi while providing a glimpse of that same character as a head-strong apprentice Jedi.  We can see the Obi-Wan to be in Ewan's acting.  The other characters are portrayed well, even young Anakin although as an old Star Wars fan it's difficult to see the Vader to be, but there's time and two episodes to go.  Darth Maul's battle scenes were truly awe-inspiring bringing a real sense of battle that was slightly lacking in IV-VI.Otherwise, Maul was disappointing.  Previews, trailers, and yes, hype made Maul out to be a larger villain than he turned out to be.  He ended up little more than a henchman and not much of a menace (although I suspect the movie's name sake was meant to be Palpatine more than Maul). Nevertheless, Darth Maul hardly seemed worthy of the Darth title.As for other points, the movie is fun, but you can definitely see the influence of parenthood on Lucas in this episode.  George admitted this movie would be geared more towards children this time and such intent is understandable considering his own children.  However, I think he underestimated the intelligence of today's children, unless he was aiming for the pre-school bunch.  The Gungan's simply couldn't be taken seriously at all with Jar-Jar's annoyingly cute bumbling and the incessant mugging of the Gungan leader.  Humour in the previous movies was subtle, but hardly out of the grasp of even children in their first decade.  TPM seemed to rely more on obvious physical comedy that just looked out of place in the Star Wars universe.If the last paragraphs made you think I didn't like SWE1TPM, sorry, I enjoyed it a lot although I'm somewhat biased being a fan from my first big screen experience when A New Hope was simply Star Wars.  Hopefully though, Lucas listens to the fans when he puts together the next two movies. Ignore the professional critics.  Any criticism from them is simply a few sad sacks hedging their bets in case this movie doesn't do well so they can say I told you so.  Reviews like the ones found here on IMDB are from the real people who actually shelled out their own hard earned cash and Lucas has claimed that's who he's interested in.I still have hope for the two episodes to come.

Being the 291st user, these words will probably be buried in the sea of fans of the force who have expressed their kinda or not so kinda words on the latest George Lucas saga.After much anticipation, and of course one of those who purchased their tickets in advance and waiting an hour to get into the theatre (note I wasn't one of those who waited 2 weeks in line - there's something called ordering by phone ordering, isn't technology grand?), I must say I was a bit disappointed by the outcome.For those who have studied OB (not Kenobi - Organizational Behaviour), you may be well aware of the term innovation. A company can go either be incremental or drastic.  A company can take a drastic change by creating something new and phenomenal or seek improvement on existing products. Ultimately, the latter is the least expensive.

Those ILM guys can basically do anything, reaching new heights again and again.  No wonder Lucas is a $2 billion man.  However, the disappointment comes in with Lucas the Storyteller as he so delicately put himself.  Episode I seems to play as a larger version of the 4,5 and 6 combined.  What seems to be most disappointing was the ending, which gives the audience a total sense of deja vu.  For those 2 of you that have not seen the movie yet, please stop reading.1) Anakin Skywalker in his fighter, battling it out ferociously in space with R2D2 in the back.  He finally destroys the Trade Federation Control ship.  Obviously, this is a rip off of old Episode IV A New Hope, where an elaborate battle scene shows Luke and rebel forces' quest to destroy the death star.  The difference lies in that Anakin's attempt was accidentally. I guess it's a case of like father like son.2) The battle scene between Darth Maul and the Jedi Master along with his apprentice.  The scenery itself much resembles the one that was used in the last 15 minutes of Empire.  Even at the end where young Obi-Wan clings to his life resembles what Luke had to do at the end.  Except, Luke had his poor arm chopped off of course, while Darth got chopped off into two pieces.3) The death of Qui-Gon Jinn (told you not to read on) resembles much of how the old Kenobi died, with the young apprentice screaming NOOOOO!!!.  Is this a sign?  Has Kenobi foreseen his death?  Is that why he vanishes into the air, while Master Jinn's body needs to be burnt.  These are some things only Lucas and Voda can explain to us.  Perhaps, next episode.4) Finally, the terrific idea of destroying the control ship.  Hmmm, what were Luke, Leia and others trying to do in the moon of Endor? Yes, that's right.  Destroy the shield generator that protects the second Death Star. You see, there's always a generator or some kind of control unit around. If you can find it and destroy it, you can go home and celebrate, but of course not live happily ever after .. otherwise there wouldn't be room for an episode.For those whose who are hard core Star Wars fans, this would play as another visually stunning, brainless eye candy.  Much would probably go see it again and again, but the hype will eventually be tuned down as one learns the true meaning of the force - a multi-million dollar vehicle that makes you purchase anything that is remotely related to Star Wars...  Yes, the force can be purchased for $1.99 at Taco Bell, And of course, driving us to believe that we must own everything having to do with Star Wars is the ultimate Jedi mind trick.

It doesn't have that relentless dependence on events that so many Hollywood movies have. The delight is in watching the responses of these rich, beautifully drawn characters to life as it unfolds around them. I enjoyed Lily Tomlin's performance very much and Cher didn't ruin the movie for me (she did for my husband) though I couldn't help noticing how much less expressive her nipped & tucked features were, compared to the beauty of Judi, Joan & Maggie. The vision of the ladies protecting the towers toward the end, their proper English attire bedraggled & dusty, made me weep and will stay with me for some time. No, this isn't the Saving Private Ryan look at WWII, but surely there's room for different perspectives & I don't think looking at them - and laughing at them - in ANY way diminishes the importance of the lives sacrificed in a war. On the contrary, it enriches our understanding of the horrors of war to see the power of the human spirit, like we also saw in Life is Beautiful, and to get a glimpse of some of the ways of life that the war threatened to or did destroy - however trivial they may seem.It's sad to read how many users seemed to be saying Why should we care what happens to a bunch of snotty old ladies. I'd suggest that they do a little research and stick to the plethora of movies about over-sexed 17-year-olds. God knows, there are enough of them.

And while this one fills the void somewhat, I would be lying to say that I wasn't disappointed. While the much-touted fx are quite extravagant, Lucas glops it on, like so much computer-generated katsup, covering up the gaping hole created by a thin story & even thinner characters.  As usual, everything in the Star Wars universe is shown in black and white you are either good or evil, no shades in between, no complex characters or motivations that complicate real life, where on occasion good people perform evil deeds, etc.  No, that would take too much effort to show.  The bad characters are obviously, irredeemably bad, and are made-up to show it, while the good characters are flawlessly good.  While I liked the scenes showing the planets, but didn't care much for the people who inhabited them - the Naboo are obviously the white people, and they are rather bland and vanilla; the leathery Gronks (sp?) are the dark people, and are given a horrifying accent & exaggerated movements; the Trade Federation people seem only interested in money & have pretty obvious oriental accents.  I'm not sure what Lucas is trying to say here, but it seems fairly sophmoric.  Let's get one thing fairly clear here Ja'r Ja'r, or whatever the hell his name is, is a constant irritation & obvious plot device.  He's worse than that annoying little kid that ruined Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom.  And while we're at it, Anakin Skywalker is pretty irritating too, although that maybe partially blamed on a weak script and some pretty amateurish acting.  Liam Neeson & Ewan McGregor are both fine, especially McGregor, whom we hope has more to do and say in the next picture. Natalie Portman trys to overcome the shortcomings of the script, and that's good for something I guess.  The fight scenes with Darth Mol are very good; I wish moore had been shown - except what's up with the orange laser door thing??  Too many things happen for no explainable reason; these poorly masked plot devices which are used to push the moovie along manage to drain much of the energy of the film.  This is especially true of The Force, the supreme deus ex machina which allows the good characters to get away with practically anything, no matter how ludicrously far-fetched. This moovie also finally shows something even more useless than imperial stormtroopers the Republic battle 'droids.  These pathetic metal fodder spend the entire moovie shooting their little laser guns, hitting nothing, and getting decimated by everything.  As a matter of fact, Naboo is invaded and involved in a war, but you'd never know because almost no one dies, there is no blood, and the only ones who get killed are the poor battle 'droids - but it's ok because they are robots, and they don't count, so bring yer kiddies so we can sell moore toys.  Yes, this sounds a bit cynical, because this could have been a great, mammoth moovie, if only Lucas had put some time and effort into telling a good story with well-rounded characters, instead of loading up the eye-candy.  But if you liked Independence Day or Armageddon, ie see shiney things go boom, chances are you'll love this as well.  I think die-hard Star Wars fans will be disappointed at the lack of depth.

I knew that I would probably be very disappointed with it.I was NOT!!I must tell you that what other people have said negatively about this movie (that Jar Jar is hard to understand and that he is annoying, that the acting of all the major characters is a total bore, and that Lucas has overdone the CGI), I found NONE of them to be true.I loved the fact that a new character named Qui Gon Jin (Liam Neeson) had the most important role in the movie, more so than Obi Wan (Ewan McGregor) did.  In my opinion, this is necessary as we had to know more of Obi Wan's beginnings and who trained him before we can fully understand and appreciate the upcoming conflicts that will grow between Obi Wan and his first apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, in the next two movies.It's no easy task for a director to pull this off since everyone in the theater already knows the eventual outcome of these two ill-fated 'heroes'.Yes, the special effects in this movie are fantastic, as are the art work, sound and costumes.  Every aspect of this production is top-notch!  It definitely has Lucas written all over it!Simply a great Overture to the Star Wars saga!!!Oh, and one last thing....The CGI character of Jar Jar Binks is no more difficult to understand than was Yoda the first time we were all introduced to him back in 1980.  Just like Yoda, it took a little time to get used to his voice and dialect. Jar Jar doesn't take away from this film at all!

Lucas had twenty years to write the script and this is the best he could do?This movie doesn't feel right.  The climax of Independence Day is exciting, the actors, music, etc. suggesting this is for all the marbles. Even in the climax for PM, I never got that Here we go! feeling.Like in ROTJ and NH Special Edition, there is an abundance of slapstick gags totally at odds with a story about intergalactic civil war.  The characters do not behave realistically.  Why would the robot soldiers tell each other orders?  Wouldn't they communicate with each other in binary, like a modem?  And if I see one more movie where the plan to capture the bad guy involves the heroes travelling a secret underground passage that no one else knows of, I'm going to be sick.Also, the light saber battles threw me.  Yes, they looked cool, and I liked how Darth Maul used the Force to open a door without letting down his guard.  But the fights are styled like martial arts swordfights, not the classic fencing from NH, ESB, and ROTJ.  It's inconsistent.On the bright side, the special effects are sweet, the pod race being genuinely thrilling.  The long shots of the architecture are amazing, like something Rand and Robyn Miller would dream up.  John William's music isn't workmanlike this time, it actually invokes the scenes.It all comes down to how much detail you pay to Star Wars.  Casual viewers will love its eye candy.  True fans who sensed a disturbance in the Force with the Ewoks in ROTJ know what they are in for.

Star Wars is indubitably one of Earth's greatest treasures of the 20th century.  From the first Star Wars in 1977 to the last of the first trilogy in 1984, Lucas has proven himself to be among the greatest film artists in history.  I, for one, had great expectation in the latest episode of his space saga.  However, this one--The Phantom Menace--though with outlandish CGI special effects and superstar casts, lacks the glory that the previous three SW films have left behind.All I can say about the greatness of this movie is the special effects. Nothing else.  Sorry.First, I'd like to criticize Lucas' inaptitude in script-writing.  There are many obvious faux-pas lines that ruin the show. (e.g. Jar Jar Binks You sa you sa...people are gonna die-ei?,  Anakin Skywalker Mom, you said the problem of the universe is that nobody helps each other. followed by long pause, Obi-wan Kenobi I have a bad feeling about this.)Dude, what the hell?  I'd prefer these lines not to be uttered at all. There is absolutely no immediate need for them to be expressed, dammit!Second, one character I really hated Jar Jar Binks.  If he were there to substitute Chewbacca, I'd say, Damn, George, bring back the growling, rifle-shooting, sound-and-fury Wookie!!  In TPM, JJB is not shy to demonstrate his clumsiness at any time.  His stupid, unheroic appearance in the movie only makes the flick worse.  Indeed, he has introduced many comical elements into the film, but damn, man, this is SW!  It's not supposed to be a Disney film!  We don't need to see his tripping and fumbling during the battle scene.  It totally ruins the intensity.Third, Anakin Skywalker as a Christ figure.  Okay, as we all are well aware of, young Anakin will eventually emerge as the dark lord known as Darth Vader.  If Lucas is aware of that Anakin is the ultimate bad guy of the galaxy, why would he illustrate him as the savior???  Born from immaculate conception, protagonist of the chariot (pod) race??  Maybe I'm a little slow, but I don't remember that, in the Bible, Jesus will turn to the dark side.Fourth, Ewan McGregor.  When I watched him in Trainspotting, I immediately realized this dude can be no less than the protagonist of any film.  But here in TPM, he's a yes-man, lap dog; his brilliance is completely hidden behind his master, played by the poise Liam Nieeson.  Only until the very last scene is Ewan standing alone and exuberating the Jedi power.  What a waste of him in the first episode.Fifth, the accidental saving the day.  Anakin, again, a 9-year-old kid with supernatural power (Jedi potential), by chance goes hiding inside the fighter plane canopy.  He, by chance, activates the plane, by chance, wipes out the formidable obstacles, by chance, flys to the space, by chance, participates in the outer space dog-fight, by chance, lands inside the Trade Federation's space station, by chance, fires at a crucial spot that subsequently destroys the entire space station; he, by chance, is the savior of the day.  You gotta do better than that, Lucas.Sixth, ground battle.  The primitive Gungans vs. the high-tech equipped Trade Federation armies.  Surprisingly enough, the Gungans receive the ultimate victory in the battle.  Man, what are the odds?  And the clumsy JJB survives the lazer cross-firing battlefield.  One of the lamest scenes is that when JJB accidentally diabled a TF robot, from which his leg gets entangled with, and in attempt to get rid of the clinging robot, he accidentally kills three more TF robots (for the robot on his leg fires at the TF robots whenever he flings his leg).  All I can say is WTF.I'm tired of counting the no-goods for this movie.  Nevertheless, I'm amazed how the movie technology has created such eye-popping effects in this movie, which is really exhilarating.  I give this credit to Lucas and all the crew in Lucasfilm.  They really deserve this.I'm sure many of you die-hard SW fans beg to differ, and might want to kill me in the next 24 hours.  Fortunately, I'm scrupulous enough not to include my email address here with my comment.  Haha...
