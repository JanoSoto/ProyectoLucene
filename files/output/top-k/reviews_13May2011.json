It is dramatic like a lot of parts that Robin Williams has been playing for many years now in efforts to win awards etc instead of just doing crazy comedies, but there are also a lot of funny parts in it and the drama is not hitting you over the head too much even though it is about very serious subjects like sick kids who are passing away from terrible diseases. There are unexpected parts that I won't spoil and touching parts and also parts that are very funny, like Robin Williams talking with and entertaining the sick children.
