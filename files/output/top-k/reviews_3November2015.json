So it's long. As I've noticed from many viewers' criticisms, the slow pacing comes up. What hinders Solaris for me is not that it's necessarily slow-paced, but some of the shots, like the notorious car scene, are just...I don't know. Yes, I realize Tarkovsky is trying to create atmosphere&#x97;which he is a master of, but maybe this movie just was not for me.One has to truly be in the right mindset to sit down and watch this beast start to finish. While watching this movie, I thought wow, this is beautiful, and in the next scene I would just think how pointless that scene seemed. Tarkovsky's films are all like this; I actually preferred Stalker because I felt that Tarkovsky's drawn out pacing and attention to the beauty of nature worked better for that story.This is one of the most unique films I've seen in a while. I don't think many modern directors would, or even could, make a film like Tarkovsky did. Solaris can put the viewer into a truly reflective state with its slow, quiet scenes.Here's another element that bugged me though the lack of sound. This film is extremely quiet; I'm not a fan of such a lack of sound. I much preferred Eraserhead's buzzing, ambient noise over Solaris' blankness.Solaris' story has been said to be a great look into the human condition, which I agree with on paper. The acting is pretty amazing, but the characters and the writing are nothing special. The way the story was told in the film just did not appeal to me&#x97;but like I said before, those in the right mindset to watch this film would be delighted.

In addition, if you're not able to take a third sports action drama, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Rocky III (1982) is definitely tied best Rocky film with IV. The first one will always be the best. I think the third entry of the franchise is a big improvement over Rocky II in my opinion. He's on top of the world now, bags a statue, and for some reason, Adrian became attractive in this one. Like, REALLY attractive. He got soft, he got arrogant, and he got lazy. He lost his trainer, his title, and most of all, his self-respect to one of the most that makes me angry villains ever to grace the silver screen Mr. T's Oscar-robbed performance as Clubber Lang and had to regain the 'eye of the tiger' to get it all back in front of the world. This one also proves further that Apollo Creed is human. Guy went from an arrogant prick and sore loser to Rocky's finest ally. Kudos, Carl. I love Mr. T he become famous after this movie there is also Hulk Hogan in it. Adrian in this movie is very supportive and I love Apollo how he was helping Rocky. Rocky III has a heart beside Rocky I.Why I love this film? This is the only Rocky film in which Adrian is well written - to further support my stance that III fires on all cylinders. Really, what purpose does Adrian serve in II, IV and V? She spends most of those movies telling Rocky not to fight - she is not supportive and just a burden to him. In this one, she actually encourages him and is an asset (speach on the beach.) Heck, there wouldn't be much of Rocky II if not for her objections to. It is the best all around Rocky movie. On a literary level (story), entertainment level, filmmaking level, boxing choreography, characters, etc... The fight at the end actually means something for Rocky. He has something to gain from it (unlike V.) This and Rocky I are the ONLY two Rocky movies where Adrian actually encourages Rocky the whole time (unlike II, IV, and V.) Mr. T is perfectly cast. It was so successful because it was the best. Rocky lost everything his manager, his title, his self respect and mostly he lost his edge! Like Apollo said Now, when we fought, you had that eye of the tiger, man; the edge! And now you gotta get it back, and the way to get it back is to go back to the beginning. That's what I love. When you lose something don't quit. You need gained back the thing you lost. I love how Apollo motivated Rocky in this film and I think Apollo is well written and portrayed in here. I seriously I think Carl Weathers did a wonderful job portraying arrogant Apollo to an awesome Rocky's friend, to a support and ally. I was surprised Apollo was back in the third entry of the Series franchise. I love the training sequences and the music Score by Bill Conti the same score he used in Rocky I, and II. The same year that Sylvester Stallone made Rocky III the same year he went and started in First Blood, his famous role to this days Rambo! Carl Weathers also said that Rocky III is his favorite film he made. Not only that it is the only Rocky sequel film who won another Oscar award, which is the only one. Beside Carl Weathers I think Mr. T was the best actor portraying a villain in this movie I love how he provoked Rocky I really love that. This is the only film the lasted three rounds. The film has two fight with Clubber Lang (Mr. T) and more fights in which Rocky and Clubber are attending too in the opening scene. Rocky fights a wrestler Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) in this film. I also love the music score Eye of the Tiger performed by Survivor! I love this film it is my second best favorite rocky film alongside with Rocky I. The rating I am giving is 9.5\/10, I would have give it 10, I didn't because Mickey dies in this film and that was the most shocking disturbing scene to me. Three years and 10 successful title defenses after beating Apollo Creed, with whom he has become great friends, a now wealthy Rocky Balboa is considering retirement. Fame and complacency soon cause Balboa to lose his title to Clubber Lang, who inadvertently causes the death of Rocky's trainer Mickey. Rocky sinks into a depression, and Apollo decides to train Rocky for a rematch against Lang so Rocky can try to win the title back. That is the basic main plot.

But with the subject being mainly corruption and the theme redemption with an unlikeable character I find it understandable. I myself love this movie since I am into heavy stuff that makes me think and fill me with dread. This movie manages both if you ask me. I feel it is such a strong movie with some existential philosophy about a corrupt man starting to feel guilt about his life. Leading to his quest for redemption. The story plays out well, showing our main character's irresponsible ways ranging from gambling, drug abuse, taking bribes to harassing young women. I think it is such a tragic movie. The director certainly did a great job if you ask me, considering the hard subject he did his job quite thoughtfully making the story and plot convincing. Leading to a movie in my opinion one of the best tragedies ever put on film.Now Harvey Keitel is an actor I have the utmost respect for. I have yet to see a bad movie he has been in. He often plays roles that are hard to play and where most actors tend to slip a Little in playing their characters, I think Harvey often does his job strongly and convincingly. I imagine if another actor tried to do what Harvey did in this movie many actors would have made the character laughable instead of uncomfortable, pitiful and convincing. He is a subtle actor even in his most outrageous roles, also quite graceful. This movie is no exception in his acting. I could relate to his character, even though he was such an amoral character with very few redeeming qualities. I only feel this way to a few actors and just to name a few like Gary Oldman, Denzel Washington, Al Pacino and Michael Caine (I didn't write them all since it isn't about them). So yes, I am very fond of Harvey Keitel. He is a rare talent that doesn't get much recognition. But he is a professional and he keeps his life private which I respect even more.This is a thought provoking movie where the audience has to take part in the Lieutenant's life which is a corrupt life. It has a simple plot in which the Lieutenant is trying to find the rapists of a nun and find redemption. The story is good in which it perfectly shows how corrupt our Lieutenant is and it is full of subtleties where the Lieutenant even though harsh and corrupt, hides a good man that went wrong ways with wrong decisions. Oh and the existential part? The lieutenant is looking for redemption and try to do one good thing in order to forgive himself, what can be more existential than that? Trying to find meaning to his life which he has been wasting a lot. What a waste his life was by the way. After each time I watch the movie I begin to feel grateful for my dull life, because although it is dull I haven't sunken as deep as the Lieutenant. So in my opinion this is a movie that has to be watched again and again. Although it doesn't fall into everyone's taste. It is a hard movie to watch after all.

Aladdin is beloved by me along with millions of others and it will be loved by many more with this new Diamond DVD. Aladdin has so many jokes that it makes you laugh, but also has quite a few dramatic scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat with relationships sprouting into wonderful romance. And, it is all wrapped together in one fantastic adventure.The story begins when a Middle Eastern princess decides she had enough of being stuck in her palace and goes out into the city for once in her life. She goes to the market and gets in a little bit of trouble, thanks to a poor young man named Aladdin. Sadly, he is accused of kidnapping the princess. Now in jail, he and another man manage to escape to go find a massive treasure and most importantly - a Genie bottle. The Genie (our favorite Robin Williams) comes out and grants Aladdin three wishes - now Aladdin can decide what he wants to do.Aladdin is such a fantastic and entertaining film. The animation is just mind blowing. How good it is, considering that it was made over 20 years ago, how full of emotion the voice actors ate, it is quite different than many other famous Disney animations. With such a famous cast, it is truly a masterpiece. And, quite nostalgic to hear Robin Williams' so recognizable voice as this is one of his most iconic roles. It really shows how he entertained the world with laughter for so many years. The soundtrack in Aladdin is incredible. Each song is catchy and kind of gets stuck in your head (I will show you the woooorld!) and so many of them are now classic songs that people of different generations sing.This special Diamond edition of Aladdin comes with quite a few bonus features. In one of my favorites, conversations with the casts, I found out a lot of interesting facts such as Scott Weinger, the voice of Aladdin, actually didn't know how to sing when he auditioned for it at the age of 15! There are also several deleted scenes, showing how different they originally planned the film and even a deleted song that was done by Jafar, (Jonathon Freeman)!My favorite scene is when Aladdin releases Genie for the first time and he quickly gets out of his small bottle (he is rather big). I love his first line, 10,000 years will give you such a crick in the neck! I love this scene because instead of ranting about something, he just does his first line as a pretty funny joke, which forever brought this lovable special character into our lives.Aladdin has something similar to the other Disney animated films in that they are meant for the whole family. So, I recommend it for ages 7 to 18. I wouldn't show it to kids younger than seven because there are a few dramatic scenes that might be frightening for then. It isn't exactly bright and fun throughout the whole film. I give it five out of five stars because this is truly a classic and I love every aspect of it, especially our wonderful Genie who we miss every day.Reviewed by Gerry O. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

If you want to enjoy this film, you have to meet Jeffery The Dude Lebowski by his terms, hang out with him and his bowling buddies and follow them at a their (perhaps somewhat leisurely) pace through this weird and unbelievable tale about nihilism, theft (of a car and, more importantly a Creedence Clearwater Revival tape), kidnapping, abstract art, porn and - of course - bowling. The story is actually kind of simple. You see, some no-good German nihilists urinated on The Dude's rug - and this kind of aggression just won't stand against The Dude. With the help of his bowling buddies, he will do everything in his power to get someone to pay for his rug - or possibly get a new one (because that rug really tied the room together). So he embarks on this worthy quest during which he will encounter many wondrous things and fascinating people (even Jesus - who is NOT the messiah but a very naughty man).With Jeff Bridges in the leading role, the Coen brothers have found the perfect actor to incorporate one of the most iconic characters that has ever been created. But it's not just The Dude that makes this a winner; the whole film is such an inspired folly and simply inventive filmmaking at its finest (the hilarious dream sequence alone is worth the price of admission).

It was back in 1995, in the movie theaters. Man, that was 20-years ago. I have seen a couple of scenes from the movie since then, but I haven't seen the movie the whole way through. Though, I can still remember some of it from back then. It obviously wasn't a movie I cared to see again, because often times I think of the movies you really like are movies you'd want to see again. Some kids watch the same movie everyday Interestingly, as an adult another movie I left a review on which I remember renting 2-years ago and enjoying enough to watch it 3 nights in a row after renting it and immediately bought a copy and regularly go through scenes is a movie called Junior High Spy.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is a childhood memory of mine. I went from being obsessed with Power Rangers to no longer caring about them. I stopped watching the show after the second season which was mostly when the show seemed to lose it's popularity. I mean I remember seeing so many kids dressed up in school as Power Rangers during the Halloween of 1994. But, the year after I only remember one kid dressed in a Power Rangers costume. I wasn't aware what was going on with the show during the 3rd Season. I think it's interesting how I went from being obsessed with that show to no longer really caring about them.I feel like the show went downhill during the second half of Season 2, around the time 3 rangers left. I think most of us preferred the original 3 over their replacements. I also started to realize as a kid that the show became predictable and even though Lord Zedd was supposed to be superior over Rita, more of his monsters were taken down more easily than Rita's. The show just stopped appealing to me as a kid, and I imagined coming up with my own plots.Many years later, I'd watch Zyuranger and buy the episodes on DVD. Man, I didn't know Power Rangers was from a Japanese TV show at the time. Watching Zyuranger I can't believe that I'm watching something older than the Power Rangers and what inspired it. I like a lot of you think Zyuranger is a better T.V. show and better done than Power Rangers. It wasn't common knowledge back then like it is now, that Power Rangers used it's footage from a Japanese T.V. show. Since Power Rangers was so popular back then, I wish Fox Kids would have taken time to show us more where the show came from, possibly even showing subtitled episodes of Zyuranger back then on Fox. Imagine how American kids from back then would have reacted if they could have seen episodes of Zyuranger and compare it to Power Rangers?I've mostly talked about my thoughts on the Power Rangers. But, let me explain the movie. Well, years later when I watch episodes of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers I notice how this show wasn't entirely well done or well thought out. There seem to be plot holes and continuity errors. It was a little the same with this movie. I mean I noticed as a kid how this movie drifted from the series. We have the same characters play the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, but there are numerous things different from this movie than in the series. It doesn't feel like it's canon. This movie also took place in Australia. I'm not sure why they had to go all the way there. Interestingly, some of the episodes that were made around the time this movie was made were also filmed in Australia.Here's what I remember about this movie. I'm sure we all remember the opening scene which was skydiving. I wonder if that was actually the actors who were skydiving, though probably not because they'd have to be like professional skydivers to skydive as well as they did in the movie. It also would have been hard to film it, as cameramen shoot from different angles? They could have had professionals skydivers, or they could have just used a green screen to make it look like the characters were skydiving.I remember enjoying this movie. If you watched Power Rangers back then, you'd probably think the movie was enjoyable. I liked Ivan Ooze as a villain. However, I also remember around the same time I saw this movie when I saw the Power Rangers on stage. That show seemed more canon to the series than this movie and was a fun experience back then. You can see it on YouTube now, and it seems like a lot of people preferred that over the movie.They're working on a movie that is expected to come out sometime in 2017. I'm sure we've all noticed how a lot of TV shows that we remember when we were kids that even had previous movies made for them, are having new movies made based on the original versions with 21st Century action and special effects. They've done that with Transformers and they're working on a second Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie when a lot of us prefer the original 1990s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie.I'm waiting for the next movie. I feel like almost any film can be good if they have the right director who can come up with an entertaining movie. I bet the next Power Rangers movie will be better, or at least make a lot more money than the previous Power Rangers movies including this one which had a theatrical release.Well, that's it and I give this movie a 5\/10.

The Oscar for best cinematography was also well deserved. In certain scenes, the combination of character placement, camera angles and dialogue made for some really effective moments.

It was also a good choice to show the detective falling asleep in Laura's armchair, before waking up and seeing her come through the door. It makes you wonder if he actually woke up or if he's hallucinating, because she's dead, right?? As for the downsides, there are some issues with character consistency.

They should have gone with the first script by Shem Bitterman which had Jamie as the killer of the movie. I feel like this would have been the right direction to take the series. Instead they used the second unfinished script so they could make another generic slasher film.After Michael (Don Shanks) is shot into a mine shaft by the state police, he is swept down a river and ends up at hermits hut. Michael falls into a coma and this hermit (for some reason) nurses Michael back to health instead of calling the cops. One year later, Micheal kills the hermit and makes his way back to Haddonfield to try and kill his niece. Again.Jamie (Danielle Harris) is now a mute at a children's hospital after stabbing her step-mother last Halloween. However, this movie found a way to cheapen the ending of Halloween 4 by stating that she only did this because she and Michael are psychically connected. WTF? Anyway, now that Jamie is a mute and just sitting in a mental hospital, this means that the film has to focus on a new group of characters.Who is the new main character of this film? Rachael (Ellie Cornell) is sure to be the main character, right? No. Rachael is killed off in the first 20 minutes and we are left with her obnoxious friend Tina (Wendy Kaplan). There are few movie characters that can compete with Tina is terms of sheer annoyingness. The whole time I watched this movie I felt like Michael was sure taking his time is killing this hyperactive B**** in a maid costume.Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is also here but there isn't really any reason he is here. He does not do anything until the end film, and even then his role in minimal. Loomis does not even act like Loomis in this film. That is how out of character he is.Michael himself is a step-up from George P Wilbur's performance in the last film, but that is not saying much. The mask is this film is almost as bad as it was in Halloween 4, but I guess it is a little less cheap looking. Michael does stalk in the background like in the original film but it does not feel as scary as before. The walk is done more zombie-like this time around.The other characters in this film are just generic characters to rack up the body count. There are 2 cops that pay homage to the cops from Last House on Left with these clown sound effects. I don't know why Dominique Otherin-Girard though it would be a good idea to pay homage to one of the things that ruined a movie.The music score is the classic theme played with some different variations which sounds pretty good. Unfortunately the soundtrack is almost non-existent.Toward the end of the movie Loomis has the police set up a sting operation at the Myers house (using Jamie as bait) while waiting for Michael Myers. However a disturbance at the children's clinic causes all but 2 of the cops to leave. Michael shows up and kills the 2 cops and injures Loomis. Michael chases Jamie though the house which leads to Michael taking off his mask and crying like a F-ing baby. One of the worst parts in the series. Then Loomis catches Michael in a Scooby-Doo trap and beats Michael with a 2x4. Michael is then thrown into a jail cell. Then a man in black arrives at the police station and shoots it up and disappears with Michael.The man in black appears a couple times in the movie, so you know that he was going to do something at the end of the movie. It just makes the movie so predictable that way. Even putting that aside, Halloween 5 is a bland movie to begin with. It has so cool moments, like when Jamie is trying to climb up a laundry chute while Michael stabs the chute Jamie is in. Lots of suspense there.

Again.Jamie (Danielle Harris) is now a mute at a children's hospital after stabbing her step-mother last Halloween. However, this movie found a way to cheapen the ending of Halloween 4 by stating that she only did this because she and Michael are psychically connected. WTF? Anyway, now that Jamie is a mute and just sitting in a mental hospital, this means that the film has to focus on a new group of characters.Who is the new main character of this film? Rachael (Ellie Cornell) is sure to be the main character, right? No. Rachael is killed off in the first 20 minutes and we are left with her obnoxious friend Tina (Wendy Kaplan). There are few movie characters that can compete with Tina is terms of sheer annoyingness. The whole time I watched this movie I felt like Michael was sure taking his time is killing this hyperactive B**** in a maid costume.Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is also here but there isn't really any reason he is here. He does not do anything until the end film, and even then his role in minimal. Loomis does not even act like Loomis in this film. That is how out of character he is.Michael himself is a step-up from George P Wilbur's performance in the last film, but that is not saying much. The mask is this film is almost as bad as it was in Halloween 4, but I guess it is a little less cheap looking. Michael does stalk in the background like in the original film but it does not feel as scary as before. The walk is done more zombie-like this time around.The other characters in this film are just generic characters to rack up the body count. There are 2 cops that pay homage to the cops from Last House on Left with these clown sound effects. I don't know why Dominique Otherin-Girard though it would be a good idea to pay homage to one of the things that ruined a movie.The music score is the classic theme played with some different variations which sounds pretty good. Unfortunately the soundtrack is almost non-existent.Toward the end of the movie Loomis has the police set up a sting operation at the Myers house (using Jamie as bait) while waiting for Michael Myers. However a disturbance at the children's clinic causes all but 2 of the cops to leave. Michael shows up and kills the 2 cops and injures Loomis. Michael chases Jamie though the house which leads to Michael taking off his mask and crying like a F-ing baby. One of the worst parts in the series. Then Loomis catches Michael in a Scooby-Doo trap and beats Michael with a 2x4. Michael is then thrown into a jail cell. Then a man in black arrives at the police station and shoots it up and disappears with Michael.The man in black appears a couple times in the movie, so you know that he was going to do something at the end of the movie. It just makes the movie so predictable that way. Even putting that aside, Halloween 5 is a bland movie to begin with. It has so cool moments, like when Jamie is trying to climb up a laundry chute while Michael stabs the chute Jamie is in. Lots of suspense there. Donald Pleasance and Danielle Harris do great with what little they had, but it was not enough to save the film.A Step-Down From The Last Film 3\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"3 November 2015","score":"","review":" I would've gotten away with it if it wasn't for you meddling kids and your dog too! Scooby-Doo is still one of my favorite cartoons and when I first watch the live action movie on HBO it just had to seen to believe. Actually I was laughing through out the movie while it did have some moments that made me go what were they thinking? But still I actually entertain from this movie.The plot of the film is that the Mystery Gang Scobby-Doo, Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr), Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Shaggy (Matthew Lillard), and Velma (Linda Cardellini) are invited to a island theme park by Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson) however things are not what they appear to be. Also we are introduce to Mary Jane (Isla Fisher) N'Goo Tuana (Steven Grives) and Voodoo Maestro (Miguel A.Nunez Jr) As the plot goes on I like how they added the theme song because come on everyone has heard Scooby-Doo where are you? and know that theme by heart just having that theme more than once really does a good job. In fact a lot of the music in the film is enjoyable and the songs they feature in it have that special it factor.As for the acting, it is actually good Matthew's performance as Shaggy is just superb as he study the character very well He just shine as Shaggy, Sarah was very good as Daphne, Linda did well as Velma and Freddie did look the part of Freddie. But yeah the movie does feature some good acting just got to be more open mind about it. As for Scooby Doo I enjoy the C.G.I.

Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy requires re-reading the book, and rewinding in mid-film, to catch key plot developments. The Russia House is, in this vein, a classic Le Carre yarn, co- adapted to the screen by Le Carre and the talented Tom Stoppard. The film is produced and directed by Australian filmmaker Fred Schipisi, notable for the excellent and psychodynamic Six Degrees of Separation and the fulsomely enjoyable Roxanne. Schipisi's direction and production values are this film's weakest points, the framed shots from the start look amateurishly ungainly, ill-framed, and ill-cut. The director's only saving perhaps was the decision to allow jazz man Branford Marsalis to score the film, with mostly lilting haunts of soprano sax melodies. The story centers on a Brit, played by Sean Connery, and a Russian, played by Michele Pfeiffer. It is 1990, and glasnost has been declared. Connery's leading man, Barley Blair, is a Russophilic book editor fond of extended stays in grey Moscow. Pfeiffer's co-lead, Katya, is a Russian of almost anonymous identity beyond the familiar tropes. Katya has a friend who programs Russia's nukes, the friend wants Russia's secrets out, and Katya is recruited to vouchsafe them as written down to Barley, this westerner with a kind soul and an avowed commitment to humanism. Let's start with the biggest and best part of the film, Connery. His Barley is a glorious, ruined shambles. A gentle, aging hedonist, who looks, stealing a line from the film like an unmade bed with a shopping bag attached. Connery is entertaining and engaging in every frame, truly inhabiting Barley as an original character.Pfeiffer is very good, if not at her best as the Russian woman beholden by secrets and restrained by crippling caution. Her Russian-tinted accent is querulous in the first minutes of the film, but by the midpoint she achieves--and she may do it with her cheekbones as much as her diction, it all counts--believability as a Russian person. The other great strength The Russia House has, which has sustained the film as watchable and re-watchable over time, is the large supporting cast of male actors portraying the MI6 and CIA spooks who Barley haphazardly encounters, and very quickly takes direction from. James Fox, Roy Scheider, John Mahoney, Michael Kitchen and an almost SNL-flamboyant Ian McNeice (as the riotously out-of-place Merrydew) provide a fantastical espionage-ical Greek chorus that set off Connery's ethical and emotional contretemps.The film's final potent ingredient is a solo supporting performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as (code name) Dante, a mysterious Russian who seems to be behind the searching questions the men in grey directing Barley seem to have. The Russia House is neither the best wrought Le Carre story on film, nor the best Russia film depicting the second cold war era of the 1980s. It would take a quick undercard to The Hunt for Red October. It would lose in a close decision to Gorky Park. But Connery as Barley above all is worth the ticket, which leaves the film in the category of worthy, even with the producer\/director's foibles set against it.

In addition, if you're not able to take a cult classic action sports human drama movie of all time, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Rocky (1976) It is still today one of the best action, sport, drama and a cult classic low budget films ever made in history. It is an underdog story telling about a men and his struggle in his life. Sure, I know that without it, there'd be no sequels for a ranking, but compared to III, although this Best Picture of 1976 was great, it just dragged a bit for me. I'm no brainless action-goer, mind you. I love real human drama portrayed on screen. I've got to say though, at times, you feel like you're watching a documentary on a real man's life. It's that much realistic. This to me is a no brainier. You get introduced to an insecure Rocky who works for the mob as a collector, but has too big of a heart to go around hurting people in an awesome heartfelt movie. Adrian and Rock meet, You get introduced to the lovable A-hole Pauly. Introduced to Creed. Introduced to Mick. and BUTKUS! And Rock goes the distance with Creed! This movie has a Heart . As a kid Rocky III was my favorite best movie ,but this one is my second best movie. YO ADRIAN I DID IT!!! It is my first best favorite film in the series and I just love this film to death. It has a message and it is portraying a real human drama. Rocky is a movie that everyone can relate to. One of my favorite Stallone roles, there is nobody else who could play Rocky better than him, it's too bad that he didn't win Oscar because i honestly think that he deserved it. But at least movie won the best picture of the year award. Maybe Rocky didn't win the fight in the movie, but Stallone did win his fight in real life. Rocky, a poor guy that just barley manages to get by, just wants to fight. However, everyone including his trainer has given up on him. Rocky also wants to go on a date with Adrian, a very shy girl who works at the local pet store, Adrian, however, is too shy to even say anything to anyone. Meanwhile, Apollo Creed (the heavy-weight champion of boxing) learns that his boxing partner has been injured and can't fight. Apollo tries all the other potential boxing partners, but every one of them refuse. Apollo decides to give an unknown boxer a chance to fight him for the title, with the intentions of just giving him five minutes of fame then knocking him out. Apollo picks Rocky. This is the Rocky's only shot at the big time and chance he will never get it back.Rocky Balboa is a struggling boxer trying to make the big time, working as a debt collector for a pittance. When heavyweight champion Apollo Creed visits Philadelphia, his managers want to set up an exhibition match between Creed and a struggling boxer, touting the fight as a chance for a nobody to become a somebody. The match is supposed to be easily won by Creed, but someone forgot to tell Rocky, who sees this as his only shot at the big time. Sylvester Stallone, himself a virtual unknown, managed to sell his Rocky script (one of 35 that he'd written over the years) on the proviso that he be given the starring role. Since the film was to be made on a shoestring and marketed on a low-level basis, the risk factor to United Artists was small. For Stallone, this was a make-or-break opportunity &#x97; just like Rocky's million-to-one shot with Apollo Creed. Costing under a million dollars, Rocky managed to register with audiences everywhere, earning back 60 times its cost. The film won several Academy Awards, including Best Picture.The original Rocky film is one of the greatest epic action sport drama film in the history! It contains action, humor, romance, and an uplifting message. The screenplay is great, and features some truly touching moments. There is also some great camera work, thanks to the new Steadicam. It's a shame Stallone's later career and all the Rocky sequels have lessened this film in the eyes of many. This film is truly a classic and deserves to be seen at least once by everyone.Rocky is a 1976 American sports drama film directed by John G. Avildsen and both written by and starring Sylvester Stallone.10\/10 Grade Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio Chartoff-Winkler Productions, United Artists Starring Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Burgess Meredith Director John G.

In addition, if you're not able to take a cult classic action sports human drama movie of all time, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Rocky (1976) It is still today one of the best action, sport, drama and a cult classic low budget films ever made in history. It is an underdog story telling about a men and his struggle in his life. Sure, I know that without it, there'd be no sequels for a ranking, but compared to III, although this Best Picture of 1976 was great, it just dragged a bit for me. I'm no brainless action-goer, mind you. I love real human drama portrayed on screen. I've got to say though, at times, you feel like you're watching a documentary on a real man's life. It's that much realistic. This to me is a no brainier. You get introduced to an insecure Rocky who works for the mob as a collector, but has too big of a heart to go around hurting people in an awesome heartfelt movie. Adrian and Rock meet, You get introduced to the lovable A-hole Pauly. Introduced to Creed. Introduced to Mick. and BUTKUS! And Rock goes the distance with Creed! This movie has a Heart . As a kid Rocky III was my favorite best movie ,but this one is my second best movie. YO ADRIAN I DID IT!!! It is my first best favorite film in the series and I just love this film to death. It has a message and it is portraying a real human drama. Rocky is a movie that everyone can relate to. One of my favorite Stallone roles, there is nobody else who could play Rocky better than him, it's too bad that he didn't win Oscar because i honestly think that he deserved it. But at least movie won the best picture of the year award. Maybe Rocky didn't win the fight in the movie, but Stallone did win his fight in real life. Rocky, a poor guy that just barley manages to get by, just wants to fight. However, everyone including his trainer has given up on him. Rocky also wants to go on a date with Adrian, a very shy girl who works at the local pet store, Adrian, however, is too shy to even say anything to anyone. Meanwhile, Apollo Creed (the heavy-weight champion of boxing) learns that his boxing partner has been injured and can't fight. Apollo tries all the other potential boxing partners, but every one of them refuse. Apollo decides to give an unknown boxer a chance to fight him for the title, with the intentions of just giving him five minutes of fame then knocking him out. Apollo picks Rocky. This is the Rocky's only shot at the big time and chance he will never get it back.Rocky Balboa is a struggling boxer trying to make the big time, working as a debt collector for a pittance. When heavyweight champion Apollo Creed visits Philadelphia, his managers want to set up an exhibition match between Creed and a struggling boxer, touting the fight as a chance for a nobody to become a somebody. The match is supposed to be easily won by Creed, but someone forgot to tell Rocky, who sees this as his only shot at the big time. Sylvester Stallone, himself a virtual unknown, managed to sell his Rocky script (one of 35 that he'd written over the years) on the proviso that he be given the starring role. Since the film was to be made on a shoestring and marketed on a low-level basis, the risk factor to United Artists was small. For Stallone, this was a make-or-break opportunity &#x97; just like Rocky's million-to-one shot with Apollo Creed. Costing under a million dollars, Rocky managed to register with audiences everywhere, earning back 60 times its cost. The film won several Academy Awards, including Best Picture.The original Rocky film is one of the greatest epic action sport drama film in the history! It contains action, humor, romance, and an uplifting message. The screenplay is great, and features some truly touching moments. There is also some great camera work, thanks to the new Steadicam.
