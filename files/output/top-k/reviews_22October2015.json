Metropolis is one of the most historically important films ever made, because it was an artistic German Expressionist masterpiece, that boldly challenged the Nazi Party, and still has a massive impact on cinema today. It was an angry film pointed at its geographical time and place, but it also offered some major positives for the industry. Lang used several techniques that have become recognized as key elements of German Expressionism, most noticeably lighting. A good example of this was the scene that introduces Maria for the first time, multiple times contrasting lighting techniques were used to highlight particular characters. This technique gave Maria an angelic look, when she spoke, as well as highlighting the reactions of particular characters. Another element of German expressionism was. These lighting techniques were also used often with the presence of the character Rotwang, with this character various lighting techniques were used to make his rooms darker, and give Rotwang large shadows. Just by lighting techniques Lang told the audience how to feel about certain characters, something many filmmakers have since copied. These lighting techniques are great examples of German Expressionism, but they also help shape the narrative, and tone of the film. The narrative of Metropolis leans in the direction of formalist, because it very heavily promotes a thematic point, has a scrambled sense of time, and is occasionally intruded with the director's style. The film's narrative has very clear religious parallels and a clear message, against the Nazi Party, and their regime. At a time when the amount of propaganda films were rising, Metropolis was able to send a message with clever subtlety. The evidence that Lang was angry with the, at the time, new Nazi Party is evident through the religious parallels, especially with Israel. It's no secret how the Nazi's felt about members of the Hebrew religion, and the parallels often connected to the Hebrew religion. The catacomb scene in the film contains the best examples of this as the candles behind Maria resemble a menorah, the iconic candle that the Hebrew religion celebrates Hanukkah with. Maria has a very close association with the woman in Revelation 12, it seems relevant to point out that in the catacomb scene the candles behind Maria, may represent the crown of twelve stars. The religious parallels combined with the well known fact that Fritz Lang didn't like the Nazi Party, most likely because of his Jewish heritage, help reinforce that Metropolis was film with an angry anti-Nazi message. Perhaps the most impressive thing about Metropolis is the powerfully real way that Lang showed us his apocalyptic vision. The world is scary, because it's realistic, and powerful, because it resembled an interpretation of the world the Nazi's preached about creating. The evidence that the world resembled a Nazi vision are, again, in the religious parallels, this time with the story of Exodus. The film is clear that the world has three divisions, the hand (the Egyptian slaves\/the poor), the brain (the pharoah\/Joh Frederson), and the heart (Freder\/Moses), it is noteworthy that the story of Exodus is about Hebrew liberation. The film was powerful, because of it's message, but is also one of the most influential of the classical Science Fiction films, and still has a massive impact on films today. Visually the Metropolis was made to be a beautiful paradox that is magnificent, yet equally hellish, this look has been copied numerous times throughout the years. Examples of this are in Blade Runner, Dark City, Escape From New York, and the Matrix. The dark yet beautiful apocalyptic world would become a staple of futuristic Science Fiction films. Another visual staple of Metropolis was the look of the citizens, specifically the poor, who are a bland, uniform set of people, beaten to submission. This has been used in films like THX 1138, and more recently films like Snowpiercer, and the Hunger Games. Another impactful aspect of the film is Rotwang's metal hand, which has been copied famously in Dr. Strangelove, and Star Wars. There are many more things that Metropolis has inspired over the years, these are many more things that Metropolis has inspired over the years, these examples were just a few examples of the impact of Metropolis.

The film was a spoof of the entire American special forces, and their protocols. Dr. Strangelove was a witty satire of the paranoia towards communism, the overly complex emergency protocols, and the U.S. special forces leadership. It was also most likely a film that would predict the future culture of America. In the mid 1960's, when Dr. Strangelove came out, respect for the government was paramount to the masses, this trust would be violated just a few years later with the war of Vietnam. Looking at that maybe it's best to say Dr. Strangelove was slightly ahead of it's time, and maybe it even helped shape the future cultures opinions. Either way the irreverence that Dr. Strangelove showed towards the U.S. politicians and special forces was at the time, controversial, mostly because the most accepted idea was that these people and institutions were off limits. The film was brimming with irony, most likely symbolizing that Kubrick felt the cold war, and paranoia had an ironic air to it. The film seems to reinforce that Kubrick thought the whole situation was ridiculous, and the irony of the hysteria wasn't lost on Kubrick either. There are examples of this littered throughout the film, and Kubrick obviously found something funny about it all, it's easy to look back and laugh, but at the time this film was bold, because it was as scary as it was funny to those watching it. As was mentioned earlier the film's cornerstone is the ironic humor, for example the ironic scoring. Kubrick was a master of using music to further his movie, especially in 2001 A Space Odyssey, but in this instance the music was an extension of Kubrick's opinions. Used brilliantly the music had a peaceful scariness, as soft melodic music plays over bomb carriers flying through the sky. Another element Kubrick wouldn't shy away from, especially with irony, was the overly masculine posturing of both countries. Irony was also used to satirize the U.S. leadership, often showing the irony of the special forces. Good examples of this are the poster reading Peace is our Profession, or Slim Picken's talking about promotions as they unknowingly go rogue, or the most famous quote of the film Gentlemen you can't fight here, this is the war room. All of these are great examples of the overly militarized society that we were living in, something Kubrick must have hated. Coming at a time of change for the country, and possibly helping that change happen Kubrick boldly satirized one of the most respected organizations in the United States with reckless abandon. However, maybe in doing so gave the country exactly what it needed, a vehicle to laugh and poke fun at how ridiculous the countries were acting.

He knows you probably won't care for him as much as the one that came before him. But he would like to try. Maybe if you just spent some time with him, you'd grow to appreciate that he is not in any way or form trying to replace his predecessor but that he's always there for you if you need him.With that in mind, the low-budget sequel to the surprise slasher\/thriller flick, The Stepfather is a noticeable yet serviceable step-down from the original. Director Jeff Burr, who would go on to helm other horror sequels like Leatherface The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III and Pumpkinhead II Blood Wings does a pretty decent job of keeping Stepfather II from being too much of a step-down in quality. While the suspense from the original is all but gone, the film moves at a nice pace that compliments its somewhat contrived feeling. You might not be surprised or shocked while watching the film, but you'll never find yourself counting the minutes until it's over, either.It helps that the film boasts a solid cast. Leading the pack is the indispensable Terry O'Quinn, returning to the titular role. O'Quinn is given many an opportunity to expand on the character and have a little fun with it, and boy, does he. One line in particular -- the disgusted I even had sex with you, for God's sake! -- hinges completely on his deadpan delivery and his commitment to the character. Meg Foster plays his would-be wife, and as with anything she's appeared in, she's a pleasure to watch and classes up the whole affair in the process. A young Jonathan Brandis plays the hapless and clueless kid to perfection, while Caroline Williams entertains as the suspicious and somewhat obnoxious best-friend and neighbor, making the perfect foil for O'Quinn.The film was born in the era of mindless yet enjoyable slasher sequels and it shows. There is a lot of extra violence and gore that was shoe-horned in at the last minute, much to the dismay of the director, and often the film plays for cheap thrills whenever possible. But while it is nowhere near as effective as its predecessor, it is an enjoyable and breezy 89 minutes just the same. Worth seeing just to see Terry O'Quinn do his thing once more (he would be replaced in the mostly unseen third installment) and certainly of interest to any fan of '80s horror just the same.

The shots almost always showed a full setting, along with what was happening, as if preparing to guide us viewers in the direction to what would happen next. Leni Riefenstahl used great footage to show all the excitement that was exclaimed by the people before Hitler's arrival to each event. The use of it really portrays Hitler as a person who is extremely well respected and praised, giving us an impression that he was the one who deserved it. Because of this documentary being filmed in the 1930's, it fascinates me that something so old can still be so interesting. I found it exciting to be able to hear a speech that was about to be made, because of all the build up of cheer that Riefenstahl showed. One last thing I would like to add, even though this is in the German language, it is very easy to keep up with the subtitles and still get to see the footage without missing much.

This probably is one of the most overlooked gems in period movies. This movie is visually enchanting replete with lavish costumes and is therefore not surprising to know that this movie had won 2 Oscars &#x96; Art direction & Costume Design.Restoration focuses on the gloomy aspects of the era life poverty, illness, medicine and the way of living during those times. This is a movie where you need to listen and absorb. You would enjoy it better watching it alone or with like-minded people. The story revolves around Robert Merivel, (Robert Downey Jr) who is a doctor during the reign of King Charles II (Sam Neil). He longs for the good life at the King's court and achieves it after successfully treating & saving His Majesty's royal dog. On gaining the King's favour Merival gives in completely to the rich life and all that it brings with it. This until he make a deal with the King and is married off to His mistress on the condition that Merivel is not to fall in fall with her. However he does do the one thing that is forbidden of him and ends up losing the King's favour. We are taken on a journey to two worlds; one of luxury another modest. We see how Downey lives in both of them. He returns to work with his Quaker friend John Pearce, (David Thewlis) at a mental institution where he meets and impregnates an Irish cuckold (Meg Ryan). However, when she gives in childbirth, he takes it upon himself to help cure London of the plague. He gets caught in the Great Fire of 1666 where he is left to believe that all is lost. Fate, however, has other plans. Downey has pulled off the English accent very proficiently. He looks foppish in curls and his short trousers & pulled off the transformation in Merival's outlook with élan. It most certainly was a moving performance and strikes a chord within you. This was the time when Downey was in war with his own personal demons in substance abuse. He does not look healthy but, the role fits his worn-down appearance and brings to life Merivel. I can't imagine any other actor playing Merivel. The rest of the cast slid into their roles perfectly.

Our first introduction to Dracula, rather than the mysterious and menacing one we often see, is instead his back story, followed by a genuinely comical encounter with Harker in his castle. There's no buildup, it just drops us in amidst the bombastic music and crazy special effects that go far beyond mere foreshadowing. It's almost cartoonish. Give us some foreshadowing, build the tension until the moment Harker discovers the truth about Dracula. I understand Coppola may not have wanted to retread the same plot points that other adaptations have, but come on. I also wasn't a fan of some of the over-the-top visual elements, such as Dracula's shadow doing weird things all the time.Gary Oldman does a good job with the interpretation of Dracula he was given, but never once is he anything close to scary; he's just silly. Hopkins's Van Helsing is equally ridiculous. I won't say anything about Reeves's performance. We...we all know.The sound design is far too overbearing. What's with the random whispery sounds going on all the time? Is that supposed to be diegetic? If so then why isn't Harker freaked out by it? And if not, why is Coppola trying so hard to scare the viewers with silly things that aren't even part of what's happening in the film?And then there's Mina. What a horrible, irredeemable character. The entire romance subplot was just awful, and it was far more disturbing than any evil act Dracula himself might do because it's just so wrong, and yet by the end we're supposed to feel something for Dracula and Mina and their relationship with its Love Conquers All conclusion? I don't think so. It's not a matter of hypnosis either; the film makes that pretty clear. Mina genuinely falls in love with this monster who eats babies and murdered her best friend and left her fiancé to die an agonizing death. Almost everything in this movie points to it being some kind of parody.That said, it has some cool moments. There's a lot that is pretty faithful to the book - moments I haven't seen addressed in other adaptations - and it looks pretty great for the most part.

Well, if this film reflects anything of the young Reagan's virtuosity, it seems we didn't miss much. Cast as Errol Flynn's best friend and love-rival, he comes over as the lesser half of the duo, and his limitations show up plainly - a handsome tailor's dummy who can speak clearly, but never with force or conviction.Here he is wearing the uniform of a US Army cadet, one of a troublesome gang who are punished by being sent on their first posting to Kansas, the edge of civilisation in 1855, and the scene of guerrilla fighting between abolitionists and pro-slavery patrols, often viewed as the curtain-raiser for the civil war.The opening is almost comic - a line of cadets being called out by name, all the names belonging to famous future generals who could not possibly have been at West Point in the same year. We could spend all night listing the other inaccuracies, but some details, at least, are historical. Robert E. Lee was indeed head of the military academy, who later arrested John Brown, with cavalry leader Jeb Stuart holding a white flag of truce, while trying to parley with the rebels. And it is also true that the religious maniac Brown was betrayed by his own Judas, for greed of gold.The title 'Santa Fe Trail' does not really signify anything much, except that the planners of the big new railroad are having to suspend work until John Brown's body is firmly in the grave, and the boss's beautiful daughter (Olivia De Havilland), is being competed-for by Stuart (Flynn) and Custer (Reagan) in a style almost reminiscent of Bing and Bob.Star of the show is Raymond Massey as Brown, hugely sinister both in physical presence and in ominous wild talk. Remembering that America must have known by 1940 that it was in for a long war, the political message had to be an appeal for national unity, so most of the characters come out against secession. This has divided modern critics, who are inclined to focus solely on that issue, some dismissing it as a pro-slavery film, others questioning Brown's belief that slavery could be ended only by bloodshed. Neutral observers now agree that slavery would have withered away by about 1880, and even Brown's supporters might accept that We recognise no law but the law of God is a bit of a cop-out.A disappointingly weak script by the prolific Robert Buckner. It is not too believable that an elderly Native American clairvoyant would tell the cadets that all of them would become generals, but that they would soon be fighting each other. And the De Havilland character looks odd walking up to an officer and saying Shall we dance? I thought they were just meant to wait and yearn.

Well, if this film reflects anything of the young Reagan's virtuosity, it seems we didn't miss much. Cast as Errol Flynn's best friend and love-rival, he comes over as the lesser half of the duo, and his limitations show up plainly - a handsome tailor's dummy who can speak clearly, but never with force or conviction.Here he is wearing the uniform of a US Army cadet, one of a troublesome gang who are punished by being sent on their first posting to Kansas, the edge of civilisation in 1855, and the scene of guerrilla fighting between abolitionists and pro-slavery patrols, often viewed as the curtain-raiser for the civil war.The opening is almost comic - a line of cadets being called out by name, all the names belonging to famous future generals who could not possibly have been at West Point in the same year. We could spend all night listing the other inaccuracies, but some details, at least, are historical. Robert E. Lee was indeed head of the military academy, who later arrested John Brown, with cavalry leader Jeb Stuart holding a white flag of truce, while trying to parley with the rebels. And it is also true that the religious maniac Brown was betrayed by his own Judas, for greed of gold.The title 'Santa Fe Trail' does not really signify anything much, except that the planners of the big new railroad are having to suspend work until John Brown's body is firmly in the grave, and the boss's beautiful daughter (Olivia De Havilland), is being competed-for by Stuart (Flynn) and Custer (Reagan) in a style almost reminiscent of Bing and Bob.Star of the show is Raymond Massey as Brown, hugely sinister both in physical presence and in ominous wild talk. Remembering that America must have known by 1940 that it was in for a long war, the political message had to be an appeal for national unity, so most of the characters come out against secession. This has divided modern critics, who are inclined to focus solely on that issue, some dismissing it as a pro-slavery film, others questioning Brown's belief that slavery could be ended only by bloodshed. Neutral observers now agree that slavery would have withered away by about 1880, and even Brown's supporters might accept that We recognise no law but the law of God is a bit of a cop-out.A disappointingly weak script by the prolific Robert Buckner. It is not too believable that an elderly Native American clairvoyant would tell the cadets that all of them would become generals, but that they would soon be fighting each other. And the De Havilland character looks odd walking up to an officer and saying Shall we dance? I thought they were just meant to wait and yearn.

Lawrence. In many ways Lawrence of Arabia exemplifies an Epic, but what may be most impressive about the film is it's use of character development and themes. Lawrence of Arabia may be the best epic of all time, because it is grand in scope, long but never boring, and beautiful to look at. It truly is a masterpiece.When one thinks of what defines an epic, they could point to Lawrence of Arabia as a perfect example, it literally sets the standard. For example Lawrence of Arabia contains many Extreme Wide Shots of a vast panoramic landscape, this is one of the most recognizable elements of a epic, reinforcing how large in scope the story is. Most epics deal with stories that have a sense of spectacle, and therefore use these huge landscapes to show that, Lawrence of Arabia does that as well as any other film.Set against the Arabic dessert, which lends itself to large panoramic landscape shots, the audience is treated to seeing a beautiful picture, and in the middle we see these characters trying to navigate their way through it all. The film liked to use mostly wide shots, so much so that when they use a close up, it truly feels like it has meaning. On top of that Lawrence of Arabia contains some of the most luxurious set designs, and costumes of the time. High production values is of course is another common element of an epic, but the most impressive thing about Lawrence of Arabia is the pacing and the character development.At almost four hours it's hard to imagine a film that wouldn't feel long, but somehow Lawrence of Arabia manages not to. This is most likely because the themes and characters are both relatable, but also larger than life in some ways. Seeing a normal man navigate his way through massive desserts, and through foreign cultures may make him seem larger than life, but to his core the film keeps Lawrence human, so the audience never feels detached from him.The film deals with age old themes such as the fish out of water theme, which is used quite often, but arguably never better than in this film. As with most of the best films, the story and character development is mostly visual. In the beginning we quickly see how out of place Lawrence is, as we see his Arab escort shot for stealing water, Lawrence is outraged, as to him killing is taboo, and water is a common commodity, yet to the Arab culture, Water is so precious it's worth killing for. As the film goes on Lawrence learns the cultural difference, and learns not to treat other cultures as barbaric, because to them he is the barbarian.Utilizing beautiful grandeur Lawrence of Arabia still stands as one of, the best epics of all time, and a true masterpiece of cinema.

A man known as El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) seeks retribution after the love of his life was killed by Moco (a drug lord who played a major role in the first movie). Enlisting the help of his American friend (played by Buscemi), he learns that the man responsible for his wife's death is a drug lord named Bucho (Joaquim de Almeida). On his journey to locate and kill Bucho, he meets Carolina (Selma Hayek) with whom he falls in love. The plot is pretty generic and it's the action sequences, witty dialogue, and storytelling, along with the production value which makes Desperado so great.The movie begins with the American entering a bar in Mexico in a manner which immediately gravitates attention onto him. He sits down and asks for a beer. The cleverness and wittiness of the movie becomes apparent as soon as Buscemi opens his mouth. He explains that he had previously visited another bar where he had a terrible experience. He exclaims that the people there were lowlifes who, unlike the ones currently surrounding him, had no class. He makes sure to clarify that he speaks of the other bar, and not this one. Now one might think that he makes the clarification in order to appease hostility that he might receive due to misunderstanding, but I say he does more. I say he's vague on purpose. In addition to complementing the bar, he also praises the beer, claiming it as the best he'd ever had. But we find out later that everyone finds the beer disgusting, likening it to the taste of urine. So why would Buscemi speak so highly of such a bad tasting beer? It's because of juxtaposition. He aligns his praise of the beer with his praise of the bar and the high class people inside. It's safe to assume that he's lying about liking the beer, but the fact that he's associating the piss tasting beverage with the rest of the bar indicates that his compliments are not only not genuine but insults. This is further supported by his admission that the other bar's beer is similar, but not as good. This means that the other bar was bad, contained lowlifes, and equally as vile beer. Reinforcing this claim is the manner in which he describes the lowlifes of the other bar. He proceeds by saying, vaguely, and this bar, pausing and turning his head around and continuing with a raised voice is full of real lowlifes. His tone indicates that he wanted them to hear the lowlifes bit. And like his other vague comments about a bar being terrible, he follows up with a clarification that he's speaking of the other bar. After planting the seed of mockery in their heads, it doesn't matter much that he clarifies himself other than to avoid violence. Both bars are equally bad, and he cleverly got away with insulting them.The rest of the movie is a series of action-packed bar battles, street battles, and even one at a bookstore. All have one thing in common, a guitar case containing all sorts of guns and grenades that made El Mariachi a living legend. The best, in my opinion, is the bookstore scene. It was the most violent scene, but not in the conventional way. Bucho had figured out that El Mariachi was hiding out at a bookstore which he uses for drug trades by bribing the owner, Carolina. Bucho's Men sneak to the top bedroom floor where they presume El Mariachi and Carolina were sleeping. Carolina is sitting on the bed, back faced to the wall door, eyes closed and playing the guitar while singing. She's clearly unaware of the men sneaking outside. Nor is she aware that El Mariachi is awake and senses the men. As the men approach from the left side (behind a curtained window), he grabs a gun and lifts it past Carolina's closed eyes and aims. Then he senses other men coming from the right side, prompting him to lift another gun past Carolina's head. As the men move closer to the door behind Carolina, El Mariachi continues to point at them, moving his arms in accordance with their movement. But as they arrived at the door, he found himself pointing both guns at Carolina, who's still unaware of what's going on. Finally the tension breaks, Mariachi pushes Carolina out of the way, and violence ensues. It's a brilliant scene putting together two contrasting things, emphasizing the beauty and peacefulness of Carolina's singing, in light of the very thing that will destroy it, not to eliminate it, but to save it.A beautiful film.

It's a brilliant scene putting together two contrasting things, emphasizing the beauty and peacefulness of Carolina's singing, in light of the very thing that will destroy it, not to eliminate it, but to save it.A beautiful film.

I think it's a sequel that's more than a classic in its own right and in scale at least, it outdoes the first film. It's also the sequel that is closest in tone and spirit to the original, which is something that seems to be unfairly disregarded about it. It has a very high amount of gore, with all the violence being shown directly rather than implied, which I reckon helps things immensely. It's very visually disturbing and graphic, with several great mad scenes and moments in it. The horrendous pit-like maintenence level of the asylum is a hell of man's own making, I find the rising pulse sound when Kirsty sees the apparition of what she believes is her dead father to be hair-raising, the scene of Julia's resurrection plays out like a little event that you don't really want to witness and is particularly full-on, the screams of the poor hallucinating mental patient bore right into you, and it's gotta be one of the most gruesome scenes in all horror cinema! There really is nothing more horrifying than watching human flesh be mutilated and damaged... I absolutely love the labyrinthine vision of hell, with its 'god' hovering over it in the form of an immense version of the puzzle, it's wondrously Gothic and foreboding. I like the idea of hell being a place that forces you to relive your darkest secrets and traumas, and scenes like the nightmare circus and when Kirsty sees the picture of her mother as well as the dark dimension beginning to spill over into the real world are strange and unsettling and it conveys the ominous feeling that good and evil, all of the characters are approaching the bottom of a descent into madness... Awesome chilling ending too, with the infernal pillar of souls and the face of the beast revealed. The locusts are a nice touch. Everyone in this does really well, Ashley Lawrence was great again as her beautiful feisty self, she and Imogen Boorman had good gal chemistry together and made for two great heroines. Boorman was fine, she was vital to the plot and all of that and had a lovely angelic quality of innocence to her that worked a lot more in her favour when she kept her gob shut.. The woman that played skinless Julia managed to give an eerily elegant and even alluring performance through her grotesquely amazing makeup effects. I never clicked on that it wasn't actually Claire Higgins, who was terrifically villainous in her role. Such a bitch, she was so good at making you despise her! Her trick of sucking the life out of unsuspecting victims with her fingernails was so vile. Great payoff for the character when she gets even with Frank by ripping out his still beating heart and holding it up to the fire! And what a legend of a character Hellraiser himself is, his every word is so commanding and magnetic, I'm totally compelled not to talk over any of his scenes! And even though they only contact with each other twice, I think it's enough that you get the feel of something between him and Kirsty, like a begrudging admiration of her spirit from him, as well as perhaps a desire for his soul to be set free? I love how the music swells so dramatically as he enters! Kenneth Cranham is excellent and quietly drives the events of the movie forward. When he's still just a man his coldblooded slaughter of human lives in his diabolical pursuit to know what lies beyond is horrific enough, but when he's transformed into an utterly insane cenobite who revels in his own viciousness and is constantly held aloft by a phallic thing and wields bizarre stigmata snakes that bloom into shifting instruments of murder, I just find the character to be terror incarnate and hideously creepy, I think he's one of the most genuinely nightmarish horror movie creations ever. I love all of his fun tacky medical-related punchlines! I think giving the guy a twisted sense of humour made him more scary. And he could only slaughter the cenobites like that because they were weak and expendable because of their newly awakened humanity. Disturbing, unsettling, scary and at times disgusting, this great horror film is always my pleasure, and I think this patient is finished!
