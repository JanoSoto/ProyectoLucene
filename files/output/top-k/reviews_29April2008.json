Faith has been divided into two Christianity and Protestant. The zealous Queen Mary of Scots rules England, but has no heir to take over her reign, since she bares no son. The only one next in line for the throne is her sister, Elizabeth, a protestant. When she fails the attempt to execute her for treason, Mary closely falls to her deathbed, and Elizabeth, closer to sit in her throne and rule over England. All these and later events are portrayed perfectly in ELIZABETH, a bold, daring and visually stunning excursion into a dark realm of history and the life of the known Virgin Queen.Firstly, the stunning look of ELIZABETH is clearly worth mentioning. The sets and especially the costumes by Alexander Byrne are spectacular. Credit also goes to director Shekhar Kapur. A brilliant visionary, Kapur fills the screen with inspired beauty, easily seen in the film's design and stunning elaborate use of color. The shots of the palace and dungeons are dark and gloomy, as are the scenes showing great battle and fear. While the depressing scenes show real grief, scenes of joy, and most especially are scenes with Elizabeth (played by Cate Blanchett) are always associated with bright light. Director Kapur thinks the character specifically needs the brightness to associate with her radiance. He was most precise and correct.But the film isn't all style, it's also good with the actors and the script. The best performance, and perhaps the best thing about the film, is the stunning performance by Cate Blanchett as the Virgin Queen herself. Perhaps, when accepting the role of the Queen, Ms. Blanchett didn't just read the script, she must have also gotten herself in the character, saying I can do this!, and she does, most deserving of her Oscar nomination. In fact, I'll go as far as to say she would have won it. Supporting performances by Geoffrey Rush (as Sir Francis Walsingham), Richard Attenborough (as Sir William Cecil), Joseph Fiennes (as Sir Robert Dudley) and Christopher Eccleston (as the Duke of Norfolk) are all superb.Joined with the superb cinematography, brilliant score and excellent screen play written by Michael Hirst, giving breath of beauty and courage especially to the title character, all add up to the overall magnificence of this dark and stunning thriller.

Few would call Crimes and Misdemeanors Woody Allen's best film as writer\/director, but the more I watch it, the more I realize that it's not only my favorite, but in many ways the film Allen was working towards for the entirety of his career as a writer prior to this.In Crimes and Misdemeanors Allen revisits a recurring theme in many of his films, adultery. It would be a simplistic and narrow-minded view of this film to say that it was simply about adultery because it is really far more complex than that, and essentially a film about all varieties of human nature and relationships, and one could even argue- the relationship between reality and film as explored through the lens of genre- romantic comedy, Film-Noir, and documentary, and what parts of this film are- satire.Crimes and Misdemeanors is one of Allen's best scripts. Any screenplay attempting to accomplish as much as this one does could easily fall apart, and Allen has had less convincing attempts than this one with similar ambitions, but everything works beautifully here. This film practically defines the 'tragicomedy' sub-genre, with neither overpowering the other and much of the humor is dark humor originating in tragedy, something that is acknowledged by Allen through the character of Lester (played to perfection by Alan Alda), who comments that comedy is nothing more than tragedy plus time. He also mentions that comedy has to have an ending, and that's one of the best things about this movie- Allen allows dramatic scenes to succeed at being dramatic and emotional, then throws a hilarious punchline at you, which has an effect that is both entertaining and somewhat unsettling. This is an expertly-written movie.Crimes and Misdemeanors is the culmination of a decade of consistently brilliant, evocative, original, and fascinating films from Woody Allen, whose 80's output I would personally consider to be his best. His 70's work is far more popular, but his 80's work contains some of the most unique and memorable films ever made Stardust Memories, Zelig, The Purple Rose of Cairo, and Hannah and Her Sisters, as well as numerous overlooked and generally forgotten films that can only be called excellent, such as A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy, Broadway Danny Rose, Radio Days, September, and Another Woman.

Bullock plays Sidda, a successful writer and the daughter of the outrageous Vivi. Both mother and daughter are in crisis after Sidda's profile appears in Time Magazine, and the profile's author has emphasized Sidda's problems with her mother. Mother and daughter start sending hate notes, photos with their faces cut out, invitations with no address or date, etc. to one another as well as hanging up the phone upon hearing the other's voice. The other three ya-yas visit Sidda, slip her a date-rape drug and bring her to Louisiana, where they all live, so they can show her their Ya-ya secrets book and she can learn some things about her mother that she never knew.The somewhat contrived plot is saved by the wonderful acting of the entire cast. Burstyn has long been one of my favorite actresses, and she creates a powerful portrait of the alcoholic temperamental diva Vivi. She's backed up beautifully by another of my favorite actresses, Maggie Smith as well as Flanagan and Knight. Ashley Judd plays the young Vivi. She does an excellent job showing Vivi's progression from a fun-loving young woman rejected by her mother (Cherry Jones) but adored by her father to an unhappy, drunken and overwhelmed one with a husband she doesn't love and too many children. Bullock's angry Sidda is effective, and her scenes with Burstyn are very poignant. James Garner as Bullock's long- suffering but loving father gives a wonderful performance, showing a caring but resigned man who has somehow managed to live with this woman for years.This isn't Fried Green Tomatoes. It's a portrait of an abusive childhood, mental illness, misinformation about medications - and survival. Unfortunately some of the people reviewing this film don't have a clear understanding of mental illness and what the wrong medication can do to someone. The story is tempered with humor and vibrant characterizations and the old adage, we don't pick our parents; if we can make our peace with their lives and with them, it makes life a little easier.

As an earlier reviewer on this site has mentioned, this movie is not as good as the original Aladdin, but much better than the second one in both story and animation.Having Robin Williams come back to reprise his role as the Genie was probably what made this movie above average. As talented a voice over artist as Dan Castellaneta is, he just couldn't fill Williams' shoes (or his lamp). So it was a pleasant surprise to have Williams back as his manic self with all his authentic, gut-busting gags and various celebrity impressions.However, that being said, having the Genie present a lot of the time created some fairly noticeable improbabilities and definite plot holes. For instance, when the 40 thieves raided Aladdin and Jasmine's wedding in the beginning, the Genie could have stopped all of them and sent them all to jail. I had the impression that the Genie's powers were infinite, so he was definitely capable of doing that. On the other hand, it wouldn't make for an interesting movie if the Genie magically solved everyone's problems. It still didn't seem right that the Genie just stalled during those climactic scenes, though.But with every problem the Genie didn't magically solve, there came a plot that was slightly more complicated than expected, and that's a good thing. The complicated plot made the story far more intriguing, and it added a great deal more depth to Aladdin's character. Caseem, Aladdin's estranged father, was also a great addition to the cast, and his character was equally appealing.Although we didn't see too much of Jasmine in this movie, she appeared to be a much stronger character than even in the original Aladdin movie. I commend the Disney company for making her a strong, supportive companion to Aladdin without making her appear to be a damsel in distress. In fact, the part where she punches one of the thieves for ruining my wedding was an excellent touch.The animation itself could have been better, but it was above average for a direct-to-video sequel from the 1990's. With just a little bit better animation, it could have easily been released to theaters. I don't think that was Disney's intent, though. So for what it was worth, it's an above average movie, and Robin Williams made the movie all the better by returning as the Genie.

I was not crazy about Timothy Dalton's first Bond outing, the 'Living Daylights'; it was an average entry in the series. But 'License to Kill' made for a bare-knuckled, one-two punch of a movie! Dispensing with much of the political intrigue and a lot of the gadgetry (ironic, since gadget-master Q, the wonderful Desmond Llewelyn, plays his lengthiest role to date), this Bond's tag-line should have been, This Time It's Personal (not to be confused with another late '80s shark attack film; the foul-smelling Jaws 4). 'Licence to Kill' sees Bond losing said license, while avenging the arranged shark-attack\/mutilation of former CIA (now DEA) ally and longtime friend, Felix Leiter (David Hedison, whose played the character in other Bond films). In addition to Leiter's near murder, his new bride is killed for his role in attempting to bring in international drug dealer Sanchez (Robert Davi; perhaps the most subtle Bond villain next to Mads Mikkelson's Le Chiffre in 2006's Casino Royale). Bond boss 'M' refuses to let 007 pursue the matter, so in haste, he resigns. Many Bond fans had a problem with this; I did not. In my opinion, it made for a more human Bond, to avenge his friend. And I believe it was totally in character (Bond HAS gone on vendettas before; the 'Diamonds are Forever' opening sequence, as well as the opener of 'For Your Eyes Only'; so THERE, Bond purists!). Aiding him in his quest are Carey Lowell as pilot-for-hire Pam Bouvier (doing a good turn as a Bond girl; sexy, smart and resourceful), as well as an 'on-leave' Q, in what is Q's largest and most helpful role to date (he finally works in the field; secretly aiding Bond in his quest). And lastly, the most important component in a Bond movie; James Bond 007 himself! Timothy Dalton plays the role in a similar way to most recent Bond, Daniel Craig (in the 2006 franchise re-boot, Casino Royale); as a somewhat moodier, darker Bond that bleeds, feels pain and uses his fists more than devices. He DOES use a few Q toys, but except for a lighter given to him by...well, Leiter (sorry about that), they are not central to the plot this time, as in other Bonds (especially in my least favorite entries of the series; the Roger Moore Bonds). Making Bond a rogue this time out makes his situation a little more perilous; he does not have an army of Her Majesty's finest troops or the United States Marine Corps to back him up. Just his wits, cunning and a couple of close allies. Having seen this film very recently after about 12 years or so, reminded me that this is one of the better Bonds, and that the far-too-easily dismissed Timothy Dalton did a wonderful turn as Bond; bringing the character back to his rugged roots (like early Connery, or even the promising new Bond Daniel Craig). License to Kill is a Bond stripped of duty to Queen and country, and replacing it with a thirst for vengeance. An equally powerful motive (if not more so) that fuels this top-of-the-line 007 adventure! And the tanker chase finale is spectacular!

And lastly, the most important component in a Bond movie; James Bond 007 himself! Timothy Dalton plays the role in a similar way to most recent Bond, Daniel Craig (in the 2006 franchise re-boot, Casino Royale); as a somewhat moodier, darker Bond that bleeds, feels pain and uses his fists more than devices. He DOES use a few Q toys, but except for a lighter given to him by...well, Leiter (sorry about that), they are not central to the plot this time, as in other Bonds (especially in my least favorite entries of the series; the Roger Moore Bonds). Making Bond a rogue this time out makes his situation a little more perilous; he does not have an army of Her Majesty's finest troops or the United States Marine Corps to back him up. Just his wits, cunning and a couple of close allies. Having seen this film very recently after about 12 years or so, reminded me that this is one of the better Bonds, and that the far-too-easily dismissed Timothy Dalton did a wonderful turn as Bond; bringing the character back to his rugged roots (like early Connery, or even the promising new Bond Daniel Craig). License to Kill is a Bond stripped of duty to Queen and country, and replacing it with a thirst for vengeance. An equally powerful motive (if not more so) that fuels this top-of-the-line 007 adventure! And the tanker chase finale is spectacular!

I was not crazy about Timothy Dalton's first Bond outing, the 'Living Daylights'; it was an average entry in the series. But 'License to Kill' made for a bare-knuckled, one-two punch of a movie! Dispensing with much of the political intrigue and a lot of the gadgetry (ironic, since gadget-master Q, the wonderful Desmond Llewelyn, plays his lengthiest role to date), this Bond's tag-line should have been, This Time It's Personal (not to be confused with another late '80s shark attack film; the foul-smelling Jaws 4). 'Licence to Kill' sees Bond losing said license, while avenging the arranged shark-attack\/mutilation of former CIA (now DEA) ally and longtime friend, Felix Leiter (David Hedison, whose played the character in other Bond films). In addition to Leiter's near murder, his new bride is killed for his role in attempting to bring in international drug dealer Sanchez (Robert Davi; perhaps the most subtle Bond villain next to Mads Mikkelson's Le Chiffre in 2006's Casino Royale). Bond boss 'M' refuses to let 007 pursue the matter, so in haste, he resigns. Many Bond fans had a problem with this; I did not. In my opinion, it made for a more human Bond, to avenge his friend.

The Tingler of 1959 is the second collaboration of the legendary director William Castle and Horror's greatest Icon, the immortal Vincent Price, and while the film does not quite reach the brilliance of the foregoing House On Haunted Hill from the same year, this is about as much fun as a film can get for a classic Horror fan. The film actually follows an extremely absurd and far-fetched storyline, but and Price's performance and Castle's film-making and brilliant scare-effects make this a must-see.Dr. Warren Chapin (Price), is a doctor and scientist who is researching the effects of fear with his assistant David Morris (Darryl Hickman). After long research concerning fear, Chapin is devoted to find something, what he is convinced exists in every human's body. The so-called 'Tingler', a mysterious creature that lives in human beings and feeds on their fear...The plot is absurd and sometimes goofy, and yet The Tingler is an effective film that is downright ingenious in many aspects. It must have been even greater to see this film in the theater back in the day, since William Castle was famous for frightening his audiences with certain gimmicks, such as skeletons flying through the halls. But even today and on the little screen, The Tingler has many great little details. There is one brilliant sequence, in which Castle mixes one color element into the otherwise black and white film. This ingenious sequence alone makes the film a must-see, and I'm sure it made many people scream back in 1959. Vincent Price is my favorite actor, and he once again delivers a brilliant performance in The Tingler. Supporting cast members Phillip Coolidge and Judith Evelyn are also great fun to watch. Story-wise The Tingler may be campy and absurd (which makes it even more fun), but Vincent Price in the lead and William Castle's effects and scare-tactics make it an absolute delight for my fellow lovers of classic Horror\/Sci-Fi cinema.

The picture with the knife and the Halloween mask on the front of the DVD didn't appeal to me as I thought that it was going to be another of those bloody meaningless slasher horror films. But the simple and little story line as a comment captivated my attention and made me curious about it,and also I had the strange feeling that the film but especially the music was going to be interesting. So I bought it and added it to my DVD collection. I watched it the first time three months ago and...how wrong I was about the impression over the cover picture on the DVD!! It turned out to be one of the best horror films I have ever watched! Tense from start to finish, with dense eerie atmosphere and creepy lighting and...obviously a suspenseful and captivating music! I watched again it last night with the thought that it would have probably been less tense or attractive following my first viewing only three months ago. How wrong I was again!! I had the same impact than the first time and find it perhaps more frightful than the first viewing!! The idea of Micheal never dying is purely evil! His terribly breathing still haunting the house and place at the end of the film very scary! I think John Carpenter has really made a great job here, considering I guess the low budget used and the ability to create a great horror slasher film with practically no blood (a part a little from the first scene when Micheal kills his sister) and no special effect. I'm not sure about the acting qualities of Donald Pleasence, but I think him and Jamie Lee Curtis to be perfectly cast in this film.I would recommend this film to any horror fan and not, but not to those who are easily disturbed or frightened. The music will be very likely lingering in your memory for a long time. My vote 8.5 out of 10!

It was very good that the movie-makers spend a little bit more of running time for this scene.

First of all, the dismissal of Tim Burton for Joel Schumacher had to be done; for after Mr. Burton's fast start in giving us a fine, dark representation of a grim, shadowy and avenging vigilante of the night in the initial BATMAN (Warner Brothers\/Polygram, 1989); he gave us the extremely pessimistic and outright depressing BATMAN RETURNS.From starting out with a great and exciting, though flawed origin story* in BATMAN, which at long last gave the public Mr. Jack Nicholson in his interpretation of The Joker, Burton's next entry with a some what lycanthropic Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and a gross, grotesque and totally depressing Penguin (Danny Divito) in a one picture twin-bill of Batman enemies. That would seem to have established this Tag-Team mentality in the Batman screen stories; as this was followed up with our victim today in BATMAN FOREVER with the troublesome twosome of Two Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and the Riddle (Jim Carrey). The ultimate installment, BATMAN AND ROBIN (Warners\/Polygram, 1997) featured Mr. Freeze (Arnold the Gubernator Schwarzenegger) and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) vs. the series # 3 Caped Crusader in George Clooney.But now back to BATMAN FOREVER; which is today's subject for our Roast. AS previously stated, the film was a sort of improvement over the previous outing. The two sub-plots were manned by two very different villains; both of whom cast long shadows in the entire overall picture of the Batman Saga. Former D.A. Harvey Dent aka Two-Face made a handful of appearances in the early 1940's, and was referred to many times, mainly in depiction of a huge Two-Face replica coin in the Batcave.After a sort of Luke-warm origin story in a 1948 Batman Story in Detective Comics Number 160, the Riddler (born Edward Nigma), only made one more appearance prior to the big New Look Batman revamp of 1964; after which he made plenty of appearances, culminating with the great and immortal portrayal of Riddler by the late Frank Gorshin on the BATMAN TV Series.** In BATMAN FOREVER, some heretofore unused aspects of the bad-guys were incorporated into the stories in order to give some more substance and density to the proceedings. It's sort of like making the broth of your soup thicker by using milk, flour and raw eggs into the soup. (Ummmm, ummmmm! Today was a real soup day in Chicago with temps in the 30's on the penultimate day of April.) The Riddler's story gains strength, length and gravitas (hey I just used that word for the first time!) by way of making Riddler some half-fast inventor at Wayne Enterprises working on some dream altering machine.The movie, while being far from a masterpiece, is amusing, entertaining and relatively close to being a comics-type story. The lack of pretension makes for a fine escapist 2 hours or so well spent.But in getting down to my pet peeve; being the unnecessary alteration of previously established comics fact. In this case, it is in relation to the birth name of Riddler. The Camp TV Series never once made mention of it; even though the very name, both given name and surname together, were responsible for his impulse of giving clues about his capers to his adversaries (Batman & Robin) .The birth name for the Riddler is Edward Nigma. When abbreviated using the first initial of E, it becomes, E.Nigma; with an enigma being something that is a truly puzzling situation. For some reason, the production crew chose to change the spelling from E. Nigma to E. Nymga. Why, you ask? We do have a theory.We think that in print, E. Nigma is too closely resembling to the N word. Just think about it. It's just another case of Political Correctness' and fear of being criticized having too much influence over too many a victim.NOTE * The story finely incorporates elements of both the first Joker story from Batman Comics No. 1 and the Joker origin some years later. And yet, they try to make the killer one young, sadistic thug, Jack Napier (the future Joker!!) as being the murderer of the Waynes. Any aficionado of Batman knows that the killer was small timer street thug, Joe Chill.NOTE ** We have a theory about the sudden rise in Riddler's Stock was due to his resemblance to Mr. Frank Gorshin; who was ever so popular then. Our guess is that in doing preparational research for the BATMAN TV Series, someone on the production team spotted the character in Comic Books File Copies in the D.C. Comics Editorial Offices, brought it to his superior's attention, and hence we had the same Bat Time, same Bat-History.POODLE SCHNITZ!!

Yet, it might have been a bit too brat packish if it turned into a pop soundtrack movie like Sixteen Candles or Breakfast Club or Weird Science, etc. This story was not all about goofiness and teen angst. It was more adult and there really were a lot of people who got into trouble with coke and crystal in those days. They were easy to spot when you stood back. I also found it easy to stop myself from going too far by maintaining high awareness of my own situation.

After that we just forget about the beat and is all a love story, quite predictable by the way, and even the main character ends in a point when even he won the money, he doesn't care because of the love. But in that entire decent love story there are many funny moments especially for the sexual maniac that is Kyle and for Michael's bad experiences with women, even if they look like a pretty innocent girl or if they are the grandma of the innocent girl Eventually we have a really enjoyable time with this film without expecting something. So I think this film is the kind that if you have the chance to watch it just for coincidence in TV it will be a good way to have 90 minutes of pure entertainment.

From the fantastic dialogue, the soundtrack to the acting to the editing, it is just the perfect package. A stand-out for me would have to be Tim Roth who, though on the floor for a large proportion of the film, excels in his role as does Steve Buscemi and the fantastically psychotic Michael Madsen.There is just so much to enjoy in this film, and yes, the violence and the swearing does play a big part but it is never gratuitous but rather, it enhances the characters'. For example, when Mr Orange (Roth) shoots the lady in the car and do I even need to mention the ear-cutting scene?Any person who calls themselves a film fanatic must see this film. It is, in my personal opinion, Tarentino's best and deservedly a modern classic. I just hope that I can eventually produce films as superlative as this one.

Cameron though does build up the tension excellently, enhancing the story and developing Weaver's iconic Ripley character while at the same time introducing a bunch of far more interesting characters rather than the simple fodder of the first film where the alien was the star of the show. They make the film entertaining, packing it with gung-ho machismo and bad-ass one liners but when the action comes it is, in my opinion, disappointing.The alien as we found out in the first film is a terrifying horror Sci-Fi invention but here it plays second-fiddle, becoming nothing more than an extra being blown away like a bad guy in a Schwarzenegger movie. Also Cameron seems to cut away from the best action so you don't have an idea what is going on half the time and the film's latter half spends most of the time building to the inevitable predictable narrative peril scenario. However, Cameron is no doubt a deft-hand at creating palpable claustrophobia and a grand-stand finale and in this sense Aliens doesn't disappoint.

I have watched it on numerous occasions for a long time now and I always think it is an incredibly fun and entertaining movie. The first time I watched it though was when I was around four years young. It was one of the first, as I called it then, scary movies I watched.I actually will never find the strength to call this film horrible, even though my opinions on it have of course lowered a lot over time, because I watched it when I was so little, and I thought it was the best movie ever. This film is still really enjoyable, because it's value doesn't decrease as much as the person who watches it entertainment does, but it still sickens me to know it has such a low rating and many look down on it, while really it should receive more appreciation.I might have lowered my opinions on this film, but it is still a pleasing film that does not deserve the rating it has. I didn't see much of anything wrong with it, even now, and I just thought it was suspenseful and exciting, somewhat more suspenseful than a lot of other movies that have been made, with a lot of fun performances and excellent CGI. Godzilla, yet classified as a horror\\suspense, was actually a touching film and was sad in some parts, as well. I will never understand how someone could hate a film that's just meant to be all around fun and enjoyment. It is still my favorite out of the original and newest remake.Two thumbs up for Godzilla.

I love Dane Cook, but if I were him, I would take this movie off my resume. Rodman should stick to basketball and the freak show, because he can not act. I won't say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen, because I have seen BloodSuckers (Michael Ironsides) and DogSoliders. But, like those movies, it is a train wreck, no matter how awful it gets you just can't stop watching it. The wire work was horrible. Rodman can't even pretend he knows martial arts, John Pinette's stunt double was more convincing than Rodman. One of my biggest pet peeves is poor movie editing. For instance, at the end of First Wives Club count how many different pairs of shoes Goldie Hawn is wearing in the last seen. I counted four different pairs. In this movie, can you count how many times Rodman's bike changes in a single scene. We counted four in the the first scene of the movie, an three in the scene where he is escaping the blast in the tunnel. Did anyone else notice that the dad in this was trying way to hard to look like Robert Redford? This movie isn't even good enough to become a cult classic.
