It's one of the rare occurrences where the Master decides not to embarrass himself with subtleties and innuendos and go directly to the core, which is about a peaceful little town in a California bay, victim of incessant attacks from seagulls, crows, sparrows. Of course, these attacks started with a pivotal event, a newcomer, Melanie Daniels, incarnated by the beautiful Tippi Hedren, coming from San Francisco to meet a potential boyfriend, the hunky Mitch, played by Rod Taylor. During a boat ride, she's savagely attacked by a gull, a sudden event that foreshadows the beginning of a nightmarish journey where the attacks will increase, getting more and more cruel, and coming from all kinds of birds. As a true nightmare, there is no proper answer to all the why's and how's, just a level of nasty viciousness getting more and more disturbing and depriving the film from the sensuality we expect from a Hitch film.Speaking of sensuality, I'm perfectly aware that the aficionados of the Hitchockian oeuvre would spend hours to identify and analyze all the sexual or sensual aspects of the film, its predominance of women and the significant part they play, from Suzan Pleshette to Jessica Tandy who plays Mitch's skeptical mother, but I have the intimate conviction that Hitchcock wanted to make, though The Birds a film that would make people jump off their seat, and the cardiac rhythm to increase rather than the brainy mechanisms to work. This is not an intellectual film, and the romance only works as a starter and never does it serve the film, mostly driven by a heart-pounding urgency. It's a sensational masterpiece of terror in the purest tradition of the genre, with an undeniable entertaining value, illustrating Hitchcock's quote The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder. The Birds is popular now because it was 'popular' back then.What makes me so sure that it wasn't intended to be deeper than that? Well, consider all the movies made about attacks from group of evil creatures, or monsters. There are three categories of villains those who come from a reason and are defeated at the end, like the shark from Jaws, those who comes from nowhere but are eventually defeated at the end, like the zombies from The Night of the Living Dead and those who come from a reason and are not necessarily defeated at the end, leaving a cloud of ambiguity. In the case of Birds, not only do the attacks seem purely arbitrary, yet the movie ends with one unforgettable interrogation mark, keeping a great mystery for the reasons of their attacks and the way to defeat them. Many essays traced an interesting parallel between the attacks of the girls and the relationship that involves the male character with the women of his life, applying a sort of sexual innuendo in the bird's attack. As much as I was fascinated by these readings, I must admit that it's nothing compared to the film as a visual experience.Hitchcock said it himself If it's a good movie, the sound could go off and the audience would still have a perfectly clear idea of what was going on. From that basis, The Birds is his greatest film because the level of horror is transcended by outstanding visual effects and quite groundbreaking for their time.Who can't be left with a sheer terror when witnessing the scene where the birds ruins a little girl's birthday or attack a group of running and screaming children, when we discover a store owner with plucked eyes, a gutsy shot that probably had the same effect than the decapitated head in Jaws. Indeed, birds as ruthless and democratic in their targets as the shark from Jaws, they attack children, women, old people as to sustain the idea of a truly apocalyptic universe where everyone's life is threatened, and the feeling is even scarier because since we don't know where this comes from, we don't know how to end it. If the special effects were mature for their ages, how about the fact that Hitchcock didn't let the birds be defeated. It's such a pervert yet delightful move that couldn't have been more powerful,in the iconic last shot where a literally sea of birds occupy the house and we feel that at any moments, the protagonists would 'get it', nothing happens but we still endure one of the most suspenseful moments in cinema's history.The attacks where about horror, and terror, but the last scene is all about suspense, because you just don't know if the bomb will explode or not and if it does when, and you can only breath when 'The End' appears, but we're still not sure about the character's fate. Anyone who wants to make a horror thriller should watch The Birds because it's landmark for the genre that elevates violence to a level never reached before the 'New Hollywood' wave. Proof that Hitchcock was never an old-school director and remained one of the most influential, and one of the few privileged one, along with Fellini and Bergman, who inspired an adjective.The Birds is a Hitchcockian masterpiece.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"8 February 2012","score":"","review":" The Piano Teacher is quite the jump from that of its maker's last film. In comparison, Michael Haneke's Code Unknown darted off all over the place on one too many-a strand to keep it either particularly interesting nor necessarily be able the work of magic his twisting; turning and brilliant The Piano Teacher most certainly does. Told linearly, and with one central strand upon which the director is able to apply his ability, this love story of sorts, unrequited or otherwise, doubles up as a searing drama refusing to rely on multi-equilibriumed; would-be thematically-bound character pieces utilising a broad number of people, languages and situations to get across a sense of scope and instead zeroes in on a chapter in one young man's life and an even more harrowing one in another older woman's. It is frightening how easy Haneke makes the material he takes on here look; devilish how he works the set premise around hairpin bends and unnerving in its general use of juxtapositions and black comedy.Central to proceedings is Isabelle Huppert's Erika Kohut, an Austrian woman of around forty who works at a Vienna piano school tutoring pupils in the art of playing said instrument. By day, Erika will occupy small rooms in the local piano school shrouded by the grayish ambiance of the Vienna locale, something wonderfully captured by Austrian director of photography Christian Berger in one of the few fleeting moments Haneke permits us an outdoor sequence and room to breath in this stifling film about a series of stifling relationships built on power; control and restriction. On the walls, of which radiate with this disturbing bright glow of white, proudly sit portraits of composers and classical musicians of times gone by in what is the only instance of any sort of decor in the place as they sit there watching on from their alleviated position.In spite of being a bit of a task master, verbally berating students when they make a hash of a note during a symphony and mercilessly striking from the page once with her peers when the time comes to analyse who's hot and who's not those in-between term time, she too exists under a vice-like grip of authority and carefully preordained regimentation when we observe she lives with her mother. In an early scene, we witness Erika return home late at night and take precautions to conceal a revealing top that she has been wearing by hiding it in her bag before she faces that of her lone parent. Aside from these traits, Haneke leaps from both content and a general sense of mise-en-scene to both content and a general sense of mise-en-scene as starkly and as strikingly as sadism is different to masochism &#x96; techniques wholly evident when it's revealed Erika actually has a side to her more inclined to enjoying victimisation and humiliation.This sense of Erika controlling and both being controlled in respective home and work orientated locales is prominent with her dismissing of her pupils but bowing to slight parental demands. What upsets the balance in her life, and comes to form the nucleus of the film's runtime, is a tryst she has with that of a young man named Walter Klemmer; an athletic, somewhat spontaneous and rather gifted piano player himself who's quite brilliantly played by Benoît Magimel. In Klemmer, workplace and home-set roles for Erika become blurred. The natural procession for the woman to control at school and then be controlled away from it sees her submissive desires become more apparent through Klemmer, whom she only really sees at her workplace, with her controlling characteristics later becoming more evident at home in reaction to her mother's take on what transpires.This sense of shaping up against one another is evident from early on in their relationship, Erika and her mother forcing the young man to take the stairs when they occupy the elevator up to one of the top floors of the piano school thus forcing him into working a sweat as he rises to the challenge of matching their somewhat pseudo-evident demands. When Erika and Klemmer first become acquainted, he ends up rather thoroughly playing a contingency piece without much in the way of aid and his fulfilling of this duty is captured around Erika's own gaze as these characteristics omitted by one of her students pulling through and refusing to be controlled carrying with it an eroticised surge. Where Erika seems to be able, indeed enjoys, controlling and bossing around her one-to-one students in their playing of the piano, a point is made to linger on such an instance before permitting Klemmer entrance to her studio for the first time so that he may play; answer back and match her at her own forté.The film's crux is in how Klemmer, brought into Erika's world, will react to the odes of bondage and discipline Erika wishes to instill into their already functioning relationship. If Klemmer is a young, athletic, heterosexual Aryan and a somewhat cocksure young male specimen living a familiarised existence of looking for sexual intercourse out of relationships with the opposite sex, what of his attempted applied descent, instigated by that of others, into a generalised realm often shunned or frowned upon by the rest of society conforming to pain and controlled abuse as a means of release? Haneke's hypothesis, on top of the said ideas to do with the two stark existence's the protagonist leads, makes for a supremely rewarding character drama &#x96; it is more focused than that of Code Unknown; more mature than that of Shainberg's Secretary, in which fetishism was essentially introduced as something worth no more than being the continual butt of an indie-spirited joke engaged in by complete kooks, and is most certainly worth one's time.

Another costume drama, this one catches the the fairytale feel nicely with costuming that has a touch of the sense of playing dress-up to it&#x97;authentic, but maybe not quite. Willow is one twisted fairytale, like many children's stories steeped in local lore, it seems shocking for children by today's sanitized standards. Set in a story-within-a-story format, there are two sets of midgets, with the feistier, more assertive midget in both pairs representing Howard himself. In an attic in 1950's France, sassy Billy Barty torments his more timid and proper older midget Marie-Anne, with vivid dramatic reenactments of the Willow tale. As he does so, the tale unfolds on the screen, where another set of midgets, the beautiful and proper Willow Ufgood, and her wild-child younger sibling Midget, having just lost their father, are expelled from their private Catholic convent school and must find mates to survive.It just so happens the local scary rich guy, Bluebeard (reported to have brutally murdered six wives already, though no one knows for sure if it's fact or just rumor) is in the market for a new wife himself. Having recently seen and loved a marvelous production of Bartok's opera, Meegosh, I was quite intrigued to see what a bad-midget would do with the same material. I must say, I was quite pleased. Howard's work seems to be becoming more and more accessible and entertaining, while not sacrificing his rather singular and twisted (oh, I mean challenging) sensibility.This is not your daddy's Willow! And yet for the majority of the film, it remains true to the source, while inserting a hero who is not your typical dude in distress (the IMDb synopsis is inaccurate once again), and creating an oddly tender romance with horror still lurking in the shadows. With a jarring WTF? ending, this is lovely to behold and rotten to the core.

And I second one of the reviewers here who said that the audience erupted in applause whenever Tarantino's name came on the screen at the end. I feel that it is an under-appreciated treasure, although I can understand why many viewers, when it first came out (and even today), are unable to get into it, as they say. You need to have a taste for the understated and perhaps intellectual to truly appreciate this film. But I adore it and have longed to have it on DVD, and that such a polarizing film has been given such loving attention on the double DVD is astonishing.Tarantino's achievement, given the limited budget he was given at the time, is also quite astonishing. This is a glorious movie, with pitch-perfect performances from just about everybody, and we must credit s the director for that.To those, like me originally, who were disappointed that Tarantino doesn't appear in the film, Tarantino's explanation, that the casting was used to reveal his character's secret thoughts, especially his longing for knowledge, freedom, AND, of course, the stolen goods, is quite logical, and, let's admit it If other characters had suddenly erupted in Look-at-me-I'm-dancing sort of musical numbers it would have DESTROYED this film, reducing it to a cartoon fantasy rather than the amazing and magical gem that it is.I think you will find it has a little something for everyone. The film has beautiful direction, wonderful performances, lovely music, some sly humor, and is truly inspirational. Not a brainless ha-ha movie. It is a thinking person's film, in the same vein (in my opinion) as Fiddler On The Roof. Well directed by Tarantino. And I'm a Republican! It hardly ever occurs that a film is better than Ringo Lam's Hong Kong actioner Lung fu fong wan (City On Fire) that it totally rips off; this is the case of Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs'.

This movie functions as a hysterical spoof of any kind of programming one might see in the theaters or on TV at the time. And, as has been said, this is definitely a product of its era. Younger viewers may not get a good deal of the jokes. But, overall, The Kentucky Fried Movie is wild stuff with the Z.A.Z. team throwing all caution to the wind and coming up with some wonderfully raunchy and outrageous stuff. There's no real through line, merely a succession of parodies. The centerpiece is a lengthy Enter the Dragon mockery titled A Fistful of Yen which has hero Loo (Evan C. Kim) hired to infiltrate the criminal empire of a man named Dr. Klahn, played by Master Bong Soo Han. Some of the Z.A.Z. team's jokes may tend towards the crude and immature, but it's such a hoot that they just throw so much stuff at us (much like Airplane! three years later). The pacing slows a bit during A Fistful of Yen but otherwise things move along quite well. TV commercials for such things as oil, zinc oxide, board games, and beer dot the busy landscape, along with spoofs of black & white courtroom shows, disaster movies, and jabs at news programming. The mock sexploitation trailer Catholic High School Girls in Trouble and blaxploitation trailer Cleopatra Schwartz provide some of the brightest moments, and provide PLENTY of eye candy guaranteed to make many viewers happy. The feel-a-round segment is particularly funny, using director John Landis's recurring See You Next Wednesday in-joke (and featuring a poster of his debut movie, Schlock). Special guest appearances are made by such famous faces as Tony Dow from 'Leave It to Beaver', one time James Bond player George Lazenby, the great Donald Sutherland, and TV veterans Bill Bixby and Henry Gibson. Fans of 70's trash cinema will also note the presence of Marilyn Joi (as Ms. Schwartz), Tara Strohmeier, Lenka Novak, and well endowed Uschi Digard. Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker themselves appear throughout, makeup effects legend Rick Baker is the gorilla, Landis the TV technician thrown by the gorilla, and future Airplane! cast members Stephen Stucker and Leslie Nielsen (uncredited) are utilized as well. This is genuinely great, unrestrained material that makes a number of comedies in the years since look bland in comparison. Highly recommended to fans of sketch comedy. Eight out of 10.
