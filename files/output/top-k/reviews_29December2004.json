Most of his best work represents a different type of thriller, and The Birds is no different. It is often said that Psycho is Hitchcock's first foray into the horror side of the thriller, and it is indeed; but it's not the complete horror film that The Birds is. Often cited as an obvious influence for Night of the Living Dead, The Birds follows Melanie Daniels as she travels to the seaside town of Bodega Bay with a pair of lovebirds for Mitch Brenner, an eligible bachelor that she met in a pet shop in San Francisco. However, while there the birds of the coastal town begin to attack the residents and so begins a terrifying tale of man's feathered friends waging a war against humanity...It could be said that the plot of The Birds is ridiculous, and it is. The idea of birds, a type of animal that isn't aggressive, attacking humans despite living with us for millions of years is preposterous and is never likely to happen. However; it is here where the film's horror potency lies. Birds live with us in harmony; we're so used to them that for the most part we don't even realise that they're there, and the idea of something that we don't notice suddenly becoming malicious is truly terrifying. Especially when that something is unstoppable, as the birds are portrayed as being in this film. The fact that the birds' motive is never really explained only serves in making it more terrifying, as it would appear that somewhere along the line they've just decided to attack. Of course, the film could be interpreted as having Melanie's arrival, or the presence of the lovebirds as the cause for it all; but we don't really know. This bounds the film in reality as if there was a reason given, it might be improbable; but there's no true reason given (although there are several theories), so it can't be improbable! The first forty minutes of the film feature hardly any - if any - horror at all. Hitchcock spends this part of the movie developing the characters and installing their situation in the viewers' minds, so that when the horror does finally come along, it has a definite potency that it would not have had otherwise. In fact, at first the birds themselves come across as a co-star in their own movie as there are brief references towards them, but they never get their full dues. However, once the horror does start, it comes thick and fast. Hitchcock, the master craftsman as always, uses his famous montage effects and never really shows you anything; but because you're being bombarded with so many different shots, you'd never realise it. Many people have tried to copy this technique, but most have failed. Hitchcock, however, has it down to an art and this is maybe the film that shows off that talent the best. There are numerous moments of suspense as well, many of which are truly nail biting. We see the birds amassing and ready to strike - but they don't. And this is much more frightening than showing an attack from the off. Hitchcock knows this. The final thirty minutes of The Birds is perhaps the most thrilling of his entire oeuvre. First, Hitchcock gives us an intriguing situation where numerous inhabitants of the town give their views on the events, and also explains the birds' situation with humans, even giving the audience an angle of expertise from an ornithologist's point of view. He then follows it up with a truly breathtaking sequence of horror that hasn't been matched since for relentless shock value.Hitchcock has made many great films, and this certainly stands up as one of them.

Granted, in horror movies, special effects can really make the movie quite visually spectacular and altogether aid in entertainment, but when you're short on story, you're just short on story, plain and simple.Following something like 'Rosemary's Baby' (which this film clearly resembles in the final scenes when Martin Sheen is trying to save his boy from a cult of weirdos in a warehouse), this is the story of a group of people in a voodoo cult, and particularly, they're after one man's son for their next ritual. (If you don't happen to understand what the heck is going on through most of the movie, don't worry, they pretty much save any real explanation--and hints thereof--till the finale scene in those just-in-case-we-didn't-explain-it-well closing dialogs). Martin Sheen, therefore, has to figure out why all these people are dying and what exactly it has to do with him and his son. Of course, they turned a relatively smart guy into a blithering idiot, since he doesn't seem to make the connection fast enough that the people he knew and that he comes in contact with are dying, usually horribly violent deaths. That is, until the end, when it is almost too late to do anything.Again, the filmmakers spend far too much time trying to gross the viewers out with extremely graphic death scenes. Not but three minutes into the film, Sheen's wife (Janet-Lane Greene) is electrocuted for a good minute to a horribly grim death. If you can stand that, you can probably stand the rest of the attempted gross out sequences in the remainder of the film. You'll have to, since there is not much else going on. All of these characters appear to struggle with one another, but none of them have any real sense of what is going on (save the later voodoo jargon that may bore you to death), so you don't get much to go on either. That is really a shame, too, considering the potential of such a tremendous cast which also includes Richard Masur, Robert Loggia, Jimmy Smits (in a good part), and young Harley Cross doing a fine job as Martin Sheen's son (but that is not surprising, if you have seen 'Cohen and Tate').It's a like it or leave it kind of movie.

The dialogue is tortuous, with long, drawn out scenes between the two leads that seem to have little point or direction. Whilst the quality of the film is greatly enhanced by the digital remastering, the soundtrack fares rather poorly in comparison and so to make matters worse, the piece is filled with a screeching score and shrill dialogue that is rather akin to listening to somebody running a metal glove down a blackboard. Emotionally, I could make no attachment to the film\u2019s characters, whatsoever. The initial tragedy of Christine\u2019s death occurs and is then swept aside as the action shifts to Venice almost without feeling or note. We have no concept of how much time has transpired, so we have no real indication of how much time has passed that might have healed the mental wounds. Both John and Laura seem unaffected, despite the fact that Laura\u2019s mood subsequently lifts when some supernatural contact appears to have been made with her dead daughter. John seems detached and, frankly, rather disinterested and this is a state of emotion that quickly rubs off on the audience.The trouble with the long scenes of dialogue is that you find yourself looking for a hidden meaning that ultimately doesn\u2019t exist. One of the film\u2019s most famous (or should that be infamous?) scenes is a sex scene between the two leads, Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie. Film history tells us that the film was allegedly after an initial version had been made because the director felt that the couple were spending too much time on screen arguing. You can certainly tell that the film was something of an afterthought. I have certainly never seen a clumsier, and less sexy sex scene in my life, despite its rather explicit content. As Sutherland and Christie writhed and pumped I could only really liken the whole experience to that moment when Ken and Dierdre had a bit of a snog on Coronation Street. Gross.It\u2019s worth noting that not an awful lot happens in this film. It\u2019s a film based on suggestion and imagery. The director is intent on injecting the colour red throughout the film. Initially, John knocks over a bottle of bright red ink onto a camera slide that seems to signify the death of his daughter who drowns in a bright red rain coat. From there on in, the red is everywhere \u2013 in the crowds, in the cafes, and in virtually every scene involving Sutherland or Christie. Its significance is either utterly obvious or fiendishly subtle, but in either case dreadfully uninteresting. Even the apparent beauty of Venice is lost upon the dull script that wends its way through the drawn out film like a dead body floating along the canals.Sutherland looks extremely odd in this film as he has done in every other film he has ever made, to be perfectly honest. This certainly helps. His glaring eyes and frightened expressions certainly do their best to draw the audience in, even if they have already either nodded off or left the room. Julie Christie is frightfully frightful and tries just as hard, but points never were awarded for effort and her input is soon lost. The only rather interesting character is that of the blind sister, who looks and sounds rather sinister throughout and will certainly provide opportunity for cataract-inspired nightmares in young and old alike.Don\u2019t Look Now strikes me as a film that has aged rather poorly. Interestingly enough, there were many things in this film that reminded me of The Exorcist, a film that was also released in 1973. Both films have the same dark, lifeless tone. Both films contain priests that seem to know more than they\u2019re letting on and both films feature lots of religious imagery. In some ways, the conclusion to both films also feels rather similar. As a horror film, The Exorcist is infinitely more successful. Even now, the film is terrifying to the core and holds its own against modern-day counterparts. Indeed, if you\u2019re looking for scares, then I would suggest you look elsewhere \u2013 Don\u2019t Look Now\u2019s 15-certificate is more likely to have been awarded based on its sexual content than any real horror.There are many who will disagree with me, but Don\u2019t Look Now bored the pants off me. This is not what I call a classic film. It\u2019s what I call boring old dirge. Don\u2019t Look Now? Don\u2019t Look Ever, would be my advice.

Film history tells us that the film was allegedly after an initial version had been made because the director felt that the couple were spending too much time on screen arguing. You can certainly tell that the film was something of an afterthought. I have certainly never seen a clumsier, and less sexy sex scene in my life, despite its rather explicit content. As Sutherland and Christie writhed and pumped I could only really liken the whole experience to that moment when Ken and Dierdre had a bit of a snog on Coronation Street. Gross.It\u2019s worth noting that not an awful lot happens in this film. It\u2019s a film based on suggestion and imagery. The director is intent on injecting the colour red throughout the film. Initially, John knocks over a bottle of bright red ink onto a camera slide that seems to signify the death of his daughter who drowns in a bright red rain coat. From there on in, the red is everywhere \u2013 in the crowds, in the cafes, and in virtually every scene involving Sutherland or Christie. Its significance is either utterly obvious or fiendishly subtle, but in either case dreadfully uninteresting. Even the apparent beauty of Venice is lost upon the dull script that wends its way through the drawn out film like a dead body floating along the canals.Sutherland looks extremely odd in this film as he has done in every other film he has ever made, to be perfectly honest. This certainly helps. His glaring eyes and frightened expressions certainly do their best to draw the audience in, even if they have already either nodded off or left the room. Julie Christie is frightfully frightful and tries just as hard, but points never were awarded for effort and her input is soon lost. The only rather interesting character is that of the blind sister, who looks and sounds rather sinister throughout and will certainly provide opportunity for cataract-inspired nightmares in young and old alike.Don\u2019t Look Now strikes me as a film that has aged rather poorly. Interestingly enough, there were many things in this film that reminded me of The Exorcist, a film that was also released in 1973. Both films have the same dark, lifeless tone. Both films contain priests that seem to know more than they\u2019re letting on and both films feature lots of religious imagery. In some ways, the conclusion to both films also feels rather similar. As a horror film, The Exorcist is infinitely more successful. Even now, the film is terrifying to the core and holds its own against modern-day counterparts.

The dialogue is tortuous, with long, drawn out scenes between the two leads that seem to have little point or direction. Whilst the quality of the film is greatly enhanced by the digital remastering, the soundtrack fares rather poorly in comparison and so to make matters worse, the piece is filled with a screeching score and shrill dialogue that is rather akin to listening to somebody running a metal glove down a blackboard. Emotionally, I could make no attachment to the film\u2019s characters, whatsoever. The initial tragedy of Christine\u2019s death occurs and is then swept aside as the action shifts to Venice almost without feeling or note. We have no concept of how much time has transpired, so we have no real indication of how much time has passed that might have healed the mental wounds.

Do we ever see him using his remarkably elastic limbs? The answer to all these questions, of course, is no. The writer's simply drop in a character named Dhalsim just for the sake of saying they included him. The movie's failing is in its desperation to include every single character to the detriment of the rest of the film.

Hooker'd rather ice Lonnegan outright, but will settle for a big con with the help of a slightly wobbly but game scammer named Henry Gondorff, played as only Paul Newman can.Newman and Redford, along with director George Roy Hill, had a lot riding on this pony, given it was a follow-up to their earlier Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid. To measure up, they had to produce nothing short of another classic. And so they did. The Sting won the Best Picture Oscar in 1973, and remains the sentimental favorite among many in choosing between the two films.Comparing The Sting to Butch Cassidy is kind of overdone sport, and tempers, as Lonnegan would say, run hot. But you can see why The Sting worked as well as it did by looking at how the director and the stars played it differently within the same basic framework as Butch Cassidy. Newman and Redford are again outlaws and underdogs. Period detail abounds here as it did with Butch Cassidy, and there's another memorable score amid the proceedings, Scott Joplin rags modernized by Marvin Hamlisch. The score even produced another hit, The Entertainer, to compare with Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head.What's different about The Sting, and what makes it such a classic in its own right, is the way the stars service the plot. In Butch Cassidy, Newman and Redford's comradeship was the story. Here, the chemistry between the two actors is minimized in favor of spinning a yarn with enough red herrings to feed the Swedish navy. The tale here is better than Butch Cassidy, which is a more elegiac film with grander cinematography and funnier set pieces. The Sting is an edge-of-your-seat caper flick from beginning to end.You can't really call The Sting a comedy. Though there are many laughs, especially when Newman hooks Shaw during a poker game, Hill won't let the audience relax enough for that. What this is is a con game, played on the audience, designed not to cheat but entertain by means of clever hoodwinking and constant misdirection plays.You'll get no spoilers from me. This is one worth sitting through with no expectations. Five gets you ten you'll enjoy Newman and Redford, and a terrific supporting cast (one advantage over Butch Cassidy) that includes Charles Durning, Eileen Brennan, Dana Elcar, Harold Gould, and Mr. Hand himself, Ray Walston. There's another familiar face from Butch Cassidy, Charles Dierkop, Flat Nose Curry in Butch Cassidy and Lonnegan's right hand here. The best performance may be Robert Shaw's; he exudes menace aplenty but some humanity, too, when he takes Hooker under his wing after learning he came from the same hard streets of Five Points Lonnegan sprang from.Terrific period detail, too. The dialogue is great and feels real in its Runyonesque way, while the cons are elaborate and logically played out. Watching this a second time is especially fun because once you know how the plot goes down, you find yourself catching clues you missed the first time, and enjoying the film even more for them.Why didn't Newman and Redford team up again? Certainly there was another good movie for them to partner up in, but as Gondorff would have put it, only chumps don't quit when they're ahead.

Hooker'd rather ice Lonnegan outright, but will settle for a big con with the help of a slightly wobbly but game scammer named Henry Gondorff, played as only Paul Newman can.Newman and Redford, along with director George Roy Hill, had a lot riding on this pony, given it was a follow-up to their earlier Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid. To measure up, they had to produce nothing short of another classic. And so they did. The Sting won the Best Picture Oscar in 1973, and remains the sentimental favorite among many in choosing between the two films.Comparing The Sting to Butch Cassidy is kind of overdone sport, and tempers, as Lonnegan would say, run hot. But you can see why The Sting worked as well as it did by looking at how the director and the stars played it differently within the same basic framework as Butch Cassidy. Newman and Redford are again outlaws and underdogs. Period detail abounds here as it did with Butch Cassidy, and there's another memorable score amid the proceedings, Scott Joplin rags modernized by Marvin Hamlisch. The score even produced another hit, The Entertainer, to compare with Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head.What's different about The Sting, and what makes it such a classic in its own right, is the way the stars service the plot. In Butch Cassidy, Newman and Redford's comradeship was the story. Here, the chemistry between the two actors is minimized in favor of spinning a yarn with enough red herrings to feed the Swedish navy. The tale here is better than Butch Cassidy, which is a more elegiac film with grander cinematography and funnier set pieces. The Sting is an edge-of-your-seat caper flick from beginning to end.You can't really call The Sting a comedy. Though there are many laughs, especially when Newman hooks Shaw during a poker game, Hill won't let the audience relax enough for that. What this is is a con game, played on the audience, designed not to cheat but entertain by means of clever hoodwinking and constant misdirection plays.You'll get no spoilers from me.

A sci-fi adventure that, from the trailers, was like nothing I'd ever seen before. Until then, the best that sci-fi had shown me was Star Trek.I counted down the days until it came out and then, one fateful day in the summer, I went to see it. In the queue, I met up with a friend who'd also gone to see the movie alone. So we got tickets and sat together someplace in the middle of the rows. Whilst we waited for the movie to start we, like everyone else there, discussed what we knew of the film, what trailers we'd seen etc..Then the lights dimmed and as the curtains (they had real fancy ones in those days!) drew back from the screen, the 20th Century Fox logo appeared and the signature tune burst into life with deafening loudness.From that moment on I sat open-mouthed, like everyone else, as the film unfolded before us. There were no mobile phones in those days to annoy you, no sniggering teens in the back rows. There were teens, of course, but they were as raptly enthralled as everyone else. In the rare quiet moments of the film, the silence in the auditorium spoke volumes as to what we were bearing witness to - to what we were becoming a part of. The friend whom I was sitting with faded into the darkness - we never exchanged one word during the whole film. Afterwards, as we left, both of us were strangely subdued. The film had stunned us so much that mere words could not begin to explain how we felt. It was almost as if we wanted to savour the moment, as if we knew that such a perfect afternoon's entertainment would never come again. And we'd be right.To say that Star Wars changed my life may seem a conceit. The movie offered nothing more than (for a 13 year old) a fantastic couple of hours entertainment that you wished could go on forever. But it's true nonetheless. For Star Wars, unlike the dry and dreary sci-fi flicks of the time such as Silent Running and Zardoz, offered one thing that no film until then had managed.It opened doors to the imagination. From that point on no movie need be limited by the constraints of the movie-making process. Anything was possible. Of course, it wouldn't be until the advent of CGI that this promise could truly be fulfilled, but after Star Wars, nothing was the same again.My only complaint against Star Wars is that it is no longer available in the original theatre release version. Mr Lucas' Special Edition of the film, though adding much to the movie, also (in my humble opinion) took just as much away. The Special Edition looks slicker, nicer, more complete. But my memories won't let go of the original version, which had such a profound effect upon me. The Special Edition version, whilst fantastic, just doesn't look right to me. To me it's as if the original has been supplanted by some Doppleganger. It may look the same on the surface but......it isn't same.This is perhaps the only time I've ever thought a special version of the film was worse than the original. So here's my hope - that the original version will be released on DVD too. I can't be the only one who would want that, can I? In the rest of my life to date only a few films have ever come close to matching that sense of awe and excitement - Jurassic Park, Aliens and The Fellowship of the Ring. And even they, whilst great films in their own right, do not come that close.But don't take my word for it, go and watch it yourself. Today, of course, it shows its age, and everyone is used to films with huge scope and effects. For those who saw it originally as I did - as a kid at the dawn of FX cinema - I probably don't need to go on. For those who have not seen it - why not? In my other reviews I sometimes pour scorn on movies, scripts, SFX, acting - you name it. Sometimes even I think I can be a little harsh at times. But if I am it's because bad movies shouldn't be made anymore. If they could get it right in 1977, shouldn't they all be great films now? My benchmark for judging other films are the memories of a 13 year old kid. Is it any wonder nothing can live up to them? The only parting comment I'll make about Star Wars is to recommend you see it on a big screen if at all possible. Nothing like that should ever be show on a 14 portable with mono sound. Some films demand a cinema, or at the very least a hefty plasma TV with surround sound. Nothing else will ever do it justice.Enjoy!

Also, Bakshi decided to change the name Saruman to Aruman, because he thought the former would look too much like Sauron and people would get confused. Only, Bakshi uses both Aruman and Saruman, which is ten times more confusing than the original name could ever be. But my biggest gripe has to be milking the giant cow. This acting term means using gestures that are inappropriately big. And Bakshi loves doing that!

It is devoid of twists or needlessly flashy film-making&#151;it just tells a story from beginning to the end, and all the while keeps you very entertained with great acting, dialog and various indescribable nuances.The story revolves around a family in a small California town (interesting note the movie was made in 1943 yet there's no mention of the war. I think this helps preserve the feeling of small town isolation). The oldest daughter named Charlie is bored with her family's ho-hum life. Then, UNCLE Charlie comes to town (played magnificently by Joseph Cotton) because he wants to settle down, but to the viewer it seems like he's running away from something. He has a lot of cash and wants to open a bank account. Two men have been carefully following him since the beginning of the film. I'm not going to give away any more because it's pretty cool.What was so stunning about this movie is that we as modern movie enthusiasts expect a good movie to have something hidden, something up its sleeve. Well, this one doesn't, which is a fresh change for us modern types. A remake would be impossible--modern audiences would consider it tame. However, the story excels within the confines of its time. Any remake would be a joke.The family is very interesting to observe. The little girl Anne almost steals the show. She's literate and unintentionally snobby&#151;like a nine-year-old Ayn Rand. The father is kind of aloof and simple&#151;he and his neighbor friend are constantly talking about the science of committing murders, which serves as a great backdrop to the suspense going on right under their noses.Thornton Wilder wrote it.

When Michael the oldest of the two brothers falls for a young girl that hangs around the group, he is immediately drawn into their circle. Soon his younger brother finds that his sibling is acting much like the vampires that he is reading about in comics, a little too much! He sleeps in the day time, gets attacked by the family dog. And has an uncanny ability to fly outside his bedroom window etc. But when Michael finds out what he has become & what his new found friends really are, he tries to take his new found girlfriend out of the group. But the group is not about to let them go so easily. Soon Michael has to team up with his younger brother & two teen vampire hunters called the Frog Brothers, whom despite being brave & cocky don't know as much about vampires as they think. Now Michael has to kill the leader of the vampires in order to once again render him & his girlfriend human.

Therefore, I must say that everything that is good about the film succeeds only because of its stellar predecessor, and thus its relevance is somewhat negated.If you haven't seen the series then you will be of the belief that (the movie) 'Traffic' is the absolute bee's knees of gritty, uncompromising, documentary-style drama. By comparison, however, it comes across as being distinctly overly-slick. It looks a lot more impressive on the surface than it does when subjected to closer analysis. But I will make more pointed comment on Steven Soderbergh's directorial style later.Further, I must say that I prefer the England-Germany-Pakistan nexus of the series above the US-Mexico one, which seems to me to be something not nearly as fascinating, although obviously of more direct concern to an American audience. Not only does the series, which explores Western involvement, or interference or meddling, if you prefer, in Central Asia - Afghanistan included - have a lot to say about the realities of illegal drug manufacturing and distribution, but it also is timely (relative to current events) in its condemnation of Western governments' hypocrisies concerning Geo-political matters within the region. It makes very clear that Drugs and War, or Drugs and Power, have been, and always will be, uncomfortably close bedfellows. To my mind this extra layering makes the series far more substantial than the movie, which ultimately comes across as little more than fleetingly stimulating entertainment (although quite impressive on a superficial level), when all is said and done.Of course 'Traffic' - as a self-contained film - does not have the luxury to extrapolate to the degree of the series. Actually, at this point, I would have to give the screenwriter some praise for condensing the salient moments from the series in such a way as to retain its overall impact - even if in, what I consider, a relatively less satisfying package. Regarding Steven Soderbergh's effort as director, I must say that I feel that his style, whilst unquestionably sleek and accomplished, strikes me as far too glossy at times. In fact it was probably at the time that this film was released that I was beginning to become more than a little bored by his signature film-making style, despite my admiration for previous efforts like 'Out of Sight' (best Elmore Leonard adaptation) and 'The Limey'. I am of the opinion that Soderbergh is getting just a little too slick, and perhaps even self-consciously 'cool' for his own good. There are times when I find his trademark jump-cut editing style, 'Nouvelle Vague' affectations and conceitedly underplayed performance coaching just too distracting. I find it a little egotistically self-congratulatory, even as much as I admire the technical skill and sensibility to pull it off. In many ways I would like him to start to bring some rougher edges into his directorial style - to put a little immediacy and 'mongrel' into it, as it were. It would make material of this nature a lot more earthy and credible.All in all 'Traffic' is typically accomplished and flawlessly-polished edu-tainment from Steven Soderbergh, yet not as deep or challenging as it might first appear.

I am talking about mental illness and how destructive any of them can be to individuals that get it. I have been affected by both depression and a mild case of schizophrenia (the illness that is shown here) and the highs and lows that come with those illnesses. This film is important as shows what it takes to overcome a mental illness and what affects they can have on your life and those around you. A funny, haunting love story, 'Angel Baby' tells the story of two lost souls, Harry and Kate, who fall in love against the odds and find hope strength in each other to accomplish the impossible. Full of humour, compassion and hope, Angel Baby is a testament to the power of love and a roller-coaster journey to the magical fringes of the human psyche. There is a lot to like about and take in with this movie. The writer \/director Michael Rymer has bought a very interesting Australian movie to our screen. The story that we get here is one that is probably not all that uncommon, but is not known in our community. It accentuates the difficulties that people have when they are battling any mental illness and what rash choices they make when they are unable function mentally. This story also had the wonderful aspects that show Kate's obsessions of seeing messages from a TV game-show, while I am glad that the story shows both Kate and Harry choosing a life that they are probably not able to keep in complete control of because of their mental illness issues. Then as director, Rymer makes some very impressive moves. I love how the movie makes us as the audience feel like we are experiencing what the mental illness is like that both Kate and Harry actually have. I believe this mainly through the extraordinary camera work that is used, with all of its different views and angles. This aspect of the movie is helped by its cinematographer Ellery Ryan, who captures it all perfectly. I also love the choice of scenery used in 'Angel Baby', such as the shots of the city and the grand 'West gate bridge', which is used to great effect in the film. The leading cast to this movie was outstanding. Harry (John Lynch) and Kate (Jacqueline Mackenzie) are wonderful on screen together. They were both very convincing as both very mentally ill patients and it is through their performances that I believe this. There were some very real moments (well that is what they felt like for me) in this film where I believed these actors were suffering a mental illness for real. One such incident is when Kate is totally taken aback by being hit by kid skate-boarding at the local shopping centre. What I saw was a haunting sort of vision, one that I can relate to, and one that I was glad too see. The rest of the cast is pretty good as well. Harry has concerned friends, the Goodman's. Morris (Colin Friels) and Louise (Deborra-Lee Furness) both show at individual times that they are truly concerned with the situation they find Harry and his girl in. Their son, Sam Goodman, (Daniel Daperis) was another important character, who has a terrific scene with Harry, about being unable to sleep one. What Harry helps Sam out with is ironic, considering the situation that we see Harry gets himself into. I watched Angel Baby and 'Cosi', (another Australian movie, which deals with mental illness) back to back. Cosi was not as good as Angel Baby in my view, but the two films are completely different. One is from a totally serious point of view, while the other is coming from the comedic perspective about mental illness. I am still yet to see the classic Australian film 'Shine', starring Geoffrey Rush. But from what I have been told, it must be another worthwhile movie about how mental illness affects people, even brilliant and successful individuals. I am a firm believer that mental illness is an issue in society that is culturally misunderstood by most people. I believe this because people are either misinformed or misdiagnosed, or they immediately dismiss a person with such a problem, saying either 'they are making excuses for themselves' or 'they should just snap out of it'. I personally hate that point of view as it is not only arrogant, but it is also a very naïve point of view in my opinion. I say that compassion should be shown instead of criticism, while understanding and sensitivity should be learnt instead of straight dismissal and sheer arrogance. I guess my only criticism of Angel Baby is that it has a very limited cast, but perhaps that was a deliberate move, to show both Harry and Kate, for as long as they could. I would have preferred a bit bigger cast. I am glad that we were able to see all sorts of ideas, visions and images presented about how mental illness can affect people in 'Angel Baby', and are eternally grateful that an Australian movie is willing and daring enough to show it.

The Emperor, however, does not want to simply give Maximus away He wishes Maximus, not his own son Commodus, to rule Rome in his stead, for he sees that Commodus is unfit to rule. Maximus cannot decide just yet. But when Marcus Aurelius tells Commodus of his choice, Commodus kills his father out of depression, and perhaps failed ambition to rule. Claiming his father has passed, Commodus takes command then and there. Maximus, however, sees right through Commodus and intends to inform the Senate of the Emperor's slaying.

Maximus is clearly the best of them all, which is recognized by Emperor Commodus. He comes down into the arena to meet with the mysterious champion. Hesitantly, he removes his mask, states exactly who he is, and essentially calls Commodus out, but in a way only he would understand. Commodus' nephew, of his sister, idolizes Maximus, which leads to his mother meeting with Maximus.

Kubrick felt that so many of the absurdities of nuclear war (etc.) had to be left out in order to make the film a serious piece, but he also felt that they were necessary in order to get the full message across, so he decided to make the film a satire, unlike the book, which it is based off of. The result of this, is nothing short of extraordinary! Each character's name has sexual connotations and such. If one delves deeply enough into the matter, and begins to take notice, the entire film has a sexual underlining. From the first scene of the aerial re-fueling to the matter of precious bodily fluids with General Ripper to the ending idea of the underground society, primarily made up of men - sex is all around! Also at the center of the film is the idea of mutual assured destruction and the doomsday device - there is so much hidden between the layers of this film - its impossible to do it justice in a short comment. I urge everyone to take notice of every aspect of this film, from the differing camera shots and angles, to the dark humor, and of course, the message that lies underneath it all. For, in a Kubrick, only if one does this, can one achieve the full affect! =) Peter Sellers does an amazing job in his three roles. The immortal line You can't fight in here, this is the war room! shall live on forever in every film buff's mind. And of course, Dr. Strangelove being hardly able to maintain his hail Hitler arm - simply fabulous and extremely funny. The only fault might be in the fact that Kubrick cut out a final pie throwing scene which would tie up some loose ends (i.e. the Russian taking a secret picture of the large map on the screen) but Kubrick didn't like the final outcome, so he cut it from the movie. Still, this is movie magic and film at its best! Stanley Kubrick, master auteur, does it again.

Also at the center of the film is the idea of mutual assured destruction and the doomsday device - there is so much hidden between the layers of this film - its impossible to do it justice in a short comment. I urge everyone to take notice of every aspect of this film, from the differing camera shots and angles, to the dark humor, and of course, the message that lies underneath it all. For, in a Kubrick, only if one does this, can one achieve the full affect! =) Peter Sellers does an amazing job in his three roles. The immortal line You can't fight in here, this is the war room! shall live on forever in every film buff's mind.

The only fault might be in the fact that Kubrick cut out a final pie throwing scene which would tie up some loose ends (i.e. the Russian taking a secret picture of the large map on the screen) but Kubrick didn't like the final outcome, so he cut it from the movie. Still, this is movie magic and film at its best! Stanley Kubrick, master auteur, does it again.

Dr. Strangelove is simply revolutionary, witty, entertaining, funny as heck, and of course, with a powerful message underlying it all. Kubrick felt that so many of the absurdities of nuclear war (etc.) had to be left out in order to make the film a serious piece, but he also felt that they were necessary in order to get the full message across, so he decided to make the film a satire, unlike the book, which it is based off of.

Whatever weaknesses the film may have may be attributable to this aspect of its nature. What this film demands is an openness&#133; a willingness to embrace something new (at the time of its release); something different.Occasionally subtitled Life Out of Balance, Koyaanisqatsi is a cinematic montage of images set to a score by Philip Glass. There is no cast; no script; no dialog. Unfamiliar as I am with film history, I can only tentatively offer that this film may have pioneered (if not created) a new genre of film; a cinematic analog to the literary designation of creative nonfiction. Aside from its own sequels, I am aware of only two other films in this genre (one of which was also directed by this film's director, Godfrey Reggio).As to whether or not this film is good&#133; If forced to answer yes or no, I would have to say yes (and pretty confidently). Given the opportunity for a more nuanced discussion, however, I would wax philosophical on the premise that we all seek different things in theater; that some prefer movies which are deep while others prefer only to be entertained. That even those who prefer depth (solely or as part of widely inclusive tastes) may, nonetheless, have problems with this film and its siblings. There are no guarantees, and, regardless of your bent, you may not be open to taking risks with your ticket price. If, however, you like depth, are open to a different form of cinematic communication, and are willing to risk a few bucks, then I wholeheartedly recommend Koyaanisqatsi (and the sequels).Having disclaimed myself nearly out of the game, I will now defend and (to the extent possible\/necessary) explain what I know of this film.There is always a question about what makes for good art (and yes, I consider these films to be Art). Some seek stimulation of one sort or another; some merely insist that it be beautiful; others that it provide an intellectual challenge. There are many other schools of thought, including one which holds that, if you need to study and\/or explain a film, then it's not worth the effort. For me, all three films (to varying degrees; I have my own preferences), are resounding successes, in that they not only include the aforementioned virtues, but do so in such a way as to transcend a mere summing of the parts. Again, this is my reaction we're talking about, and, while I feel strongly, I allow that others may hold contrasting views.If the film's format is not immediately familiar, there is nothing so jarringly foreign as to effect prolonged disorientation in the average viewer's mind. Once you get into it, you really ought to be able to appreciate the beauty inherent in this film. If you process the media with which you are flooded (by whatever holistic means you may have at your disposal) you will find yourself mesmerized and soothed, while, at the same time, being challenged and possibly rent from your comfortable (if precarious) preconceptions about (what else?) the meaning of life.Some of these images will gently haunt you for years. If the themes seem well-worn or even hackneyed, consider that this was not so much the case in 1983, and that subsequent treatments of this material may owe quite a bit to this work. It is unfortunate that the current arbiters of such weighty considerations seem to be, largely, radio talk show hosts, as they rarely present earnestly held beliefs, and even more rarely do so with anything remotely approximating a sublime or transcendent sensitivity.Some would suggest that Philip Glass' brand of minimalism can be cold or sterile, which is lamentable, in my opinion, as it excludes so many possible manifestations of what constitutes acceptable beauty. Furthermore, his score is wholly appropriate to the film, in that it simultaneously provides a contrast for the lush images, while supporting and augmenting their already formidable intrinsic power.If I am to give in to cynicism, I might suggest that the film may be too serious for the modern viewer raised on the easily categorized, formulaic product of Hollywood and other movie-as-big-business epicenters. That is casts a critical and, perhaps, disapproving eye on aspects of Western Civilization, may also be a bit of a turn-off for some. Nonetheless, if you care about such things as the nature of existence or your place in the world, then you owe it to yourself to feast on these sounds and images. Besides having pioneered a genre, this is an important film which provides a perspective not adequately serviced by straight documentaries or cryptic allegories.
