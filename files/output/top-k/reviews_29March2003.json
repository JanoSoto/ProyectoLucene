[{"date":"29 March 2003","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Shrek is every bit as good as the classic Disney animation films (or at least many of them). Of course, animation has improved over the decades, Shrek being filmed using the new 3-D CGI. But animation is not what made the Disney classics great movies. It was the stories, the characters and the music. The full sweep of drama, comedy, and adventure that was available to live action, except with animation. These movies are for adults as much as for kids. Shrek is also in this class, although the story might seem a little thin and pedestrian. And the moral of the story, well it's been updated a bit to accommodate 21st century tastes. Nonetheless I recommend this movie for adults and kids alike.
