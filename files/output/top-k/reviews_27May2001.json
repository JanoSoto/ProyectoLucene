It can be appreciated not only by the young'ns for its storybook qualities and dazzling animation, but grown-ups too for its sophisticated commentary on how adults apply ridiculous fairy tale notions when seeking out love.

Like so many people I ran the gammot of emotions with this movie; very excited about its release and then very skeptical after the awful reviews it received even before opening night. Going on Saturday my expectations were low and by that time I do not think it was going to take much for those expectations to be if not passed then at least met. Upon further reflection, however, I realized how good this movie could have been and how much of a disgrace it ended up being. The only reason to see this movie on the big screen is the 40 minute battle scene that actually depicts the attack on Pearl Harbor(remember the movie is over 3 hrs long) The effects are breathtaking and the depiction of this horror is actually very well done. Unfortunately that is about all that is done well. Now, leaving the film what disturbed me the most was the end. I will not give anything away but EVERYTHING after the attack on Pearl Harbor is tedious, predictable, and sometimes down right laughable. Alec Baldwin, who supposedly steals the movie according to some critcs, is amazingly bad for such a small role. His lines are all cliched to the max and his mannerism's'are prototypical old-school army man. Affleck is ok and gets the most out of a bad script, delivering some not so funny lines in a funny way and not so poignant lines with surprising feeling. Voight as FDR is great and Akroyd, though not in it much, is a pleasure to watch. Besides that the rest of the acting is extremely poor. Hartnett gives an amazingly un-emotional performance and even though the script gave few chances for any character development Hartnett, for a supposedly budding star and heart-throb, is overshadowed by anyone on screen with him. Blanchet, as the love torn nurse, is only watchable during the battle scene when she does a good job of mixing the horror of the moment with the need to stay calm to help injured service men. Though gorgeous onscreen, and she has the look of an old style movie star in this film, Blanchet does not convince the audience of any true emotion during the film. FYI Michael Bay, if you have casted an actress who cannot cry when asked to, use age old methods to draw out the tears. Too many times, in moments when Blanchets character should be distraught, she remains dry eyed, while pretending to sob.As I said, at first the major problem I had with this flick was the ending, which is about as bad an endig as you can get, and I do mean the entire hour of film after the attack. After having a day to think about it however, I realized what a disgrace this movie was and how Bay and Bruck used a horrible moment in American history to make an overly-hyped, big booming action flick that will make money. Granted nothing may ever reach the accuracy of Saving Private Ryan or even Platoon, yet this movie really makes no attempt to relate the seriousness of the moment. This was Armageddon and The Rock, with the same effects, the same one or two men can take on an army concept, and an emphasis on horribly cliched moments and phrases. This movie could have been a wondeful depiction of that terrible day in 1941, could have brought the horrors of war, and espacially naval and air combat, home, and could have still done most of this while including a less time consuming, non-sensical love triangle.  You may say, why do we need the horrors of war brought home once again, whats the matter with a more light-hearted movie. You may have a point, but when dealing with REAL events it seems to me that the people who died must be honored, and honoring them means getting what ACTUALLY happened right. The fact that Bay and Bruck made little attempt to get all the details right is horrible. At least Titanic, another movie I am not in love with, made a good attempt to get history right and in the end focused the movie away from the Leo, Kate love fest and on he carnage that ensued. This movie fails not only as a product, that is a run of the mill movie, but also fails horribly as a cinematic repesentation of history. Veterans, who were honored, and righfully so, by the power of Ryan should be insulted by the almost insignificant role there horrible day plays in this film. Only 40 minutes devoted to Pearl Harbor in a movie named Pearl Harbor(that runs 3 hours)? An almost anxious jump away from the action back to the love-story? This not only fails as a movie, at least a $150 million movie, but also insults what many of our grandfathers and even grandmothers went through.

Well, maybe not mostly, but certainly I wouldn't have been as impressed if the crime movies of the past 10 or so years haven't been so derivative. Even Pulp itself is derivative of Scorsese's films, plus several other influences. The Yards, instead, is a very introspective film which I would compare very favorably to The Godfather. In fact, if its scope had been larger, it may have been up there in the same area as The Godfather. Instead, it decided to be a small indie, and what it does, it does spectacularly and perfectly.SPOILERSThe film begins as Leo, played by Mark Wahlberg, has just been released from prison. He had spent several years there on a grand theft auto charge. He desperately needs a job so that he can support himself and his mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is ailing from heart troubles. Who better to get a job from than your relatives? His mother's sister (Faye Dunaway) is married to Frank, a very wealthy man (James Caan) who runs a place that fixes and makes cars for trains and subways. Alas, this side of the family has grown apart from Leo and his mother. His Uncle Frank is willing to help him financially and give him a run-of-the-mill job after he has completed a two year technical degree. Leo has no time for this, and instead tries to get his way into the same company via his best friend, Willie (Joaquin Phoenix), who is romancing his cousin, Erica (Chalize Theron). That job would not necessarily require any sort of education, but is rather more on the business end of the company.But Leo soon finds out that this new job is involved in very illegal activities, including bribery and sabotage. While on a sabotage mission, things go awry. In order to avoid being caught and subsequently being sent to prison having violated his parole, Leo attacks a police officer. Worse yet, Willie is forced to murder a railroad worker after their arrangement goes sour. As Leo, Willie, and their cohorts flee, the police officer remains alive, although in a coma. The only way to get out of this is if Leo, who was really at fault for allowing himself to get caught, kills the cop before he awakes from his coma. As he is about to do it, Leo is forced to give up on killing the cop and, alternately, to flee from the violence of those who at first were his friends and now can do nothing but scrap him.From there, events spin out of control. Leo is, of course, being an ex-con, accused of both assault and murder. The situation becomes sticky for everyone. Every result is logical and intelligent. And amazing surprises pop up all the time. The story is compelling and elicits great sympathy.And even if the story does not impress you, and I don't understand how it couldn't, you simply must be impressed by the level of acting that is carried out here. The cast is populated mainly by three old masters and three young up-and-comers. Each of the six principles gives one of their greatest performance. Of the established actors, Ellen Burstyn has a small part, but she is every bit as good here as she was in her Oscar-nominated performance from Requiem for a Dream. Faye Dunaway has a very small part, but it easily surpasses anything that I've seen her in in about the last two decades. James Caan contributes a lot of supporting performances nowadays, and his Frank is an excellent character. He is not content to play just the shrewd businessman, but works a keen balance between that and a man who knows that those who are potentially dangerous to him are also his kin. Of the youngsters, each of the three have captured a reputation in the past several years. Starting with Charlize Theron, she has almost done too much, not exacting a very good sense of judgement in her roles. She has thus appeared in bombs (Reindeer Games, anyone?) and well-received films (such as The Cider House Rules, which I personally did not care much for). She has great potential, and she shows that best here, easily the best performance in which I have seen her. Joaquin Phoenix, just in this past year, has built up a reputation that is going to take a lot to live up to. He has give three masterful performances in the past year. His role in Gladiator was that film's saving grace, I thought. He was nominated for an Oscar for it, and, although no one was predicting a win for him, I was rooting for him. And then there was his role in Quills, one of the years very best films. He held equal footing with Geoffrey Rush, Kate Blanchett, and Michael Caine. That role was also Oscar-worthy. Now here he is with The Yards, and he is also great. His role, as with every role in this film, is very complex. The last scene he appeared in brought me to tears. Here we come to Mark Wahlberg. He has acted in a lot of crap, and in all of that crap he has brought in some dignity. Alongside that crap he acted in several great films. His two greatest highlights were Boogie Nights, which instantly established his career, and Three Kings. The Yards is up there with those two, and perhaps he is even better here than in those. In fact, the performance is very challenging, for it is not developed through dialogue so much as through expressions and body language. And, where the main characters of most films are intelligent, even philosophic men, Leo is unintelligent. His decisions are often very simple-minded, such as when he decides not to run when a siren is set off because he feels he must wait for Willie, even as his cohorts are bolting. This characteristic is established right at the outset, when Leo misunderstands that he was required to check in with his parole officer right away before leaving prison. Audiences so often object to a story where they are smarter (or believe they would be smarter in identical situations) than the protagonist onscreen. I remember after seeing A Simple Plan with a friend, he said, upon being asked what he thought of the film, I hate watching movies about mongoloids. They were so stupid, it was just irritating. But c'est la vie. People can be dense, and, as far as I'm concerned, a crime movie is much more interesting when the characters are liable to screw up during the proceedings. Leo has made some stupid mistakes, but now his only prerogatives are to take care of his mother and live like a normal human being.And as for the mood of the film, it is spectacular. It is reminiscent of The Godfather, but it is also all its own. The palette is earth-tones, dirty brown buildings and crummy apartments, filthy New York city streets. Every once in a while, a momentary brown-out occurs. Often, a character will use it to his advantage. More often, though, it establishes mood. The pace is slow, which makes the few bursts of violence all the more meaningful. The music is sombre. The only person who smiles in the entire film is Ellen Burstyn, for she is utterly happy that her only child is finally home. The other characters are quite sad in their lives. They do not prefer to live in a world of corruption. It is only that the system of corruption has been in place for so long that it cannot be expelled. When Leo delivers a speech at the film's close is delivered for the purpose of euthanasia. He wants to sever the entire system like a gangrenous leg. It is a truly powerful speech.

I generally have a preconceived notion of what a movie is going to be about before I go and I am rarely wrong. I had decided I wanted to see this movie the first time I saw a trailer for it many months ago. It looked like a well-done epic and I wasn't disappointed, even though I grew weary of the more than usual hype that preceded it. I was hoping to have a ticket price worth of entertainment, not a soul enriching experience of nirvanic proportions, as some viewers seem to expect based on other comments I've read. Get over it people, it's a film. The criteria should be, Does it entertain 'me'. Well, this movie far surpassed my deliberately lowered expectations.I think I have seen every action and effects movie ever made, having been a fan of such entertainment since the 1950's. I own copies of everything worth watching more than once. I went into this movie hoping it wouldn't be as much of a disappointment as Saving Private Ryan. It was far far better. The improvement to me was the much-increased plausibility of the character's stories. While Ryan was a contrived and twisted premise from a single bare thread of a real example, this movie was rich with the examples from many real life people and very real events. For example, it has surprised every young person I have talked with for them to learn there really were two young pilots who tore to a remote airfield and flew alone into the sky to challenge the collective assemblage of the Japanese naval air forces during the attack (so little real history is taught in schools now days) and I am still rankled to know the one instigator as portrayed by Affleck was denied the Medal of Honor because of his commander's mean spirited rejection because he had not been ordered into the air (a very real life travesty to fail to recognize amazing courage). How's that for a missed story line?I can also easily forgive the filmmakers in trying to present many stories in the form of the two main characters, Affleck and Hartnett, to tell a broader story of America. It saved time in trying to get the audience to buy into them emotionally. Sure some of the film wasn't historically accurate, so what, it's supposed to entertainment first and foremost. No historically based film I have ever seen has been completely accurate and those that have come close to that kind of reality have been roundly criticized for lacking action, as laughable as that irony is. Sure, an excellent film could have been made in two hours of footage, but instead we are treated with a lot more visually rich entertainment for our money - a real bargain. I also got the unmistakable impression that this was an attempt at much more than just a film about the attack on Pearl. It was an hommage to America's efforts in the war - all of America.The love story was actually an extra bit of realism many people are enjoying. It may have been added to attract more female viewers, but so what, aren't they deserving of some consideration by Hollywood too? I cannot begin to count the number of people of my father's generation whom I have heard while I was growing up tell how they met and fell in love during the incredible turmoil of that war. This is the telling of another story in it's own right, of the love and loss of the American women who endured it on the home front. The dull heartache of that kind of empty fear was the reality of their war as they loved and waited for their men to return home - if they did. Sure, a magnificent war story could have been told without the love interest entirely, but it would have been a different movie and far less of a moneymaker, so it may never have been made (this is called economic reality). The truth is one must attract a broader audience to turn a profit these days. I can say I was very surprised to see quite a number of unaccompanied females in the audience - almost unheard of for an action movie. Two teenage girls who came alone sat next to me in the theater and they were absolutely transfixed by the action and moved by the romance. I have NEVER seen another war film attract young female moviegoers this way. There were dozens of them in the theater.This is one of the few films to ever impress me with it's combat special effects. Not the newness or originality of them, or of raising the gee-whiz level of what Hollywood could do (who really cares about that anyway except overactive immature males), but the accomplishment of something far more difficult; stunning realism. To achieve realism, sometimes, less is more. I worked within the Department of Defense for over 31 years. I saw and participated in 4 wars in the military and as a civilian. This film is the closest to the actual experience of the reality of combat I have seen to date, including the vaunted Ryan, which was more of a presentation of the grit realism of war. Some detractions I have read clearly weren't paying attention or perhaps the closest they've been to this kind of real war is whichever film they last saw. This film achieved the mechanical realism of the machinery of war. It also contained, hands down, the best aerial combat photography I have ever seen (though much was special effects). The feel of reality was almost startling. Not all of it was completely real as it still disappointingly had some of the usual overdone Hollywood pyrotechnic explosions with tons of gasoline to awe the naive audience, but the most real thus far. Add together sequences from this film, Ryan and a few very chosen sequences from the Thin Red Line and you have quite a stunning collection. I can't include the Viet Nam era war epics as they are too close to home; all of those attempts miss the mark with far too much overdone Hollywoodistic pyrotechnic depictions of action.I really enjoyed the performances in this film. All of the younger cast members gave me my money's worth, but I felt Affleck did quite an exceptional job with the heavy task he was given to make such an over-the-top character believable - he was. Beckinsale's character was absolutely charming and I could easily see several young men fighting over such a beautiful actress. She did a very good job with the American accent too. Cuba Gooding's character seemed almost gratuitous and difficult to dovetail into an already packed story line but I'm glad he was there as he always gives a great performance and he certainly didn't disappoint me in this outing. Also surprisingly entertaining was James King as Betty. She really came across well on the big screen and I'd like to see more of her in the future. I was suitably impressed by Voight as Roosevelt and by Baldwin as Doolittle. Likewise, Mako as Yamamoto and Colm Feore as Kimmel were a valued addition, worthy of praise for their craft. They were fun to watch work. All gave great praise to the historical character's they portrayed with an integrity of realism not easily achievable. The overall quality of the rest of the cast was near impeccable with the only character I felt obviously underutilized being Tom Sizemore. I'd like to see him in more films with meatier roles. I also realize this film was already getting long - approaching The Longest Day in its scope and the length of its cast. Come to think of it, with a little more work and with Disney coughing up some more bucks this could have surpassed even that epic in actual run-time. It sure outdoes it in quality of product. I am going to supremely disappointed if this does not get an Oscar for effects and cinematography. The camera work was a real joy to watch with the only exception being the strangely blurry-lens effects thrown in the hospital scenes when it was under attack.Finally, in these types of films I always wonder how they are able to find enough Japanese actors to fill the cast. But those actors used here were quite excellent and gave heroic dignity to a very difficult task - to portray their historical countrymen without raising concerns of racism and engendering new nationalistic rancor against the Japanese. I would have liked to have seen more of Mako or Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa who played Genda, but I guess that film was Tora Tora Tora, which should be seen for historic comparison.

I can't include the Viet Nam era war epics as they are too close to home; all of those attempts miss the mark with far too much overdone Hollywoodistic pyrotechnic depictions of action.I really enjoyed the performances in this film. All of the younger cast members gave me my money's worth, but I felt Affleck did quite an exceptional job with the heavy task he was given to make such an over-the-top character believable - he was. Beckinsale's character was absolutely charming and I could easily see several young men fighting over such a beautiful actress. She did a very good job with the American accent too. Cuba Gooding's character seemed almost gratuitous and difficult to dovetail into an already packed story line but I'm glad he was there as he always gives a great performance and he certainly didn't disappoint me in this outing. Also surprisingly entertaining was James King as Betty. She really came across well on the big screen and I'd like to see more of her in the future. I was suitably impressed by Voight as Roosevelt and by Baldwin as Doolittle. Likewise, Mako as Yamamoto and Colm Feore as Kimmel were a valued addition, worthy of praise for their craft. They were fun to watch work. All gave great praise to the historical character's they portrayed with an integrity of realism not easily achievable. The overall quality of the rest of the cast was near impeccable with the only character I felt obviously underutilized being Tom Sizemore. I'd like to see him in more films with meatier roles. I also realize this film was already getting long - approaching The Longest Day in its scope and the length of its cast. Come to think of it, with a little more work and with Disney coughing up some more bucks this could have surpassed even that epic in actual run-time. It sure outdoes it in quality of product. I am going to supremely disappointed if this does not get an Oscar for effects and cinematography. The camera work was a real joy to watch with the only exception being the strangely blurry-lens effects thrown in the hospital scenes when it was under attack.Finally, in these types of films I always wonder how they are able to find enough Japanese actors to fill the cast. But those actors used here were quite excellent and gave heroic dignity to a very difficult task - to portray their historical countrymen without raising concerns of racism and engendering new nationalistic rancor against the Japanese. I would have liked to have seen more of Mako or Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa who played Genda, but I guess that film was Tora Tora Tora, which should be seen for historic comparison.

I generally have a preconceived notion of what a movie is going to be about before I go and I am rarely wrong. I had decided I wanted to see this movie the first time I saw a trailer for it many months ago. It looked like a well-done epic and I wasn't disappointed, even though I grew weary of the more than usual hype that preceded it. I was hoping to have a ticket price worth of entertainment, not a soul enriching experience of nirvanic proportions, as some viewers seem to expect based on other comments I've read. Get over it people, it's a film. The criteria should be, Does it entertain 'me'. Well, this movie far surpassed my deliberately lowered expectations.I think I have seen every action and effects movie ever made, having been a fan of such entertainment since the 1950's. I own copies of everything worth watching more than once. I went into this movie hoping it wouldn't be as much of a disappointment as Saving Private Ryan. It was far far better. The improvement to me was the much-increased plausibility of the character's stories. While Ryan was a contrived and twisted premise from a single bare thread of a real example, this movie was rich with the examples from many real life people and very real events. For example, it has surprised every young person I have talked with for them to learn there really were two young pilots who tore to a remote airfield and flew alone into the sky to challenge the collective assemblage of the Japanese naval air forces during the attack (so little real history is taught in schools now days) and I am still rankled to know the one instigator as portrayed by Affleck was denied the Medal of Honor because of his commander's mean spirited rejection because he had not been ordered into the air (a very real life travesty to fail to recognize amazing courage). How's that for a missed story line?I can also easily forgive the filmmakers in trying to present many stories in the form of the two main characters, Affleck and Hartnett, to tell a broader story of America. It saved time in trying to get the audience to buy into them emotionally. Sure some of the film wasn't historically accurate, so what, it's supposed to entertainment first and foremost. No historically based film I have ever seen has been completely accurate and those that have come close to that kind of reality have been roundly criticized for lacking action, as laughable as that irony is. Sure, an excellent film could have been made in two hours of footage, but instead we are treated with a lot more visually rich entertainment for our money - a real bargain. I also got the unmistakable impression that this was an attempt at much more than just a film about the attack on Pearl. It was an hommage to America's efforts in the war - all of America.The love story was actually an extra bit of realism many people are enjoying. It may have been added to attract more female viewers, but so what, aren't they deserving of some consideration by Hollywood too? I cannot begin to count the number of people of my father's generation whom I have heard while I was growing up tell how they met and fell in love during the incredible turmoil of that war. This is the telling of another story in it's own right, of the love and loss of the American women who endured it on the home front. The dull heartache of that kind of empty fear was the reality of their war as they loved and waited for their men to return home - if they did. Sure, a magnificent war story could have been told without the love interest entirely, but it would have been a different movie and far less of a moneymaker, so it may never have been made (this is called economic reality). The truth is one must attract a broader audience to turn a profit these days. I can say I was very surprised to see quite a number of unaccompanied females in the audience - almost unheard of for an action movie. Two teenage girls who came alone sat next to me in the theater and they were absolutely transfixed by the action and moved by the romance. I have NEVER seen another war film attract young female moviegoers this way. There were dozens of them in the theater.This is one of the few films to ever impress me with it's combat special effects. Not the newness or originality of them, or of raising the gee-whiz level of what Hollywood could do (who really cares about that anyway except overactive immature males), but the accomplishment of something far more difficult; stunning realism. To achieve realism, sometimes, less is more. I worked within the Department of Defense for over 31 years. I saw and participated in 4 wars in the military and as a civilian. This film is the closest to the actual experience of the reality of combat I have seen to date, including the vaunted Ryan, which was more of a presentation of the grit realism of war. Some detractions I have read clearly weren't paying attention or perhaps the closest they've been to this kind of real war is whichever film they last saw. This film achieved the mechanical realism of the machinery of war. It also contained, hands down, the best aerial combat photography I have ever seen (though much was special effects). The feel of reality was almost startling. Not all of it was completely real as it still disappointingly had some of the usual overdone Hollywood pyrotechnic explosions with tons of gasoline to awe the naive audience, but the most real thus far. Add together sequences from this film, Ryan and a few very chosen sequences from the Thin Red Line and you have quite a stunning collection.

The story itself wasn't very solid, but then again I didn't plop down my five bucks to see a story, I wanted to see what every red-blooded American did...non-stop action and carnage courtesy of Disney's generous $145 million budget. The action scenes were everything I'd hoped for and more. You're not going to see much better elsewhere. I loved everything about the attack, especially the intense, edge-of-your-seat moments leading up to the attack. The raid on Tokyo was also very well-done and very intense, but not as nerve-wracking as the attack on Pearl Harbor itself. Getting back to the story, let's see, it's your typical cliched love triangle between two best friends and the woman of their dreams...boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy goes off to war, boy shot down, presumed dead, boy's best friend breaks sad news to girl, boy's best friend and girl fall for one another, boy comes back, heartbroken. The story borrows heavily from every war movie that preceeded it, but in all fairness which war movie doesn't? The only cliche that really bugged me was the I'm not gonna make it, am I Sarge? scene in the end. That scene right there was almost enough to make me forget about the awesome attack scene.This film is not without its merits. It supports some top-notch acting. The entire cast is nearly perfect, delivering believable characters. Ben Affleck has never been better (okay, maybe he has, but so what!)...Josh Hartnett really shines in this one, maybe this will be the one to finally make him (which is long overdue, don't believe me, check out The Virgin Suicides)...Kate Beckinsale was superb (and extremely hot!)...Cuba Gooding Jr. was alright, he overacted a little bit too much for my taste...Jon Voight's portrayal of FDR was brilliant...Alec Baldwin really outdid himself...Ewen Bremner (Spud from Trainspotting) surprised the hell out of me with his authentic American accent...Tom Sizemore was great as always...Dan Akroyd was criminally underused...the list goes on and on. Kudos to whomever cast this film, they really did a great job and found some truly brilliant and unappreciated talent.This film is poised to become the next big thing. It may even go so far as to break Titanic's record. This film is so big that it will either make or break every one involved. Sadly, if this film bombs, we will be forced to watch several brilliant actor's careers go down the drain and the fall of the Bruckheimer empire. If this film succeeds, we will see Hollywood continue to wallow in its own excess, watch in horror as budgets go into the hundreds of millions, as ticket prices raise higher and higher, and the continuation of the Bruckheimer empire.

It is a character study. Very little action,of even the most basic kind. But you are drawn into the film, if you have even the slightest compassion, by the sheer loneliness and alienation of the characters.The lead character, Vincent, is a middle aged man, weighing 250lbs. Heavy.Our first introduction to Vincent plays upon our own bigoted perceptions of big guys that they're all perverts. But through the film, we get to know Vince, and find that he is motivated, or rather paralyzed, by a fear of change and a painful shyness. His also a highly moral person. Not in the Christian sense, which would tend to make him seem truly perverse, but in the Human sense. He believes in Dignity and, despite the seemingly futility of it, Hope. These are hard things to find in the small town in which he resides; especially considering he works in the family pub. I won't give away the ending, but HOPE sums it up.The film deals with the hardships of being an overweight man, without indicting anyone or blaming anyone; and without telling the audience that being a big boy is inherently evil. In fact, Director James Mangold has much affection for this lonely man. If you have ANY opportunity to watch this film on DVD with Mangold's commentary, please do, but only after you have watched the film once or twice.Pruitt Taylor Vince is perhaps in this film better than I have ever seen him. He is a beautiful man, whose eyes are filled with every emotion imaginable. I can tell, he has been through these painful experiences before in his own life.The rest of the cast is great too. You won't see glamorous people here. Shelly Winters plays the mother with a spareness that makes you think there's not much underneath, but as the film unfolds you find the exact opposite. Deborah Harry essentially revisits the Wise Guy character she played, but without the glamor. Lost and desperate, and too old to pretend she's not.Liv Tyler, in one of her first roles, is also lost and desperate, but without the cynicism of Harry. Great counterbalance. She is also beautiful, and compassionate.Mangold knows human nature. Here, he takes the brave step of challenging the audience to stop and think about it. The pauses in this movie are amazing, and say more than 30 minutes of a traditional narrative film do. This film is not just about a heavy guy...it is about all of us; how we react to those who are different, our own insecurities, our own sorrows, loneliness, and frail hearts.

So I waited the months and the months until about a week before it came out, and I was reading some horrendous reviews from some of the finest critics out there. The one that made me go and see this movie was from Harry Knowles, who I usually tend to agree with about movies. So I went in expecting a fine film, and came out having seen a movie that is just about as bad a movie as you can get(with maybe the exception of Batman and Robin, or The Mummy Returns). The whole love story is wholly unoriginal and extrememly uninspired. Throughout the whole movie you just know what's going to happen next between Danny, Rafe, and Evelyn. I had the ending of the movie figured out almost right after the Pearl Harbor attack, which, for my money, is the highlight of the movie(the only highlight, by the way). The movie was WAAAAY too long(I got up to go to the bathroom twice, and didn't care at all that I missed some of the movie). Probably the finest performance of the movie was given by Leland Orser(the killer from the Bone Collector), the man that Evelyn saves in the hospital. John Schwartzmann's cinematography is excellent, as usual, as is Hans Zimmers score. I'm truly sad that the movie turned out the way that it did, because it had so many things going for it--an incredibly cinematic event, good actors(they're not great actors by any standard), a very cinematic director who COULD be great if he had the right script and the right producer, and a very accomplished composer. Unfortunately, it also has a VERY weak script from Randall Wallace, writer of Braveheart(who is blatantly ripping off James Cameron's Titanic here in almost every respect), terrible acting from almost all sides, and again it's length--and I usually love a 3-hour movie. But not here. This movie should have ended after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, but it couldn't do that--the studio heads have to sell this movie to the teenage girls who wouldn't know if this was historically accurate or not(it wasn't, for the most part). It makes me truly sad that this movie is going to be a huge moneymaker--I doubt if it will be the next Titanic, but it might make about 300 million or so. In closing, I'll just say that the only reason I would go to see this movie, or even recommend it, is the bombing sequence(or the first 25 minutes, at least). It is sad when a films visual effects are its finest accomplishment, but that is the sad fact here. God help the future of american cinema.

So I waited the months and the months until about a week before it came out, and I was reading some horrendous reviews from some of the finest critics out there. The one that made me go and see this movie was from Harry Knowles, who I usually tend to agree with about movies. So I went in expecting a fine film, and came out having seen a movie that is just about as bad a movie as you can get(with maybe the exception of Batman and Robin, or The Mummy Returns). The whole love story is wholly unoriginal and extrememly uninspired. Throughout the whole movie you just know what's going to happen next between Danny, Rafe, and Evelyn. I had the ending of the movie figured out almost right after the Pearl Harbor attack, which, for my money, is the highlight of the movie(the only highlight, by the way). The movie was WAAAAY too long(I got up to go to the bathroom twice, and didn't care at all that I missed some of the movie). Probably the finest performance of the movie was given by Leland Orser(the killer from the Bone Collector), the man that Evelyn saves in the hospital. John Schwartzmann's cinematography is excellent, as usual, as is Hans Zimmers score. I'm truly sad that the movie turned out the way that it did, because it had so many things going for it--an incredibly cinematic event, good actors(they're not great actors by any standard), a very cinematic director who COULD be great if he had the right script and the right producer, and a very accomplished composer. Unfortunately, it also has a VERY weak script from Randall Wallace, writer of Braveheart(who is blatantly ripping off James Cameron's Titanic here in almost every respect), terrible acting from almost all sides, and again it's length--and I usually love a 3-hour movie. But not here. This movie should have ended after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, but it couldn't do that--the studio heads have to sell this movie to the teenage girls who wouldn't know if this was historically accurate or not(it wasn't, for the most part). It makes me truly sad that this movie is going to be a huge moneymaker--I doubt if it will be the next Titanic, but it might make about 300 million or so. In closing, I'll just say that the only reason I would go to see this movie, or even recommend it, is the bombing sequence(or the first 25 minutes, at least).

Other than that, this movie doesn't have many high points. I loved the trailer (Going to a lot of movies, I must have seen it 7 times), the music from The Thin Red Line fit perfectly. The trailer made it look like it was a grand epic, with a little love story to make romantics happy.Sadly, this is not the case. The first hour and 15 minutes (or so) of the film focuses mostly on the love story, and what will later become a love triangle. It is predictable, sappy, and overdone, not in an enjoyable way (as it was in You've Got Mail), but in a manner that becomes tiring all too quickly. At times you almost wish the Japanese would hurry up and bomb the place all ready, just so we can leave the pathetic attempt at romance alone.Then there's the music. If you want a good movie, you must have good music. If you saw the trailer, you know what I mean by good music. Music that stirs the soul, the moves you just by hearing it. This was not the music we had for Pearl Harbor. I will confess now than I've never been a huge Zimmer fan, but I do believe when the time calls for it he can do well. I wasn't expecting much, but even I was disappointed by his score. One point which stands out to me was when Affleck was chasing a bomber after the bombing, while music played in a background which would of fit better in a Saturday morning action cartoon than this movie. The score was uninspired, and the great theme, which was Zimmer's excuse for rushing the rest of the music, wasn't all that profound.Another problem the film has is a contradiction between the script and the title. You would suppose the main characters would have us involved quite a bit with the events of Pearl Harbor. Sadly, the filmmakers are more concerned with telling their love story then what happened on the Infamous Day. The main characters get so off track, that another character (Cuba Gooding Jr.) has to be inserted into the story for no other reason than to have a point of view on Battleship Row during the bombing. The main characters are away from the action for the first half of the attack, and when they do enter they are not even involved in the major areas Pearl Harbor is known for. I have heard some comparisons between this film and Titanic. Though they both had love stories, Titanic was just as focused on the sinking of the ship as it was on its fictional tale of love. Pearl Harbor seems to be a love story which is interrupted by a bombing.I may be a fool, but I somewhat judge a movie by its trailer. This can be misleading, especially with comedies, but usually dramatic films give you a good idea of the story in the trailer.

It's full of inside jokes that mostly comic book fanatics and fanboys will get. All this is to be expected from Kevin Smith, whose debut movie Clerks is becoming the stuff of Hollywood legend and gets a little better every time you see it. This time, though, Smith tries something new with his knack for writing emotion. Ben Affleck plays Holden, who, along with his good friend Banky (who is played by Jason Lee and, with a name like Banky, is understandably miffed at the world), have created the cult hit comic Bluntman and Chronic, about two familiar-looking pothead superheroes. Holden is introduced to another comic writer named Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams), and the two hit it off immediately. He has big plans for a relationship with Alyssa until he discovers Alyssa is a lesbian and tries to break off connections with her. He finds he can't stay away, though. He's sure it's true love, and pursues a friendship with her, much to the dismay of Banky, who is mad at losing his friend and, the movie suggests, might just be attracted to Holden himself after all these years. I don't want to spoil too much of it, and many of the twists and turns are great, but the whole idea of a lesbian getting cured by finding the right man is a ridiculous stereotype. The movie addresses this unlikely occurrance, but that can't help the fact that the major hinge of the plot is senseless.Some more things that gripe me about this movie 1)Parts of JLA's performance. She's a great flirty actress, but that voice! The scene outside the ice rink is enough to make your ears bleed. 2) Jay and Silent Bob are only in the movie for one scene! It's a great scene with a great setup, of course, but I would've liked it a lot more if, at the end, Silent Bob shows up and demands getting paid for the use of his parable in the title of a comic. 3) Smith, while very gifted in writing, is terrible as a visual director. The camera either jerks around or just sits there like it's dead. And 4)The ending. No, besides Bob not showing up. There is a scene where (SPOILER!!!!! SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER!!!!!) Holden decides to address the rivalry between Banky and Alyssa over Holden's affections. He explains that after much thought, the best way to solve it is.... for all three to have sex with each other. It sounds like a joke on paper, and at first it sounds like a joke in the movie, but you quickly see that they (Holden in the movie, Smith in the script) are quite serious about it. The scene would fail horribly if it wasn't played out and acted the way it was; total sincerity from all three actors. The scene works so well that you're surprised to find that you want it to happen; it seems it would resolve everything so well. But, unfortunately, we're met with a cold turkey ending that is really kind of depressing. I guess the ending we're given is more realistic, but, at the risk of sounding perverted, I think all three of them making love together would've been very emotionally sound, and actually kinda touching.Other than that, it's a very smart and well made movie. Acting and writing are what will make you want to see it again. It's not as funny as Clerks, nor as thoughtful as Dogma, but afterwards you're still left thinking about yourself and your... dare I say it?...standards.

It sounds like a joke on paper, and at first it sounds like a joke in the movie, but you quickly see that they (Holden in the movie, Smith in the script) are quite serious about it. The scene would fail horribly if it wasn't played out and acted the way it was; total sincerity from all three actors. The scene works so well that you're surprised to find that you want it to happen; it seems it would resolve everything so well. But, unfortunately, we're met with a cold turkey ending that is really kind of depressing. I guess the ending we're given is more realistic, but, at the risk of sounding perverted, I think all three of them making love together would've been very emotionally sound, and actually kinda touching.Other than that, it's a very smart and well made movie. Acting and writing are what will make you want to see it again. It's not as funny as Clerks, nor as thoughtful as Dogma, but afterwards you're still left thinking about yourself and your... dare I say it?...standards.

The usual clever conversations about well-known pop culture like Star Wars and Archie are great, the usual chat about everyday life, love and porn rings true, and of course, Jay and Silent Bob are awesome. It's full of inside jokes that mostly comic book fanatics and fanboys will get. All this is to be expected from Kevin Smith, whose debut movie Clerks is becoming the stuff of Hollywood legend and gets a little better every time you see it. This time, though, Smith tries something new with his knack for writing emotion. Ben Affleck plays Holden, who, along with his good friend Banky (who is played by Jason Lee and, with a name like Banky, is understandably miffed at the world), have created the cult hit comic Bluntman and Chronic, about two familiar-looking pothead superheroes. Holden is introduced to another comic writer named Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams), and the two hit it off immediately. He has big plans for a relationship with Alyssa until he discovers Alyssa is a lesbian and tries to break off connections with her. He finds he can't stay away, though. He's sure it's true love, and pursues a friendship with her, much to the dismay of Banky, who is mad at losing his friend and, the movie suggests, might just be attracted to Holden himself after all these years. I don't want to spoil too much of it, and many of the twists and turns are great, but the whole idea of a lesbian getting cured by finding the right man is a ridiculous stereotype. The movie addresses this unlikely occurrance, but that can't help the fact that the major hinge of the plot is senseless.Some more things that gripe me about this movie 1)Parts of JLA's performance. She's a great flirty actress, but that voice! The scene outside the ice rink is enough to make your ears bleed. 2) Jay and Silent Bob are only in the movie for one scene! It's a great scene with a great setup, of course, but I would've liked it a lot more if, at the end, Silent Bob shows up and demands getting paid for the use of his parable in the title of a comic. 3) Smith, while very gifted in writing, is terrible as a visual director. The camera either jerks around or just sits there like it's dead. And 4)The ending. No, besides Bob not showing up. There is a scene where (SPOILER!!!!! SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER!!!!!) Holden decides to address the rivalry between Banky and Alyssa over Holden's affections. He explains that after much thought, the best way to solve it is.... for all three to have sex with each other.
