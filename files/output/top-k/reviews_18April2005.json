I was drinking a lot of Heineken with some friends at this girl's house...she had a boyfriend&#151;who was working at the time&#151;and I had the hots for her. She insisted we watch Donnie Darko, a movie she loved. I'd heard of it, but never had a chance to see it, as it played in theaters for about twenty minutes.So the first time I saw it, I didn't get it. I enjoyed the writing (How exactly does one suck a f***?), the performances&#151;Jake Gyllenhaal mixes creepiness and coolness effectively, creating a thoroughly believable, somewhat disturbed dude-&#151;and writer\/director Richard Kelly's visuals, the centerpiece of which is obviously Donnie's new imaginary pal, the six-foot rabbit named Frank, (with a head that looks like Rob Zombie's idea of the Easter Bunny). Now, the DVD Director's Cut has restored about twenty minutes of footage. Now, I couldn't exactly tell you which scenes were cut originally, but I do know that certain gaps in the first version have been patched up...as well as they could, since like most sci-fi\/fantasy phantasmagorias, it runs on its own version of logic.The film opens with Donnie sprawled on the side of the road as the sun comes up. It's a weird opening; he looks like a car hit him. But Donnie just...likes to do strange things. His WASP-ish parents have sent him to a psychiatrist&#151;he burnt down an empty house, he tells the new girl, Gretchen, (Jena Malone), can't drive until I'm 21, that sort of thing. His parents are played by Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell, and they're two of my favorite characters in the movie. His dad, Eddie, seems like he's been in the suburbs so long he's not even jaded...Donnie's stunts, like telling an empty-headed teacher to stick a ridiculous assignment up her ass, simply make him laugh. And Mary McDonnell is a great actress...Donnie's mom is a genuinely good lady, and tries (only half-heartedly) to be the disciplinarian I don't think telling any woman to forcibly insert an object up her anus is something that should go without consequence, she tells her husband. I think we should buy him a moped, he says. I think we should get a divorce, his wife says, and they both start laughing.At the outset, Frank the giant bunny rabbit tells to Donnie to follow him out of his house, and gives him a countdown in 28 days, the world with end. Donnie smiles, Gyllenhaal's wicked little grin reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's in The Shining. He wakes up on a golf course and when he gets home, discovers a jet engine has somehow smashed through his house, landing in his room, right on his bed. Had his imaginary friend not lured him out, he'd have been flattened.In the days that follow, he woos the new girl, Gretchen, enrages the braindead teacher who is enamored of a shallow, Brylcreemed self-help guru (portrayed by, improbably enough, Patrick Swayze), and Frank makes him...do things. Drew Barrymore and Noah Wylie have small parts as married teachers at Middlesex (brilliant name), the private school that is sort of bane of Donnie's existence while at the same time providing him with the opportunities to display to everyone around him just how full of s*** they all are. (You know what you say to people like that? his dad tells him at one point, F*** You!) At one point, Wylie (who seems to only take movie roles wherein he plays a somewhat distant, cold bastard...he must know he's good at it) shakes his head as he grades papers and says to Barrymore, Donnie Darko... and they just smile knowingly.I might not have been QUITE as quietly whacked as Donnie when I was in high school, but I'm pretty sure I inspired a few lively teacher's lounge discussions. I like Donnie Darko the character a little more than the movie itself, because he's as weird as I am. The difference is, he's the middle child, and I'm the oldest. (Jake's older sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Donnie's older sister Elizabeth, and Donnie has a little sister, Samantha, who's part of a little girl dance troupe, Sparkle Motion) In fact, I think the most interesting part of the movie isn't the time traveling, paradoxical weirdness but Donnie's case-study as one of the most extreme cases of Middle Child Syndrome ever.Still, the Director's Cut goes a long way to actually explaining how Donnie can see long, gelatinous tendrils growing out of people's chests, leading them to their destiny (they look like the water-alien's in The Abyss, actually)...and if you haven't seen it, well get going and check it out, because it takes a lot of time to explain. Still, when I see it, I'm always reminded of a certain girl...and while at first, I thought the ending was a little blah and contrived, I feel differently now...now, I think it takes the movie into a different realm, one where we might ask ourselves what we might sacrifice for someone we loved.

I felt the movie was a little slow, especially in the second half, and it could have been about 20 minutes shorter.

Let me break it down for ya The good Kevin Kline... oh, Kevin Kline, he plays this part so naturally, and he definitely holds the entire movie together (which is needed, as it has a lot of loose ends). In fact, I could watch the movie again just to see his performance. Every word he says (even if it is a contrived revelation about living life to the fullest or something like that, which is the writer's fault, not his) oozes with humanity, and the scene in which he destroys his models after being fired will go down as one of my favorite scenes of all time...that's right... all time. Watch this movie for Kevin.Scott Thomas excellent actress, plays the part well, you struggle along with her during the emotional roller-coaster (sorry for that cringe-inducing cliché, and the one I just used to describe it). Her and Kline make quite the on-screen pair.The metaphor The house... it's SO obvious and in your face but I love it anyway. Tearing it down (as well as a lot of tearing down\/coping with family history that is explored well in the movie, especially in an unbelievable scene between Kline and Christensen that ends beautifully like this... Build this house with me.) Incredible.The not so good Christensen I know, I know, everyone and their dog praises him in this role...I just don't see it. Whiny to the point of nausea...not in that playing the character well way but in a, well, nauseating way. He is saved by Kline in most scenes. Nothing much to see. And his character changes so quickly and unnaturally, which leads me into...The writing The first 75 minutes of the movie are, for the most part, so beautifully written... witty, touching, bloody emotional. The rest is filler (in my opinion). All issues are resolved easily and predictably. And the ending... I mean come on, why? In my head I pretend it was never there,it makes the movie better in hindsight, which, if I may quote the movie, is like foresight without a future. Yeah, that was in the first 75 minutes.I DO recommend this movie.

It's a spoof film about movies that desperately need to be spoofed, which should have led to a much better movie. That's why the first Austin Powers was so good (the other two sucked, as you all know), because the James Bond films so badly needed to be spoofed. Unfortunately, there was not enough emphasis on making fun of teen movies as there was on making another one. Yes, the movie makes fun of all the standard teen movie clichés, but only enough to give it an excuse for having them all. Just like in Jeepers Creepers where the sister tells her brother as he crawls down the mysterious hole on the freaky guy's property, This is the part of horror movies where someone does something incredibly stupid and the whole audience hates him for it! Needless to say, he crawls in anyway, and presumably the scriptwriters sit back and grin contentedly, another day's work done. Sadly, as is the case in Not Another Teen Movie, the direct admission of stupidity is neither an excuse nor the justification for it. That being said, the movie is at least entertaining in the way that all spoofs, even the really bad ones, are, you get a test of your movie knowledge by how many of the movies being spoofed you can name along the way. I have no interest in listing them, as I am sure you have no interest in reading a list of the movies I recognized. Most of them are stupid movies anyway. I have to say I enjoyed the scene at the end where Molly Ringwald showed up, for the same reason I liked the scene at Preston's party where the black guy from Save the Last Dance appeared. As Stephen King pointed out in Bag of Bones, people love seeing characters that they recognize from other stories make appearances in new ones. It's almost like seeing family again. Stephen King does this more than any other author I've ever read, and if you're going to make a movie making fun of a whole genre, it's certainly a good idea to get a couple of the major stars from that genre to come in and make fun of themselves. But sadly, other than that the movie is an almost complete waste. Even Jamie Pressly, who is hardly known for her respectable and powerful performances, is completely wasted here, forced to do such ridiculous scenes (ridiculous even for a teen movie spoof) like the cheer recruiting scene in which she talks about how she's the cheer captain and so she makes all the cheer-cisions and how she's all cheer-cited about getting a new cheergirl since they're one short and are in something of a cheer-mergency. It is certainly telling about the rest of the movie that this is meant to be funny. But like the rest of the movie, Not Another Teen Movie is an exercise in making fun of teen movies in ways that are generally so bad or so tasteless or simply so unamusing that they make you feel more uncomfortable than anything else. Oh, and how's this for a telling little factoid, the funniest scenes in the whole movie are the ones in which the main character cries. Go figure.

On this particular day in the movie, Ferris decides he is taking the day off. After all, How can anyone be expected to handle school on a day like this? Ferris calls his best friend, Cameron Frye (a young Alan Ruck), who is always sick, and tells him to pick him up. After all, Ferris does not have a car. He wants to show Cameron a good time before High School is all over and wants him to have something good to remember about it. Also, Cameron is Ferris's phony caller voice. Whenever Ferris needs a call made, such as from a police officer or another parent, Cameron is the man.Eventually, Ferris and Cameron gets Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) excused, by using the dead grandmother excuse. Ferris is always one step ahead of his adversary, Principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones). Rooney is portrayed as a hard ass principal who does not let anything get by him. He sets off to catch Beuller in the act and put a permanent mark in his record and hold him back another year, so as not to have other Ferris Beuller wannabes for years after Ferris's departure. Jones was perfect for his role as Rooney and I do not think that role will ever be surpassed for him.Most of the movie is spent with Rooney looking for Ferris and, as mentioned earlier, is about one or two steps behind him.

Ferris will say something like, If we played by the rules right now, we'd be in gym class and then it cuts to an exaggerated look at a gym class, which more resembles a boot camp. Ben Stein will forever be remembered here as the extremely boring economics teacher.There are many more characters to this movie that make it great.

Gene Kelly puts in an unforgettable performance as the all-singing, all-dancing, Don Lockwood.The story follows a group of Hollywood filmmakers, making the transition from the silent movies of yester-year into the new age of talking-film. With a little help from his friends Lockwood turns a terrible formulaic studio picture into a show stopping musical.This is one of those films that everyone should go back to and watch again. It is a fantastic reminder of how the musical genre used to be, and should be! It also struck me as surprisingly historical, charting the introduction of the talking-movies and the initial public and professional reaction to it. Watching this film will remind you of the heart-warming, lifting feeling that many modern films just fail to deliver. If anyone can resist the urge to smile and laugh during Donald O'Connor's fantastic performance of 'Make 'em laugh' then it would be a very sorry day indeed! If it is an achievement to get your audience on the edge of their seat then this film surpasses that achievement because I was very close to dancing on mine!!!

It is a fantastic reminder of how the musical genre used to be, and should be!
