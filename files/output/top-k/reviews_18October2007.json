You either absolutely love it or absolutely hate it. However, it is my favourite movie ever and here are my reasons why - ** CONTAINS SPOILERS ** 1) It is 3 hours long. What many believe to be its biggest fault is I believe its biggest strength. It takes its time to develop a story. You live with these characters. You enter their world and experiences. In the age of fast editing, 30 second attention span, car chase, explosion entertainment, it is refreshing to have a film that gives the audience time between lines and scenes to absorb the story. We all have such hectic lives, it actually is essential to take time out and watch films such as these.2) Thomas Newman delivers his best soundtrack ever (and he has created some classic and innovative ones - American Beauty, Shawshank Redemption, etc). The Newman family's contribution to movie music is immense but this sits at the top of that very prestigious combined body of work. The main Joe Black theme manages to be both haunting, yearning, melancholic and hopeful at the same time. The final 10 minutes is just sublime. As near perfect an arrangement of music you will ever find in cinema. Then, the credits roll to the beautiful segue of Somewhere Over The Rainbow\/What a Wonderful World by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole. The juxtaposition of the triumphant celebratory orchestra crescendo to such a naked track is just phenomenal. If you add to that Whisper of a Thrill, Someone Else and Mr Bad News, this is genius music that will last forever.3) It has so many poignant moments a) Cold Lamb Sandwiches &#x96; loss and grief accompanied by melancholy pianob) But I not lonely herec) 65 years...don't they go by in a blink. Yep they do, so make the most of each day. Joe Black could visit you tomorrow.d) It's hard to let go isn't it. Yes it is Bill. Well that's life what can I tell you. You don't get dialogue like that in Gone in 60 seconds!e) Should I be afraid?...Not a man like you.4) In Anthony Hopkins - we have the finest actor of his generation, if not ever, (and I am big fans of De Niro, Pacino, Newman, Hoffman and Hackman too), who can convey the power of the big corporate media mogul, the doting father, the not-so-doting father, fear and shock, anger, comedy, wistful mourning. Not his best performance in a movie (Remains of The Day is still his best work) but a close second (and yes Hannibal Lector is a movie icon and that was class too). It takes a subtlety and deft of hand to bring these many facets of one character into a believable performance.5) Brad Pitt is consistently voted the most fancied bloke in the world and that is such a hindrance for an actor. But in this movie he does pull off one of his best performances. He both menacing and vulnerable at the same time. Believable child-like naivety, yet all knowledgeable. He's often underrated because of his looks but in this film he co-stars with the best and he holds his own well.6) Jeffrey Tambor7) Clare Forlani - must have been overwhelmed to have been cast opposite two of cinema's biggest icons but she does make the journey from cynical world weary doctor to smitten love struck woman believable. Her best scene is actually when she realises who Joe is and manages to convey a whole gamut of emotions without any dialogue.8) Jake Weber (suitably slimy) and Marcia Gay Harden (suitably neurotic) &#x96; have small roles that add flavour, back story and substance to the main characters.9) Death and Taxes. A satisfying twist at the end explaining who Joe Black is, without revealing his true nature.All in all, this film tell a story, in its own time. It has a great company of actors led by the best in the business. A story of a death without being morbid. A tale about appreciating things, loving your family, wanting the best for your children and not fearing death - its gonna happen anyway you cant change that but you can affect how you get there.Yes it has flaws, what film doesn't. The final scene when Brad isn't death anymore - always makes me think why doesn't Susan say Hold on a minute, you are the bloke I fell for in the caf√© but not the bloke I just kissed. But you can do that in movies - you are after all watching light being transmitted at 24fps - you have already suspended your disbelief to be told a story - it isn't a documentary its a supernatural tale (Even and especially Shakespeare makes you believe in the fantastic). So I excuse that because the soundtrack is awesome while they are doing that scene.Not everyone will relate to the lavish lifestyle portrayed in the film - helicopters, mansions, butlers, but that isn't the point! Of course if Death wants to experience the best in life, he's not gonna choose the life of a vagrant or a bedsit in Hackney. This film is not a social commentary.It is sentimental, but then that's not such a bad thing. I take a lot of things from it about life, love and it doesn't hurt to be reminded that we are all mortal and to gain a perspective about your life as a whole.All that is good about movies is contained in this film and I urge you take time out to watch this film with the most important people in your life, absorb the story, feel the emotions of the characters and most importantly buy the soundtrack!

That's too bad, because this is in its own right a superb movie, which, for the most part, offers what appears to be (from my admittedly imperfect knowledge of the historical event of the sinking of the Titanic) a faithful recreation of what happened on that memorable night.Whereas the '97 version added a fictional romance between a somewhat implausible couple in order to recount the story through their eyes, this movie sticks quite to the point. We seem to get to the iceberg fairly quickly, and the movie does a good job of showing the gradually (very gradually, actually) rising tension and ultimately panic on the ship. While some may not have liked the addition of the romance in Titanic I think it might have given the '97 movie somewhat more of an ability to draw the viewer into the story by giving them characters to really get to know and to care about, and I have to confess that - while I think both movies are tremendous - Titanic did make a bit more of an impact on me for some reason.The performances in this movie were excellent, though and this did come across as a team effort by the cast. No one really stood out as the star. You couldn't identify one actor (or one character) and say this is who the movie was about. Some of the performances were worth noting, however. Laurence Naismith as the Captain was excellent, as was Michael Goodliffe as Mr. Andrews, the ship's designer. Both know almost from the first moment that the ship is going to sink, and both are portrayed as calm and professional in going about their duties - the way I would like to believe they would have been. Tucker McGuire gives her own take on Molly Brown, and is quite good in the role. I also appreciated the focus on the Carpathia and the desperate attempt by its captain (Anthony Bushell) to get to the scene of the disaster as fast as possible, as well as the Californian, which was closer but ignored the sinking.The only real flaw here couldn't be helped given that the movie was made in 1958. James Cameron had the advantage of computer simulations and, of course, the fact that the wreck has been found. He knew the boat split in half before it went down. In this movie, the Titanic goes under in one piece. But they wouldn't have had any way of knowing that, I suppose, although one wonders why the survivors - from whose accounts the original book by Walter Lord (which I read when I was in high school) and then this movie are supposed to have been made - didn't mention it.In any event, one has to recommend this movie to anyone truly interested in the historical event.

A lifelong resident of the area, it was Dudley's childhood dream to become a Mountie. He lives in a small cabin with only his horse, Horse, as a companion. Yet, two people from Dudley's past resurface in the small, nearby village. One is Nell (Sara Jessica Parker) who Dudley has loved since their tweenage years. She has returned from a trip around the world and is more lovely than ever. But, alas, the other returnee is the dastardly Snidely Whiplash (Alfred Molina). He was Dudley's rival for Nell's affections long ago, despite his evil and conniving ways. Soon, Snidely has taken over the town's businesses, by hook and by crook, and is making a big play for Nell's attention while Dudley manages to upset the ruling party in Ottawa and is fired from his post. The world is looking pretty harsh to Dudley, that is for certain. Will he recover his job and win the heart of Nell? This is a second, cartoon-based film for Fraser, after the infinitely more successful George of the Jungle. The same creative minds were at work here but the results are far from perfect. Don't blame the cast, however, for Fraser, Parker, and Molina, with a bit of help from Eric Idle and Alex Rocco, are the reasons to see the film at all. Simply put, they are terrific and rise above the mundane script and uneven direction. Certainly, there are some very funny scenes, such as the one in which Snidely orders a poor lady and her children out of their home or where Dudley has the bad luck to have a moose head fall on him during a critical moment with Nell. Now, that's entertainment. Unfortunately, though, a few good scenes do not a great film make. Yet, if you like silly nonsense with likable stars, you might take a chance with this film.

Now, that's entertainment. Unfortunately, though, a few good scenes do not a great film make. Yet, if you like silly nonsense with likable stars, you might take a chance with this film. Yes, it may elicit a yawn here or there, but it's truly not a bad way to spend a couple of leisure hours.

A lot of people seem to think it's exploitation or propaganda; personally, I consider it more of an elaborate fantasy than either of those things, though you do have to wonder if the young screenwriter Harmony Korine is some sort of Holden Caulfield type who absolutely hated his peers. The main storytelling problem is that neither Clark nor Korine gives the slightest explanation for why these kids are the way they are, an obvious requirement if this is going to be taken seriously, but as I said, I will not pass judgment, because this might be the greatest monster movie of the 90s. I will explain more in a second.First, I have to give the movie objective praise for being entertaining in a strictly visual sense. Bright sunlight combines with big, wet, refreshing splashes of color in the outdoor scenes, and at all times the screen is filled with bustling crowds and movement to the point where it becomes overwhelming. I can see where some people might find this annoying, but it does an equal job of creating a sense of heat and agitation that Spike Lee was praised for in Do the Right Thing, and, for me at least, it's fun to watch. (Note that my comments here are only extended to the color scheme other elements that make a good movie, such as pacing, sound quality, etc., generally suck.) So, photographically speaking, it's already enjoyable, but the enjoyment is cranked TO THE MAX with the character of Telly. Now we get to the movie monster thing I was talking about, because Telly is definitely not human except in the strictest of taxonomic terms. Scene one establishes him as a lanky, freckled kid who looks like Alfalfa and talks in an extremely garbled, incomprehensible voice, like he has a mouthful of condoms, and also has somehow gotten a 13 year old girl to fall in love with him. Soon afterward we cut to a group of attractive girls in their mid-teens discussing the horrible sexual experiences they have all had with one guy, and I, the viewer, am taking this in quite passively until I realize they are talking about TELLY. WHOA--BACK UP FOR A SECOND. The same Telly we just saw!?!? I can buy him getting young and inexperienced girls, but hot 17 year olds!? From here on the movie turns into a supernatural thriller as we find out that Telly, who hilariously refers to himself as a f**k monster, has apparently seduced half the teenaged girls of Manhattan with almost no effort--the only explanation being that he has demonic mind control powers. The suspense builds as Jennie (Chloe Sevigny, whose performance is the best in the film) attempts to track down the f**k monster before he gives another 13 year old girl AIDS. The final shots, where she closes in on him, are edited together at increasing speed in the actual convention of monster movies.As an objective portrayal of modern youth, the movie may be accurate for a small part of the population such as Larry Clark and his friends (you can read about his early life in interviews), but normal people will be turned off by it unless they view it as I do an insane, surreal, vivid and captivating fantasy\/sci-fi thriller about the world's most unrealistic ladies man who must be stopped at all costs.

When there is a nasty or particularly gory scene in a film, audiences shuffle around or look away from the screen &#150; it evokes a physical reaction similarly when people laugh at a good comedy. This is enough evidence to suggest; at least to me, that Play Misty for Me works not only on this level as it got a physical reaction out of me without being too gory or too funny but also as a raw character study between two very different people.This was Clint Eastwood's directorial debut and he plays Dave, a disc jockey who does a relatively mellow and straight forward radio show from the hours round about midnight through till dawn or something. His voice is soft, almost flat and at one point he even has to replay a previous show over his shift that he only did a few nights ago but I don't think anybody would mind or even notice since the show is so laid back. The film is anything but and descends into a quite chilling yet at times quite brilliant thriller when Evelyn's (Walter) 'fondness' shall we say for Dave grows into an unquenchable thirst since you get the feeling that marrying Dave and spending every single second of your time with him on your own in a small room for the rest of your life STILL wouldn't be enough for the girl.Evelyn is dangerous and it's a danger that is cleverly built up over a period of time. The relationship starts off fairly customary, even harmless as they exchange dialogue and find time to discover that they both like their steaks cooked the same way but this is as close to innocent the relationship comes. Following numerous other things they have in common which at the time, you're thinking could just be coincidence, Evelyn breaks into numerous outbursts at people who don't really do anything wrong thus hinting at perhaps her true persona something so mild and insignificant can start her off into a fit of rage.The film plays out the classic tale of the stalker. There are a few references to modern day films you can make here; most notably The Cable Guy where Jim Carrey scared us and dared us to laugh at his actions as well as One Hour Photo where a family gets the stalker treatment from Robin Williams' creepy and very un-funny Sy Parrish. Evelyn challenges Andy Robinson's Scorpio as 'most psychotic bad guy in a 1971 Eastwood film' whilst at the same time being genuinely creepy and hiding her various personas in the process.What is really impressive about Play Misty for Me is the way it contains a sort of undercurrent revolving around one man's actions. Dave sleeps with Evelyn in a one night stand scenario and it comes back to not only haunt him but threatens his life throw a group of sharks a piece of meat and they'll get the scent for blood. Likewise, I actually thought that the film may have been slightly better had Dave and Evelyn not slept together thus making Evelyn look even more desperate for him.

When it first came out, this film was lambasted by almost everyone as way too long and boring as dirt. Having watched it twice now I feel that it has been the recipient of too many unfair assessments. Westerns are iconic to American movies and culture. Many American myths are manufactured and admired in the schemes of Westerns. What Camino found attractive in the Johnson County wars is a bit of a mystery in itself. An event best known to historians of the old West, Camino felt it needed a movie to honor the drama. OK, that's a bit odd but he did it anyway.Much like The Deer Hunter, Camino's film is a bit too long and certainly self absorbed. That being said, the plot is not hard to follow, the characters pretty standard bad guys, villains, victims, with two strong characters fighting over the same love interest. Pretty much the same western plots and subplots seen in countless movies. What makes this film work for me and motivates me to give it a high rating are its redeeming features. The visual images are simply so gorgeous that we are entertained visually throughout the film. The obsessive attention to details shows through very well and after all these years the visual recreation of those times is recreated in all its glory. This is a film that you have to be willing to view like it was a long opera; you simply cannot be impatient and expect a quick formulaic western to ride you off into the sunset. That would have been easy to accomplish and Camino opts for a larger scale dynamic. Sure, many scenes take up too much footage, that is a weakness in my view. But, what we see is very entertaining.The actors, not quite in their prime, all young and vibrant, give terrific performances. Especially outstanding are Kristofferson, Walken, Hurt, Waterston, Bridges and Huppert. I know, that's almost the whole cast, but they were really great to watch. This is a drama for adults and if given half the chance to tell a story on a canvas as big as Wyoming.....works for me. I like long films that are highly dramatic for example, Barry Lyndon, The Deer Hunter, Citizen Kane are examples of very good films that are also very long. I have come to the conclusion that Camino's vision was worth the effort to create. A very fine western that has rarely been eclipsed for beauty and attention to historical detail.

Arthur Miller's original story is one of power and the terrible nature of society on two fronts. First, it tackles the inner struggle of a morally strong man who's emotions get the better of him and the girl who will do anything to have him be her's forever. Secondly, it displays the flaws of the government and society in general, and how one person's claim can corrupt an entire town. It's a stunning take on the foolishness and utterly unbelievable nature of a topic that dates back to the Salem Witch Trials, McCarthyism and is even poignant today in terms of the War on Terror.The topic that interested me more was the first one I spoke of; a striking study of a moral man who's done a wrong and the pain he has to suffer because of it. John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a working man, who gets whatever he earns with his bare hands. His wife, Elizabeth (Joan Allen) is the standard working class wife. While John is in the field, she gets dinner ready and gets the house in order. Lingering over this seemingly perfect marriage is a secret that has isolated them from the rest of the community. John's affair with a former servant, Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) has created a cold, emotionless relationship between the two but Elizabeth's devoted love for him means that they will stay isolated and no one will ever know of his sin which would surely lead to his hanging. Of course no man can endure this experience without suffering some severe inner pain and this slowly unfolds over Proctor throughout the course of the film.In the end, after turmoil between John and Elizabeth both trying to do the best thing for each other that has turned into the worst case scenario for both, Proctor's pain is unleashed in one of the most heartbreaking scenes in as long as I can remember. He agrees to proclaiming his life in the world of witchcraft in exchange for releasement from prison back to his wife and unborn child. But when they ask for his signature on the statement, and state that they will post it on the church wall, his years of torment and internal frustration explode as he pleads in a scene of gut-wrenching release as he begs for the jurors to leave him his name. This story is all highlighted by an absolutely brilliant and cathartically heartbreaking performance from Daniel Day-Lewis. He even upstages the commanding Queen Joan Allen (who also delivers a superb performance) in several scenes, and delivers one of the finest examples of acting genius I've ever had the privilege of experiencing.This entire relationship and painful release is experienced under the grand scheme of the Salem Witch Trials, an eye-opening display of how easily the government and society can be fooled and won over. Due to her love for John Proctor, Abigail Williams will do anything to take Elizabeth out of the picture. Even if this means bringing down all of Salem in the process. She starts claiming that everyone is a witch, along with her numerous friends who so easily follow her example, in order to avoid getting into trouble. When she realizes how brilliantly this works, and how everyone she claimed practiced witchcraft ended up in the gallows, that she could use it to end Elizabeth and live a happy life alone with John. Of course the folly of youth is there blind belief that everything will work according to plan, and she underestimates Proctor's love and devotion to his wife who he clearly shows he will go to the grave with. Abigail see's that no matter what she does, she won't get John back and flees Salem in the midst of night, never to be seen again (at least as far as the film\/play is concerned). Winona's performance is also very strong and ranks high among the best of her career and of 1996.At the center of this entire story is how easy it is to sway society, shown through these Witch Trials. Arthur Miller originally wrote his play to comment on the foolishness of McCarthyism; the children representing McCarthy, the jurors obviously as the government and the false witches as the dozens of people that McCarthy accused of being a communist under no grounds that were put into prison for being completely innocent. These two incidents in American history show that the government lies down to the very core of their jural structure. The phrase 'Innocent until proved guilty' is one of the most abused in history and these historical accounts prove that we are and have always been much more about the reverse; guilty until proved innocent or, in terms of the Witch Trials, hanging unless you admit your guilt. Even now we see the flaws of the governmental structure as numerous people are being claimed to be terrorists and are put in prisons, though there is no concrete evidence of that which they are prosecuted for, just the false claims of a foolish society.

Mostly, because I was able to see the queen differences that time has taken on films. Compared to other older films I have seen, the actresses and actors don't seem as fake and script written. The four sisters show the true interactions that my sisters and I go through. This film was completed only six years after the first talkie was done. And for that, I believe that this films sound came out wonderful. It's a mono with a RCA sound system. For the music, it is blended with the voices of the actors well. There are a few times where there is only a song playing while the film becomes silent. The March sisters have a few screaming spells that seem to almost burst the speakers and become very raspy. But, overall the sound quality was great. The music in the set, such as the piano, and off the set, where cued in very well together. The date of this movie explains a few mishaps during the film. There are a few flickers through out the film, the alternation of light and dark caused by the opening and closing of the projector's shutter. Though they are small and almost unseen, they do exist. The frame shift is usually done by fading in and out of each other. The few times that one frame ends by showing a complete black screen, the next frame usually takes a while to show, which makes that frame seem very abrupt. The beginning of the films flashes that credits over a small cottage in the distance with the well done special effects of snow. The motion of the film is normal as you can see the movement of the characters as the camera viewed them during the shooting of the film. Camera movement if used seldom.

In the beginning of the film when Jo is trying to sneak out of her retched aunt's house, the camera is obviously rolled backwards away from Jo as she approaches the unseen door that you think is directly behind the camera. The camera does a few scenic swipes but nothing drastic. Since the film is older the camera shots aren't very creative and towards the end they become dull because you are tired of only being able to see the head on shot.

This film was done by Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corporation, RKO, founded in 1928, making this one of its first films.

Also, by having music come from the piano onset at the March's house, cued in my backstage instruments, or singing. The lighting always set the mood. When Jo was crying over her ill sister Beth in the upstairs attic like room, the only light seemed to appear from the moon light coming in through window, which gave a gloomy and sadden scene. Also, when the eldest sister was getting married everyone glow in white and there was no darkness. The morality of the movie reflected the hard times during the war which was over popular in all movies and novels during this time.

I could agree with some and disagree with still others for various reasons, but I felt that in the darkness was an effective reprieve of the good-guy characters that Bruce has been. So many other actors\/actresses, when crossing over from regular 'good' roles seemed to be not fully transferred into character as the 'antag'. Here is Willis as an almost silent killer that has no charm or swift dialog as quite a few of his past roles of the like have been for him, the success brought to him by that m.o. this one is simply a non-emotional 'black hole' of a man looking for revenge for something or someone that has happened to his life. A hole that he himself cannot even fill, so he continues to destroy, trying to reach a place that he will never make it to. Strange but true. Bruce Willis is the top! My biggest problem with this film that is equipped with a brilliant cast, has one main flaw...that being Richard Gere. Don't take me wrong here, which most will, there has been many roles that Gere has done that was right on the money from, 'An Officer and a gentleman'(1982) 'No mercy'(1986) Pretty Woman (1990) right on through The Mothman Prophecies (2002) Chicago (2002) Primal Fear, Red Corner, Final Analysis, First Knight, etc. To me he is not fit for this role or especially the accent itself, for me as I watched, he never quite pulled off all the way. He looks Italian for one thing and all the regular 'eye-blinking' blowing air out his nostrils-that is a trade mark of his, that he has done in some many other roles. It just didn't feel as though he owned it outright. The haircut I have to say, for Willis' character was a genuine real convincing look for him, being a cold-blooded hit-man, it was Stauglin-is-tic.Sydney Pointier was a soundly placed character, he played that man to perfection.Without Gere in that place, it could have been a ten but for me it rests at 7\/10.

Having seen it myself, I would say that this is one of Kubrick's best. The film deals with the topics of sex, trust, secrets, and temptation. Tom Cruise plays a doctor, married with a seven-year-old daughter in New York City. He takes his wonderful life for granted, until his wife admits to have almost cheated on him. Stunned by this piece of news, he is drawn into a dark world of temptation, whether it is with a prostitute, or with his patients' daughter. Finally, he is drawn to this mysterious mansion where an orgy of masked people satisfy their lust. In the discussion of art and filming, this movie is a masterpiece. The atmosphere is so mysterious, so dark, and very strange. There are some scenes that sent shivers down my spine. One thing I liked in particular was the conversations Tom Cruise's character had with characters such as the hotel clerk, the Russian store owner, and his old friend. One disappointment was Nicole Kidman. I just did not like her in this film, for a number of reasons. Her acting did not impress me as much as Tom's did. I was glad that much of the scenes were focused on Tom Cruise's character rather than Nicole's. She is probably the biggest reason that I would rate the film 9 out of 10 rather than 10 out of 10.However, it is a very good film overall. Stanley Kubrick died believing that he had made the best movie of his life with Eyes Wide Shut. I'd say he was not too far from the truth.

Having seen it myself, I would say that this is one of Kubrick's best. The film deals with the topics of sex, trust, secrets, and temptation. Tom Cruise plays a doctor, married with a seven-year-old daughter in New York City. He takes his wonderful life for granted, until his wife admits to have almost cheated on him. Stunned by this piece of news, he is drawn into a dark world of temptation, whether it is with a prostitute, or with his patients' daughter. Finally, he is drawn to this mysterious mansion where an orgy of masked people satisfy their lust. In the discussion of art and filming, this movie is a masterpiece. The atmosphere is so mysterious, so dark, and very strange. There are some scenes that sent shivers down my spine. One thing I liked in particular was the conversations Tom Cruise's character had with characters such as the hotel clerk, the Russian store owner, and his old friend.

To name some aspects, the cast was done perfectly. Jon Voight owned the role as hustler Joe Buck and there was no one more scuzzier for the role of Enrico Ratzo Rizzo than Dustin Hoffman. Another superb aspect was the sound mixing, with Harry Nilsson's rendition of Everybody's Talking' dispersed evenly throughout the opening sequences of the film. The transitions in the film were inventive and clever, directed by John Schlesinger. Midnight Cowboy is an emotional pitfall, leaving the viewer with few, if any, missed points. The missed happiness of the film was drown out by the moral and heartbreaking touch Midnight Cowboy depicts on screen. This film includes a deep complexity, which is unfortunately surpassed by other thoughts about the film (such as its pornographic nature, just as American Psycho, that dampens the genius of the film). Cowboy needs no introduction, nor does it need explanation- it's 1969's Cream of the Crop and clearly aspires not to be western-based material (1969 already had way too much of that from such releases as True Grit, The Wild Bunch and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid). Its media continues to captivate and elude audiences and when viewed correctly, it has powerful, moral standards appropriate for its time, appropriate for any time.

The man, Helge, is visited by his relatives, children, and friends, all of which respect him. That is, until one of his two sons, Christian, stands up at dinner and accuses Helge of some horrendous acts done in the past involving sexual abuse. Initially, the visitors ignore the outrageous claims, but things unfold as Christian continues to act against his father. Thus, the birthday celebration turns into a manifestation of the despicable relationship between Helge and his children. The final scene brings some surprise, not in a plot twist but in the way its played out. Overall, the story is involving and has many aspects that are easy to relate to for all audiences.There are some interesting technical aspects. The camera is largely hand-held, leading to much shaking and rocking and rolling. Although it added to the family atmosphere, it was distracting at times. The acting was well done, especially with the two brothers Christian and Michael. Ulrich Thomsen plays Christian, the son that appears to be mentally unstable until evidence is able to support his claims. Thomsen's acting style is effective and gives a strong impression of deep struggling. The character that really jumped out at me was the other brother, Michael, acted by Thomas Bo Larsen. Even though he is a simple-minded, ignorant, and rather mean character, its hard not to like him. Despite his negative traits, it becomes clear that he is an innocent but mislead individual. He often serves as comedic relief, but also has deeper significance in the events.Festen pulls the audience right in, mostly due to its compelling story and characters that are easy to relate to. The dark past of the family serves as an intriguing plot element that satisfies to create an unusual celebration. Recommended for everyone, but especially for people that love unconventional yet dense movies.
