Don't worry though, the differences are that remarkable that having seen the other does not give much of clues to the other.By now I declare to be one of those who consider that Dark City is better film than Matrix. Many have said that and actually I have not heard anyone to claim the opposite. Be warned though, this film is completely different beast than Matrix - different Matrix could ever be.I feel rather impressed currently. I have finished watching the film some half an hour ago. Time has passed just enough that I have watched the extra material the DVD disc provides.The name of the movie gives all it out. Dark City. It tells the feeling. It tells what you are going to see. Not murky or greenish depressive world like in Matrix, but utterly dark. You'll going to see something that has more pessimism in it than anything in Matrix. In that sense this movie could be compared to Delicatessen where world is dirty and cruel, but where Delicatessen only has the artistic touch, this movie has well hidden plot as well. I say well hidden, because you are not going to know exactly what is going on until in very end of the story. You would receive half truths all along. Where as Matrix gave out there about all the secrets in very early and the rest was action, the Dark City let you live it within the mystery not knowing how deep or far it goes.Word of warning for Matrix lovers. This is not an action movie by nature. At least not in the degree Matrix is. This film has a lot more action in it than films like The Seven for example, but the action is not that glorified like in Matrix. The action seams a lot more real. I mean the presenting of it, not the physical manovers. Well, where in Matrix the self was boostable, in the Dark City that is very limited. Don't expect ultra jumps or anything fancy, the 'tuning' is something else. The differences make sense to you when all secrets have been revealed. At that point you might wonder what you have been expecting. After all, this is not Matrix. This is artistic, dark, science fiction movie and far better than Matrix. This is such a movie that I don't regret a minute that I bought the last copy of it from the first shop where I saw it.

The release of George Lucas' seminal blockbuster 20 years ago was the kind of happening which affected a generation of movie-goers, and I include myself in that generation. I was 10 years old in 1977, and when you were 10 years old in 1977 you were not judged by whether you had seen STAR WARS; you were judged by how many _times_ you had seen STAR WARS. It awed us, it delighted us...and yes, hyperbolic though it might seem to say so, it changed us.As much as it changed the people who watched movies, however, it changed the people who made movies even more. Hollywood heads were sent spinning by the success of STAR WARS, a film with no stars, a simplistic story-line out of old Westerns and some nifty special effects. It was not long before studio executives realized that two fundamental lessons of STAR WARS could be translated to other films 1) If you made a special effects-laden adventure with a modicum of skill and dropped it into your summer release schedule, when young potential movie-goers had summer job money burning holes in their pockets, they would come and come again, story be damned; 2) One successful film could turn into one or two more, plus action figures, lunchboxes and T-shirts (the twin goddesses of Franchising and Merchandising). And thus STAR WARS begat the event film, which begat BATMAN, which begat TWISTER and INDEPENDENCE DAY. And they slew the medium-budget film, and there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth.You can't really blame Lucas for what has happened to American film-making, though, because there is no way he intended for crass commercial concerns to become so dominant. There is no way STAR WARS could have worked if he _had_ had such an intention. Lost in all the ink spilled with references to Joseph Campbell, back-brain mythopoetics and anti-technological humanism is the fact that STAR WARS was not a great movie. The most surprising thing a viewer might find in the SPECIAL EDITION has nothing to do with with the dozens of critters tossed into the backgrounds, but rather how restless he might get waiting through the first half. For nearly an hour, STAR WARS is characterized by the fussy quarrelsomeness of C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels), the intergalactic Leo Buscaglia sermonizing of Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and the laughably petulant plea by Luke (Mark Hamill) to go to Tashi Station and pick up some power converters. STAR WARS wasn't a great movie; it was, however, an extraordinary movie-going experience. You sat in a theater with a few hundred other people and for two hours you were utterly transported, because it was innocent in a way no film can ever be innocent again. You felt as though you were part of something joyous, a celebration of cinema as fantasy and a celebration of good triumphing over evil. In an era when you can see the veins bulging on big-budget action films as they strain to impress you, STAR WARS was effortless in its enchantment.That movie-going experience is what this re-release is all about. The difference between STAR WARS on the big screen and STAR WARS on the small screen is the difference between Mount Rushmore and a picture of Mount Rushmore, between Wagner on a cassette deck and Wagner played by a symphony orchestra. If there is an element of not-inconsequential element of nostalgia in the way crowds will flock to this re-release, that is understandable; many will be hoping to re-capture a youthful moment when they fell in love with movies for the first time. STAR WARS SPECIAL EDITION may end up disappointing those who come to it as though on a pilgrimage, but the dazzling editing of the climactic trench run will certainly remind anyone who has seen what passes for a spectacular in the last few years how exciting a science-fiction adventure film can be.There has been some consternation over the idea of Lucas fiddling with such a cherished film, but frankly, I don't understand all the fuss. This isn't a case of someone whose only connection with a film is ownership of its rights deciding to colorize it; this is a director's attempt to realize the vision he always had for his film, a fairly common practice in an era of Director's Cut video and laserdisc releases. Some of the new additions are merely window dressing, including Han Solo's (Harrison Ford) encounter with Jabba the Hutt; others, like a scene between Luke and his friend Biggs (Garrick Hagon) help set up later scenes more effectively. But if anything Lucas has done threatens someone's memories of a first experience of STAR WARS, I can only suggest that the experience couldn't have been terribly profound. In terms of the details, this is a different STAR WARS, but it is the spirit of this story which has moved people for twenty years.

Following this, we meet the young 'prodigy' of a cop (Stone), played by Andy Garcia, who says what, a total of 10 words throughout the duration of the movie?

A lot. So naturally, The Untouchables begin to feel his wrath. (Didn't see that one coming)First, let's start by killing the nerd. In order to do this, we must arrange it so that he is escorting an essential witness (and squealer) to the courthouse. Of course! That's perfectly logical. Then, to spice things up, throw in a glitch in security, thus allowing one of Capone's men to sneak into the police headquarters, dressed as a cop, and somehow manage to get appointed as the armed guard for Wally and his witness. Toss in a small service elevator, and you've got a double murder. Woohoo!Poor Elliot. Things are just not going his way. So the only thing to do is- you guessed it!-  go storming over to Al's hotel, confront him and his posse, and get in his face. Here we get to see his ghetto side. I really thought he was gonna say, `C'mon, bitch. You wanna piece of me?' and bounce his stomach off of Dinero's. Too bad he didn't. That would have made for some quality entertainment.

I lean forward, as do my classmates, in eager anticipation of things to come, my hopes high, my mind waiting to be enlightened. After all, my history professor wouldn't show a movie that was disastrously abominable, would he?HAH.Okay, the first scene begins with this oh-so-artistic overhead shot of Mr. Al Capone (Dinero) getting a shave and an interview by a bunch of nervously obedient reporters. This gives him the opportunity to introduce his character as a smooth talking tough guy. I'm trembling.Then we lead into another artistically shot scene where we see just how tough he really is. See, he makes stores (and little girls) go BOOM if they don't cooperate with him. I'm shaking.And this, of course leads into the sharply contrasting scene that portrays the idyllic life of Mr. Can-do-no-wrong, Elliot Ness. Aw, look, his sweet little wife is packing him a lunch. All we see of our hero at this point is the back of his head. So far so good.AND THEN...To the police station, where we first get a glimpse of our Good Guy.  And who do you think it is? That's right, none other than KEVIN COSTNER. Let me tell you, I almost threw up.(Let's just say my opinion of Mr. Costner is less than. complimentary)Okay, I says to myself. So the main character is played by Kevin Costner. Maybe the rest of the movie will make up for it.HAH.Alright, alright. The first half an hour, give or take a few minutes, was `Okay'. Not stellar or even worthwhile, but definitely tolerable. During this time, we are introduced to the sage old timer cop (Malone), played by Sean Connery.basically, a walking cliché. Following this, we meet the young 'prodigy' of a cop (Stone), played by Andy Garcia, who says what, a total of 10 words throughout the duration of the movie? And then, last but certainly not least, we throw in the nerdy accountant (Wallace), who somehow ends up with a gun and an attitude.of some sort. I never really figured that one out. Oh well, I must be stupid.Sometime during all this, we came to a scene where Elliot and his family were gathered in their living room, listening to the radio. I honestly got a kick out of this, and here's why They had a 1930's model Cathedral radio (Which my family happens to own), and they were listening to Amos and Andy (I'm a big old time radio buff, and own many of their shows). However.this little highlight fails to compensate for the rest of the film.The other memorable occurrence during this first portion of the film was the scene where, again, Mr. Capone is showing his deeply rooted nasty side. See, as soon as I saw him pull out the baseball bat (even though he was supposedly using it for an analogy) I put two and two together. See?  Bad guy + baseball bat = bad situation.  And guess what? I was right.Anyways. All of a sudden, we're at the 'Bridge Shootout' (in order to stop a shipment of booze), and our four Untouchables are now desperados (give me a break). on horses, no less. And here's where things really start to go downhill. Although, to be perfectly honest, I couldn't really pay attention during this scene. I was too busy cracking up. I mean, who are you trying to kid with that MUSIC?!. But what's most priceless about the whole thing is at the end, when poor Kevy (Elliot) actually has to kill someone.insert gasp here.

I think this is only natural when you're dealing with a film which extends it's reach in a few different directions.

This crowd is offended by what appears to be lack-luster action scenes and what would be considered slow, overly emotional narrative.  Considering the action was choreographed by Yuen Wo-Ping  (one of HK's most revered martial arts directors), I'm a bit confused by the first criticism.  I can only assume that there may be an issue with the cinematography of the action itself, which is given a less traditional treatment by Ang Lee (probably for the benefit of the Western audience) replete with slow-motion close-ups and unorthodox camera angles. I personally found this very refreshing, and felt it added some real drama to the fight scenes (especially the Zhang Ziyi\/Michelle Yeoh showdown in the compound).  As for the emotional timbre of the film, I can also understand how this may be less than palatable for a traditional HK crowd.

Even if you don't like the film, you have to realize that there are some great things about it, not the least of which is it's incredible originality.Is Dancer a musical?  Well, yes and no.  It's a musical in the sense that there are songs sung and danced by the cast in the middle of the movie.  But that's where the definition ends.  Lars von Trier (the director) and Bjork have opened the door, I think, for more expressive musicals to be made.  Selma (Bjork) is a simple daydreamer, and uses music and dance throughout her life (and the film) as a way to deal with reality.  She's not crazy, but very flighty.  This musical uses songs the best way they can be used in a musical  to explain characters actions and feelings rather than just having the actors just breaking their pattern of real dialogue and bursting into song.  This point is amusingly pointed out by Peter Stormare's character (Jeff).  When Bjork breaks out into song and dance, we know it's not really happening, and that it's her way of dealing with certain situations.Between the unusual songs and the way that the scenes in which the songs are used are written, Dancer shows us a lot of things we have never seen in a film, and it must be commended for that.  In particular, the pivitol scene (no spoilers) between Bill (David Morse) and Selma, and the final scene of the film.The characters are extremely well developed, in particular Selma, Bill and Jeff.  Bjork, Stormare and Morse allow us to read volumes into their characters just by their expressions and actions.  Stormare in particular, with very few actual spoken lines in the film, tells us all we need to know and more about his character.  He and Bjork should be strongly considered for Oscar noms.There was very little filler in this film.  Surprising for a 2 hour and 20 minute film that's relatively simple.  Every scene is crucial to our understanding of the characters;  there were no scenes that I thought were unnecessary.  Bravo to the editors.A lot of reviews have called the film blatantly manipulative.  I don't agree, but I can see why someone would say that.  But I actually think the manipulation is very sublte.  Sure bad things happen to Selma .  But they happen in the context of the mood of the film, and they're presented in a realistic fashion.  It's not like the film Bounce or any other film where an unrealistic tragedy happens to a wildly happy and self confident individual.  Dancer, I'm told, is shot with real lighting.  It definitely takes on a realistic style.  The mood of the film is somewhat down, so when bad things happen, they don't seem blatant or out of place.  And so what if you think the movie is being manipulative?  Are filmmakers not allowed to make sad, weepy stories?  Bjork is perfect for this role.  She doesn't overact at all, and her natural quirky look and behavior are perfect for Selma.  Obviously, we all know she can sing and dance.  But she should be able to make us forget that she's not an actor so we can lose ourselves in her character, and she does.  You're not sitting there thinking That's Bjork, the singer when she's in character, like you do in a Madonna movie.I really have no complaints with this film.

They would be like these guys, hard and tough, desperate and lost.  Maybe I just got caught up in the movie too much, but *** MINOR SPOILER ALERT ***even the grizzled group of bagmen that James Caan brings along to the climactic showdown was interesting to me.  I could just imagine the things they had to do to survive and succeed in the movie's world, and that's not an easy thing for a movie to do.  I would cheer if McQuarrie decided to make a movie JUST about Joe Sarno and Abner.  You just know that these two guys have seen and experienced a lot as they survived in the underworld.  I'm sure a lot of the credit for how effective these characters were should go to the actors, but I'm also sure that McQuarrie had his own mythology about the characters and communicated that to the actors.  But I digress.....*** End of MINOR SPOILER ALERT ***A few people disliked the abundance of twists and revelations in the movie (Roger Ebert pointed this out in his review), but I thought all of them were plausible, logical, and subtly foreshadowed.  In other words, I never thought the movie cheated just to include an interesting plot twist. I read somewhere that this was McQuarrie's f**k you to people who pigeonholed him as a crime film maker and forced him into making another crime-drama.  I have no idea whether it's remotely true or not, but it sort of makes sense because this is the logical end-of-the-road for those kinds of movies.  Y'know, the one's with the type of characters I described above.  Snatch was an excellent fun movie, but compare the Dick Tracy characters in that to the realistic fully-realized characters in this movie (I know, apples and oranges.  I know, Snatch is supposed to be like that.  I'm not knocking it, I'm just trying to make a point).  Even the characters in Usual Suspects seem a little flat compared to the ones in WOTG.  I certainly hope McQuarrie makes some more crime dramas in the future, after he's had the chance to make other kinds of movies to give himself a break from the same ol' same ol'.

Although the running time is a tad excessive (could've been a tight 1h45m movie, I'm sure), there are enough moments where you just go Wow, that was pretty amazing\/cool to more than adequately keep you interested.  Also, multiple viewings will allow you to see what's really going on between the lines.  Scenes that seemed forced and awkward on the first viewing make more sense and are totally fitting with the characters once you get to know them.  In other words, it's a strange request but don't judge the movie until you've seen it at least twice.  Unfortunately this means that people who weren't interested in this movie to begin with will most certainly dismiss it as a little too this or a little too that.  I was like that after my first viewing too, but I sat through it one more time as my friend was watching it and was really impressed.  I think I screwed myself up the first time by having expectations or, more accurately, assumptions about the movie and my brain just couldn't switch gears to adapt to what was being presented to me onscreen.  Maybe you won't have that problem and you'll be able to enjoy it right from the start.  Whatver.The best thing about the movie is the characters.  Every single character is fully developed and, most importantly, interesting.  Mr. Longbaugh and Mr. Parker are not hip, ironic icons of cool, like a lot of Pulp Fiction knock-offs.  And aren't we all tired of those already?  Instead they are what I'd expect would happen to these Pulp Fiction knock-off characters if they were put into the real world.  They would not be cool.  They would not have everything under control.  They would not be likable criminals that swagger around getting involved in illegal hijinks.  They would be like these guys, hard and tough, desperate and lost.

The performances from Ford and Pfeiffer are solid, even above their norm in spots... but the thin, predictable plot, unnecessary red herrings and overly long running time make their efforts seem as labored as the characters they play, trying to escape from the submerged truck cab in the final scenes. Still, I wanted to like the film... it tries to be spooky and succeeds in that area best with good use of atmosphere, silences and small disturbances in the house. Adding a bit of horror, we get some nice touches with reflections of images, misty fog and ghostly messages (electronic and handwritten), But ultimately this is not a horror movie. When it moves into the suspense mode, the film is less effective. There are elements of suspense and some suspenseful moments, but they rarely add up to more than Boo! or Gotcha!, as in typical fashion a character moves warily about the house, looking around the corners with an appropriately frightened expression and finally  gets the jolt we audience members are prepared for. The ability to properly build and maintain suspense is perhaps the hardest task for a director, and therefore only a handful in cinema history have held any claim to being a master in this endeavor. There is no threat to their achievements in this film. The weakest area (not trying to give anything away) is the add-on feature of the Action sequences. Not that Harrison Ford is any stranger to Action movies, but when he is transformed into a Jason type of unstoppable maniac, it is almost laughable. All this aside, I think thirty to forty-five minutes could have been cut out of the movie, improving it in the process.

Manhunter is a winner on every level, from directing (but what did you expect from Michael Mann), acting, and all the other major technical jobs.  I actually think it's better than Silence of the Lambs because it involves you more with the characters and what goes into catching a killer thus making it that much more intense.  Now don't get me wrong Silence of the Lambs is really good and Jonathan Demme did a great job but the only reason some think it is the superior Lecter movie is because it is the mainstream Lecter movie, but for that I applaud it (how many other movies has been loved by the public and won oscars yet has a guy sling jizz in a woman's face).  Manhunter is, like all of Mann's movies, kinda artsy but thats also one of the things about his movies that make them so good. And no other directer except maybe Oliver Stone or David Lynch knows how to use music to set the mood better than Michael Mann, be it the score or songs in general.  The performances in Manhunter are all good except William Petersen's and Tom Noonan's which were GREAT!!!  William Petersen does a great job at showing the emotional toll the search for the killer has on him mentally, and I love the fact that he's a good guy with a kind of dark side in him.  There is something in Petersen's face that to me really shows his determination in catching the tooth fairy and he really is an underrated actor who should have bigger roles than he does.  Tom Noonan has made a career out of playing villians (at least until lately), the only ones that kinda stick out are The Ripper from Last Action Hero and Cain in Robocop 2. But those were typical bad guys and his performance as Francis Dollarhyde in Manhunter is hands down the best depiction of a serial killer ever.  Now I say that without knowing anything about serial killers other than whats on the news and in books but I'm sure they have some feelings (nobody's totally evil) and Tom Noonan shows this in his performance.  The killer is a cold blooded killer but has a human side that is shown once he meets Joan Allen's character.  There were scenes between them that really showed (through Noonan's performance) how messed up Dollarhyde is, like when she is kissing him and they have sex there is this look of unease and being totally uncomfortable on his face that really help flesh out the character.  Brian Cox, who played Lecter or actually Lecktor, does great with his performance also but this movie isn't about Lecter so he's only in it for 10 minutes at the most but does great with that time, his Lecter doesn't come off as being the embodiment of evil like the Hopkins performance but his Lecter is more of a sly, manipulitive character.  Not that I'm saying he's better than Anthony Hopkins because Mr. Hopkins deserved everything he got because of his performance but different movies have different interpretations.  The movie does leave out some things about Dollarhyde's past but I think they were not needed because Tom Noonan did enough on his part, but the ending does change a lot but then again after creating such a compelling character as Will Graham (one of my fave characters ever...right up there with William Sommerset from Se7en) I didn't want him to get mutilated and almost killed like in the books ending.  Plus if you think the killer is dead yet there is some hesitation in that AND the killer knows where you live I don't think you would go back to that house with your wife and child like in the book....oh and the kid's name is changed from Willy to Kevin but Willy would sound so corny, can u imagine the scene where Kim Griest says stay here with me...me and Kevin being stay here with me...me and Willy you wouldn't be thinking of the scene itself u would be thinking who the hell would name there child Willy.  And the director's cut does add some more depth to the characters and the new scene at the end where Graham visits the family that was to be Dollarhyde's next victim's is really good, it's not all dialogue like you saved our lives and all that s**t, it's played in the character's face....there needed to be no dialogue for it.  Manhunter is one of the best movies ever in my opinion and will ALWAYS be one of the best of it's sub-genre.  Hat's off to Michael Mann and Anchor Bay for releasing that limited edition DVD.

Now don't get me wrong Silence of the Lambs is really good and Jonathan Demme did a great job but the only reason some think it is the superior Lecter movie is because it is the mainstream Lecter movie, but for that I applaud it (how many other movies has been loved by the public and won oscars yet has a guy sling jizz in a woman's face).  Manhunter is, like all of Mann's movies, kinda artsy but thats also one of the things about his movies that make them so good. And no other directer except maybe Oliver Stone or David Lynch knows how to use music to set the mood better than Michael Mann, be it the score or songs in general.  The performances in Manhunter are all good except William Petersen's and Tom Noonan's which were GREAT!!!  William Petersen does a great job at showing the emotional toll the search for the killer has on him mentally, and I love the fact that he's a good guy with a kind of dark side in him.  There is something in Petersen's face that to me really shows his determination in catching the tooth fairy and he really is an underrated actor who should have bigger roles than he does.  Tom Noonan has made a career out of playing villians (at least until lately), the only ones that kinda stick out are The Ripper from Last Action Hero and Cain in Robocop 2. But those were typical bad guys and his performance as Francis Dollarhyde in Manhunter is hands down the best depiction of a serial killer ever.  Now I say that without knowing anything about serial killers other than whats on the news and in books but I'm sure they have some feelings (nobody's totally evil) and Tom Noonan shows this in his performance.  The killer is a cold blooded killer but has a human side that is shown once he meets Joan Allen's character.  There were scenes between them that really showed (through Noonan's performance) how messed up Dollarhyde is, like when she is kissing him and they have sex there is this look of unease and being totally uncomfortable on his face that really help flesh out the character.  Brian Cox, who played Lecter or actually Lecktor, does great with his performance also but this movie isn't about Lecter so he's only in it for 10 minutes at the most but does great with that time, his Lecter doesn't come off as being the embodiment of evil like the Hopkins performance but his Lecter is more of a sly, manipulitive character.  Not that I'm saying he's better than Anthony Hopkins because Mr. Hopkins deserved everything he got because of his performance but different movies have different interpretations.  The movie does leave out some things about Dollarhyde's past but I think they were not needed because Tom Noonan did enough on his part, but the ending does change a lot but then again after creating such a compelling character as Will Graham (one of my fave characters ever...right up there with William Sommerset from Se7en) I didn't want him to get mutilated and almost killed like in the books ending.  Plus if you think the killer is dead yet there is some hesitation in that AND the killer knows where you live I don't think you would go back to that house with your wife and child like in the book....oh and the kid's name is changed from Willy to Kevin but Willy would sound so corny, can u imagine the scene where Kim Griest says stay here with me...me and Kevin being stay here with me...me and Willy you wouldn't be thinking of the scene itself u would be thinking who the hell would name there child Willy.  And the director's cut does add some more depth to the characters and the new scene at the end where Graham visits the family that was to be Dollarhyde's next victim's is really good, it's not all dialogue like you saved our lives and all that s**t, it's played in the character's face....there needed to be no dialogue for it.  Manhunter is one of the best movies ever in my opinion and will ALWAYS be one of the best of it's sub-genre.  Hat's off to Michael Mann and Anchor Bay for releasing that limited edition DVD.  One more thing this movie has my fave line of dialogue from Lecter, the whole have you ever seen blood in the moonlight scene was cool.

What a load of rubbish.  The original Star Wars, (or now called Episode IV Star Wars A New Hope) is much better.I actually watched this film in 1999 in the cinema, and I thought it was barely passable back then.  I found it irritating, annoying and no real flow.But I didn't really want to write a review of the film until I had saw the original trilogy - I was one of those rare people who hadn't seen the trilogy and wanted to make a fair, balanced judgement of this film.  After seeing the trilogy on video, I can honestly say that this is a complete mess, a complete disappointment and an excuse for Lucas to turn his vision into a money-making scheme, where the force - once something mystical, something all around us and spirtual is now turned into a marketing tagline explained away by chemicals known only as midichlorians.The premise of this is the fact that two Jedi ambassadors are sent to achieve peace from the invading, and so obvious Japanese styled alien invaders.  But of course, they realise its a trap and soon try to rescue the princess or whatever and soon take out the alien invaders which leave Senator Palpatine in control, thus making the situation much worse than it originally was.So, okay the idea and plot isn't bad - every legend needs a first step, and indeed this is it.  I am not complaining about that, what I am complaining about is the sheer horridness of this film.For example, Jar Jar is just a pain in the CGI ass.  What was his role in the film?  Did he have a purpose other than to sell toys?  Of course not, Lucas sold out to toy makers.  The same could be argued about the pod racing - it has no real purpose in the film.The CGI is very well handled, well except for close-ups of Jar Jar and Obi-Wan Kenobi (MacGregor) and the action sequences seem fine until the end where Lucas strives to impose a sense of an adrenaline rush to viewers, but ends up ruining the exceptionally cherographed lightsaber fight sequence.Anakin is also a problem, typecast as a nine year old kid who says Golly and Uh Oh and stuff.  Darth Vader doesn't say stuff like that.  The horridness of Anakin's character is eptiomized when he accidently blows up a younger version of the death star in a fighter jet.  Oh boy, this is just plain bad.Well, Lucas says that this film isn't made for the trilogy fans and says that this is a kids film.  What hogwash, if it were, why would the original trilogy have a darkness style to them?Overall this is a disappointment, not only to a sci-fi fan, but to star wars fans.  Personally I enjoyed Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - which is what this film (indeed the whole trilogy, or the whole sextant) should feel and be like.My overall view is that this film can only be summarized as being disappointing...but even that is an understatement.Overall 3\/10.

There are a lot of people in this world who have ideas like this, but somehow, either by chance or fate, all of them do not have the opportunity to prove themselves. Everyone in this film worked hard under Aronofsky's guidance as director, and it definitely pays off. It's a wholly immersive experience, and it's nice to see risks taken.BadOthers have had the idea of constant music dubbed throughout and the whole artsy euro-blue and green tinting is definitely overdone. I know greens and blue are hip and artsy and fun to look at, but for God's sake, it's old. Steadicam frontal shots have been done. One of the weaknesses of losing focus on the story and angling in on the sensory aspect is that it becomes just something beautiful to watch. I feel the loss of a fun story and miss more of a character driven dialogue aspect. We do see the visual throughline in this movie, so that keeps it together. The effects of drugs, especially on Mrs. Goldfarb, are exaggerated. Diet pills do not equal LSD. Maybe she took too much?Maybe it's wrong to say we shouldn't do something that's already been done. We should applaud a good use of something that already exists, and just because a certain person thinks this is a masterpiece doesn't have any more weight than someone who thinks it sucks.I think it's a great film. There are those who lead and those who follow. Followers will be awed by this, but leaders will be content and assured. The bar has been raised and I have been inspired. I am happy.

Dating back to films like Superman and Blade Runner, a viewer could always be guaranteed at least a ticket into another world. The  Avengers would have been that next big thing for Warner Bros. had it not been so shoddily edited at the last minute. It should be duly noted, however, that this film had all the signs of a thanksgiving turkey It's release date, which was moved from late June to the dog days of August. Then the fact that no press screenings have been allowed for critics. No good can come of these prophecies.The Avengers, which, at best, is a second rate version of the original Batman has all the features of your top blockbuster A Big name or two, a plethora of explosions, and enough special-effects to put Godzilla to shame. The Plot follows the exploits of the legendary secret agents John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), as they do battle with a maniacal meteorologist (Sean Connery) who has intentions on controlling the world's weather. Simple enough. Or so one would have thought. It would appear that some 25 minutes (!) was excised from the film as a result of poor test screenings. As history has told, no good comes from test screenings. As a result, the film becomes so utterly confusing that the viewer would sooner give up, rather than be insulted by a film that insists on staying one step ahead of you at all times. Only potentially good films are butchered in an attempt to make the film more appealing to youngster's attention spans. But make no mistake about it, this film is certainly not for children. Perhaps the last half hour will provide enough enjoyable action (and it does, believe me!) to distract them, but up until then the film consists of awkward dialogue, inane action (Gigantic teddy bears, anyone?), and an uncomfortable overdose of strangeness.The cast, at one time, might have been game, but only once in a while does Ralph Fiennes even crack a smile. Thurman has apparently got the English accent down perfectly, but the only problem lies in the fact that she forgets to give a performance worth remembering. And last, but certainly not least, Sean Connery. Sadly, he doesn't even look like he wants to take over the world. Only once, in a mumbled rant, does he evoke some feelings of evil. That being said, The Avengers is a technical masterpiece. Providing the viewer with a universe of dazzling sets (that should at least be nominated for an oscar), imaginative visual effects, and beautiful costumes, one almost forgets that England doesn't look like this anymore. Unless of course, you live there. The score, composed by Joel McNeely proves to be one of the coolest scores ever produced. Inducing excitement, tension, and a little smoothness, provided by some nifty jazz notes. All of which the film is unable to do itself. For those who won't enjoy this film, it is mercifully brief. So brief to the point that it's strange. It jumps from a one hour section of the beginning to a half hour of climactic action that the viewer blinks and the movie might just be rolling into the credits. One can only hope for an improvement with a director's cut. Until then, this film should gain cult status before it makes it's way to video. Which I'm sure will be soon.Out Of Four - **     ","genre":null},{"date":"7 February 2001","score":"34 out of 49 people found the following review useful","review":"  Warner Bros. fantasies have always had a certain memorable flare.
