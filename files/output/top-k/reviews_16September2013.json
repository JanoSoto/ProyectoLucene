Undoubtedly it laid the foundation of Ray's status as a cultural Indian icon. In neo-realistic fashion the three films were made on actual locations using an amateur cast, shot as close to reality as possible, and due to this approach they show all the unvarnished truths but also the charms found only on the street, addressing life itself. Direct, plain and simple the contained episodes shed light on poverty, anguish, loss and the unending struggle of man to justify his very own existence, the trials and tribulations to transcend one's self and the world one was born in. Central to the continuing story of all films is Apu, a coming of age Bengali boy with the bleakest imaginable prospects. His long journey takes him to many different places, nowhere he is truly at home except in books, and yet despite all that he's contended with the simplest things. But in all the ordeals he has to suffer from there's always a glimpse of hope, an impulse to go on. Until he reaches a dead end...Years after Pather Panchali and part two Aparajito (The Unvanquished) Ray's conclusion of the series via Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) is emotionally the strongest of the three installments. It already starts off with the weight of the first two films on the protagonist's shoulders, lets the now mature Apu question everything he has come to believe in and steers inevitably towards his destiny. Ray has also perfected his directorial techniques in the meantime, and the choices of actors to play an older and finally adult Apu are spot on. Rarely before has poetical realism been so devastatingly beautiful than in this jewel of Indian filmmaking, the pictures often speak for themselves. Like the recurring symbolic image of a train that accompanies us throughout the trilogy first as something magical, then adventurous, even deadly. And it's there in the very last scene as well - as a reminder that roads go ever, ever on. And all a road requires is a first step.

I remember that Friday night in 1962 going to bed wondering if I'd get up in the morning. It was truly ghastly to feel that the whole civilised world could be blown to bits by lunatics like Gen. Curtis Lemay and Gen. Lemnitzer. Of course, the war party ultimately won by Kennedy getting assassinated, something that traumatized my whole life and has never been resolved. Gen. Lemnitzer got promoted to run the whole of NATO and the hideous Gladio programme that distorted European politics. All those guys are still there and they faked the 9\/11 events to promote more war in the 21st century it's so sad that the US public gets lied to again and again, and just laps it up or turns off. Kennedy was the one guy who had a chance to turn over a new leaf, and it was stolen from him --- and from his brother. This is a very sad film, in view of what transpired although, sadly, few Americans are aware of what happened afterwards, or even before, such as the Bay of Pigs fiasco that led directly to this trauma, and got Lemnitzer fired by Kennedy. We now know that Kennedy was corresponding with Kruschev throughout.
