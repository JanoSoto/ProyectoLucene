In 1967 or 1968 I saw Born Losers at the theater. That was the movie where Billy Jack first appeared. It was pretty bad, but at least it was a good guy, bad guy movie. The motorcycle gang comes into town and Billy Jack kicks some serious butt. So, when I saw the trailer for Billy Jack 3 or 4 years later, I decided to spend a couple of hours and give it a watch. Was I disappointed! I am not comparing this movie to the movies of today. I had been going to movies for years before I saw this one, so I was comparing it to current movies of the time. It was, and still is awful. The only 'message' the comes across in the end is, if somebody murders somebody, you murder them back. You don't give them a chance to have a trial, you kill them. Then, you act like a victim when you are arrested for murder yourself. Everybody is corrupt, the police, the court, the politicians, anybody with money, etc. And strangely enough, NOBODY in the entire nation can see this...except you and your spaced out friends. And the only way you can get anybody's attention is to commit murder...in the name of peace and love. Give me a vomit bucket. I was around for a couple of decades before this movie came out, and I was in the military in Viet-Nam, so I have first hand knowledge of the state of our country when this film was made. And believe me, it doesn't reflect anything even remotely resembling the state of the country at the time. The only thing it does do is prove the American Dream can be achieved by anybody. A below average director, writer and actor can become quite wealthy making a substandard movie.

This is a charming original film from director Chris Noonan who really hasn't put much on the screen in his career but is currently working on three new films including Mrs. Potter starring Renée Zellweger as children's author Beatrix Potter which will bring his name back into prominence. Noonan co-wrote this script along with the film's producer George Miller based on the Dick King Smith novel. Babe was nominated for seven Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Art Direction, film editing, Effects and Screenplay and took home the Oscar for Best Effects. Jim Henson's Creature Shop creators did the animatronics for this. Andrew Lesnie who would go on to do the Lord of the Rings trilogy of films is the cinematographer. James Cromwell in his Academy Award nominated role as Best Actor is Farmer Hoggett and Magda Szubanski is great as his wife Mrs. Hoggett. Christine Cavanaugh who has done voices for animated TV shows The Rugrats, Dexter's Laboratory and The Critic among others is the voice of Babe the pig. This is a clever and sweet movie with lots of laughs too. I would give this a 9.0 on a scale of 10 and highly recommend it.

The chemistry between the two may not be the same as the way it was between Richard Gere and Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman and Runaway Bride. But then the story is much different here.

I'm not going to tell you what the movie is about, there are plenty of others doing that. Just allow me to tell you it is worth seeing. I almost turned it off in the beginning, but got busy with something, left it on, and then started getting interested and ended up stopping what I was doing and watched the whole thing. I thought it was going to be some simple minded movie, but don't go by first appearances with an old Mexican guy playing his music box and dancing around an old - near ghost town looking - Southwest town. When you find out later who he is you understand. By starting out that way though, it was then more difficult to keep a person watching. I think Hollywood forgets that today, people watch movies on DVD and VHS and can turn them off quickly as it is too busy a world to waste time. I'm no fan of Robert Redford but have to hand it to him, he did a good job of directing. The only other thing he did that I liked was Jeremiah Johnson. The rest of the time he was either over acting or deluding himself that he knows better than the rest of us. In fact, he should have received an award from his buddies in Hollywood on this one. The acting was top notch too. Every person in the movie was very believable and made you care, except maybe Christopher Walken who was a little wooden in his part as the big, mean bad guy. Melanie Griffith was a little shallow but perhaps I am being unfair as that is the part she was playing - the shallow wife of the big shot money man. I am not familiar with the actresses who played the two top parts, but they were excellent and attractive besides. Joe, the fellow who grows the bean field did a good job as well as the old fellow who talks to Saints who was especially talented.

The singing of the French national anthem is antithetical to that scene in Cabaret where the young Nazis sing The World Belongs to Me. See this if you never have.

Along with Night of the Creeps and Killer Klowns from Outer Space, Critters definitely is the most successful horror-comedy of the 80's and it actually even manages to be much better than the blockbuster it obviously borrowed its ideas from, namely Joe Dante's Gremlins. The screenplay also uses story elements of innumerable other movies (the farm-setting, the space prison concept&#133;) and yet it never really directly rips off any of them, which is quite an admirable effort. Hairy little space monsters, with funky red eyes and an insatiable appetite, escape from their prison transport and land in rural Kansas where they immediately attack farmer Jay Brown's cattle and family. The son of the family tries to reach the nearby village for help, but the Critters (or Krites, as they're called in space) make it impossible to get away. Luckily enough, there also are two intergalactic bounty hunters with heavy artillery looking for the murderous furballs. The story opens a little slow with an overly extended family portrait of the Browns but, once the critters are rolling over the earth and eating their way through the countryside, Stephen Herek's film is both funny and action-packed at the same time. The dialogs are surprisingly witty and contain numerous references towards great Sci-Fi classics. Particularly the bounty hunters are hilarious, with one of them impersonating a famous rock star and the other indecisive about what appearance he wants to take on. The sharp-teethed Critters are engaging creations, made by the endlessly talented Chiodo-brothers of the aforementioned Killer Klowns&#133; The acting performances are rather forgettable. M. Emmet Walsh is underused as the town's sheriff and Dee Wallace Stone tries to look too much like a teenage scream queen.

Then out of desperation, they found out that Judy Garland was available, but then she went off on one of her drug-riddled nut case acts and went into the hospital, and then someone asked, Who's available? And someone said, Jane Powell and Astaire yelled out - Grab her! And they did, and even Astaire in his autobiography said that everyone was surprised at how well she handled the dance numbers even though, primarily, she wasn't a dancer, but then this was a good plus for Jane Powell.Jane Powell was not an adult and couldn't play teenage rolls anymore, and in her last film Two Weeks for Love she looked quite silly dressed up looking like a teenager, so when the chance to do Royal Wedding came along, this is what got her into adult rolls, and no matter, what anyone says, I thought her second film after this Rich, Young, and Pretty was a super-fine musical show and very much ignored! So, what was Royal Weeding about? The show was written loosely built around Fred Astaire and his sister Adele's life when they were a dance team, and yes, Adele, just as Ellen, Jane Powell's role, married a Lord in England and gave up her career which eventually led Fred to go into the movies, and, of course, the rest is history! There's been a lot of controversial discussion about how the number was done when Fred Astaire dances of the walls and ceiling of his hotel room.

The use of shadow and music in this film to heighten emotion and character is sheer brilliance. The limited dialogue only adds to the tension of this picture.

The genius of the writing is shown during the scene in the bar, where gunfighting is compared to music. Do not be mistaken, this movie is more than an ordinary western. This is movie is about the fundamental difference in good versus evil, in hate versus love, or survival versus revenge. There is more than meets the eye and this film shows that a western, or an action film, does not need to be gruesome and gory to be interesting and exciting. And it proves that an exciting film can pluck the heart-strings just as any story of star crossed lovers can. The Writing and directing and the music are all there, not too mention the action. Henry Fonda plays the darkest meanest character in his career and Charles Bronson, as his foil and opposite, is stunning to watch. It is my belief that Charles Bronson is a very underrated actor and Sergio Leone simply did not make enough Films. If you are a fan of the western and of movies that require an active part from their audience, check this one out...you won't be disappointed.

This is a film that neither my husband, my teenage son, or myself can resist watching time after time, whenever it happens to be on TV.The movie tells the tale of Mick Dundee, a charismatic adventurer from Walkabout Creek in the Australian outback, who ends up as a 'croc out of water' (as some reviewers have cleverly phrased it) in New York City. Naturally, there's a 'sheila' with him, a love interest in the form of beautiful blonde American journalist, Sue Charlton. The sparks fly between them, the chemistry cooks, and so on.This movie of course is made solely by the legendary character of Mick Dundee, played to charming perfection by Paul Hogan, both in his native bush and also Big City settings. You'll be in stitches, you'll cheer for him, you'll be amazed at his adaptation of his unique Down Under bush survival skills to the streets of the Big Apple. The knife incident...what can I say? He displays an endearing innocence of the seedier aspects of Big City life, notably its drugs and prostitutes. But it's not only Mick's humour and charisma, this adventurer is a guy with integrity that would put most everyone, rural or urban, Australian or American, to shame. The greatest supporting role here must surely go to Mick's bush buddy, Wally, who's basically 'all talk and no action', yet one of the most likable ever film characters.The ending? I won't give it away, but it's a dilly, a dandy, and a doozy. Just one of the many reasons I can watch this great movie again and again. The first Crocodile Dundee sequel is equally entertaining, and though the second (Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles) doesn't quite measure up, I can never resist watching Mick in action.

Everything I had read about it led me to believe it was a depressing film. Most films about alcoholics aren't pretty and this was about an alcoholic AND a down-and-out hooker, so how much fun could it be?Maybe because I expected the worst, I found it a pleasant surprise. Sure, the two people weren't exactly winners in life but the movie wasn't that depressing, was it? And the film had style and good acting performances from the two leads Nicholas Cage and Elisabeth Shue, right?Yes, but on further review, as they say in the pro football telecasts, my review has changed 180 degrees. I must have had too many drinks like Ben to like this movie in first place. Hey, I am far from any prude but this is nothing but slickly-wrapped soft porn. It's Sleaze with, yes, a capital S. I can't even describe half the stuff Shue described in this movie, casually discussing almost every sexual act you can think of. Maybe that's cool to critics like Ebert, who thought this was the number one movie of the year. it's just another example of the sick state of mind in the film world, from filmmakers to actors to critics, where pushing the envelope is the way to go. It started escalating with Midnight Cowboy getting the Academy Award and keeps going, through American Beauty and the sleazy films you saw nominated for this year's Best Picture.Cage won the Academy Award for Best Actor here, and I don't have a problem with that. Shue was equally as good but I found out more than one viewing is like having too many drinks - not good. It's sad to see soft-porn sordidness because stylish.

We had to watch it in a class on the afterlife in school and its premise was interesting....sorta.One of the biggest problems is the acting. Brooks tries to sound like he's doing stand up comedy in the middle of conversation. Sorry Al, only Jerry Seinfeld can do that (and even Seinfeld can do it badly too). The whole ordeal about Jeeps in the beginning should have given me a hint, but I ignored it. I would think that since the SOB wrote the damn thing that maybe he would give himself a more interesting character. But he doesn't. Rather, Daniel Miller is shown as this supposedly funny guy who by the sheer grace of God (who is conspicuously absent in this whole ordeal, which shows that the only kind of world where Albert Brooks is allowed to write, star, and direct his movies, is in a godless Hell) is able to win over Meryl Streep, for reasons that are too stupid to discuss further.The other biggest problem is the whole story. I believe Donnie Darko said it best that you can't just combine all human emotion into Fear and Love, it just shows ignorance to the human condition of outside, mitigating circumstances...OK he didn't say the last part, I added that in for fun. But, having Fear and Courage as the basis to get into heaven is just a complete mockery of the divine ideal. To dumb down the afterlife to this human creation of a hearing, with judges and attorneys, just shows that Brooks was attempting to show heaven in a way that can relate to the ever-deteriorating human mind. It fails.The ending is also so ridiculously predictable. Because he wanted to have sex with Meryl Streep, he gets into heaven, but when he doesn't, that means he's a failure at life? Kind of showing Streep on a pedestal I see. Okay, I want to have sex too. If I impregnate an underage girl, but show courage, then do I get into heaven? Awesome! The only reason this even gets a 2 is because of the Past Lives Pavilion with the sumo wrestler and the girl with the doll. And I mean, that is really it.
