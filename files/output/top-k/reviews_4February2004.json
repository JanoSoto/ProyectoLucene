The reality is that the filmed position is based on A King's Gambit opening played by grandmasters Spassky (White) and Bronstein (Black) and was played in the 1960 USSR championship.I can give you the moves if you like as the game only lasted 23 moves and as in the film, was won by White.The difference to the piece position in the film being superficial to its actuality and with the SMERSH agent Kronsteen (Vladek Sheybal, inspired casting) playing White.In FRWL the opening scene takes place at the Venice International Tournament where Kronsteen ignores a courier's sealed message ordering him to stop play on the spot.He knows he risks his life if he fails to obey, but how many players can abandon a sure win?

He turns around, looks at her and says, I think of a man, and I take away reason and accountability. The secret of As Good As It Gets is its unconventional, and often times irreverent, view of the entire romance scene. It is centered solely on two people, Melvin (Jack Nicholson) and Carol (Helen Hunt). Melvin writes those corny romance novels you always manage to find tucked in between the fiction and non-fiction area of your local bookstore. You know, the kind that little old ladies like to read through at an incredible speed in an ill-fated hope to re-live moments of their past.Melvin is a bit like Paul Sheldon, from Rob Reiner's Misery, although I'm sure if he had been found by a murderous fan he would have been killed early on--he's incredibly blunt and annoying. He probably would have told Annie Wilkes what he thought of her from the get-go, not hesitating any more than he has to.Melvin has obsessive-compulsive disorder, which basically means he goes through strange routines every time he does something, whether it means locking a door twice or not stepping on the cracks of a sidewalk (we all do that, sometimes). I recently read a new Steve Martin novella about a man with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and it reminded me very much of As Good As It Gets and the Melvin character. Melvin is such a wacko that he pushes his gay neighbor's dog down the laundry chute after he finds it wandering around the hallway.The gay man is played by Greg Kinnear. His name is Simon, and he has a small little dog he likes to call precious. Simon is an artist, but when a band of kids wreck his apartment and beat him up, he is left with the realization that he hasn't enough money to keep his flat, and his boyfriend (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) may break up with him.But the biggest worry of all is...what to do with his precious?Frank, played by Gooding Jr., decides to give the dog to Melvin--who refuses at first but is left without any option but to obey. He soon achieves a certain subtle love for the beast, and when Simon has healed and comes back for the dog, it doesn't even want to leave. It even starts to develop nasty habits--like avoiding cracks in the sidewalk.Meanwhile, a troubled single mother and a part-time waitress, Carol is constantly nagged by Melvin. Only she can deliver him food. Only she can take his order. Only she can kick him out of the restaurant. Mistaking this for some sort of sexual craving, she tells Melvin flat-out that she will never sleep with him. He doesn't seem to care. That had never even crossed his mind.The fact is that Melvin is insufferably lonely. He likes to act as though he likes to be lonely, but the truth is that his loneliness is something he loathes. He would love to reach out and gain some friends--but he's too proud to humble himself in such a way. We all know people like Melvin--he just takes himself to a new extreme.Melvin is surely one of the great screen characters of all time, ranking up there with Raymond Rain Man Babbitt and Forrest Gump as some of the most unique and likable inventions to ever grace the big screen. Nicholson presents his character in an especially effective way--at first he seems gruff, then he seems strange, then his soft side is revealed, and he slowly becomes the likable mean guy who lives upstairs and likes to try and kill neighbors' dogs.Hunt won the Oscar for her work in As Good As It Gets, but it was truly Nicholson who deserved it.Regardless of all this, As Good As It Gets still stands alone as one of the cleverest romantic comedies of all time, and certainly one that both sexes can agree on. The film features some of the most memorable lines ever written on paper, the majority of them all coming from the lips of Melvin Udall, perfectly spoken by a typical gruff Jack Nicholson. They all come off as utterly hilarious and convincing. (Nicholson How old are you? If I would guess by your eyes, I'd say you're fifty. Hunt If I went by your eyes I'd say you were kind.)This is the type of new-age romantic comedy that rivals the greatness of When Harry Met Sally or Sleepless in Seattle. It's founded in its characters, their lives, their interaction, and how they learn to overcome their own personal obstacles and moral obligations. This film carries all the Autumn-time sweetness and cleverness of a Rob Reiner comedy, and all the lightness of a Frank Capra movie. It's a delightful blend of comedy and romance, and the type of redefining genre motion picture that When Harry Met Sally was eight years prior. What a perfect, delightful movie.4.5\/5 stars.- John Ulmer ","genre":null},{"date":"4 February 2004","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" How do you write women so well? asks a flattered young lady after reading one of the man's sappy romantic paperback novels and recognizing his face on the street.

At first, I didn't love it but I knew that I didn't hate it, so I watched it again the next day.

Mission Impossible 2 is a film that suffered from the pretense that it believed it was a good film. Unfortunately, this moviegoer was tricked into thinking that it would be an 'unreal' film. How wrong I was, as I had a very negative experience, as I found it boring for the most part. I have to ask, why is that Hollywood cannot get the 'Mission Impossible' formula the way I like it?The world's greatest spy, Ethan Hunt is partnering up with the beautiful Nyah Hall to stop renegade agent Sean Ambrose from releasing a new kind of terror on an unsuspecting world. But before the mission is complete they'll traverse the globe and have to choose between everything they love and everything they believe in.I was truly disappointed in the direction that MI2 was given. John Woo (from the brilliant action thriller Face\/Off), was the man in charge, and I believe he was the wrong man for this job. He really over did many things in this film. But the most overdone and frustrating part of the film for me, has to be the way Woo just had to keep showing things in slow motion. If Woo had done these shots a few times that would have been ok, but he had to do umpteen times.However Woo got the right look to the film. The shots of the mountain tops, the Aussie landscape which included the outback and of Australian city, Sydney, really did impress me. Woo had cinematographer Jeffery L. Kimball doing this aspect of the movie, and visually I found nothing wrong to the film.The same cannot be said for the script of MI2, which once again was disappointing. The story was the inspiration of Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga, different men to the first MI film. However the screenplay writer, Robert Towne was back for a second shot at this story. Unfortunately all these writers got this story totally wrong again. I believe this because of the crazy plot, which involves the silly virus, just not good enough. Then with this as the sole focus of the story, we get another story that becomes very complex, confusing and at times rather boring. Another complaint in this story has to be the character creations, which are pathetic, especially the bad guys, who are not convincing at all.Main character of MI2 is Ethan Hunt (Producer Tom Cruise). As I have mentioned previously, Cruise certainly looks the part in these films, and while he was ok in the role of Hunt this time, I still think he needs more MIF members to help counterbalance the film's spy aspects. Hunt's mentor in the film is Mission Commander Swanbeck (Sir Anthony Hopkins), who was well casted in his small role.The female lead in MI2 is Nyah Hall (the gorgeous Thandie Newton). She is a professional thief recruited to help Hunt on his mission. We learn that Hall used to be romantically involved with a defective agent. Nyah is asked to do a very dangerous job, one that could cost her life. Luther (Ving Rhames) is again an ok character, but he does not have a great affect on me. But a funny new man was Billy Baird (John Polson), who has a very over exaggerated Australian accent, but for some reason I did not mind that.The bad guy here is a man by the name of the Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), who is not a nice man at all. He is driven to get his hands on this new deadly virus, and noting will stop him from getting it. Ambrose is a pathetic bad guy, poorly acted by Scott, as he did not get me overawed like a good bad guy can and should do. Ambrose's right hand man is also just as bad. His name is Hugh Stamp (Richard Roxburgh) and knowing that this guy is Australian, he has a terrible accent all the way through this movie.MI2 has some good sequences and some very bad sequences. I enjoyed the start as it opened the movie up nicely. But after the race course scenes, the film gets lost in a rather boring sequence, where Hunt is trying to get a hold of the deadly virus guns. This scene is bad reminder for me, as it is just like the vault scene in the first MI film.Yet the ending does make up for some of this film's short falls. The bike\/car chase is really well shot, but unfortunately John Woo had to overuse the slow mo shots which ruined it for me a little. Then the final confrontation between Hunt and Ambrose was fine, up until a point where see a knife held extremely close to Hunt's eyeball. Now these shots are supposed totally thrill us as the audience, but once again they did not work on me.I also want to give my opinion on this movie's marketing. I feel that it was crap the way that they made the film look so much cooler and better than actually was, mainly via its trailer. The whole glasses thrown at the screen really did build this film up, but in retrospect, I find it to be totally 'wanky'. I am now very careful not to get the right or wrong impression of a movie via its promotion and or trailer, mainly because of MI2.I have learned that they are doing a Mission Impossible 3 very soon.

I am unsure if I will ever like a Hollywood inspired 'Mission Impossible' film, because for some reason the powers behind each individual film does not do, what I relate to being in the MI story.

After breaking his word again by missing Jamie's karate grading, Howard resolves to redeem himself and his marriage by fulfilling Jamie's ultimate Christmas wish, an action figure of Turbo-Man, a popular children TV superhero. Unfortunately, as is the habit with him, Howard has promised to buy that figure earlier that year and then promptly forgotten about it. To make things even harder, Turbo-Man toys are the must-have gifts of the season, and stocks of Turbo-Man toys are quickly drying up all over the country. Desperate not to disappoint his family again, Howard embarks on an epic city-wide quest to find the toy everyone's looking for. Along the way, Howard encounters Myron Larabee, a postal worker dad with a rival ambition, and the two quickly become bitter competitors in their race for the action figure. The chase begins to arise the ire of a police officer whom Howards keeps running into, and one of the most memorable scenes includes Howard desperately hooking up with a band of brand-spoofing crooks and ending up thrashing them. In addition, Ted attempts to hit on Liz, which she eventually turns down hard. The search climaxes with both dads masquerading as live action stuntman in a department store parade. As the real Turbo-Man, Howard uses the opportunity to present a coveted limited-edition Turbo-Man doll to his son in the crowd. But before he can recognize his dad, Jaime is chased around the parade by Myron, dressed as Turbo-Man's arch nemesis Dementor.Jingle All the Way is just one of those movies that you wonder how in the heck it got green lighted. It's just so stupid, I love how the ending, Myron tries to kill a child to get a stupid toy for his son and all is forgiven so easily. Gotta love how Turbo-Man has an Austrian accent, muscle bound, square jaw, tall... yet his own kid doesn't recognize him at all. Even the one scene that had a great joke, the bomb that was wrapped as a present, they even ruined that with a lousy slapstick joke that I know it was a family movie, but it just was stupid. But give or take, it's not that bad of a movie, there are some good jokes in it. I can't give Arnold a bad review, I just can't, it's not in my blood as a critic. There are some moments that are very funny like Arnold screaming at his neighbor for eating his wife's cookies. Also Arnold is just too likable as well as Phil Hartman.

There are some moments that are very funny like Arnold screaming at his neighbor for eating his wife's cookies. Also Arnold is just too likable as well as Phil Hartman.

This is one of the scariest films of all time. First off, we have Arnold Schwarzenegger, The Terminator, he's playing this wacky almost like 80's silly comedy show type of Father Knows Best. Second, I think this is the film that just gives up on us, it goes from alright to stupid to silly to bad to just plain awful. Third there is nothing redeemable about this movie the terrible acting, the lousy story, the crappy moral behind it's shallow message, and Arnold's accent, granted the accent has gotten him a career, but still it's disturbing the way he presents some of his lines. Not to mention that for some odd reason they put Sinbad in this movie, sorry to say but he is just not funny, actually no body, even one of the best voice actors of all time Phil Hartmen... I can't believe he took on this movie.Howard Langston is often busy at his job, and has a hard time finding time for his wife, Liz and his young son, Jamie - especially when compared to next door superdad divorcé, Ted Maltin. After breaking his word again by missing Jamie's karate grading, Howard resolves to redeem himself and his marriage by fulfilling Jamie's ultimate Christmas wish, an action figure of Turbo-Man, a popular children TV superhero. Unfortunately, as is the habit with him, Howard has promised to buy that figure earlier that year and then promptly forgotten about it. To make things even harder, Turbo-Man toys are the must-have gifts of the season, and stocks of Turbo-Man toys are quickly drying up all over the country. Desperate not to disappoint his family again, Howard embarks on an epic city-wide quest to find the toy everyone's looking for. Along the way, Howard encounters Myron Larabee, a postal worker dad with a rival ambition, and the two quickly become bitter competitors in their race for the action figure. The chase begins to arise the ire of a police officer whom Howards keeps running into, and one of the most memorable scenes includes Howard desperately hooking up with a band of brand-spoofing crooks and ending up thrashing them.

She is also in need of some sex, as a couple scenes prove.I suppose probably being as bored as she is more so than being polite, she befriends Tatiana after being wary of her at first. Strangely, she starts to place way to much trust in this person (leaving her to watch the baby, etc.), but that just shows Sasha is so pent up that she'll take any chance she gets to have some relief. As they get chummier, Tatiana starts to show to the audience signs of being a bit unstable (you got to see one such scene for yourself!), and later Sasha finds her weird notebook drawings but doesn't seem to think much of it (we all doodle, right?). Later when Sasha offers her most trusting friendliness, Tatiana finally does what she has to do, starting with a scene that at first looks more a return of friendship than what really happens. (Even though what finally happens is a bit predictable, it doesn't take away from its impact since such a thing is always disturbing and tragic.)Overall, this was an enjoyable film, if you are into concise, well shot and acted drama with talented actresses.

I hope that I meet a guy like James one day, he was just so lovable. I also adored Bruce Willis' voice, he was a perfect fit for Mikey.

Kristy Alley, she plays the crazy mother, but you see all that her character goes through and you just feel awful for her. This is such a great movie, I highly recommend it if you get the chance to see it, it's a great classic.7\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance"},{"date":"4 February 2004","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Watching a movie you last saw 36 years ago can be a disconcerting experience; disconcerting because so little of it is familiar.

I believe this because it has great thrills and tension, and some very funny and humorous moments. But best of all, this part of the Star Wars epic continues on the fantasy that I loved to escape as a child, and I still can now as an adult.The battle to save the galaxy from the evil Empire rages on as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and Chewbacca face attack by the Imperial forces While Han and Leia escape, Luke sets off to Dagobah in search of Jedi Master, Yoda. Only with the Jedi Master's help will Luke survive when the dark side of the force beckons him into a life or death duel with the fearsome Darth Vader.The screenplay to this part in the Star Wars puzzle was very good indeed. It was written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan. The best aspect of the screenplay has to be the raw emotion that it presents. Not many Sci-fi movies can boast having this in their story, but ESB has.It does so through, the relationship of Luke and Yoda, Han and Leia's and through Luke and Darth Vader's confrontation. Yet the story also encapsulates some very funny humour, between Han Solo and Princess Leia, and R2D2 and C3PO. These characters are very funny for the best part of the film. Yet the battle between the Good and Dark sides of the force, continues to make the story very entertaining. Both Leigh and Lawrence do justice to the story that Lucas had created for ESB.Although George Lucas was only the executive producer of ESB, you can still fill the Lucas presence on the film. Director of ESB was a man by the name of Irvin Kershener. I have learnt that this film helped to keep his career on track. I love the way that Irvin made this movie seem like such a thrilling joyride, an area that a fan like me, believes all these films need to be successful. He also allowed us to see very closely what each individual battle was like and gave insight into most confrontations or relationships. It was a very balanced and professional performance from Kershener.In this part of the Star Wars story, Luke Skywalker (performed well by Mark Hamill) is a young space fighter, who believes with no doubt that he will be a Jedi. To be sure, Luke travels to meet with Yoda, Jedi master (Frank Oz). The way that we see Luke and Yoda, during Luke's training to prove that he is a Jedi, is a very touching moment in the entire film. Yoda is a creature that was created by Oz and Lucas, to seem 'real' and that is what I feel he was. Movie critic Roger Ebert said that 'Yoda may actually give the best performance in the movie', and I totally agree.The other good characters include Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and the robot droids R2D2 (Kenny Baker) and C3PO (Anthony Daniels). Han and Leia, continue to say that they are not in love with each other, when everything points to that being the case. Their characters have a great amount of sexual tension and innuendo, a real highlight for me. However supposed friend, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) betrays Han and his friends, handing them over to the dark side of the force.Yet the continuation of the humorous droids is still as funny as ever in my view. R2D2 is a feisty little robot, who can do breathtaking things. But by looking at him, you would think he just another useless piece of space. He has a constant companion in C3PO, who always seems pretty reserved and tentative when he sees R2D2 doing something dangerous. Most of the responses from C3PO are classic.The dark side of the force still has a great effect on me, when I come to watching this film. The powerful person on the force is Darth Vader (body by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones). Vader in this film shows how cruel, evil, harsh, hateful and driven he is. There are many moments where generals and commanders fail Vader, with the consequence of this not that pleasant. Vader is also another of my all-time favourite Star Wars characters.There are many moments I liked in ESB. The start of the film is wonderful, as we see Luke in major trouble with a scary ice monster. Then Luke and the rebellion have a grand battle with the enemy, which I still find to be entertaining. Then when the battle turns to open space, it is just as exciting, as I start to feel like I want to be in a space ship and give all I have got, to defend the honour of good side of the force. Finally the conclusion of the film is terrific. Firstly, we see Han Solo given a rather unpleasant and creepy demise that certainly upsets Chewy. Then the finale, with Luke battling Vader was marvelous, as we learn through the battle that not all is as Luke seems.In closing, 'The Empire Strikes Back' is one of the great sci-fi movies we have seen. Star Wars may have started it, but ESB certainly continues it in a very great and grand way.  This film also gets me very emotional, which just goes to show how passionate I am about these films. With these films now given to us in Special Edition, the way they were supposed to be, it is a great treat for all the fans. This is one of the best movie sequels the world has had the privilege to see and no-one will change mind about that.CMRS gives 'The Empire Strikes Back' 5 (Brilliant Film)  ","genre":null},{"date":"4 February 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  After 23 years, and now available to watch in 'Special Edition', the way it supposed to be, George Luca's 'The Empire Strikes Back' is the best Star Wars film of the trilogy.

Not so much that I didn't enjoy it at least a little bit.Swordfish was a sort-of enjoyable movie with delusions of grandeur. It wanted to be deep, it wanted to be unpredictable, it wanted to be political, but really only succeeded in being nice eye-candy that also supplied a few cool quotes. The most interesting thing in the movie was that the relationship between Stanley (Hugh Jackman) and his daughter was fully fleshed out and believable. Gabriel's character (John Travolta) was refreshingly amoral and willing to act on his beliefs, but ultimately you feel like there's more flash than substance to him. That character was the other high point in the movie though.There are a few stunts we haven't seen, a few really cool action shots, an interesting take on the hijacker's getaway, and lots of explosions. It's fun, it looks cool, and it spackles over the holes in the plot.Like every other movie that deals with computers, the hacking scenes are absurd. Not that I'm such an expert, but hell, a dictionary crack would work just as well as the Swiss Army Knife, open anything anywhere tactical nuke of a program he writes.

He was the meek nerd doing his best young Woody Allen impersonation in Little Shop of Horrors (1986), and he was absolutely perfect as Barney in My Blue Heaven, which was--at the time--his fourth pairing with Steve Martin. (They ended up making four films together.)Tom Arnold has never been particularly funny. He showed some signs of talent in True Lies (1994), but everything after that just went downhill. Here's a guy who has appeared in some of the worst films and television shows of the last decade, including McHale's Navy (1997) and The Stupids. In fact, I went to the theater to see McHale's Navy upon its release and felt like vomiting from the first five minutes into it. Big Bully is Rick Moranis' worst film and one of Tom Arnold's best, if that's saying anything.I'll admit that the beginning of Big Bully was quite funny. There are many laugh-out-loud segments. But, unfortunately, they are drowned out by an over-the-top and truly awful, ridiculous ending, in which a man's old bully from school goes after him again with weapons from a wood-carving class. (Be careful, your kids may never want to go back to school again.)Rick Moranis is the man who is attacked. His name is David, and the film opens with a younger version of himself being chased down a street and up against a metal gate by a chubby fellow his own age. We assume that he is beaten to a pulp, but before we see anything, it all fades away.Years later, David has a son of his own, and has since moved out into the big city. But he's tired of the city life, and after his wife leaves him, David decides to move back to his home town, along with his son. They arrive, he finds out he has hundreds of dollars due on a Dr. Seuss book he got out from the library years ago (funny segment there), and he moves into his new home. David soon teaches school, where he finds out that an old bully of his, Fang (Tom Arnold), is teaching carving.David gets scared, runs away from Big Bully (who seems to be nice now, and truly wants a friendship with the man) throughout the film, until, in a scary moment, he realizes Fang really is still a psycho, and the two men battle it out in the school, in ridiculous, childish gags and moments.Alas, that's all the film is comprised of, with scattered--and very predictable--ideas involving romantic interests and such cliches. It's too bad--this was a decent premise to begin with.Big Bully literally massacred Rick Moranis' career, and since then he has appeared in only a few real films--unless you count straight-to-video animated and live-action Disney-esque films real movies.This is just hideous, a film to rival the bad qualities of McHale's Navy and The Stupids. The movie is tolerable in an annoying sort of way until the climactic finale, which is so out of control and awful that it really just makes you want to throw up.This is one bad movie. I can't imagine a worse result stemming from such a poor comedian mixed with such a great one. Rick Moranis should sue, and Tom Arnold should die. But that's just my opinion. I'm not going to be a bully about it, or anything.0.5\/5 stars.- John Ulmer ","genre":null},{"date":"4 February 2004","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Rick Moranis has always been a very funny guy.

I'm certain he wanted to create this amazingly phantasmagoric horror film with over-the-top visuals and ideas. Unfortunately, not much of it works.The catastrophically UGLYCasting Richard Burton as a priest one of the worst bits of casting ever. Burton doesn't look like a Catholic priest. He's looks like someone who had too much of a good life. Also, casting an actor who made movies in the 1940s, 1950s was wrong. They should have looked for someone who was more contemporary. The effect of having an old-fashion movie star Burton in a crazy contemporary dream-like horror film is jarring! It just doesn't work.The ending after Burton finds Kokumo, what little sense or semblance of quality the movie vanish in a blink of an eye. When everyone heads back to the house where the first movie took place, the film is totally derailed beyond repair. It's really bad and makes me wonder what were they thinking. When we see evil Blair dressed up in Fredericks of Hollywood lingerie and vamping it out and trying to be sexy, the whole film (and even the first movie) is hurt by the extreme cheesiness of it all. The good thing about the first movie was the total lack of cheesiness about it. It felt authentic. Never Hollywoodish. Well, not the ending of the sequel. If Evil Blair in EXORCIST II had remained like the ugly possessed one we saw in the first movie and not the sexy vampy one, the ending might have been a tad better but making Blair sexy in order to turn on celibate Burton is just too silly for words. The house falling apart and the swarm of locusts coming to Washington was okay but it added nothing to the whole thing. What's really funny is that with the car crashing in the fence, the house crumbling and the locusts swarm buzzing all about, you'd think some of the neighbors would have noticed something. Also, what happens to Regan and Father Lamont? Where do they go?The ending in EXORCIST II is truly bad and sends this John Boorman flick in the PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE category. It's the most unintentionally hilarious ending ever conceived for the silver screen.And it's a shame because as bad as the ending is, there are some startlingly original moments in the first hour which have actually influenced movies and filmmakers up to this day. The dream-like quality seen in EXORCIST II feels very contemporary and after watching it recently, it made me realise how influential that approach was.
