One is that it is early Hitchcock and one would want to see the master of suspense's entire resume anyways, and two; is that it's widely considered to be Britain's first talkie! 'Blackmail' was initially filmed as a silent thriller, and was innovative changed into a talkie halfway through the production.The story revolves around a young woman named Alice (Anny Ondra), who is dating Detective Frank Webber (John Longden), and for some reason or another she decides to ditch to meet with another man. That man being an artist named Mr. Crewe (Cyril Ritchard). Crewe convinces Alice to come up to his apartment\/studio, and eventually attempts to rape her. Alice then stabs Crewe dead, and is panicked by the situation. Fortunately for her, Frank Webber is assigned to the case, but unfortunately for her, a man named Tracy (Donald Calthrop) knows the truth, and he wants to capitalise on the situation with the intention of blackmail.To say the least, 'Blackmail' is not very suspenseful, scary or enthralling. It's extremely slow-paced in parts, and some of the soundtrack is a little off as it goes from silent to sound. However, it's very innovative for the time with it's use of the sound, especially during Alice's breakfast scene, which displayed a cliché that being copied over and over- where one word triggered an emotive state of a character yet the audience is hearing inaudible. Not perfect in the cliché's original form as it seemed amateurish by today's standards, but Hitchcock's experimental nature for that scene would have worked well back then. I was also impressed with the dubbing of Alice's voice, which was never Anny Ondra's real voice. I found it actually worked reasonably well, where other voice dubs did not. The storyline and the blackmail itself were hardly engrossing and it was turned around too quickly. I never felt the characters were that cornered, and Tracy simply felt like a bum trying to get a free meal. Though Hitchcock did manage to convey the awkwardness of Tracy's presence amongst people who Anny did not want to find out. However, Tracy was hardly the ominous presence such as Bruno Anthony in 'Strangers on a Train' and he was dealt with way too quickly, and it wasn't drawn for a lengthy time period (in the story). Donald Calthrop's performance is easily the best in the film, though you do feel a little sorry for him when the tables are quickly turned. And, I never really understood why Alice thought Franked hadn't figured it out when she confessed, or why Frank had not confronted her about that date. I think some loose ends needed to be tied up.However, 'Blackmail' does have a lot of merit as an example of Britain's first talkie, and as a blueprint for themes, style and technique that Hitchcock would later master. I particularly liked the use of the gloves as plot-point, as well as the painting of the jester becoming symbolic. The climax would also be similarly repeated in Hitchcock's later films. That said, 'Blackmail' is not one of Hitchcock's best films, and is probably more significant because of its early use of sound. 'Blackmail' is not boring, and is easy to watch. Its just there is not much to this film story wise in the end of the day! It's a good movie, but not a great one- and extra credit because Hitchcock manage to turn this film from a silent one into the first British talkie.***½ out of *****!

I'll simply cut to the chase, and say that this movie is a good film. Not amazing, not brilliant, but definitely good.The director, Tim Burton, creates a highly stylised Gothic version of Gotham City, in which crime and deception reign over good and decent moral values. Enter the Batman, alias Bruce Wayne (Micheal Keaton), who will do everything in his power to bring right and justice to the dark and dirty streets of the terrorised metropolis. Encountering the psychopathic criminal-turned-lunatic Joker (Jack Nicholson), and love interest Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger), Batman attempts to save his city from the threat of the Joker's Smilex gas and defeat the clown prince of crime for good.That synopsis, from a comic fan's point-of-view, sounds fantastic, doesn't it? And back in 1989, I doubt anyone had seen anything quite like it. It was the yang to the Superman (1978) yin. Today, however, we are blessed with a more matured sense of super hero film, such as the Spider-Man and X-Men series'. Batman, in retrospective comparison, leaves you with a worrying taste of 'violent camp'. People insist vividly that the film is more adult and took the character and his world more seriously than the 1966 television series, but the film boasts Nicholson prancing around a museum, spray painting over the pictures and Keaton hanging upside down, like a bat, as a form of 'humourous meditation'.Having said that, the acting from the two lead characters is fantastic. Keaton is patchy as a rather hesitant Bruce Wayne, but manages to shift easily into the dark and mysterious Batman persona to give a solid performance. Nicholson is faultless, as he usually is in title roles such as these. Basinger is little more than a scream machine, and manages to pander to the damsel-in-distress role successfully... whilst Micheal Gough (Alfred Pennyworth) and Pat Hingle (Commissioner James Gordon) present an interesting secondary cast, which would be camped up to no end in future sequels. Finally, Robert Wuhl (Alexander Knox) and William Hootkins (Lt. Max Eckhardt) play two of the most vile and uninteresting characters to appear in cinema, playing sleazy and boring '80's cast types that have little to no relevance to the plot or to the Batman mythos itself (outside possible one off roles). A very varied cast.Accepting the fact that this film revolves around style over substance is the key to enjoying it. Burton may not be able to direct Sam Hamm's uninteresting and unquotable script that well (Nicholson uses his incredibly performance to create the most memorable quotes), he does deliver an amazing work of architecture in the form of the amazing set-built Gotham City, and Danny Elfman gives the film a most amazing and awe inspiring score.In conclusion, worth seeing at least once, but unless you're a fan of Tim Burton or Jack Nicholson, it's probably better to rent, rather than buy.

","genre":"Action, Adventure"},{"date":"12 October 2004","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I won't labour on about the obvious facts, such as I'm a huge Batfan or This is the first time Batman was put on the screen since the campy '60's show, as you are all probably aware of that. I'll simply cut to the chase, and say that this movie is a good film. Not amazing, not brilliant, but definitely good.The director, Tim Burton, creates a highly stylised Gothic version of Gotham City, in which crime and deception reign over good and decent moral values. Enter the Batman, alias Bruce Wayne (Micheal Keaton), who will do everything in his power to bring right and justice to the dark and dirty streets of the terrorised metropolis. Encountering the psychopathic criminal-turned-lunatic Joker (Jack Nicholson), and love interest Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger), Batman attempts to save his city from the threat of the Joker's Smilex gas and defeat the clown prince of crime for good.That synopsis, from a comic fan's point-of-view, sounds fantastic, doesn't it? And back in 1989, I doubt anyone had seen anything quite like it. It was the yang to the Superman (1978) yin. Today, however, we are blessed with a more matured sense of super hero film, such as the Spider-Man and X-Men series'. Batman, in retrospective comparison, leaves you with a worrying taste of 'violent camp'. People insist vividly that the film is more adult and took the character and his world more seriously than the 1966 television series, but the film boasts Nicholson prancing around a museum, spray painting over the pictures and Keaton hanging upside down, like a bat, as a form of 'humourous meditation'.Having said that, the acting from the two lead characters is fantastic. Keaton is patchy as a rather hesitant Bruce Wayne, but manages to shift easily into the dark and mysterious Batman persona to give a solid performance. Nicholson is faultless, as he usually is in title roles such as these. Basinger is little more than a scream machine, and manages to pander to the damsel-in-distress role successfully... whilst Micheal Gough (Alfred Pennyworth) and Pat Hingle (Commissioner James Gordon) present an interesting secondary cast, which would be camped up to no end in future sequels. Finally, Robert Wuhl (Alexander Knox) and William Hootkins (Lt. Max Eckhardt) play two of the most vile and uninteresting characters to appear in cinema, playing sleazy and boring '80's cast types that have little to no relevance to the plot or to the Batman mythos itself (outside possible one off roles). A very varied cast.Accepting the fact that this film revolves around style over substance is the key to enjoying it.

My theory is that the character covered less ground than the other two and had more screen time. The immediate sequels to both Dracula and Frankenstein explored entirely new ground &#150; Dracula's Daughter proved an entirely different character than her father, and Bride of Frankenstein advanced the monster to the next evolutionary development while creating yet another beast (beauty?). At the second sequel for Drac and Frank, we hit retread territory, and the third\/forth sequel gets the monster-mash treatment (House of Dracula\/Frankenstein). Wolfman throws a party with Frankenstein upon his second outing.From the midpoint of original Wolf Man through all of the films involving the lycanthrope, Larry Talbot has a relentlessly monotonous 'cure me or kill me' attitude. I find myself begging with him, 'Cure him or kill him. Please!' Or at least write a new and original step for the poor guy to take. In Frankenstein meets the Wolf Man, Talbot starts out dead and winds up (presumably) dead. No revelations, no significant landmarks in his journey, just a simple retread of both Wolf Man and Frankenstein material. So, now really, what was the point? We've robbed the first Wolf Man movie of its power to go from point A to . . . a less definitive point A? To make matters worse, Chaney is in center frame in nearly every frame doing what little he can do to hold up the less-than-adequate writing, or in other words we're forced to watch more of Chaney and get tired of him quicker. I find this a particularly sad case considering my affinity for wolves and wolf-related material. I thought of all the horror classics, the Lycanthrope would prove my favorite. As was the case with Chaney in the role of Dracula (Son of Dracula), I didn't really care for Lugosi in the role of Frankenstein for this movie. Even under the makeup, the magic of original creation is lost to someone striving for imitation. Lugosi was a very gifted and capable actor (with a distinctive accent too); even his bit parts I found instantly recognizable and memorable (long live Ygor!) Unfortunately, playing 'the monster' in Frankenstein meets the Wolfman, Lugosi is just a shadow of Karloff.At least the rich lighting, the elaborate sets, and the virtuoso music still proved up to par with the first Wolf Man picture. I particularly liked the solo violin that occurred throughout the score usually around the gypsies. It kinda makes things a bit sadder since the technical know-how clearly shines through the poor monotonous writing, even more sadly penned by the same author as the original Wolf Man. They say when a franchise runs out of steam a gimmick will come into play in a vain attempt to keep it running. Such is the case today with Freddy versus Jason, such was the case 70 years ago with even the great horror classics.

Chaney and his lycanthropic creation fall into third place as far as both films and creatures go. I liked Chaney the first time I saw him as Larry Talbot (which, unfortunately, was not this film). I liked his sympathetic eyes and seemingly unending expression of sadness (especially after the werewolf curse kicks in); it made for a very likable character until, that is, we hear him whine across four films without evolving one bit. Let the man die and rest in peace. Seeing the films out of order did hurt my viewing of this film. I feel if this were my first glimpse of Talbot, I'd of liked him better, and altogether liked the movie better. Anyway, I did enjoy seeing another side of Larry before the lycanthropy curse got a hold of him, before the unending monologues of not wanting to go through the transformation again, before he went on and on about being a killer with no one ever believing him, you get the idea.I probably would have appreciated the transformations much more had I not already been exposed to the number of repeat scenes (which improved and perfected the technique) in the sequels. I will say the multiple dissolves in rapid succession was inspiring the first time I saw it in action in House of Dracula. Again, I imagine my reaction to this film would have been more positive had I seen it first. The sequels and spin-offs, unfortunately, literally milked the original for all it was worth, and when everything is said and done, there's not much left to go back to.Still, I found enough reasons to keep watching. The tangent with the silver-tipped cane proved interesting, the poem (though overdone) was a nice touch, the pentagram-in-the-next-victim's-palm I found probably the most memorable and effective, Lugosi gave a wonderful cameo, the supporting cast was pretty strong, and the score was surprisingly good.I wish I had caught The Wolf Man before House of Dracula and House of Frankenstein.

The story of ANakin as a little boy with a retarded Jamican sounding side kick...just..well..sucks! The only thing that saves the movie is the last 40 minutes or so. The fight with the Gungans look cool, but YOU DON'T SEE ANY OF THEM DIE!. There are some dead ones in the background if your looking really hard for them. At least in Jedi, you see an Ewok by the farm. The fighter scene with Anakin, was pretty bad until he blew up the control ship by accident. The best character (qui-gon) gets killed off and that's the only emotional link the audience has to the movie. Did I mention how the pod race is fun the first time you see it, but after that you skip to the chapter on the DVD where darth maul almost runs over Anakin.

Then again,I have no doubt that THE EXTERMINATOR also spurred the obviously much better and more successful FIRST BLOOD. Michael Winner doesn't make movies anymore, he is a restaurant critic. Draw your own conclusion. HintWinner takes fall. Cannon Group fodder.You have to love the cut-rate approach that a film like THE EXTERMINATOR takes. Here you have an opening shot that I swear could parody the one in APOCALYPSE NOW if this movie didn't use it to serve it's genre hook. Since the opening setting is in Vietnam,you need it to be at night to veil the sound stage, you also need little palm trees, an interrogation scene that can be used later for inducing cold sweats and flashbacks and of course, last but not least you got your squad running to the ubiquitous Huey taking fire. Flashforward a decade and you have your protagonist alive and well with his 'Nam buddy who literally saved his head. They work at a meat packing plant which will come in handy for the man they pushed too far. Afterall,he fought in the Far East and his name is John Eastland. Apparently,the detective (Christopher George)is the only one who picks up on that kind of karma. To play the main character,you have Robert Ginty who played a 'Nam buddy in COMING HOME.

I was expecting it to be something along the lines of ED TV. I didn't know that it was more of a drama film with some comedy mixed in. I liked this movie. I liked it a lot. It is about a man named Truman, and ever since Truman was born, he has been on television. No, he wasn't a child actor, no it was not some kind of reality TV series. There was a television world created all for him, but all his life he was made to think that it was the real world.

I was expecting it to be something along the lines of ED TV. I didn't know that it was more of a drama film with some comedy mixed in. I liked this movie. I liked it a lot. It is about a man named Truman, and ever since Truman was born, he has been on television. No, he wasn't a child actor, no it was not some kind of reality TV series. There was a television world created all for him, but all his life he was made to think that it was the real world.

Starring the divine Divine, the film explores the outer limits of sick humor. Divine and her brewd compete with another family to see who is the filthiest person alive. Have a guess at who'll win that one!?John Waters' early camp films are not for the average viewer. You must appreciate this man's form of art, but it definitely IS art! Later films like Hairspray, Cry Baby are geared at a main stream audience, for which the filmmaker had to tone it down considerably. For the College Camp Scene though, there is no substitute for the original 70's camp mastrpieces.For anyone who is a John Waters virgin and would like a recommendation for the next project, I suggest Female Trouble . There's so much more to John Waters' vision, realized through his muse Divine. The visually stunning, grotesquely overweight transvestite is quite credible as Dawn Davenport, the high schooler who burned her small-town bridges when she didn't get her cha-cha heels for Christmas in Female Trouble. There are many scenes that are definitely not for the squeamish, highlighted by the moment where Dawn gives birth (alone) and bites the ambilical cord (like primates would do), then, without losing a beat, gets up to confront the newborn's father via a pay phone.If Pink Flamingos entertained you without giving your stomach a turn-over, then you can handle anything delivered by the creative genius John Waters. As all directors, Waters has had a few duds, even if they were box office successes. Avoid the made-up-as-they-go Pecker, a total waste of time. The musically sparcling Cry Baby was trashed by critics, but the sound track makes up plenty for a lousy script. The one to beat is the 1988 Hairspray, Divine's swan song. Pink Flamingos is the ONE that started it all and put Waters on the cult-city map of the world! Just to be safe, have the movie first -- then the dinner!
