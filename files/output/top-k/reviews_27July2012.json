But like all human beings, there's always the possibility of messing up. This film in particular is not one of his greatest films. Somehow I just couldn't latch on to the characters that were involved with the plot. There was no charm with these actors.Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) wants to join the Starship Troopers so he can become a citizen for his planet. And in this world, it is the only way one can become a citizen. The same goes for the characters of Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Jake Busey, and Neil Patrick Harris. That's fine and all that they have a main goal but the way they're persuaded to do it is another story. The new Earth is much weirder than you would expect.Each time the audience is placed in front of a screen, they are blasted with infomercials that deal with becoming a citizen by joining the Starship Troopers. Not to mention, even when the screen is speaking of death and showing the deaths to the public, the narrator still sounds happy. What is this? Are the authorities seriously trying to pull the wool over their eyes? Why does this seem like a dictatorship? Plus, these actors' characters follow these instructions like drones. Like it's no big deal that they're sacrificing their lives for the sake of the federation.The point of joining the military is to defend Earth of a Bug invasion. These bug creatures are really not what you would think of as a bug on earth but they are cool looking. They look like giant camouflage colored toothpick creatures that hunt in giant packs. There are a few other different bug aliens but the majority of them look all the same. And like any Verhoeven movie, the film displays the most atrocious gory death scenes. The ground was almost as wet as the floor in Dead Alive (1992); I couldn't believe the scenes I saw.Besides this though I could not find anything else to enjoy about it. The characters had no personalities and the acting was bland. It's not to say it wasn't good acting because they were obviously following the script but it wasn't fun; everyone acted the same. Basil Poledouris who made several scores to Verhoeven's movies didn't seem to really put anything into this one either. Nothing was fun with it either. That disappointed me too. Just the creature effects and bloodshed were the only standouts.For a science fiction film, it definitely gives the audience the creatures they want. However the acting, music and storyboard are so weird and bland that the bugs will be the only thing worth watching.

I'll admit I've actually had several instances where I thought that my dreams were actually the real world and then when I woke up I was confused if I really woke up to reality or if I'm still dreaming. This film is one of my personal favorite sci-fi movies everything about it is just great let alone the fact it's based on one of the short stories from my favorite sci-fi author Philp K. Dick.Everything about the film is just great from the production value, everything is practical from make up to set pieces there is very little CGI and when the CGI is used it looks great because it looks real. This film to me is one of the best examples of effects and CGI used the right way, well and for the right reasons. One favorite effect of mine is the Robot mask sequence, the mask was practically a three dimensional puzzle, I love how we see it come apart and put itself together. But most importantly I just love the world of the future created because it feels possible and plausible, some concepts are slightly prolific on what we have now. Like the concept that we've been able to colonize planets and are able to travel to them as an everyday convenience. But also the technology mainly the Recall machine which is an interesting and fascinating concept because it's the ability and freedom to create memories and identity anyway you want, let's say I decided my memory vacation would be New York City and I gave myself the identity role of a superhero Batman and I was in some ongoing situation and kicking butt, I would really believe I was Batman at that point in time because that dream vacation is part of my memories. The action sequences are great their all well choreographed and practical plenty of gore effects, like one of my favorite shootouts was in the alien plant and Quaid was using the hologram as a decoy, it was great because even I was fooled sometimes let alone it's sort of acts as an irony to the theme of the film. But also the infamous scene of seeing both Melina and Lori fight, it was a short fight but still it was fun because of just how well choreographed and slightly realistic it was and just the fact two strong hot women were fighting is a turn on for me (seriously I don't know why it just is). The music score is great by one of my favorite composers the late great Jerry Goldsmith, the theme song is one of my favorite themes ever it's an adventurous epic tone.And the characters are great. To me Douglas Quaid is my favorite role from Arnold Schwarznagger. Not just do we like the character Quaid because he can kick butt and has charisma, but that he's actually sympathetic. Throughout the film you see him just completely disoriented with everything happening around him and is struggling to make sense of it but is unable to because there are so many twists and turns and nothing to nobody is what it seems. One moment where I really sympathize with him was in getting jumped by spies and suddenly he starts fighting and killing the guys, after the battle is over he looks at his hands in shock over what he's done. You can clearly see in his eyes he's thinking the same thing we are, how in the hell did he do that. I like Melina (Rachel Ticotin) she's like the common femme fatale in thrillers one to help the hero and fall in love with, she's hot and has the persona and fighting skills to boot. Even the villains are great other than Lori (Sharron Stone) whom was great as the typical deceptive dangerous femme fatale to foil the protagonist. Cohagen (Ronny Cox) whom is a ruthless CEO that rules Mars with an iron fist as well as make big profits at the cost of lives. But to me the villain that stands out is Richter played well by one of my favorite actors Michael Ironside, he's just a right hand man that is just so ruthless and hell bent on wanting to kill Quaid for no apparent reason it just seems like he hates his guts, may'be both had some bad blood in the past I don't know. He's menacing because of his unbending determination to kill him, he's willing to kill anyone in the way if it means he has a clear shot. He's kinda fun\/funny because there is this really black sense of charisma or dry humor to his character.It tackles the existential philosophical concepts on what is reality as well as what is identity. It really is trippy when you think about it, whenever you wake up everything is always the same except the day which always changes and with every tomorrow we always add more to our identity or discover things about ourselves we didn't think existed. And how much about our past can we really remember, there are times when there is conflicting viewpoints on how we remember certain event of our life, another at that event may remember and viewed it differently, or it just didn't happen at all.So are we in reality or dreaming, it's really up to you.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"27 July 2012","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Dreams and reality are always in conflict because the line gets blurred so easily and there isn't a real way to be sure.

So they put the mask on you play a commercial you have a seizure and bugs eat your face. Plus all of the factory workers are robots. This sounds like bad cartoon and basically this is what it is. Its a family guy episode in real life, its comical at some points especially when tom decides hes going to sleep with the female lead. The question is simple where do you want to sleep? that's a stupid question miss whatever the girls name is.

Let's try to visualize the movie OK you got it in your head now take Halloween off of the title and just call it season of the witch. Now does it make the movie any better? No OK i didn't think so. John carpenter tried to do something different and i will give him the credit for that. But lets break this piece of garbage down.

She's created a special serum that will have women giving birth to the creatures and soon they will take over everything. CARNOSAUR was producer Roger Corman's attempt to cash-in on Steven Spielberg's JURASSIC PARK, which would be released later in the year. It's pretty funny that Corman was able to get this thing a theatrical release but sadly the movie doesn't live up to much because it's just a tad bit too mainstream for its own good. Overall the film does manage to get a good feel of those 1950s monster movies where there's really not much of a story and instead of one we just get a monster running around killing people. This is actually one thing that works with the picture and I think another good thing is that the filmmakers never take the subject or story overly serious. This works for a number of reasons but the biggest is that star Ladd takes the material so serious that you can't help but be entertained by her maniac style performance. I liked the fact that she was so serious in the movie simply because it adds a level of entertainment that you wouldn't have had had the actress simply shown up to cash a check. Obviously the special effects weren't going to be on the level of the Spielberg film but for the most part I thought they were good. Yes, it's obvious these things aren't real but that really doesn't hurt the film as they're at least entertaining for what they are. I think what hurts the film is the fact that it's a tad bit too pretty for its own good. With the Spielberg movie being what it is, usually these rip-offs try to just be exploitation 101 and CARNOSAUR really doesn't reach that level. The usually seen nudity isn't anywhere to be found and the death scenes are pretty lifeless and uninteresting. A film like this really needed to deliver for its lack of effects and story but instead we're just given a watered down version of a horror movie.

Truth be told, this is one of the worst movies ever made, and that is why you absolutely must see it. It is more unintentionally funny than most actual comedies, and it provides as much entertainment value by accident as lots of movies do on purpose. It is like a train wreck, but with this wreck, the passengers are all slipping on banana peels as they exit the train.Here is what I think happened &#x96; the producers decided that they wanted to cash in on the franchise one more time, so they decided to bring back Mr. Miyagi and Daniel for one last hurrah. The script writers cooked up another story about Daniel fighting the Cobra Kais, getting beaten up, competing in the karate tournament once again, and then winning in the end. Then Ralph Macchio showed up for day 1 pudgy and out of shape, and panic erupted. Quickly, the script was rewritten with all of Daniel's fight scenes taken out, and the tournament rules changed so that all Daniel had to do to defend his title was show up for the last fight. I find it next to impossible that anyone associated with this movie honestly expected the audience to buy this, but they were far enough into the project that they had no choice but to finish it.So what do we get? We get an hour and a half of poor Danny getting abused over and over again. He's chubby. He's pushing 30, but he is still 17 in the movie and he sounds like he is about 13. He gets punched. He gets taunted. He gets kicked in the balls. His, uh, girlfriend gets harassed and almost assaulted as some bullies trash Mr. Miyagi's shop, but Mr. Miyagi does absolutely nothing but push the bullies out the door. At no point, does it cross anyone's mind to call the cops. At some point, we start sympathizing more with the bullies than Daniel. He is such a wimp with no defensive instincts, and at this point, Mr. Miyagi seems like an insensitive dope because he makes Daniel get beaten to a pulp multiple times before he will finally agree to train him.You can tell that just about everybody acting in this movie knows that it's a stinker, so why bother trying? Ralph Macchio totally phones in his performance, and so does Pat Morita (Miyagi). The minor actors in the movie, like Thomas Ian Griffith (the evil pony tail guy) and Martin Kove (the big evil trainer from the first movie) seem to get the joke here. They play over the top, exaggerated cartoon villains, whose only function is to be pointlessly mean. They are grown men, but their lives revolve around torturing a 17 year old boy as revenge for winning a karate tournament. At the end, Daniel finally faces down the big bully. Only this time, he doesn't try to throw any punches or block anything. He just stands there like a doughboy punching bag, yelping out in pain with his girly voice. I have always thought that the greatest achievement of the first two movies was that they made Daniel's triumphs believable and convincing. Since Mr. Miyagi focused on defense and maintaining a positive attitude, Daniel could survive a fight against a privileged bully and a brutal Okinawan street fighter who did not have this kind of positive influence. But in this one, it's just a massive beating. It is just so hard to take seriously that you get a sadistic pleasure out of it, kind of like watching somebody get hammered with a 2X4 in a Bugs Bunny cartoon.Maybe the worst thing about this movie is that deep down, somewhere buried underneath the terrible acting and the awful script, there were some good ideas here. A Vietnam vet befriending Daniel and teaching him the darker side of martial arts &#x96; sounds like a story with a lot of potential. Maybe the world isn't inherently a good place. Maybe life has predators and prey, and maybe a Vietnam vet is an appropriate guy to teach that to Daniel, who up to this point is still pretty naïve. Maybe a movie that questioned the idealism of the first two and dug into some gray areas could have been really good. But, nope! We just got a tired rehash of the lessons from the first two movies, but they don't even seem to make sense here. Our Vietnam vet is actually just a villain &#x96; so cartoony that he even goes around a corner for a sneaky evil laugh while he listens to Daniel punch a piece of wood. Ouch! This one shows up on cable somewhere every once in a while, and if you can catch it, I highly recommend it.

For a movie so hyped, so anticipated by a whole generation of people I at least expected it to be entertaining and some-what good. But no, Georgle Lucas just had to take a masterpiece and crap all over it and produce the Phantom Menace.We all know that the prequel saga is all about Anakin Skywalker becoming Darth Vader and betraying the jedi. But this movie barely touched on that subject at all. Instead it focused on a boring trade dispute that achieved no emotional reaction from the audience (they could have at least showed some Nabooians struggling in poverty not being able to get supplies or something), boring political issues and a villain that we don't really know the motive of.The character of Qui-gon Jinn was the only relatable character in the film. He was the guy who saved the queen and freed the kid from slavery and we were all sitting there thinking 'wow, Qui-gon's the man!' all while Obi-wan twiddles his thumbs and occasionally had a dull throw away line. Obi-wan did survive this film and as such should have had a more important role to try and get the audience actually caring about what happens to him.Anakin was just a kid they found on Tattoine who we were supposed to believe was special in some way. He never really displayed any extraordinary ability other than a proficiency with machanics and good reflexes (which nearly every character in the movie had). The pod-race was cool however although drawn out and the scene where he leaves his mother was one of the few times throughout the entire film where any character showed emotion. But I was extremely disappointed that we couldn't see Anakin and Obi- wan really bond. Or maybe just not like each other at first and develop a friendship. We're told in all the other movies that Anakin and Obi-wan are hte best of friends but we never really see how that came about. And an 8 year old kid falling in love with a 14 year old queen. PUH-LEASE, at least a teenage Anakin would be relatable to the audience. But no. They went with an 8 year old. The Jedi council scenes and the senate scenes were just so dull I could barely stand it. The council could spposedly see a darkness in Anakin, but we were just meant to take their word on it, we never see anything foreshadowing Skywalker's transformation into Vader. In the meanwhile Palpatine is just shown trying to gain more and more power from the senate, and that was all political mumjo jumbo that had all the kids watching running off to play with their toys or something.Darth Maul was a character I thought had loads of potential but GL again gave him about 3 lines in the whole movie and we never get a motive for his actions. It's just he's working with Sidious and he hates Jedi. Deal with it. His death at the end of the film irritated me too. If Maul had survived I would have been far more interested in the sequel. Obi-wan had just seen his master killed by this Sith, in a scene I give props to as being truly epic, but, he would be angry, upset and emotional. Something that he didn't display much of throughout the movie. It would have led on to maybe some great battles between them in the future and given me a cliff-hanger that excited me for what was to come. Much like GL did with Empire.Finally, I couldn't understand the tone of the movie at all. IN the scenes that were supposed to be dramatic, Jar Jar wold come alone and do something stupid to try and get a laugh from the audience. It totally ruined the mood because I'd get all nervous about one thing, next minute I'm watching Jar Jar juggle electric balls in the middle of a battle. It just didn't fit.

But this movie barely touched on that subject at all. Instead it focused on a boring trade dispute that achieved no emotional reaction from the audience (they could have at least showed some Nabooians struggling in poverty not being able to get supplies or something), boring political issues and a villain that we don't really know the motive of.The character of Qui-gon Jinn was the only relatable character in the film. He was the guy who saved the queen and freed the kid from slavery and we were all sitting there thinking 'wow, Qui-gon's the man!' all while Obi-wan twiddles his thumbs and occasionally had a dull throw away line. Obi-wan did survive this film and as such should have had a more important role to try and get the audience actually caring about what happens to him.Anakin was just a kid they found on Tattoine who we were supposed to believe was special in some way. He never really displayed any extraordinary ability other than a proficiency with machanics and good reflexes (which nearly every character in the movie had). The pod-race was cool however although drawn out and the scene where he leaves his mother was one of the few times throughout the entire film where any character showed emotion. But I was extremely disappointed that we couldn't see Anakin and Obi- wan really bond. Or maybe just not like each other at first and develop a friendship. We're told in all the other movies that Anakin and Obi-wan are hte best of friends but we never really see how that came about. And an 8 year old kid falling in love with a 14 year old queen. PUH-LEASE, at least a teenage Anakin would be relatable to the audience. But no. They went with an 8 year old. The Jedi council scenes and the senate scenes were just so dull I could barely stand it. The council could spposedly see a darkness in Anakin, but we were just meant to take their word on it, we never see anything foreshadowing Skywalker's transformation into Vader. In the meanwhile Palpatine is just shown trying to gain more and more power from the senate, and that was all political mumjo jumbo that had all the kids watching running off to play with their toys or something.Darth Maul was a character I thought had loads of potential but GL again gave him about 3 lines in the whole movie and we never get a motive for his actions. It's just he's working with Sidious and he hates Jedi. Deal with it. His death at the end of the film irritated me too. If Maul had survived I would have been far more interested in the sequel. Obi-wan had just seen his master killed by this Sith, in a scene I give props to as being truly epic, but, he would be angry, upset and emotional. Something that he didn't display much of throughout the movie. It would have led on to maybe some great battles between them in the future and given me a cliff-hanger that excited me for what was to come. Much like GL did with Empire.Finally, I couldn't understand the tone of the movie at all. IN the scenes that were supposed to be dramatic, Jar Jar wold come alone and do something stupid to try and get a laugh from the audience. It totally ruined the mood because I'd get all nervous about one thing, next minute I'm watching Jar Jar juggle electric balls in the middle of a battle. It just didn't fit. There were only 3 good things I could take from the picture. - special effects - The music - a few decent scenes like the pod race or the lightsaber battle at the end.But overall I was extremely disappointed with TPM. I prefer to pretend it never happened and Star Wars is just a trilogy.

This isn't a knock against the film--just a knock at how it was marketed. I think you should be prepared for the type of film you are about to see.Funny Bones begins with some sort of deal going bad on the water off of Blackpool, England. One man is chopped up by the blades of a boat and another is forced to jump into the water to save himself. What exactly happened and why is a complete mystery and bits and pieces of this are interspersed throughout the film.The film then very abruptly changes to Las Vegas. A terribly unfunny man, Tommy Fawkes (Oliver Platt), is about to make his big debut at one of the big clubs. Not surprisingly, he bombs--and folks start walking out during his act. Now this happens from time to time...but what makes it different is that the guy is the son of a legendary comedian, George Fawkes (Jerry Lewis). It's obviously difficult living in your father's shadow--especially when you aren't talented. Soon Tommy disappears--and ends up in Blackpool to see if he can buy an act for himself. Now he knows he is terrible at telling jokes--so he wants to see if he can learn physical comedy. During this process, he accidentally bumps into some folks who have a dark connection to his dad--and learns several terrible secrets about his old man. I could say a lot more, but it would spoil the film.In addition to the main plot discussed above, the plot begun at the start of the film seemed a bit dark, confusing and unnecessary--and not especially well integrated into the rest of the movie. It seemed to have VERY little to do with the Fawkes story and was choppy and seemed to get in the way of the main story--which was very compelling as I found myself wanting to see more interaction between Platt and Lewis. I also enjoyed was seeing some of the strange burlesque-style acts. Some were very funny and some were just cool. This was a nice little homage to the English acts which used to be big in Blackpool.

After some months, she suggests to love, we invited to watch the nearly nine film minutes. When they part, she weeps. Until this moment he was an adult, polite behavior and tender attitude. Roger Eberts You are not in love with the other person, so much as the two of you share a tenderness because each knows how hard the other has looked, and how hopeless the search seemed at times. But after their public-lovemaking he changes into the boyish stubborn attitude, paired with its latent male brutality. Against the deal, he follows her without her knowledge &#x96; or does she? &#x96; loosing her in the métrolabyrint. Even she is nervous, sensing that he, against their deal, needs not her but her as 'Mother'. The idea of the restaurant dinner did not belong to their deal. A new deal should have been made as the deal was for them the lacanian Third, forbidding the mother-child-incest. She accepted the dinner, admitting for the interviewer What was it? One sentence, two? Words he said, those few, started off everything. But I didn't understand that then. A deal helps the male to be the adult, but changes him into a boy when the deal is not taken seriously, not changed when the contents changes. The event with the old man is the result of the deals disintegration. She looses her self by trying to rescue the relation. She suddenly believes that she loves him, telling him that she wants to share their aging life together. Now it is his turn for his tears. Unable to answer, they return to the hotel, having a bath and seeing them after having made love For one second, he tells her you gave me everything. (this moment is the cover picture of the VHS\/DVD). Their last time in the café we hear their thoughts &#x96; he translating her body language different. The affair has to end as their years experience is not enough for a every-day-relation. For a last time they return to room Ne 118 to enact what the deal was, closing the circle, sealing the together-year as a memory-jewel. Departing, they briefly kiss goodbye and dissolve into the blurred crowd. It is in todays big-brother-is-watching-you-society easy to find the other &#x96; they never did that. Are they now tempted to use the off screen interviewers knowledge, aware of that their fantasy still tempts? As long we live with the wish of smoking, even that we have stopped, we still smoke.

Being a boy, into war games and sci-fi, it is perhaps no surprise that I loved it and went to see it about five times at the movies (no small achievement when you're a kid with hardly any money). At the time it was to me, the perfect movie. It had a great storyline, non-stop action, humor and incredible special effects. The love interest stuff went over my head of course.Fast forward to today - July 2012. I am much older, and hopefully (?) much wiser. I've seen loads and loads of films since Independence Day. My tastes have become more sophisticated and I know much more about how films are made and why they made in the way they are. I've also become much more cynical about movies - unfortunately - and I guess that is somewhat inevitable with age.Independence Day was on TV the other night and I thought 'what the hell - I'll watch it again.' I was a bit wary of doing this because I was fairly sure that I would hate it. I would be embarrassed that I liked it as a 14 year old. This has already happened to me with other movies I've watched as an adult that I loved as a child. But I loved this movie so much that I wanted to give it a chance. Maybe at 29 I would still enjoy it as I did 15 years ago.By the time I had finished watching it I felt like I was 14 again. I was optimistic and hopeful about the human race - again. Screw the Global Financial Crisis - we can beat it! Yeah climate change is a big worry - but we can beat that too! Yeah! And I'm not joking either. I felt so good after watching this movie that it felt like I'd been injected with a shot with Anthony Robbin's personality.How does a popcorn flick like Independence Day do this? Yes, I liked the humor, especially Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsh. Yes the special effects stand up pretty well. The pacing is pretty much perfect. The script isn't amazing but there is some good dialogue in there. Even the president's speech wasn't as corny as I remember.The reason I think Independence Day is such a great movie is that it is imbued with a sense of optimism about mankind. I don't think it's forced either. Movies are a reflection on the politics and history they are produced in. Independence Day was made in 1996, a time where the world was generally at peace and hopeful and optimistic about the future. It is hard not to get carried along with the confidence and optimism in Independence Day. My cynic turned off after about 30 minutes and by the end I was cheering along with everyone else. Maybe harder. It feels like it's been so long since there has been any news in the world to be positive about.In 2012 the world has changed a lot from 1996. America is no longer the superpower it was then. 9\/11 and terrorism still cast a shadow. Most of the world is in recession. Climate change is becoming a reality. Some think it could get worse. There isn't a great sense of optimism at the moment. Watching Independence Day again renewed my hope in mankind, like many great movies do. The cynic in me wanted to laugh at the idea of the world uniting together, mock the idea of Israelis and Syrians fighting side by side, and ridicule out of a crop duster pilot giving up his life to take out a city sized alien space ship. But the 14 year old inside me won out - that idealism and optimism was still there - thankfully. I can't wait until movies like this are made again. That will mean that we are again moving forward with a sense of optimism and confidence about the future. And Hollywood movies will begin to reflect that. Maybe we will work out how to beat climate change. Or maybe the world economy will start booming again. There is a lot to look forward to.

Many of them accused Stealing Beauty in what they called apparent self-indulgence, and lack of character development and drama. I don't care about self-indulgence if it helps to create as beautiful and pleasing to all senses film as Stealing Beauty. And if the critics did not feel sweet gentle sadness from encountering the stealing beauty that one can't hold on to forever, I feel sorry for them.I re-watched the film recently and I loved it even more than first time. It has got some healing quality to it, it glows under Tuscany sun. It is filled with warmth, longing and bitter-sweetness.This must be one of my favorite movies about coming of age, about unforgettable moment in time that changes life of a young person forever and touches lives of all people around her. In the center of the film, there is Lucy, a 19 years old American girl, who came to Italy to spend the summer with the group of artists - friends of her mother while trying to come to terms with her mother's recent suicide and the secrets that she took with her. Lucy will learn more about people she thought she knew well and about herself. She will change forever during the unforgettable summer in Tuscany.Stealing Beauty is a European film in the best sense of the word. Leisurely paced, gorgeously shot, it looks in the faces of characters, in the beauty surrounding them, with interest and affection. This is a lovely film that celebrates life and beauty of youth, nature and Italy, Art and power of memory. This film reminds me another favorite of mine, Enchanting April (1992). Perhaps, because both movies have the same atmosphere, the similar scenery, the sun of Tuscany, and their effect on characters, and both are so delightfully and unabashedly romantic.Liv Tyler in her first big role lit the screen with her beauty and, charming awkwardness. She was very convincing as the girl hesitating to step over the border between adolescence and maturity. Lyv Tyler obviously was not an experienced actress at 19 but I don't think it was required of her. Lucy was natural and charming, innocent and curious, she was the center of the film, and her innocence, wholesomeness, insecurity and seriousness touched lives of everyone she spent that summer in Tuscany with. Watching Tyler simply move on screen is a cinematic pleasure. One second, the movements of her endless legs and arms are graceful and fluid, next - she is all angular impetuosity. She knew the effect of her luminous beauty on everyone but she was not quite sure how to deal with it.Besides Liv Tyler in the performance that made her a star, Jeremy Irons is also memorable as Alex Parrish. Stealing Beauty was the last feature film of the multi- talented, famous and beloved French actor, Jean Marais, mostly known for his collaboration with Jean Cocteau, Lucino Visconti and for many excellent film and stage performances.

Come to the cabaret! croons a divine Sally Bowles, the American expatriate living in pre-World War Two decadent Berlin, sleeping around and dancing on stage at the Kit-Kat club, played with great vulnerability and aplomb by Liza Minnelli. Partnered with Joel Grey's astonishing turn as the Master of Ceremonies, the two shine in Bob Fosse's remarkable musical Cabaret, a film that foregrounds the messy, tumultuous relationships among Sally, her next door neighbor and lover, the very British Brian Roberts (Michael York), a charismatic German businessman Baron Maximilian (Helmut Griem) with his laissez faire political and sexual interests, and another couple, one Jewish, one not. Ultimately, the film foretells the growing crucible of Berlin with its boots and swastikas, its fear and violence, by focusing on the lives of these men and women in a time of growing crisis. Liza Minnelli carries the film with a performance of great humanity and grace. Her expressive eyes do so much work in the many close-up shots that Fosse employs; her singing and choreography are both stunningly original and remarkably human. She lives, breathes, performs like a performer, and despite the role's manic-pixie-dream-girl template, Minnelli plumbs the depths of Sally's misery and anxiousness her anger at her absent father, her ardent desire for fame, her unflappable determination to be the life of the party. A favorite scene involves Sally Bowles trying to contain herself while in the presence of another beautiful woman, and the gestures and frustration boil over in ways that are interesting and true. Minelli's Sally Bowles is a sad character, one of intelligence and passion, and one that I fear for in the ramp-up to the Third Reich. Perhaps, Sally's character lacks some of the naiveté or hollowness that Fosse intends by casting her with the dynamic Liza Minnelli (In fact, I had a difficult time figuring out how anyone would not be captivated by Sally, not take her to Hollywood, not make her a star!). Simply put, the film would not work without Minnelli's tour de force performance of singing, dancing, and embodying the weakness and the strength of Sally Bowles, the American who has lost her way in a darkening city. In addition to riveting dance numbers and filming everything with medium shots or close-ups which give great focus on the eyes, make-up, and lips of characters, director Bob Fosse stages tableau shots which give us snapshots of the time the beaten Kit-Kat club owner, bloodied by Nazi boots; a Russian corpse, presumably communist, strewn across a busy street with people looking in horror; an older German man who remains sitting while everyone around him stands in a nationalistic fever singing the song Tomorrow Belongs To Me, in a moment of ominous foreshadowing. Fosse inserts German radio in the background of multiple scenes at Sally and Brian's flat, with the chatter underlining the rise of Nazism and Hitler, along with an elderly German woman stating at one point, I wish we could go back to the days of the Kaiser! And the emcee, Master of Ceremonies, and Greek chorus of Cabaret is the marvelous Joel Grey, an elfin performer with a haunting and childlike whimsy of a performance with wigs, make-up, various costume changes which go from milkmaid to goose stepping soldier, and a charismatic sense of play. The emcee's role, it seems, is to welcome and usher us into the darkness and twisted mirrors of the Kit-Kat club, to entertain us with his commentary and routines, to comment on the chapters of the film itself through song and dance and comedy, as well as to provoke us into considering the role of art in a fascist state, the role of the artist who performs for those he or she may personally abhor. Can you take a Nazi Party member's money as an artist? Should you? In a world where famous musical artists are taken to task for exorbitant birthday party performances such as Beyonce or Mariah Carey's recent events for the late dictator Moammar Gadhafi, the role of the artist when confronted with cruel power is still present with us today. Grey's emcee playfully sings a dazzling array of songs with amazing choreography, and the film lights up every time he appears. Fosse shows restraint and lets dance sequences play out in real-time or at least in long, unbroken takes compared to the frenetic editing of today's films, allowing us to drink in everything that is going on at once on stage, as well as giving the cramped, confined quarters of the Kit-Kat club stage with its mirrors, curtains, and band an intimate feel; the barrier between performer and audience is nearly nonexistent as Grey dips into the audience from time to time for jokes and laughter. Fosse uses shots of the Master's face as jump cuts at other important moments in the film, signifying the performer's role as always commenting on those men and women and their travails, always seeing everything around him in the city as it spirals and spirals. It is an astonishing performance. The Master of Ceremonies adds an elegiac air to the dwindling days of bustling, cosmopolitan Berlin. By all accounts, it was one of the most wonderful cities in the world during this time. The audience slowly changes over the course of the film until the devastating final shot. His songs and dancing then take on the air of a survivalist, a clownish desperate attempt to curry favor and possible reprieve from what is to come. Is there hope? When the SS Storm Troopers come to the Kit-Kat club, and come they will, the Master of Ceremonies and his troupe will have no place in the Third Reich. We know where the Nazis will place them.

Come to the cabaret! croons a divine Sally Bowles, the American expatriate living in pre-World War Two decadent Berlin, sleeping around and dancing on stage at the Kit-Kat club, played with great vulnerability and aplomb by Liza Minnelli. Partnered with Joel Grey's astonishing turn as the Master of Ceremonies, the two shine in Bob Fosse's remarkable musical Cabaret, a film that foregrounds the messy, tumultuous relationships among Sally, her next door neighbor and lover, the very British Brian Roberts (Michael York), a charismatic German businessman Baron Maximilian (Helmut Griem) with his laissez faire political and sexual interests, and another couple, one Jewish, one not. Ultimately, the film foretells the growing crucible of Berlin with its boots and swastikas, its fear and violence, by focusing on the lives of these men and women in a time of growing crisis. Liza Minnelli carries the film with a performance of great humanity and grace. Her expressive eyes do so much work in the many close-up shots that Fosse employs; her singing and choreography are both stunningly original and remarkably human. She lives, breathes, performs like a performer, and despite the role's manic-pixie-dream-girl template, Minnelli plumbs the depths of Sally's misery and anxiousness her anger at her absent father, her ardent desire for fame, her unflappable determination to be the life of the party. A favorite scene involves Sally Bowles trying to contain herself while in the presence of another beautiful woman, and the gestures and frustration boil over in ways that are interesting and true. Minelli's Sally Bowles is a sad character, one of intelligence and passion, and one that I fear for in the ramp-up to the Third Reich. Perhaps, Sally's character lacks some of the naiveté or hollowness that Fosse intends by casting her with the dynamic Liza Minnelli (In fact, I had a difficult time figuring out how anyone would not be captivated by Sally, not take her to Hollywood, not make her a star!).

The case is intriguing and did what seldom movies can do, surprise me. There is an ending to this film that will just completely blow you away. As for the rest of the film, it was extremely entertaining thanks to the outstanding cast, that features both Richard Gere and a very young, Edward Norton, in one of his first roles. At the time Norton was a no-name, while Gere was the big star. Who would have thought that eventually Norton would become the bigger name? Well, anyone who saw this film and the absolutely tremendous performance Norton gives. To be honest, most court room dramas don't surprise me. You can always tell if the suspect is guilty or innocent, and there is usually some kind of twist in the story. Primal Fear was not so cut and dry, I kept going back and fourth on the suspects guilt or innocence myself. That's because this is a powerful movie, with an unrivaled cast, written by a professional novelist, as opposed to some amateur screenwriter.
