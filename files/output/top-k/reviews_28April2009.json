I found great fun in films like The Blob, Tremors and Alien, but I was always searching for a good aquatic monster movie. The ones I did watch disappointed me; some more then others. I'm talking about The Deep, Deepstar six, Deep blue sea, Leviathan and the Sphere. Some might disagree with me on this, but I'm just stating my honest opinion here.Then I came across this movie.I honestly didn't know what to expect. The fact that Famke Jansen played in it made me curious, as I love most movies she plays in. So I decided to give it a shot and popped the sucker into the DVD-player.From start to finish, I was quite surprised. This is a very enjoyable movie! The acting is good. Sure, it could have been better at some parts, but in overall; the characters act like how normal persons would behave in their situation. As I mentioned, Famke Jansen delivers another great performance. The lead, Treat Williams, also plays a great role as the captain of his 'ship'.I especially liked how the story developed. The movie starts a tad slow, but this gives you the chance to learn a bit or two about the characters. This usually helps; although not required in a monster movie. By the time the film really starts, the action doesn't stop.Moving to the CGI effects; I'd have to say it was done pretty nice. The monster(s) move pretty cool and it's not often you see giant aquatic worms devour people whole, right? There's also gore in this film. Not that you drown in it (no pun intended), but there are some gruesome scenes. If you are a gore fan, however, you will find some fun in this movie. There are no flying limbs all the time, but let's just say that this movie has it's fair share of blood and bodies.The only bad thing I can say about this film is the ending, but you have to see it for yourself.So, in overall, this is definitely not a bad movie. In it's genre, I dare to say that it's one of the better movies. If you are a fan of (aquatic) monster movies, I say check it out! You won't be disappointed.

Then again, I watched Alien as a 12-year old, so... yeah.I didn't get all of the details on my first viewing, but it certainly gave me scares and thrills! Like the first movie, the acting, music and story is very good.It's this film that made me a fan of Sigourney Weaver. Her character truly evolves in this movie. Starting out as a traumatized victim of the creature from the first film and ending up as a hard-core, caring mother. No one would mess with her children, that's for sure!

Not on a single spaceship in the middle of nowhere, but rather on a planet, in a complex inhabited by colonists. Well, it USED to be inhabited...You see more of the creatures in this film, compared to Alien. But that's not a bad thing. It works well and they didn't over-use it, like Alien Resurrection.I recommend getting the extended (special) version since it adds more to the story and it has a few extra scenes which add to the film as a whole.

Yes, I love Psycho and Vertigo and the others as well, but N x NW has more dimensions and more intrigue and better pacing than any of his other movies.I've read a few comments here that seem to imply that N x NW is lacking in depth or missing some kind of transcendent meaning. It's only entertainment. That seems unfair. If you want introspection or soul-searching, rent an Ingmar Bergman for heaven's sake! Hitch was always the master of surfaces, the perfect artifice. When an actor once asked What is my motivation in this scene? Hitch replied, your salary. He had no use for heavy-handed meanings and morals, even in his dark fables.Still, N x NW is full of them if you look. The shallow ad-man discovers he's actually an intrepid hero. Truth be told, he's as world-wise as he is world-weary. Can you imagine forgiving and even pursuing a lover who has lied to you so she can send you off to be killed? Who seduced you just following orders? How romantic is that? He eventually realizes he's caught in a terrible game of moral relativity, with everyone out for themselves or their cause, so he might as well join them. It's in the forest reunion, after the fake shooting, where he pronounces judgment on it all If you fellows can't lick the Vandamms of this world without asking girls like her to bed down with them and fly away with them and probably never come back alive, maybe you better start learning to lose a few cold wars! So Thornhill is a mensch after all. Who knew?That's why the earlier scene in Washington at the CIA building is so important, and, contrary to some opinions, needs to be there. That's where you first realize how ruthless the whole Cold War game is. We do&#x85;.nothing, the Professor pronounces, about Thornhill's predicament. C'est la guerre, one of them intones ironically. Goodbye, Mr. Thornhill, wherever you are, says the last. It doesn't ruin the movie for us to discover that Kaplan doesn't exist. We had about 40 minutes of uncertainty. Now it's onto some other intrigue. Hitch gives us plenty. It was a favorite Hitchcock ploy to let the viewer in on a secret that the protagonist didn't know. From that point on, the viewer is subconsciously willing that inside information to him or her, and wondering when and how they will discover it.There are so many ironies in N x NW it's hard to list them all. Maybe the greatest is Vandamm. He seems like the epitome of cool and control and sophistication. Yet he's constantly miscalculating! First he nabs the wrong guy, then he fails to kill him on at least three occasions, in part because of a kinky predilection for exotic homicide like crop-dusting biplanes and drunken convertible driving, (and knife-throwers, if you believe as I do that Vandamm's thug Valerian was actually aiming for Kaplan and missed). How this guy got to the top of his game is a true mystery.But Vandamm's biggest screw-up is loaning out his girlfriend for the night on the train. She's obviously long over him and eager to move on, whether she knows it or not. And Vandamm's even met the intriguing, resourceful hunk he's turning her over to! And he's not worried? Talk about arrogance and vanity! So he loses Eve as well. Still, once Leonard informs on her, he could save his own butt if he just disposed of her in some normal Mafioso kind of way&#x97;like a bullet or something&#x97;but instead he has to fantasize about throwing her out of the plane over the ocean. That gives our hero the extra five minutes he needs to save her. One more irony.So think of Vandamm's dénouement there he is, this suave foreign agent whose gig is undermining our government, busted atop the very icon of Americana, Mt. Rushmore, all his thugs dead, his mistress in love with someone else, and now probably about to be put away for life (and maybe even executed in those paranoid 1950's times), when just a few moments before he was happily sipping champagne in his ultra-modern Frank Lloyd Wright mountain retreat. Talk about reversal of fortune!At least he still has the panache to quip a final one-liner, as his right arm Leonard hurtles over a cliff.

One more irony.So think of Vandamm's dénouement there he is, this suave foreign agent whose gig is undermining our government, busted atop the very icon of Americana, Mt. Rushmore, all his thugs dead, his mistress in love with someone else, and now probably about to be put away for life (and maybe even executed in those paranoid 1950's times), when just a few moments before he was happily sipping champagne in his ultra-modern Frank Lloyd Wright mountain retreat. Talk about reversal of fortune!At least he still has the panache to quip a final one-liner, as his right arm Leonard hurtles over a cliff. That wasn't very sporting, using real bullets.Ernest Lehman's brilliant script and convoluted plot makes this movie one I can watch again and again.

You can't say that it strives very valiantly to be realistic but according to the trivia section on IMDb the movie was heavily researched.One thing that is worth noting is that Quentin Tarantino brought elements to the script and you can almost guess which scenes are his (which German guy was in Run Silent, Run Deep and the whole Silver Surfer argument). Tarantino had previously scripted another Tony Scott film, True Romance and the dialogue is very similar in those few scenes on Crimson Tide.This is also the movie where I found out that there was an actor of Danish ancestry called Viggo Mortensen. Weird, because I have a cousin with the same first name. He does very well with a character who has a life and death situation in his hands. Watch him when Hackman's character puts a gun to his head. It's eerie how cool he can play it. If i had Hackman screaming in my ear, I would flinch just a little bit, even though I knew it was all just a movie.The third notable thing about Crimson Tide is that this is the first time I detested a character who was supposed to be a hero, Denzel Washington's character Lt. Hunter to be exact. Yes, he may be right but there was not a single moment where I was convinced that he could get people on his side to execute a mutiny. He comes off as an arrogant elitist who shields himself behind the rule book. Watch one of the last scenes in the movie and you will absolutely agree that what happens may be in accordance with Navy conduct, but you feel that justice was far from served. Washington's character Lt. Hunter should have had some sort of comeuppance.It all comes down to a boil when Gene Hackman's character is about to take back control of his boat but just out of curiosity decides to see if the crackpot Hunter is right. Hackman also detests Hunter but he can't shake the feeling that he is over the hill and his instincts are failing. Hackman plays it masterfully. His last scene is grace and humility incarnate. He may be a stubborn old goat but he knows when to step down. Too bad, he almost put the World under before he realised it.What more can you say, except that this is worth being seen as more than just an action thriller. Hackman went into a serious slump until he went on to a minor comeback with The Royal Tenenbaums. Washington is the one of the highest regarded actors but I still don't know why. I have seen him in about 10 movies and his characters always make me want to squirm. Odd, because in interviews he seems kind of sympathetic.

It plays out like a miniseries, about a woman who just separated from her writer boyfriend(played by Sam Niel who serves as narrator), and crashes cars with wounded bank-robbers, they offer to give her some of the money if she will transport the cash the rest of the way to Paris for them. She agrees and uses her money to finance the trip that ensues for the rest of the movie. She immediately after meets William Hurt, a mysterious hitchhiker she becomes fascinated with. He is on the lamb, but from who, and why? After he ditches her and steals a hefty sum she becomes obsessed with finding him.All the while a rouge Indian nuclear satellite hovers above the Earth, haywire and endangering a possible nuclear Apocalypse if it accidentally detonates. The world is closer to ending than it has ever been, which means its just a story on the news in the background, most people try to ignore.The first segment, in this three part film, is their chase cross country and continent, A Dance Around The World, as the book about their lives is latter called.They begin in Italy, and go on to Paris, Berlin, Moscow, Bejing, Tokyo, San Francisco, and finally the Australlian Outback, our heroin Miriam discovers, that Hurt is wanted for a stolen piece of Government property, a device that records the experience of seeing and translates the information as images. He is recording the most beautiful places in the world, for his blind mother. He is the son of Max Von Sydow, the inventor of the device. Their cat and mouse game becomes a whirlwind romance of constant movement and escape.By the third segment they reach Sydow's underground lab in Australlia, where they also discover that the device cannot only record seeing for the blind, but can record dreams if left on during sleep. The aboriginals who run the lab with Sydow refuse to work on his dream machine. Slowly but believably the rest of the staff, becomes obsessed with staring into the recordings of their dreams, It got to the point where they dreamed of their dreams...and fell ever deeper into the black well of Narcissus ..There are car crashes, planes losing power midlight, and one gorgeous locale after another.

Tecnhology is a double edged sword, amazing but not without its serious ethical and philosophical dilemmas (which is the more real world the one within or without? etc), this movie doesn't delve into it conversation wise, it's lets everything play out, at five hours it gives you the credit that you can work it out for yourself.It's really just a beautiful film to watch, that's much sweeter and gentler than most sci-fi, and more fascinating too because it doesn't shove its implications down your throat.Wim Wenders, got people like The Talking Heads, Can, Lou Reed, Patti Smith, Elvis Costello, U2, Nick Cave, and many many more, to make original songs for the soundtrack about the new millennium.

Despite its hefty run time, I thought Wenders was sensitive, to the changing dynamics of the future world, it's not dystopian and it's not Star Trek\/Fifth Element Space Opera either, it occupies, a space, where simple good or bad, are no longer really relevant to discussion.At one point when everyone assumes the world has ended Sam Niel's character is playing in a small band with several Aboriginal neural scientists, a few french-bank robbers, a British bounty hunter, and some random strays who wandered into the Australian compound fearful of nuclear fallout, and they play a music that sounds like Australlian Blue Grass; Didgeridoo's and pianos, harmonica's, and trumpets, blending together to create something singular and new.

The Sky Over Berlin(Wings Of Desire, is the hookey US title, not translation) is the only film I have ever seen to give a truly 3rd person view, a Gods Eye POV. The story is of two Angels, who observe(from always elevated camera angels), the lives and thoughts of human beings. Most of the film is from this first person black and white POV(the humans perceptive is in color), a camera floating over random people, listening into their thoughts(reminiscent of REM's Everybody Hurts video, except no one disappears, and this came out first). If your okay with the ultimate form of people watching, being both disembodied and an intimate psychic voyeur, this is great. If you want to see something where a lot of stuff happens, watch the Happening, it's okay too. What does happen is few and far between, the angels talk a little, their conversations are like poems, they stand next to or press their hands against miserable people making them brighten and become less narrow for a moment(it doesn't always work), and become enamored with mortals. One angel makes repeat visits to a small circus to watch an acrobat, who may have to quit working at the circus soon and go back to being a waitress til same time next year. She loves being on high and is afraid of falling in a number of ways, her thoughts have a quality similar to the way the angels speak to one another. The Angel is afraid\/excited with the idea of descending to the world as well, his fascination with her makes sense. If this is beginning to sound familiar its because this was remade in the 90's with Nicolas Cage as City Of Angels, but is otherwise a completely different movie, and besides this one has performances from Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds, and that one has Meg Ryan. As for why there are so many musical performances, well the last song, he plays is called From Her To Eternity' I had never heard it before, but the chorus was loud enough for me to hear that phrase, again and again. I got the message, ya know the expression, music is the language of the soul. The structure is basically linear though, we follow the angel around, his thoughts are the thoughts of whoever he crosses, there is a subplot involving Peter Falk, playing Peter Falk as an actor in Berlin shooting a film, strangers call him Columbo, he thinks about Colombo's lack of wearing a hat, maybe he shouldn't wear one in this new movie too. He seems aware of the angels presence, as we are made aware he is an actor in a movie.

Some fantasies, however silly, we want. This movie is one of them. The themes of the beauty the most trivial moments of life, is cleverly and clearly displayed. But to me this made just as much sense as a movie about loneliness, and being an observer, a person always on the outside of things looking in, and deciding to take a dive into the imperfect world of other people, as it did anything else. There's a children's book called the Shy Creatures, about a little who never speaks in class, tells her teacher she wants to be a doctor, to big foot, loch ness and other imaginary beasts(should they stub their toes, or catch colds), who are not really monsters at all, just incredibly shy like her, which is why they always keep out of view, and in the shadows.

I think it isn't that in Blade Runner the Replicants are human too, they are the ONLY humans.Deckard, the three scientists who are in charge of designing, the eyes, the body, and the brains, of the Replicants, and Edward James Olmos, are all just doing their job. They exist to serve a function, and to perform a task and they do so, like machines. The scientists are practically on an assembly line, each designing a piece, so as not to comprehend the meaning of the whole. The eyes are the window to the soul Rutger Haur notes, meeting the man who designed his eyes, yet this man knows nothing. The first image in Blade Runner, is a close up on eye with the city reflected from it, as if within the soul there is nothing but a dark city full of smog, fire, and billboards (eyes and screens are recurrent visual motif that come up again and again in this). The first view we are introduced to, the perspective is that of someone whose soul contains nothing, but a reflection of the world around them.Deckard is a little annoyed that he has to come out of retirement, but what are you gonna do, your not us, your little people as his boss tells him. Only the replicants ask human questions and are driven by human desires like who am I, why do I exist, how can I escape death. For PKD and Ridley Scott, it would seem, these are the fundamental questions which all sentient beings must ask themselves, in order to become human. Without which we lose what makes us any more than biological furniture. More human than human is our motto, as the good doctor says about his clone factory.Deckard and the rest of the future, is trapped in a constant darkness where the sun never comes up and the only light comes from giant advertisements, that absorb the landscape into themselves. People scurry about like ants (unconcerned or unaware of the world around them), and even Deckard who has the benefit of not being little people spends his time, like a burn out film noir detective, in a dim apartment, killing time.The Replicants have become more human than the human beings. They like Deckard used to kill for a living, but abandoned that for the possibility of something more, which he has not. Their actions are driven by a need to live as something more than an object and body. Theirs is an existential ordeal, in a world of economic determinism. Their actions though possibly futile are still authentic, they are their actions, and no one else's. Hauer killing off his creator, is a little like Don Quixote fighting off his windmills, an absurd waste of energy, though it's Hauer's awareness and Quixote's lack there of, which defines them as a character, and human beings.We assume that since Harrison Ford is the lead we are supposed to empathize with him, which I imagine is where all the irrelevant conjecture about him being a replicant comes from. It doesn't matter if he is or isn't, because the real criterion for humanity is not birthright, but performance. It's only through meeting the scientists assistant who doesn't know she is a replicant, is he faced with doing something that violates his social programming. By the end it's implied, that he will save the woman, risking himself for someone who will only live four or five years anyway.He has recognized not just that Hauer or those he killed were real thinking people like himself, but that they in fact were better than him, closer in classic terms to being authentic people(the unexamined life is not worth livingetc), because at least they know they are fake, and chose to struggle anyway. Only when faced with artificial reproductions of ourselves (be it robots, stories, paintings, photos, movies, sculpture, etc), do we get a reflection of what is to be human.Or as one of my favorites PKD quotes, says in other words So we and our elaborately evolving computers may meet each other halfway. Someday a human being, named perhaps Fred White, may shoot a robot named Pete Something-or-other, which has come out of a General Electric factory, and to his surprise see it weep and bleed. And the dying robot may shoot back and, to its surprise, see a wisp of gray smoke arise from the electric pump that it supposed was Mr. White's beating heart. It would be rather a great moment of truth for both of them. So not exactly an I, Robot film about robo-equal rights, or a Matrix cautionary 'the machines will get us story. Instead Ridley Scott shows us a world where human beings are less than machines, more privileged, colder, less aware, and without compassion, and does so in a visual landscape unlike anything movies had seen before ","genre":null},{"date":"28 April 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Someone asked me whats the point of this besides Replicants are human too, duh.

I think it isn't that in Blade Runner the Replicants are human too, they are the ONLY humans.Deckard, the three scientists who are in charge of designing, the eyes, the body, and the brains, of the Replicants, and Edward James Olmos, are all just doing their job. They exist to serve a function, and to perform a task and they do so, like machines. The scientists are practically on an assembly line, each designing a piece, so as not to comprehend the meaning of the whole. The eyes are the window to the soul Rutger Haur notes, meeting the man who designed his eyes, yet this man knows nothing. The first image in Blade Runner, is a close up on eye with the city reflected from it, as if within the soul there is nothing but a dark city full of smog, fire, and billboards (eyes and screens are recurrent visual motif that come up again and again in this). The first view we are introduced to, the perspective is that of someone whose soul contains nothing, but a reflection of the world around them.Deckard is a little annoyed that he has to come out of retirement, but what are you gonna do, your not us, your little people as his boss tells him. Only the replicants ask human questions and are driven by human desires like who am I, why do I exist, how can I escape death. For PKD and Ridley Scott, it would seem, these are the fundamental questions which all sentient beings must ask themselves, in order to become human. Without which we lose what makes us any more than biological furniture. More human than human is our motto, as the good doctor says about his clone factory.Deckard and the rest of the future, is trapped in a constant darkness where the sun never comes up and the only light comes from giant advertisements, that absorb the landscape into themselves. People scurry about like ants (unconcerned or unaware of the world around them), and even Deckard who has the benefit of not being little people spends his time, like a burn out film noir detective, in a dim apartment, killing time.The Replicants have become more human than the human beings. They like Deckard used to kill for a living, but abandoned that for the possibility of something more, which he has not. Their actions are driven by a need to live as something more than an object and body. Theirs is an existential ordeal, in a world of economic determinism. Their actions though possibly futile are still authentic, they are their actions, and no one else's. Hauer killing off his creator, is a little like Don Quixote fighting off his windmills, an absurd waste of energy, though it's Hauer's awareness and Quixote's lack there of, which defines them as a character, and human beings.We assume that since Harrison Ford is the lead we are supposed to empathize with him, which I imagine is where all the irrelevant conjecture about him being a replicant comes from. It doesn't matter if he is or isn't, because the real criterion for humanity is not birthright, but performance. It's only through meeting the scientists assistant who doesn't know she is a replicant, is he faced with doing something that violates his social programming. By the end it's implied, that he will save the woman, risking himself for someone who will only live four or five years anyway.He has recognized not just that Hauer or those he killed were real thinking people like himself, but that they in fact were better than him, closer in classic terms to being authentic people(the unexamined life is not worth livingetc), because at least they know they are fake, and chose to struggle anyway.

This theme is a similar theme of Bedtime Stories. In both films someone is getting the raw deal when it comes to promotions. Along with a theme, Working Girl has one main motif. The motif is a song played throughout the film. The song put you in almost the same state of mind as Tess. There were also many different camera angles in this film. The best camera shot I can recall from the film is the very last shot. This shot starts as a close up on Tess' face and zooms out of her office window to show that she has achieved her goal.The theme of Working Girl was great. It sends a great message to society.

Beginning of the 80's was a period when movie making turned to what it is today, a pure business, and no art. Accountants always ran the studios, and what is worse decided on what should be filmed and how, but up until the 80's, artists and talented filmmakers could find space to work freely and produce beautiful classics. Cimino made Heaven's Gate trying to do what Orson Welles did in 1941 making Citizen Kane, with Kubrick-like perfection in mind and with his education in painting, he made beautiful movie but was ultimately stopped in his tracks and never allowed to put his vision on the screen, the way he imagined it. The 219 minute version that came out in 1980, before it was severely cut up, and again in 2004, was a taste of what this movie could be if it was made like Cimino wanted it to.First of all this film is one of the most beautifully shot movies ever. The scenes are fantastic and they look like Claude Monet paintings most of the time (best example Kristofferson and Huppert's picnic by the river, and scene of the clouds passing over). Cimino waited a whole day on the set to capture beautiful moments like that, forgetting to eat or drink,like a painter in a daze, or sculptor engulfed in making a sculpture that epitomizes his dream. Story is well paced, and all the complaints of scenes being overlong or some of them surplus, are totally out of place. Look at the Deer Hunter everybody still raves about, the wedding scene at the beginning, takes up the third of the film, the whole movie consists of five overlong scenes, and nobody complained about that. Cimino wanted this movie to be his Citizen Kane, and he said that he wanted it to be realistic in it's portrayal of the times to the best of his knowledge, which is often neglected by filmmakers in order to scrap up the movie for the least amount of money in shortest time possible, just to keep the assembly line going, and that usually destroys the whole concept of the film. The trouble is that the accountants didn't care if it's close to being perfect. They just wanted something to move over the counter, and fast. Character development and plausibility of some scenes may be in question, but the movie was cut short to start with, and if you start looking for totally plausible Hollywood film, you won't get far. Sometimes it's also known as an artistic freedom.What's most important is that this movie never had a chance, it was misconceived, criticized and bad mouthed long before it was even completed and hundred times repeated lie becomes the truth. So this movie was never judged on it's own merit, as UA executive Steven Bach has told in Final Cut, the making of Heaven's Gate, and the unmaking of a studio. People went to see it, knowing that it's bad, long before they even saw it, so a lot of them, when asked about the film, repeated what they red in movie reviews, and the long scenes complaint is the best example, it sounds like the scene from Amadeus, where Emperor Joseph II, criticizes Mozart's opera because it has too many notes. The premature criticism of the film probably has a lot to do with the story of the movie, it portrays a bloody picture of the birth of a nation, and everybody still wanted to believe in John Ford's and King Vidor's westerns. I hope that this movie will find it's rightful place in the years to come. It deserves to be acclaimed at least as much as Paul Thomas Anderson's There will be blood.

It differed from normal superhero movies, from which the normal structure is normal man - something weird happens to him - he gets special powers - he uses them for the good - another man gets powers too, but uses them for the bad - fight between the superhero and the villain. This film wasn't a film in which the good fight against the bad. There was just no clear line between good and bad. And I thought that worked out very well.

Other giants of the epic travelogue - John Sturges, Lawrence Kasdan, Richard Attenborough, Mel Gibson, Ridley Scott, Peter Jackson - while boring and\/or insulting me much of the time, at least usually manage to get the ideas across in a shot or two, abetted by dialog best presented on T-shirts. If Noel Coward had been the director, instead of just a third unit helpmate to his old partner, it would have made sense and it would have been two hours shorter and it would have been better. In fact it would have been good.I have to admit that while no less bad, most of Lean's other gigantic pieces of shite, like BRIDGE ON THE RIVER WHY? and DOCTOR ZZZZZZ, do not confuse me. They are good traditional travelogues in the Old Hollywood vein say it early, say it often, say it again if in doubt. Funny, 'cause I kind of like his GREAT EXPECTATIONS, a much more watchable film (and certainly not small in scope) than the book is readable.

Other giants of the epic travelogue - John Sturges, Lawrence Kasdan, Richard Attenborough, Mel Gibson, Ridley Scott, Peter Jackson - while boring and\/or insulting me much of the time, at least usually manage to get the ideas across in a shot or two, abetted by dialog best presented on T-shirts. If Noel Coward had been the director, instead of just a third unit helpmate to his old partner, it would have made sense and it would have been two hours shorter and it would have been better. In fact it would have been good.I have to admit that while no less bad, most of Lean's other gigantic pieces of shite, like BRIDGE ON THE RIVER WHY? and DOCTOR ZZZZZZ, do not confuse me. They are good traditional travelogues in the Old Hollywood vein say it early, say it often, say it again if in doubt. Funny, 'cause I kind of like his GREAT EXPECTATIONS, a much more watchable film (and certainly not small in scope) than the book is readable. But going back that far I believe he was still under the influence of his benign Svengali, Coward.

Lawrence's book SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM. Theroux, in response to Borges' praise of it, said a clever thing How can a book about Arabs not be funny? True. SEVEN PILLARS, while wonderful in many respects, is a relentlessly grim chronicle of disillusionment. In this respect, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is true to its source material. But this does not deserve reverence. To repeat a mistake is to commit an even greater folly.Grandiose does not equal grand, and spectacle is not of itself spectacular. Yes, this movie looks great, and it is one of the most auspicious and audacious entrances an actor has ever made onto the world stage. But man, is it dull. Anyone not bored by multiple offerings of five minutes' empty pageantry - a thousand camels marching off to battle (which never is satisfactorily joined) - is more easily amused than I. I liked this movie when I was a kid. Now I do not like this movie. It is too long, for one thing, not that long is bad per se, but long and incoherent is very bad. I've finally noticed that what's really wrong with this picture, aside from being directed by the most overrated A-lister in the history of the tenth art, is its inability to tell a story. What is going on at any given point after the first couple of hours - in the campaign, in T.E.'s head, in the battle - is obviously of inferior importance to how it looks. Now, this is a major achievement. To be incoherent in a travelogue-depth 4-hour yawnathon of pedantic phrasemaking is not only to defeat the purpose of a travelogue (which is to make clear for adults what was possibly too confusing for children), it is to complicate the logic of simplicity by means cunning and nefarious, for no apparent gain or purpose.

I was quickly reminded of how boring and drawn out it is, and even though it's beautiful I needed something w\/ more of a pace. If you are a Meryl Streep fan, she gives a knockout performance and the movie is worth watching for her alone. However this movie flows like The Bridges of Madison County, another amazing performance in a film that I will never rewatch b\/c it is so slow, but she embodies those characters well. The cinematography, lighting, shots, locations are outstanding, yet make the story move slowly and beautifully, yet the story is hard to follow and makes u so bored that it is hard to separate story lines. All in all, a beautiful film if you do not have digital cable, youtube, myspace, facebook, or an iphone, b\/c those will make u distracted and lose focus. This movie would not be enjoyable to anyone ADD, ADHD, w\/ a short attention span, who did not go to an Ivey League school, or someone who takes a lot of breaks. If you are in a hospital bed or retired you might enjoy this slow-moving long journey.
