Kurt Russell is washed up in here, never was a fan of his acting but could always appreciate him if he did a good performance. Here - he didn't. I mean he's still Kurt but his acting here could have been a lot better. There are nice supporting parts by Steve Buscemi, Stacy Keach and Cliff Robertson but nothing to be crazy about. Whole film is rather fast paced and we do have a lot of special effects on a good level which is always nice to see in a blockbuster movie. Music score by John Carpenter is probably the best thing in entire movie - It's tense as it should be which is great. I liked the satire on politics and society and there is nothing really bad about 'Escape from LA' but It's just not near that raw, brutal and tense as the original was. I found the movie to be OK at best. Russell couldn't keep me interested enough. Maybe one day I will give it a chance again but for now, I don't feel like I need to own it in my collection.

It's got powerfully effective atmosphere, dazzling landscapes, innovative visuals, memorable special effects, and a slowly, steadily building sense of dread. Nowadays, in genre fare the convention is to knock people out of their socks with spectacle and constant action (not to mention quick cutting); here, the filmmakers, led by the visionary director Ridley Scott (in only his second feature film) dare to take their time and parcel out the horror carefully. In fact, the big money shot of this film doesn't even occur until almost the halfway point. And what a potent scene it is, in its time having the ability to shock viewers out of their complacency. The story, for those folk who may still be newcomers to this experience, deals with the crew of an interstellar towing vehicle who intercept an extraterrestrial S.O.S. and are obliged to check it out. What they find are a derelict spacecraft, an unpleasant truth about that message, and an insidious alien menace that proceeds to make mincemeat out of the terrified individuals involved. Alien was revelatory in the way that it introduced a new breed of space traveller to the science-fiction genre, one that didn't dress in uniform but who represented the average working Joe or Jane. It also created one of the most striking creatures to be found in cinema, one that grew in stages, and did unpleasant things to the human body. The design is by the great Swiss artist H.R. Giger, the execution by the late Carlo Rambaldi, and its hideous sexual overtones are not lost on viewers. Jerry Goldsmiths' music is beautifully eerie and nicely understated at times. Even the opening credits have a fantastic, spooky simplicity to them. The limited number of human characters insures a high degree of intimacy, and the actors, a superb mix of American and British talent - Tom Skerritt as the ineffective Captain Dallas, John Hurt as the fatally inquisitive Kane, Sigourney Weaver (in the breakout performance that made her a star) as the take-charge Ripley, Harry Dean Stanton as the laid-back Brett, Yaphet Kotto as the argumentative Parker, Ian Holm as the subtly dubious Ash, and Veronica Cartwright as nervous wreck Lambert - completely draw us in to the reality of their situation. As things progress, one will notice that the pace picks up considerably in the second half, as things quickly go from bad to worse to unthinkable. Plus, the script (screenplay by Dan O'Bannon, based on a story by him and Ronald Shusett) definitely has something to say about the nefarious nature of corporate interests. All these years later, the film is still quite capable of chilling audiences, and set forth a beloved franchise including three sequels and two crossover projects with the Predator series.

Leave it to Hollywood to turn a prosaic, meticulous scientific endeavor like archaeology into a spectator sport; the opening action sequence finds the film's hero, after capturing the object of his mission, cradling it like a football and sprinting like a halfback out of the buried site of ruins, dodging booby-trapped poison darts all the way. The premise of Raiders of the Lost Ark is credited to the creative genius of George Lucas, who somehow hit upon the idea of replacing an academic profession marked by a slow, gradual pursuit of truths about human prehistory with a romantic, mercenary endeavor, in which the practitioners are pirates in a high-speed, cutthroat, competitive race for buried treasures that have been buried for thousands of years. One of those pirates is now one of the most recognizable movie heroes of all time. Like Superman, Indiana Jones maintains a mild manner in his day job and dons iconic garb to pursue his true passion. Instead of reporting, Jones teaches at university; instead of fighting crime, he risks life and limb to unearth important historical artifacts, which he sells to museums. Like the various eras of remote history imprinted into the living rocks, layer upon layer, Raiders was developed through an escalating application of movie talents. Lucas's idea developed into a perfectly understated screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan, became fully realized under the stylish, high-energy direction of Steven Spielberg, and achieved legendary status through a star-making performance by Harrison Ford and a film-score masterwork by composer John Williams. Jones, as played by Ford and directed by Spielberg, is slightly more than a hero, but well short of a superhero. His face is unshaven. He sweats. He looks like he hasn't showered in days, and he probably has bad breath. When he first steps into the light in South America, he is still in the shadows. When he swings from a vine, and we first hear his heroic theme, he falls and plops into the water, well short of the amphibious airplane that rescues him from pursuing natives. And when he gets into the getaway plane, he is met with the pilot's pet snake, which we learn Jones hates. This is a real man, with real vulnerabilities. John Williams' musical soundtrack aside, Raiders sounds astoundingly good, as exemplified by the scene in Nepal, where Jones meets Toht, the most sinister of his Nazi enemies, and Marion, the most important of his allies. From start to finish, Raiders is virtually non-stop action and intrigue, infused with humor, and polished with a touch of romance. It is a treasure hunt over three thousand years in the making, the object of which&#x97;the Ark of the Covenant&#x97;adds a spiritual, mystical dimension to a film that otherwise follows a standard action\/adventure story arc. And although the end can be criticized for its deus ex machina resolution, it is the end that gives the film its soul. God in Raiders is interventionist and vengeful, and He punishes the Nazis and their accomplices for disturbing the vessel that held the tablets on which were written the Ten Commandments&#x97;the Covenant&#x97;which they have broken through their evil ways. Indy and Marion are spared, not just because they are good, but because Indy knows not to look. It's all part of a strange archaeological and religious folklore that somehow makes sense within the context of the movie, and somehow fits in with the film's Saturday matinée, Summer blockbuster appeal.

He reaches a nondescript gravestone and falls to his knees, uncontrollably weeping. Within this frame of reference is another set of bookends two unforgettable battle sequences. Like its epic World War II film predecessors&#x97;The Longest Day and A Bridge Too Far&#x97;Saving Private Ryan features a long list of key and supporting actors, including Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Matt Damon, Ted Danson, Paul Giamatti, Dennis Farina, and Bryan Cranston. Also like its predecessors, the featured actors, who may or may not have served, do justice to the material and pay tribute, with earnest portrayals, to the men who helped make their comfortable American lifestyles possible. The first battle, at Omaha Beech during the landings at Normandy, is staggeringly realistic in its brutal recreation of June 6, 1944. The omnipresence of Spielberg's documentary-style camera assures us that the relentless intensity of that violent confrontation does not escape our attention, even if no single viewpoint could have witnessed the totality of the carnage. Back in the States, a woman in a government office, typing sympathy letters to mothers of soldiers killed in action, notices what appears to be a discrepancy, but reveals itself as the premise of the plot a soldier named James Ryan has lost all three of his brothers in battle. The order to find Ryan and secure his safe return home falls to Captain John Miller (Hanks) who, along with those members of his squad who have survived the landing, embark on a rescue mission, the value of which they question every step of the way. Writer Robert Rodat makes a valiant attempt to weave character development, philosophy, and humor into the action-oriented middle. Much of it succeeds; some of it rings false. The more effective moments of character revelation are in those scenes that are divorced momentarily from the action, like the one that takes place in the ruins of the church, or the one on the steps. Easily the most heart-wrenching (and gut-wrenching) scene finds Medic Irwin Wade (Ribisi) downed by gunfire, surrounded by the group trying to tend to his wounds through his guidance. He asks them for clinical descriptions of what they are seeing and feeling, and then becomes anguished when he deduces that he has been hit in the liver. They beg him to tell them how to fix him. Resigned to his fate, he just asks for more morphine. When we finally meet up with Private Ryan (Damon), he refuses to abandon the only brothers he has left. There is some talk about conflicting orders and impossible decisions, but it seems obvious what has to happen Miller and his men will assist Ryan's squad in securing the bridge before sending Ryan home. The development of Ryan's character is, to say the least, disappointing. I have two brothers of my own, and I find it hard to believe that a man, even after two years of displacement, would not be able to picture the faces of any of his brothers, and the only story that he chooses to relate about his brothers (and the only one we witness) is frivolous, emotionless, and unfunny. I also find Upham's cowardly hesitation a bit difficult to comprehend, as genuinely moving is his moment of redemption. In the end, what we learn about these men is that they are ordinary. The emotions we feel at their passing are not for distinctly drawn, sympathetic characters that we have come to know and love&#x97;without whom we can't bear to endure; these overtaking emotions stem from our projections onto those real men who lost real lives in defense of our own. Therein lies the successful failure of Saving Private Ryan whether intentional or not, the non-commanding presence of its fictional characters, paralleled by John Williams' brilliantly simplistic three-note theme, leaves room for the audience to ponder and appreciate the quiet, commonplace heroism of those average people who fought the actual war.

Back in the States, a woman in a government office, typing sympathy letters to mothers of soldiers killed in action, notices what appears to be a discrepancy, but reveals itself as the premise of the plot a soldier named James Ryan has lost all three of his brothers in battle. The order to find Ryan and secure his safe return home falls to Captain John Miller (Hanks) who, along with those members of his squad who have survived the landing, embark on a rescue mission, the value of which they question every step of the way. Writer Robert Rodat makes a valiant attempt to weave character development, philosophy, and humor into the action-oriented middle. Much of it succeeds; some of it rings false. The more effective moments of character revelation are in those scenes that are divorced momentarily from the action, like the one that takes place in the ruins of the church, or the one on the steps. Easily the most heart-wrenching (and gut-wrenching) scene finds Medic Irwin Wade (Ribisi) downed by gunfire, surrounded by the group trying to tend to his wounds through his guidance. He asks them for clinical descriptions of what they are seeing and feeling, and then becomes anguished when he deduces that he has been hit in the liver. They beg him to tell them how to fix him. Resigned to his fate, he just asks for more morphine. When we finally meet up with Private Ryan (Damon), he refuses to abandon the only brothers he has left. There is some talk about conflicting orders and impossible decisions, but it seems obvious what has to happen Miller and his men will assist Ryan's squad in securing the bridge before sending Ryan home. The development of Ryan's character is, to say the least, disappointing. I have two brothers of my own, and I find it hard to believe that a man, even after two years of displacement, would not be able to picture the faces of any of his brothers, and the only story that he chooses to relate about his brothers (and the only one we witness) is frivolous, emotionless, and unfunny. I also find Upham's cowardly hesitation a bit difficult to comprehend, as genuinely moving is his moment of redemption. In the end, what we learn about these men is that they are ordinary. The emotions we feel at their passing are not for distinctly drawn, sympathetic characters that we have come to know and love&#x97;without whom we can't bear to endure; these overtaking emotions stem from our projections onto those real men who lost real lives in defense of our own. Therein lies the successful failure of Saving Private Ryan whether intentional or not, the non-commanding presence of its fictional characters, paralleled by John Williams' brilliantly simplistic three-note theme, leaves room for the audience to ponder and appreciate the quiet, commonplace heroism of those average people who fought the actual war. When Captain Miller tells Private Ryan to earn this, in a sense, he is asking us to live our lives in a way that will earn the price paid by those bands of brothers who sacrificed it all.

Rocky wins the bout and bums a half-smoked cigarette on his way to his locker. In spite of his victory, a woman in the crowd puts him down, calling him a bum. Nevertheless, he'll take home winner's share that night for his effort a little over forty dollars. Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is down on his luck and down for the count, which, in boxing lingo, means that he's running out of time. He's not the only one. His friend Paulie (Burt Young), who still lives with his sister Adrian (Talia Shire), bemoans that they're all gonna die alone. Rocky's a nobody surrounded by losers on their way to nowhere. And then he wins the lottery. The world heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), suddenly out a ranked contender to fight in an upcoming bicentennial event in Philadelphia, decides to pick a local boxer at random to fill in. He gives the title shot to Rocky (of course) because he likes his nickname The Italian Stallion. Rocky's take for fighting the champ will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Like other lottery winners, Rocky's friends step out of the woodwork to capitalize on his fortune. Paulie comes up with an advertising angle using Rocky's name. Rocky's loan-shark boss, Gazzo, gives him five hundred bucks for training expenses and says not to worry about it, but we know he expects some return on his investment. And Mickey (Burgess Meredith), who recently gave away Rocky's locker at his local gym, comes knocking on his door to offer him his management services. The only one immune to the bandwagon effect is Adrian. Stallone, who also wrote Rocky, smartly positions the scene in which Rocky and Adrian fall for each other before Creed's promoter, Jergens, makes Rocky his offer. Rocky is an extremely well-written movie, especially in the dialogue and character arenas. Each of the principal characters is given distinctive, nuanced characteristics, believable motivations, and strong development, filled out by four Oscar-nominated performances. Naturally rhythmic dialogue is punctuated by bursts of relationship-defining moments Mickey spouting his disappointment in Rocky's choice to become a leg-breaker instead of a respectable fighter, Rocky temporarily fending off Mickey's last-ditch effort to soak up some of Rocky's glory, Adrian's defense against Paulie's unsubstantiated rant. Rocky is also an extremely well-scored movie. If the outstanding writing, acting, directing, and editing hasn't already done the job, Bill Conti's original music will virtually guarantee that the viewer feels everything that this film is about. Philadelphia Morning&#x97;which accompanies the first training scene, the one in which Rocky can't make it all the way up the steps&#x97;embodies tender regret for a life possibly wasted and an opportunity possibly granted too late in the game. Counterpoint that with the longing, uplifting, victorious song Gonna Fly Now&#x97;which is played when he does make his way up the steps, salvaging, for the moment, a bit of hope. The war music underscoring the final fight (Going the Distance) is indescribably moving, especially in the middle, where it breaks down into a sad, lonely, struggling violin, as Rocky tries desperately to stand up, while Mickey, like a father protecting his son, pleads with him to stay down. The framing of this fight, inspired by an actual bout in which Chuck Wepner lasted fifteen rounds with Muhammad Ali, dramatically demonstrates the award-winning directing talent of John G. Alvidsen and the award-winning editing talents of Richard Halsey and Scott Conrad. Like any effective drama, this final showdown fully exposes the heart of the film. It's obvious that Apollo Creed possesses superior athletic ability over Rocky. It's possible that Creed is just not in the best shape of his career, and that Rocky's left-handedness is throwing him off balance. But none of this really matters. When the fight announcer wonders aloud what could be keeping Rocky up, the probable answer has nothing to do with boxing ability. What is keeping him up is an iron will forged by a lifetime of being stepped over, knocked around, and kicked aside the kind of life that can turn any man into a force to be reckoned with. After the fight is over, Rocky tries to field questions from the ring announcer, but he quickly realizes he's never been in this situation before. Like a scared child who has wandered too far from home, he calls for his mother, and she rescues him. Rocky loses the decision, but he's beaten the clock; he's still standing during the final bell, he's proved himself a winner to his hometown, he's redeemed his self-respect, and he's won Adrian's heart. Fitting rewards for the ultimate underdog in movie history.

The first half takes place on and around Amity Island, which is inhabited by a small summer tourist community in the Atlantic, where Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) seems to serve as the entire police department. When a girl's freshly severed arm washes up onto the beach, Brody, who correctly surmises the cause to be a shark attack, attempts to close the beach, only to meet strong opposition from Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), who sides with the local business owners who depend on summer dollars for their very lives. The mayor explains away the girl's death as a boating accident and orders the beach to remain open. Several attacks later, Brody finally convinces Vaughn to allow him to hire a local shark hunter, Sam Quint (Robert Shaw) to kill the shark. Chief Brody and a shark expert from the oceanographic institute, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), accompany Quint on his mission, and their hunting expedition on board the Orca constitutes the second half of the film. Across both halves, Jaws manages to cover all of the three main types of story conflict. Brody and Hooper's struggle with Mayor Vaughn and his constituents in the first half exemplifies the conflict of Man versus Man. In the second half, Man battles Nature as the crew of the Orca pursues the Great White. Both Brody and Quint fight with themselves; Brody must battle his fear of the water, and Quint, a Captain-Ahab-like figure, must deal with his tragic flaw of selfish pride in refusing help from technology or outsiders in killing the shark. The shark hunt in the second half of Jaws is an escape, as well as deliverance. The ensuing adventure on the open sea contrasts nicely with the horror\/slasher\/suspense piece that comes before it. It's also like a mini-vacation for Brody, who, in the first half, is inundated with annoying requests from various islanders. The three-man pursuit of the shark, though scary, provides the singular excitement of a focused objective that releases Brody from all of the scattered, petty demands of his island job. It's a joy to watch these three very different men come together towards a common goal and mutual appreciation. Spielberg and company tell Peter Benchley's story with plenty of humor, and though his score is known for the shark theme, which has become synonymous with impending danger, John Williams provides an interlude that makes Jaws a feast for the ears. The finale of the film is explosive and satisfying as it features the triumph of a common man who always gets his shark.

This supercharged, high-octane, but improbable shoot'em up concerns renegade Army General who takes civilian hostages, occupies Alcatraz Prison with a small force, and threatens to fire poison rockets with deadly VX gas at San Francisco if the government refuses to bow to his demands. The FBI assigns Special Agent Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage of Con-Air) to the case, and he receives help from the only man who successfully escaped from Alcatraz. As it turns out, this brilliant individual is former British secret service agent John Mason (Sean Connery of Zardoz) who has been buried in the U .S. Penal system because he got his hands of all of America's top-secrets. FBI Director Womack (John Spencer) fears Mason. He sends in Goodspeed to negotiate with Mason. Naturally, Mason demands a trip into San Francisco, a meal in a sumptuous hotel, and a haircut. Eventually, a reluctant Mason leads Cage under the island, and they set out to disarm the rockets.

I did not quite get it in the first few seconds of the demonstration sequence, not because I could not follow a complex editing or screenplay but I just did not see it coming in a movie of that era. This is one of the most elaborate and beautifully written scripts I have ever come across.Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) and his team were termed heroes and showered with medals and awards when they fight their way back home through a deep enemy territory during the Korean war. Shaw's mother Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin (Angela Lansbury) is a manipulative power broker now married to Senator John Yerkes Iselin (James Gregory) with a full intent to put him on the pedestal. Major Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) a member of Shaw's team and few others starts to have nightmares that contradict their daring escape story all pointing to something skeptical about Shaw. When Marco begins to lose his mind over this, he starts an unofficial inquiry until he finds something solid.The writing, editing, screenplay and performances were top notch for its time with a lot of emphasis on character development. But the narrative style did put me off sometimes especially Sinatra's piece. The girlfriend\/wife character is out of the blue and does not serve any purpose than for him to go on narrating instead of having a conversation. Though it was brilliant for the writing to show the handlers do a lot of mock tests on their brainwash project before a real approach, the whole thing somehow looks messy and too fictional. The movie could've been easily been 20 minutes lesser in its runtime and action sequences were too dated.

If that's the case, then Jimmy Stewart's performance in Rear Window is one of the greatest ever recorded on film. During most of the movie, we are watching him watching the people across the courtyard enclosed by the apartment complex in which he has been cooped up. We literally witness the events of the film through his eyes. Those eyes eventually witness what he believes to have been a murder, but he has a tough time convincing his three confidants his girlfriend, Lisa Freemont (Grace Kelly), his caregiver, Stella (Thelma Ritter), and his longtime friend, Detective Doyle (Wendell Corey). John Michael Hayes' screenplay is a lesson in misdirection. Not only are we distracted from the central mystery by the lives of the inhabitants of the apartments surrounding the one occupied by the alleged murderer, we become concerned with the challenged relationship between Jeffries (Stewart) and Lisa. Little by little, the focus shifts more and more toward the investigation of Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), Jeffries gains more evidence against his suspect, his confidants buy into his theories, and the comforting separator between Jeffries' apartment and that private world across the courtyard breaks down, until a moment when Thorwald looks up and peers across the divide, directly into Jeffries' camera-turned-spyglass, evincing genuine chills. Hitchcock couldn't be more in his element, directing a voyeuristic murder mystery about a temporarily disabled photographer, replete with blonde bombshells, macabre innuendo, and sweat-inducing suspense. Rear Window has no shortage of humor, intrigue, and romance, but its signature thrill is one to which all avid moviegoers can relate the thrill of watching other people, who don't know they are being watched.

It's obvious from his body of work that Lynch is very interested in depicting the imagery of the subconscious mind. Whether the Elephant Man's dream sequences deepen our experience of the narrative and\/or thematic content of the film&#x97;or distract us from it&#x97;is debatable. What is certain is that Lynch's artistic decisions and unconventional treatment of the subject matter elevate the film beyond mere melodrama. Anthony Hopkins' performance is noteworthy for its odd combination of quirky sentiment, reflection, and deep, raw, empathetic emotion. John Hurt's physical and mental characterization of the title character is otherworldly (one might say, Heaven-sent), and it is very real, and very moving. The Elephant Man is full of surprises that spring from our continual rediscovery of its main character and from his discovery of the infinitely varying reactions of humanity to him. He starts as a side show and rises to become a main attraction. The film, based on the true events of a real man, is dripping with pathos. Although some emotional moments border on being overdone, most ring true and evoke strong sympathy for a tortured soul whose heart and mind are as good and fine as his body is disfigured. Though he is the character in the film who least resembles a human being physically, John Merrick is undoubtedly the most human&#x97;even more so than the heroic, though motivationally confused, Doctor Frederick Treves, who appears uncomfortable facing emotional situations or expressing emotions of his own. John Merrick is rather obviously a Christ figure; his it is finished line towards the end is no accident. Like Christ, the Elephant Man represents the oppressed&#x97;those who are misunderstood and mistreated because, on the surface, they appear threatening. From within the film's actual historical context (the 19th century), the misunderstood would have included the mentally ill, as well as the physically deformed freaks of every kind. And even though The Elephant Man reminds us how far we've come at understanding the misunderstood, it also points to how deep our xenophobia can run, and how far we have to go.

Neeson's screen presence as Oskar Schindler, the unlikely savior of hundreds of Polish Jews during the Holocaust, is commanding and magnetic. Kingsley's performance as Schindler's accountant and eventual friend is neurotic and tender. Fiennes plays Amon Goeth, a cold, sadistic Nazi officer, with startling range and subtlety. Williams' score and Spielberg's camera are characters in their own right, narrating and observing with unnerving honesty and pathos. From the perspective of the captive Jews and their plight, Schindler's List is frightening beyond imagination, thrilling, and unbearably sad. From Schindler's perspective, the initial prospect of profiting from a slave-wage workforce and an economic climate that only war could engender is opportunistically exciting. But when the plan changes from profit to protection, the excitement takes on a different form, as Schindler faces the danger of the Nazis discovering his altruistic motives at every turn. From the perspective of the Nazis, the unconstrained license to kill, at justifiably remorseless will, is liberating. Murder is easy, especially when the victims have been dehumanized in a much more savage way than any real wartime enemy. In one scene, a Nazi is firing rounds into a burning hill of murdered Jews, and he is screaming jubilantly and laughing. In another, Amon Goeth picks off random workers from his bird's eye villa as if he is shooting at clay pigeons. It's target practice; it's a free game, a joke. That feeling of irresponsible liberation is eventually supplanted by true liberation as the clandestinely moral acts of Oskar Schindler overtake the immorality of the Nazis and as Schindler assumes the weighty responsibility for more and more human lives. Schindler's List is not a movie about the Holocaust, any more than it is a movie about World War II. It is about a man&#x97;a magnanimous profiteer&#x97;living in a time and place of unspeakable acts. It's about a forbidden friendship that flourishes amidst the failure of humanity and the prevalence of hatred. And it's about the hope for&#x97;not the triumph of&#x97;Good over Evil.
