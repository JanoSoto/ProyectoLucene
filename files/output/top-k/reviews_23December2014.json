[{"date":"23 December 2014","score":"","review":" Thats right 90s was awesome in almost any genre films were awesome way better then what we have today specially in comedy & action this film blue streak was the last true buddy cop,crime action film from late 90s but only after rush hour 1998.Just when millennium 2000 was about to hit & end of the 20th century was near many films came out that year & remained my favorites like the matrix & the world is not enough 007 & this one blue streak was one of them.Blue streak did not garnered enough positive critical or large theatrical reception but it still remains a cult classic among the fans maybe that is just because of Martin Lawrence was in the lead role.The Plotsome thieves commit a robbery one of them miles Logan steals the large diamond but things go awry when police gets alerted miles gets some time to hide the diamond in the under construction area police arrives on the spot & arrests Logan he gets jailed when released he finds out the under construction area is now police station he disguises as a cop & looks for a way to extract the diamond hidden somewhere near the air duct area.From start to finish this film runs of situational & slapstick comedy but more then that the dialogs & quotes are hilarious by Martin Lawrence.The CastLuke Wilson was nice,Tamala Jones was unrecognizable & surprise i liker her in castle TV show 2009,rest of the cast does goo job but real star is Martin Lawrence he just nails it every time love him or hate him the guy is funny & a great comedian next to Chris Tucker.There is a line in this film i find it hilarious when miles says to the officer,what are you gonna do with one shoelace?floss your butt.This is totally not for kids the language is crass,rude & abusive i am surprised at how this is rated PG-13 it should have been Rated-R & this is coming from Sony pictures Columbia wow.The project has its flaws but still the good script,comedy & great acting display saves this film making it totally enjoyable for everyone specially adults.There is a Indian remake of this film out there called Chor Machaye Shor 2002 starting Bobby Deol many of the things are changed in that version,best thing about blue streak is how everyone is after the diamond but miles tricks everyone every time in any situation it is just like the mask film of Jim Carrey.Overall Blue Streak 1999 is a rare underrated gem of a film if you have not seen it yet go grab a copy & watch it my rating is 7\/10Must See ","genre":null},{"date":"23 December 2014","score":"","review":" Thats right 90s was
