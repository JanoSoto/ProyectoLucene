The cinematography, editing, direction and writing are all perfect!  Gregg Toland is a wonderful DP.  Welles and Toland worked closely together to bring this story to the screen, and I think that Toland interpreted Welles' vision perfectly.  Robert Wise's editing is done to perfection as well.  The wipes and fades are all done well, and all done with purpose.  Too many films have editing and cinematography done without thinking of how it will affect the story--Citizen Kane is definitely not one of them.  Also magnificent is the set design.

Has any film ever had so much to offer visually?  There is very little dialogue but a wonderful commentary by a young girl which is haunting in itself, as her voice hynotizes the viewer. The story is simple, these are three very uncomplicated people, subsisting on the streets of Chicago and then taking on jobs as itinerant workers for a wealthy young farmer who is alone and lonely. The girlfriend of the young girl's brother pretends to be his sister also to keep life simple. The farmer falls in love with her. Her boyfriend encourages her to play the farmer along and she marries him and then the passions and emotions start to erupt. The young girl has her own take on all that is happening and just rolls with the punches.  Tragedy ensues. If you want action or mystery or easy resolutions, this is not your movie. If you want cinematography that will take your breath away, a haunting score and commentary this will more than satisfy.  9 out of 10.  Bravo to all.
