Going back and re-watching it not only gives you the same enjoyable experience of seeing a great film, but also the opportunity to notice things you didn't quite catch before or see the same things in a slightly (or totally) different way.The Matrix is that type of movie. A cleverly designed story that speaks about many things on many levels. The most obvious thing here are the spectacular effects that won an Oscar and even spawned the phrase Matrix-like action. They took slow motion and action choreography to a whole new level. But even so, they wouldn't be so great if they weren't part of an innovative story structure that can be seen in a great number of ways. The story can be seen as a heroic quest that the lead character Neo embarks on. A religious and\/or historical allegory due to all the classical names of the characters. Or, even that of a totalitarian police state.The last viewpoint I found particularly interesting as the Matrix is the ultimate Orwellian-nightmare prison. It has full control of your body to the point that it fuels itself with the inmates' body heat. The inmates are kept down by living in a time that is the peak of human civilization and if they defer in anyway, the forces that control the system go after them with police and military forces. The kicker, of course, is that all this is an all illusion and escape, without serious outside help, is an impossibility and even then it's difficult. But how can there be outside help if everyone is asleep in pods? Naturally the story sidesteps this by proving our character with a safe (well, sort of) way out into the real world, but it is hardly a flaw in logic. The story has to start somehow in order for it to go somewhere. Though it remains a fact that trying to imagine how the very first person woke up and then proceeded to wake others remains perplexing.This is a solid smart science fiction film with depth that few blockbusters can ever hope to achieve. So watch it as an action movie. Watch it as a thinking man's movie. But in the end, just watch it. --- 9\/10Rated R for violence.

As they continue on with their lives, they start to notice that there's something wrong with the house, and when he is attacked by a local dog, he is bed-ridden and forces her to bring her friend Dr. Leonard Stafford, (Jonathan Penner) to come out to help her. As the weird events surrounding the family continue, and soon start to branch out to others in the community, they realize that the incidents are caused by the clock, which was brought along from a house in Amityville, New York that once belonged to a deranged teacher who's soul had possessed everything in the house. Realizing the danger, they try to leave the house before they all succumb to the house's evil powers.The Good News This one here is a lot better than expected. One of the good things about it is the film has a couple really great cheesy scenes that work wonderfully. The trick with the light-switch in the living room at the beginning is pretty cool, mainly due to what the room switches over into, a call-out to the original with goo that appears in people's bed one minute and not the next, a really tense moment where a game of sibling roughhousing turns violent and much more. There's also a fantastic sequence where, as one character waits for a microwave to finish, it stops and another character appears suddenly in front of them, going off on a rant about the effectiveness of a particular firearm before turning it on them to question whether or not anything sexual happened between a former couple, then is revealed to all have been a subconscious hallucination. It's big one, though, is when the changed daughter lures the boyfriend down into the basement to sleep with him, only to have the tables turned in a sequence so glorious that the end result has to be seen. It also decides to give way to the sleaze when desired, with the simply superb sequence where, dressed in a night-gown, she proceeds to check herself out in a full-length mirror, and after a couple seconds, the mirror-image begins doing other activities, and soon after pleasuring herself, reaches out of the mirror and repeats it on her in person. It's sleazy and certainly leaves a wonderful impression on it. There's even a pretty nifty, sweat-filled sex-scene that keeps the sleaze moniker intact through most of the film. Aside from the cheese, it has some good stuff in it, most notably the realistic and brutal dog-mauling. This one is incredibly realistic, due to the dog continually going after the same wound time and time again, the absolute refusal to let go and bring the target back closer to it when it tries to escape and ends with it showing a lot of brutality. It's a really great, fantastic scene that really has a lot going it. The last big part in the film that works is the cheesy deaths, which are pretty bloody. There's a fire-poker through the leg, a radio's power cord shoved into the mouth and electrocutes, leaving a dark, festering wound around the point of insertion, impaled in the chest and a rope-hanging, among others to get some nice blood and gore in here. All these here make the film more than enjoyable.The Bad News This one here doesn't have a whole lot of flaws, but they are there. The fact that this one is still a really big cheese-fest is one of the main concerns with this one. It's not completely serious, at least in tone, despite what is offered as being definitely cheesy in appearance, or at least in execution. The conclusion to the basement sequence is quite a perfect example, and is one of the main reasons as to why this one will score lower than most of the other flaws. The ending is another small factor, using a time-honored trick to end it that can be seen coming from a mile away and doesn't have any differences away from the usual. The slow, more methodical pace is something that could've been fixed, mainly since it would've shortened it a bit since there's no reason why this goes on for as long as it does, but otherwise, these here are the film's flaws.The Final Verdict A lot better than expected, this one here has a lot more going on for it than the others and is one of the better entries. Give this one a shot if the series is entertaining or if there's something in it that appeals to you, otherwise then stick away from this one as there's a lot better ones out there.Rated R Violence, Language, animal violence, Nudity and a mild sex scene ","genre":null},{"date":"2 April 2008","score":"","review":" Amityville 1992 It's About Time is a lot better than expected for one of these entries.**SPOILERS**Returning home from work, Jacob Sterling, (Stephen Macht) shows his girlfriend Andrea Livingstone, (Shawn Weatherly) and his family, Lisa, (Megan Ward) and Rusty, (Damon Martin) a new clock that he picked up from his work.
