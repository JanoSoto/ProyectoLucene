With the original strike team killed, the military capture Snake Plissken.  Injecting him with a time limited poison, they send him to LA to recover the device and return it to the US. Like Snake would say `same sh*t, different day'.Joining the list of `why?' sequels, Escape from LA is a belated follow up to Escape From New York.  Apart from trying to kick-start the stuttering and stalling career of John Carpenter, the reasons for making this film are not too clear.  The plot is a straight lift from the original film with a few details changed.  The film is quite basic and episodic with jokes and scenes that are partly designed as part of the plot but mostly aimed at having digs at LA and providing cameos.The problem is that a great deal of this doesn't really work.  Some of the gags are just too obvious (Snake's capture by plastic surgeons) and many of the cameos are pretty lame.  The fact that the scenes are used for comic swipes at LA mean that they aren't designed just to move the film along and, as such, occasionally slow it down and make it all feel very bitty and muddled.What is good about the film is that it is pretty self aware and also seems to play to it's trashy side very well.  The script has a nice running gag about Snake seeming smaller than people expect while the whole style of the film plays like a sci-fi spaghetti western.  It was this aspect that helped me enjoy the film more as the trashy western side of it worked well.  However, the script is poor and most action is just plain silly &#150; I could just about buy Snake making a full court shot in basketball, but the surfing alongside the exact person he was looking for etc all makes it feel a little insulting to my intelligence.Russell sends his character up pretty well, giving his best Clint Eastwood impression throughout.  However the film becomes weak once you look past him in the lead.  Cameos from Buscemi, Grier, Fonda and Keach are all pretty rubbish (Grier especially should be embarrassed) and help to add to the trashy feel to the film (that's not a good thing).  Carpenter does a good job as director in some regards but rubbish in others.  I liked all his spaghetti western touches but much of the action is just plain rubbish.  It doesn't help that the effect shots are nearly all very cheap back shots &#150; I know this was a few years ago and things have moved on, but even for the period the effects are really poor.Overall, this film is poorly structured, poorly presented and trashy from start to finish.

However Frenchy's cookie sales take off and turn the business into a raging success.  One year on, the tunnel has been abandoned and the business has become a legit franchise.  However the wealth they always craved comes with unexpected prices.Held up as some sort of return to form for Woody Allen, this film seems to have a better reputation than it deserves simply because it is quite light and witty at times.  However to say that this film represents some sort of return to form for Woody Allen is doing him a great disservice.  The plot starts out as some sort of caper but, after the first third, starts to spin off into a slightly rambling message about the joys of the simple life.  That is not to say that the majority of the film is not amusing (as it is) but it lacks a good enough structure to support the very light material.Allen's dialogue is pretty amusing but doesn't really amount to much.  The exaggerated caper and good fortune affairs in the first half is much stronger than the latter half simply because the end needs to deliver and it doesn't really manage it.  The cast are all pretty good and their performances match the light material.  Allen is OK and is well matched by Tracey Ullman.  Support from Rapaport, Darrow, Lovitz and Grant is all pretty good but it is obvious that everyone has just been told to try and keep things nice and light and frothy.Overall I enjoyed the first half of the film simply because I like Allen's style of humour and found it to be witty and not really lacking.  However the second half of the film became a little directionless and seemed to be pointing to a moral without actually keeping a grip on the plot at the same time.  Far from his best but, hey, at least there's a few laughs in it!

The film gets off to a good retro beginning with mentions of the hovercraft that transports the guests to Delos (at least it wasn't a monorail) and a shot of a grim-faced pilot wearing mirror-lensed sunglasses. Then we get Richard Benjamin - was ANY actor more essentially seventies than this man? There he sits with a particularly ill-advised moustache, blow-dried hair, a horrible business suit and a roll-neck sweater, getting a lot of valuable practice in for his future role as Walter Matthau's tetchy nephew in THE SUNSHINE BOYS two years later. Here, he's a recently-divorced lawyer who's both excited and apprehensive about his visit to this autonomous wonderland where you can do all the killing, fighting, eating, screwing and mindless damage you like, because you're doing it to androids, who don't mind a bit. (A similar idea was expressed in one of R.Crumb's early ZAP strips.) By his side is James Brolin, his arrogant, seen-it-all-before friend, who you just know is going to come to a sticky end. Insousciance in the face of technology is never a good idea, as any fool who's seen 2001A SPACE ODYSSEY will tell you. Anyway, they get to Westworld and have several violent run-ins with Yul Brynner's deranged robot gunslinger, lots of loose sex with 19th-century bar-room floozies (whose blue eye-shadow and Farrah Fawcett hairstyles were something of an anachronism, even then) and finally sense things are going astray when Brolin gets gnawed by an irate robot snake. Rather than getting the hell out of Dodge, to borrow a hackneyed cliche, they stick around for a good old-fashioned bar-room brawl, oblivious to the fact that the other two Delos resorts are fast degenerating into violent mayhem and anarchy, then Brynner decides that their skinny human butts are his. To cut a long (and often tedious) story short, the final scenes where Benjamin stops being such an uptight feeb and takes decisive action are the best in the movie, with a surprisingly downbeat finale that does pull a few reasonable shocks out of the bag. In some ways, it's too little too late, but Crichton has still managed the underhanded trick of tacking a great ending onto a so-so movie, which makes the whole thing look better in retrospect.WESTWORLD is fine as long as you don't think about it, as Crichton's vision of this automated dystopian resort is subject to some glaring plotholes and flaws. I won't reiterate them here, as most of them seem to have been spotted by previous reviewers, but they are intensely irritating, even when you're watching the thing, and they show up the limitations of what could have been a really good idea. The direction, photography and sets are mostly fine, and the bleak, clinical, featureless control rooms and corridors of Delos look scarily similar to just about any corporate or government official building you might take a walk around today. But those big, bleeping, flashing computers with spinning tape reels and hypnotic screensaver-type graphics look like they were culled from an old episode of The Goodies or Blake's Seven, and the technicians themselves display similarly disgusting seventies hairstyles and dress-sense to the bickering crew members of John Carpenter's DARK STAR.

I'm very happy to say that this movie was the best (okay, at least *one* of the best) science fiction piece that I've seen in a long, long time.The plot in short might sound simple -- a (space) ship crashes on a supposedly deserted planet and the captain, Caroline Fry (impressive Radha Mitchell), must lead the survivors to safety. At first, a cold-blooded murderer, Riddick (Vin Diesel, who plays the role with very believable spare style), might seem like the group's biggest problem but as the dusk starts crawling in, the creatures of the night start awakening... This leads to a desperate attempt to escape from the bloodthirsty predators, which, as we all can guess, does not lead to a happy family picnic.It's not the plot itself that makes the movie worth watching -- after all, let's face it, if you strip it down to the basics it's not *that* original -- but the skill in which it's told. The story flowed forward, didn't leave me yawning (at least not much) in any point. The directing was fabulous work. This was a very visual, even beautiful movie; the purple night view was a real treat. Although, 'beautiful' might not be the right word to use; yes, the images shown were candy to the eye, but they also added a touch of unspecified grotesqueness, eeriness, as if something was just about to burst out from under the still surface.

When he is approached by private collector Boris Balkan to ascertain if his copy of a satanic book is genuine or if one of the other two copies in the world are the real item.  When Corso begins to hunt down the other two books he finds that they each differ in slightly different ways &#150; each having a different scribe for the different pieces.  Meanwhile those holding the books start turning up dead.From the start of the film and throughout, Polanski avoids the `shadows at the windows' approach to making a supernatural film.  Instead the film goes for a more straightforward approach, sidestepping the clichés so often seen in this type of film.  The downside of this approach is that it is quite slow at times and the pacing is too off.  It still kept me interested but I would have happily seen it cut by about 20 minutes to make it tighter.The odd suggestion of the supernatural that the film allows before the end doesn't really work &#150; Seigner's wire-fu stuff doesn't look right, although, in fairness, it would have been hard to show it any other way and still be suggestive enough.  The plot of the film flows well (if slowly) but the ending threw me a little bit.  It will require more thought from me, but my first impressions were `what?'  The ending seemed to come out of nowhere and lacking in meaning and suspense.  I would have much preferred a bigger ending, although the low key, mysterious one works reasonably well in the context of the wider film.Depp is very good in the lead and suits the `ordinary' delivery of the story.  He remains the same all the way through the film and is a good main character.  Langella is excellent &#150; his voice suits his mostly `over the phone' character.  Seigner is interesting but her character requires interpretation while Olin is good (mainly because I don't trust any characters she plays since Alias!).The film was enjoyable despite being too slowly paced to be a tight story.

It follows three convicts - Ulysses McGill, Pete, and Delmar.  I began watching the movie a few minutes into the beginning, so needless to say, I was a bit confused. That confusion followed me through out the whole movie. I knew that it was loosely based on The Odyssey but I think that may have gotten me a bit more confused because I was thinking it would be the exact same thing.  I was looking for something that wasn't there. The three actors were absolutely amazing!  It was because of them that I kept interest and even laughed now and then.  These guys were probably my favorite part of the movie.  I especially enjoyed the part where they thought Pete turned into a frog (which was symbolic of Circe and Odysseus' men being turned into pigs.)  It was so funny how they toted him around everywhere thinking that those women turned him into the frog. (Those women were symbolic of Homer's Sirens who tempted the crew with their song.)  My favorite character, because of this, would probably have to be Delmar. Delmar and Pete just brought an extra special feeling to the whole movie.  Their accents made them sound like funny southern boys and that's exactly what I believe the filmmakers were trying to portray.  With the way they acted and with their dialect, they added a little bit more of a comedic performance.  George Clooney also portrayed his character very well.  I especially like the little hair fetish that was added in.  That was not something that you'd expect from a 1930s Mississippi convict, but it was a really cute touch! Besides from those three characters, my next favorite part of the movie was the music!  This too was absolutely AMAZING!  I enjoyed it so much that I actually went to the library and got a copy of the soundtrack.  I loved the sound of it.  I really believe that it added to the movie.  The sound had a southern country vibe going on and it really helped set the whole setting.  The music really enhanced the story that the filmmakers were trying to get across.  It just put me in the setting and got me a little bit more interested. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I plan on buying that CD pretty soon.  My teacher had mentioned that this movie won an award for its soundtrack and I absolutely believe that they deserved it. I recommend whoever enjoyed the movie to go out and listen to it! Like I mentioned earlier, the film is loosely based on Homer's The Odyssey.  I knew that this was the case before I began watching the movie, so I think that I was comparing the two just a little bit too much.  The fact that I was doing this didn't give me much of a chance to focus on the unique plot of the movie.  There are some things that the two have in common, however.  For example, the three men stop along the trail because they hear a beautiful song.  This was the same situation that Odysseus and his men came across when they met the Sirens. Another similarity is that both the movie and the book had a Cyclops. In the movie, however, the only real reason you could recognize him was because he only had one good eye and Cyclops in the book only had one eye as well.  Of course, George Clooney's character was supposed to represent Odysseus and the whole plot was supposed to resemble that of the book's. Both characters were trying to get home to their wives and families. Other than that, there are not many more similarities.  All in all, though, I would give this movie a seven.  Maybe if I ever see it again, I can pay closer attention to the movie's plot and come to appreciate it a little bit more!

It was the first of it's kind with new and amazing camera and sound techniques. Though Welles acted in and directed in many other movies, Citizen Kane was and is the most famous.  None had the same impact as this movie. Was it the story line? Was it the innovative techniques? Or was it the controversy it created? All of those things rolled into one made a classic.    Citizen Kane was modeled after William Randolph Hearst, a famous publisher\/politician at the time. Hearst went to Harvard but was expelled and still went on to run his fathers newspaper (The San-Francisco Examiner). Although this movie is based on Hearst's life, in the beginning it shows that he was adopted by the bank basically because the mother didn't want control of their gold mine anymore and also because the father was potentially abusive.

There was Hugh Grant, this little boy I had never seen, and some women who fitted the chick flick criteria perfectly. In the end I backed my better judgement and decided to give the movie a go, but even though Grant was headlining I was still trepidacious.  About a Boy is exceptional, in not only its story telling and unravelling of the characters but in its balance between humour, sadness and interesting thought provoking points of view.  Grant plays Will, a self indulgent wannabe romeo, who spends his days using up 'units of time' as he puts it. In one of the funniest passages in the movie he describes this concept, and without delving into it too much he believes that he enjoys a perfect balance of relaxation and fun.  How can he do this you might ask; easy, you live off the royalties of your father's hit Christmas song.  He is convinced in himself, he knows what he is and what he wants to do and his pathway is clear of such daily obstacles like finance, trust, dependance and stress. He is complete.  But he's not of course.  Deep down he knows the shallowness of such an existance where the innocent daily ritual of watching quiz shows blends into his alter-ego nightlife.Void of any life variables he exists in his vacuum, until a twelve year old boy uncovers a sinister truth.  Will you see has been on the search for available women, and he uncovers a group whereby single mothers go to feel good about themselves and to relieve the stresses of total independence. He is the only male single parent in the group, and soon he weaves a web of deception about his very own son.  The women fall for it.  He is pleased with his efforts and another lie is notched onto his bedpost.  The movie gets going when Will and a mother from the group decide to meet, but she brings along with her the boy of another woman who has been ill.  From then on relationships are formed, dissolved, papered over and engineered.The movie was superb in almost every respect.  The directors needn't have looked no further than Grant, for if you want caddish charm and an air of unassured assurance, Grant is your man.  He is wonderful throughout.  The 'boy' in question is played brilliantly by Nicholas Hoult as Marcus, the son of a hippie type who cannot get to grips with the evolving millenium.  He doesn't seem like other kids and sometimes I wondered whether or not the movie would fob me off with another 'the underachieving nobody defeats all in the end' tagline.  To a tiny extent it does, but the story remains real and believable to itself which was refreshing.  And Toni Collete is also wonderful as Fiona, the depressive mother of Marcus.  Their love for each other is evident, but she frets that she cannot give the thing she cherishes the most the best in life.  Marcus doesn't mind, he just wants her to be there for him, although the inner rejection she feels for not being the perfect mother is sometimes too much to handle in some harrowing scenes.All of the other characters also played their parts extremely well.  It was an exciting and rivetting movie, that had its fair share of serious moments as well as some brilliantly executed comic scenes.  It is also deeply touching, with a sort of refreshing feel good factor that firmly bases itself on reality.  By that I mean that not all questions were answered, and that some aspects of life remain troubling.  The central combination of Will and Marcus worked splendidly as well.  Marcus' naivity and innocence was blended paradoxically with a kind of know how and some semblance of street wise occasionally.  Inquisitive and well meaning, the partnership forged between the two was entertaining if nothing else.  Watch it if you can, even if at first you have some reservations like me, because About a Boy is a genuinely terrific movie.  People grow, find a certain peace with themselves and along the way involve themselves in moments of comedy.  An excellent movie.

To confirm this unexplained impression I decided to watch it last week and found a film that, while quite enjoyable, doesn't really have too much going for it outside of some stereotypical Italian mama-mia charm.  The plot features a couple of tangled relationships - be they loving marriages, damaged marriages or affairs.  The plot doesn't really do much with any of the threads other than bring them all together towards the end, and, as a result, it heavily relies on the charm from the characters to carry it.  This it does pretty well and the characters are quite amusingly exaggerated or stereotyped (depending on your point of view).  Only Loretta and Cosmo really emerge as characters with a touch of reality to them.Cher does OK with her character and down plays it fairly well.  In contrast, Cage hams at any chance - he's the most tragic man i know comments a character and, boy, does Cage make sure that we never doubt the validity of that statement.  Gardenia is great as Loretta's father and produces one of the more subtle yet comic characters; Dukakis is also good as his wife.

It is actually a stylish mystery\/thriller\/actioner that moves beyond common cinematic structure and intelligently plays tricks on the audience.  The viewer is drawn into the helplessness of the protagonist (Kurt Russell) who is caught in a desperate surreal situation in which the unexplained disappearance of his wife provokes little or no reaction from the locals.  A police officer, responding to Russell's claim that his wife is missing or kidnapped, asks `is it possible she could have left you?'There are several sequences in which it initially appears that the story may be resorting to overused plot techniques when it is actually building on the audience's false expectations.  This arouses the viewer's interest in terms of where the plot is headed and leaves room for a great deal of speculation.Consider the following a long tension-filled camera shot of a truck slowing down in the distance, turning around, and coming to a complete stop suggesting that the occupants are refusing to forgive Russell for involving them in a near vehicular accident (never mind who's fault it would have been).  What were the occupants' intentions as they watched Russell from the distant truck?  An evil conspiracy (but what?) appears to be present in a small town (but who and how many?) which is backed up by the police (but is this actually true?).We meet a friendly good-ole-boy who stops his truck to offer Russell's wife a lift to the nearest towing facility after their vehicle breaks down and thirty minutes later mysteriously denies ever meeting them (was it a twin driving a similar truck?).  There's a complacent deputy, a dismissive bartender, and an alleged town idiot who provides questionable information and then appears to save Russell from an uncertain fate. This provides the movie with an effective Hitchcockian touch.  Just when the viewer is lulled into the belief that he has unraveled the mystery, the plot twists in a new direction and he realizes that, in this film, events do not unfold with anything resembling predictability.  Several ambiguous scenes only begin to make sense as the solid story gradually reveals itself.The portrayal of villainy in this film is utterly believable and delivered with a frighteningly raw intensity that far exceeds the usual contrived comic book evil of many films of this genre.  This leaves the viewer with a rather unsettled feeling of the evil people lurking in this world.I will admit that the climactic scenes at the film's end fall into the trap of satisfying the audience's usual desire for mindless entertainment but the action scenes are definitely well executed.  It has been stated that the final act of revenge was in poor taste but in forcing the viewer to confront man's inhumanity to man, it paints a vivid picture of the suffering that could have taken place earlier at the hands of the villains.

An evil conspiracy (but what?) appears to be present in a small town (but who and how many?) which is backed up by the police (but is this actually true?).We meet a friendly good-ole-boy who stops his truck to offer Russell's wife a lift to the nearest towing facility after their vehicle breaks down and thirty minutes later mysteriously denies ever meeting them (was it a twin driving a similar truck?).  There's a complacent deputy, a dismissive bartender, and an alleged town idiot who provides questionable information and then appears to save Russell from an uncertain fate. This provides the movie with an effective Hitchcockian touch.  Just when the viewer is lulled into the belief that he has unraveled the mystery, the plot twists in a new direction and he realizes that, in this film, events do not unfold with anything resembling predictability.  Several ambiguous scenes only begin to make sense as the solid story gradually reveals itself.The portrayal of villainy in this film is utterly believable and delivered with a frighteningly raw intensity that far exceeds the usual contrived comic book evil of many films of this genre.  This leaves the viewer with a rather unsettled feeling of the evil people lurking in this world.I will admit that the climactic scenes at the film's end fall into the trap of satisfying the audience's usual desire for mindless entertainment but the action scenes are definitely well executed.  It has been stated that the final act of revenge was in poor taste but in forcing the viewer to confront man's inhumanity to man, it paints a vivid picture of the suffering that could have taken place earlier at the hands of the villains.  Since entertainment is a necessary element in film, one could decide to label 'Breakdown' as a popcorn-chewing film and let it stand out as one of the best.*****\/5 stars  ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"13 November 2003","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  I'm a snob, and this movie started inauspiciously, I think, confirming my fears of a modern adaptation with popular actors.  It does use Shakespeare's language, with only a few words changed for the modern viewer, and the usual rearrangements and jettisonings.  And there are titles to explain the initial situation.  Eek!  Actually, the editing and the resetting of scenes is significant enough that we cannot anticipate the next line or even the next scene, and must look at the play with clean eyes, occasionally wide eyes.  This is a great benefit to those of us dangerously overfamiliar with the material.Much of the occurence does not make any sense in the '90s corporate setting. The language and personal relationships are likewise problematic, but the brain easily ignores such minor details.  Many lines are rushed through on metre and with no particular grace or expression.  This turns out okay in Hamlet since he is sort of depressed, thinking aloud, and... well, he's a blank slate, receiving all our interpretations instead of making his own, mostly reacting instead of acting.  Gray and vague like an Etch-a-Sketch, and like an Etch-a-Sketch, sometimes getting shaken up and losing his picture.  Um... He's also annoying, constantly watching black and white video clips on various monitors.  So, this is not as so often a piece centered about one star, it's more of an ensemble, the cast is quality to the smallest part.Ophelia is depicted with particular excellence, except she doesn't make sense.  To me, she never makes sense, unless she is just very simple, somewhat stupid, and dutiful.  I think this is a fault of the medium, I hate to say the play.  How can the full immensity, the emotional weight of these situations ever be depicted on stage or film? That lacking, our imaginations must supplement and engross their motives, or the characters become exaggerated, volatile charicatures of themselves, moving too slow or too soon, reacting in too great tenor. Ophelia's lover is mad - that's never depicted to my satisfaction. He must confuse her enough to make her willing to deceive him, and the stronger a character she's made, the higher a standard of motive is needed for her change.  Nonetheless, with this single inconsistency and a little perhaps excessive screaming forgiven, she is beautifully, strongly, and touchingly drawn.  No shrinking violet she, but a woman signified by water still and moving, pellucid, powerful, changing, falling...The Ghost is for once, more attractive than Claudius, aiding our accord and approval of Hamlet's obsessive grief.  Neither a terrifying nor an overwhelming, nor a pathetic figure, he is mostly human, and for that effective.  Laertes - oh, well done!  The grave scene achieves only an unsatisfying quiet pathos, but in all else, full of most excellent differences.  Liev Schreiber is perfectly cast, impulsive, capable of great emotion and violence, but basically warm-hearted.Claudius is unctuous, slightly sinister, appropriately threatening in a testosterone-y way.  Bill Murray's Polonius is undistinguished, no fault. Our Gertrude is lubricious and perhaps a lush, a wretched queen indeed, but she has her moment.This Hamlet, now.  He becomes most moving.  Moodier than other portrayals, yet he does not bore or disengage us.  Those annoying movies begin to be important and involving, not mere directorial flourishes. He's special.  This is a Prince trying to act, but then...  perhaps he has ADHD - he forgets his purpose.  It's tragic.  Also, one big problem - he's not really mad!  Hamlet in general plays more than is mad, though we debate to what extent.  But this Hamlet hardly even plays mad, making others' reactions to him not bear examination, but acceptable because we know the story, know that's what they do.  Likewise his play is too vague - we can understand the king's reaction, but would anyone else in the court understand?In fine, this is a most unusual, powerful, and moving production, due to depth of cast, the excellencies of particular interpretations, judicious editing and canny use of technology, which I hate to detail for fear of spoiling - I think some of the power owes also to the surprise of the edits and resettings.  Coming to this with an open mind, but not completely new eyes, I do not think it is logically complete, like the play within the play, it ought to be confusing without our prior knowledge.  Possibly I am wrong, even if not, it touches me not - I love the current film better than the other 5 or so Hamlets I have known.  A surpassing update.
