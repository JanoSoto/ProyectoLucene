[{"date":"5 July 2014","score":"","review":" seriously if you have not seen this film yet stop what you are doing, go down to wherever you buy DVDS from and pick this up then watch it and repeat. this movie is too intricate and complex to go into here but you are gripped throughout the whole film and the twist is the perfect payoff. just watch it and enjoy, because believe me you will. The characters are some of the most interesting and compelling i have ever seen in any kind of media, except perhaps Lester burnham from American beauty (another great film btw). the way they all fit into the overall plot and story is fantastic and the people who created this masterpiece should all be given huge praise for allowing me to watch the film and then afterwards sit through the credits with a huge smile.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"5 July 2014","score":"","review":" This was billed on the Movies! TV channel as a popcorn movie, and that it is. Nothing at all to take seriously, just a mostly fun B&W sci- fi movie typical of the 1950s.The first thing that struck me was the idea of a space mission to the planet Venus. The atmosphere at the surface of Venus exerts about the same pressure as being under water 3000 feet on Earth, a pressure that would crush most things. Plus the surface is generally in the 800 to 900 degree F range. A very inhospitable place, not likely ever to be visited.But this is a fantasy sci-fi story, I didn't get hung up on that very long and just went with it. To the credit of the writers they explained a few things to make it seem somewhat plausible.The movie starts with two men and a boy in a small fishing boat off Sicily. They look up to see a pointy spaceship in obvious distress that crash-lands into the sea, point down it remains afloat just long enough to let them rescue the commander and to see that there were few survivors.The young boy is a western and Texas fan, he wants a big hat and a horse, and finds things to sell to the local biologist to raise funds. Ashore he finds a USAF cylinder on land and, instead of revealing his discovery, takes the gelatinous contents to the biologist. Inside is the embryo of a creature from Venus which, after exposure to earth's atmosphere grows at a fantastically rapid rate. So much so that it cannot be contained and becomes a threat to all of Italy.As movies like this go the humans eventually figure out a way to prevail, in the meantime the entertainment is to see the monster wreak havoc and the Earthlings avoid death. The final scenes playing out in the ruins of an old Roman coliseum, military shooting big weapons at the now very large alien species. At the end one general says, Why is it so difficult to move from the present to the future? Definitely a B movie but entertaining as a representative of the 1950s sci-fi movies.
