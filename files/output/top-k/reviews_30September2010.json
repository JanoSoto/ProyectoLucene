It took a second viewing for me to really appreciate the film, but it really is a straight comedy spliced of course with sci-fi. The worm guys are probably the best characters in the whole movie, being so outspoken and well portrayed. The story is a brisk one, but it delivers nicely in my opinion. Perhaps many felt the empty feeling when the movie was over was that the story moves along way too quickly, and I suppose it could've been longer, but it does just fine.The action sequences are generally well done and each has their own bit of quirky comedy, which leads me to the alien designs which once again will definitely aspire a second look or two. One can really get a tone for the film by Danny Elfman's score, considering there is no real emotional strong point in the music; one can technically expect the same from the movie. While the sequel may lack some of the scares and better told mystery, it's still a enjoyable laugh.

Steven Spielberg is back and what we get is a mixed bag. I saw it as a kid and naturally loved it. But as we grow older, so do our knowledge and need for probing. Some cast members did not return and weren't even referenced to at all in the story but other aspects in this film make up for it. Jeff Goldblum does reprise his role and I'm quite happy about that. Julian Moore and Vince Vaughn star here, but to me the actor who really caught my eye was Pete Postlethwaite, as Roland. In terms of story this film was definitely built as a thriller. A lot of the story is non-sensible, as I'm sure you've read. The boat somehow guiding itself back to the exact spot where it was destined via no pilot (or maybe auto-pilot&#x85;), an experienced mercenary on an island full of flesh-eating dinosaurs wandering off just to take a leak, with Juan listening to his MP3 trying to catch a baby dinosaur when I'm sure you heard its enraged father is right behind him&#x85;eh, the list goes on give or take. Basically this purely a money-shot type of film. We do see a bit of a deeper side to Goldblum's character and that does add a bit of zest to it all. A lot of the other characters are mildly gone into, just barely enough to get a sense of who they are. But suckers like me to this day end up caring for them. Ha-ha Decent characterization at best.Once again a riveting score by John Willams, but in all fairness we get no real time to appreciate it. The SFX of course good as can possibly be, but we established that in the first movie. In America what movie doesn't have good SFX? That's why I don't care when people say Godzilla films SFX are terrible. Because I LOVE dinosaurs I give it a 7.9, around a near B-, but no doubt still a keeper by far. I proudly own the DVD as part of my collection.

When the film does move forward it's pretty interesting, the actor's all feel functional throughout and some of the characterisations can be interesting but really the film lacks a sense of suspense or horror for the main part. This eventually all leads up to a disappointing climax that doesn't feel choreographed properly and the great reveal moment for the monster comes across as a bit of a letdown, earlier in the film one of the characters describes the process of making it involved stitching limbs, injecting drugs before being followed up by horrific mutations however when it comes out it's a simple man with papier-mâché on his head type job. You could have said that this was to be expected but the movie really hyped up this moment throughout so it was deflating to see the actual creation.Overall The Brain That Wouldn't Die was lacking in real suspense or horror sequences and although it had interesting characters it lacked the payoff that was promised throughout the film.
