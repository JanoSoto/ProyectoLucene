As vibrant rock music plays at all the usual teen road movie signposts, their biggest problems at the moment seem to be Lewis (Paul Walker) trying to win the heart of longtime crush Venna (Leelee Sobieski - a dead ringer for Helen Hunt in both looks and voice) and his black sheep brother Fuller (Steve Zahn) who can't seem to stay out of jail. Yet something nasty happens on the way from college to home and soon their fun turns into a race to stay alive. 'Joy Ride' is both as naturalistic as horror thrillers get and as purely cinematic and absurd as movies get. The film is an invigorating gem that breaks the usual story form enough so you're never quite sure what will happen next. Now, really, how often does that happen? Especially in the horror genera.Billed as a typical teen slasher movie and sure to be touted by wannabe critics as a Duel rip-off, 'Joy Ride' is elevated above most of it's source material by a solid cast, attention to character and well developed, often funny, dialogue. Steve Zahn finds that perfect balance between frenzied oddball and appropriately subdued in his first lead role. Paul Walker is nicely cast in the role of an uptight, wooden jock being pushed to loosen up that effectively plays off his Keanu Reeves School of Acting abilities. J.J. Abrams' ('Alias') & and Clay Trevor's script gives a good amount of attention to the characters and their relationships. They seem to know each other before the movie began and aren't constantly consulting the script for their motivations. In the 3rd act, when the movie turns into a Rube Goldberg cartoon as our heroes race from one roadside motel to the next it's that great set-up and solid characters that let us take their hand and make the leaps in logic with them. Horror-maestro Marco Beltrami delivers one of his most memorable and effective scores in years. It goes wonderfully with director John Dahl's (Red Rock West) expert direction. His attention to atmosphere and ability to keep the screws tightening is commanding enough to pull the audience to the edge of our seats. Aside from the character development, Joy Ride distinguishes itself from the average slasher movie in that it is really about something, about the sometimes thoughtless way that people can treat each other when technology like the internet, phones or - in this case - a CB radio put barriers of anonymity between people. Our villain, going by his CB handle Rusty Nail, exercises revenge on our lovable anti-heroes not out of spite or evil, but loneliness and humiliation. He is a mortal lurking in shadow, but much of his existence is limited to a voice over a radio. He seems to have a God-like wrath and an omnipotent pool of knowledge to work with. And unlike the idiots that wander around and open doors when they aren't supposed to we actually root for Lewis, Fuller and Venna. The vehicles of terror, not the big rig as much as paintings, phones, gas stations and motels.All of this is grand fun and made even more precious by it's quick, barely 90 minute running time. It moves - gets in and gets out, cleverly sewing up itself up (those who think the end is a sequel set up clearly just don't get it) and leaving it's characters with their dignity. Joy Ride could have just as easily, and commercially, been the usual throw-away teen horror flick, but the care and attention put in by all involved raises it to a level at the top of the genera heap.

I was also intrigued by the film's handling of science and faith (read NOT religion), and the interesting juxtaposition of both by film's end. The first climax of the film, in which Jodie Foster as the brilliant Ellie Arroway makes an incredible journey, is eerily, achingly beautiful, followed quickly by the second climax of the film, Ellie's disquieting but deeply-felt epiphany. To say any more would ruin the story for those who have yet to see the movie. That said, Foster's performance was uncharacteristically out of focus &#150; she utilized one too many of her stock-in-trade 'pained and confused' facial expressions that read (at least to me) as if the character was constantly vacillating her position inside of her head, an attribute Ellie would decidedly not possess. Her gaze should have been straight-forward, determined, and unwavering. Matthew McConaughey as Palmer Joss was sincere but a little bit too hunky to be believable. A character bestowed with such a spectacular name would have been much more realistic if he had been played with the plain ambiguity of William H. Macy. Of course that would undermine the obligatory sexual tension and negate the fatuous 'romance,' a plot point that adds absolutely zilch to the story. Since the film indicates from the very start that it is in possession of a serious-minded agenda, I can only guess the producers felt the romance was either necessary to establish the frailty and humanity of Ellie, or, more likely, as a form of selling out, a pandering affect to draw in a larger audience. Stock characters rounding out the film, portrayed by Tom Skerritt, James Woods, David Morse, and William Fichtner (and a teeny-weeny role by Rob Lowe), are solid and well-done. **SMALL SPOILER** The character of S. R. Hadden, played with straight-faced solemnity by John Hurt, might have looked good on paper, but comes off as unintentionally, embarrassingly hilarious. As the obscenely wealthy benefactor who assists Ellie in her quest, he is first seen in his private jet, which he keeps in constant flight, presumably landing only to refuel before soaring off again (okay, I can suspend my disbelief long enough to buy that). But when next Hadden contacts Ellie, it is, unbelievably, ridiculously, from aboard the space station Mir -- the gentleman is now apparently cancer-ridden and prolonging his now-tenuous life in outer space. Nothing else in the entire film stretches credulity more than this; it is shocking in its absurdity. **END SPOILER** After all is said and done, I gave 'Contact' 8 out of 10 points.

A character bestowed with such a spectacular name would have been much more realistic if he had been played with the plain ambiguity of William H. Macy. Of course that would undermine the obligatory sexual tension and negate the fatuous 'romance,' a plot point that adds absolutely zilch to the story. Since the film indicates from the very start that it is in possession of a serious-minded agenda, I can only guess the producers felt the romance was either necessary to establish the frailty and humanity of Ellie, or, more likely, as a form of selling out, a pandering affect to draw in a larger audience. Stock characters rounding out the film, portrayed by Tom Skerritt, James Woods, David Morse, and William Fichtner (and a teeny-weeny role by Rob Lowe), are solid and well-done. **SMALL SPOILER** The character of S. R. Hadden, played with straight-faced solemnity by John Hurt, might have looked good on paper, but comes off as unintentionally, embarrassingly hilarious. As the obscenely wealthy benefactor who assists Ellie in her quest, he is first seen in his private jet, which he keeps in constant flight, presumably landing only to refuel before soaring off again (okay, I can suspend my disbelief long enough to buy that). But when next Hadden contacts Ellie, it is, unbelievably, ridiculously, from aboard the space station Mir -- the gentleman is now apparently cancer-ridden and prolonging his now-tenuous life in outer space. Nothing else in the entire film stretches credulity more than this; it is shocking in its absurdity. **END SPOILER** After all is said and done, I gave 'Contact' 8 out of 10 points. If for no other reason, the film's beginning and ending are worth alone the price of admission (or rental, as it were).

Along with films like Last Tango in Paris, The Night Porter is a story about a very implausible encounter between 2 people who willingly descend into self-destructive behavior and death. The story involves a female Holocaust-survivor who accidentally reunites with a man who used to be a Nazi guard at her concentration-camp, and who had sexually tormented her. But we're to believe that she actually loved this man, and fondly remembers his sexual exploitation of her in the camp, portrayed through many flashbacks. The very idea of this occurring in real life defies belief, but perhaps that's not the point. I assume the director, who is a woman, wants the viewer to accept the scenario as-is and then ponder the many gray areas of sexual morality and emotional bondage between men and women, and then question the dark side of the soul and where it leads us if we explore its power too deeply. I assume the film's nihilistic ending is the director's answer to these questions.The film's pace is very ponderous and pensive, with long periods of silence and wordless flashbacks to the Holocaust. The film is very moody, includes some very pretty Classical music scores, and the camera frames scenes with may creative angles and reflections. Charlotte Rampling is really quite good in her role as the Holocaust survivor. Most people remember her topless dance in one of her flashbacks, where she dances seductively for several Nazi officers, but it's actually quite tastefully done, filmed as an odd analogy of the New Testament story of Salome's Last Dance. It's probably one her best roles, despite the unbelievable context.This film is very much part of that genre of early 1970's films known today as Cinema of Alienation. The early 70's was a time of some pretty serious artistic Angst, which is a mindset that can sometimes produce very powerful art. The film's ending would never get past Hollywood today, since American audiences are supposed to walk out of theaters feeling happy and secure, not disturbed.I recommend the film. It will linger in your mind for quite a while. But it's not a date-movie, so choose your co-viewers wisely.

Pierce Brosnan returned in his third outing as James Bond, acclaimed dramatic director Michael Apted took his place behind the cameras, and Neal Purvis and Robert Wade were assigned to write the screenplay. After two very Connery-esque outings as Bond, one of which was not a Bond film, Brosnan has a chance to be in the most Fleming-esque Bond since LTK...even if he must continue to be the next Sean Connery. TWINE is easily the greatest of Brosnan's four 007 films as of yet and the fourth greatest of all the Bond films, surpassed only by ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, LICENCE TO KILL, and THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS.The film has a very unique cinematic look to it that no other Bond has had; it is the darkest of all the films. The locations are exotic but very real; you would never guess that the nuclear site or the Maiden's Tower were sets at Pinewood studios. Almost every character is given incredible detail, humanity, and in some cases, pity. This was Brosnan's best outing as Bond, and despite he keeps being confined to a Connery style Bond and doesn't quite handle his few Dalton moments, he does a fantastic job. M for once is given a major role in the storyline, and Judi Dench excels in these scenes. Tanner, Moneypenny, and Robinson all return doing a fantastic job. A new character, Q's assistant R, is hilarious. And Desmond Llewelyn gives his final outing as Q. The final moments that 007 and Q have together are wonderfully written and acted. Llewelyn was the longest lasting member of the original team of writers, actors, directors, and producers on the Bond film and his untimely demise in a car accident following this film was truly upsetting. Ms, Moneypennys, and Bonds can come and go, but for some reason, there can be only one Q. RIP Desmond, and thanks for all the memories.For the first time ever in a Bond film, a woman is the main villain. Elektra King is one of the most complex, ambitious, and truly evil of all the Bond villains and may very well be the best of them, if not the best of the women; that honor still goes to Bond's wife Tracy (a comment by Elektra makes reference to her). Kidnapped by the terrorist Renard, her father and M had no choice but to refuse to pay her ransom due to policy. So Elektra seduced her captor. She made him fall madly in love with her. He allowed her to escape, and she damaged herself when Renard couldn't bring himself to do it. Deceiving everyone, she had her own father, oil tycoon Sir Robert King, murdered by a bomb exploded in MI6 headquarters. Elektra has a great power over men, especially womanizers like 007. She deceives him as well, and by the time he figures it out, Elektra captures M, buys a nuclear submarine, and arranges to cause a nuclear holocaust to gain control over the world through the oil market. Her evil nature and deceiving all that cared about her makes her a truly nasty character, and when Bond kills her in cold blood, it's hard to surpess a cheer. Her lover, Renard, is definately the most human of all Bond's villains. With an excellent actor in the role, Renard attracts a great deal of pity. With Alec Trevelyan of GOLDENEYE, you felt sympathy for him, but the fact he was also doing this to get rich lowered the abbility for the audience to feel sorry for him. Renard, however, is doing all his actions due to blind love. Seduced and used by the woman he captured and held for ransom, Renard has a bullet in his head killing off his senses, so far making it impossible for him to feel pain or anything else. This frustrates him greatly as he cannot be a good lover to Elektra. This character's blind love for Elektra (he's willing to commit suicide so she can make millions) and the fact that, to her, Renard was merely another employee and tool, makes it hard not to pity this poor, deceived, blinded man. Even Bond seems to pity him; before Elektra's scheme is thwarted and Renard is killed, the two share sympathetic smiles.As the darkest, most dramatic, and most intense of all the Bond films, there is a great need for comic relief, and it comes in good supply without ruining the tone of the film. Valentine Zukovsky of GOLDENEYE returns with a much more friendly attitude towards Bond. Prior to Bond' involvement, he arranges to get her a nuclear submarine, commanded by his nephew Nikolai, for $1,000,000. He is unaware of the purpose, of M's kidnapping, or that Elektra is working with Renard. When Bond informs him (and when Elektra kills his nephew and destroys his caviar factory), Zukovsky joins Bond, and his final act before being killed by Elektra is to save Bond's life. Both 007 and the audience feel grief for his death, as he is one of the most amusing and charming characters ever to appear in a Bond film. Zukovsky's traitorous henchman Bull, played by Goldie, is another amusing character. The final comic dose, R, bumbles his way through demonstrating all of Bond's gadgets, all the while being insulted by Q.The film's title, The World Is Not Enough, is the Bond family motto, as revealed in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. The previously mentioned reference to Tracy and the ski chase pay homage to that film. Despite the excellent story and characters, there are problems with this film. Bond hardly uses his car. Zukovsky should not have been killed. And the Bond woman in this film, Dr. Christmas Jones, is the only character that is poory written. A typical bland Bond girl, she is too young to be an expert in nuclear physics and is rather unconvincingly portrayed. She serves no point to the story at all and is merely added in so that Bond can bed a woman at the end (does anyone else grow tired of this ending?). And once again, as good as this film was, it is truly disappointing they could not let Brosnan for once play the Dalton\/Fleming-type Bond he has been wanting to do ever since he took the role.With 8 out of 10 stars, this is Brosnan's greatest contribution to the series. This film is so great because it is the only Brosnan Bond film to have the feel of a Cubby Broccoli 007 film, and that is something special.

We are therefore shown the Third Reich in all its dark and loony glory, in all its bloodthirsty expansionist policy and inhuman treatment of `sub-humans'.Chaplin's rendition of Hynkel is masterfully put forward as jibberish, with dramatic poses and movements that include him pouring water down his pants.

A direct parody of the appeasement policy and the breaking of the Stresa front, Chaplin does not only have a go at Nazi Germany, but also at the people that just let it happen.Chaplin's final speech in which the Jewish barber takes the place of Hynkel, questioning Hitler's own Arianness, is filled with a plea to the world to stop war forever instead of simply saying that the world should stop the Nazis. This film should be compulsory in every country and in every school and the fact that the world is still embroiled in wars all over shows that this film is perhaps more relevant today than it was in 1940.

As far as her subdued, passive demeanor in the film, I feel it was in keeping with her character An abandoned lonely child carrying those wounds into adulthood. The plot made sense, and I also enjoyed her romance with Julian Dice Black. Their chemistry was believable and there were many bittersweet, poignant scenes where Dice saw the real girl and her pain. The fact that he is shot near the end really saddened me, especially since we were not able to see how far their relationship could go. Such as, though his love for Billy was genuine, could he have gotten over his jealousy of her success (which he believed in and helped to create)? Especially when he was feeling the pressure of failure in his own eyes? His drum and piano riffs were awesome. He must be a true musician in the real world.

The part where Jack is changing the little kids diaper. And also when he takes his child to the day care.  If you want a comedy out of this movie your not going to get it.

I usually hate movies that are really funny but get way to dramatic. This movie, though, I thought was great. Since my parent's are really strict on movies. This was one of the first PG-13 rated movies I had seen. I saw It in the theaters with my dad when I was like 11. It was one of my dads favorite movies. We own It now.  This movie start out focusing on the life of a single man (Jack), who is rich, who has left his girlfriend and told her he would come back after a year in his new job. He dos'nt come back after a year.  So.......... one day Jack wakes up. On Christmas. With kids jumping on him yelling Dad. And a lady right next to him (Kate).

We had exhausted my DVD library, when I stumbled upon a Blockbuster previously viewed copy of Joe Somebody. We figured that it had to provide us with a smorgsaborg of laughs, chuckles and guffaws. When the movie was over we all felt absolutely drained of life, the very ambition to continue moving and breathing having been sucked right out of us.First of all, the George S. Clinton score is quite something to contemplate. The opening credits sequence that seems to go on for a good fifteen minutes is scored with a monotonous and repetitive piano flourish. Apparently the director felt this little loop of music was applicable to any situation in the movie which leads to the music's gross overuse.I can't emphasize enough how badly done this movie is. I don't mean this in an ignorant, this is a pg kids movies, I wont even give it a chance, I mean that every aspect of this movie is ham-handedly done. I have nothing against Tim ALlen or any of his fellow actors in this movie, but as I watch it I can hear the ignorant, dumbassed direction that was given to these people. Obvioulsly a talentless, hack amateur directed this movie, and I feel that I can say this safely without having ever met the guy. Each scene the actors are trying to capture a certain emotional response without any sense of context. It gives the impression that every character is bi-polar. Also, there are several subplots that are introduced throughout the film and just when you think that the movie will do the smart thing and start picking up these threads, they go nowhere.I can only recommend this movie for the disturbingly surreal scene in which Tim Allen taps his scrotum with a 'squash' rackett, revealing that his balls are literally made of steel.

Q. again tonight and had forgotten how much I love this movie.  It is wonderfully entertaining and leaves you feeling that all is right with the world.  I love the allusions to Mozart all throughout from the opening with Einstein playing Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star on the violin to him humming Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during the IQ testing of the Ed Walters.  I love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career, an especially unique situation for the 1950's, the time in which this movie is set.  (I myself have been a teacher but stayed at home to raise my children, so please don't think I am some staunch women's libber.) It's wonderful how a man who is only a grease monkey is finally seen to be just as important and worthy as Catherine's fiance, a clinical behavioral researcher.  The message to me is that we are not what we do, but who we are is defined by so much more - no labels.  There are so many little gags and one-liners that are almost throwaways if you don't watch and listen carefully.I did catch a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page. In the scene when Ed Walters is to speak at symposium, there are 3 instruments (protractor, ruler, etc.) hanging on the right from the chalk ledge.  In the next camera shot, there only 2.  In the credits on our video, it lists Tony Shaloub's character as Bob Watters, not Bob Rosetti as he introduces himself in the movie and is listed here on Imdb.I highly recommend this movie.  It may be a piece of fluff in some estimations, but has lots more substance than many give it credit for. Not only that, what a great cast is assembled here.  Watch it and enjoy!
