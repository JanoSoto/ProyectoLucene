This movie is a good one to think where we can really hold the line but not to sacrifice too much our joyful and of course moral sense. The most important is freedom.  From my point, this can never be satisfied without certain rules applied. Imagined that if our new generations can behave like in this movie, this world can never have a chance to get worse. On the other hand, we should have a simple living environment. When people don't have not much choices to make, life can be easier.

No. Hmmmm. Hauer is one of my favorite actors and stars in two of my top ten favorite movies (Blade Runner and The Osterman Weekend), so it's hard not to already be slightly biased about the movie. I remember first hearing about Nighthawks on the Headliners and Legends biography of Stallone and how it was not as well received as his Rocky and First Blood movies. For shame, because Nighthawks does manage to be a top notch thriller most of the time. I could go into the plot, but I believe in telling people what I liked and disliked instead of parroting the plot details like almost every other review. (See, a movie to me is more fun when I only know a little about the story, instead of the first hour or so, because someone felt that they had to readers digest the entire film.)Anyway, now that I've ranted, I have to admit that I enjoyed it for the most part, with the exception of the initial pacing. It continues to drag in places towards the middle, and takes a little over an hour to set up the crucial players backgrounds. The only real problem is that every time the film stops to focus on DeSilva (Stallone) and Fox (Williams), it spends twice as much time focusing on Wulfgar. Wulfgar is certainly a well crafted maniac, but when the movie is over we know almost nothing about Fox and only a little about Dee DeSilva. Still, the movie does succeed in making you care about our two main characters, by thrusting them into danger and having them do what is morally right (i.e. Towards the beginning of the film the two are in a drug raid, and refuse to take bribes from the perps who had apparently already paid off the cops from the first raid on their operation.They're good cops, and it's their good guy image that endears them). I guess it would have been nice also to see a little more of Stallones relation to what's her name. (sorry, I haven't seen this in a about a month now.) I was interested in the prospect of a hero who was torn between the relation with his ex (who he was trying to re-ignite the flame with), and his duty. But, alas, she was just a narrative device who the writers have decided is only important in the last 15 minutes or so.With all these cons, why did I still like it? Sudden scenes of high impact, good cast and acting all around, a villain who wasn't just a cardboard cutout, and Stallone's bitchin' beard, and a wholly convincing scenario.The bottom line This film is more akin to The French Connection than it is to Rocky.

And each and every one of them is right on the mark. You might be surprised to hear this, but I'd still recommend seeing EXORCIST II THE HERETIC, and especially if you enjoyed the original; it's such a jaw-droppingly awful abomination that you need to see it in order to believe it. What the hell were they all thinking? How do you follow up one of the scariest and most powerful box office horror classics with this type of garbage? You know you're in a heap of trouble when you've got actors like Richard Burton, Louise Fletcher and James Earl Jones and it turns out to be Kitty Winn (as Sharon) who gives the only credible performance. Linda Blair is terrible as Regan too, but nobody was expecting anything earth shattering from her anyway. It's so much fun to trash this movie. There are so many areas to tear apart that one doesn't know where to begin. The script is utterly implausible and plays like the stuff born out of a bad acid trip where someone fried his mind the night before, wrote the film while tripping under the notion that he's found the key to life itself, and then awakens the next morning in a pool of vomit with no recollection and just a piece of paper with chicken scratch that he can't even read himself. There doesn't seem to be any point to the goings-on, and whatever plot can be surmised at all is ludicrous and confusing. The film is dumb, pointless, boring, badly acted, abysmally directed, and NON-FRIGHTENING. Idiotic dialogue abounds everywhere (Kokumo? Pazuzu?) and the music score from the great Ennio Morricone is stillborn.I've mentioned the poor acting, but I must devote a paragraph alone to Louise Fletcher (who had just won the Best Actress award for ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST).

Then I grew up and found out it was all a big contrivance.  It almost quashed my love for this movie.But the truth did not succeed to extinguish my love.  The entertainment value of this movie is astounding and sometimes thrilling - but the historical value is so misguided that it almost ruins it for me.  I now feel that, though this movie makes a sham of history - - it is a great showcase for the wonderful talents of Michael Curtiz, Errol Flynn, Ronald Reagan and Olivia de Havilland.I particularly love the final rescue scene.  It is choreographed and orchestrated so beautifully, it is hard not to be taken into the maelstrom of John Brown's destiny.  Those battle trumpets still cause a chill to go up my spine.Before I was old enough to understand the true nature of this tale, I visited Harper's Ferry and felt an honest chill when I visited the firehouse where John Brown and his men were captured. I touched the walls and stood in awe at being so close to such a fateful edifice. It is now called John Brown's Fort because he was holed up in there for three days in October 1859.  So close before the fateful Civil War embroiled our nation in its saddest chapter.  But the building was a fire engine and guard house when it was built in 1848 and moved to Boston for display and then later, back to Harper's Ferry to a place about 150 feet east of its original location.  The original location had become a railroad embankment...so it could not stand at the original spot.Whatever you think about the historical inaccuracies of this film, its entertainment values are excellent for their own sake.RAYMOND MASSEY is especially memorable as John Brown.  His earnest and single-minded portrayal of a madman-with-a-quest is the great stand-out of this movie.  The far-away gaze and fiery eyes are almost hypnotic in its concentration. I also enjoyed watching Ronald Reagan and Errol Flynn do their stuff as no one else can.  These are actors that for better or worse will always stand out from the Hollywood fray with their own special brand of something indescribable and timeless.Watch this movie with a grain or two or historical salt.

When the Pitch Black - Unrated Director's Cut DVD was released just a few months ago as to rake in pennies from the inevitable hype for The Chronicles of Riddick, my interest was renewed.Chronicles chronicled the downfall of summer movies (I wasn't going to see it anyway, but the free ticket that came with the Pitch Black DVD burned a whole in my wallet; plus the movie was dumbed down to PG-13 from an original R rating, meaning that more scenes of character development and graphic violence were removed to cater to teenage fanboys). The best thing to be said about Chronicles really, was that the production design and visual effects were quite impressive.Pitch Black offers something more in the way of characters, that you actually care about them and when you rooted for that bad ass Riddick (Vin Diesel), those feelings were genuine. You actually got scared when all the lights went out and the small band of survivors led by Riddick and the unwilling captain of the downed spaceship (Radha Mitchell) had to make it to safety in total blackness because bloodthirsty, nocturnal creatures were on their tail the whole time.The director, David N.

While I fully support the B picture industry for keeping slobs like Michael Dudikoff in work, a little work on the product would have gone a long way.For those who give a rat's posterior, my next few paragraphs will give away significant parts of the plot.First of all, when we are given some background information on the titular hero, we are told his date of birth, next of kin, parents, and so forth, are all unknown.

More recent films such as The Matrix Reloaded defy this convention, but just about every film from the 1980s has the audience screaming, hey, why don't you attack all at once???. Martial arts films tend to be a lot more impressive when the fights are more extensive than one-on-one.The central premise was originally a joke, but in light of recent events where the US army cannot crush a mob of insurgents simply because they won't delegate to the specialists, it seems strangely ironic. Phillipino renegades are stealing weapons from the US army's local division for sale to wealthy clients. Never mind that such a theft would prompt the army to give the local businessmen responsible, or even believed responsible, an aerial rectal exam, this is a cheesy 1980s action film, after all.By far the funniest part of the film is the climactic battle, however. As Joe and Jackson turn combining posing and fighting into an art form, evil Ninjas start to explode for no readily apparent reason. I agree with one previous commentator in that this film should have been called Ninja Holocaust, because I'm willing to bet a total of at least three hundred evil Ninjas bite it during the film's running time. On top of that, the Black Star Ninja starts fighting with rocket launchers, laser beams, and all sorts of ridiculous implements that are not only poorly thought out, they're flat-out poorly executed. You'll never see a laser beam effect that looks cheaper.What tops it all off is that the film takes itself so damned seriously. During the scene when Joe is meeting up again with his old mentor, I dare the viewer not to laugh at the hideous dialogue. Not that I know any modern practioners of Ninjitsu, but the logical part of my imagination has a hard time believing that they have spoken like this at any time in their history.

If it's scares and an economy of production values you crave, nothing beats this film's bar-brawl scene, a scene so stunning in its savagery you'll remember that you are indeed watching a vampire movie where nice people die (as opposed to The Lost Boys rowdy teens who have it coming anyway).

If you feel the same way about the older films I don't think you can go wrong with this one. I believe You've Got Mail is a remake(even though slightly different and also a very enjoyable film.) of this film. For a relaxing evening with a movie you don't have to be ashamed of if your kids or anyone walks in on your viewing, get this,or catch it on one of the classic movie channels.

This is not a good movie by any means but it has positive things to underline. First, Wahlberg and Whiterspoon can act and their performances are the best thing about the movie. Milano is a delight to watch even that she's not very required in the movie but still shines in the few minutes she appears. Second and best of all; Fear goes directly to the point and makes it very easy to watch. *SPOILERS* There's nothing much to comment about Fear except for some infamous scenes like the dog's head, the drilling in the hand, and the three sex scenes.There are some Slasher elements a la Scream in this movie that in the time were very effective (stabbing, dog's head cut off, minimal gore, and a psycho killer) and worked very well in order to create a tense atmosphere. The ending is quite predictable and expected. The actors they chose perform surprisingly good. If the plot is not very interesting then the least you can expect is to feel some sympathy for the characters. Whiterspoon is tender and beautiful and you totally believe her when she has different feelings for her boyfriend. Wahlberg delivers a good performance as a crazed angry boyfriend. Come on, everybody feels anger jealous acts... this is exactly where I think that Fear succeeds. The movie is directed to a teenager audience that immediately feels similarities in their personal life with the events of it. The movie works in that aspect and there's no question about it.Watch it with minimal expectations and you will be surprised maybe a little.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 August 2004","score":"15 out of 22 people found the following review useful","review":" Fear is a teen thriller with no intentions others than entertain the audience and show good looking teen stars like Mark Wahlberg, Reese Whiterspoon, and the always lovely Alyssa Milano.

It just oozes this dark, creepy atmosphere. So, no complaints in the visual department.The plot has been widely criticized, but I don't see what all the fuss is about. Most people I talked to who didn't like it, automatically assumed that all the supernatural things that happen in this film, actually happen. A bold assumption, given the fact that we learn very early on that the main characters perception of reality isn't exactly trustworthy. And when we find out that most of the evil omens were brought about by a demonic sect that wants their dark messiah, it makes the Peter=Satan prophecy very much a self-fulfilling one. So, is Satan really coming or is this just a lot of superstition? In fact, the film tries very hard to keep both options open right to the end, and my only real complaint is that it didn't fully succeed. A few things remain unexplained by main character hallucination and the doings of a bunch of wacky satanists (mainly the silent tape and the crucifix falling over). This is bad because it forces the movie to acknowledge the supernatural. If it had been able to maintain deniability, it would have been brilliant.I'm not a particular fan of the genre, so I can't say much about originality. It is a very slow paced film though, and most of the suspense has to come from the ongoing theme Is he, or is he not the antichrist. People who automatically assume the latter, are very likely to be bored. But I didn't, and so I wasn't. So I think this film is very good. If not for the flaws I just mentioned, it could have been a classic screw-with-your-mind movie, like The Usual Suspects, The Others or ExistenZ.
