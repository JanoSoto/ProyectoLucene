After leaving, they take family hostage, a once-preacher father and his son and daughter. They make them a deal, stay with them until coming dawn and they will be released unharmed. They hole up for the night in a back-roads bar just over the Mexican border. Unknown to them though, they will soon be fighting for their lives against the bar's real owners, a group of vampires with a taste for blood and gore.This is a joint film between Quentin Tarentino, the creator of such classics as Pulp Fiction and later Kill Bill, and Robert Rodriguez, the creator of El Mariachi and later Sin City. With Rodriguez directing and Tarentino writing, producing and acting, this film is a force to be reckoned with. The script is classic Tarentino, with references to other cult classics, his own and others, and the dialogue is flawless in getting us close to the characters. The style of Desperado and El Mariachi is seen here too and shows why Rodriguez is one of the most coveted directors in Hollywood.The acting next to the crew is what really gets this film going. In the opening scene alone, a Texas Ranger played by Michael Park shows what real acting is in his short role of only a few minutes. George Clooney and Tarentino as the convicts play off each other well with Clooney being the quick-witted professional and Tarentino playing his younger brother with a psychopath hiding beneath the surface. Tarentino plays his role well, but Clooney shines as Seth Gecko with classic one-liners and acting ability. Harvey Keitel is great as the preacher father who lost his faith in God and Juliette Lewis as his daughter shows acting potential as well. Smaller roles by Fred Williamson and make-up artist Tom Savini do not go unnoticed either.This movie is almost two films in one as the opening half gets us into the characters and the second being a twist into horror as the characters fight for their lives against the vampires. People may find that one half suits them better than the other, but no matter what, Rodriguez, Tarentino and the actors take us for a ride that few will forget.

They start out on high notes with THE FORTUNE COOKIE and THE ODD COUPLE and then make a couple of comedies again with Billy Wilder together (one is Wilder's version of THE FRONT PAGE) which are not well received. They also do a film KOTCH, where Matthau stars in a straight role as a lively octogenarian, and Lemmon directs him (for his only time as a film director). But while they remained close friends Lemmon and Matthau did not seem to consider making any further films together without Billy Wilder. Fans of Crosby and Hope always mourned the failure (before Bing Crosby's death) that plans for a film THE ROAD TO TOMORROW were never completed. Fans of Martin and Lewis always hoped that the supposedly ill feelings between the men would settle and they would do one more film together. This was not the case with Matthau and Lemmon. Both men were such highly capable actors and comedians the public did not need them to resume another joint venture.Then, in the 1990s, they did a large spurt of films together. Two of these, GRUMPY OLD MEN and GRUMPIER OLD MEN, were excellent comedies. Another, THE GRASS HARP, was a straight film in which they shared only one scene together, but was generally well received. Then came OUT TO SEA and THE ODD COUPLE II. The former was a funny film, but lacked the strength of the GRUMPY movies, and the latter was a film with some good moments in it, but it can't stand good comparison with the original THE ODD COUPLE. This is, therefore, the only film comedy partnership which might have faded without any real notice. The revival of it was one that amazed the public in the early 1990s, and helped push the remaining three films into some form of box office success. I think the reason is that, although with Crosby and Hope their individual films in their heyday of the 1930s to 1950s were highly popular, there was a definite different element to their joint ventures two friends not taking plot, characters, or even Dorothy Lamour too seriously, but just trying to top each others zingers and turn a movie upside. With Lemmon and Matthau, their screen chemistry was quite good, and (judging from the outtakes in GRUMPY OLD MEN) they did not take their films that seriously either, but the stories had to make enough sense for their acting skills to carry scenes where they weren't reacting together.In GRUMPY OLD MEN, look at the scenes with Arial (Ann-Margaret), where there is one on one with John (Lemmon) or Max (Matthau). They are all acting very natural and well together. They behave like regular people interacting. The same with the scenes with Darryl Hannah, or with Kevin Pollak, Ossie Davis, Buck Henry, and Burgess Meredith. There is no false notes among them. In one scene, Ossie Davis (Chuck) has heard what a free spirit Arial is from Lemmon and Matthau. He goes, on Thanksgiving, to visit her - suddenly the two grumps have a rival. They confront him the next day. Davis is not a wooden stick but a very lively actor, and he gives as good as he gets from the two stars. He announces that the experience was like an awakening of youth. Suddenly one feels the presence of Davis' Purley Victorious just for a moment, but you see it is a natural reaction. Now compare that with Hope and Crosby confronting anyone else in their Road pictures. Or Martin and Lewis in their films (with Laurel & Hardy one hesitates, as Jimmy Finleyson or Charlie Hall or Mae Busch would react naturally). Hope and Crosby \/ or Martin and Lewis would confront wooden characters who were stooges or villains. Shortly afterward Davis' character dies. Matthau learns of it from Lemmon, and has an argument with Lemmon about not showing proper respect to the dead. Matthau returns to his home, and picks up a cap from Chuck's bait shop. And he starts crying for his dead friend. Nothing like that ever occurs in Hope and Crosby films, or Martin and Lewis films, or the other pure comedy teams.The film is basically about the long standing hurts that mar what is actually a friendship between Lemmon and Matthau going back to their childhoods. The final blow is basically the arrival of Ann-Margaret, and who will she favor as the future second wife of (or in Matthau's case, third wife of). She has an interesting character too, a California free spirit of artistic interests, who teaches literature. Given the stodgy middle age qualities of the two leads (well mirrored in the winter world of snow around the town of Warbisha), she is like fresh breezes of ozone. The other performers are good too, including Darryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as the children of Lemmon and Matthau who their fathers (for all their mock-feuding) would like to see together, Davis (the first of two films he did with Matthau - the other is I'M NOT RAPPAPORT), Buck Henry as the obnoxious IRS man Snyder, and best of all, the late Burgess Meredith as a sensible, horny 90 year plus father to Lemmon. Meredith was the first of the leads of this film to die, but (fortunately) he lived long enough to help in the sequel, GRUMPIER OLD MEN).

You could just agree to all the bad critics that have been written about it &#150; that Better than chocolate is nothing more but a cliché and an unrealistic fairy tale. Fairy tale's the word What is cinema supposed to be if not a fairy tale? It's unrealistic; it helps us forgetting our daily troubles and allows us to dream and to bathe in romantic feelings. And these are exactly the reasons I recommend Better than chocolate and think that it's a splendid movie, a hilarious comedy and a love story so sweet you just get enchanted by it.It's a classic The sweet princess, Meggie, just quit university and preferred becoming part of Vancouver's gay scene, performing in a gay bar (and she's so great in it!) and working in a lesbian book store. Things seem to go pretty fine until the day when Maggie's Mum Lila calls and informs our princess that she just left her current husband and wants to move in with Maggie, bringing Maggie's teen brother Paul with her. The problem is Mum doesn't know (or doesn't want to know) that her little daughter is gay. Things get even more problematic when one night, after her performing at the club, Maggie meets her knight, who does not wear an armour or ride a white horse, but who is an attractive, tough and cool girl named Kim, rides a funky van and lives on the road, earning her money with drawing portraits. When all the characters mentioned above finally find themselves living under the same roof some days later, things become chaotic and almost grotesque cause it's so obvious that Kim and Meggie are a couple but Lila is simply blind for it.Mind you, the movie also deals with other interesting characters. We get to know Frances, the neurotic owner of the book shop Maggie works in. There is also Judy, who once was Jeremy, but now is a woman and hopelessly in love with Frances. And don't forget Carla, whose favourite pass of time is sex, who seduces almost every person crossing her way, is an expert in the newest *toys* and digs on Maggie as well as her brother Paul.Of course it's one or two clichés, I mentioned it before. But if you see how lightly and heart-warmingly the story is told, if you hear the hilarious jokes and one-liners, follow the soft filming of the camera you just can't help forgetting about those clichés and falling in love with this movie. For in the middle of this colourful chaos the love story between Kim and Maggie is the calm and comforting pole, it's told in silent pictures and gentle sounds (which become a bit louder when it comes to &#133; well, the making love part). And this beautiful love story has highlights of its own, and I don't want to reveal even one of them. I can only say that much A lot of colour and &#133; goddesses ;) (everyone who's seen the movie of course knows what I'm talking about) There is also something else I love about this film Although it's a fairy tale and most parts of it are simply utopic, Better than chocolate can be inspiring and show possibilities The possibility of an alternative life style and that you can be comfortable with it, no matter what others might think, the possibility to break out of certain expectations society burdens us with and the possibility to love differently. For example when Maggie quits her finance studies to live her dream of being an author. So, besides allowing us to dream, this film also gives incredible hope and this might be its greatest strength.A word on the cast which is simply &#150; brilliant. And before concentrating on one of the protagonists, who in my opinion stood out, I'd like to compliment the others. There is this young actor playing Paul, who up to Better than chocolate has had no acting experience but is very good at what he's doing. There is the sex-ridden but likable Carla. The neurotic Frances &#150; Canada's currently probably most famous lesbian actress and author Ann-Marie MacDonald (and according to director Anne Wheeler the only openly gay actress participating in this movie). The icing on the cake in this film are two profound Canadian actors &#150; Wendy Crewson as Lila and Peter Outerbridge as Judy. Wendy (who is probably most familiar as Harrison Ford's wife in Air Force One) is just outstanding as the confused, sweet and clueless Mum with a weakness for chocolate. Peter Outerbridge is just incredible as Judy and you really have a hard time to believe that this is his first transsexual performance &#150; he's so great in this role and just a beautiful woman. And now let me point out the person who impressed me most with her performance Christina Cox as Kim. She's hot, she's sexy, she's tough and cool but at the same time so soft and feminine. I think only few actresses can add so many different facets to their role. I mean, she could have easily played a simple butch, but she adds such charisma and dignity to her character &#150; it's just amazing. There, enough said, she's just great. The movie's soundtrack is a highlight of its own &#150; Sarah McLachlan with Ice Cream for example &#150; and perfectly mirrors the film's young spirit, it's modern, it's sexy, it's dreamy and it rocks.

These guys have such appealing chutzpah together and twinkle along with preposterous schemes and grandiose impulses, and they have a kind of honor about friendship and loyalty.

The spare and very straight-line novel by Matt Helm creator Donald Hamilton suggested these qualities, but fundamentally it was the interposing of a strangely-whole personality, a self-asserting sea captain, into a long-standing feud between two allegorical and implacable western rivals. One was the hard-bitten owner of Ladder ranch, a self-made touchy New England type with a stuck-up family and proud ranch hands; the other was the intelligent patriarch of a brawling clan of Soiuthern-style culturally-backward lower-class types. The narrative that Hamilton developed from this set of elements was not voluminous either. The captain comes to marry the girl he had met, the ranch-owner's daughter. He is kidnapped by the Southerner's boys and hoorahed. The ranch owner is furious about this and takes his revenge on those responsible. While th captain and the girl, who expects him to act like a westerner and take his licks publicly, have their own misunderstanding, the Southerner warns the ranch owner never to intrude in his area, Blanco Canyon, again, on pain of starting a war. The captain ignores advice about how big the land is and, using a compass, he tames an unbreakable horse by dint of falling off over and over again, but with no one to see except a Mexican hostler. He then rides bent on discovery but meets Julie Maragon, who owns the Big Muddy section, once a worthwhile ranch; and on his return has to fight the foreman who calls him a liar when he says he had not been lost--he what been heading back to the ranch when they found him. The fight is a respectful draw; it turns out the foreman wants to marry the daughter. Then the remainder of the film involves three actions. The ranch owner attacks the Blanco Canyon gang on a pretext, and he and the Southertner kill each other in a duel to the death. The girl refuses the captain; and he has already decided to marry Julie, daughter of the former owner of the strategic Big Muddy section, and allow water rights to both sides, ending the pretext for their long quarrel; this leaves the daughter free to marry the foreman. Jerome Moross did intelligent and spacious-sounding music to accompany this long and interesting character drama on horseback. William Wyler directed lyrically with a real sense of space, from a script adapted by Jessamyn West and Robert Wyler, with the script being finished by veteran writers Sy Bartlett and Robert Wilder and James R. Webb. Franz. F. Planer did the crystal-clear cinematography, with art direction by Frank Hotaling. The set decoration was done very opulently by Edward G. Boyle with costumes being designed by Emile Santiago and Yvonne Wood. This was a feature produced for himself by Gregory Peck with Wyler. He is excellent in the lead as James McKay, sea captain. The rival heads of he outfits were played by Charles Bickford and Burl Ives, both giving award caliber performances. Jean Simmons and Carroll Baker played Julie Maragon and the fiancée-daughter,respectively, with Charlton Heston as the foreman Steve Leach, Chuck Connors' as the Southerner's rebellious son, and veteran Alfonso Bedoya as the Mexican who befriends McKay. No one else in this very clear and ruthlessly-developed film is given very much to do. Some of the sense of a fatal conflict stems from this portrayal of opposing forces moving toward a confrontation neither admits they want but which they do too little to avoid. The director makes a strange choice as Peck discovers the old house on the Maragon property; he suddenly shoots the scene from Julie's point of view; I believe this to have been an tactical weakening of the film's progress, but the viewer must judge whether it serves Julie's introduction better than conventional point of view would have done. But there are a great many virtues to this consistently-stylish production. Some are the dialogue scenes between Peck and Carroll Baker, the arguments between Ives and Bickford, and the pacing of the entire film, which is deliberate where it is made to be deliberate and is caused to proceed swiftly where it must. This is a very good drama masquerading as a western; and it seems to me clearly to be an allegory of what caused the civil War, played out on the Texas plains with the addition of a man of Lincolnesque un-common sense set into the middle of the tense situation. It is also the last film Wyler directed before the mammoth mounting of Ben-Hur.

One was the hard-bitten owner of Ladder ranch, a self-made touchy New England type with a stuck-up family and proud ranch hands; the other was the intelligent patriarch of a brawling clan of Soiuthern-style culturally-backward lower-class types. The narrative that Hamilton developed from this set of elements was not voluminous either. The captain comes to marry the girl he had met, the ranch-owner's daughter. He is kidnapped by the Southerner's boys and hoorahed. The ranch owner is furious about this and takes his revenge on those responsible. While th captain and the girl, who expects him to act like a westerner and take his licks publicly, have their own misunderstanding, the Southerner warns the ranch owner never to intrude in his area, Blanco Canyon, again, on pain of starting a war. The captain ignores advice about how big the land is and, using a compass, he tames an unbreakable horse by dint of falling off over and over again, but with no one to see except a Mexican hostler. He then rides bent on discovery but meets Julie Maragon, who owns the Big Muddy section, once a worthwhile ranch; and on his return has to fight the foreman who calls him a liar when he says he had not been lost--he what been heading back to the ranch when they found him. The fight is a respectful draw; it turns out the foreman wants to marry the daughter. Then the remainder of the film involves three actions. The ranch owner attacks the Blanco Canyon gang on a pretext, and he and the Southertner kill each other in a duel to the death. The girl refuses the captain; and he has already decided to marry Julie, daughter of the former owner of the strategic Big Muddy section, and allow water rights to both sides, ending the pretext for their long quarrel; this leaves the daughter free to marry the foreman. Jerome Moross did intelligent and spacious-sounding music to accompany this long and interesting character drama on horseback. William Wyler directed lyrically with a real sense of space, from a script adapted by Jessamyn West and Robert Wyler, with the script being finished by veteran writers Sy Bartlett and Robert Wilder and James R. Webb. Franz. F. Planer did the crystal-clear cinematography, with art direction by Frank Hotaling. The set decoration was done very opulently by Edward G. Boyle with costumes being designed by Emile Santiago and Yvonne Wood. This was a feature produced for himself by Gregory Peck with Wyler. He is excellent in the lead as James McKay, sea captain. The rival heads of he outfits were played by Charles Bickford and Burl Ives, both giving award caliber performances. Jean Simmons and Carroll Baker played Julie Maragon and the fiancée-daughter,respectively, with Charlton Heston as the foreman Steve Leach, Chuck Connors' as the Southerner's rebellious son, and veteran Alfonso Bedoya as the Mexican who befriends McKay. No one else in this very clear and ruthlessly-developed film is given very much to do. Some of the sense of a fatal conflict stems from this portrayal of opposing forces moving toward a confrontation neither admits they want but which they do too little to avoid. The director makes a strange choice as Peck discovers the old house on the Maragon property; he suddenly shoots the scene from Julie's point of view; I believe this to have been an tactical weakening of the film's progress, but the viewer must judge whether it serves Julie's introduction better than conventional point of view would have done. But there are a great many virtues to this consistently-stylish production. Some are the dialogue scenes between Peck and Carroll Baker, the arguments between Ives and Bickford, and the pacing of the entire film, which is deliberate where it is made to be deliberate and is caused to proceed swiftly where it must. This is a very good drama masquerading as a western; and it seems to me clearly to be an allegory of what caused the civil War, played out on the Texas plains with the addition of a man of Lincolnesque un-common sense set into the middle of the tense situation. It is also the last film Wyler directed before the mammoth mounting of Ben-Hur. Highly recommended.     ","genre":"Romance, Western"},{"date":"24 July 2005","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a spacious film, with very-wide vistas, the distant horizons of a Southwestern landscape tall skies and copper-colored air.

However, in spite of it's two enormously annoying leads, this film works as a thought-provoking drama, a tour de force of outstanding special effects and a pitch black comedy. While the film has several fundamental flaws, director Robert Zemeckis manages to mask them adequately by way of lots of ingenuity with the plot, his two strong leads and the flashy special effects. The story sees an aging actress (Streep) and her mortal enemy; the same woman whose husband she stole (Hawn) taking a magical potion that will allow them to stay young for all eternity. This puts the unfortunate man of the story (Bruce Willis) in a very miserable situation, as he finds himself in the middle of the feud between the two ladies, which worsens still when it turns out the women need his skills with plastic surgery to stay looking good.The story allows for some very striking special effects, as the two female leads are pushed down stairs, have their heads turned 360 degrees, get blown apart with a shotgun and more. While the story could have done with being a little more expansive; it basically holds the story together well, and always ensures that the film is lots of fun. The leads obviously enjoy themselves also, and while I'm certainly not a fan of the female stars; both fit their characters excellently. Bruce Willis is the standout of the cast for me. He takes on a role that is the exact opposite of the one in Die Hard that made him famous, and proves that he can do more than just standard action fare. The beautiful Isabella Rossellini rounds off a nice cast; and she is always a pleasure to see. The humour mostly emancipates from the neurotic characters that Streep and Hawn have been given, and seeing the two bitch at each other is usually entertaining. The film is full of comments on society, the never-ending quest for beauty and the female persona in general; but on top of all that, and more importantly, it makes for top class entertainment.

Jack and Karen hit it off big time, despite being on opposite sides of the law, but a bungled robbery at a rich man's house in Detroit pits them against each other. Will love overcome business differences ? A well-made, sassy, punchy crime-thriller based on one of Elmore Leonard's great pulp crime novels, this movie is a bit schizophrenic. Half of it is hard-as-nails bad-boy action, with Clooney as a latter-day Cagney, busting heads and trading quips. The other half is a smoochy romantic pot-boiler with him in his more familiar Cary Grant persona. It's good, but he's a bit sappy at times (unlike, say, Chili Palmer in Get Shorty, which was made by the same writer and producers), which dissipates the tension and pads it out a bit much for my liking. Lopez is good too, cool and remote, with too much attitude and lipstick, but she's not quite in the Lana Turner \/ Barbara Stanwyck league. Scott Frank's screenplay is full of quotable dialogue and the film does not want for style; there is particularly brilliant editing by Anne V. Coates, with plenty of aptly-placed fades and jump-stills. I'm not quite sure why I didn't like this movie more - it's got plenty of pedigree and all the performances are good, particularly Cheadle as the scary but dumb-as-a-box-of-rocks gangster. I think it's really just because I didn't know who to identify with; Jack and Karen are pretty slick but they're a bit too perfect and untouchable at the same time. Well worth a viewing though.

Before long Madeline has stolen Ernest from Helen & they are married. Years later & Helen is an overweight emotional mess who blames Madeline for all her troubles & sets out to gain revenge. Now living together in a mansion in Beverly Hills Madeline is ageing fast & Ernest is nothing but a glorified undertaker these days & deeply unhappy with his life & his marriage to Madeline. One morning Madeline receives a invitation from Helen to the launch party of her latest book. The same morning Madeline is told that she cannot have anymore of her surgical beauty treatments for 6 months but is also secretly told to see a woman named Lisal Von Rhoman (Isabella Rossellini) who may be able to help. At the party Helen turns up & is beautiful, looks young & has a terrific body. Madeline is jealous & Ernest is attracted to her, Helen starts to manipulate Madeline & Ernest to set her plans in motion. After Madeline's younger lover Dakota (Adam Storke) dumps her she decides to visit Lisal. Madeline drives to the address she was given, a huge Gothic cross between a mansion & castle where Lisal gives her a potion which reverses the ageing process & will make her forever young. Lisal gives Madeline a specific warning to care of her body as they will be together for a long time. Meanwhile Ernest & Helen plot to murder Madeline. Soon after Madeline falls down the stairs & breaks her neck but doesn't die, Ernest touches her up with spray paint as her body starts to decay & fall to pieces. Helen turns up & when Madeline discovers the plot to kill her she grabs a shotgun & blasts Helen but she too doesn't stay dead for long...Co-produced & directed by Robert Zemeckis I think Death Becomes Her is a wonderful black comedy which has become a personal favourite of mine. The script by Martin Donovan & David Koepp is fast paced, dark, very funny, original & presents the most bizarre love triangle in film history! The Hollywood satire hits the nail on the head & is clearly there for all to see with vain, rich & famous celebrities living obsession with looking young, thin & beautiful. I really like all the characters in Death Becomes Her especially Bruce Willis as the dumb founded man caught in the middle & Goldie Hawn as the vicious scheming jilted lover, although everyone has personality. Full of witty one-liners, great visual gags & some nice irony thrown into the mix Death Becomes Her is a tremendously entertaining film that I have seen many times & enjoyed each & every time. I think the climax is terrific as well & round the film off perfectly. Director Zemeckis has fun with creating some memorable CGI effects, Streep with her head twisted backwards & my personal favourite Hawn with a huge hole in her stomach you can look right through. The violence is more slapstick in style than sadistic & contain little in the way of actual explicit blood or gore. Having said that there is a fair amount of bad language throughout so maybe it's not suitable for very young children. The acting is great from everyone Willis & Hawn in particular as I've mentioned, everyone has good on screen chemistry in my humble opinion. Oh, am I the only one who thinks Goldie Hawn looks fantastic & very sexy in this, even with a huge hole in her stomach?! Technically death Becomes Her is great as well, well for around $55,000,000 that's the least I'd expect. From the wonderful looking & atmospheric sets to the special effects to the cinematography where Zemeckis thankfully uses lots of nice long fluid smooth elegant camera movements & pans rather than ugly quick cuts & zooms that tend to be the norm these days. I love Death Becomes Her, it's one of my favourite family horror\/fantasy films that's incredibly funny, works as satire very well & has a top-notch cast who are hopefully having as much fun as I was, it has some terrific effects that aren't quite as convincing as todays mega budget films but they are striking & stay with you. I don't really have a bad word to say about this film! Highly recommended, so what are you waiting for? If you've never seen it make sure you do as soon as possible & if you have make sure you remind yourself of it's brilliantness soon!

Full of witty one-liners, great visual gags & some nice irony thrown into the mix Death Becomes Her is a tremendously entertaining film that I have seen many times & enjoyed each & every time. I think the climax is terrific as well & round the film off perfectly. Director Zemeckis has fun with creating some memorable CGI effects, Streep with her head twisted backwards & my personal favourite Hawn with a huge hole in her stomach you can look right through. The violence is more slapstick in style than sadistic & contain little in the way of actual explicit blood or gore. Having said that there is a fair amount of bad language throughout so maybe it's not suitable for very young children. The acting is great from everyone Willis & Hawn in particular as I've mentioned, everyone has good on screen chemistry in my humble opinion. Oh, am I the only one who thinks Goldie Hawn looks fantastic & very sexy in this, even with a huge hole in her stomach?! Technically death Becomes Her is great as well, well for around $55,000,000 that's the least I'd expect. From the wonderful looking & atmospheric sets to the special effects to the cinematography where Zemeckis thankfully uses lots of nice long fluid smooth elegant camera movements & pans rather than ugly quick cuts & zooms that tend to be the norm these days. I love Death Becomes Her, it's one of my favourite family horror\/fantasy films that's incredibly funny, works as satire very well & has a top-notch cast who are hopefully having as much fun as I was, it has some terrific effects that aren't quite as convincing as todays mega budget films but they are striking & stay with you. I don't really have a bad word to say about this film! Highly recommended, so what are you waiting for? If you've never seen it make sure you do as soon as possible & if you have make sure you remind yourself of it's brilliantness soon!

One of Madeline's friends an author named Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn) & her fiancé a talented plastic surgeon named Dr. Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis) visits her backstage. Before long Madeline has stolen Ernest from Helen & they are married. Years later & Helen is an overweight emotional mess who blames Madeline for all her troubles & sets out to gain revenge. Now living together in a mansion in Beverly Hills Madeline is ageing fast & Ernest is nothing but a glorified undertaker these days & deeply unhappy with his life & his marriage to Madeline. One morning Madeline receives a invitation from Helen to the launch party of her latest book. The same morning Madeline is told that she cannot have anymore of her surgical beauty treatments for 6 months but is also secretly told to see a woman named Lisal Von Rhoman (Isabella Rossellini) who may be able to help. At the party Helen turns up & is beautiful, looks young & has a terrific body. Madeline is jealous & Ernest is attracted to her, Helen starts to manipulate Madeline & Ernest to set her plans in motion. After Madeline's younger lover Dakota (Adam Storke) dumps her she decides to visit Lisal. Madeline drives to the address she was given, a huge Gothic cross between a mansion & castle where Lisal gives her a potion which reverses the ageing process & will make her forever young. Lisal gives Madeline a specific warning to care of her body as they will be together for a long time. Meanwhile Ernest & Helen plot to murder Madeline. Soon after Madeline falls down the stairs & breaks her neck but doesn't die, Ernest touches her up with spray paint as her body starts to decay & fall to pieces. Helen turns up & when Madeline discovers the plot to kill her she grabs a shotgun & blasts Helen but she too doesn't stay dead for long...Co-produced & directed by Robert Zemeckis I think Death Becomes Her is a wonderful black comedy which has become a personal favourite of mine. The script by Martin Donovan & David Koepp is fast paced, dark, very funny, original & presents the most bizarre love triangle in film history! The Hollywood satire hits the nail on the head & is clearly there for all to see with vain, rich & famous celebrities living obsession with looking young, thin & beautiful.

His solitude is soon interrupted however by ghostly phenomena; weird banging sounds, a walled-up room and a vision of a dead child. Convinced he is not imagining anything, Russell resolves to uncover the history of the house in an effort to explain its haunted qualities.This is one of the best ghost stories ever filmed, a true spine-chiller if ever there was one. If you don't experience sweaty palms, sudden chills and the hairs on your skin prickling on viewing this terrific Canadian horror movie, then check into your local morgue now because you're already dead. Gifted Hungarian director Medak has created a suspenseful, mysterious and nerve-shreddingly frightening film in the subtle tradition of The Haunting and Curse Of The Demon. The creepy house story itself is quite familiar but the context of the haunting, involving an unspeakable murder of a crippled child for both financial and political gain is truly original and fascinating. Investigating the mystery, Scott gives a dogmatic powerhouse performance (ably supported by real-life wife Van DeVere) that sweeps you into the mystery and lends the supernatural events tremendous authenticity. It's impossible not to admire his character's dignity and tenacity; when the local town gossip and a bullying cop try to frighten and intimidate him into abandoning the case, it only strengthens his resolve to find out more. The house is a stunning piece of set design, labyrinthine and darkly-lit with mysterious hallways spiralling up to unknown realms, and there is fantastic use of sound-effects to convey its gloominess and tragedy, as well as a great piano score by Rick Wilkins. Perhaps best of all in a near-flawless film is John Coquillon's stunning photography, which is delicate, unhurried, polished and amazingly unsettling, selling the movie's many great scares with shot-perfect precision (for other examples of his great skill as a cameraman, check out Sam Peckinpah's Cross Of Iron or The Osterman Weekend). An unmissable treat for anyone who has ever enjoyed a good tale to curdle the blood, and if you haven't, it's about time you started.

The face of L'Oreal 2001, I gather. I wonder how they got her to keep her head still long enough for the photos? This film may well have stalled her movie career, but at least she got three hours for her showreel.The supporting cast are pretty good on the whole; Jake Weber makes the ridiculous maguffin about the company takeover almost credible.

And the character's obviously gay; they could have ramped that up. Even the outrageous Bill-Joe relationship is not commented on by supposedly high-powered executives. Brad's too pretty!The main plot about Death hanging about the old man gives you enough to think about to sustain your interest (kinda Bergman) until the immeasurably tedious and tacky party sequence.

It isn't often that a 9-year-old girl can make me cry at will, but that scene after icing her arm in the dugout makes me cry every time. Kelly Leak, the ultimate stud player. If he hits, they win. His defense makes up for a weak overall team concept, and his hitting would be the best on any team, much less the one that didn't have a hit at all through their first two games. Miguel was best known for his walk just before the final at-bat for Kelly. Come on, a cute little kid that is barely the height of the catcher while kneeling? That bat is twice the size of him...he alternates between looking helpless and trying to look mean during the at-bat. Ahmed was just a stereotypical black kid using lines like sucker and Allah, so I didn't much care for him...But I loved him beating out the bunt. Rudy Stein...Um...Maybe they should NEVER let him pitch. He makes okay contact at the plate I guess...Note that he gets hit by a pitch in both of the first two movies, and his face in the second movie after getting hit is priceless...Looks like he knew it was happening and is melancholic. Reggie Tower...He plays third...Makes a play or two and pumps his fist. Important to the movie though, because his dad puts pressure on him to play. Important aspect to consider. Engleberg is a fat loudmouth, perfect for catcher. Eats throughout movie...Probably dies before Bears II, so they recast another fat kid for the role. I couldn't really tell. Same role really, didn't much matter. Ogilvie...Brain of team...Well, until Bears III where some new kid takes over. Does bad job too. DOn't bother looking up Bears go to Japan, terrible movie that features Tony Curtis and has a team as a side-note. Bears II Breaking Training is good, any kid would like it. Compare it to Meatballs or something, like a camp movie where kids are in control. Tanner Boyle. Best character in movie...Glaring gap in Bears III by his absence.

Timmy Lupus, shy kid with no friends. Wins over Tanner, but already had won over Toby Whitewood who sort of defended him FROM Tanner until that point. Makes the catch...And that look on his face is priceless. The little speech before he takes the field that inning shows how he is a team player. Ogilvie too, I should add. Wonder if there is some reason that Amanda had to stay in game. The kids he yanked kept saying that they could be put back in, yet Amanda couldn't be switched for one? Seems unfair, but that gave us the line at the end where she asked Buttermaker to teach her to hit next year. Stein trying for 2 bases? Something wrong there...Ogilvie is the brain obviously, if you happened to mix them up. Toby is better in Bears II, as are most of the players. Well, they get more screen time.

Wonder if there is some reason that Amanda had to stay in game. The kids he yanked kept saying that they could be put back in, yet Amanda couldn't be switched for one? Seems unfair, but that gave us the line at the end where she asked Buttermaker to teach her to hit next year. Stein trying for 2 bases? Something wrong there...Ogilvie is the brain obviously, if you happened to mix them up. Toby is better in Bears II, as are most of the players. Well, they get more screen time.

Tatum O'Neal was the perfect Amanda, pitching- and acting-wise. Great actress, she delivered the lines perfectly. It isn't often that a 9-year-old girl can make me cry at will, but that scene after icing her arm in the dugout makes me cry every time. Kelly Leak, the ultimate stud player. If he hits, they win. His defense makes up for a weak overall team concept, and his hitting would be the best on any team, much less the one that didn't have a hit at all through their first two games. Miguel was best known for his walk just before the final at-bat for Kelly. Come on, a cute little kid that is barely the height of the catcher while kneeling? That bat is twice the size of him...he alternates between looking helpless and trying to look mean during the at-bat. Ahmed was just a stereotypical black kid using lines like sucker and Allah, so I didn't much care for him...But I loved him beating out the bunt. Rudy Stein...Um...Maybe they should NEVER let him pitch. He makes okay contact at the plate I guess...Note that he gets hit by a pitch in both of the first two movies, and his face in the second movie after getting hit is priceless...Looks like he knew it was happening and is melancholic. Reggie Tower...He plays third...Makes a play or two and pumps his fist. Important to the movie though, because his dad puts pressure on him to play. Important aspect to consider. Engleberg is a fat loudmouth, perfect for catcher. Eats throughout movie...Probably dies before Bears II, so they recast another fat kid for the role. I couldn't really tell. Same role really, didn't much matter. Ogilvie...Brain of team...Well, until Bears III where some new kid takes over. Does bad job too. DOn't bother looking up Bears go to Japan, terrible movie that features Tony Curtis and has a team as a side-note. Bears II Breaking Training is good, any kid would like it. Compare it to Meatballs or something, like a camp movie where kids are in control. Tanner Boyle. Best character in movie...Glaring gap in Bears III by his absence. Absolutely MADE the series and story work. Okay, he curses more than everyone else in movie. Thinks PC is Piece of Crap. Fights anyone and everyone. Rebel, says wrong thing, can't play defense for anything. He is heart of team, and the leader. Kelly can hit and play D, but he is the oldest and their role model...Amanda was the core of their success as well, so she was important...But Tanner was a misfit like the rest of them, and he stood up for Timmy. Stood up for the team...Defended Amanda...Come on, took on the seventh grade alone. Buttermaker yanks him in final inning, and he gripes, and then turns around and inspires Rudy to get out there and do his best. Inspires them in Bears II, win 1 for the Looper. Timmy Lupus, shy kid with no friends. Wins over Tanner, but already had won over Toby Whitewood who sort of defended him FROM Tanner until that point.

They found one property, THE GRASS HARP, where they shared one scene together. But then this film was made which was fully their film together. Like most of their films Lemmon is the quiet partner who is dragged into the troublesome situation by the noisy partner Matthau. Here they are brother-in-laws (Matthau's sister, who is dead). Matthau convinces Lemmon that he needs to take a sea cruise to end his long period of mourning. Lemmon does not realize that Matthau got them free passage by signing them onto the cruise as social dancers (partners for elderly lady passengers). Lemmon can dance, but Matthau cannot, and one scene has Lemmon trying to teach Matthau, only to be caught by Donald O'Connor and Hal Linden dancing together (O'Connor and Linden jumping to the wrong conclusion). If they can't pull their weight as social dancers, they will have to pay the $1,500.00 per person fare as travelers. Neither can afford that. Matthau really could not care much about this - he hopes that he will be lucky to find, romance, and marry a wealthy woman. Lemmon is encouraged to do the same, but he is not as mercenary. As it turns out Lemmon does meet Gloria De Haven, and Matthau meets Dyan Cannon (and her mother, Elaine Stritch). But the course to true love is never smooth in movies. Matthau has a rival for Cannon, in Edward Mulhare. And Brent Spiner, the cruise entertainment director, is an evil martinet determined to impress the cruise line owner (Rue McLanahan) to put him in control of all the cruise ship's entertainment centers.It is a well-cast film, which helps (this is reminiscent of the two Grumpies films that preceded it. But those films had better balance to them. They had moments of pathos where one could see Lemmon and Matthau were not just funny men but human types. Here Lemmon is shown to have such a weakness - he has romanced De Haven in spite of his qualms, but at a critical point remembers his deep love for his first wife. But Matthau's personality is so mercenary (a cousin to his Whiplash Willie Gingrich in THE FORTUNE COOKIE), that his turning into a legitimate lover of Cannon doesn't quite sit well. Nor does it sit well when we find other likable characters can be equally mercenary.However there are plenty of great moments in the film. Spiner's unplanned involvement with a colorful local parade is one. So is Matthau's ridiculous dance with Rue McLanahan that looks atrocious (he calls his non-steps, the crawl)but that she enjoys. Spiner, better known as Mr. Data the android in STAR TREK, THE NEXT GENERATION, turns in a fine comic villain performance. My only criticism is that Linden and O'Connor seem too peripheral in the plot (although both do give filler about the ruthlessness of Spiner, whom Linden really dislikes). But the film is still very amusing, and worth while seeing. Unfortunately it was not their final film. That would be THE ODD COUPLE II.

This movie has three stories and a wraparound story. Here's the plot. It's an average day and we see Elizabeth(Harry) walking down the street with groceries. She talks to the priest and to her neighbors. Little do they know that when she gets home, she plans on cooking and eating a poor little boy, Timmy(Lawerence). She gets home, but he stalls her cooking by telling her a story from a book that she gave him(Tales from the Darkside).Story one Lot 49. Edward Bellingham(Buscemi) has just gotten a package that he ordered....lot 49. His....ahem....friend Andy(Slater) and Andy's friend Lee help him open it and it's a mummy. This is easy to figure out who will live or die, but the end was a surprise. Wraparound Elizibeth has just cut the vegetable and is almost ready to eat. He convinces her not yet.Story two Cat from Hell. Let me just say, this is my least favorite of the four stories(including the wraparound). A hit-man, Halsten(Johanssen) is hired by a wheelchaired old man named Drogan(Hickey). Drogan wants Halsten to kill his cat...because he believes that the cat had killed his two sisters and his butler. Halsten soon realizes that this cat is hard to kill. Easily the darkest of the three stories and also the most predictable.Wraparound Elizibeth is now ready to eat...but it's still 30 minutes until the oven is pre-heated. Timmy tells her one last story.Story 3 Lovers Vow. A struggling artist(Remar) gets a call and goes to a bar. His lawyer(Robert Klein) is there and tells him that he quits. Remar gets drunk and the bartender is going to give him a ride home. When they get out there, a strange creature cuts, then knocks the bartender's head off. Remar swears that if it doesn't kill him, he'll never tell anyone. After clawing him, the creature leaves. He runs to get a cab, but instead runs into a woman(Rae Dawn Chong). He tells her to stay with him, because it's dangerous out. They have sex and soon get married and have two kids. His art career also started to succeed, so his lawyer came back. Finally...it tears him up inside to have shared everything with his wife except for what he saw...so he tells her. Another surprise ending.....probably the best of the three.Wraparound (SPOILER) Timmy is ready to tell her more stories, but she's ready to eat. He then starts telling his story of how he got here and Elizabeth spouts,You don't need to tell me this one. We both know how it ends. Timmy tells what he's going to do. He pulls marbles out of his pocket and she trips on them and falls on the gutters behind her and trys to pull them out. Meanwhile, Timmy is locked in a dungeon, but he reaches the key and shoves her in the oven.
