[{"date":"17 November 2007","score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Election is far from a great film, certainly not as great as many fans proclaimed it to be upon original release. Many people have realized that since it came out, and it seems the public opinion of the film has slipped considerably. My view is somewhere in between. There are a wealth of problems in Election. However, when compared to the other high school comedies such as the abyssal American Pie series, it runs rings around its competitors. The humor is much darker and more cynical than a simple plot explanation would suggest. The film tackles taboo subjects such as pedophilia, yet its handling never comes across as tasteless or cheap.The performances in the film are what make it work ultimately. Matthew Broderick is an actor thats likable yet with a seemingly limited range. However, he manages to create a sympathetic character. Even better is Reese Witherspoon. As an actress, Witherspoon is only as good as the material. Shes been stuck in a lot of crap like Legally Blond and Cruel Intentions. However, if shes given a good screenplay such as this or the one in Walk the Line, she can be quite impressive.Still, the film is deeply flawed. The use of multiple narrators as usual doesn't work. Also, many of the supporting characters (such as the lesbian high school outsider) aren't developed enough to be as compelling as they're initially presented. Also, while I appreciate the films use of darker and more cynical humor, there's a shortage of actual belly laughs in it. But, like I said above, its far better than it has any right to be.
