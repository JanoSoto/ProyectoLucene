The Doom Generation stays with you for a long time due to a calculated slickness, painfully missed by practically all the demanding viewers and reviewers who simply couldn't understand the director's proposition with this apparently misguided, twisted violent film. News Flash it's a spoof!The target here is not only the violent action\/thriller flicks but also the satires made on those films such as the time very fresh Natural Born Killers, from which borrow its storyline structure of following a criminal couple on the loose. Well, a little different, perhaps. A young couple (Rose McGowan and James Duval) is involved in a series of crimes after bumping into a mysterious drifter (Johnathon Schaech) who reveals to be a complete psychopath who kills everyone on their way. Or better saying, everyone on the girl's way cause she's like a magnet for trouble, and all the strange, dangerous and demented people they meet claim to had known her (it has some Scott Pilgrim feels and that way before its creation). Next thing you know, the nice trio of troubled misfits are deeply involved as friends, sexual partners with some love\/hate in between and adding more and more crimes and victims on their run. Hollywood and its entertainment products for the masses dispose their garbage at us every year with plenty of movies that are pointless, with no good plots, using of sometimes excessive and most of the time pointless violence, all which later is labeled as entertainment, fun for all the family. Ever since the 1970's, and the trend is still strong. This movie is simply poking fun at their schemes, so Araki couldn't miss with this and he made something ten thousand times better than all those lousy films ever made. And it was more than criticism, it was a fun experience. Insanely weird but fun and pure 1990's. And graciously well-acted. The wild group is explosive, sexy, funny, just wished the director would stop with the tease between James and Johnathon and let them do something (the sexual tension between these two is just...you must see it!). The majority complains of poor line delivery, terrible script and acting, tasteless movie. Not at all. It's all calculated to appear that way but it's far from being a despicable work.

A film that blurs the borders of dreaming and challenges us to question the differences between reality, dreams, fantasies and nightmares. Sometimes it's just as weird to be awake as it is to dream.Dr. William Harford - played brilliant here by Tom Cruise in a role that might very well be the best he has ever done - flees from his house after hearing a jarring confession from his wife. And thus begins the long night that would haunt him forever.What makes this film so perfect is Kubrick's vision. The pace is so agonizingly slow, the plot so nonsensical, that had it not had one of the best directors of all time at the steering wheel, it would fallen straight to that pile of artsy borefests that only film majors ever watch. But it doesn't. Yes, it's slow, yes it makes no sense whatsoever, but yet it works. I remember glancing at the clock after the film had been going on for a while and I remember asking Has it really been two hours already? Because it didn't feel like it had. The film is hypnotizing. It pulls you in and as Harford wanders around New York, you remain strangely calm about the whole situation. You don't question, why was that character there, why did that scene happen. It just does, it's cool.Part of that calmness comes from the technical side of this film. Kubrick didn't want to use any studio lighting, so instead the crew relied mostly on the various Christmas decorations that they places strategically all over the sets. This gives the film a slightly blurred, soft and ethereal quality, not unlike if you were dreaming the whole time. The soundtrack is also amazingly powerful, underlining each scene with a heavy hand, but never in a way that feels forced. One of the few films where I noticed the sound cues and didn't hate them.I already praised Tom Cruise, but it's also worth noticing that despite this film having huge piles of gratuitous nudity, despite the infamous orgy scene, despite all these weird sexual situations Harford finds himself in, the sexiest thing in the entire film is his wife (Nicole Kidman) leaning against the doorframe in her nightclothes or peering over her glasses. That's talent on Kidman's part and the fact is helped alone by her and Cruise's marriage at the time. They have fantastic chemistry together and Kidman provides us with the needed reality and anchorage.Pretty much the only thing keeping this film from becoming one of my personal favourites is the fact that the ending drags. Not a huge amount, but it does. At that point the musical cues have begun to grow on your nerves, the slow scenes have slipped back into being agonizing and you just want the film to give you its final words and leave you to ponder its mysteries. Instead we get one final conversation before the ending scene between Cruise and Kidman. It doesn't ruin the film for me, but it's a shame that such a great film falters just before the finish line.Still, it's an amazing film. Heavily sexual, but not in a sexy way, it's a journey like you've never taken before. Riddled with phenomenal acting performances, with fantastic production values, ironhand directing and unforgettable scenes, it's a film you're going to remember. May it haunt your fantasies and deepest nightmares.

This movie is apparently based off a true story, I'm going to say it right now it's not based off a true story, however it is based of real life events of serial killer Ed Gein he also inspired Silence of the Lambs and Psycho (you can look up his crimes if you want but a word of warning they are incredibly disturbing). To start off this movie is set in a weird documentary like style of filming, I really like this because it makes it feel very real. The movie's performances from the Sawyer family, they're all incredibly crazy and the actors did a great job of showing off the insanity and of course we have Leatherface the most disturbing movie serial killer for the fact that he wares human skin as masks and that his family eats their victims. Gunnar Hansen does a great job portraying Leatherface and fun fact Gunnar came up with the idea that Leatherface should be retarded. For a low budget grindhouse movie (cheap horror movies from the 70s using gore as their main selling point) the cinematography is great, all the interesting shots are top notch. The movie is also just so disturbingly frighting, the whole entire Sawyer house is filled with the dead skulls, bones, and skins of dead humans (very similar to the Ed Gein crimes) all of it makes you just very disturbed what also helps for the disturbing atmosphere with the cast and other things. Last thing to touch up on the movie has one of the most thrilling climaxes I've seen in any movie EVER! The last 15 minutes just never let up stuff keeps getting thrown at you, its just great! Final thoughts are that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre deserves the title of most disturbing movie ever made, it has great cinematography, acting, and atmosphere all lead by the amazing direction of Tobe Hooper, I will give Texas Chainsaw Massacre a 9.7 out of 10.

This one, I'd say is done okay.First off, the plot is weak. I saw The Addams Family movies in the order of Addams Family Reunion (I'll save you the trouble, its crap) and then Addams Family Values (which I thought was pretty funny) and it seems that the ones with Raul Julia as Gomez and Anjelica Houston as Morticia have the same kind of plot, Uncle Fester is forced by his fake mother to steal the Addams family fortune. In this one the villain is a mother figure, in the sequel its a girlfriend. The problem is that in the show Gomez would throw money at just about anything, even a doctor who treated Uncle Fester after he came out of the Bermuda Triangle and found in a fishnet (thats the story the mother uses to be around the house, and Fester, to blend in).Okay, I've explained my problems with the plot which is actually (unlike the sequel) the one and only focus. What about it is salvageable? This film is dumb fun. Many of the jokes are in character and its all round an entertaining film. The costumes are incredibly well designed (almost matching the show's to a tee) and the sets are amazingly well done.The casting is actually some of the best I've seen for a remake. The best one is surprisingly Raul Julia. In this he does kind of overplay his part but that just makes him all the more charismatic and enjoyable as Gomez Addams. Others I like are Christina Ricci as Wednesday (although, take my word for it, her time to shine was the sequel), Christopher Lloyd as Fester, Jimmy Workman as Pugsley and in this film, I actually felt myself warm up more for Anjelica Houston as Morticia. I love Carolyn Jones in the part but Anjelica Houston does stand firmly enough as Morticia.In terms of what I thought could be improved, the plot for one thing. The normal people in the show DID go into that house for more reasons than they wanted money out of Gomez's pocket. I also would've loved to have seen more of them interacting with normal people. In this film I can only count one scene where they were with people who WEREN'T THE VILLAIN'S and thats Wednesday and Pugsley's play (some of the funniest stuff in the movie).Overall I'd say this film is okay. Its not absolutely fantastic but even on its own merits, this film is well put together. Do I recommend it? Yes however don't expect too much.

I think so. It was a good call by New Line, especially considering that the director of Heavenly Creatures and Dead Alive did not exactly have mega-credentials.When I first read the book many decades ago, I learnt Feanorian script and basic Sindarin. I have read it many times since. So my expectations were high when I sat down for the first film. I must say I was mesmerized from Kate Blanchett's narration to the end when Frodo and Sam march towards an exquisitely done matte painting of Mordor.The full opus takes quite a few liberties with the book, from omissions (Tom Bombadil) to transpositions (Warg attack on Rohirrim in episode 2 rather than on the Fellowship in episode 1) to inventions (Sam being sent back home by Frodo in act 3). It merges and deletes characters (Arwen and her brother, Eomer and Erkenbrand), or invents them (the orc Sharku, a play on Saruman's nickname in a part of the book cut out entirely). Many of them are preferable to the alternatives that were considered (for instance, Arwen in film 2 showing up in Aragorn's dream, rather than as a battle maiden at Helm's Deep). Only rarely does it have plot holes (like Frodo suddenly brandishing a sword at Sam in Osgiliath, when they are prisoners of Faramir who surely removed all their weapons). Perhaps the greatest liberty is the constant weakening of the moral fibre of characters for the sake of creating short-lived dramatic tension (like Treebeard only making up his mind to fight when he sees that Saruman has killed his trees; or Faramir originally taking the ring towards Minas Tirith to echo his weaker brother.There is one incomprehensible artistic and business decision Why did Jackson not just end the third film with the crowning of King Elessar, and let Saruman live (as in the book, and as was potentially implied in the theatrical release)? Then they could have made a fourth film to take the hobbits to the scouring of the Shire. Anticlimax, you say? I bet film 4 would still have made a tidy sum because LOTR mania was at a high level in the early 2000s. And it would have avoided that awkward never-ending-ending in Return of the King. After seeing the income stream from 1-3, New Line would have gone for #4 and given the hobbits their own little final battle. As a positive side effect, it would have toned the scale down a little at the end, thus allowing The Hobbit, which is vastly overblown, to stay a little closer to the smaller scale of Tolkien's earlier book.All of this is easy to forgive because the films hews close to the spirit of the book overall, and departures are usually corrected, as in Sam's By all rights we shouldn't even be here (Osgiliath) - and soon they weren't. It is visually a masterpiece. Many have remarked that Jackson has finally trumped Kurosawa as the best big battle auteur, and I grudgingly admit it's true (although I still like RAN better than LOTR; it's one of a few films I give a 10). He forces bold acting out of the actors sometimes, with pathos and tears pushed to the verge of what is acceptable. The level of detail in the scenery, weaponry, sets, costumes, just everything, is absolutely amazing; and yet the filmmakers resisted the temptation to gloat over it. So much work for a few seconds of screen time! The film is complex and textured, a classic like Gone with the Wind and the better costume dramas of the 50s when it comes to big bold scale.In the end, the film became my visual impression of the books for the most part, and that's a great compliment because I had read the books multiple times and certainly formed mental pictures of what everything is like.

","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"17 January 2014","score":"","review":" James Cameron's The Terminator is an excellent of a start to an epic sci-fi saga. The Terminator is Cameron's first major film, and he couldn't of done any better. The Terminator is an all-around better sci-fi action film equipped with great direction, brilliant storytelling, and high caliber acting from Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, and, of course, Arnold. Arnold. Arnold. That's right, use your Austrian accent. Arnold. I love, Arnold. Arnold, Schwarzenegger was the strongest selection on planet Earth to become the Terminator. Arnold is the Terminator. The Terminator launches Schwarzenegger's career into unprecedented superstardom. The Terminator is Schwarzenegger's most iconic role. I'll be back. Linda Hamilton, too, is literally the best woman in the world to be Sarah Conner. She was born to play Sarah, and she has earned it. Michael Biehn has the star strength of a soldier. Biehn's tough to replace as Kyle Reese, the man sent back in time 50 years from the future on a succeed at all costs mission to protect Sarah Connor, the mother of her unborn child, John Connor, who is the leader of the human resistance against the machines far into the future, and yep, you guessed it, the machines sent back Arnold the Terminator to Sarah Connor's time to hunt her and kill her. The Terminator has a timeless battle of resourceful human soldier, Kyle Reese, vs. unstoppable killing machine, the Terminator. The Terminator has an innovative and groundbreaking story for its time. The Terminator is high conceptual cinema that's powerfully dramatic and happens to be a bit scary at times. Bill Paxton plays his role for the time making for more classic Cameron. One thing that really makes the Terminator special, that you wouldn't have known at the time, is that its sequel, Terminator 2 Judgment Day, is one of the all-time 50 best movies, and easily in the conversation of being the best sci-fi fantasy adventure, along with a few other Cameron greats, like Avatar, Aliens and The Abyss. T2 improves in all the right areas where T1 is minorly lacking. The Terminator very much feels like one extended and incomplete preview, yet, outstanding outing of the soon to be conceived and released, T2. I love The Terminator story, and I'm a big fan of all of the Terminator movies, especially T2. Arnold. I'll be back.

This is foreshadowed in the beginning of the film when Yun-fat's character describes how his meditation leads him to a place of sorrow instead of enlightenment. In a later scene, Yeoh 's character questions the buddhist teaching of Fat's character in relation to their suppressed love, pointing out the touch of her hand is real,not an illusion, even though it is of this world. However it is also the discipline of this eastern spirituality that gives these knights their power. the main character Jen, abuses this power, along with the power given to her when she possesses the Green Destiny, a magical and powerful sword, owned by the wizard -like, or jedi- like, character portrayed by Chow Yun-Fat.

(That sounds bad. Sorry Gwyneth.)And this is a great movie for its writing, and a stiff and imperfect movie for its acting. And for Austen fans (and fans is an understatement for some of them) this is almost awful movie. Awful if you love sublime writing and can't stand to see it so wooden. Paltrow is good. She's pretty. She's appropriately upright. But she insists on delivering her lines. She has them memorized, yes. But she doesn't inhabit the character. And Emma, the character, is one of the best of all literature, filled with sassy individualism and social blindness due to ordinary teenage arrogance. The material is there, and it's a great story (if you like early 19th Century melodramas bordering on soap opera of the highest level). So, it's not a terrible presentation of the movie, but it is, to be sure, a presentation. I honestly think (and don't tremble in rage here) that Alisha Silverstone in Clueless gets the spirit of Emma much closer. There is of course a gap of sensibilities here that I'm ignoring&#x97;a girl in 1995 (Silverstone) is no match for a girl in Austen's time. I'll leave that one vague.About Emma it's worth saying that the sets and costumes are so convincing you don't really think about them. Everything is brightly lit (which I suppose is a reasonable choice, though it flattens the film emotionally as opposed to, say, the Merchant-Ivory approach). The whole spectacle is spread before the camera lovingly, if a bit predictably. In the end it's Austen who wins. The writing, both in the specific dialog and in the general plot outline, are delicate and witty and insightful. Nothing sensational here, just drawing room observation at its best.

Bradin, ironically, plays a bit of a stick who has more in common with Betty's father than she does, but her devotion to both men makes us care for all three. It also a striking issue, namely how much people can love one another when they not only fail to understand each other but don't see the need.Seeing them come to terms with this is what makes the film work as a comedy, yet it's not enough unless you take their problem seriously, which as a comedy this isn't geared to do. Balfour's engaging if light performance does all it can to square the circle, and it's enough, just. Champagne may not be that substantive otherwise, but it's worth a sip.

At so brisk a pace, almost every moment is occupied with either derring-do or rapid-fire dialogue.

Yet still it's full of tension and suspense.The film starts out with a sudden and unnecessary murder. On the surface, killer Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) doesn't betray a bit of conscience. But his trigger finger has prevented him from consummating an encounter with a lovely saloon maid (Felicia Farr). Wade comes to realize that his choices in life are adding up to a big, fat zero. The way he's heading, he'll never have a wife and kids like Dan Evans (Van Hefflin), the poor shlub who's risking his life to haul him in to the law. Neither man sees it coming, but each influences the other powerfully.Evans has turned bounty hunter because he needs the money. Wade seems to deeply appreciate women, and man, does he miss taking a woman to bed! The chemistry between Emmy and Wade is palpable and intense.What's a woman for if you don't treat her right? Ford purrs to his would-be lady love.At points along the way, Wade is taunting, shaming, and threatening to the seemingly not-so-swift Evans, who politely answers all his questions until Wade mutters, I'll bet (your wife) was a real beautiful woman before she met you. At a certain point, it's as if Evans keeps on keeping on not for the money anymore but for his own need to grow up and just stop taking crap. It's his own growing a backbone that captures Wade's attention and spurs his own self-sacrificing turnaround -- even though it leads straight to the gallows. Like a better-known western, Shane, that has a lot more going on than initially meets the eye, 310 to Yuma captures the struggle between bullies of the world and plain old folks who just want to live their lives -- folks who'd rather not fight, but will do battle if there's no other way.I heartily recommend this film to anyone with an interest in psychological development and spiritual redemption.Don't overlook the brief funeral scene, with its solitary dog atop a plain wooden coffin. There's poetry here, amid the dust, craggy rocks, cacti, and big open sky.Based on a story by Elmore Leonard, this film far transcends its ordinary surroundings.

For starters Psycho is chock full of nerve tingling suspense that's probably one of the movie's greatest strengths. The suspense is handled so well by Alfred Hitchcock , after all the guy's nickname is the master of suspense. Other great strengths that this movie offers is it's amazing performance by it's lead actor Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, he plays a great character who has been broken by his mother to insanity. The rest of the cast does a fine job too especially Janet Leight. The movie is also full of so many twist and turns most of these are common knowledge now but back in 1960 no one knew what hit them. The music, we cant forget Bernard Herman's excellent music score that fits the tone of the movie perfectly, the music was most famously used in the shower scene now one of cinema's most recognizable moments.The twist ending is great it will catch you completely off guard. Psycho; a movie full of twists and turns, suspense at every corner, perfect music, great acting and all lead by probably the greatest film director of all times, Psycho does receive from me a 9.5 out of 10.

What the bodyguard chooses to do first with his newfound independence is quite surprising and ambitious, like piecing together an amazingly complex jigsaw puzzle made of human nature, or staging a performance of an epic masterpiece with no previous management, production, or directing skills. But I guess he may as well tackle a mountain, since there is not much use starting small with his skills and personality. As he orchestrates the deception, our hero is much like a master puppeteer with exquisite timing and talent to incite the mayhem to achieve his goal. While the basic theme of this story is not unique - the result of greed, manipulation of others, and the changing of the world (tradition vs. progression) - many factors add an interesting and unusual charm to this film. There are plots within plots, surprising deception, perfectly paced mounting tension, unpredictable plot twists, stories within stories, distinctive and amusing characters (the big guy with his huge mallet is a lot of fun), the seemingly never-ending face offs, backstabbing, character flaws; and our hero continually placed in the perfect position to observe, listen, and evaluate. Also, the bodyguard's impeccable timing in manipulation of both sides is nice, fulfilling our expectations and keeping the story moving along. What if bodyguards were really like this? (mischievous, brilliant, manipulative) The famous people of the world would be in terrible trouble.The humor in this story is wonderful, even the macabre humor of the dog carrying the human hand in its mouth while trotting along to fairly spunky music. I also love the funnier fight sequences, which seem to come right out of clown school and resemble football skirmishes instead of battles. In several of the scenes, it appears that the swordsmen are miming roasting marshmallows instead of fighting with their weapons. Nice addition of lightness to a serious tale. Our hero sticking around after he has discontinued his services purely for the entertainment also accentuates the humor aspect of this movie.The mix of character types is also interesting including a dominatrix, a prodigal son, a damsel in distress, several amusing drunks, and many bumbling idiots. The ease in which our hero is able to manipulate these human beings is extremely unbelievable; however, many aspects of this film fall into that category and it is still a wonderful story.
