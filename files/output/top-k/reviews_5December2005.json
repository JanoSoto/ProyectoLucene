And his two more recent films--Sideways and About Schmidt--have been much gentler (thought still terrific) than his earlier efforts. Before Election, Payne had already made Citizen Ruth, a caustic, bracing satire of the abortion issue, and Election continued his penchant for harsh, uncomfortable comedy. I mean that in a good way, though. Payne's movies are funny, but they make you uneasy for laughing at them, and they have sharp, intelligent insights into the attitudes that drive American values.In Election, Payne uses a high school class presidential election as an opportunity to lampoon everything that's goofy about the American political system. Just as in our national elections for president, the winner is not necessarily the person with the most integrity, and honesty is a liability, not a virtue. The person who is willing to play dirtiest comes out on top, and elections aren't about who is most qualified but rather about who is most popular. And, the best part about the movie is its acknowledgement of voter apathy. Most Americans don't really give a damn, something that makes them not so different from the majority of high schoolers who don't even understand the point of having a class president to begin with. In fact, in the film's best scene, the assembly at which each candidate gives her\/his campaign speech, one of the candidates (who joins the race out of spite) gets the best reception from the crowd when she encourages everyone not to vote at all.Reese Witherspoon gives a wonderful performance as Tracy Flick, the school's most likely to succeed, whose goodie-goodie exterior hides the fact that she's willing to do just about anything to get ahead. Matthew Broderick is refreshingly unlikable as a social studies teacher who would like to see Tracy fail just once, until the fact that his own life is falling apart turns this wish into an obsession. And Chris Klein has some fun as the dopey, Jesus-following popular guy who becomes Tracy's arch rival, but never really even knows it.Payne doesn't tidy up his film's moral messages. On the one hand, Tracy is obnoxious, and we want to see her fail as much as Broderick's character does. But she does know how to play the game, and isn't that part of what makes someone a good leader? We sympathize with Broderick up to a point, but his motives really are driven by a personal vendetta, not by any altruistic ideal of right vs. wrong. So if you normally need someone to root for in order to enjoy a movie, you're probably not going to like this one. But who expects a hero?...I mean, come on, we're talking about American politics here.

Why would a hardened criminal care to pay for the laundry cleaning of a bloke who just had a glass of water splashed in his face? And to also add a sentimental gesture in his face to top it off doesn't seem fitting for a stone cold psycho killer. What was Jack's purpose for his rampage? He even murdered two people who weren't even affiliated with his brother's murder. Was it only vengeance he was seeking? Was his personal vendetta aimed toward just anyone who knew of his brother's death? Is this a revenge tale gone out of control just to show violence for violence sake? If Jack was so mad about his niece involved in a pornographic film, why is he himself a rapist, brute and degenerate scum? Is he a hypocrite? Obviously. This double-standard is not handled well here. This story doesn't really concern itself with an overall balance of morals. It presents crime and violence and basically shows how violence begets violence. I ask myself if anyone could have played the role as effectively as Michael Caine? I'm sure. Caine offered an uncanny and sinister quality to his character that straddled nonchalance with utter creepiness. But he doesn't look tough to me. I also have questions concerning the Kinnear gang.

The majority of the movie entails murder, bludgeoning and rough em' up debriefings which often don't get Jack anywhere. Why any woman want to have sex with a man like Jack Carter makes me think of the sexual prowess phenomenon of Ted Bundy. It seems just unbelievable. This movie is pure sleaze. It's scum versus scum. And it is very effective at keeping your attention. Why?! Because it plays on the hate formula. Jack Carter does such despicable things that you can't wait to see him get killed. He gets shot in the head at the very end with a rifle. I was hoping he would get mutilated in pain. The film is effective in showing industrial Britain in all of its grisly and wretched details. Michael Caine looks too pasty and flabby and not in good physical shape to play a tough guy. The only offset to this drawback is that all the enemies are flabby or wimpy themselves.

I also didn't understand the scene where Jack asks Eric Paice to take off his sunglasses so he can see his face. This struck me as very weird.

Dowd was played by Frank Fay on Broadway and in London - and to universal acclaim. Fay (who had alcohol problems of his own) could bring that aspect to the role (Stewart brushes it when he goes to Mr. Cracker's bar), but Fay also showed (from some of the descriptions I have read) a muscularity of mind that Stewart does not quite show. Fay's Elwood has wondered about the phenomenon of his invisible\/invincible friend, and while he accepts it he truly is in awe of the phenomenon. But Stewart has grown to just enjoy his friend's remarkable powers. He accepts them, and never tries to fathom them.As the play continues we see how the harmless Elwood and Harvey distress so many people. His sister Veta and niece Myrtle Mae blame them for isolating them from their social register friends. Judge Gaffney sympathizes with Veta, and her determination to put Elwood into an asylum. Dr. Sanderson and Nurse Kelly see Elwood as a potential patient, as does the dismissive Dr. Chumley. And Wilson has the most experienced (and realistic) view of insanity of anyone - he doesn't trust the inmates (more of that later).The thing that is amazing in HARVEY is that everyone ends up accepting the Pooka - and in the case of Dr. Chumley actively seeking to take Elwood's place. It's because of their disillusionment with the society that they try to placate. Myrtle Mae and Wilson both think Elwood is a nut, but they find they like each other. They both are on different levels of the social scale, but both are lonely, and they click (much to the dismay of Veta, who was briefly manhandled by Wilson as an asylum guard). Gaffney is supportive of Veta's actions towards Elwood (although he always liked Elwood) because he is in love with Veta. But he gets fed up because of Veta's own unwillingness to remain consistent about what to do with Elwood. Sanderson and Kelly get their wires crossed, and Sanderson actually thinks Veta is the mentally ill person (and it is sometimes feasible to believe it). It leads to Chumley briefly firing his assistant, and in the temporary disaster Kelly and Sanderson revealing their deeper feelings about each other. Soon they are just as willing to listen to Elwood's philosophy of life as they are in locating him for giving him the medication that may cure him - but turn him (in the words of the taxi driver) into just another stinker like the rest of us.Chumley is more interesting. He later admits that Harvey is so remarkable that everything that science has discovered is child's play compared to him. He does end up wanting to replace Elwood in Harvey's affections, but it is only for a temporary loan so that he can have an emotional release in some motel in Akron, Ohio with a simple, sympathetic woman and some beer. It's as though the society that has honored him actually chokes Chumley - his dream is a general rejection of respectability for two weeks only, as it is impossible to imagine he can get away with much more. As he is married it is very probable that the two weeks would be about all his need for release and freedom can guarantee him.The people who do accept Elwood and Harvey are not people with responsibility or position. Mr. Cracker and his customers (except one wise guy at the start of the film) see nothing odd at Elwood having an invisible friend. The taxi driver likes people like Elwood - they appreciate the trip to the asylum, and his driving. Mr. Schimmelplusser (Clem Bevans) is usually ignored by the Chumley's of the world who employ him, but he is very proud of the electronic fence and likes Elwood's notice of it. Elwood and Harvey have the support of the little people. As Elwood explains it, he could have been successful or pleasant, and he chose to be pleasant. Most people do want to be pleasant.HARVEY is one of the world's best fantasy plays, and it's success far transcended what was expected in the late 1940s when Mary Chase wrote it. Tragically, the reality of mental illness does not always allow for Elwood's pleasant disposition. Wilson actually has the most realistic moment in the play when he explains to Sanderson and Kelly that he has seen the insane close up - that frequently they are all sweetness until they know that they are not being observed, and then they do really life threatening damage to you. He actually happens to be correct.Although his reactions throughout the play are meant as comic blunderings or such (witness the marvelous moment when he reads the dictionary definition of Pooka), he does show one moment that (to me) makes his roughness understandable and even heroic when Dr. Chumley has disappeared after going off with Elwood, Wilson suddenly shows deep concern for the poor doctor, imagining him lying insensible in a pool of blood. It doesn't happen, but in reality it could happen very easily in the real world. The entire cast, especially Stewart and Josephine Hutchinson (Best Supporting Oscar) were wonderful, but at that moment Jesse White was superb.

Manhattan DOES have a perfect opening. No sooner has the film started than you're hit by the sublime synthesis of George Gershwin's music, Gordon Willis' black and white widescreen photography and Woody Allen's voice-over. It's a combination that spoils the senses and one that plainly states Allen's intentions. This is a movie with a capital M.It's also a poem to New York. The opening monologue expresses all of Allen's contradictory feelings towards the town through a series of possible openings for a novel his character is writing. It's beautifully written and very funny. But it's also very romantic, as even when he's criticising the place it's clear he loves it. And with Allen's words you have Willis' images. The city has never looked better.Then the voice-over stops and you have fireworks set to Gershwin's music. It's a New York that doesn't exist in real life, only on film and in Allen's mind. Yet it's ridiculously appealing. Just for a little while you fall in love with this version of New York too.Such a great opening raises expectations, but Manhattan more than lives up to it. My favourite bit is another one of the romantic moments in film. It's the shot that is used on the posters of Woody Allen and Diane Keaton sitting on a bench in front of the 59th Street Bridge. It's probably one of the best shots in cinema &#150; it's ridiculously simple but it also ridiculously beautiful.But my favourite scene in the film is the party scene. Isaac (Allen) goes to a party full of pretentious snobs who are talking about orgasms. One of the men there is a filmmaker. He explains his concept. I'm just about to direct a film of my own script. The premise is this guy screws so great that when he brings a woman to orgasm, she's so fulfilled that she dies. Then a woman brings up that she finally had an orgasm but her doctor told her it was the wrong kind. To which Isaac says that he's never had the wrong kind that even his worst was right on the money. Oh, and before this, they talk about a Nazi parade that is being planned in Manhattan. Another one of the women chimes in with her vapid viewpoint. But biting satire is always better than physical force. And again, Isaac is the voice of sanity. No, physical force is better with Nazis. I really do hope that rich parties are like this. I'd be terribly disappointed if they weren't rife with pretension and champagne posturing.But although the party scene is essentially a throwaway, sexual politics is definitely a theme (as it is in most of Allen's films). Isaac, who's 42, is going out with a 17-year old and his second ex-wife divorced him to live with her female lover. And to make it worse, his ex has written a book about their marriage. This leads to another funny scene where his friends read aloud extracts detailing his many failings. But from this marriage he has a young son. And Isaac is worried about two women bringing him up. I always feel very few people survive one mother. But to complicate things even further, Isaac starts seeing Mary (Keaton) who's the lover of Isaac's friend Yale who's married. Fidelity is a quaint concept in Allen's world.However, with everyone indulging their whims, you'd expect them to be happy. Only they're not. It seems like when you can have everything you only end up making yourself miserable. What people need is stability. They need grounding. But in a place as vast as Manhattan, you never stay still, a point illustrated by Isaac having to move halfway through. He may love New York but he has no roots. And he's frightened of putting them down. After all, he has a great thing with the 17-year old Tracy. She's smart, she's fun and she's half his age, yet he seems intent on sabotaging their relationship. He cheats on her with the more neurotic Mary. And it's quite clear that Mary and Isaac aren't really right for one another. They may be pretty much the same age, but they don't have the same taste in movies, books and art; there's a funny scene where Isaac first meets Mary and they all talk about their tastes. Isaac gets visibly annoyed when Mary criticises Ingmar Bergman. I share Isaac's pain. There's nothing more annoying that someone ragging on your favourite director (or writer or musician or band or&#133;).But amidst the quiet despair there are moments of ease and happiness. You have the moment on the bridge, the bit where Isaac and Tracy ride through Central Park and the bit when Isaac and Tracy are watching TV in bed. But they're all fleeting and they all seem to be private moments. In public Isaac seems to be embarrassed by Tracy. He's dating a girl who does homework and he's older than her father. He doesn't seem to be able to handle the scrutiny that their relationship attracts. And when he goes out publicly with Mary it results in more awkwardness &#150; he goes to the theatre with Mary who's next to her ex-lover Yale who's next to his wife. And besides, his relationship with Mary seems to be more of a product of loneliness. Therefore the ending is bittersweet. He finally admits his feelings for Tracy but it's too late. He's screwed up his opportunity. But that doesn't mean the ending is sombre. If anything, it's upbeat. You may feel there's no hope for this immature man (he baulks at having to wait a mere six months for her as she studies in London) but you feel there's a lot for this mature girl.

Marked at first by stark, beautiful photography of the American Southwest, later by memorable dialogue and conversational intercourse, and lastly by sublime and emotionally involving character development, the film transcends the idea of an atmospheric mood piece to deliver an engrossing meditation on loneliness, alienation, family, and redemption.Character actor Harry Dean Stanton is fantastic in the lead role of Travis -- a man who had fallen into an emotional black hole and is then reunited with his brother (Dean Stockwell), who has been raising Travis' young son, Hunter (Hunter Carson), in an idyllic and loving suburban landscape with his foreign wife, Ann (Aurore Clement). As Travis slowly begins to grapple with his past and bond with his son, he soon realizes he must find his long, lost wife, Jane (an excellent and understated Nastassja Kinksi), whom he still deeply loves on some level, and abandoned their son years ago shortly after Travis went off the deep end.This all could've been the plot of Lifetime TV movie, but the European filmmaker's perspective on an all American slice of melodrama adds an undercurrent of intrigue in that you never know what these characters are going to do next. We soon find Travis practically abducting his son (who eagerly plays along) from his happy new family life to go on a trek to Houston to find Jane.The closing in scene in a Houston hotel where son and mother are reunited is one of the most fascinatingly rich scenes ever put on screen. Rarely does any one scene work to engage a viewer on so many levels Firstly There is a complex psychological framework that is set into place in the scenes prior between Stanton and Kinski in the peep show booth where she now works which are two of the most expertly photographed and brilliantly acted scenes I've ever witnessed. Travis has confessed all to his lost love, Jane, and she is clearly in dire straits. His attempt to reunite her with their son is both selfish (in that it is clearly not in the child's best interest to be raised by his emotionally troubled mother when he has loving foster parents waiting for him back home) and selfless, in that he truly feels his only way to repair the damage he has done is to leave after getting mother and son back together.Secondly It is beautifully acted with Kinski's ghost-like entrance and young Hunter Carson's trepidation. Witness his hand slide across the wall looking for something to grip, and then his hands running through his hair before he finally decides to embrace her.Thirdly It is exquisitely photographed. Earlier we see scenes of stark isolation as the child waits in the hotel room. Sofia Coppola later used a similar photographic technique in Lost in Translation to show how being alone in a big city and looking down from an anonymous hotel room window can be one of the loneliest things in the world.The final scene is both beautiful and emotional, and at the same time makes the viewer wonder, how will this all end? Yes, it is wonderful to see the child and mother reunite, but their new life could easily turn into an emotional hell because of the now absent Travis' misguided attempt at his own redemption.A film working on so many levels like this is best summed up in its own dialogue. In one scene where Travis is drunk and telling his son some family history, he essentially says that his father was more in love with an idea of her than with his actual mother. This is a fantastic movie for people more in love with the romantic idea of movies and their potential power as an art form than with any one movie in particular. As such, this ranks among the best I have ever seen.

Yes, it is wonderful to see the child and mother reunite, but their new life could easily turn into an emotional hell because of the now absent Travis' misguided attempt at his own redemption.A film working on so many levels like this is best summed up in its own dialogue. In one scene where Travis is drunk and telling his son some family history, he essentially says that his father was more in love with an idea of her than with his actual mother.

As such, this ranks among the best I have ever seen. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"5 December 2005","score":"21 out of 25 people found the following review useful","review":" Directed by cinematic lyricist Wim Wenders, Paris, Texas is a slow-burning masterpiece. Marked at first by stark, beautiful photography of the American Southwest, later by memorable dialogue and conversational intercourse, and lastly by sublime and emotionally involving character development, the film transcends the idea of an atmospheric mood piece to deliver an engrossing meditation on loneliness, alienation, family, and redemption.Character actor Harry Dean Stanton is fantastic in the lead role of Travis -- a man who had fallen into an emotional black hole and is then reunited with his brother (Dean Stockwell), who has been raising Travis' young son, Hunter (Hunter Carson), in an idyllic and loving suburban landscape with his foreign wife, Ann (Aurore Clement). As Travis slowly begins to grapple with his past and bond with his son, he soon realizes he must find his long, lost wife, Jane (an excellent and understated Nastassja Kinksi), whom he still deeply loves on some level, and abandoned their son years ago shortly after Travis went off the deep end.This all could've been the plot of Lifetime TV movie, but the European filmmaker's perspective on an all American slice of melodrama adds an undercurrent of intrigue in that you never know what these characters are going to do next. We soon find Travis practically abducting his son (who eagerly plays along) from his happy new family life to go on a trek to Houston to find Jane.The closing in scene in a Houston hotel where son and mother are reunited is one of the most fascinatingly rich scenes ever put on screen. Rarely does any one scene work to engage a viewer on so many levels Firstly There is a complex psychological framework that is set into place in the scenes prior between Stanton and Kinski in the peep show booth where she now works which are two of the most expertly photographed and brilliantly acted scenes I've ever witnessed. Travis has confessed all to his lost love, Jane, and she is clearly in dire straits. His attempt to reunite her with their son is both selfish (in that it is clearly not in the child's best interest to be raised by his emotionally troubled mother when he has loving foster parents waiting for him back home) and selfless, in that he truly feels his only way to repair the damage he has done is to leave after getting mother and son back together.Secondly It is beautifully acted with Kinski's ghost-like entrance and young Hunter Carson's trepidation. Witness his hand slide across the wall looking for something to grip, and then his hands running through his hair before he finally decides to embrace her.Thirdly It is exquisitely photographed. Earlier we see scenes of stark isolation as the child waits in the hotel room.

If anything it's more of a dark comedy. Pregnancy is the joke and giving birth to the child of Satan is the punch line.But that's not to say that the film doesn't have its moments. The dreams are certainly creepy. Indeed, the way that Polanski films Satan having sex with Farrow with a bunch old Satanists watching would probably put the willies up most expectant mothers (so to speak). But then again, maybe that's my problem as regards finding the film scary. I'm never going to be giving birth, so I'll never know what it's like to be in that position.However, the film does do an excellent job of portraying the helplessness of pregnancy and the paranoia that can come about with no longer having control of your own body. Rosemary starts the film as an able woman, a woman who can choose an apartment and make decisions, but once she's pregnant she's ruled by doctors, nosey neighbours and her husband. Suddenly she's passive and suddenly her own importance is downgraded. It's as if she's a mere incubator.I'm sure that's something a lot of women must feel when they're pregnant. They must feel like conduits. But Rosemary's Baby takes that idea and takes it to extremes.One of the most amusing things about Rosemary's Baby is its Satanists. Here you have a coven populated mainly by wrinklies and old codgers. Never before have old people been so evil. But then again, are they really that evil? I mean, Rosemary's neighbours provide her with chocolate moose and herb drinks. What's wrong with that? Well, I guess there's a bit of a moral failing when the moose knocks Rosemary out so that Beelzebub can rape her. And I suppose Satan could have at least been a gentleman and date-raped her the old-fashioned way - with a drink and some Rohypnol. But they're mere formalities. And besides, the result would have been the same. But I do like the way that Rosemary doesn't eat all the knockout moose and is partially aware of having sex with the Devil. It adds to the weird helplessness of the scene. The whole thing is like a night terror. Indeed, despite thinking it's real while experiencing it, she puts it down to a dream. After all, it's too crazy to be true, isn't it? Watching the film again it's fun seeing how the conspiracy works. I mean, when you first watch it, you're not sure whether Rosemary is just going insane. You don't know whether it's mere paranoia. But while the weird chanting through the walls stuck out during the first viewing, when I watched it again I noticed how Rosemary's husband goes off to meet alone with their Satanist neighbours. He's obviously being seduced. Then there's the offhand way that Minnie (one of the neighbours) asks whether Rosemary wants children. It's done in such a light way &#150; Minnie herself doesn't even seem interested in the answer &#150; that when you first view it, you kind of miss this obsessive interest. But you've also got the herb drink, the doctor, the moose, the way that her husband runs off to tell the neighbours about the pregnancy and the way that one of her friends, an old man who is the only voice of dissent when it comes how the pregnancy is handled, goes into a coma and dies. Rosemary is right to be paranoid. Things are going on behind her back.And that's part of the film's genius, especially in the way it's directed. Rosemary is the focus of everything. She's in every scene and everything is from her viewpoint. Therefore you can never be sure, when you first watch it, whether it's just a fantasy. And Mia Farrow is a big factor in the film's success. Among some actresses there could be a tendency to overplay things, but she plays it as a woman desperately trying to keep control. Only when things go absolutely insane does she resort to hysterics. Consequently, you like her and you want everything to work out for her. And it's also quite winning the way that she gets her haircut during her pregnancy to try and reaffirm her identity and importance, and the way that she talks to her baby when she starts to seriously loose it. She's a woman pushed to the limit, but she's a woman who fights it admirably.And that likability works for the ending. When she finally sees her baby and what it is, you wonder what she's going to do and you actually care. And the fact that she doesn't kill it and that she begins to embrace it (by rocking the crib with an almost misty look on her face) makes it rather sad. But when you think about it, it's not too absurd that she'd become a mother to Satan's child. I mean, just look at some kids today. Would this kid really be much worse? And I'm sure that being Satan's concubine must have certain perks. But seriously, how often do you hear, he's got a face only a mother can love? And people always speak of 'little devils'. The maternal instinct is strong.But although the ending is creepy and sad, at the same time I find it funny. Just take the way that all the old fogies start shouting, Hail Satan! Or the way that the oriental guy snaps photos. Then there's the woman rocking the crib and fact that the scheming neighbour says that the baby has his father's eyes. There's a lot of dark humour in the film and the ending is where it comes through strongest. But that doesn't mean that the joke is funny for poor Rosemary.

But you've also got the herb drink, the doctor, the moose, the way that her husband runs off to tell the neighbours about the pregnancy and the way that one of her friends, an old man who is the only voice of dissent when it comes how the pregnancy is handled, goes into a coma and dies. Rosemary is right to be paranoid. Things are going on behind her back.And that's part of the film's genius, especially in the way it's directed. Rosemary is the focus of everything. She's in every scene and everything is from her viewpoint. Therefore you can never be sure, when you first watch it, whether it's just a fantasy. And Mia Farrow is a big factor in the film's success. Among some actresses there could be a tendency to overplay things, but she plays it as a woman desperately trying to keep control. Only when things go absolutely insane does she resort to hysterics. Consequently, you like her and you want everything to work out for her. And it's also quite winning the way that she gets her haircut during her pregnancy to try and reaffirm her identity and importance, and the way that she talks to her baby when she starts to seriously loose it. She's a woman pushed to the limit, but she's a woman who fights it admirably.And that likability works for the ending. When she finally sees her baby and what it is, you wonder what she's going to do and you actually care. And the fact that she doesn't kill it and that she begins to embrace it (by rocking the crib with an almost misty look on her face) makes it rather sad. But when you think about it, it's not too absurd that she'd become a mother to Satan's child. I mean, just look at some kids today. Would this kid really be much worse? And I'm sure that being Satan's concubine must have certain perks. But seriously, how often do you hear, he's got a face only a mother can love? And people always speak of 'little devils'. The maternal instinct is strong.But although the ending is creepy and sad, at the same time I find it funny. Just take the way that all the old fogies start shouting, Hail Satan! Or the way that the oriental guy snaps photos. Then there's the woman rocking the crib and fact that the scheming neighbour says that the baby has his father's eyes.

","genre":"Drama, Horror"},{"date":"5 December 2005","score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Even though I think Rosemary's Baby is a fantastic film, I wouldn't really class it as particularly scary. If anything it's more of a dark comedy. Pregnancy is the joke and giving birth to the child of Satan is the punch line.But that's not to say that the film doesn't have its moments. The dreams are certainly creepy. Indeed, the way that Polanski films Satan having sex with Farrow with a bunch old Satanists watching would probably put the willies up most expectant mothers (so to speak). But then again, maybe that's my problem as regards finding the film scary. I'm never going to be giving birth, so I'll never know what it's like to be in that position.However, the film does do an excellent job of portraying the helplessness of pregnancy and the paranoia that can come about with no longer having control of your own body. Rosemary starts the film as an able woman, a woman who can choose an apartment and make decisions, but once she's pregnant she's ruled by doctors, nosey neighbours and her husband. Suddenly she's passive and suddenly her own importance is downgraded. It's as if she's a mere incubator.I'm sure that's something a lot of women must feel when they're pregnant. They must feel like conduits. But Rosemary's Baby takes that idea and takes it to extremes.One of the most amusing things about Rosemary's Baby is its Satanists. Here you have a coven populated mainly by wrinklies and old codgers. Never before have old people been so evil. But then again, are they really that evil? I mean, Rosemary's neighbours provide her with chocolate moose and herb drinks. What's wrong with that? Well, I guess there's a bit of a moral failing when the moose knocks Rosemary out so that Beelzebub can rape her. And I suppose Satan could have at least been a gentleman and date-raped her the old-fashioned way - with a drink and some Rohypnol. But they're mere formalities. And besides, the result would have been the same. But I do like the way that Rosemary doesn't eat all the knockout moose and is partially aware of having sex with the Devil. It adds to the weird helplessness of the scene. The whole thing is like a night terror. Indeed, despite thinking it's real while experiencing it, she puts it down to a dream. After all, it's too crazy to be true, isn't it? Watching the film again it's fun seeing how the conspiracy works. I mean, when you first watch it, you're not sure whether Rosemary is just going insane. You don't know whether it's mere paranoia. But while the weird chanting through the walls stuck out during the first viewing, when I watched it again I noticed how Rosemary's husband goes off to meet alone with their Satanist neighbours. He's obviously being seduced. Then there's the offhand way that Minnie (one of the neighbours) asks whether Rosemary wants children. It's done in such a light way &#150; Minnie herself doesn't even seem interested in the answer &#150; that when you first view it, you kind of miss this obsessive interest.

His friend, Hank Morgan (Michael Rapaport) is all for the future and what it holds; he even has a virtual girlfriend.But after Adam comes home one night to find someone in his house (There's someone in my house, eating my birthday cake, with my family!), he grows worried and soon finds a cloning conspiracy headed by a man named Drucker (Tony Goldwyn) and a scientist played by Robert Duvall who isn't quite so sure he's doing the right thing.The 6th Day pretty much flopped when it came out.

You could actually raise yourself. Of course, the question is whether you would want to raise yourself, but that's merely a technicality. And could you imagine if time machines and cloning devices existed in the same future? The results and\/or possibilities are endless.One other thing I liked about this film is that they do not disclose the year.

The images of the future burst through the screen like the hovercopters we see and they make a direct route right into your brain. This is a spectacular movie with a clear vision of the future--don't miss it.

Pleasantville explores a greatly simplified fantasy world -- a hypothetical 50's TV sitcom -- and examines what happens when reality intrudes on its premises. As Shakespeare put it, There's more to heaven and earth than is dreamt of in your philosophy.Unfortunately, some reviewers see the film as commentary of another kind. They view it as a confirmation of, or attack on, their own personal philosophies, political, social, or the like. For those who are expecting such, let me say what Pleasantville is NOT* It is not a criticism of the 1950s, its social mores or political bent.* It is not a celebration of liberalism versus some conservative straightjacket view of the world.* It is not a groundbreaking, original thought piece on philosophy, religion or anything of the like.The creators of this film could have made it such, but I think they were smarter than that.What Pleasantville IS is a celebration of real life, in all its messy, confusing, beautiful and often painful detail. And the celebration is masterfully executed.The device of the 50s sitcom is used to convey the film's central point that it is often easy, comforting, even helpful for us to think about things in simplistic terms, and even that there isn't anything wrong with that per se.But to think about REAL LIFE this way is to live a smaller, lesser life. Life without color is easy to look at, and it certainly works. But a black-and-white life is certainly less of a life. OK, that one's easy, and that's where Pleasantville starts. (I'm supposed to be IN COLOR!) Even the next evolution, that life is better with sex, is pretty much taken for granted, but of course that enhancement to Pleasantville later brings the real-life complications we can all predict.And the complications continue, as Pleasantville residents discover that there are other places in the world, other people, other ways to think and imagine as evidenced in the books that had all heretofore been blank. As evidenced in the changes in music we hear at the soda shop. And these complications aren't all good. They introduce upheaval, prejudice, violence.But the film successfully carries the theme that you just can't have the good without the bad. It keeps reminding the viewer that, if you're thinking that way, you are missing a subtlety of life, and you'd better think again. And I think it goes even further, making the case that even the existence of these evils makes life the richer for living, because they enable us to distinguish what we like and wish for from what we find reprehensible.My favorite scene of the film may be when Bud brings Mr. Johnson an art book from the library. As he leafs through its pages, we are left to wonder what life would be like had we never had the chance to see these magnificent works, what a tragedy it would be, what a smaller, meaner life we would have lived. And a later remark in the film reminds us that seeing is only part of life, that the real joy is in understanding what we have the privilege to experience.The film seems at times like it is hitting the viewer over the head, but it's deeper than that. When Bud takes (Betty Sue?) to Lover's Lane, his first trip there, she offers him some berries as they sit on the grass by the pond. And then she gets up, runs to a nearby tree, picks a shiny red apple, and offers it to him. The metaphor is painfully obvious, but it's supposed to be. We all recognize it. The point is, Bud recognizes it too, and he realizes in that moment that the fact that not all change is good will sooner or later intrude on the lives of these people, which is precisely what then begins to happen in the film. The scene isn't precious for a Do You Get It? Adam & Eve metaphor, it's precious for the look on Bud's face as HE realizes the metaphor being enacted when a beautiful girl offers him a bite of a nice red apple, as his look reveals his thought Uh oh. This is about to get ugly.If you're looking for a groundbreaking thought work, look elsewhere than Pleasantville. It treats a classic theme, not a brand new one. But it does not, in my view, pretend to do more than that, and it treats that theme brilliantly.

But then again, how deep can you go when you're dealing with a romantic comedy? Still, I am yet to understand what all the big hype is about.Tom Cruise delivers an excellent performance as Jerry Maguire, a disgruntled sports agent who loses his job and dignity after having an epiphany about the lack of morals within his basic workplace. He falls for a single mother (Renee Zellweger), simultaneously developing a strong bond with her child and hence embarking on a trip of personal and professional redemption. Cuba Gooding JR is full deserving of his Oscar win as Best Supporting Actor, and Renee Zellweger is solid as always. But that's just about it. A fine cast delivers memorable performances, but what else has this movie got? Crowe's direction is very simple, arguably crossing the line from being unpretentious to boring. The more technical elements of the picture are also mediocre at best, with simple editing and cinematography contributing to what is ultimately a fairly simple film all round. At the end of the film, you are left feeling that what you viewed was practically the same as any other feel-good romantic comedy that you would watch otherwise. The only difference a better cast.I must say here that this film's critical recognition by the Academy is one of the most ridiculous things that I've ever heard of. Sure, the film was OK and simple, but to claim that it stood up even as a nominee against the likes of the brilliant The English Patient and Shine at the 1997 Academy Awards is an insult to that year and illustrates a deterioration of the medium. This is not to say that Crowe is a bad director or that this was, by any means, a terrible film, but it is by no means deserving of the critical hype that accompanied its theatrical release.All in all, a decent romantic comedy with excellent acting and relatively good editing.

Writer Andrew Nicol and director Peter Weir take us into the extraordinary world of Truman Burbank, a sheltered young man with an alleged perfect life whose life, as it is slowly revealed to the viewer, is a 24-7 television show, directed by a God-like dictator (Ed Harris)who has televised and controlled Truman'life from birth and is determined to hold onto Truman even after he has caught onto what is happening. The thing I love about this story is the way it unfolds slowly...the story is told at a leisurely pace and we are only thrown subtle clues at first. There's a wonderful moment where Truman is walking down the street and is almost brained on the head by a spotlight. The expression on Truman's face at seeing a spotlight fall from the sky is just priceless and we are scratching our heads the same way Truman is. Once Truman realizes what is going on, he wants nothing to do with it and attempts to escape. Whether or not Truman escapes is unimportant, what is important is watching Truman trying to figure out what is going on. Jim Carrey redefined his career completely with this completely captivating performance in the title role. Carrey proved that he knew how to do more than pratfalls and mugging with this thoughtful and riveting performance and it was outrageous that Carrey was not nominated for an Academy Award. I don't know about winning but he at least deserved a nomination. Ed Harris, as Cristof, the director of Truman's show, gives the performance of his career that should have won him the Oscar.

The entertainment is here, and it is of a high quality. The relationship between the four dissimilar men --Patterson, Samuel, Angus Starling and the doctor-- provides an intelligent undercurrent of tension to the main theme of the hunt, and the dialog often succeeds in being witty and pointed.

Especially the use of Layla in the whacking scenes of pretty much everyone connected with the Luftansa heist. That has got to be one of the best uses of music in a film, bar none.That being said, I also want to give kudos to the performance of Paul Sorvino-the understated menace of his portrayal of Paul Cicero is something you only start to appreciate after multiple viewings. I've seen this film at least 20 times, and only after my last viewing have I truly come to appreciate his performance.Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci were extremely brilliant of course, but Ray Liotta's portrayal of Henry Hill, IMO, is one of the best ever to grace the screen. One note of brilliance is the last scene in the courtroom, where he gets up off the witness stand and talks directly to the audience, while the other characters remain in the background. Martin Scorcese is a genius, and this scene is one of the best in all of cinema. It's hard for me to single out one thing, because it's rare that a movie contains excellence in so many areas. I can't say enough about this movie, it may be the best film ever made. I can't recommend it enough.

Especially the use of Layla in the whacking scenes of pretty much everyone connected with the Luftansa heist. That has got to be one of the best uses of music in a film, bar none.That being said, I also want to give kudos to the performance of Paul Sorvino-the understated menace of his portrayal of Paul Cicero is something you only start to appreciate after multiple viewings. I've seen this film at least 20 times, and only after my last viewing have I truly come to appreciate his performance.Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci were extremely brilliant of course, but Ray Liotta's portrayal of Henry Hill, IMO, is one of the best ever to grace the screen. One note of brilliance is the last scene in the courtroom, where he gets up off the witness stand and talks directly to the audience, while the other characters remain in the background.

All people, being predisposed towards judgment and classification, struggle to imagine a world that is colorless either in equality or inequality, but in equality making sure to preserve color. Whitewash everything so you get every color put together but none stands out, or whitewash everything so that no color remains at all.Spike Lee focuses most of his energies as a filmmaker into problems of racial tension, and in this, one of his truly breakout films, he analyzes the duality of violence and civic disobedience (and other dualities such as love\/hate) and tries to show how they can or cannot be used. In the best of objective ways, the actually solution is open-ended and unclear we are left with only the picture of Martin Luther King Jr shaking hands and grinning with Malcolm X, in the famous photo which is the only known one of the two activists together.So what do we have to explore this theme with? Well, we have a radio DJ connecting everyone through media self-consciously, as most movies dealing with racial dilemmas tend to include; we have various stereotypes ranging from the old drunk to the ho to the AYE-tahl-lee-ins; and we have a main character named Mookie, played by Spike Lee himself, who is the only self-actualized person in the film and, as a result, is a pompous jerk.Thus, while the heat rises (signifying increasing tension), we have all the fun and revelatory speculation of watching a bunch of stereotypes yell at each other, only occasionally taking a moment to let Mookie give in a word otherwise while he basically abuses them passive aggressively and always gets what he wants, which what he wants is unclear, all until it culminates in the most materialistic of the characters getting together and doing something really, really stupid.Of course it's all very revealing of the state of social tension and the difficulties imposed by multivarious ethnic identities all conglomerated into a whole and attempting to find identity while cutting in to each other to fight the power on their way to self-destruction, and if you don't get that the first ten times the movie says it, it's all summed up in quotes at the end. Or it's just banal. I'm pretty sure most people think of this movie in terms of the former, so I'll just leave it at that.
