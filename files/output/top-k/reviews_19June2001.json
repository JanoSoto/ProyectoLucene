Vertigo is particularly distinctive, both as a complex story filled with suspense, and as a fascinating study in psychological tension.  While it lacks the humor of some of Hitchcock's other masterpieces, and sometimes moves rather slowly, it is unforgettable, and a great achievement by the director and his cast.If you have never seen it, you will enjoy it more if you do not know too much about the plot, although the actual story is somewhat secondary to the ways that the characters are tested and their weaknesses exposed by the various events.  Hitchcock uses a complicated story, interesting characters, lavish visual detail, and deliberate pacing, plus a fine musical score by the incomparable Bernard Hermann, to produce a mysterious, almost unearthly, atmosphere.  The tension rarely lets up, and the viewer is caught up completely in it, at times almost to the point of discomfort.  It's the kind of film that repays careful attention, as almost every moment is filled with significant detail.There are also some great acting performances.  Jimmy Stewart is outstanding in a role far different from his usual screen persona.  He enables the viewer to sympathize completely with him, even as we cringe at many of his character's actions and decisions.  Kim Novak is completely convincing in a difficult dual role, and the movie would not have been as compelling without her fine performance.  The rest of the cast all have much smaller roles, but are all quite good too, especially Barbara Bel Geddes as Scottie's (Stewart's) old friend, who provides important insight into Scottie's character.Vertigo is a classic by any standard.

After realizing that I just loved it all the more.  It is such a culture savy film and it really pushes in your face how insane mass media and pop culture is.  It is a film for people who are influenced by pop culture (just about everyone).  And also people who like to be entertained.  Because the film does go over the top, it uses cliches to it's advantage.  Unlike pearl harbor for instance in which each cliche was met with a groan and rolling of the eyes.

The movie is about this meteor that falls on earth. This meteor suddenly begins to excrete a special liquid that over time, turns into monstrous creatures from outer space which are, well, you know, the bad aliens. Two college teachers, Duchovny and Jones, and one aspiring fireman, Scott, team up to stop them from spreading across the globe, but as you would expect, the government wants to do things their way, so they ignore their valid advice. The movie goes on from there.Throughout the movie, Duchovny acts with really no effort (well, does he ever not?), Jones plays the role of serious\/funny guy perfectly, and Scott does also a good job as the goofy young slacker who follows the guys everywhere.There's this one scene, when this flying alien is in the mall with the three guys trying to capture it, which totally kicked ass. Expect it when you watch the movie.All in all, 'Evolution' is a great movie. Of course it won't win any Oscars or anything (which it should, but those people are stupid...) but it is a movie which entertains you for the whole time, and you'll never wonder what time it is and when you're going home while you're watching it.9 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 June 2001","score":"","review":"  I walked in the theater of this movie expecting a plain old story with a few laughs, and knowing I was going to come out of the theatre saying, ah, could have been better.
