well the solution that the picture offers is worthy as a real intelligent alternative to meaningless effort, worthless and without resolution.The fact that the martians could not breathe our air without themselves dying as a result is not the only accomplishment but one of greater value is that they were in fact the disease to begin with as they sought to conquer in order to survive.That

And upon viewing this on its special edition DVD, my opinion has not changed. This is a film that tries hard but ultimately fails due to poor plotting, sub-par special effects and poor character development. The movie opens with probably the best scene in the film, where you meet Sybok and learn a little about his quest. The visuals alone in the opening shots are very impressive. Then, slowly, scene by scene, the movie falls apart. Yes, there are a few peaks in there, which I will discuss later, but overall, the idea of a God Like Being in the center of our galaxy, it just so illogical.The movie has a lot of embarrassing and just plan bad moments. The first of which is the meeting of three characters who represent the Planet of Galactic Peace. However, their intro is rushed and these characters are not given any depth at all. Why introduce us to these important characters if they care not going to be used in any meaningful (maybe one of them at the end) plot point at all? The direction by William Shatner also seems very uneven. Take the scene with Scotty and Uhura on the bridge. There is a very awkward moment of silence after their main dialogue is over. And the mugging Shatner does when McCoy makes very awkward comments to Spock's story about Sybok is just out of place. And add to that a semi-naked Uhura and Scotty hitting his head for a Three Stooges laugh and you begin to sink in your chair. The Klingon plot seems tacked on just to add depth to the story. And by the time we see where the movie is going, we just feel very disappointed and underwhelmed.That said, I can't help but enjoy the wealth of good character moments in the film. I for one liked the campfire scene and the attempts of deep philosophy about old age and death. I also liked exploring the pain of McCoy and Spock and Kirk's insistence that he needs his pain. While most of the humor was forced and bad, the best had to be the I could use a shower scene, which is one of the biggest laughs in all of the Trek films. There were many moments of good direction by Shatner, especially in McCoy's pain scene. I do sympathize with Shatner a little, when listening to the commentary track, about how this was cut and that was cut but I still think on a whole, this movie was doomed to fail.The DVD's picture is sharp and the sound is excellent. The extras are quite good but I would have liked more insight as to what went wrong with the film besides tight schedule and budget.

This is a film that tries hard but ultimately fails due to poor plotting, sub-par special effects and poor character development. The movie opens with probably the best scene in the film, where you meet Sybok and learn a little about his quest. The visuals alone in the opening shots are very impressive. Then, slowly, scene by scene, the movie falls apart.

The first of which is the meeting of three characters who represent the Planet of Galactic Peace. However, their intro is rushed and these characters are not given any depth at all. Why introduce us to these important characters if they care not going to be used in any meaningful (maybe one of them at the end) plot point at all? The direction by William Shatner also seems very uneven. Take the scene with Scotty and Uhura on the bridge. There is a very awkward moment of silence after their main dialogue is over. And the mugging Shatner does when McCoy makes very awkward comments to Spock's story about Sybok is just out of place. And add to that a semi-naked Uhura and Scotty hitting his head for a Three Stooges laugh and you begin to sink in your chair. The Klingon plot seems tacked on just to add depth to the story. And by the time we see where the movie is going, we just feel very disappointed and underwhelmed.That said, I can't help but enjoy the wealth of good character moments in the film. I for one liked the campfire scene and the attempts of deep philosophy about old age and death. I also liked exploring the pain of McCoy and Spock and Kirk's insistence that he needs his pain. While most of the humor was forced and bad, the best had to be the I could use a shower scene, which is one of the biggest laughs in all of the Trek films. There were many moments of good direction by Shatner, especially in McCoy's pain scene. I do sympathize with Shatner a little, when listening to the commentary track, about how this was cut and that was cut but I still think on a whole, this movie was doomed to fail.The DVD's picture is sharp and the sound is excellent.

It is set in a very alien future of the United States; only everyone is forced to live indoors in a City of Domes. Society is peaceful and fun loving. When you reach 30, you are to renew your life through a ritual or never live again. The story of Logan's Run is quite frightening. Director Michael Anderson does a fantastic job of keeping the frightening aspects of the story going. From the pleasant yet somewhat menacing voice of the main computer to the idea behind the Carousel, you never for a minute doubt what is going on and you really pull for the central characters. The DVD transfer is good, probably as good as they are going to get, because some scenes of the film always looked a little muddy. The enhanced soundtrack is in Dolby and while not 5.1, is still sounds much better than the VHS. The commentary is good but nothing spectacular. And the widescreen is really nice!A word of caution. While the film is rated PG, there are several scenes of brief nudity, one of which really doesn't further the plot any and is unnecessary (in fact, in the commentary, the scene takes the director by surprise and he says he forgot about it). The other is an elaborate scene in the love shop. Despite that, there is very little graphic violence and little to no profanity. Logan's Run is a solid film.

Stanley Kubrik was a genius; he probably knew more about movies than many other of his contemporaries.

Mr. Kubrik's attention to detail and style overshadows the story. The main problem is his screen play, it never involves the viewer in what he is seeing. This is exacerbated by the voice over one hears over the action. We never know what makes these people tick, much less what's going on in their heads at any given moment.The story is told in a flashback.

That old New York that is no longer around, is captured by Mr. Kubrik in such brilliant detail that we mourn the fact those buildings and institutions are not around any more. The night scenes around Times Square, especially the stairway leading to the dance hall have a style that brings some of Edward Hooper's work to mind.

The first part is a drama that involves four young teenagers in the sixties, Hell's Kitchen, New York. They make a stupid mistake that sends them to a reformatory, the Wilkinson home for boys. Here they are sexually abused by the guards including Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon). The second parts is about the revenge the four boys have when they are grown up. If you do not want to know what they're plan is, read no further.Two of the boys, John (Ron Eldard) and Tommy (Billy Crudup), have become killers and one day, 1981, they see Nokes in a restaurant. They walk up to him, shoot him, and leave. The District Attorney who handles their case is Michael (Brad Pitt), one of the four. He has asked for the case, not to win, but to lose. It is time for revenge. Together with Shakes (Jason Patric), the narrator of the story, they come up with a plan to expose events at Wilkinson. Key figures here are John and Tommy's lawyer Snyder (Dustin Hoffman), the girl they all like Carol (Minnie Driver), the Mafia boss from the neighborhood King Benny (Vittorio Gassman), and a priest who has been friends with the four forever, Father Bobby (Robert De Niro). Especially he has a very important role.The first part is very good with four kid actors who are not annoying and a Bacon who is close to pure evil. The way they set up the story is very good as well. We learn to know the kids, King Benny, Father Bobby, the neighborhood. We feel we understand how things work in Hell's Kitchen which is pretty important to make events plausible when the kids have grown up. The second part is not as good but as least as interesting. There are more question we could ask here, but fine actors like De Niro, Hoffman, Pitt and Patric know how to create believable characters. Although what they do might not be the right thing, we somehow hope they pull it off.Director Barry Levinson has made a good film, with 147 minutes a little too long maybe.

Al Capone (played superbly by De Niro) proudly proclaims what a success he is, and that he is in no way involved with any illegal shipments of alcohol, or any violent crime. He denies, very strongly, that he does not kill anyone who refuses to buy his products.The next day, Chicago a little girl goes to boil her water in a local pub, and the owner refuses to a man dressed in white to buy any liquor. He 'accidently' leaves behind his briefcase. The girl notices, and runs out to give it to him, but before she even gets out, the briefcase explodes in her face, as well as destroying the whole pub. The man gets in his car and drives away.Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner, his best performance) is a cop, a recent signing to the Chicago law enforcement team. He's a treasury officer, and on arrival with this news of the bombing, he becomes more eager to get Capone. A meeting with the mother (in an extremely heartfelt scene-trust me, you won't be expecting to cry so early on) really shows him what this man, Capone, is doing to the city. He's a crook, and he must be stopped.But his first assignment is a complete bust. Instead of picking up the alcohol, he gets the umbrellas, and becomes the laughing stock of the whole department. Not only does this hugely embarrass Ness, it fuels Capone to hilarity- thus is the start of a feud that will end more than one life...This film is superb on so many levels. As well as the action set pieces being excellent (if surprisingly violent- for its time, how did this get a UK '15' certificate) but it also has a majestic and epic feel to it. The emotions of both sides are shown and played out marvellously- particularly when Irish Cop Malone (Sean Connery) comes into the picture.Perhaps the most shocking scene, in ways, is the best.

Here's why, plus my notes on this movie 1) Between 1994 and 1998, when this movie was released, the real Cleveland Indians made the playoffs every year and went to the World Series twice. There's no fun, and really no point, in making a movie about underdogs when the real-life team is one of the best in baseball. This is why the producers did not focus on the Tribe, but partially on the then-hapless Minnesota Twins. The only scene where you even see a reference to the Indians is in a Sporting News article Gus is reading while riding the bus, describing the Tribe as contenders.(a side note I've been a die-hard Indians fan for 30 years, so I may sound a bit prejudiced here) 2) I wish we would have known whether the Tribe won the World Series after Major League 2 ended. My guess is no, because I think it would have been mentioned if the Tribe had come out on top. None of the principals (Pedro, Rube, or even Dorn) sport rings in this movie, but even the pennant winners get smaller rings (I've seen the ones the Tribe received for winning the AL pennant in 1995 and 1997...they are very nice indeed).3) We know that Pedro left baseball and came back, now seeking Christianity, apparently with some voodoo mixed in, since a ragged looking Jobu makes a cameo here. Dennis Haysbert, who played Pedro Cerrano in all three movies, could win five Oscars and be hailed as the greatest actor ever, and to me he will ALWAYS be Pedro Cerrano.4) It is mentioned that Rube Baker (Eric Bruskotter, who to me will also be one of Ronald's friends from Can't Buy Me Love), who had a home run and an important double in the ALCS in MLII, had been playing with the San Diego Padres before being released. This indicates that the Indians finally got fed up with his throwing problems and invested in a real catcher.5) Wild Thing and Jake Taylor are nowhere to be seen. My guess is that Ricky Vaughn would have still been with the Tribe, with Jake Taylor as the Indians' manager. They did win a pennant, after all.6) Gus Cantrell (Scott Bakula) must have played with some of these players in the Tribe's minor league system at one time. That's how Pedro, Rube, and Dorn know who he is.7) Roger Dorn (Corbin Bernsen) recovered from having to sell the Tribe in MLII, resurfacing as the owner of the sad-sack Twins. His character is much more mature and likable here. I couldn't stand Dorn in the first two movies.8) Harry Doyle's (Bob Uecker) drinking problem finally caught up with him and forced him out of the Indians' broadcast booth, probably after cursing the Tribe out for losing the World Series. He tells Gus on the bus, after they pull up to the Metrodome, that it had been a while and what a year to quit drinking. It seems that Doyle had finally licked his alcoholism.9) Tanaka apparently took his World Series share and opened that mini golf course you see in the movie. Don't forget, he was a veteran of Japanese baseball when the second one came out, and his part was mostly played for laughs. In 1994, the only player of Japanese origin in the bigs was Hideo Nomo. Now, with Ichiro and others becoming stars, it's almost commonplace. Even the Tribe has Kaz Tadano, a pretty fair relief pitcher, in their system.10) Finally, this movie is better than the second one. It's not as good as the first one, but MLI oozes so many curses and obscenities that I wouldn't let my kids watch it, if I had any. The second one is much cleaner, but halfway through seeing it the first time, I knew it was a bad movie (even though seeing my beloved Cleveland Indians win the pennant on celluloid covers a multitude of sins).

Essentially, he is Luke and probably had no problems filling the role. Another good acting job comes from George Kennedy, who plays Dragline, the most prevalent supporting character and leader of the prisoners before Luke's arrival. He nailed the Cajun accent for the most part and that is no easy task for anyone outside of Louisiana. And although the prison setting and filler characters are for the most part, not realistic, I enjoyed watching Kennedy interact with Luke. Another enjoyable character is the lead guard, a man who always wears aviator sunglasses and never speaks.Basically Luke has never been one to follow the rules, and never will be.

After seeing it I went to IMDb to search for some details about him. I am glad to see that he is a good friend of Neil Young (Neil made the soundtrack for Dead Man, and Jarmusch directed Neil's concert film Year of the Horse). From this point, and the film itself, I think maybe he is also a die-hard hippy like Neil Young. It was the beats first found the Eastern philosophy as a lifesaving, isn't it? The most interesting artwork I have seen on that topic is a novel called Buddha's Bums by that beat guy who also wrote the beat classic On the Road. It is the same guy that also said We here talk about Buddha and Tao everyday but those unadulterated Orientals are studying surrealism. Yes, the 20th century is really a messed up time, when people found that something was corrupt from inner, some of them would self-reflects inside out, and some of them would look out for a specific medicine. I think that's why the east suddenly became paradise for those people. I can understand that instant desire and I admire those who always hold the belief that it's more to the picture than meet the eye and it's better to burn out than to fade away. Although I don't think eastern philosophy is a magic sermon. You know, it always tells you the conclusion without illation, that's why it looks so mystic. And I think the magic also largely depends on the language. Like the Book of Changes (Yi Jing), it is totally untranslatable. Maybe that's why Japanese art is more accepted, because it is mainly from China and has already been digested once. I don't know Japan much but I don't like its over-systematized thoughts. Everything normal could be meaningful at their hands. Like making tea is called tea ceremony there. But have they ever contributed great art just like the Germans (who also famous for their seriousness, I think)? I don't think so. The film itself is a great original film maybe especially for the westerns. The opening reminds me Tom Tykwer's Heaven. Although he transformed Kieslowski's script into a common film but what he added to the opening is great a helicopter pilot drived higher and higher and asked how high should I be?

After watching it, I hope you have a renewed appreciation for what our soldiers went through over there. Whether or not you agree with the purpose of the Vietnam war, our boys deserve our respect and admiration for their sacrifices.Another thing that it's good for is seeing the legendary Pittsburgh steel industry shortly before it collapsed in 1979. There are still a few mills running near Pittsburgh, but nothing like in the past (keeping in mind that Pittsburgh, which is not a large city, produced more steel than Germany and Japan combined during WWII, and the Smokey City was often dark at 300 in the afternoon). Pittsburgh natives will find a bit of nostalgia in this movie, at least, those who are old enough to remember the steel era. There is also a fairly good look inside the Polish culture that is very much alive in Pittsburgh.
