And, wins a well-deserved Oscar for Best Actor. Moreover, Ethan Hawke was nominated for Best Supporting Actor.So, this movie has two great performances to see, as the rogue cop, Alonzo Harris (Washington) takes on the new wannabe narc rookie, Jake (Hawke) on his very first day on the job. And, what a day it is...There are three threads to this complex plot first, Alonzo has the Russian Mafia after him and must deal with the problem or die &#150; there's a contract out on him, and those Russian types just don't mess around; Alonzo also has a group of dirty cops who are getting ready to take down another long-time dirty cop who's been supplying drugs for years &#150; and Alonzo and his gang intend to cash in; and, finally, Alonzo has a do-gooder rookie who thinks he's on the job to actually do good for others, instead of just doing good for himself &#150; money-wise that is.So, where're the real bad guys, you ask? Well, they're either wearing suits and pulling Alonzo's chain in the big end of town or, they're sitting on the sidelines of the really bad areas, waiting for Alonzo and his buddies to mess things up for themselves &#150; so that they can then cash in...A big part of the plot is somewhat artificial because Jake's eventual success, shall I say, on his first day comes only as a result of a very fortuitous co-incidence when he saves a young schoolgirl from an attempted rape. It's a crucial event, and I suppose the screenwriter figured that only one unlikely co-incidence was okay. I guess so...Apart from that, it is a fast paced, beautifully edited and photographed, non-stop, rip-roaring, pulsating, wisecracking, boom and bust, kick-butt action movie that left me dazed after first viewing. A second viewing helped to clear up some of the more confusing details. You might want to watch it twice also, but if you like Denzel, then you'll watch this one at least once.

Three stars from the first film return to their roles; series pin-up Natasha Henstridge, Marg Helgenberger and, of course, the all-action hero Michael Madsen. A sequel to the original film really could have written itself as the door was left wide-open at the end, but instead of following on directly from the first film; we've got a thread about a mission to mars thrown in to further things. Three astronauts go to mars, and one of them comes back infected by alien DNA. The supposed national hero lusts for the recreated 'Sil' (a clone, a bit like Ripley was in Alien 4), who finds herself confined to a high security prison under the command of Dr. Laura Baker. However, when the astronaut begins killing women; the government realise that some serious clean-up work is in order, and proceed to track down Press Lenox; apparently the only man capable of helping to stop the alien.The film doesn't have a lot of depth as aside from letting us into the idea of the alien originating from mars; it's pretty much just a spin-off from the original. Characters from the first film return in identical roles, while new blood such as Mykelti Williamson don't do much to make the film any more interesting on the character front. It's obvious that this film wasn't given big studio backing as it all feels very cheap, and this is mostly down to the rubbish CGI, which was also featured in the original film. In fairness, here it isn't used as often and the effects that don't use computers do look rather nice. There's not a lot of gore on display, but there's some inventive kill scenes and the alien, being based on a H.R. Giger creation, is suitably imaginative. It's a shame that original star Natasha Henstridge is so underused, as her role feels a lot like it's only in the film as a tie to the original; and I'm sure that I'm not the only one who wouldn't have minded seeing more of her. Still, while this film really isn't very good; you can't expect brilliance from a sequel to a minor mid-nineties hit, and I did enjoy watching it.

Though he is arguably a one-trick pony in some ways, (releasing almost only non-linear crime thrillers with poetic dialog and sadistic violence and gore), it has yet to fail him, and sets him on a winning streak with his first film, Reservoir Dogs. Tarantino takes a sub genre of crime films that is tried and true, the heist flick, but adds new touches to it that glow with his brilliant touch. Most heist flicks involve three distinct acts- The setup, the execution, and the fallout- but Tarantino mixes this up; he throws act two out the window completely, leaving the heist a complete mystery save one thing; we know it went horribly, killing one of the six guys and leaving another missing. Secondly, he switches back and forth from the two remaining acts; in one scene, we're with the three survivors, hearing what went wrong and witnessing the flimsy bonds of loyalty slowly unravel. The next, we see the doomed heist come together, watching the characters talk about their plans and joke with one another. These are some of the best scenes in the movie; Quentin is a master at dialog, giving his characters profane poetry exchange in a Shakesperean fashion. Watching grown men sitting around the table talking about top-40 Maddonna, arguing about tipping or pseudonyms, and describing humorous anecdotes from previous jobs is delightful. It really gives a chance for the actors to shine. Steve Buscemi, my perennial favorite, Harvey Keitel, and Tim Roth in particular are incredible, and Chris Penn proves that the acting gene didn't just get passed to Sean.You have to see Reservoir Dogs. It's one of the best movies by one of the best directors of the 90s.

Finally, when he's unexpectedly discovered, instead of letting himself be rescued, he blows up his ship, including himself. The only thing that remains is the last existing forest, drifting through space eternally under a geodesic dome, cared for only by a robot, SAVED FROM MANKIND. This movie quite provokingly asks the question if nature wouldn't be better off without us human beings, and it does not provide an easy answer.

So I was hoping I would like it, and I wanted to like it... but I just can't bring myself to find a lot of redeeming qualities in this film.What we have is a gay couple (Nathan Lane and Robin Williams) who have a grown son, and he is engaged to the daughter (Calista Flockhart) of a powerful conservative senator (Gene Hackman). When the senator gets invited to dinner, things get a little silly.First, the nicest thing I can say is that the film is like a backwards version of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner because the socially acceptable people are entering the home of the social outcasts. But a backwards film exists already called Guess Who, and I don't want to touch that. But anyway, in this context I guess the idea was alright.Hank Azaria is also decent as the very flamboyant male maid (dressed more like a cabana boy). Any other actor doing this and I think the part would have been going over the top (as much of this film does), but Azaria is the kind of guy who makes over the top seem normal. And Calista Flockhart looks about as attractive as she ever could in this movie, which is the nicest thing I can say about her poor acting and usually poor screen presence.The over-the-topness ruins some of what this film was trying to do, because it makes gays out to be extremely unlike other people, which I don't generally think is true. So if we are supposed to get a feel for gay lifestyles, why not make one more realistic? And the senator is just as cliché as a conservative senator (though I think he might be closer to reality than Nathan Lane is).But worst of all about this film is the way the families interact. It is unbelievable and becomes more and more so as the film goes on. I know this is a comedy, but there were many key life lessons and dramatic scenes that were just completely defecated upon because the film put comedy and weak writing in places we absolutely did not need it.This film fails, but as least it has Gene Hackman... the only reason I didn't give it less than a 5.

So I was hoping I would like it, and I wanted to like it... but I just can't bring myself to find a lot of redeeming qualities in this film.What we have is a gay couple (Nathan Lane and Robin Williams) who have a grown son, and he is engaged to the daughter (Calista Flockhart) of a powerful conservative senator (Gene Hackman). When the senator gets invited to dinner, things get a little silly.First, the nicest thing I can say is that the film is like a backwards version of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner because the socially acceptable people are entering the home of the social outcasts. But a backwards film exists already called Guess Who, and I don't want to touch that. But anyway, in this context I guess the idea was alright.Hank Azaria is also decent as the very flamboyant male maid (dressed more like a cabana boy). Any other actor doing this and I think the part would have been going over the top (as much of this film does), but Azaria is the kind of guy who makes over the top seem normal.

Can we really ever escape, do we want those around us to find a life or happiness unless we can as well.Horror fans, comedy fans and those who love romantic dramas all should go now and get this movie and watch it at least once a year - it really is that great.The cast is awesome, how could anyone not enjoy Rupert Everette - He shines on camera.

Probably the funniest disaster movie parody is The Cassandra Crossing, but that was intended to be a serious film and only counts as a parody because it was so badly made. The best-known deliberate disaster movie spoof is Airplane from 1980, but four years earlier there was The Big Bus. The opening voice-over makes it clear what the film's targets are, as there are obvious implied references to The Poseidon Adventure, Earthquake, The Towering Inferno and The Hindenburg.The plot concerns the maiden journey (from New York to Denver) of the world's first nuclear powered bus and the attempts that are made to sabotage it on behalf of the oil industry. Straight disaster movies are often based around the concept of a motley collection of people, brought together by chance, who are forced to work together by the threatened disaster. The Big Bus seizes hold of this concept and takes it to the limit. The passengers include a priest who has lost his faith (his arguments in favour of atheism include the claim that a just God would have given the devout old lady next to him a window seat rather than an aisle seat), an about-to-be-divorced couple who bicker constantly when they are not trying to seduce one another, and a man who has only six months to live and constantly reminds everyone of the fact.The crew are just as eccentric as the passengers; Dan the driver (who is also the ex-boyfriend of the bus's female designer) is a suspected cannibal, although he defends himself by claiming that he only ever ate a single foot. (You eat one lousy foot and they call you a cannibal. What a world!) The co-driver (named Shoulders because of an unfortunate tendency to drive on the shoulders of the road) also has an even more unfortunate tendency to fall asleep at the wrong moment, including while driving. There is also a scantily-dressed stewardess named (satirising the American fondness for double-barrelled Christian names) Mary-Jane-Beth-Sue and an appallingly tactless and tasteless piano player.Some of the humour in The Big Bus comes from sending up the conventions of the genre, such as exaggeratedly portentous music or the scene (probably inspired by The Poseidon Adventure) where Dan has to rescue his ex-girlfriend Stockard Channing from drowning in soft drinks. Its targets, however, range wider than the confines of the disaster genre. The faithless priest Father Kudos, for example, is an obvious reference to Father Karras in The Exorcist, and the use of the opening theme from Richard Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra may echo its earlier use in Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey. The scene where the bus is left seesawing on the edge of a cliff is taken from the ending to The Italian Job. Indeed, the film's range of targets is not confined to the cinema. The constant mentions of cannibalism seem to be a reference to Piers Paul Read's book Alive!, about a plane crash in the Andes, which was a bestseller in the seventies but which was not made into a film until 1993.Perhaps it was this scattergun approach, firing off its satirical bullets in all directions, which meant that I did not find the film particularly funny. It might have worked better if it had concentrated on sending up the disaster genre and had not tried to cram in so many extra targets. When you are aiming at so many targets, you need to hit them all, and too many of the bullets are either duds or fly harmlessly wide. For every funny joke there are several unfunny ones.

Murhpy's wife and son were brought into perspective in the first Robocop but in this sequel, they are really forgotten after the first 15 minutes due to the fact that OCP wants him to forget about the fact that he ever was Alex Murphy and concentrate on solely what he was built for. So this movie has somewhat of an absence emotionally at times and really concentrates more on the loud torcherous violence, making it supremely entertaining on the happy note. Peter Weller thankfully reprises his role as Murphy and just as in the first was great, he really gives the character a great zing, with his deep metallic voice, something that all the other actors to have portrayed Robocop have lacked and just don't seem believable in anyway, but it's not only that, Weller can make the character real and life like. He can make something that seems so unreal and unhumanlike and turn it into one of us, without doubt he's the best Murphy out there.The story in this sequel is simple, a new drug is sweeping the country called Nuke, highly addictive and it's up to Murphy to put a stop to it but after a run in with the Nuke Lord Cain (played by Tom Noonan)has him dissembled(a really hard scene to watch to warn fans out there), there's consideration as to replacing Murphy in which he eventually does though he gets rebuilt.

And even though the trip ends very badly for our heroines, it's hard to feel unsatisfied. They made their point and ended the game on their own terms. As close to victory as anyone in their situation could hope for.Could Thelma have aimed more carefully and avoided any need to flee in the first place? Could they have ignored the hitchhiker, thus avoiding landing in further hot water? Of course. But where's the fun in that?

When the average person thinks of movies with a Western theme, they will most likely recall the spaghetti trilogy by Sergio Leone and the several other films with Clint Eastwood that were influenced by it. After Leone and other European directors sank their teeth into this American niche, the earlier images of dandy cowboys, packed saloons, and neatly-arranged gun duels became cartoonish and subjects of parody.Although largely based on Akira Kurosawa's samurai film 'Yojimbo,' Sergio Leone still took the American Western in a different direction with 'Per un pugno di dollari' AKA 'Fistful of Dollars.' Leone made use of realist trends popular during the mid to late 1960s, bringing a new grittiness and level of violence to the screen. And of course, 'Fistful of Dollars' led to arguably the two greatest Westerns ever made, 'For a Few Dollars More' and 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,' both standards for action film-making.While not as successful as the other films of Leone's trilogy, 'Fistful of Dollars' is highly effective as an action tale. The script written by no fewer than ten people (including Leone and Clint Eastwood) has obvious plot gaps and is rather predictable, but Leone is very much at ease with his material and generates levels of drama that were rare in previous Westerns. Clint Eastwood, known only for smaller Western roles up to this point, is also teeming with the cold-blooded aura that made his name in cinema history.'Fistful of Dollars' lasts just one hour and 40 minutes, following Eastwood's nameless bounty hunter with his familiar cigar and poncho. Eastwood is out for cash besides toting an innate sense of justice, however brutal it may seem. At the film's opening, he rides into a Mexican border town called San Miguel, where two desperado families named the Rojos and Baxters are fighting for control of a trade route linking Mexico to the United States. Eastwood's motivation to set things right is found in Marisol (Marianne Koch), a young woman who has been taken by Ramón Rojo (Gian Maria Volontè) as a sex slave after her husband was accused of cheating in a poker game. Eastwood's deeds are unconventional, serving as an informant to both sides and playing the families off one another until they are wiped out and the 'disease' of the town has been eradicated.Eastwood's role as self-serving killer makes him a different type of antihero, one who draws the viewer's sympathies yet rests above and beyond the limits of normal behavior. This character is a tough one to bring off, but it completely works in 'Fistful of Dollars.' While we know very little about the character as a man, there are revealing moments that flesh him out and make him human. For instance, he is clearly against gratuitous violence and has a sense of humor in even the most dire situation. These will become motifs of Eastwood in his later roles, notably in the other Leone films and the 'Dirty Harry' series.Although this is clearly Eastwood's movie, the supporting cast is very good. Gian Maria Volontè easily gets under our skin as a trigger-happy playboy. The two townsfolk who befriend Eastwood are saloonkeeper Silvanito (José Calvo) and bearded mortician Piripero (Austrian actor Joseph Egger, who appears in 'For a Few Dollars More'); while not sidekicks, both men give humorous turns as his supporters. Antonio Prieto is demure as Rojo family head Don Miguel, while the female roles are adequately held by Marianne Koch and Margarita Lozano.As you would expect, Leone's film is heavily stylized, using frame-filling close-ups and perspectives that were unusual for its time. The cinematography of Massimo Dallamano and Federico Larraya is rich in detail, clearly showing the grain of wood, the dirt of trails, and the sky's azure. Roberto Cinquini and Alfonso Santacana provide decent editing and the sound by Elio Pacella is clear as a bell. Unfortunately, the dubbing of non-English actors is sub-par, but it is no worse than other European films of the 1960s. Ennio Morricone, a former classmate of Leone, uses a traditional orchestra and the wordless chorus that became his much-imitated trademark.For those wanting to grasp the impact of spaghetti Westerns, there is no better place to start than with 'Fistful of Dollars,' which should be viewed before the other films in Leone's trilogy and his landmark 'Once Upon a Time in the West.' 'Fistful' is available as a separate DVD and as part of a 'Man With No Name' boxed set from MGM\/UA Home Video. The film is presented in dual letter box and standard format, although you would be crazy not to watch 'Fistful' in its original aspect ratio. The MGM print is in very good condition with distinguishable colors and few artifacts. English and French subtitles are provided with Dolby enhancement of the original mono track. MGM has once again provided the theatrical trailer as an extra and nothing more.

Eastwood's deeds are unconventional, serving as an informant to both sides and playing the families off one another until they are wiped out and the 'disease' of the town has been eradicated.Eastwood's role as self-serving killer makes him a different type of antihero, one who draws the viewer's sympathies yet rests above and beyond the limits of normal behavior. This character is a tough one to bring off, but it completely works in 'Fistful of Dollars.' While we know very little about the character as a man, there are revealing moments that flesh him out and make him human. For instance, he is clearly against gratuitous violence and has a sense of humor in even the most dire situation. These will become motifs of Eastwood in his later roles, notably in the other Leone films and the 'Dirty Harry' series.Although this is clearly Eastwood's movie, the supporting cast is very good. Gian Maria Volontè easily gets under our skin as a trigger-happy playboy. The two townsfolk who befriend Eastwood are saloonkeeper Silvanito (José Calvo) and bearded mortician Piripero (Austrian actor Joseph Egger, who appears in 'For a Few Dollars More'); while not sidekicks, both men give humorous turns as his supporters. Antonio Prieto is demure as Rojo family head Don Miguel, while the female roles are adequately held by Marianne Koch and Margarita Lozano.As you would expect, Leone's film is heavily stylized, using frame-filling close-ups and perspectives that were unusual for its time. The cinematography of Massimo Dallamano and Federico Larraya is rich in detail, clearly showing the grain of wood, the dirt of trails, and the sky's azure. Roberto Cinquini and Alfonso Santacana provide decent editing and the sound by Elio Pacella is clear as a bell. Unfortunately, the dubbing of non-English actors is sub-par, but it is no worse than other European films of the 1960s. Ennio Morricone, a former classmate of Leone, uses a traditional orchestra and the wordless chorus that became his much-imitated trademark.For those wanting to grasp the impact of spaghetti Westerns, there is no better place to start than with 'Fistful of Dollars,' which should be viewed before the other films in Leone's trilogy and his landmark 'Once Upon a Time in the West.' 'Fistful' is available as a separate DVD and as part of a 'Man With No Name' boxed set from MGM\/UA Home Video. The film is presented in dual letter box and standard format, although you would be crazy not to watch 'Fistful' in its original aspect ratio. The MGM print is in very good condition with distinguishable colors and few artifacts. English and French subtitles are provided with Dolby enhancement of the original mono track. MGM has once again provided the theatrical trailer as an extra and nothing more. Surely, there is an interview of Leone and Eastwood out there somewhere.Take note that many of the cast and crew members are listed with American-sounding aliases in the opening credits.*** out of 4 ","genre":"Action, Drama, Western"},{"date":"9 October 2006","score":"21 out of 26 people found the following review useful","review":" This was kind of a strange, low-key movie, one that isn't going to get a lot of attention, especially with a younger audience which wants anything but a slow- moving story.

No, instead it's a uniquely-made (not necessarily a good thing) movie that just had masterful marketing. Before it came out, many people honestly believed that it was real. Even after they learned it was not, they were still intrigued by the eerie advertisements and the unique premise. Coming out in 1999 amid the backlash against of big-budget, visual FX-heavy blockbusters like Godzilla (1998) and The Phantom Menace also likely benefited this low-budget film.I'm not some stupid kid looking for tons of ridiculous gore in a horror movie. I can understand the idea that sometimes it's what you don't see that scares you. However, I also believe that you do have to see SOMETHING, even if it's just a little, to be scared.All this movie shows is a trio of stupid kids running around lost in the woods. Occasionally they freak out after hearing spooky sounds, that's basically it. Oh yeah, at one point they find a bunch of little wooden arts and crafts hung on some tree branches. Real scary.The plot is nonexistent, as is the backstory (I hear it's provided in a sequel which dispensed with the unique first-person video camera perspective, and was just a plain old crappy horror movie). You NEVER learn what the Blair Witch is, or even if that's what's behind the things that go on in the movie.The characters are stupid and unlikable kids. I heard that the no-name actors were told to improvise their scenes, to make things more realistic. Believe me, it shows. There's an entire scene where the three characters do nothing but scream F*** you! This movie which supposedly reinvigorated the sagging horror genre is completely overrated. There's not a single real scare in it, and the story and writing is pathetic. Save yourself the time and rental fees by passing on this film.

Well, you'd better believe that they go all out. The story picks up fifty-seven years after the original, and sure enough, there are more aliens. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), however, is not to be deterred. If those drooling fiends are around, she's ready to take them on.I should say that the movie seems a little silly at times. Since this is an action flick, there are a number of army types, and they all have their macho lingo. Fortunately, Aliens doesn't pretend to be anything but an action flick. If anything, the little girl adds a sort of humanizing aspect to the kick-ass stuff. But this is definitely a guy movie, albeit one carried by a woman. If I may say so, Weaver becomes as much of a bad-ass here as she was in Ghost Busters (of course, this time she's not possessed).Anyway, this movie has something for everyone, and you're sure to like it. Really cool. Also starring Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton and Paul Reiser.I wonder whatever became of Carrie Henn.
