It is about an American writer, Stingo, who meets a remarkable woman, Sophie Zawistowski, and her lover, Nathan Landau. They form a sort of unexpected touching friendship, and they struggle with their past, and Sophie reveals her hidden truths and her lies. This film is very dialogue-filled, so some people might get restless, but the way the three characters bond is very uprising. I loved that is was a very unexpected film. It really did not have a particular plot, but more of a look at these peoples' lives. The way Sophie has to remember her past, the way she is tormented affects both Nathan and Stingo, since Nathan sort of has personality issues.The character of Sophie is played by Meryl Streep. She gives probably the best subtly done performance by a female I have ever seen. Her acting is not over-the-top, and she hands it on with grace. Of course, since this character has a lot to hide, she has to play it sort of tormented and afraid. Meryl Streep commands the screen, with all her character's characteristics and traits. She plays it straight from the heart, and she gives the most emotional acting I have ever seen. Peter MacNicol, who plays Stingo, I thought played him very naturally. He was such a like-able character,and his acting and narration carried the film forward. He deserved some Oscar nomination. Kevin Kline also plays his part well as Nathan, in a supporting performance.Sophie's Choice might be called as a draining film, since there is a lot of themes that would be found in a life story. I personally loved it. There were some flaws in the screenplay, like some certain occurrences, but overall, it fit well for what it was trying to do. It was a human study in war and humanity, and how people might be affected in past choices. It was a very in-depth film, and that is why I liked it so much. The classic performance by Meryl Streep is one not to be forgotten, and I think as a whole, the film rises and shines to what makes people themselves in real life. The ending was so emotional and powerful... A Masterpiece that gets too much hate...

After movies that he made back in Finland and brilliant What's Eating Gilbert Grape I think that my expectations were justified. Sadly, this movie came just behind Gilbert so I can live with one mediocre movie after a huge success with Gilbert and then later movie like The Cider House Rules, Chocolat... Hallström likes to make family movies, where he can expose the whole family with all their pluses and minuses. In this case, story was written by Callie Khouri (Thelma & Louise), typical 'women are always good' writer. In the middle of the story we've got Grace Bichon (Julia Roberts), who founds out that her husband Eddie (Dennis Quaid) is unfaithful. With her daughter, she decides to come back home at ranch. There she must face her traditional father Wyly (Robert Duvall) and mother Georgia (Gena Rowlands), who seems to be doing whatever Wyly wants. The only person who fully understands her is her sister Emma Rae (Kyra Sedgwick).I disagree that there is nothing to talk about in this movie. Yes, this movie has some obvious problems the script is not brilliant which is mostly seen in situations that we've all seen before and characters like Eddie, Wyly and Georgia are written on a way that there is nothing for actors to act. But all Hallström characters are alive (you can identify with them) and about family problems that are presented in this movie there is plenty to talk about. For example, what strong woman like Grace does when she's cheated, how to explain her young daughter that her dad isn't living with them any more; the whole relationship of Bichon's after infidelity. On the other hand, we've got relationship between two sisters, between Wyly and Georgia King and so on. So we've got plenty stuff to talk about only if you think about it for a while. What this script lacks is quality writing of male characters. Duvall's and Quaid's characters are simply not developed enough.About acting part, I must admit that Julia Roberts is very good in this role, just like Kyra Sedgwick and Brett Cullen (his character is the only male character that is made right). Duvall, Rowlands & Quaid have nothing to act, like I said before. But I read one comment that says that Duvall shouldn't act in any movie. That is what made me angry so I had to write it. Man is a screen and stage legend! So to end, if you can watch this family drama about marriage, infidelity and love. It's not the best choice coming from Hallström but it's a bearable one.

We always wonder what would happen if we die in our dreams, well, a nightmare on elm street answer that question in the most macabre way. The cast is fabulous, starting with the villain Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund from Eaten Alive and V), the heroin Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp)and the beginning of a amazing actor witch plays Glen (Johnny Depp), the heroin's boyfriend. Wes Craven's work is one in a lifetime, the effects are amazing, making this movie looked like it was big budget production.

All the energy spent with the will of wanting to make this movie is felt during the hole time.The sequels Well, as usually, if the formula works it will comeback for more! In this case, the numbers of sequels is a little bit too much for the character Freddy Krueger, because sequel after sequel the character became too much of a joker, instead the sarcastic killer from the first movie. One of the biggest mistakes of New Line Cinema was as the Budget grew, we started to see more detailed Krueger's face, witch made the character more exposed and less scary. Freddy's Revenge is probably where the ambient is similar to the original, Krueger is still in the dark, half hidden by the shadows of darkness and although after the sequel it's not my favorite part, is one of my favorites. As the character started to loose the audience, new line cinema started to loose control over Freddy's character, until the creator Wes Craven came with Wes Craven's New Nightmare, refreshing the franchise. In my opinion, Freddy is dead and he should stay that way in sign of respect for what he has given to New Line Cinema! The remake news that Robert Englund is not going to play Freddy Krueger only makes us (fans) wonder that New Line Cinema couldn't care less for the importance that the character had for the studio, and if it wasn't for Freddy, Lord of The Rings would probably be made by another studio.

Anyway back to the film, it's better then going to any circus I have ever been to or seen anywhere before. DeMille's voice as narrator is amazing and makes everything he says feel grander and epic. The cast was good but were more of a back up to the spectacle. Heston does his best work of the film towards the end and Stewart is great as always. I only wish these two would have shared more screen time or gone on to star in another movie together, two amazing talents. I have heard this movie be lumped into conversations about the worst best picture winners ever and I could not disagree more. The only other movie I have seen from that year was Singin' in the Rain which is also very good but no where near the epic feel. As you can tell by now I am a sucker for epics especially older ones of this kind simply because I am amazed by the planning, vision, patience and determination it would have taken back then to make a film of this scope.

Oldman & Bacon, along with the rest of the cast, must have slid under their chairs if they went to the screening. As one poster pointed out, Karen Young did do a pretty good fight scene with Bacon. She really did 'let loose'.

Spider-Man, The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers, and of course, The Bourne Identity.It's one of the few action films in the last decade or so to really make you think. It's got twists. It's got turns. It's got Matt Damon. What it doesn't have is a shaky camera.Now, bare with me. I'm saying that in a more scornful tone than you might imagine. A lot of people don't like Supremacy or Ultimatum because of the shaky camera work. I, however, like to down Identity for NOT having shaky camera work. Why? There are several reasons.First, The Bourne series is one that should make you think while having your heart pounding to near-explosion at the same time. It should push both of your most valuable organs to boiling-point. Without a camera that moves around as if you were struggling to run just like the characters, I doubt your heart will race very far.Second, Bourne is like an animal. He moves on instinct alone, because that's all he was left with. Now, I don't know about you, but the normal camera work in Identity makes the film and the character seem too... tame. Too solitary, despite the violence. A camera can change more than most people realize in a film.Thirdly, the shaky cam is definitive of the Bourne series, at least in the last two. Every action series has something another doesn't. And what the Bourne series has is A) an excellent storyline, B) realistic character development, C) believable government action, and D) shaky camera work.So in that, I find that Identity is just too tame to really capture the true Bourne. In other words, the Identity is lost until it is found in Supremacy. It feels just like 'The Italian Job' with the 'tame' camera. Maybe it's because Bourne is still a white-knight good guy in this one. He wants to be tame.Otherwise, The Bourne Identity is the fantastic beginning to an excellent and enthralling trilogy. It's got the best romance story in any of them, and quite possibly the most believable characters in any action film. I'm glad the helm was passed to Paul Greengrass from Doug Liman, who went on to do decent work with 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' and 'Jumper'.It's fantastic, and that ending song, 'Extreme ways' by Moby is just too damn catchy to miss.

In the United States, there were reports of mentally unstable women, usually those who had a bad experience with the birth of a child or the child was aborted for some reason, who broke into homes where other women lived with their newborns, leading them to murder the mother and kidnap the child. In those cases, the kidnapper\/murderer was arrested by the authorities. However, in one other incident, the kidnapper\/murderer committed suicide.When Sasha Hails character invites Tatiana (Marina de Van) into her beach side home, she invites her own death and the kidnapping of her little Samantha (played by Hails' real life daughter, who was born prior to the making of the film). What Francois Ozon does well is to slowly unravel the Tatiana character's intentions as the film progressed. Even Sasha finds out late in the story about the real person behind the backpacker who admitted that she had lost her child. To make matters worse, Sasha is a victim of her naivety.Amazingly, this film lasts only 51 minutes. You would think that this thriller would go, at least 90 minutes, but not enough material was written to extend the movie's length. However, I would have been happy to have seen the kidnapper\/murderer get caught by the police to put closure on the case. But the film ends with a crime committed, the perpetrator running free with the baby. Apparently, European films deal more with unsolved answers to problems than finding solutions. How sad.

Batman was followed by a sequel in 1992 which was more darker than the first film although the movie was criticised for being a little bit too dark and depressing, Tim Burton once again was the director and Michael Keaton was once again Batman\/ Bruce Wayne. Batman Returns was a box office success but wasn't has successful has the first Batman film. Years later Warner Brothers decided to make a third Batman movie, this time instead of being dark and gritty like the previous two films it returned to the campy style of the 1960's Batman show. Tim Burton was producer but replaced has director by Joel Schumacher who had previously made the 1980's horror cult classic The Lost Boys, Michael Keaton who had previously played Batman was replaced by Val Kilmer. Jim Carry was cast to give the movie a more kid friendly tone, Tommy Lee Jones was cast as the other villain Two Face, Nichole Kidman was cast has Batman's love interest and Chris O'Donnel was cast as Batman's sidekick Robin. With this big cast Batman Forever was hyped to be the best out the series and of course Batman Forever was a box office success although it did receive mixed reviews from critics. Batman Forever was the Batman movie Warner Brothers wanted, it was safe and profitable. This however wasn't the same with Batman & Robin.Anyway on with my review. I remember hearing about Batman Forever and being sicked to see it, I saw Batman Forever in the cinemas with my parents and brothers and was completely disappointed with it. I was five years old and I preferred the dark style of the original two Tim Burton Batman films, we actually walked out of the cinemas after the first half hour of the film. Years later I watched the movie again, being older I watched it with a open mind. I must admit it's not has bad as I remembered it but it's still not the best Batman movie, it's just a little bit better than Batman & Robin. The one problem with this movie is that it's lost the dark style of the first two films for a more campy kid friendly style, while the first two were dark and bleak this one is bright and colourful. Another problem with this film is that it does seem a bit too silly, the Riddler acts too zany and Two Face acts like a campy villain. Another thing is Val Kimler's performance has Batman and Bruce Wayne, he's no replacement for Michael Keaton. He doesn't have that same presence Michael Keaton had. That said Batman Forever did have it's good points such has the costumes, they did look pretty cool. The Vechiles were also good and the action although a bit more over the top was okay. The good thing is that now the Batman movies have returned to the dark and gritty style with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.Batman Forever does have it's moments but it's not has good as Batman and Batman Returns, younger viewers may like this film more than the older viewers. Fans of Batman may want to check this film out but don't expect it to be like the darker Batman films.

Still my #1 favorite movie.On a side note, I'm sure most of you know Glen Hansard, who played Outspan in the movie won an Academy Award for Best Original Song this year from the movie Once. I bought the movie used at Blockbuster for $5,just on the strength of the box's liner notes. I loved the movie, but had no clue the male lead was Outspan. But the more I looked at his facial expressions, especially his eyes, I kept saying to myself,God, I know this guy! Picked up my Commitments DVD, but no actors names were on the box, so I got my Commitments CD Soundtrack out and sure enough, Glen Hansard's name was listed. If you haven't seen the movie(Once)give it a try. It's got some great songs in it( almost all original, written by Glen and his co-star Marketa Irglova) Well, that's enough for me.
