[{"date":"17 June 2001","score":"61 out of 72 people found the following review useful","review":"  9 OUT OF 10!!!! We went to catch the matinee preview of Shrek. We were still giggling by the time we got home afterwards. Two hours later, we dragged a friend out and went back for the evening show. Some of the shock value was lost, but we caught a few of the background sight gags we missed the first time, and anticipation of some of the other scenes had us in tears before they even happened. Interesting to see the different audience reactions of different age groups, too. This is a *very* funny movie, but it should be noted that most of the kiddy humour is on the burp\/fart and yucky dining habits level - Shrek is rather closely related to Raymond Briggs' Fungus the Bogeyman without the orange mohawk. The dialogue and main action quips are mainly aimed at adults and sophisticated kids. One little voice in the afternoon audience piping up WHAT's he compensating for? cracked me up...Be warned that this movie is a non-stop send-up of all things Disney. If predictability and saccharine is your cup of tea, you may not like it. On the other hand, if you are cynical about theme parks and like the idea of fairytale classics getting the Monty Python treatment, you'll love it. Every time a scene looks familiar, it means it is about to go pear-shaped. And it's not just old classics that get the treatment. I spotted (mis)quotes from films that are just being released, both Disney and non-Disney. You name it, it gets an affectionate pie in the face at some point in Shrek.As a fairytale, however offbeat, Shrek is tighter plotted and better characterised than most Hollywood dross.The parodic twists, a love story subplot that owes more to Shakespeare's comedies than fairytale formula, and the ugly is the new beautiful Message more than make up for the derivativeness due to extensive quotation.As for the acting, confinement to voice-overs keeps the egos of Myers and Murphy in check, and they do a fantastic job as the big fat green smelly recluse and the obnoxiously manic donkey respectively. Diaz is great as a feisty princess who reminds me of Lloyd Alexander's Eilonwy crossed with Lara Croft. Lithgow's Farquaad is a wonderful Bad Guy, modelled on Olivier's Richard III apart from his Little Problem being different. And the Fairytale Creatures...excellent, all of them. The graphics, of course, are state of the art for at least another 2 weeks. We're talking freckles, skin pores and stubble, pupil dilation, and amazing light-and-shade. They had to tone down the realism of the humanoids to stop them looking creepily android-like.Highly recommended, except for overly precious schmalz addicts.

This movie is actually pretty good, although it recycles plots and other items from other sci-fi movies.For starters, the entire plot is a copy of the movie Stargate (1994). Both of the movies start off with a promising linguist (or whatnot) that wants acceptance from the scholarly community.  They, of course, are rejected because of their fanastical ideas and theories; they, however, get an offer to follow through their theories.  Boom.  They end up being right. But there's a catch their companions actually have their own agenda, which usually means the death of others, etc. etc.  The good guys save the day and our hero stays with the chick.  Yea.  What a complete ripoff, espcially since Stargate came out 7 years ago.  However, I do admit that most movies take ideas from other previous movies.  Except this movie just outdid it a little.Another thing that I noticed was the leviathan from the depths of the water in Iceland was a ripoff of Star Wars Episode One.How is it that in this movie, there were giant submarines and little one-man subs with weapons?  Atlantis was set in 1914 and they have more advanced ships than we do in the 21st century.I've noticed that the general trend in those kiddie Disney movies is that the human characters are disproportional.  For starters, in Sleeping Beauty, Briar Rose had a one millimeter waist.  However, the proportionality did get slightly better in Mulan.  However, in Atlantis, the bodies did not look extremely realistic.But hey, don't get me wrong.  I still like the movie.  I like both of Stargate and Atlantis.  I just believe that now that we're in the 21st century, there should be some more unique plots.  No movie should ever copy the same plots it takes away from the excitement of the movie.  However, there are many positive merits from this movie.  One of the things that I loved about this movie was that the characters did NOT break out into song every two minutes.  The movie is a lot more fluid without the constant singing.  There was quite a bit of action and intrigue in this movie; it did keep me on my toes throughout the movie.All in all, the movie was pretty good it did not conform to the usual Disney movie form of singing every two minutes.  However, if you want an extremely original plot, then this is not the movie for you.  I would recommend that you save your $9 and rent the movie when it comes out four months from you.
