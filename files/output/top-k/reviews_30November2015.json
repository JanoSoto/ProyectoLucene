[{"date":"30 November 2015","score":"","review":" Mystery, Alaska (1999) Dir Jay Roach \/ Cast Russell Crowe, Burt Reynolds, Colm Meaney, Hank Azaria, Mary McCormack Yet another sports film about the succeeding smaller factor. Russell Crowe plays a Sheriff who also plays ice hockey but he never goals. Burt Reynolds plays a judge who is disappointed with his son's choices. Colm Meaney plays the Mayor whose wife is having an affair. Finally there is Hank Azaria who returns to town. Crowe dislike him because he dated his wife in high school. Directed by Jay Roach but still a recycled and predictable plot. This is a switch in gears for the director who previously gave us Austin Powers. Russell Crowe is inspiring casting as someone whose love for hockey never deteriorated despite never having the talent to pull it off professionally. Now he feels his marriage threatened with the return of an ex. Hank Azaria succeeds as someone whose presence is not welcome until he comes to full revelation as to what is important. Burt Reynolds and Colm Meaney play characters with the background but not the payoff so they merely become props to formula storytelling. Mary McCormack plays the romantic interest caught between Crowe and Azaria. Despite the hockey action the production features little innovation and can pass only on its small town atmosphere. Advertised as a comedy but plays as an ensemble dramatic Mighty Ducks.
