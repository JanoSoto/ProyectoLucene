For unlike most so-called creative types attempting to sell to, or worse yet cynically exploit, children nowadays, Jim never seemed to really forget what it was like to be a child. And if there ever was a moment in which he demonstrated this, Labyrinth aside, it is 1979's Muppet Movie. Filmed as an allegorical story about how Henson came to work in children's television as a puppeteer and ended up with a half-hour show of his own on primetime television, The Muppet Movie ends up an affirmation of everything more progressive, understanding sorts would say to children who did not quite meet the expected norm during the 1980s. And as we enjoy the fruits of an era in which we are gagged and bound from speaking about anything lest someone might get offended, the open celebration of difference or diversity that formed a large part of The Muppet Show is on offer here. I have said it in other comments, but I must say it here. A great light in the world went out the day Jim Henson died.The Muppet Movie begins with its cast sitting down to see the premiere of what were about to see for the next eighty or so minutes. In short, precise strokes, we are introduced to the major players as well as some of the minors. And when the story proper begins, boy are we given a great song to bring us into the moment. The Rainbow Connection painted both a beautiful and sad image of what the Muppets, especially Kermit, were. These were not just a bunch of felt puppets with singular personalities who combined to put on a show. They were living things based upon a part of all of us, only writ so much more boldly than we are used to. As each Muppet was introduced to us in turn, we saw another reflection of part of ourselves, and of course the children in the audience would respond differently to each character. Hence, everyone had a favourite. When Animal appeared behind a drum kit and attempted to eat a cymbal, I knew I had found one of mine. Nowadays, I am more of a Swedish Chef fan, but what the hey.Complementing the characters was a string of musical numbers that further developed their motivations and personalities. Can You Picture That? shared an insight into Dr. Teeth and his band as well as the creative soul of Henson. But the most relevant song to me was Gonzo's number, asking what he is and where he came from. Many of us would spend a lifetime gazing into the stars and, like Gonzo, saying we knew we would be going back there someday. Not that all the songs were so deadly serious, of course. Fozzy and Kermit share a number after they decide to combine their talent (or lack thereof) and hit the road. If any evidence were required that present-day musicians have lost the ability to use the pop structure to create something listenable, this number would be it. Never before, and never again, would the group dynamic of a cast and the music so perfectly complement one another. With the puppeteers and voice actors so perfectly on top of their game, the human cast had a lot to live up to.Which makes it all the more amazing that the human element also lived up to their end of the deal. Cameos literally pepper the film, with everyone from Steve Martin to Telly Savalas popping in to offer their support. Even Richard Pryor, the last man one would expect to see in a film about the Muppets, appears to set up a hilarious moment. Mel Brooks' cameo is just as disturbing to me as an adult as it was when I was a small boy, but I suspect that is because Henson knew why I would find it disturbing now. The big acting strength, though, comes from Charles Durning, who as Doc Hopper embodies everything both Henson and his audience determined to resist. At every junction, Hopper comes to either offer Kermit the chance to sell out and betray his own kind. Or perhaps offer stops being the right word when Hopper's attempts to ensure Kermit's compliance become progressively more forceful and violent. The whole thing is one big metaphor for how every artist has his heart broken by the world.Of course, Animal also shows up to remind us that just because our friends are not sweet and cuddly does not make them any less of a friend. In point of fact, Animal turns out to be the best friend that Kermit has in that moment. And that has been the core message of every good show or film Henson has been involved in ever since. That shunning or dismissing others simply because of linguistic or cosmetic differences could literally be the worst mistake one ever makes. There can be little doubt that in today's world where a moron in a purple suit can tell my sons they are not good if they do not have good feelings for fifteen seasons and still not come under serious investigation by child welfare authorities, Henson's creature workshop could never have got off the ground. To misquote the album title, daring to be stupid is one thing, but enforcing the choice upon others is another matter. The Muppet Movie demonstrates how Henson dared to ask us all to think, both inside and outside of the proverbial box. There will never be another entirely like him, but he never would want us to stop trying.Therefore, The Muppet Movie is the epitome of a ten out of ten film. If we were to send a film out into the cosmos to prove to intelligent life that we are worth more than being obliterated, this would be it.

Scaring me to death as a youngster, the film succeeds completely in merging different genres together. For the first part, a gung-ho action flick - for the second part, a nerve-jangling horror that develops into a tremendous adventure film.The film feels like a real team effort, much like the heroes of the film itself. Everyone involved in the production has brought something creative, unique or memorable to the table and has made Predator become a hugely popular film and franchise.Firstly, the scipt is chock-full of classic dialogue, making this one of the most quoted films in history, with so many cheesy one-liners that you've be forgiven for thinking the characters were being hunted by a hungry mouse. However, the script and the premise is genius - by simply pitting an alien hunter against Earth's finest prey, humans (commandos even), the situations write themselves; boy-scout traps, mud-camouflaged Arnie and the villain which imitates and toys with its prey. The sequel, which is OK but not a classic, managed to develop this idea even further with a wider arsenal and deeper understanding of the alien race, which gives this film a little something to separate it from other standard Alien-ripoffs.Secondly, director John McTiernan keeps the film zooming along at a sensible pace. When there's any danger of actual character development, we move straight on to the next scene and dispense with said character lol. There's a tremendous atmosphere as the commandos enter the jungle - it's like another world and straight away the audience is thrown out of its seat with a shocking discovery up in the trees. In fact, the massive outbursts of violence in Predator are still very savage today and despite more violence now getting through censors, we don't get to see anything quite so shocking as skinned corpses and spinal cords being ripped out! Eventually, the tension is cranked up to breaking point as it's left to Arnie to stick around and avenge his team, Tarzan-style.Next, the visual effects people should be congratulated. From amazing pyrotechnics to the legendary heat vision and camouflage which is part of Predator's unique quality. Even today, the image of a blurry silhouette running through the jungle gives me the shivers and when the final battle kicks in, sparks truly fly. The cameo-effect is one of the best special effects i've ever seen and feels like the discovery of bullet time or something just as classic.Thank the lord for Stan Winston, who practically saved the film by ditching the original dopey design of the Predator and coming up with the masked humanoid with some nice dreadlocks. Most people prefer Giger's Alien design over this, but I always prefer the Predator, largely thanks to Kevin Peter Hall's performance. Instead of a guy in a suit, which Alien eventually seemed like at the end, we get a nasty looking alien under a mask. Never do we think that it's just a bloke under there. The Predator swings from to tree to tree like a monkey and bounds great distances like Frankenstein's monster on steroids. Instead of a clumsy, fake alien, we get something that really does act and look intelligent enough to hunt a team of crack commandos. The appearance itself is truly memorable and it's debatable whether the Pred looks cooler with or without his metal mask.As I said before, it's a real ensemble effort and even the actors bring something to the film that stands out. We don't need character development for this type of film, we just need something that makes each guy different so that we know who's getting wasted - a problem which many monster flicks mess up by throwing in a bunch of blands. Here, every character is radically different; Dutch, the sensible team-leader (although Arnie doesn't exactly need to be distinguished), Dillon who has shades of Apollo Creed in trying to keep his cool and save face, Mac who starts off quite laid back and eventually goes mad, Blain who utters the best one-liners and carries a bleeding mini gun around(!), Billy the tracker who is just out-there and knows something's wrong from the off, Poncho who speaks Spanish and wields a grenade launcher and Hawkins who reads comics, works the radio and tells dirty jokes.Finally, the score needs mentioning as this is one of the most atmospheric soundtracks ever and adds to the films pounding tension. As soon as we enter the jungle, the music spells doom for all with subtle tones that soon explode to life. Considering how much hiking through jungle there is (and yeah, the locations people should be noted as well because this is some truly bad-ass bush), it's surprising we don't feel it because the whole time Alan Silvestri keeps us entertained with the film's classic theme tune.Spawning a decent sequel and countless other media, it goes to show the power of Predator. It all started here, when it was just considered an alien-ripoff but has since shrugged off those roots and claimed it's own slice of history. Everyone involved in the film has contributed something - it's as though their careers have all peaked at the same time and met up on this film. The result is just quality; remarkable, memorable and exhilarating.

Everyone involved in the production has brought something creative, unique or memorable to the table and has made Predator become a hugely popular film and franchise.Firstly, the scipt is chock-full of classic dialogue, making this one of the most quoted films in history, with so many cheesy one-liners that you've be forgiven for thinking the characters were being hunted by a hungry mouse. However, the script and the premise is genius - by simply pitting an alien hunter against Earth's finest prey, humans (commandos even), the situations write themselves; boy-scout traps, mud-camouflaged Arnie and the villain which imitates and toys with its prey. The sequel, which is OK but not a classic, managed to develop this idea even further with a wider arsenal and deeper understanding of the alien race, which gives this film a little something to separate it from other standard Alien-ripoffs.Secondly, director John McTiernan keeps the film zooming along at a sensible pace. When there's any danger of actual character development, we move straight on to the next scene and dispense with said character lol. There's a tremendous atmosphere as the commandos enter the jungle - it's like another world and straight away the audience is thrown out of its seat with a shocking discovery up in the trees. In fact, the massive outbursts of violence in Predator are still very savage today and despite more violence now getting through censors, we don't get to see anything quite so shocking as skinned corpses and spinal cords being ripped out! Eventually, the tension is cranked up to breaking point as it's left to Arnie to stick around and avenge his team, Tarzan-style.Next, the visual effects people should be congratulated. From amazing pyrotechnics to the legendary heat vision and camouflage which is part of Predator's unique quality. Even today, the image of a blurry silhouette running through the jungle gives me the shivers and when the final battle kicks in, sparks truly fly. The cameo-effect is one of the best special effects i've ever seen and feels like the discovery of bullet time or something just as classic.Thank the lord for Stan Winston, who practically saved the film by ditching the original dopey design of the Predator and coming up with the masked humanoid with some nice dreadlocks. Most people prefer Giger's Alien design over this, but I always prefer the Predator, largely thanks to Kevin Peter Hall's performance. Instead of a guy in a suit, which Alien eventually seemed like at the end, we get a nasty looking alien under a mask. Never do we think that it's just a bloke under there. The Predator swings from to tree to tree like a monkey and bounds great distances like Frankenstein's monster on steroids. Instead of a clumsy, fake alien, we get something that really does act and look intelligent enough to hunt a team of crack commandos. The appearance itself is truly memorable and it's debatable whether the Pred looks cooler with or without his metal mask.As I said before, it's a real ensemble effort and even the actors bring something to the film that stands out. We don't need character development for this type of film, we just need something that makes each guy different so that we know who's getting wasted - a problem which many monster flicks mess up by throwing in a bunch of blands. Here, every character is radically different; Dutch, the sensible team-leader (although Arnie doesn't exactly need to be distinguished), Dillon who has shades of Apollo Creed in trying to keep his cool and save face, Mac who starts off quite laid back and eventually goes mad, Blain who utters the best one-liners and carries a bleeding mini gun around(!), Billy the tracker who is just out-there and knows something's wrong from the off, Poncho who speaks Spanish and wields a grenade launcher and Hawkins who reads comics, works the radio and tells dirty jokes.Finally, the score needs mentioning as this is one of the most atmospheric soundtracks ever and adds to the films pounding tension. As soon as we enter the jungle, the music spells doom for all with subtle tones that soon explode to life. Considering how much hiking through jungle there is (and yeah, the locations people should be noted as well because this is some truly bad-ass bush), it's surprising we don't feel it because the whole time Alan Silvestri keeps us entertained with the film's classic theme tune.Spawning a decent sequel and countless other media, it goes to show the power of Predator. It all started here, when it was just considered an alien-ripoff but has since shrugged off those roots and claimed it's own slice of history.

The central protagonist presents just the right balance of determination, ruthless violence, and moral ambiguity, including a softer side or undeniable richness and complexity. The heroes and villains are clearly defined; the justification for the heroes to find themselves on the 'wrong side of the law' is unarguable. The gangster film has long been a genre in which Americans could work through their worst fears of living in a nation of many ethnicities; it just makes sense that the perfect gangster film would be about African Americans - the one ethnic group that is still denied total participation in our culture.The period detail is excellent and the direction is solidly professional; so is the acting; in fact that is a major point in favor of this film, and all such films, that all the participants approach their work with as careful and as a skilled a professionalism as possible. They were clearly determined right from the start to make a good movie, and they did. Surprisingly, very few Hollywood films are made with this attitude, since it's assumed there that most audiences don't care. well this audience member certainly cares, and I both admire and respect the professional when it appears.Beyond the richness of its issues, the film is also very entertaining. Yes, it is violent; it is also humorous, romantic, dramatic, and even, at times, philosophical. Much like The Godfather (which is a bit over-long to my taste), hoodlum is a 'complete package' gangster film that will leave you with a sense of having experienced life a little deeper than if you hadn't seen it.

No other actor who ever lived could have fit into the role of Frankenstein's Monster as perfectly as Karloff did, and nobody could have played the role with such brilliance (allthough Christopher Lee was, of course, also great in the 1957 Hammer Classic The Curse Of Frankenstein). Nobody else could have given the Monster this incomparable personality of a monster that is feared by everybody, but actually only a pitiable, sad, lonely creature in desperate and hopeless search for an identity and a belonging. Colin Clive delivers a brilliant performance as the young Dr. Frankenstein, who is obsessed with the idea of creating an artificial human being. And the rest of the performances is also great. Dwight Frye is unforgettable as Dr Frankenstein's hunchbacked, sadistic and crazy lab assistant Fritz, and Mae Clarke is excellent as the doctor's worried fiancée.

Its completely off the wall, its really out there and it seems to exist in a world parallel to our own. It's also one of the most original, intelligent and funniest of films I've ever seen.Consider this; a struggling puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) works as a file clerk in an office that looks like the designers had the Munchkins from The Wizard of Oz in mind when they created it. The office is so tiny you have to crane your head sideways to walk about. Craig discovers a tiny door behind a filing cabinet. And like Alice down the rabbit hole, when he goes through it, he emerges into a fantasy land. Or to be more precise, inside the body of the actor John Malkovich. Seeing the world through his eyes. For 15 minutes at a time before being spat out next to the New Jersey Turnpike.What follows is a dizzying journey of identity crises, power trips and lots and lots of wackiness. I don't know when writer Charlie Kaufman dreamt up this joyous gem of a film, or how director Spike Jonze ever convinced A-list stars Cameron Diaz, John Cusack, Charlie Sheen (in a wonderful cameo) and most importantly Malkovich himself to play along, but you're glad they saw the genius in it. This is a truly extraordinary film!Being John Malkovich must qualify as the quirkiest comedy to hit cinema screens since Groundhog Day. In fact the more I compare them, the more alike they seem. They both flow from a central conceit and we just sit back and watch the different possibilities that are opened up. And Jonze is completely engaged with the material right from the moment Craig discovers that portal into Malkovich's head.As you watch the film, it slowly draws you into this oddball situation and somehow makes it all seem strangely plausible. Craig being a puppeteer is understandably enthused when he finds out that not only can he observe the world through John Malkovich, he can exert control over him too. And isn't that one of the greatest fantasies of our time? The opportunity to be a celebrity. Even if its only for a brief time. And bask in the privileges it presents.The one question surely on all our minds is...why John Malkovich? What makes him so special? Of all the people in the world why was he singled out for this honour? Maybe because he's not an obvious choice. John Malkovich is a fine actor, and always puts in superb performances no matter what material he's asked to work with. But he's not quite the superstar say... Tom Hanks is. Or Tom Cruise. The fact that he's a little off the radar in real life makes him ideally cast.We get to see him do simple, ordinary workings of everyday life. Such as eating toast. Taking a shower. Even checking his reflection. You wouldn't think such ordinary tasks would make for compelling viewing, but sometimes even the most ordinary gestures can be as absorbing as the greatest acting.Another thing of continual delights is the wonderful screenplay Kaufman has put at our disposal. He manages to get some extraordinary mileage out of it. Perhaps because Being John Malkovich is a comedy of ideas. And the ideas just keep getting cleverer and cleverer.I love it when Craig and Maxine (a delightfully vampish Catherine Keener), a woman he lusts for who keeps peeling him off her shoe opens up JM Inc. Where people are invited to inhabit Malkovich for $200 a pop. Or when Lotte (an astonishingly drab Cameron Diaz), Craig's wife enjoys being John Malkovich so much she develops feelings for Maxine too. Maxine is having sex with Malkovich at the time! Confused yet?!The acting is super all over. Diaz and Keener are two sides of the same coin. They both love each other, but only as Malkovich! Cusack is a brilliantly dippy drip. And Charlie Sheen puts in a fantastic self-effacing cameo as Malkovich's friend. But of course, the real star here is Malkovich himself.This surely must count as the finest performance of his career. And he's playing himself! Its a great star turn on his part, and shows off his real versatility as an actor. The poor bewildered Malkovich not only has to contend with people walking around his head without his knowledge, but has to contend with them taking over his body too. The way he captures Cusack's mannerisms is astonishing. His puppet dance is a real show stopper. But the crowning delight is the moment when he goes through that tiny door for himself, and sees what's on the other side. Its a scene of inspired lunacy, and showcases Malkovich's talents and range.Some scenes are so surreal your head is spinning with the infinite possibilities BJM keeps dreaming up. Lotte chasing Maxine through the maze of Malkovich's subconscious is so conceptually dazzling it recalls the brilliance of the extraordinarily loopy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

As such it has often been viewed by horror fans as something of a disappointment, perhaps due to the light and almost comedic tone of a lot of the film. However if taken on its own merits this is a fine horror film, and compared to most other anthology-style horror films (i.e. the U.K.'s Amicus' Tales from the Crypt or the later and inferior SK film Tales from the Darkside) it is exceptional. This film was designed to introduce the younger generation of the 70s\/80s &#150; my generation &#150; to the humorous and grotesque horror aesthetic of Bill Gaines' late and lamented E.C. comics horror stories from the 1950s &#150; which were in themselves really just the latest descendant of the cherished Grand Guignol tradition in horror, done with an ironic American twist (for instance one of E.C. comics' most famous stories featured a baseball game played at midnight on consecrated ground with human body parts as the equipment and bases). In this purpose it has succeeded admirably, and I would trace seeing this film as a child as one of the formative experiences in my young life. King and Romero were expected to produce a film that was the ultimate in new horror, but instead they produced an homage to the horror of their childhoods, and in so doing produced a film with perhaps more staying power than most of their other efforts.Of course when I return to the film it doesn't quite have the same appeal, but there's plenty here for adult senses of humor as well as some genuine horror and gross-out moments. The film has 5 episodes, which are framed by the story of a young boy who is infatuated with horror comic books but whose father is a fundamentalist who throws them in the garbage. The episodes in the film represent stories in the comics, and by extension the fantasies of the angry adolescent rebel. The first story is the weakest &#150; it deals with a dead patriarch whose corpse rises from the dead for a bit of revenge against his children and disco-loving in-law (Ed Harris). This story mirrors the ordinary King\/Romero aesthetic and contains the least humor and originality of any of the episodes.The second episode is more intriguing, but still a bit spare on actual horror. Richard (Leslie Nielsen) is a man whose jealousy reaches psychotic proportions as he buries his wife (Gaylen Ross) and her lover (Ted Danson) in the sand and watches them drown on his private television security system. The story here lacks substance and ends quite abruptly and pointlessly, but it's fun to see comic stalwarts like Danson and Nielsen flexing their horror chops, and both acquit themselves quite admirably.The third finds the film at its most whimsical &#150; Jordy Verrill (King) is a mentally challenged Maine farmer (he lives in close proximity to the Capital of King Country &#150; Castle Rock) who discovers a meteorite on his property. His fantasies of a big payoff for the discovery slowly shift to nightmares as the meteor sh** causes plants to grow with alarming speed over everything &#150; including unmentionable body parts. Some scenes here are really inspired, such as the sequence where Jordy talks to his minister father's ghost in the bathroom mirror. This part of the story successfully mixes humor with horror and even tragedy as we are struck by the pathetic plight of this man whose first and only brush with an extraordinary event ends in tragedy.The fourth story is the most involved both in terms of plot and horror elements. Henry (Hal Holbrook) is a small town English professor, consumed with murder fantasies of her excessively unctuous wife (Adrienne Barbeau) but spending most of his time hanging out with his chess buddy Dexter (Fritz Weaver). When Dexter witnesses a lab assistant's murder at the hands of a mysterious creature found in a box from a19th Century arctic expedition, he sees the opportunity for perverse escape from his dilemma with his wife Billie. The horror scenes here are the best in the film, and we never really get to see the entire monster so it remains an object of terror despite the fact that most of its victims don't deserve our sympathy.The final story is the most gruesome &#150; reportedly this film had to be moved from earlier in the film to the end because some audience members literally ran out of the theater when thousands of cockroaches begin to swarm in the tiny hermetic apartment of billionaire recluse (E.G. Marshall). This sequence is short and nasty, but it represents a certain level of gross-out horror that forms a central part in the staple of American horror, and very few films possess scenes quite as revolting as some of what we see here. Again the victim does not deserve our sympathy and that undermines the horror to some extent.All in all, the film succeeds at creating a unique experience for the audience, transporting older members into a nostalgic reverie and giving a great gift to the younger viewers &#150; it enables them to laugh in the face of the horrific. While it does lack something in character and while the plot of many of the episodes is almost painfully predictable, it delivers its shock values often enough and with enough panache and style (Romero frames many of the sequences exactly the way that comic book scenes were displayed) to make it worth cherishing.

","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"20 April 2007","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Creepshow represents the union of 2 of the 1970s American horror scene's shining stars &#150; Night of the Living Dead director George Romero and Carrie\/The Shining author Stephen King (who wrote and also appears in the film). As such it has often been viewed by horror fans as something of a disappointment, perhaps due to the light and almost comedic tone of a lot of the film. However if taken on its own merits this is a fine horror film, and compared to most other anthology-style horror films (i.e. the U.K.'s Amicus' Tales from the Crypt or the later and inferior SK film Tales from the Darkside) it is exceptional. This film was designed to introduce the younger generation of the 70s\/80s &#150; my generation &#150; to the humorous and grotesque horror aesthetic of Bill Gaines' late and lamented E.C. comics horror stories from the 1950s &#150; which were in themselves really just the latest descendant of the cherished Grand Guignol tradition in horror, done with an ironic American twist (for instance one of E.C. comics' most famous stories featured a baseball game played at midnight on consecrated ground with human body parts as the equipment and bases). In this purpose it has succeeded admirably, and I would trace seeing this film as a child as one of the formative experiences in my young life. King and Romero were expected to produce a film that was the ultimate in new horror, but instead they produced an homage to the horror of their childhoods, and in so doing produced a film with perhaps more staying power than most of their other efforts.Of course when I return to the film it doesn't quite have the same appeal, but there's plenty here for adult senses of humor as well as some genuine horror and gross-out moments. The film has 5 episodes, which are framed by the story of a young boy who is infatuated with horror comic books but whose father is a fundamentalist who throws them in the garbage. The episodes in the film represent stories in the comics, and by extension the fantasies of the angry adolescent rebel. The first story is the weakest &#150; it deals with a dead patriarch whose corpse rises from the dead for a bit of revenge against his children and disco-loving in-law (Ed Harris). This story mirrors the ordinary King\/Romero aesthetic and contains the least humor and originality of any of the episodes.The second episode is more intriguing, but still a bit spare on actual horror. Richard (Leslie Nielsen) is a man whose jealousy reaches psychotic proportions as he buries his wife (Gaylen Ross) and her lover (Ted Danson) in the sand and watches them drown on his private television security system. The story here lacks substance and ends quite abruptly and pointlessly, but it's fun to see comic stalwarts like Danson and Nielsen flexing their horror chops, and both acquit themselves quite admirably.The third finds the film at its most whimsical &#150; Jordy Verrill (King) is a mentally challenged Maine farmer (he lives in close proximity to the Capital of King Country &#150; Castle Rock) who discovers a meteorite on his property. His fantasies of a big payoff for the discovery slowly shift to nightmares as the meteor sh** causes plants to grow with alarming speed over everything &#150; including unmentionable body parts. Some scenes here are really inspired, such as the sequence where Jordy talks to his minister father's ghost in the bathroom mirror.

The only major element I would criticize would be the casting of Kathryn Grayson, whose presence in a film always means the audience will be subjected to endless pseudo-operatic warbling from the petite Miss.Kelly plays a naval serviceman named Joseph Brady, a man with a mythic reputation around the ship as a lover but whose Valentino-charms are constantly being subdued by the presence of his less cocksure friend with the improbable middle-American name of Clarence (Sinatra). Upon receiving 3 days of shore leave for saving Clarence's life, Joe reluctantly agrees to help Clarence find a girl based on the dubious premise that he owes him something for saving his life. They are drafted by a policeman (Rags Ragland), who needs them to help coax a precocious young boy (Dean Stockwell) who wants to join the Navy into returning home to Aunt Susan (Grayson). At first it is Clarence who is interested in wooing Aunt Susan but eventually Kelly's character emerges as the more likely candidate.There are several standout musical scenes but nothing to come close to Kelly's more famous work in films like Singin' in the Rain and American in Paris. The closest we get is a gimmicky sequence with Kelly's character in a fantasy sequence dancing with Jerry, the mouse from Tom and Jerry (although he seems to be closer in size to a dog or cat here than to a mouse). It's a startling sequence for its time but doesn't have enough complexity or emotion to really stand the test of time. I actually enjoyed the parts of the sequence that took place prior to the animation, where Kelly was using semi-balletic moves to emphasize the transition into the fantasy world and where we see him dance down a tunnel that looks like something right out of Alice in Wonderland.Eventually the characters find their way to Susan's favorite bar, a somewhat sanitized Mexican restaurant\/bar in Tijuana. There the patrons happily allow Ms. Grayson to chirp her arias with abandon, and the management becomes very excited at the opportunity that Clarence and Joe have extended for her to sing with their friend Jose Iturbi (playing himself with a light humorous touch). Of course they've never met their friend Iturbi and they spend much of the film's length trying to reach him (in an amusing scene Sinatra's character meets Iturbi but mistakes him for a piano tuner and urges him to abandon tuning pianos and try a professional career), sneaking into the studio and the Hollywood Bowl, where Iturbi is rehearsing a surreal symphony comprised of dozens of young piano players &#150; you haven't seen anything like this outside of 1000 Fingers of Dr. T.

Everyone is 100% sure that as soon as Mr. Iturbi so much as hears Ms. Grayson, her operatic career will be a reality. The 3 primary characters are desperate to reach him and they think of him as some kind of remote and distant mythological figure &#150; a lot of the film's charm and humor comes from the contrast of this perception to the very down-to-earth real mannerisms of the maestro. And speaking of Iturbi's contributions to the film, he also provides a very stimulating musical moment with his orchestral interpretation of Donkey Serenade.When all is said and done, this is a film that nobody who enjoys musicals will want to miss. The majority of the music was written for this film, a nice contrast to recycled soundtracks for other Kelly opuses like Rain and American. Kelly is still at his early peak, adventurous and boisterous in both his dances and his interpretation of the character.

William Holden is Alverez Kelly, a citizen of Mexico of Irish ancestry, and a gentleman cattle herd leader. He has, we learn, had involvement with the U.S. before 1861 - 64. His father, the owner of a large estate in Mexico, was killed in the Mexican War (Holden says it has a different name in Mexico) by American troops, some of whom are now Confederates. But he is totally uninterested in the results of the war he is a foreign citizen intent to sell cattle to the best payer. This means, however, that he has to deal with the Union more than the South (at one point he is asked if he doubts the value of Confederate currency, and starts telling the Confederate Secretary of War what one could do now with Confederate currency). It is Holden's fortune that he gets a Union Army contract for 4500 steers that it takes him three months to bring up from Mexico. Unfortunately he is met by Major Steadmen (Patrick O'Neill) at the point where Holden felt he was supposed to deliver. Steadman is one of the most obnoxious men one can mingle with. A citizen of Boston, he was a lawyer before the war. He prides himself on being able to manipulate people by his brains (an example I will give in a moment). He drew up the contract, and in very fine print (he does apologize for it's tiny size), he had a clause added that the commanding General in the area that needs the meat can insist it be delivered there before payment. That is General Grant the cattle have to be brought to Richmond.Holden has no choice, but he will be paid. Unfortunately this leads to a 1,400 mile railway trip from Texas through the Midwest to Maryland and into Virginia - accompanied by Steadman. Earlier we saw Steadman as a stiff type - he had to wait an additional ten days for Kelly to appear at the point Kelly thought was delivery point, and does not like being kept waiting (even though the army would have been footing his bill in the border town). But on the ride he tells Kelly his war stories about being a lawyer in Massachusetts. The one we hear the great tail end of is about how he trumped a judge on a legal point in a case by use of a writ of certiorari (this legal document demands to know from the judge what is the statutory power the judge is using that is the grounds for his decision). I'm sure that most people would love to hear this type of story....I'd love to know who the Masssachusetts Judge was. Hopefully, for Steadman's career sake, it was not Lemuel Shaw, the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth, a man of formidable mind and presence. He looks it from his photos. He was also the father-in-law of a one time sailor and writer, later a customs house man named Herman Melville. Shaw, had he been embarrassed by some idiotic glory seeking lawyer would have swallowed and remembered the idiot. And the idiot would have paid in the long-run throughout Massachusetts' court system.The cattle are delivered at a plantation now in Union hands outside Richmond. But after Kelly is paid, he becomes a target of southerners led by Colonel Tom Rossiter (Richard Widmark). Rossiter sees all that wonderful meat nearby and wants it for the folks in Richmond and for Lee's forces. So he kidnaps Kelly (with the help of the plantation owner Charity Warwick (Victoria Shaw)), and Kelly soon is in Richmond being offered a chance to do the Confederacy a small aid by stealing the herd back.

William Holden is Alverez Kelly, a citizen of Mexico of Irish ancestry, and a gentleman cattle herd leader. He has, we learn, had involvement with the U.S. before 1861 - 64. His father, the owner of a large estate in Mexico, was killed in the Mexican War (Holden says it has a different name in Mexico) by American troops, some of whom are now Confederates. But he is totally uninterested in the results of the war he is a foreign citizen intent to sell cattle to the best payer. This means, however, that he has to deal with the Union more than the South (at one point he is asked if he doubts the value of Confederate currency, and starts telling the Confederate Secretary of War what one could do now with Confederate currency). It is Holden's fortune that he gets a Union Army contract for 4500 steers that it takes him three months to bring up from Mexico. Unfortunately he is met by Major Steadmen (Patrick O'Neill) at the point where Holden felt he was supposed to deliver. Steadman is one of the most obnoxious men one can mingle with. A citizen of Boston, he was a lawyer before the war. He prides himself on being able to manipulate people by his brains (an example I will give in a moment). He drew up the contract, and in very fine print (he does apologize for it's tiny size), he had a clause added that the commanding General in the area that needs the meat can insist it be delivered there before payment. That is General Grant the cattle have to be brought to Richmond.Holden has no choice, but he will be paid. Unfortunately this leads to a 1,400 mile railway trip from Texas through the Midwest to Maryland and into Virginia - accompanied by Steadman. Earlier we saw Steadman as a stiff type - he had to wait an additional ten days for Kelly to appear at the point Kelly thought was delivery point, and does not like being kept waiting (even though the army would have been footing his bill in the border town). But on the ride he tells Kelly his war stories about being a lawyer in Massachusetts. The one we hear the great tail end of is about how he trumped a judge on a legal point in a case by use of a writ of certiorari (this legal document demands to know from the judge what is the statutory power the judge is using that is the grounds for his decision). I'm sure that most people would love to hear this type of story....I'd love to know who the Masssachusetts Judge was. Hopefully, for Steadman's career sake, it was not Lemuel Shaw, the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth, a man of formidable mind and presence. He looks it from his photos. He was also the father-in-law of a one time sailor and writer, later a customs house man named Herman Melville. Shaw, had he been embarrassed by some idiotic glory seeking lawyer would have swallowed and remembered the idiot. And the idiot would have paid in the long-run throughout Massachusetts' court system.The cattle are delivered at a plantation now in Union hands outside Richmond. But after Kelly is paid, he becomes a target of southerners led by Colonel Tom Rossiter (Richard Widmark). Rossiter sees all that wonderful meat nearby and wants it for the folks in Richmond and for Lee's forces. So he kidnaps Kelly (with the help of the plantation owner Charity Warwick (Victoria Shaw)), and Kelly soon is in Richmond being offered a chance to do the Confederacy a small aid by stealing the herd back.

Eager to see a film version of the Hawthorne book I was, Very Disappointed. It is sad that some people will think that this is the real Scarlet Letter. The names of characters are the same as the book but it rapidly departs from the book beyond that -- and for the worse.You will read commentaries here about what a wonderful film this was with discussions of the beautiful cinematography and great acting. They will also say how it is loosely adapted from Hawthornes' book. These are all true statements and the loose in loosely should be especially emphasized. I even agree that normally an adaption might be judged on its own merits. So why did I give this a low score? Because it is titled The Scarlet Letter. That is a classical book with some very deep moral messages. The very term Scarlet Letter has taken on a special meaning in our language and culture. But, if someone recognizes what Hawthorne was trying to do with his book, they will immediately see this as a rotten-to-the-core script. Consider the Scarlet Letter, a central theme in the book and holding so much meaning, is just a minor prop in this movie that almost gets in the way.In Hawthorne's book, the heroine, by her actions through life, turned the Scarlet Letter from meaning Adulteress to meaning Angel -- it became an emblem of her inner beauty, redeemed through her strength, integrity and good heart. In our own time, people often find themselves labeled or identified in some way as bad or as a loser. What a great thing it is to have messages that say You can rise above that!. This movie completely and totally misses that opportunity. It is one of the great messages that can be given to others in this life, and it is abandoned in this movie.And what is it traded for? Feminism, rebellion and justifications of immorality. Edgy? Groundbreaking? Incisive? No. So shallow its like cliff diving in a birdbath compared with what Hawthorne brought. In this adaptation, Hester, the heroine claims to not know if what she did was wrong -- or sometimes suggesting it was right. From that high moral ground, Hester almost becomes a feminist warrior or icon leading an insurrection of women against men. That rebellion is ridiculous historically but worse, it completely guts the morality of the book. And the Scarlet Letter? From what I can tell, the movie Hester seems to finally throw it away when she gets her freedom. It has no meaning other than as a talisman for oppression.That is a different message than the book gave out. But the Movie is still called The Scarlet Letter. If the screenwriter wanted to send out a different moral message, then he should have retitled the movie. Something like Hester's Anachronistic and Pointless Rebellion would have been good. Then it would be truth in advertising.The actors and technicians did a great job but after reading the script they should have dropped the project. I suppose they needed the money. Beautifully shot, well acted, great score ... it still gets a 1 for being an egregious lie.
