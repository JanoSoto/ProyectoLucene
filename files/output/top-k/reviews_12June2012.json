The constant, ridiculous disputes and fights between Americans and 'Ruskis' (as they are called in the movie) contributed to the fact that this movie actually took shape of a most pleasurable caricature of a war film ever.I can only imagine how Stanley Kubrick suddenly realized that the script that he's been working on didn't really present this tremendously serious topic in a totally respectable manner, but absolutely on the contrary &#x96; as a genuine parody.It's scary to laugh at such a tragic moment in the history of our world, but the way that Kubrick depicted all the imaginary (thankfully) events that lead on to a prospect of nuclear holocaust is so humorous that no one will be able to suppress laughter. I don't think that any other director will ever be able to do it in such a way that he has. It's hard to imagine the disturbing power of the message that the movie gave to the viewers in the times of its premiere. However, in fact, it may be right to say that people, scared of the concept of another war hanging over their heads, were walking out of the cinemas feeling much more relaxed, after seeing a film so brilliant and bizarre at the same time.There are so many fantastic moments in the film that it would be hard to point out all of them, so I'll just mention some of my favorite Gen. Turgidson starts a fight with the Russian ambassador and president Muffley says 'Gentlemen, you can't fight in here, this is the war room!'; Capt. Mandrake trying to call Mr. President, when he doesn't have enough change to put in the phone machine, and asks for a collect call; the shooting of a Coke machine to get some pennies; the ridiculous phone call that Turgidson receives from his mistress during the serious talks in the War Room; Muffley's conversation on the phone with the Russian President; the scene of a soldier bull-riding a nuclear missile shouting 'woo-hoo'; every scene that includes Dr. Strangelove and his disobedient Nazi hand.It's so full of totally humorous and absurd situations, ideas, sequences, notions, connotations, characters that it's simply overwhelming, in the most positive meaning of the word.It's also packed with many splendid performances by a bunch of brilliant actors. Sterling Hayden as the paranoid Gen. Jack Ripper gives an exquisite show, being the one who actually started the whole nuclear mess. Later he tries to persuade his comrades that there is a possibility of a Russian fluoridation scheme to poison the US citizens. George C. Scott as Turgidson, laid back ladies' man and general full of hatred towards 'Ruskis'. But the biggest credit goes to the magnificent Peter Sellers, for his versatile and confident acting as three distinct characters. He is so convincing that it looks as though different actors played all of those parts. It's a shame that the Academy jury didn't award him with an Oscar, because the way that he portrays those three major persons is a standout achievement of his long career.Come to think of it, if all the ideas that's been put out in Dr. Strangelove the world as we now know it probably would not exist. I mean, with all the talks about fluoridation, poisoning, and weapons of mass destruction that would destroy all life on Earth if somebody attacked the Soviet Union, it's hard to stay indifferent to the topic of nuclear disasters. However, as I mentioned it previously, the way that Kubrick was able to present all of the gimmicks is so laughable that it makes all of those notions unbelievable and nonsensical. All of those factors combined make Dr. Strangelove a stop on the filmography road that no one should omit.

The film came out in 1995 and since then grossed over $ 168 million, it won the ASCAP award for Top Box Office Films in 1997. The film is set in the 1990's and in the year 2035, and was shot mostly in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Its cast consists of top class actors such as Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. Twelve Monkeys was nominated for two Oscars the year after it came out Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Brad Pitt) and Best Costumes Design (Julie Weiss). Brad Pitt won a Golden Globe in 1996 for his performance.The film is about James Cole, a convicted criminal that lives in the year 2035. He is part of the 1% of the worldwide population that survived the spreading of a lethal virus in 1996, now living underground. Scientists think that the virus was released by a terrorist group called the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, and with a newly invented of time machine they send James back in time to collect information about the virus. When James time travels for the first time he gets send to the wrong point in time, where he meets Dr Railly, who will later on aid him on his search. He also meets Jeffrey Goines, who he later finds out to be the leader of the Twelve Monkeys. Since the time travelling was so confusing for James he was declared insane by the people of the 90's, and he even gets put away in an insane asylum. Luckily for him he gets send back to the future and eventually even gets another attempt to change the course of history. But you will have to watch the film yourself if you want to find out whether he succeeds in his task or not.Twelve Monkey's grim post-apocalyptic setting makes up for a good science-fiction story and is quite original. David and Janet Peoples based this story on the famous French silent film 'La jetée'. Some people might consider the story to be weak because of its difficulty, but once the viewer truly enables him- or herself to understand all the plot twists and flashbacks they are given an excellent story. The writers did an outstanding job by introducing all sorts of interesting characters in the story such as Jeffrey Goines. His dialogue is perfect for an animal-activist and anti-consumerist who finds himself in a mental institution like the one he is in. Another aspect which is beautifully represented in Twelve Monkeys is the use of flashbacks which seem carefully planned to build tension and keep viewers interested, in this aspect it succeeds. Because of these perfect planned flashbacks you'll find yourself thinking about the amazing twists and revelations that are to come. If there was one criticism that could be made of the story, time-span is the one to be brought forward. Given that the film is set in 1996 and 1990 respectively and that the film was released during the last month of 1995 you have the feeling a lot of your anxiety is gone because the possibility of all the things happening in the plot happening in real life seem close to impossible. This however should not be seen as important because the story in its own right is excellent and drags you in. Given this Twelve Monkeys has probably one the best stories you'll see in a science-fiction film in a long time.Other things that played key roles in the making of this film were the sound and lighting in it. Each and every time the timing of the sounds or rather the music is nearly perfect, giving you this extra feeling of craziness, madness, sometimes making it even hilarious. This also drags you into the illusion-like world you are watching. You will start to get confused like the characters, even though the narrative mode is from an omniscient perspective. The lighting, like the use of music, adds up to the mood of the scenes throughout the movie. Also the fact that the film is old makes it more believable. If this film was made in the 21st century, with all the technology we have now, it would be very weird and difficult to attract the viewers into the illusion-like world of the film. However it is incredible that these techniques, the use of sound and lighting, were already so well applied to films in the last century.In conclusion we think that this film was put together quite well, they especially nailed the chaotic and insane theme. This is off course to be expected from a director such as Terry Gilliam, since you can easily call bizarre fantasy films his field of expertise. The chaotic styling, the acting and off course the music all play a huge role in what makes this film so out of the ordinary, they really contribute to the story, making everything much more of a realistic experience. Most time travel based films are not flawless however, but apart from a couple of minor points we think that the director and writer did a great job at it in this film. If you are into stories set in a post-apocalyptic world, or you really like films with a crazy and schizophrenic feel to it, we strongly advise you to go and watch this terrific classic of a film. And if you then are able look past the old representation of the future, we can assure you that you are in for 2 hours of pure pleasure.

Halloween, the one and only, in which John Carpenter had directed, was and is the ultimate in slasher\/horror storytelling. I myself am a big fan of John Carpenter's films e.g. The Fog, Escape from New York, The Thing and the list goes on. This director doesn't make movies to add pointless and unnecessary scenes that can drag on and confuse most moviegoers. He goes straight to the point and meaning by the written script. Halloween is probably the only slasher flick that surpasses all other imitators and sequels due to being the original idea. The movie has the perfect setting to make a classic slasher. The autumnal leaves, the blue hues used in the night shots that set the creepiness and murky darkness and overshadowing Michael Myers. He especially is one evil, foreboding force of nature. For one moment appears behind his unsuspecting victims and next minute when the camera moves towards a different position then back again to where he was standing, he disappears. He also blends in with the pitch blackness and reveals only his pale bluish-white mask, just like a phantom. Orange jack-o-lanterns grinning and glowing, especially one serving as the fulcrum when the camera move in towards its left eye and until then the camera closes in and the light dims and goes out in the opening credits. That's a great way of delivering the message of the consequences we choose that often attend our usual manner of perception. What makes the movie another big highlight is leaving aside the minimal gore and graphic violence. I don't mind it, but while many low-budget horror\/slasher films thought gore was essential to startle audiences, Halloween had the guts to play out as the jack-in-the-box, where the killer lunges into our field of vision or moving slowly towards the victims' backs to trick or scare its viewers. Also, the first person camera viewing which represents the killer's point-of-view and heavy breathing is intensely creepy and claustrophobic. I wonder what his intentions are when walking around in such shadowy and murky areas. Who is his next victim? And, of course you can't forget the moody music that John Carpenter had composed for the introduction and then used to represent the killer's presence. It literally delves us into a dark corner.The fear meters aren't as high as they used to be when Halloween and horror films before and mostly 80's horror films arrived. Although gore was introduced around the 80's, they still used the method of having something burst into our image. And because gore has been introduced, the jack-in-the-box technique has degraded. Gore and graphic violence has now stepped onto the line of horror films and is commonly used as a new way of shocking audiences by thrusting them into becoming squeamish and not coming to see it again. It's nothing new and is a bummer. It's not original and it's mainly carbon copies of one's previously used idea to eventually reach profitable box office results.Jamie Lee Curtis is great as playing the helpless victim and finally to becoming a sole survivor, especially her screams are classic and high- pitched. Donald Pleasance as Michael's doctor was given the perfect script to behave scared witless and desperate when on the hunt for his patient (the killer). His narration on Michael's psyche is also suspiciously quoted. It eludes us into a very, very dark world where the secret lies at the heart of one's inside.

The autumnal leaves, the blue hues used in the night shots that set the creepiness and murky darkness and overshadowing Michael Myers. He especially is one evil, foreboding force of nature. For one moment appears behind his unsuspecting victims and next minute when the camera moves towards a different position then back again to where he was standing, he disappears. He also blends in with the pitch blackness and reveals only his pale bluish-white mask, just like a phantom. Orange jack-o-lanterns grinning and glowing, especially one serving as the fulcrum when the camera move in towards its left eye and until then the camera closes in and the light dims and goes out in the opening credits. That's a great way of delivering the message of the consequences we choose that often attend our usual manner of perception. What makes the movie another big highlight is leaving aside the minimal gore and graphic violence. I don't mind it, but while many low-budget horror\/slasher films thought gore was essential to startle audiences, Halloween had the guts to play out as the jack-in-the-box, where the killer lunges into our field of vision or moving slowly towards the victims' backs to trick or scare its viewers. Also, the first person camera viewing which represents the killer's point-of-view and heavy breathing is intensely creepy and claustrophobic. I wonder what his intentions are when walking around in such shadowy and murky areas. Who is his next victim? And, of course you can't forget the moody music that John Carpenter had composed for the introduction and then used to represent the killer's presence. It literally delves us into a dark corner.The fear meters aren't as high as they used to be when Halloween and horror films before and mostly 80's horror films arrived. Although gore was introduced around the 80's, they still used the method of having something burst into our image. And because gore has been introduced, the jack-in-the-box technique has degraded. Gore and graphic violence has now stepped onto the line of horror films and is commonly used as a new way of shocking audiences by thrusting them into becoming squeamish and not coming to see it again. It's nothing new and is a bummer. It's not original and it's mainly carbon copies of one's previously used idea to eventually reach profitable box office results.Jamie Lee Curtis is great as playing the helpless victim and finally to becoming a sole survivor, especially her screams are classic and high- pitched. Donald Pleasance as Michael's doctor was given the perfect script to behave scared witless and desperate when on the hunt for his patient (the killer). His narration on Michael's psyche is also suspiciously quoted. It eludes us into a very, very dark world where the secret lies at the heart of one's inside. Welcome to the world where true terror lies. 9.5\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"12 June 2012","score":"","review":" I hope that the new remake (not yet released) is better than the original.

But as the story unfolds, involving more and more characters, the two protagonists will dramatically lose control over their games.The roles are played to perfection by each actor in the cast, Close and Malkovich stand beyond reproach, Reeves and Thurman make excellent appearances in two of their earlier roles, but Michelle Pfeiffer is the one who moves us most, as we witness her desperately fighting against her feelings in order to keep her integrity. Praises should not be directed solely to the cast sets, lighting, costumes, music&#x85; everything immerses us into the atmosphere of that time, and makes us feel as if we're really part of the story. The quality of the production shows how an all-American team used his appreciation of French culture to succeed in its adaptation. I have watched this movie about 15 times and still didn't find any flaw. In my opinion, it deserves 10 out of 10.Another thing to note is the French audio track. I usually watch American movies in their original language, but in this Blu-Ray, both languages are remarkably done. The ancient French phrasing plunges us even more in the ambiance of this time.But if there's only one reason one should purchase this Blu-Ray (released in February 2012), it's the story. The progress of events fascinates us, fastens us to our chair, and makes us beg for more, until it leads us to one of the most unforgettable climax in movie history. An ending that keep us thinking about the tormented relationships between love and pride, between love and the ones who play with it.

The Rockaway family dealing with everyday issues in a series of vignettes, and the fictional life of Sally White (Mia Farrow) as she rises from cigarette girl to glittering radio star.The cast is excellent. Farrow has a solid role as the Brooklyn girl with the Judy Holliday voice who battles her way toward upward mobility. Julie Kavner and Michael Tucker are terrific as the parents. Dianne Wiest is sweet as Aunt Bea, always on the lookout for true love. Seth Green plays Woody as a kid. Diane Keaton and Kitty Carlisle show up as singers. Josh Mostel and Renee Lippin are hilarious as the aunt and uncle. Wallace Shawn has a funny bit as the Masked Avenger. Other notables include Richard Portnow as Si, Kenneth Mars as the rabbi, Larry David as the crazed neighbor, Jeff Daniels and William H. Macy as radio actors, Tony Roberts as the game show host, Danny Aiello as the gangster, and a special kudo for the hilarious Gina DeAngelis as his mother.Highlights include Bea's date on the night of Orson Welles' famous radio program about a Martian invasion, and the poignant episode about the live radio coverage of a girl who's fallen down a well. The film also takes nostalgic looks at radio serials, quiz programs, and comedy shows.The film perfectly captures the middle class neighborhood of Allen's youth. The interiors are beautifully done (Santo Loquasto), and very memorable is the awe-inspiring visit to Radio City Music Hall with its dimmed lights, lush carpets, and warm red-and-gold tones.There is also a parade oh hit songs of the day that include September Song, Tico Tico, Mairzy Doats, South American Way, Pistol Packin' Mama, If I Didn't Care, and so many others.A final word for the many actors and actresses in small parts who make this movie feel so right.

Much has been said about Al's mental state and with good reason. Sat silently and stone faced travelling aimlessly, his presence gave the opening scenes a mysterious quality which only enhanced once the camera quickly moved in on Al's face. The lights darkens to the extent where his bold eyes are the focus points, drawing us into his mind where a tale of greed and ambition unravels.We quickly learn of Al's complexity from his back story via his internal monologues. When his long time girlfriend and performance partner Sue decides to crack Hollywood, Al follows suit. Throughout his hitchhiking travels he continues his internal monologue talking about the dangers of money, how it destroys and causes greed. In retrospect this is a foreboding for what follows. Although Al denounces greed it seems that he ends up succumbing to this vice. The plot spirals into dangerous territory after the death of a stranger Al meets hitchhiking. Was it truly an accident or was it murder? What ever the cause of death it must have taken place during the fantasy sequence of Sue singing I can't believe you're in love with me. Considering the noir nature of Detour it is not surprising if Al killed for the woman he loved.Therefore we begin to analysis the actions of Al. Since Detour is from Al's perspective, we only see what Al sees. It becomes a distorting experience to the point where we feel the same disposition. Things go from bad to worse when Al, now using a false identity meets Vera. Knowing Al's true identity instead of giving up to the police Vera decides to use Al for money. This is where Detour reaches its peak in its noir nature, the contrasting chemistry between Al and Vera as they sarcastically abuse each other at their own pleasure. Vera is the typical femme fa tale, a woman willing to do anything for her own gain acting in a determined, callous manner. Using her scheming ways to the extent where she wants Al to continue faking his identity in order to collect an inheritance.Soon there is a tense standoff between the pair when Vera out of spite attempts to call the police on Al. The close ups between Vera and Al with along with the tense silence builds up to a fatal end. Another questionable death takes place after Al breaks in Vera's room to find her dead, the chord wrapped around her neck after collapsing on her bed in a drunken state. From the shared POV shot the cinematography creates a blurred effect which again raises questions to Al's sanity.By Detour's end the question of Al's sanity is solved as he is apprehended by the police, most likely to appease the Hay's code which unfortunately takes away Detour's ambiguity. Yet the ending sums up a tragic story in typical noir fashion. All Al wanted to do was to be with his girlfriend but somehow descended into a state where seduced by greed and desire drove him to murder.

They ask him if it will be enough and Chris replies I have been offered a lot for my work - but never everything.The second quote is delivered by one of films most ubiquitous bit part actors - Whit Bissel. He, as usual, hits a home run with ease. Two good Samaritan easterners have paid Whit as the local undertaker enough to bury a man who has fallen dead in front of them on the sidewalk. Whit informs them that it is not going to be possible because the locals object to having an Indian buried in Boot Hill to the point that they might shoot anyone who dares try. Even Whit's driver has quit. He's prejudiced too, huh? asks one of the easterners. Well, when it comes to a chance of getting his head blown off, he's downright bigoted replies Whit with a matter-of-factness that wrings out every ounce of wry humour possible. There are plenty more quotes that jump out of the film and into your memory. Steve McQueen gets some ironic gems and Bronson's eccentric millionaire crack as he chops wood in return for his breakfast is another good one. It is to be remembered that it is the actors who makes the lines really pay in The Magnificent Seven. The voices and timing of Whit Bissel, Yul Bryner, Steve McQueen and the rest of the crew can never be underestimated. The screen writers William Roberts, Walter Bernstein and Walter Newman must also take great credit for coming up with such a lively and entertaining script.

This movie is one of them. There are multiple reasons to why this movie should have been a success and yet audiences never realized the material within. It may not be Captain America The First Avenger (2011) or Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) but the adventure is just as filling.The Rocketeer recollects the time when everything entailed G-men in pressed suits, kingpins wearing corsages, sinister masterminds cleverly disguised as other individuals, and damsels' in distress. It is a much- welcomed nostalgic aura because these types of elements aren't always used in the correct manner. But director Joe Johnston, utilizes everything that's given to him and it's done brilliantly. And although it wasn't made the exact way he wanted it to be, Dave Stevens, the creator of The Rocketeer character, which was derived from a popular comic book, was happily satisfied with the majority of the movie.In this film, because Disney sponsored it, the story not only will appeal to adults but to teenagers as well. The original comic book was actually more for adults. Bill Campbell as Cliff Secord was an excellent choice, as was Jennifer Connelly as his attractive love interest. And like many other films, Connelly plays her strong-willed female character quite proficiently. Both look stunning together as well kudos to the casting by Nancy Foy. Thankfully, the writers decided to have Secord already have a love interest and not find her as the plot continued, like most love stories go. Also the fact that this film doesn't have sappy love. This can drain the energy from the whole plot, making it difficult for the audience.As characters go, many scenes were done in pairs. If it's not Secord's technician pal, Peevy (Alan Arkin), making funny lines, it's mobster Eddie Valentine (Paul Sorvino) making threats to his boss, Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton). And if it's not them, the audience will even take pleasure in watching Ed Lauter and James Handy, play two FBI agents, Fitch and Wooly, who seem to always be one step behind everyone else. And who's their boss? Nobody else but Howard Hughes, played by Terry O'Quinn. The screenplay leaves nobody out of the story and that's good because every character is amiable for their own reasons. Each role was given special care so that no one would be left out off the screen and it shows. The special effects are reputable here too. Some audiences may find them exhausted due to how special effects are used nowadays but all the same, for 1991, that's exceptionally impressive. Not to mention that 1991 was the beginning of when CGI was first introduced from Cameron's Terminator 2 Judgement Day (1991). But when Secord is up in air and soaring like a fighter jet, it's still an eye-catcher today. Some may even call Secord as the Ironman (2008) of his time and in a way, they're right! And although The Rocketeer wasn't a machine, he was the first human flying machine. It's a lot of fun to watch.There is no question about action in this adventure tale either. All of it is appropriate for its audience especially for what Johnston was given to work with story wise. I will admit that there wasn't as much as I had expected there to be but I still loved the movie at the end. The music is great too. The man who created a stirring soundtrack to the movie Glory (1989), is back again; James Horner. Horner may not have made this particular soundtrack to be emotionally moving, but it is profusely joyful and innocent, making it just as delightful. And just like Glory's tune, The Rocketeer has its own theme that's also of one to remember.

But when Secord is up in air and soaring like a fighter jet, it's still an eye-catcher today. Some may even call Secord as the Ironman (2008) of his time and in a way, they're right! And although The Rocketeer wasn't a machine, he was the first human flying machine. It's a lot of fun to watch.There is no question about action in this adventure tale either. All of it is appropriate for its audience especially for what Johnston was given to work with story wise. I will admit that there wasn't as much as I had expected there to be but I still loved the movie at the end. The music is great too. The man who created a stirring soundtrack to the movie Glory (1989), is back again; James Horner. Horner may not have made this particular soundtrack to be emotionally moving, but it is profusely joyful and innocent, making it just as delightful. And just like Glory's tune, The Rocketeer has its own theme that's also of one to remember. The conversion of Dave Stevens' comic book hero has a great cast, a pleasant screenplay, and a sensational soundtrack. It's shocking that a film done this well, did not make it big in the movie business.

I may only assume that The Magnificent Ambersons would make a much bigger impression on the viewers, as of now it's probably one of the most underrated of all Orson Welles' movies. But still, the RKO Radio version is a remarkable one, and everyone should definitely see it.It's worth mentioning that this picture wouldn't be so fine without the great narration, provided by the director himself, which places the movie in time and space, and give a great insight into the characters' personalities.The Magnificence of the Ambersons lies in their ability to make money. This very prominent family was connected with success and wealth for generations. However, the movie doesn't intend to bask in their glory. Instead, it shows a gradual downfall of this clan, in the revolutionary times of great expansion and progress during the 19th century. The plot cleverly intertwines this sad tale of a decaying family, so to say, with a story about love that wasn't meant to be.Eugene Morgan (Joseph Cotten), a handsome man from middle class, has always been fond of Isabel Amerson (Dolores Costello). He wanted to marry her, but she chose a dull and tedious Wilbur Minafer instead. They had a boy named George (Tim Holt), who was ever so rude, impolite and obnoxious towards other citizen. All the people wanted to see was for the boy to finally get a well-deserved punishment, but his family background was like a shield that protected him from every bad thing.Years later, Eugene comes back to town as a widowed, very successful endorser and maker of a possible life-changing invention the automobile. His daughter Lucy also arrives in town and George, who's grown to be an enormously snobbish, arrogant, and intolerable young heir, is charmed by her prettiness. After the death of Wilbur, Eugene steps in to make Isabel fall in love with him again and that doesn't suit George in any way. Being so full of hatred and jealousy he, along with the help of a devious and eccentric aunt Fanny (Agnes Moorehead), plans to sabotage their relationship.I think it's brilliant that Orson Welles was able to present a tragic story about love, and at the same time show how, in the times of industrial revolution, one rich family lost their big chance to stay on top and eventually collapsed under the weight of industrialization. George finally got what he deserved, being the grand maker of the fall of his own household. Overcome with bursting wrath and anger, he didn't understand that his actions struck the ones that he tended to love the most. In the final scenes, he wanders around town confused, looking at the changes that the revolution brought, and realizing that everybody went forward but him, as he was too concentrated on his selfish desires.Great performances from all the actors Joseph Cotton as the stylish and dignified man, who was true to his first love up till the final moments; Dolores Costello shines in all her beauty and elegance; Tim Holt as the spoiled brat George, who not only made his mother miserable and sad, but also missed a chance to rebuild his family's magnificence; Agnes Moorehead gave probably the most memorable performance of all, as the wacky aunt Fanny, so in love with perfidious affair of any sort that it ultimately made her descend into psychosis.All in all, The Magnificent Ambersons is a vital position in the Orson Welles directorial career. It's highly recommended, mainly for its brilliant story, fine historical allusions, beautiful sceneries, and fantastic performances.

Carter's interactions with the locals and clashes with the more calm Chinese culture compared to his audacious, egocentric personality are really the highlights yet again. As I said, a hardcore African American making his way in Hong Kong is bound to be a laugh. Yet another stellar script and consistent directing from Brett Ratner help to ensure this sequel doesn't bomb out. A little less realistic, but then again, if you are familiar with 'Rush Hour', realism isn't the first thing on the agenda as much as action work and comedy play. The script was a little less compelling this time and seemed to be driven with a lighter direction in mind although it was interesting to learn a little more of the backgrounds of our two leads. Chris Tucker's loudmouth antics just about match up to his brilliant show in the original, his dialogue is as fresh, smooth, fast and excessive as ever. Oh, and did I mention as funny? He dominates the screen once again, takes charge and gives you his typical impulsive on-screen persona. Jackie Chan reaffirms his reputation as one of the world's best film stuntmen. His stunts yet again were terrifically executed and he was well supported by 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' star, Zhang Ziyi. The 'bamboo scene' was comparable in awe-worthiness to the 'convention center' finale scene in 'Rush Hour'. Again as the more sensible and sedate Inspector Lee, his partnership with Tucker is as good as ever and the interplay once again is just plain, good fun. We also saw a shift in the love interest angle with the introduction of the seductive, sexy secret service agent, Isabella Molina played by Roselyn Sanchez. Her allegiances mysterious, she really sizzles in her role. Now that the duo finally have a beautiful woman to fight over, any guesses as to who wins? If I don't give this 5 stars, it's simply because in some respects, it's a rehash of the original, in the same way in which you would deem Lethal Weapon 1 better than Lethal Weapon 2 or Beverly Hills Cop 1 superior to its successor. If you did however enjoy the original formula, look into this. As I said, it is the same old thing in some ways, but in others, the Tucker-Chan combination still find ways to surprise and entertain.

The film, itself, is a remarkable piece, but the dialog in it is harsh, degrading, yet such a common standard today that it sadly seems like the norm. Filmed and released in 1995, it was certainly ahead of its time, and it's safe to say that things haven't gotten any better for society.Consistent readers will know that I love films with sharp, inviting social commentary on our world. I recently awarded three and a half stars to Bobcat Goldthwait's remarkably sharp film God Bless America, about a man and a young girl taking a loaded gun to things they have a disdain for in the world, such as empty-headed celebrities and hate-spreading political commentators. I awarded the same amount of stars to Falling Down, with Michael Douglas, another brilliantly crafted exercise providing a stern lecture on the arrogance of our world. And now, here is Kids, which comes straight out of left field for me. It is a poignantly made picture chronicling the lives of societal degenerates as they hopelessly wander the streets of New York City, unaccompanied and unprotected from the grittiness that lies ahead.Our protagonist is sixteen year old Telly (Fitzpatrick). The film opens with him kissing a twelve year old girl, and it eventually leads to sex after Telly forces the reluctant youth. He gives her the I care about you spiel, as he desperately wants to be the one to take her virginity. The inevitable happens, and afterwards, he meets his pal Casper (Justin Pierce) outside where he heartlessly discusses, in explicit detail, sex with the youth. Words fly to the viewer like bullets in a shootout, and we see the two casually walk up the city block, where they talk loud, shout obscenities, maybe shoplift a bottle of malt liquor, etc. Casper tells Telly that if he were to die tomorrow, he'd be remembered by the girls whose virginity he took for fifty plus years.Kids follows their footsteps in a day in the life kind of fashion. The two go to a drug-dealer's house, have a few hits off a joint, go to a party, get drunk, force each other to answer uncomfortable questions, etc, all in a parent-less, soulless environment. The subplot involves a group of girls, where the film decides to focus on two of them. One of them is HIV negative Ruby (Rosario Dawson in a stunningly offbeat role), who has had sex eight times. The other is HIV positive Jenny (Chloë Sevigny); she had sex once, with Telly. Jenny is sickened with anger and sadness, and drearily plods her way through the day at nightclubs and contemplates what will come of her future with this mishap.The film paints a tragic portrait of American youth. What's worse is the ignorance from parents. Telly stops quickly at his decrepit apartment to steal cash from his mother, kick his cat, and continue to take advantage of his life in a relentless fashion. What spawned such shocking behavior? Most likely years of careless parenting and neglect. His parents, we only see his mother, are hopelessly ignorant towards the fact their son is the degenerate from hell, having sex with young girls for temporary gratification. They ask no questions, possibly because they fear such answers. A shallow, yet common, example of parenting.What a remarkably sad picture this is. What an extremely well written one it is as well. Coming from someone still in school, a lot of it has been heard from me, yet thankfully not endured. It was penned by Harmony Korine, who also made a film I vow to never see. If the film proves anything, it proves that kids need to be taught to formulate an understanding of vital things such as art, philosophy, politics, and film itself. They need to be shown such mediums in order for sustainable growth to occur. My grandmother brought up a point about the vastly growing unemployment rate in America recently, and I think it's one that fits perfectly with this film; how do you expect to have a thriving country when you have louses inhabiting it?

And now, here is Kids, which comes straight out of left field for me. It is a poignantly made picture chronicling the lives of societal degenerates as they hopelessly wander the streets of New York City, unaccompanied and unprotected from the grittiness that lies ahead.Our protagonist is sixteen year old Telly (Fitzpatrick). The film opens with him kissing a twelve year old girl, and it eventually leads to sex after Telly forces the reluctant youth. He gives her the I care about you spiel, as he desperately wants to be the one to take her virginity. The inevitable happens, and afterwards, he meets his pal Casper (Justin Pierce) outside where he heartlessly discusses, in explicit detail, sex with the youth. Words fly to the viewer like bullets in a shootout, and we see the two casually walk up the city block, where they talk loud, shout obscenities, maybe shoplift a bottle of malt liquor, etc. Casper tells Telly that if he were to die tomorrow, he'd be remembered by the girls whose virginity he took for fifty plus years.Kids follows their footsteps in a day in the life kind of fashion. The two go to a drug-dealer's house, have a few hits off a joint, go to a party, get drunk, force each other to answer uncomfortable questions, etc, all in a parent-less, soulless environment. The subplot involves a group of girls, where the film decides to focus on two of them. One of them is HIV negative Ruby (Rosario Dawson in a stunningly offbeat role), who has had sex eight times. The other is HIV positive Jenny (Chloë Sevigny); she had sex once, with Telly. Jenny is sickened with anger and sadness, and drearily plods her way through the day at nightclubs and contemplates what will come of her future with this mishap.The film paints a tragic portrait of American youth. What's worse is the ignorance from parents. Telly stops quickly at his decrepit apartment to steal cash from his mother, kick his cat, and continue to take advantage of his life in a relentless fashion. What spawned such shocking behavior? Most likely years of careless parenting and neglect. His parents, we only see his mother, are hopelessly ignorant towards the fact their son is the degenerate from hell, having sex with young girls for temporary gratification. They ask no questions, possibly because they fear such answers. A shallow, yet common, example of parenting.What a remarkably sad picture this is. What an extremely well written one it is as well. Coming from someone still in school, a lot of it has been heard from me, yet thankfully not endured. It was penned by Harmony Korine, who also made a film I vow to never see. If the film proves anything, it proves that kids need to be taught to formulate an understanding of vital things such as art, philosophy, politics, and film itself. They need to be shown such mediums in order for sustainable growth to occur. My grandmother brought up a point about the vastly growing unemployment rate in America recently, and I think it's one that fits perfectly with this film; how do you expect to have a thriving country when you have louses inhabiting it? Starring Leo Fitzpatrick, Justin Pierce, Chloë Sevigny, and Rosario Dawson. Directed by Larry Clark.

He is best known for producing Child's Play (1988) but Fright Night is no different. It has its freaky and creepy moments too. However there are parts to this movie that could have been tweaked. And it's not like they're totally bad choices because it is a good movie. But those parts could have been replaced with something better if the producers were given the chance to.Fright Night is your typical teenage horror genre movie. A boy notices something supernatural and tries to tell the public about it and no one believes him. Worst of all, now that supernatural force is out to get him so no one will know the truth at all. In this case, the supernatural something that this boy notices is a vampire living next to his house. That plot line is creepy enough as it is. I don't think anyone would feel comfortable if that were to happen to him or her. The teenage boy, Charlie Brewster, is played by William Ragsdale and he's one of the flaws in this film. Ragsdale is good as the kid that he is, but I can't help but not feel any pity for him. Why? Because it was he who got himself into trouble with the vampire. He was spying on the vampire while feasting on his prey. Sorry but you don't go spying on others and expect to get away with it. Besides I really didn't care for his character either because of the nasally voice that he had. However, the vampire played by Chris Sarandon gives a redeeming performance for this movie. Sarandon's acting is so good that it really is hard to tell sometimes whether the vampire he's playing, is mean-spirited or just misunderstood.Getting help for Brewster is not easy until he decides to call upon a renowned Vampire slayer, Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall). Funny enough, even for him, Vincent has to confront with himself that Brewster's case is serious. The special effects are good too. It is fairly surprising for a 1985 film. The only other drawback this movie has, is that it never frightened me and it's not because the visuals weren't scary. It's that the movie never reached the psychological level where things can become truly terrifying and I never felt it. But nonetheless, this film is very creepy.The scares may not be all there but it will definitely evoke some good chills. Much of which the credit goes to Sarandon for his believable execution as a vampire.

The photography, for one thing, is beautiful, showcasing as it does the North West American wilderness.More than this, and the reason why I cut the film a great deal of slack, is its moral core. Costner's character, at a difficult point in his life in this dystopian future, discovers a wrecked mail van, puts on the dead driver's jacket, and decides to deliver the mail to the nearest community as a way to scrounge a meal and a bed for the night. Quite against his expectations he strikes a chord with the community he visits, and they give him mail to deliver to their loved ones whom they have not spoken to in years. So he starts a mail service for his own benefit, but as he brings people messages from people they thought were dead he also brings them hope that life will get better and in the process he becomes a better man.There is a violent conclusion to the movie, but it is not the violence that revives the community but someone bringing people closer together via the mail. For that reason in particular I look kindly on this movie.
