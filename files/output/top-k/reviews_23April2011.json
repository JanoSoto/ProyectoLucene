Francis Ford Coppola used to be THE master of creating melancholic scenes in many of his films! I wish he would go back to do that a few times more before he parts with us one day in the distant future. In Godfather Part II there is a FLASHBACK scene to Godfather part I. I don't know if this scene is a original cut out from Godfather part I, but even James Caan is in this one shot scene where the family is about to have dinner and James Caan starts having a fight with his little brother played by Al Pacino. The scene ends with Al Pacino sitting alone after announcing that he has joined the army during 2nd world war as the rest of the family has rushed off to greet the Godfather who OFF-SCREEN is coming home. Very melancholic scene. The second melancholic scene in Godfather II is the end shot of the film where Al Pacino, the new Godfather, is sitting alone in solitude on a bench in his garden. GREAT, GREAT, GREAT !!! I always loved that scene and it was the end scene of two fantastic masterpieces. HOWEVER, I maid the mistake of watching Godfather part III and that has totally destroyed the memory of that end shot in Godfather part II. So Mr. Coppola that was a dumb move making Godfather III - just my own personal honest opinion. Add to that Sofia Coppola who is not a great actor (a much better director if you ask me) especially in the end scene where she gets shot. It doesn't look real. She acts very badly in that scene. Another mistake by Coppola letting his own daughter act in his film. Would had been OKAY if she was a good actress!!! Over and out for the Godfather films!!!

It's 1930 and the Prohibition war is raging. And thus we have The Untouchables. Al Capone practically runs the corrupt city of Chicago through his illegal liquor distribution. He has the entire city wrapped around his finger until Eliot Ness, a special agent from the treasury department, forms a group of incorruptible cops to take down Capone's entire operation. This group of cops will stop at nothing to uphold the law and bring down organized crime once and for all. And so we have an incredibly enticing Prohibition era tale with enough gangster action for the whole family! The film opens with a vivid overhead shot of Al Capone, played by the magnificent Robert De Niro, having a shave from his barber while reporters shuffle about the room waiting for Capone's face towel to be removed so that they can speak to him. The camera moves in closer to De Niro's face, still overhead. The barber removes his towel and Capone begins to speak about what it's like to be in control of the city and how he runs his crime operation. David Mamet's dialouge flows like gold and De Niro hits every profound line on the nose. In this one initial scene all of the great things about this movie have been established. We have Brian De Palma's excellent visual flare which captures the 1930's so well. We have Mamet's poetic yet raw dialouge that always impresses. And we have the establishment of the superb acting ability in this film, not only from De Niro, but from everyone. And so the film goes from there, telling an exciting story with loads of great characters, dialouge, and action.The Untouchables is loosely based on the 1960's television series of the same name, and it is pretty obvious. The film has a very serial feel to it, with a kind of television dialouge cadence that is also very fitting to the time period. It has a somewhat television look and feel to it, other than being incredibly graphic and loaded with plenty of foul language. It has an adventurous and fun mood, with a kind of mock-seriousness tone to it. But probably what makes it the most classic television-esque would be Ennio Morricone's excellent and commanding score. The score has a very powerful ability to make certain scenes very lighthearted and fun, so much so that you want to get up and cheer for the lovable heroes of this film. Then in other scenes, tragedy strikes and the score is so moving and so gripping that you're taken by surprise at how emotional the film has gotten all of the sudden. The whole film flows like this, making for a strange yet captivating watch.I have to say, don't expect The Godfather or Goodfellas going into this film. The Untouchables isn't nearly as complex and intricate as those films. The Untouchables is a different kind of film. It is driven by its cops and robbers mentality, probably because, unlike the aforementioned films, it is from the perspective of of the good side of the law, rather than the gangsters themselves. The film has to take on a completely different kind of approach to pull off what it is trying to accomplish. It isn't putting the gangsters in a good light. Al Capone isn't a character we pity at all. He is a character we hate, despise, and want revenge on just as much as the heroes of the film do. In all honesty, I prefer the stories told from the gangster point of view, but The Untouchables does an incredible job telling a story from the other side of the law.As far as gangster movies go, The Untouchables is different but great. Visually it is excellent and David Mamet's screenplay is pure genius. The whole cast gives great performances, especially Kevin Costner in the leading role as Eliot Ness. Sean Connery even won an Oscar for his role as Jim Malone, the aging Irish cop who goes about things in his own unique ways. Ennio Morricone lifts the film up with an incredible score that makes the whole film a joy to watch. This film is fun, yet moving, something a lot of films can't find a balance between.

He gets the creatures to prepare everything and kidnaps Santa Claus (Ed Ivory), but Sally (Catherine O'Hara) has a vision that his noble plan will end in disaster.The Nightmare Before Christmas came out of the mind of Tim Burton, starting as a poem before being expanded upon. This is one of Burton's best films, which is ironic because he was only the producer and created the story. But The Nightmare Before Christmas is still very Burtonsque in its look, very dark and Gothic look. Henry Selick is a great stop motion animator and his designs are great for the film. The animation flows brilliantly and I particularly like how the characters moved.The story is simple and very focused, and Selick delivers a fun fast paced film. It has a short running time but it works and Danny Elfman wrote and song some brilliant songs. The songs are energetic, fun and simply delightful and it what you would want from a film like this.

The Nightmare Before Christmas is also funny, whether it's a funny line or a set piece like with the Easter Bunny.

In 2006 there was a 3D re-release of the film and it has become a cultural icon even people who have not seen the film knows elements of it, you can buy merchandise and hoodies with Jack Skellington and I even met a girl at a costume party dressed as Sally from the film. It has even be parodied a number of times.Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon\/singing voice Danny Elfman) is the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town. Ever year he leads frightening festivities and he does it successful. But he is growing tired of his role and he longs for something fresh. After wondering off, Jack stumbles into Christmas Town and after seeing the joy and happiness of this world Jack decides he wants the creatures of Halloween Town to take part. He gets the creatures to prepare everything and kidnaps Santa Claus (Ed Ivory), but Sally (Catherine O'Hara) has a vision that his noble plan will end in disaster.The Nightmare Before Christmas came out of the mind of Tim Burton, starting as a poem before being expanded upon. This is one of Burton's best films, which is ironic because he was only the producer and created the story. But The Nightmare Before Christmas is still very Burtonsque in its look, very dark and Gothic look. Henry Selick is a great stop motion animator and his designs are great for the film. The animation flows brilliantly and I particularly like how the characters moved.The story is simple and very focused, and Selick delivers a fun fast paced film. It has a short running time but it works and Danny Elfman wrote and song some brilliant songs. The songs are energetic, fun and simply delightful and it what you would want from a film like this.

In Arthur 2, he enters the world of adult responsibility. I guess that it is this element of reality, the drunk as a pitiful creature, which makes fans of the original hate the sequel. Those expecting more of the same were sadly disappointed. The premise of a man being forced to fend for himself after a lifetime of privilege is vastly more interesting to that of a drunken playboy and the film, for the most part, rises to this. The ensemble performances are much stronger than in the first film which relied heavily on acerbic one liners and Dudley's comedy drunk routine. Here the interaction between Minelli and Moore is more fleshed out and is delightful. It reminded me somewhat of Jane Fonda and Robert Redford in Barefoot in the Park. The comedy throughout is more subtle and more satisfying than the original. Unfortunately certain cartoon elements from the first film are introduced. Moore's previously innocent ex-girlfriend turns up as a Cruella Deville character before strangely reverting to her former self at the end. And her father hounding Moore wherever he goes is rather silly, it makes him seem like Gargamel. The denouement is especially feeble, with the sudden unexplained character change just mentioned and suddenly every-thing's alright. This terrible finale is the reason I cannot give this a higher mark, although I do consider it a genuine improvement on Arthur 1.It is a pity that this, even more than the original did not follow the courage of its convictions and end with him being poor but following his heart.

The story lines tend to follow the same pattern (1) A group of people buy a house, (2) Strange things happen in the house, (3) The residents try to figure it out, (4) The people finally get out after all the time they wasted beforehand. But I look for both old and new content to see what filmmakers can make out of their movies and how they set them in motion. Director Stuart Rosenberg does not develop much originality in The Amityville Horror which drags with an unstable story, bullet-ridden by plot-holes. Yet the horror in the movie should keep you from walking away.In 1974, a gunman executes his family in his Amityville home during the dead of night (315 am to be exact), supposedly motivated by the will of demons. One year later, the house is purchased by the Lutzes, a normal family starting a new life. They are aware of the history of their new residence but believe houses don't have memories. After moving in, the residents experience paranormal activity and are threatened by hostile spirits during the course of their stay. Much of the Lutzes' testimony has been called to question and is still debated to this day. Watching this movie will create doubts for most viewers but the Lutzes have claimed that much of the events in the film are fictionally altered from their version. I'm a sucker for ghost stories but I also ask questions.The patriarch of the Lutz family, George, is played by a desolate and distant James Brolin. When he's not building fires and acting as inhuman as possible, he's scaring loved ones with his frequent mood swings. If that's not enough for you to start worrying, George regularly wakes up at 315 am. Is this the doing of evil spirits or just the problems of an insecure man? Well, according to George, nothing is wrong even if he and his family get hurt. Margot Kidder is cast as Kathy Lutz, George's wife, to provide a sympathizing character for us. She is the only voice of reason in the family yet remains supportive of her husband. But Brolin and Kidder fail to develop the chemistry of a relationship since there are minimal moments when they have the chance to build it. Nevertheless, Kidder pulls off with a decent performance and shrill screams.What wounds the direction of the story is the distracting focus on unnecessary supporting characters. The detective of Amityville (played by Val Avery) has no real purpose in the film; he's just a bystander of the events yet he is treated as if he might be a part of the story. But I think it's the through-the-roof acting and behavior that helps the supporting cast wreck their roles especially the one for Rod Steiger. He plays as a Catholic priest who is the first visitor to experience the horrors of the house and is the most followed character outside the Lutz family. Steiger's rambunctious yelling topped with his manic, complaining demeanor doesn't give us any reason to take him seriously. His performance makes him look psychotic more than angry and passionate.The logic in The Amityville Horror lacks a deal of common sense and, in turn, damages the storytelling. For instance, the spirits of the house attack guests more than the homeowners. Shouldn't they be terrorizing the people who live in the house and not those who merely visit it? But it is more baffling that some of the visitors would not even bother telling the Lutzes of their suspicions. It also seems odd that the spirits continue to inflict harm upon former visitors when they are nowhere near the house. I guess the dead are easy to offend and hold a strong grudge against the living. Despite its persistent shortcomings in cast and story, The Amityville Horror offers settings and scenery which are impressive for an independent, low-budget film. We see places where darkness cannot lurk such as a bright, lush sanctuary and then we enter the Lutz home. There, the evil finds refuge and interior shadows serve as decorative boundaries during the night. Moods of the settings are effectively reinforced by the music of Lalo Schifrin which swings back and forth from a childlike tune to a more ominous tone. The most iconic image in the movie is the back-end of the house. The design of the back resembles a half-finished Jack-o-lantern with a pair of semi-circular windows for the glaring eyes. Sometimes a red shot of this form gives the house a more sinister look. I would rather live in an apartment in Downtown Los Angeles than a house with a menacing stare. I would normally rate a movie such as The Amityville Horror with a 4\/10 but, this time, I'll award it a 5\/10 for the scare tactics. The horror, as a whole, relies on an unpredictable environment. Quiet moments are followed by enormous bursts of noise guaranteeing a jump or two. There are times when mere people or animals startle you in the most unlikely of places but when the spirits are roused (particularly the ending), you will be ambushed by many frightening sequences that can stick to you like flypaper.My Rating 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 April 2011","score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Sometimes it's inevitable to show mercy towards the clichés in haunted house movies.

For instance, the spirits of the house attack guests more than the homeowners. Shouldn't they be terrorizing the people who live in the house and not those who merely visit it? But it is more baffling that some of the visitors would not even bother telling the Lutzes of their suspicions. It also seems odd that the spirits continue to inflict harm upon former visitors when they are nowhere near the house. I guess the dead are easy to offend and hold a strong grudge against the living. Despite its persistent shortcomings in cast and story, The Amityville Horror offers settings and scenery which are impressive for an independent, low-budget film. We see places where darkness cannot lurk such as a bright, lush sanctuary and then we enter the Lutz home. There, the evil finds refuge and interior shadows serve as decorative boundaries during the night. Moods of the settings are effectively reinforced by the music of Lalo Schifrin which swings back and forth from a childlike tune to a more ominous tone. The most iconic image in the movie is the back-end of the house. The design of the back resembles a half-finished Jack-o-lantern with a pair of semi-circular windows for the glaring eyes. Sometimes a red shot of this form gives the house a more sinister look. I would rather live in an apartment in Downtown Los Angeles than a house with a menacing stare. I would normally rate a movie such as The Amityville Horror with a 4\/10 but, this time, I'll award it a 5\/10 for the scare tactics. The horror, as a whole, relies on an unpredictable environment. Quiet moments are followed by enormous bursts of noise guaranteeing a jump or two. There are times when mere people or animals startle you in the most unlikely of places but when the spirits are roused (particularly the ending), you will be ambushed by many frightening sequences that can stick to you like flypaper.My Rating 5\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Horror"},{"date":"23 April 2011","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Cannot think of a single thing about this movie that needs changing.

No movie, however noble it tries to be, is above criticism if it fails to capture the viewer. And Superman 4's problems completely overshadow any of its noble stances.Let's start with the most obvious flaw, the special (used loosely) effects. Anyone (like those I mention above) who say effects are unimportant to the movie's message need more bran in their diets. Great effects are most important in films such as these to create the illusion that the man we see on screen is really doing what he's doing. The first two Superman films did this, and are classics. Superman 4 fails at even the most basic effects. The flying scenes are the worst; you can see the wires in several shots, and the one particular shot of Superman (and Nuclear Man) coming straight at the camera is seen over and over again. In addition, the effects for space (black curtains) are visible, and there are many examples of bad green screening (the scene where Clark and Lois fall from his balcony being the most blatant).The story is also choppy in its execution. The basic premise is that Superman (Chris Reeve) is trying to destroy all nuclear weapons to protect Earth, but Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) creates Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow) to destroy him. On paper, it's a good start. However, the story is littered with subplots that do little to nothing to advance the story (a direct result of editing 45 minutes out of what was released to theaters). Where did Lenny Luthor (Jon Cryer) come from? Why does Lacy Warfield (played uninspiredly by Mariel Hemingway) have the hots for Clark? How does the computer in the missile with the DNA for Nuclear Man know how to create him AND a costume from simple black material? None of these are explained, and it leaves you confused as to why these characters are important.The actors try their best with the material they have; Reeve turns in as good a performance as you could expect (though he isn't as svelte as he was previously, a minor quibble) as Hackman is good. As I stated, though, Hemingway is a bore as Lacy, and Nuclear Man will forever be identified with the 80s (not to mention Pillow never gets to actually be heard, since Hackman's voice is dubbed over his). That said, if the material was better, the performances would've stood out more.Then there are scenes which leave you simply scratching your head. How does Clark find another green crystal in the spaceship on his farm (didn't he take it out in Superman 1)? Another one is the scene where Superman repairs the Great Wall of China with...Super Repair Vision? I've never heard of him using that in the comics! Of course, the ultimate silly scene is near the end of the movie, when Nuclear Man takes Lacy into space...and she can breathe normally!!! Isn't that physically impossible??? Not to mention it's immediately followed by Superman moving the moon out of orbit to block the sun and take Nuclear Man's power away. Watch out for tidal waves, Earth!In conclusion, Superman 4 will be remembered as a cinematic failure in spite of its intentions to educate the world about the dangers of nuclear weapons. While the actors try hard, they can't overcome the obvious lack of care from the producers about developing the story and making the film look good.

Well it's only part of the plot, as it's a love story at heart and about one following their destiny. To hide it, just add bad ninjas.

A French (I think?) crime kingpin. Ninja magic. lasers&#x85; and so on. Hey there's nothing simple here. You get what you get.

But he's not quite there yet in his training. Surprises wait. His lost memory waits. He's mentor waits. His final lesson waits. Love waits. Destiny waits. This epic waiting game erupts in its big-bang climax.There's so much going on. Does it make much sense? Who knows, but it's a war of the tip-toeing ninjas.

After seeing a dead solider with a ninja star in the forehead. Dramatic power at its best. But stunt-work is just as game. There's an explosive high-speed&#x85; ah slow-speed jeep chase that ends with an almighty explosion when a jeep taps a tree.
