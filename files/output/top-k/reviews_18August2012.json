True there are Native American backdrops, some Native American music and, of course, Native American people but has been dusted with typical Disney fairytale magic and is not to be used as reference to the true story if you want it told accurately. But it wouldn't be Disney to bring the legend to life as such but to bring it to fairytale and fictional twists. Pocahontas' pets Meeko the raccoon and Flit the hummingbird would never have existed in true life, would they? Neither would Grandmother Willow. This was to be suitable for kids as well as grown-ups so Disney did their stuff and the result is very positive yet very underrated. The movie has received major criticism for its inaccuracy. Pocahontas and John Smith are lovers here and history states that they probably weren't at all and it is a known fact that Pocahontas was, in real life, much younger than in her Disney depiction (and not half as beautiful) and John Smith was much, much older than the handsome young man he is depicted to be here but what did the critics expect the film to contain - serious violence, serious war scenes, Pocahontas being held captive for a long time, Pocahontas being murdered at just 21? It'd be ordeal of a film experience for children and here we have a beautiful love story symbolizing the triumph of peace over war; plus brilliant songs, a haunting music score, lush animation and well-selected voice talents.As it is based on a true story, there is some drama here that could never be taken away, even from a Disney adaptation. Also, unlike other Disney fairy tales, we have a sad ending, a very sad ending. If I told you the ending I'd be telling! So you'll have to watch and find out. It is definitely worth your time - it isn't all doom and gloom and adults might also like it.

Sure, one can read about it and watch other documentaries, but there's something to be said about experiencing it in real time with Ali's name in the headlines, proclaiming himself to be The Greatest both in and out of the ring. When We Were Kings is probably an inappropriate title for this film, it plays more like When Ali Was King, even though he wasn't World Champ at the time, having been stripped of the title for refusing the military draft. The picture does a credible job of presenting the behind the scenes machinations to bring the 'Rumble in the Jungle' to fruition, even with a six week delay due to a training injury suffered by Foreman.Thinking back to those days, I had never considered the implications of making the fight a black political statement, though in hindsight I would question allowing the involvement of a dictator like Mobutu Sese Seko putting up the money for the event. As described by Norman Mailer, one of the writers interviewed for the film, Mobutu was a closet sadist who rounded up a thousand criminals and put them in detention pens underneath the fight stadium to remove the threat of criminal activity while the eyes of the world were on his country.Don't expect to see a lot of the eight round fight in this documentary. What you need to know is capably explained by Mailer and fellow sportswriter George Plimpton laying out Ali's strategy and how he approached the fight. Mailer's analysis in particular is helpful in detailing how Ali's right hand leads so enraged Foreman that he used up a lot of his power and energy in trying to destroy him. Quite honestly though, I don't know quite what to make of the 'succubus' story that Plimpton seemed to be so fascinated with.Perhaps the most significant take away I had from the picture was hearing Spike Lee's comments that had nothing to do with the fight. He was speaking of black youth, but I would ascribe his remarks to all colors of a young generation today that remain completely unaware of history, and even worse, are disinterested in learning about it. Most certainly, Muhammad Ali would have something to say about that.

In any category sorted by anyone, Casablanca definitely is included as one of the classics. Its genre is combination of war, romance and drama, and that is exactly what makes it so delightful. Humphrey Bogart (Rick) undoubtedly was one of the finest actors of all time and unanimously speaking, Casablanca is his best. Rick is an excellent epitome of a guy who gets tough and tougher without loosing tender. His former love leaves him high and dry in a train station in Paris and after countless restless nights of pining and sorrow he has moved on and began to run a night club in north of Africa. He is a prominent man in the town ,witty, arrogant, disdainful, clever and showing no interest for politics in spite of his former records .but deep down inside he is so heart-tender ,one of a kind lover and caring about people's lives. Then, one they out of blue, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) , his ex, walks into the bar, with her husband, demanding Sam(piano player) to play as time goes by, and what is more instigating than a piece of music that reminds you of a sacred memory?! Greater the love, greater the tragedy when it's over&#x85; In this movie there exist two distinguished epic scenes that emotionally for sure will change your heart beats. Once approximately in the middle of the movie there was a scene aka as 'The Battle of the Anthems' in which a group of German soldiers had come into Rick's cafe and were intoxicatingly singing the German National anthem loudly. Victor Lazlo(Ilsa's husband), the leader of the French Resistance, cannot stand this act and while the rest of the club stared reluctantly with fear at the Germans, ordered the band to play the French National Anthem, accompanied by a confirming nod from Rick, the band begins playing, with Victor singing at the top of his voice as a pioneer. This inspires the whole club to begin singing along and the Germans are forced to surrender and sit down at their table, humbled by the crowd's dedication. In my book, this was the most appealing part of the movie.In the second place, in the half way through the film a Bulgarian girl comes to Rick asking if Captain Renault is trustworthy. She and her husband are refugees. there is war in their country, they have left their house, they have no money, they are fleeing from death, from misery from fear. they need visas or something and it is inferred that captain Renault has promised her to trade the paperwork they need with couple of minutes of her time&#x85; .now she is in a dilemma.

Stating that in his idea it's better to suffer and murdered than selling one-self. Though he afterwards he does a marvelous thing and helps the husband to win in gambling and provide the money they need to regulates their migration.To put the whole thing in a nutshell, Casablanca is a mixture of all life giving elements. overlapping of humor and drama, love and war, toughness and heart-tenderness.

It's hard to believe this movie came out in 2002. I loved this movie when it first came out, and I still love it even now. Lilo & Stitch is a cute little picture, but not so cute, really, that it treads sappy over-sentimentality territory. Quite simply, you won't find a simpler better animated feature from Disney in the early 21st century.The story begins when the mad scientist Dr. Jumba (voice of David Ogden Stiers) goes on trial for illegally creating a dangerous extraterrestrial life-form, Experiment 626 (voice of co-director Chris Sanders, who shares directing duties with Dean DeBlois). Jumba receives life imprisonment, while Experiment 626 is to be exiled to another planet. As would be expected, the crafty, cunning little blue-skinned bugger that is Experiment 626 masterminds an escape mid-flight, and manages to high-tail it in a space cruiser to Earth, where his ship crash-lands in the woods on the island of Hawaii.The obnoxious and highly destructive little extraterrestrial is mistaken for a mutated dog and is later adopted by Lilo (voice of Daveigh Chase), a lonely, misunderstood young Hawaiian girl, who later renames Experiment 626 as Stitch. Lilo's living with her older sister Nani (voice of Tia Carrere), who is struggling to make ends meet to support them both in the aftermath of their parents' deaths in a devastating car accident. Pretty soon a little family is born - however marginalized - despite the interference of an imposing social worker, Cobra Bubbles (voice of Ving Rhames); and Jumba and alien-government bureaucrat Pleakly (voice of Kevin McDonald), who have been dispatched to Earth to retrieve Stitch at all costs.I have to say Lilo & Stitch somehow feels different from other animated Disney features. Obviously, it's still very much aimed at a general family audience (kids), but it also feels very mature; I don't like being preached to by movies - especially kids movies - but Lilo & Stitch makes the case for family (however bizarre they may sometimes seem, especially when you throw alien fugitives in the mix) and not leaving one behind. We also get a little bit of culture-shock as well, since a great deal of time & effort is spent showcasing Hawaiian native cultures and tradition.The movie itself is great to look at it, with its excellent use of water-based paintings mixed with minimal CGI. Lastly, Stitch is just so cute! I'm a guy, but Stitch is just crazy! Even though Dr. Jumba designed Stitch with only one purpose in life - to destroy anything and everything he comes into contact with - he soon realizes the truth about his own loneliness and isolation and how to come to terms with finding his own place in the universe.This is a fantastic and original Disney animation.

Pretty soon a little family is born - however marginalized - despite the interference of an imposing social worker, Cobra Bubbles (voice of Ving Rhames); and Jumba and alien-government bureaucrat Pleakly (voice of Kevin McDonald), who have been dispatched to Earth to retrieve Stitch at all costs.I have to say Lilo & Stitch somehow feels different from other animated Disney features. Obviously, it's still very much aimed at a general family audience (kids), but it also feels very mature; I don't like being preached to by movies - especially kids movies - but Lilo & Stitch makes the case for family (however bizarre they may sometimes seem, especially when you throw alien fugitives in the mix) and not leaving one behind. We also get a little bit of culture-shock as well, since a great deal of time & effort is spent showcasing Hawaiian native cultures and tradition.The movie itself is great to look at it, with its excellent use of water-based paintings mixed with minimal CGI. Lastly, Stitch is just so cute! I'm a guy, but Stitch is just crazy! Even though Dr. Jumba designed Stitch with only one purpose in life - to destroy anything and everything he comes into contact with - he soon realizes the truth about his own loneliness and isolation and how to come to terms with finding his own place in the universe.This is a fantastic and original Disney animation. I loved it, and you'll love it, too!10\/10 ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"18 August 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" ***SPOILERS*** Disgruntled Vietnam war veteran John Rambo, Sylvester Stallone,is given a chance for a pardon after doing a number on the US Army and a number of local police and law enforcement agencies in the first Rambo\/First Blood flick that landed him in the super secure federal prison The Rock Pile for the criminally incorrigible.

Kuzco also fires Yzma (Eartha Kitt), his adviser, and in her fury she plans to poison him and ruling in his absence. Yzma's dim-witted but lovable henchman Kronk (Patrick Warburton) gives Kuzco the wrong poison, and instead turns him into a llama. She trusts Kronk to finish the job, but he doesn't have the heart to let Kuzco die and eventually loses him amongst the villagers. Stranded in the jungle with his new llama body, he entrusts Pacha to protect him and return him to his palace, without having any intentions of changing his holiday home plans.After a hugely troubled production (the title was originally Kingdom in the Sun and the plot involved a peasant look-a-like and a llama herder love-interest), The Emperor's New Groove arrived in 2000 to enjoy slim box-office success, something that Disney would have to get used to. The decision to swap the old-fashioned love story and moral preachings for a more silly and modern buddy-movie was a wise one, and film benefits especially from the work of Patrick Warburton, the man with possibly the best voice in comedy (he also does the voice of paraplegic Joe in Family Guy). Yet the tale is still an overly-familiar one, with the enlightenment of an ignorant rich kid amongst mixing with the lower- classes failing to find anything original to say.The character of Kuzco is especially loathsome, but where usually the actor\/voice artist would be talented enough to make the character endearing, in the hands of David Space, an actor of such a startling lack of talent, is annoying, and remains annoying throughout. There were times where I felt like shouting at Pacha to just kick him off a cliff. I found the whole experience quite charmless, and in an age of high- definition CGI animation, it is nice to see Disney take a traditional approach. Yet where their early films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Bambi (1942) were drawn with expert beauty and love, Groove just looks lazy and heartless. It's not a total failure, the film is sporadically funny with the aforementioned Kronk getting most of the laughs, and Earth Kitt does some fine work as the twisted Yzma.

Stranded in the jungle with his new llama body, he entrusts Pacha to protect him and return him to his palace, without having any intentions of changing his holiday home plans.After a hugely troubled production (the title was originally Kingdom in the Sun and the plot involved a peasant look-a-like and a llama herder love-interest), The Emperor's New Groove arrived in 2000 to enjoy slim box-office success, something that Disney would have to get used to. The decision to swap the old-fashioned love story and moral preachings for a more silly and modern buddy-movie was a wise one, and film benefits especially from the work of Patrick Warburton, the man with possibly the best voice in comedy (he also does the voice of paraplegic Joe in Family Guy). Yet the tale is still an overly-familiar one, with the enlightenment of an ignorant rich kid amongst mixing with the lower- classes failing to find anything original to say.The character of Kuzco is especially loathsome, but where usually the actor\/voice artist would be talented enough to make the character endearing, in the hands of David Space, an actor of such a startling lack of talent, is annoying, and remains annoying throughout. There were times where I felt like shouting at Pacha to just kick him off a cliff. I found the whole experience quite charmless, and in an age of high- definition CGI animation, it is nice to see Disney take a traditional approach. Yet where their early films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Bambi (1942) were drawn with expert beauty and love, Groove just looks lazy and heartless. It's not a total failure, the film is sporadically funny with the aforementioned Kronk getting most of the laughs, and Earth Kitt does some fine work as the twisted Yzma. But it's no wonder Disney would buy Pixar, as judging from this they were lacking from anything resembling inspiration or innovation.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"18 August 2012","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Summer 1995, what a time to be an impressionable 14-year-old.

If McClane can jump through humiliating hoops for him in a high-stakes game of 'Simon Says' the day will end with no further explosions, but the tasks Simon sets for him are virtually impossible, making McClane suspicious that the revenge plot is just a ruse for something bigger.In the course of his ritual humiliation McClane meets Zeus (Samuel L.

In this case, the home turf is New Orleans. A key element that our detective latches onto is the presence of a sultry young woman who is supposedly the property of the bad guy. Richard Gere probably wouldn't automatically come to a lot of minds as a leading contender for this sort of detective role, but he basically does alright, and he works well with leading lady Kim Basinger; both stars look great as always. But what really helps to make this a decent if unexceptional entertainment for this viewer is that New Orleans setting, which is a very healthy asset to any film set there. That unique New Orleans atmosphere is definitely present and accounted for. The film, competently directed by Richard Pearce, gets down to business quickly and keeps up a pretty good pace while offering a fair bit of excitement and violence. The script, by Jim Carabatsos, doesn't offer anything that's terribly out of the ordinary, but the actors make the most of it. The film *does* feature an excellent supporting cast William Atherton plays yet another of his patented Jerk characters whose lights you just want to punch out the first moment you see him, Gary Basaraba is reasonably likable as the ill-fated partner (you just *know* he's a goner because he's the married one), George Dzundza is solid as Gere's weary boss who ultimately supports him in his quest for vengeance, Terry Kinney is another victim of our bad guy, Bruce McGill is a grumpy N.O. detective, and Dutch actor Jeroen Krabbe, who got effectively introduced to American audiences here, is nicely understated as the villain, sometimes exploding into violence but never going the obvious route of throwing temper tantrums. Look also for Charles S. Dutton in a bit, and the late, great Ray Sharkey in an amusing cameo as Angles Ryan. Good action sequences are a plus, as well as a striking music score by Alan Silvestri, one compelling (and seemingly obligatory) journey through a swamp, and the finale, taking place inside a burning motel, which is a definite corker.

In this case, the home turf is New Orleans. A key element that our detective latches onto is the presence of a sultry young woman who is supposedly the property of the bad guy. Richard Gere probably wouldn't automatically come to a lot of minds as a leading contender for this sort of detective role, but he basically does alright, and he works well with leading lady Kim Basinger; both stars look great as always. But what really helps to make this a decent if unexceptional entertainment for this viewer is that New Orleans setting, which is a very healthy asset to any film set there. That unique New Orleans atmosphere is definitely present and accounted for. The film, competently directed by Richard Pearce, gets down to business quickly and keeps up a pretty good pace while offering a fair bit of excitement and violence.

He wakes up and goes to a normal job, kissing his normal wife goodbye, and greeting all of the normal people in his normal little town. However, I cannot say that The Truman Show is normal. Far from it. It is the originality and uniqueness of this film that makes it so memorable. One day, after years of this ordinary life, he decides he wants to take action and actually gain experiences. To have an adventure or two. The problem is, that as much as he tries, everything is getting in his way. That is when he becomes suspicious about why the world seems to be revolving around his life. All of this pointing to the fact that he is being watched around the clock by the entire world. This is one of those movies that sticks with you long after the credits.

No. Is it better than Ghost of Frankenstein? Yes, I think so. House of Frankenstein is not an outstanding movie, with a story that is a little too silly with scenes that work and some that don't quite, a thin script and a too short length. However, it has great photography and absolutely beautiful sets and costumes. The music is very atmospheric and the sound effects likewise. Most of the scenes show a perfect mixture of laugh, thrills and nostalgic suspense, there is not much that is scary but what there is is effective indeed. The performances are great, there are many characters here but all are a delight to see. J Carroll Naish is a poignant hunchback, Elena Verdugga plays her role sympathetically and Lionel Atwill and George Zucco give fun if brief turns. John Carradine mayn't quite erase memories of Bela Lugosi, but his Dracula is still aristocratically evil, while Lon Chaney Jnr is typically scary-looking and moving as the Wolfman. Boris Karloff with his magnetic presence, imposing make-up and telling eyes dominates the film as Niemann. In conclusion, a fun movie if not quite one of my favourites. 7\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"18 August 2012","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Is House of Frankenstein as good as Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein and Son of Frankenstein?

A possessed car may not be that scary to some people, but the fact that it's based off a Stephen King novel might scare a few people off. The movie is based around this 1957 Plymoth Fury that was maid in Detriot. The owner is consumed by the car that it takes the man's life. The man's brother who is played by Roberts Blossom later sells it to Arnie who is a young high school nerd kid from the late 70s. He is captivated and it consumes him. This movie skirts the edges of material that you may or may not consider to be horrific, yet in the same manner, it keeps you looking over your shoulder if your in the position of one of the high school bullies. The car itself acts like a stalker and the portrayal of it is really well done. Several visual effects shots were needed to give Christine a life-like for for the devil that she is. Most of these shots were very much cheaply done, yet are seamless when played back in movie-time. There is the argument that some can't see such a beautiful muscle car like her be menacing. The thrills are different for a movie like this with a different pace. Hopefully this will not make the reboot list of 80s movie hits because I certainly can't see this movie getting a remake. It's one of those pieces that is unique and has the quality of storytelling that comes only from the masters who create them.
