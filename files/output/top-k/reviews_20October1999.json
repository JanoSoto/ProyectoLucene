The idea has promise, the subtext is relevant (quite often, the 'perfect in-crowd' are the most vicious and reprehensable ones of all, and people who are so perfect just HAVE to go nutty in some way, some time!), the soundtrack was fun, the setting was perfect (little isolated island).  So what went wrong?Well, what bugged me most was the attempt at inventing a Heathers-esque teen language, which kept on intruding in some of the best scenes.  I'd find myself wondering, what the heck did she just say?  'Sounds RIZZO?' ('razor' apparently, but still, it sounds stupid).  Not to mention some really, really terrible dialogue.  In the first five minutes I was subjected to Self-mutilate this, fluid-boy.

What about the parents of these implanted teens, what do they have to say?  What about Caldicott's background, what's his motivation?  Why does the janitor pretend to be crazy (for self-preservation, of course, but this is never really stated)?   How does somebody--who's perfected his 'Boo Radley' act enough to fool everybody--just slip up and leave a Vonnegut novel sticking out of his pocket?

But overall, it was a pretty 'ooky' movie  great premise, terrible execution, though entertaining enough to sit through and enjoy to some extent.  The random violence is effective, the janitor and Gavin are always fun to watch, and there's enough tension to keep you wondering what's going to happen next.The biggest tragedy, of course, is that they didn't do more with what they had.

It was raw,  gritty,  violent and although it has its own technological wonders,  they are far fewer than the ones in Cameron's newer movies,  and I liked the lack of frills.  This story about a woman running for her life from a futuristic cyborg programmed to assassinate her is more human than technological.  I hope that Cameron never loses that quality because I've always admired it and noticed it in every one of his films from THE TERMINATOR to ALIENS to THE ABYSS to T2 to TITANIC.  There's lots of special effects,  but he never fails to breathe life into his human characters.  I am like a lot of people,  I really like Michael Biehn and every movie I've ever seen with him in it.  He never gets the kind of attention he deserves,  and this early role of Kyle Reese,  the human soldier who risked ultimately everything to travel over time to help protect Sarah Connor,  was the first nuanced hint of his amazing talent and is still my favorite role of his.  And I'm certainly glad I'm not strange for thinking that the brief love affair that the two had was a touching and fitting though very surprising ingredient to the story.  To me, the talk that they have about the bleakness and pain that Reese knows is in the future and the sudden and unexpected discovery of their love is making a subtle,  yet profound statement,  like saying hope in the stead of hopelessness,  life in the place of lifelessness,  and joy and love in the place of hate and violence and pain. Okay,  I'm corny,  but this movie really did leave me with the corniness you read.

Now, don't get me wrong, I still love Scream (sequel sucked in a big way - still lookin' forward to 3 though) but with Blair Witch I came to realise the way in which the previously (in my eyes anyway) infallible Scream failed.

His supporting cast was better, if underused (we never got to know Mouse or a handful of the other members of the resistance band).It was the concept that shined and hooked the viewer immediately.SPOILERS AHEADThe idea that we live in an illusion set up by a master race artificial intelligence that uses human bodies in stasis as battery power was horrifying and well presented. The mythology of a prophesied chosen one was a bit shallow; no time was spent explaining how and when this prophesy came to be, or even how long this resistance had been around looking for The One.That made the repeated references to whether Reeves' character was The One annoying, because it was hard to tell why anyone would think he was, and what exactly made him The One to begin with (that is finally explained in a couple of lines in the latter third of the movie).Many people have written about the visual effects in The Matrix, so I won't other than to say they were outstanding. Even better was the fact that the effects had a point; they showed how a person in the simulated world could use his\/her awareness of the simulation to alter the supposed reality. And altering the simulated reality could mean life or death.For the first hour to 75 minutes of The Matrix, I was drawn in and at times mesmerized. Then the bottom fell out.For reasons I thought were unclear, when it came time to rescue the leader of the resistance, Reeves and a fellow rebel choose to storm the enemy citadel and basically blow stuff up. Two people take on a small army of guards and somehow, inexplicably, and with vitually no strategy or stealth, manage to blast their way through to the imprisoned leader. For a movie that took great pains to show us the virtual simulation and how it could be manipulated by those with the ability, abandoning that tack for a plain old blow-em-up was patronizing and insulting. Sure, perhaps the twosome managed to dodge a few bullets through their VR tricks, but not the thousands of rounds sent their way by multiple guards. Why take the chance that you won't get through? Because you are The One and can't be stopped? Please. Then why not just saunter through unarmed?It would have made a lot more sense, and would have been much more satisfying, if the duo had come up with some special maneuvers to use their awareness of the VR to their advantage.The climactic battle between Reeves and the computer's agents was similar. It did make use of a special talent The One had, but otherwise, it was like a kung fu movie. Very disappointing.

The film sets its tone early on and warns you that all of these characters love confrontation and that the heart of the movie is going to be arguing between the leads.

It was that unpleasant. I'm not talking about the amount of blood and gore, but the level of emotion that each of the characters was working on. I can see that this movie is attempting to be a dark comedy, but it just becomes far too dark to save itself for a few good laughs. The amount of screaming and whining I had to endure throughout was nothing short of aggravating and I found myself not really caring what happened to the characters... be it good or bad. This is where I had a problem with the film. I just didn't care about the characters. I didn't find myself wanting to see them get punished for what they'd done, nor did I want there to be a happy ending for those of them who were truly guilt-ridden. There was only so much shouting and bickering that I could take, before I was left wanting the movie to end before I found out what happened. I mean the nastiness of each of them wasn't even entertaining.  Despite the fact that I found the film truly forgettable, which is strange considering the amount of shock-value the film held, I did think that the performances were all solid and did nothing to damage the already doomed story. At the end of the day, the film was just too confused with what it wanted to be, leaving me feeling much the same way in my interpretation of it.

This is where I had a problem with the film. I just didn't care about the characters. I didn't find myself wanting to see them get punished for what they'd done, nor did I want there to be a happy ending for those of them who were truly guilt-ridden. There was only so much shouting and bickering that I could take, before I was left wanting the movie to end before I found out what happened. I mean the nastiness of each of them wasn't even entertaining.  Despite the fact that I found the film truly forgettable, which is strange considering the amount of shock-value the film held, I did think that the performances were all solid and did nothing to damage the already doomed story.

The film has been called an allegory for Brazil an its contemporary problems.  While a national director has no obligation to 'explain' his country to the uninitiated, some of Salles' references can be opaque to the outsider.  The Central Station itself seems to represent a confluence of all the ghastly failures of modern Brazil from which our heros escape to find a kind of order.  Untranslated slogans permeate the film, placenames seem to be weightily resonant, characters and situations seem to belong more particularly to this culture.And yet the film has been acclaimed worldwide.  This is presumably because it uses that age-old universal structure - the quest.  The film actually conflates two in its storyline - the search of a young boy for his father (and hence, I presume, his place in society, masculinity, Brazilian heritage etc.), and an old woman's regaining her identity and humanity.When we first see Dora, she is a maliciously detached, cold, godlike figure, a letter-writer in a shockingly illiterate Brazil, mocking and abusing the unfortunates who put their trust in her.  At one point she sells the recently bereaved boy to buy a new TV.  Her tragedy is her frigid solipsism, and the film traces her emotional thawing, her move from an imperious, sterile, changeless present, to her recognition of her place in history (her reciting family memories), and her own identity as a woman who belongs to a community of others, accountable to others (see the many mirror scenes; her putting on lipstick to reclaim her feminity).  By the end she realises that letters and writing are not irrelevancies, but possessed of a fetishistic power, representing real people and hope.Her quest is heavily linked with religious imagery - she and the boy evoke the Madonna and child; the pair's bleakest moment is played out against a religious rally straight out of the Dark Ages. The very real power of this nocturnal scene, though, is revealed to be Elvis-like kitsch by daylight.The boy's quest, beginning like a Roald Dahl story with the almost whimsical death of a mother, is framed as a road-movie, heavily quoting those classics of the genre - THE SEARCHERS and PARIS, TEXAS.  His journey is an attempt to impose order on the chaos represented by Central Station, but life is less malleable than this.  Those films' conclusions are here reversed the missing relative isn't found, but the hero does find a family.  Indeed, his father takes on the quality of a benevolent Godot-like figure.The film is saved from maudlin sentimentality (an unforgivably lush score softens any of the horrors the film hints at) by a refusal to simplify or seek easy closure; by a very ambiguous, problematic and arguably misogynistic ending; and by the remarkably tough perfomance of Fernanda Montenegro.

She might as well add either do screenwriters....Shakespeare in Love has many qualities that make it a better than average film.   The sets are excellent, the costumes are beautiful, and the acting,for the most part, was first rate.   The script is witty, and filled with cute, little inside jokes for those familiar with the plays and literature of Elizabethan England.That being said, in my opinion there are some serious flaws, which cause it to be quite a bit inferior to other films nominated for the &#145;98 Oscars.  Yet it is obvious that what I consider to be flaws, Hollywood considers virtues.   My review is for those who find this film to be less than virtuous.The only thing this film has in common with the historical Shakespeare is the name Shakespeare.   This is a highly fictionalized account of his life; however, I do not consider this a flaw.   It is obvious that the writers are using Shakespeare as a vehicle to create a parable of the Hollywood film industry, complete with sex, money and psychoanalysts.  The use of Shakespeare for this end is actually quite clever.  In this day and age, where biographers feel free to inject themselves as a fictional character into the historical  biographies they write, then this fictionalization of Shakespeare is par for the course.   The screenwriters also are interested in presenting a possible motivation for Shakespeare's writing of Romeo and Juliet Shakespeare was madly in love at the time. Yet it is in the handling of the love story that I've encountered the film's most serious flaw.The film's two lead characters; Shakespeare played by Joe Fiennes and Viola played be Gwyneth Paltrow; have a mutual love-at-first-sight attraction to each another.   This attraction is quickly followed up by consummation in Viola's bedroom - an activity in which the two of them engage in rather frequently throughout the course of the film.  Often they recite lines from Romeo and Juliet to each other while copulating.About midway through the film, Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench) states Playwrites teach us nothing of love;  they make it pretty, they make it comical or they make it lust - they cannot make it true. This piece of dialogue is the hinge upon which this whole film turns - and with it a wager is struck in response to the queen's  query Can a play show us the very truth and nature in love?Of course a play can show us the very truth and nature in love - hence the film's thesis the motivation behind Shakespeare's writing of Romeo and Juliet!  Unfortunately, the film attempts, by association,  to take that challenge upon itself as well.  In my opinion, it fails miserably.   This is just another example of a pretty, comical, and lusty Hollywood film - nothing more.  I did not come away with an enlightened viewpoint of love and truth - rather I thought it more of a highbrow pseudo porn flick.  Sorry - two lovers reciting Shakespeare to each other while doing the horizontal bop does not bring clarity to the meaning of love to this reviewer.As I stated earlier, this is not an Oscar caliber film, and didn't even deserve the nomination.  All the other nominated films were far more ambitious and told much more compelling stories.  So why then DID this film get nominated - let alone win best picture???Well, one has to keep in perspective the two films before it that have won Oscars - The English Patient and Titanic.   Shakespeare in Love kept lockstep with the philosophical underpinnings of those two films, and by towing the party line, endeared itself to the Hollywood elite who votes for these things.The English Patient, Titanic, and Shakespeare in Love all deal with a woman either promised to or married to a man who they either despise or find less than desirable.   Then comes along the love of their lives, and, despite the woman's engagement\/marriage convenant, they go  off and embrace their forbidden love.  Hence we are subtlety told that marriage\/engagement is an evil that keeps one from finding true happiness.  In order for these films to work, they have to resort to times and places where woman had much less freedom of choice than they do today.  But the underlying message remains the same for all three.In Hollywood USA, marriage is probably viewed in that way by many involved in the entertainment industry a sort of ancient, masochistic custom that has outlived its usefulness.  Any film that portrays marriage as an obstacle rather than a blessing finds quite a receptive audience amongst the moral relativists who make up the film industry.

If there's any subject that could be considered taboo in Hollywood, then virginity has to be it.  Hence, this film didn't have a chance.`Saving Private Ryan' was a throwback to old fashioned ideas like duty,' honor, and worst of all, self-sacrifice - none of which play that well in modern day Southern California (except when the sacrifice of self is used for the preservation of the forbidden love...)    The Thin Red Line - makes the terrible error of showing how one's adultery can have a rather negative impact on the adulterer's spouse - a concept unheard of in the land of self-indulgence without consequences.

The Thin Red Line - makes the terrible error of showing how one's adultery can have a rather negative impact on the adulterer's spouse - a concept unheard of in the land of self-indulgence without consequences.   And don't even get me started on Life is Beautiful....If you think that Shakespeare in Love WAS the best film of '98, then I have a few others for you to try on for size Savior, Pi, Rushmore and Dark City.  They all are far more compelling than SIL could ever hope to be.

Stewart plays his character constantly inebriated and 'oh-so-pleasant' and you can't help but warm to his misunderstood Mr Dowd.  His family want him committed for his belief that he has a constant companion that just happens to be an invisible white rabbit over 6' tall...but I think today they'd want to commit him more for his constantly happy attitude and desire to be friends with everybody, especially those not normally noticed.  But in being so pleasant, his life is the smartest one of all, and, not surprisingly, leaves him untouched by worries (with a little help from his invisible pal).The movie is whimsical and genuinely funny and was made in the perfect time when it comes to acting styles and production values.  This movie could not be made today and retain its charm or even its humour, and I doubt any one could ever match Jimmy Stewart in the main role.For its time, its place and its purpose, 10 out of 10.

After watching the movie in Lubbock, Texas, some friends and I went and talked about it for more than an hour.  How often do you talk about a movie over dinner these days?  Annette Bening was marvelous.  I wanted to know more about her character.  What happened to Carolyn?  At the end of the movie, it seemed that Carolyn was asking herself the same question.  Kevin Spacey was also very good, as were Thora Birch and Wes Bently.  Dreamworks should be very proud of this movie.
