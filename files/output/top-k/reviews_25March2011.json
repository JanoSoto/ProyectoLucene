Steve Buscemi has a major role as Seymour, a dork adopted by Enid as her person of interest, and Bob Balaban, Teri Garr, John Malkovich, and David Cross have roles as well.Enid and Rebecca are realistically shown as typical high schoolers who spend their time putting down other people (losers, dorks) and laughing at them. Although they denigrate everyone, the two girls offer no constructive ideas or alternatives, which is typical high school behavior for American teens. The problem brought out by Clowes and Zwigoff is that the two girls are on the cusp of becoming those others. Rebecca gets a job and has to deal with lousy customers and crappy bosses, but she has to make a living.Enid gets a job but refuses to accept things as they are, insults her customers, and gets fired on her first day. The problem is, she wants to rent an apartment with Rebecca, and that takes money, and that means having a job.One can view Rebecca as the more mature of the two, since she clearly understands the nature of making a living. Enid can't let go of her high school behavior and move into young adulthood. While most teens are aimless in high school, at some point the kids gain some focus and move into adulthood where they have goals and plans. We see Rebecca making that growth, but we also see Enid remaining aimless.Enid played a prank on Seymour, whom she identifies correctly as a dork loser, but runs into him at a yard sale and discovers that although he's a loser dork, there's a real human in those ill-fitting, ugly clothes. Seymour realizes he is who he is and has more or less accepted it. Enid makes it her project to get him dates. Buscemi is excellent as Seymour, making him human in spite of his dorkiness. Seymour seems to be the one person Enid identifies with and cares about, much to the amazement and disdain of Rebecca. Seymour briefly gives Enid something to work for, but she's unable to make anything of herself in her efforts to get Seymour a life. In the end, her aspirations remain childish.What really interests me about the movie is that there is no success. Ghost World does not have a happy ending. Enid screws everything up for Rebecca, Seymour, and herself. And then the movie ends. This is not a happy teen flick where the geeks go on to college and the cheerleaders get their comeuppance. This is not a coming of age flick where the kids all learn from their immature behavior and then grow up. The ending is something of a puzzle. I believe it was intentionally left open to interpretation, so I'll leave that for you to see and decide for yourselves. Although the main characters are high school girls, this is definitely a movie for grownups who think.

No duh. That's the collective opinion of many people who've seen it. It's disgusting! It's sooo nasty! Yuck! But it's much more than filth and sleaze. It's a masterpiece.It's a masterpiece of gore and sex and history, rolled into one weird package. Though not historically accurate in all respects, it is pretty literal when it comes to bringing the horrors of Caligula to life on screen. Those who aren't familiar with the emperor Caligula, or any of the Julio-Claudian emperors for that matter, won't notice much but the Roman history buffs will be annoyed that this film focuses less on the story of Caligula's life, and more on his perverse and strange acts of tyranny and sex. There is castration, fellatio, decapitation, fisting, anal, oral, the list goes on and on. He makes his horse consul, screws his sister, leads the armies on useless expeditions, violently massacres people, rapes a bride and groom, turns his palace into a brothel and does many other stupid things. But hey, Guccione and Brass never intended to flatter Caligula. The film starts off with a biblical passage, For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul. - Mark 836 How very scary. The beginning is ominous, a pulsing rhythm pounding in the background, a sort of odd Pagan music. Then we see Caligula frolicking (to say the least) in the woods with his sister, Julia Drusilla. From there on starts a bizarre two and a half hour odyssey of absurdity.You might ask, what the hell is good, much less great, about this movie? There are many reasons why I consider Caligula brilliant.The acting, for one. Malcolm McDowell was born to play the role of the mad emperor. He portrays Caligula as a cheeky bastard, a real son of a bitch who's a pervert and a madman. Malcolm gives the performance of a lifetime, outshadowing even his roles as Alex DeLarge in A Clockwork Orange and Mick Travis in If...Quite simply one of the best performances I've ever seen. Malcolm becomes Caligula, he descends deeply into the character and becomes insane himself.Peter O Toole is amazing as the sick and volatile Tiberius. You can see him laughing during the elevator scene, laughing at the stupid absurd role he was playing and how his career was going down the drain, laughing at himself because he was surrounded by a bunch of naked Italian B-movie actors and Penthouse pets. Even he couldn't take the whole damn thing seriously. John Gielgud as the suicidal Nerva and Helen Mirren as the faithful but skanky Caesonia were a nice addition. The music, is another thing. Aram Ilyich Khachaturian's Spartacus is haunting and beautiful. Prokofiev's Dance of The Knights (AKA Montagues and Capulets) is simply stunning. It's played during the beginning credits and it sets the tone for the entire movie. Intense and atmospheric and powerful.The dialogue is also great. During the credits we hear Caligula say I have existed from the morning of the world, and shall exist until the last star falls from the heavens. Although I have taken the name of Gaius Caligula, I am all men as I am no man, and so, I am a god. Gore Vidal at his best. Some people say the script is cheezy or stupid, but I think it's great. Caligula is Roman decadence, personified. The horror and indulgence of the Romans is portrayed wonderfully in this film. It's the best representation of Rome, along with the miniseries I Claudius and Fellini's masterpiece Satyricon. The nudity and violence are excessive, but most Romans were indulgent and depraved by this time period. Gone were the days of art and poetry, the days of bloodshed and the abuse of power had begun. Besides, you can't exactly make a PG Disney movie on the life of Caligula.This movie also made me obsessed with Roman history, especially Caligula himself. Rarely has a film gripped me so powerfully.Although I do think Caligula is an outstanding film, it obviously could've been better. Tinto Brass had something, he was making something different, maybe not Citizen Kane, but still, he'd got something special. Then Bob the perv Guccione came along and was angry that his money was being wasted, so he and his buddy edited Caligula and tore it apart and replaced key moments with porno scenes. Oh, what could've been! Well too bad. This is the result of serious miscommunication between producer and director. People think that Caligula lacks artists merit because they assume that it's a porno because it was produced by Penthouse. If Salo is a masterpiece, why can't Caligula be a masterpiece? Why the hell not? Just because Salo was directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini. If Bob Guccione had decided to make a movie version of Salo, it'd be panned, but if Pasolini made Caligula, it'd be praised to the skies. I give Caligula a 10, just for the pure shock value of it. What a brave and bold film. You'll never see a movie like this again, ever. People compromise nowadays, censorship prevails. Who would have the guts to make such filthy mainstream movie? No one.In conclusion, Caligula is a powerful, amazing film that is horrific and magnificent at the same time. Throughout the whole time I watched it, I was filled with dread, terrified at what would happen next. At times it was hard to swallow (get the pun?). The rating of 4.9 is ridiculous. Some people couldn't handle the nastiness, apparently. Watch it....if you have the guts to. They'll probably be torn out by the end.

You can see him laughing during the elevator scene, laughing at the stupid absurd role he was playing and how his career was going down the drain, laughing at himself because he was surrounded by a bunch of naked Italian B-movie actors and Penthouse pets. Even he couldn't take the whole damn thing seriously. John Gielgud as the suicidal Nerva and Helen Mirren as the faithful but skanky Caesonia were a nice addition. The music, is another thing. Aram Ilyich Khachaturian's Spartacus is haunting and beautiful. Prokofiev's Dance of The Knights (AKA Montagues and Capulets) is simply stunning. It's played during the beginning credits and it sets the tone for the entire movie. Intense and atmospheric and powerful.The dialogue is also great. During the credits we hear Caligula say I have existed from the morning of the world, and shall exist until the last star falls from the heavens. Although I have taken the name of Gaius Caligula, I am all men as I am no man, and so, I am a god. Gore Vidal at his best. Some people say the script is cheezy or stupid, but I think it's great. Caligula is Roman decadence, personified. The horror and indulgence of the Romans is portrayed wonderfully in this film. It's the best representation of Rome, along with the miniseries I Claudius and Fellini's masterpiece Satyricon. The nudity and violence are excessive, but most Romans were indulgent and depraved by this time period. Gone were the days of art and poetry, the days of bloodshed and the abuse of power had begun. Besides, you can't exactly make a PG Disney movie on the life of Caligula.This movie also made me obsessed with Roman history, especially Caligula himself. Rarely has a film gripped me so powerfully.Although I do think Caligula is an outstanding film, it obviously could've been better. Tinto Brass had something, he was making something different, maybe not Citizen Kane, but still, he'd got something special. Then Bob the perv Guccione came along and was angry that his money was being wasted, so he and his buddy edited Caligula and tore it apart and replaced key moments with porno scenes. Oh, what could've been! Well too bad. This is the result of serious miscommunication between producer and director. People think that Caligula lacks artists merit because they assume that it's a porno because it was produced by Penthouse. If Salo is a masterpiece, why can't Caligula be a masterpiece? Why the hell not? Just because Salo was directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini. If Bob Guccione had decided to make a movie version of Salo, it'd be panned, but if Pasolini made Caligula, it'd be praised to the skies. I give Caligula a 10, just for the pure shock value of it. What a brave and bold film. You'll never see a movie like this again, ever. People compromise nowadays, censorship prevails. Who would have the guts to make such filthy mainstream movie? No one.In conclusion, Caligula is a powerful, amazing film that is horrific and magnificent at the same time. Throughout the whole time I watched it, I was filled with dread, terrified at what would happen next. At times it was hard to swallow (get the pun?). The rating of 4.9 is ridiculous. Some people couldn't handle the nastiness, apparently. Watch it....if you have the guts to. They'll probably be torn out by the end.

Do you people think that's what makes a great movie? I grew up with Ernest(since his Sprite commercial) and have continued to watch him for over 25 years. I loved him then. I love him now. In fact, I appreciate Varney's brand of humor now more than ever. While most kids' shows today are aimed at playing down to a child's intelligence, making them feel as if they're on the bottom rung of things, the 'Ernest' movies never did that. (This movie was made in the 80's and I still think it's the smartest kids' movie out there.) Ernest never lectured a child, he never made them feel inferior. He made them feel like their opinions were just as important as his. He treated them as equals and children really gravitate toward that. I know I did. That 'children are meant to be seen and not heard' is a load of crap and it was quite obvious Ernest didn't believe in that saying. 'Ernest Goes to Camp' is just one of my favorites that I can't get enough of. Ernest is Kamp Kikakee's 'fix it' guy but dreams of becoming a Camp Councelor, but no one will give him a chance. That is until a group of Juvenile delinquents are selected to join Kamp Kikakee for the summer. Automatically, almost every counselor, especially Councelor Stennis, thinks the worst of them and treats them as such. You treat a kid like a misfit, they'll act like one. You treat a kid like they're worth something, they'll truly shine. Case in point, Stennis gets pushed into the water by the boys after he throws Moose into the lake, knowing he can't swim. No one wants to help the boys so they decide to 'dump' them onto Ernest by giving in to his wish of becoming a counselor. And that's only because they don't want to 'fool' with the boys themselves. At first, all of Ernest's attempts to get the boys interested in camping activities are met with practical jokes, stunts and a mockery of Ernest. But, being Ernest, he refuses to give up on the boys. Eventually, his perseverance pays off and the boys start believing in themselves and their abilities to do something positive with their lives. Sherman Krader of 'Krader Mining Company' wants the land(in the worst way) that Kamp Kikakee sits on to mine a fictitious mineral known as Petrocite and his greed makes him a very dishonest and hostile man. He eventually cons Ernest into talking the Chief into signing over the land, telling Ernest that it's a petition instead of a lease. Ernest and Nurse St. Cloud are the only ones that are able to communicate with the chief. After figuring out that he got taken, Ernest tries to fix it by confronting the foreman in charge of the activities of the mining company. It turns out that the foreman is a mammoth of a guy. Ernest still faces him in a fight even though he knows he won't win but feels he has to stand up for the camp and the boys. After getting beat up, all the boys, but Moose, turn on him once more. Ernest feels terrible and thinks he let down the entire camp. This is the part where Ernest sings 'Gee, I'm Glad It's Rainin''. This song is quintessential Ernest and could've been his theme song in every movie. What they wanted was a hero. All I needed was a friend. He sings it so heartbreakingly beautiful and the pain is evident in his blue eyes. After Nurse St. Cloud scolds the boys, telling them how Ernest was the only one to stand by them, they band together and convince Ernest to help them stop Krader Mining Company. Together, with the uplifting song, 'Brave Hearts', they construct contraptions and a catapult loaded down with bombs, fire arrows and 'turtle paratroopers', they blow up the equipment that Krader Mining Company had on the premises. Ernest finally gets his chance to knock out the foreman when his dozer gets hit with the cart loaded with flammable material. Krader is fed up with being stopped, so taking his rifle, he intends to shoot Ernest. Going back to the opening of the movie, Nurse St. Cloud's narrates the story of the stone, blade and arrow. No matter how good Krader's aim is, he always misses Ernest. Finally, Krader points the rifle point blank in Ernest's face, but Ernest plugs up the rifle, saying, Paper, rock, scissors, his version of the stone, blade and arrow. Krader knows he lost and makes a run for it. Krader's attorney admits that the chief was conned into signing the lease. The campers get Kamp Kikakee back and Ernest is now a year round counselor. The ending credits are great, with the song 'Brave Hearts' by Gary Chapman playing in its entirety. The words are wonderful and play into the theme of the entire movie. I recommend this movie highly if you're looking for good, honest, clean fun with a great moral message. Varney's talents are sorely missed.

Studying Hamlet in school I had a hard time understanding how Hamlet's girl Ophelia went mad. Here the motivation is not only clearer but we see her in the process of her madness.We get from this version a wonderful performance by Kenneth Branaugh as the young prince who gets a visit from his father's ghost to inform him that it was his uncle that murdered him and now occupies the throne and the bed chamber of Hamlet's mother. But how to accuse the king of murder without making everyone think that you've gone completely mad? Most of the versions of this play have trimmed the fat and only given us the bare bones. This film is able to explain a few things and more, to help me understand motivations the play's message of mortality.I have never been able to understand how Claudius was able to convince sister-in-law Gertrude to marry him so soon after the king's death. Derek Jacobi brings such charm to the role that it's not only clear how he charmed he new wife but how he masterminded his brother's death as well. Much to our surprise and dismay, we sort of begin to understand why he did it. Key pieces of dialogue have been restored that flesh out the characters even more.Branaugh knows that the dialogue is key to the characters but also understands that the atmosphere of the castle plays a key role as well. The production design by Tim Harvey and Desmond Crowe are breathtaking suggesting a court of infinite secrets, not just a medieval castle of horrors. The opening scenes at the wedding of Claudius and Gertrude is a sight to behold with a hall that seems to stretch back and back and back into infinity. The throne room with it's wall of mirrors, some of which are passageways, leads to one of the most original scenes &#x96; Hamlet's To be or Not to be soliloquy spoken to a mirror with people hiding behind it. Is he talking to them or his own reflection? Are his questions in the reflection coming back at him? Then something else happens that I've never seen before in any version of Hamlet &#x96; a flashback of Yorich. During his scene in the graveyard he begins questioning the skull of the king's favorite buck-toothed clown. We flash back to the time when he played horsey with the young Hamlet. Then a close-up and a dissolve to the skull in Hamlet's hands with the buck-teeth still in it. The question of mortality remains but in Kenneth Branaugh's hands it hits home.Branaugh's performance as Hamlet is never morbid or redundant. He lashes out, overplays and uses wild gestures as he masterminds a plan to bring his uncle's guilt to the surface without making everyone think that the prince himself has gone off his rocker. This is key because making Hamlet into a pitiful slump distracts from what he does later in the play. He wonders about the matters of life and death, both physical and spiritual but Branaugh does it with curiosity not misery.I have never been so entertained by a filmed version of Shakespeare. Branaugh throws away the stogy, stagy elements that turn many people off of Shakespeare. But he really brings this film to life, not just the words but the actions. This is a man completely in love with this masterful play, he knows it we sense and I for one am grateful to have witnessed it.

During his scene in the graveyard he begins questioning the skull of the king's favorite buck-toothed clown. We flash back to the time when he played horsey with the young Hamlet. Then a close-up and a dissolve to the skull in Hamlet's hands with the buck-teeth still in it. The question of mortality remains but in Kenneth Branaugh's hands it hits home.Branaugh's performance as Hamlet is never morbid or redundant. He lashes out, overplays and uses wild gestures as he masterminds a plan to bring his uncle's guilt to the surface without making everyone think that the prince himself has gone off his rocker. This is key because making Hamlet into a pitiful slump distracts from what he does later in the play. He wonders about the matters of life and death, both physical and spiritual but Branaugh does it with curiosity not misery.I have never been so entertained by a filmed version of Shakespeare. Branaugh throws away the stogy, stagy elements that turn many people off of Shakespeare. But he really brings this film to life, not just the words but the actions. This is a man completely in love with this masterful play, he knows it we sense and I for one am grateful to have witnessed it.

Its budget, its Oscar-winning special effects, its blockbuster status as the highest-grossing movie of 1996 - yeah, all in all, Independence Day is a big movie, a really big movie. It has a plot that is somewhat of a modern-day revisionist update of H.G. Wells's turn-of-the-century alien invasion epic The War of the Worlds. It also has an all-star cast consisting of Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Vivica A. Fox, and Randy Quaid. When massive 15-mile wide alien spaceships darken the skies over the world's major cities, the people of planet Earth are caught in spectacle. But wonder turns to out-right terror when the alien ships begin raining down destructive beams all over the major cities and killing millions in the process. Why do they do it? They're after our natural resources, we learn; they just want to wipe us out first to make it easier for them to get what they want and leave. The plot isn't the best or even the most original aspect of this movie; that's not the point. What master of disaster director Roland Emmerich wants to deliver is special effects, awesome scenes of extraterrestrial destruction, and action scenes detailing humanity's brave fight back against the technologically superior alien menace. Independence Day, for the longest time, was my favorite movie of all time; I lived and breathed it. All I could talk and think about was Independence Day, and I'm not sure how or why I didn't wear out my VHS tape from so many repeated viewings. 15 years later, this movie is still as thrilling and entertaining as it ever was.

All I care about is the alien invasion and humanity's desperate struggle to fight back. I could care less if it's patriotism before 9\/11 made uber-patriotism the hot new thing to be in America.

Its called willingly suspending your disbelief. The elements in this film are Shyamalan's, which he imaginatively wrote and put together as he saw fit. So forget what most sci-fi resources would say in terms of what would be more likely to happen if aliens made contact with humans.Most of the entire story and events are revolved around the Hess family on their country property. The television and radio are the only things that even remotely show what is happening to other places around the world. This is extremely effective. It allows the audience to be more engaged and attached to the Hess family.The acting is phenomenal, absolutely pristine. This is my favorite Mel Gibson movie. His performance as a beloved father struggling to cope with the loss of his wife with abandoned faith is outstanding. The dinner scene and the ending is where he really works his magic.Joaguin Phoenix is a perfect addition to the cast, as a charming, yet still caring younger brother living with Mel Gibson.You couldn't ask for better child acting from Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin as the kids of Mel Gibson's character (Graham) The film is surprisingly funny. Quite frequently there are golden touches of humour in the first 3\/4 of the movie.It is perfectly suspenseful. Not showing the audience everything at once, but little bits at a time is the perfect trick. Then when the ending comes around, Bam! Oh jeez this is intense!

I think she then did a later film called 'Ash Wednesday' to reverse the procedure.Anyway, Liz and Dick were married in real life and it was reported that they had similar encounters with Jack Daniels and boisterous 'conversations' at home, so this should have been a walk-in-the-park acting job for both of them.But, it was awful. The story was repulsive as were all the characters. I feel that trying to analyze drunken behavior in a movie is a pointless endeavor that, for some reason, actors and directors think is a life affirming philosophic inquiry......or something. I would compare this to trying to pass a driving test while drunk. It doesn't work.Burton does his usual Shakespearean speechifying. Taylor is a caricature of whatever she is supposed to be. Bette Davis's Baby Jane Hudson was more real and realistic than Martha. At times, the lighting and camera work inside the house reminded me of very early 1950s TV soap operas.All in all, a lousy evening for the 4 of them and me.

Guess I should start with letting people know that while I almost never include spoilers for the courtesy of others, I really feel the need to make an exception with For Your Eyes Only. On a positive note, the spoilers I will give are few and will not ruin the viewer's experience. For those who read my previous Bond review I stated that Never Say Never roughly takes place in between Moonraker and Your Eyes Only. As a number of you know, For Your Eyes Only came out a year before Never Say Never. This is where the first spoiler comes in In Never Say Never, we see the return of Blofeld who headed the Spectre criminal organization thought to have been killed off in Diamonds Are Forever. In Your Eyes Only, Bond finally finishes off Blofeld near the start of the film. Despite Never Say Never being an unofficial 'EON' release and a loose yet much improved remake of Thunderball, For Your Eyes Only should have come out in between Never Say Never and Octopussy as far as I'm concerned. NOW BACK TO THE INITIAL REVIEW For Your Eyes Only delivers most of what 007 fans have come to enjoy regarding a super spy action flick. Still, having come out after Moonraker I can see how some viewers might have found this movie to be a bit of a letdown. The previous Roger Moore bond films had reached a good peak for the series at the time with supposed future technology and special effects. Your Eyes Only somewhat clumped a rehash of previous action\/effect sequences used in previous 007 films going as far back to Her Majesty's Secret Service. Normally this is fine and has worked even for some of the later Bonds to come yet in this particular instance, it seems overdone and cliché. Just watch and you will see what I'm talking about. As for the villain of this 007 title, he is very mundane and uninteresting as was the villain Largo from Thunderball (Ironically, the Largo character in Never Say Never was quite improved upon). Mind you, none of the critiques above should discourage anyone from watching this movie. In fact, the bond woman in this is one of my favorites. This is because her character is not the predictable damsel in distress as we have seen in many 007 films. She is independent, a trained fighter, intelligent, and very good looking. As for the music, the theme song to Your Eyes Only is one of the tunes that stand out to me from the bond series. The other tunes I liked were from Goldfinger, Live Let Die, Man with Golden Gun, and Spy Who Loved Me. On a final note, this movie is worth viewing though I will strongly suggest watching it after Never Say Never and also watching it before Octopussy even though nothing connects it to the latter bond title. While some readers will disagree with me on this review and quite possibly Never Say Never, hopefully all readers will have found my reviews informative.

Scarface is more than that. Without giving too much of the plot away, the movie is about Tony Montana, a small time crook who dreams of making it to the top. The film very explicitly follows this man's life as he starts in the slums of Florida as a Cuban immigrant with nothing who ends up climbing the ranks to a big drug dealer that owns a mansion. The morals of the plot are the American Dream&#x85;for a gangster and how it tears a person apart. Scarface is in a sense a tragedy. A man who gets everything only to destroy what he truly loves. People have regarded Tony Montana as Al Pacino's greatest role. I was somewhat skeptical about this role. I mean, an Italian actor playing a Cuba? C'mon. Yet, he pulls it off brilliantly, even retaining the proper accent. Pacino is completely over the top as Tony. He is brutal, selfish, paranoid, even an addict of the product he sells&#x97;just complete filth. Nevertheless, it is easy to sympathize with his character. No other actor could pull off Tony Montana as good as old Al. Though Pacino makes the movie, he isn't the only great actor in the film. Steven Bauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Mary Elizabeth Mastratonio make the characters their own. It is easy to either like or despise the characters. Giorgio Moroder's score is simply breathtaking. As soon as I heard his score blast during the opening credits, I knew I was in for a ride. The cinematography by John A Alonzo is very unique; when a scene takes place during the day, it is bright, when it takes place at night, it is very dim. It seems that only natural lighting was used except for the indoor scenes, in which case the only lights present in the scene were used.

This is the perfect film for him to direct, and he did so with finesse. Oliver Stone's script is also excellent. The other aspects of editing, production design, costumes, and even sound are sublime.

What people don't know is some of the things in the movie is true other then Newark being the highest place of car theft. In the end when the news dispatch about the van with midget in being shot n two people being killed was true. Well the pregnant teen being shot and killed what's crazy is things like showing true action makes this movie one that keeps your eyes glued on the screen and not want to miss any part. This movie is great and is a must see.

It is impossible to be scared despite the desperate attempts to build up the suspense, as at every moment, the viewer is bombarded by the ridiculous. From the start, the violent death of Mel Gibson's wife is portrayed with more comedy than horror, as she is pinioned between a truck and a tree and with her dying words, begins seemingly to ramble incoherently, including the words Swing away. As crop circles and aliens (cartoon-style aliens) take over the neighbourhood, the son finds a textbook which seems to somehow predict the whole episode. At last the aliens begin to retreat, for some as-yet-unknown reason, but Mel and his family have a last battle to fight in their home. The alien attempts to kill Mel's child but _fortunately_ he has an asthma attack at that very moment (wouldn't you know it) so does not breathe in the toxic fumes and therefore survives (restoring Mel's faith, which had been sadly lost by the death of his wife). Meanwhile the words of Mel's dying wife are recalled, and Merrill swings away, splashing the alien with water and thereby killing it (very Wizard of Oz). Absolutely ludicrous from start to finish - I rarely feel upon exiting a cinema that I have wasted valuable time from my life, but this was one such occasion.

In a shed outback he finds a cute little dollhouse designed just like the famous Amityville, NY abode. How this got here or who built it is never explained. This is no Barbie Dream House though as this dollhouse crushes Bill's gift bike for his daughter's birthday and the parents resort to the this should make a great gift routine. The eighth and final Amityville flick before they did the remake. After part 3, the producers felt they could circumvent the whole Amityville house thing by having various possessed items from the house be the gateway to terror. So we had a lamp (AMITYVILLE THE EVIL ESCAPES), a confessional (THE AMITYVILLE CURSE), a clock (AMITYVILLE IT'S ABOUT TIME) and a mirror (AMITYVILLE A NEW GENERATION). So I guess a dollhouse isn't that ridiculous. This is actually a two-for-one deal as we get a possessed recycled fireplace too (there is general confusion as the house was built on foundation of an old house that blew up to suggest it was the Amityville house, but this is clearly set in California). I'm just glad they stopped with this one or we would have ended up with the likes of possessed toaster in AMITYVILLE YOU'RE TOAST. Or an evil stove in AMITYVILLE YOUR BLOOD BOILS. One thing this sequel does that is surprising is bring back the taboo sex angle from part 2, along they play it a bit safer with the stepmom lusting for the stepson. Other than that, it is pretty routine stuff with the occasional cool effect here and there (like the progressively rotting dad who haunts his young son a la John Landis' werewolf classic).
