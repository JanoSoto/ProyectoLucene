Sure, we've had some giant disappointments (Pearl Harbor, Planet of the Apes anyone?) but hey, 1999 had both Wild Wild West and Star Wars Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace in the same summer, so 2001 can hardly have that held against it. Then, there have been some highlights this summer as well. A Knight's Tale was some fun relief at the summer's opening, as well as Shrek, the ultimately hilarious CGI-film that surprised all who saw it, and then there was The Fast and the Furious, which can hardly be called an excellent film but was widely praised for its supercharged action sequences.With impressive summer movies already put on my shoulders, there was one film missing in my so-called repertoire... I had been waiting to see it all year long. It was Moulin Rouge, a musical, of all things, directed by the man responsible for the dance-masterpiece Strictly Ballroom and the bleak vision of society's association with William Shakespeare, 1996's Romeo + Juliet. With all the hype behind it, and the fact that it was a Baz Luhrmann film, AND the fact that I had been waiting all year to see it, I could not afford to be disappointed... and I wasn't. This fantastic film was all I expected and much, much, MUCH more!First, the story. Christian (Ewan McGregor) is a poor writer who deceives his father by moving to Montmartre, France, circa 1899. He has demenaged to this city of sin, hoping to indulge the four things he believes make life worth living truth, beauty, freedom and love. Once there, he moves into an apartment directly below the dwarvish French artist, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo, nothing short of hilarious in his diminutive role), who is conceiving a mass-production for the notorious nightclub across the street, the Moulin Rouge. Henri's problem his star and associate writer is a narcoleptic Argentinian (Jacek Koman). After the Argentinian falls asleep through the floor into Christian's room below, Toulouse-Lautrec commissions Christian to help them out in writing the production they call Spectacular Spectacular! Christian, seeing he has little choice in the matter, agrees to do so, and leaves an indelible impression upon Toulouse when Christian - dressed in Lederhosen and mounted above cardboard Swiss Alps - electrifies their creativity as he sings The hills are alive - with the sound of music! Toulouse and his compatriates feel it is time for Christian to propose the production to the nightclub's owner, Harold Zidler (a very flamboyant and eye-catching Jim Broadbent).Once Christian enters the Moulin Rouge, he is immediately captured by this nightclub of dreams. The can-canning ladies enter the room belting out Lady Marmalade with a background techno beat by Fatboy Slim, while at the same time the men seeking pleasure in these women burst into the room with their own, hyped-up, rousing version of Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit. This is a nightclub that would capture anyone, anyday, anytime, anywhere... even in our modern, shallow society that couldn't bare to get their money's worth with this masterpiece of a film.But anyway, on with the summary! In the midst of this frantic foray, the jewel of Christian's eye in this nightclub is the marvelously gorgeous Satine (Nicole Kidman). She stumbles into his life looking like Marilyn Monroe on a trapeze, all the while singing Monroe's own Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend. In a mysterious set of circumstances, Christian is arranged a meeting with this diva, and in turn captures her heart with his uncanny obsession with love and all he knows about it. This soon becomes a problem when the Duke of Worcestor (Richard Roxburgh) becomes aware. The Duke is the one whom Zidler turns to for investment in the nightclub. It is the Duke who will provide finances for Spectacular Spectacular!, but he'll only do it with a contract binding Satine's talents... and her body... to him. Christian and Satine, in turn, are forced to hide their love from the Duke so that the show can go on, Satine can be made into a star, and the two can go on, loving each other beyond time itself, happily... ever... after.Had enough? I've only scratched the surface in terms of what there remains to be seen in Moulin Rouge. This film, by all terms, is the perfect one for all who find their niche in the performing arts, whether it be music, acting, writing, or even loving itself. Conservatives, anal-retentives, and nitpickers I bid you beware... you'll be indulged by all that you may find to complain about with in the film. Perhaps Moulin Rouge is an allegory for Baz Luhrmann's true mission as a filmmaker. It seems to me that Baz Luhrmann is an ambassador of love for all who cease to understand it. Think about it a moment, all his films have the underlying subject of love (in Strictly Ballroom and Romeo + Juliet it's quite clear, not to mention this one), and in each one he ventures to present the power of love, the pain of love, and the ultimate outcome of it all. He ventures to present every angle of love, not to merely let people know that it is good, because in some cases he lets us know how painful it is. But in the end, we realize that Maestro Luhrmann's mission is to show all his audiences how to love again, and personally, I believe he's done a far better job here than James Cameron did with Titanic or, worse yet, Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer did with Pearl Harbor.Moulin Rouge is a film where there is something for everyone. For singers and music lovers, there are a million songs we have all grown to love (and, in some cases, loathe) over the years, including Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit, Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You, U2's Pride (In the Name of Love), Eden Ahbez' Nature Boy, (performed in this case by David Bowie), and the latter singer's Diamond Dogs and Heroes. (Ironically enough, David Bowie beautifully masters Ahbez' jazz classic Nature Boy, but he seems to have been kept as far away as possible from singing his own tunes.) For visual-seekers, the production design, costumes, and cinematography are more than enough to satisfy your ravenous eyes.  For musical-lovers, there's plenty of reference to musicals past, so you'll definitely find something to identify with here. And, even for the sarcastic and edgy-humored, you'll find much to enjoy with parodies of Titanic and other sappy love stories of the past.Whew! I think I've said enough to praise this film. Satan be the name of those who try to discourage me from loving it so dearly. I give Moulin Rouge 4 1\/2 stars on a five star scale.

Please!..Athos crying about his baby-boy?.. Come on!.. Telling d'Artagnian that he'll kill him???..

No movie better illustrates this principle, I  feel, than the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  I remember seeing this movie one night almost a decade ago and, despite being eighteen at the time, I felt like a scared little boy when it came time for me to go to bed a little later on.  (Before turning out the lights, I must have made at least half-a-dozen checks under my bed and everywhere else in my bedroom where it would be hypothetically possible to hide an alien seed pod.)  I just couldn't help it; Invasion of the Body Snatchers is an incredibly unnerving film.  Although the only remotely alien-looking things that appear in it are the seed pods, there is something unbelievably chilling about seeing once-normal human beings suddenly transformed into emotionless clones, and the fact that the victims of the pods are all snatched in their sleep certainly doesn't make it any easier to go to bed after watching this movie.  Particularly creepy moments in the film, I felt, were that scene where the incomplete clone adopted the same injury that the original had acquired after cutting his hand, and that scene where the hero and his female companion looked in that house and saw one of the people in it about to stick a pod under the baby's bed.If you want to be a real prick, find someone who is easily scared and make them watch this movie (preferably at night).  Then, while they are doing this, get half-a-dozen or so papier-mache pods (that you had the foresight to make earlier, of course), and stick them under the victim's bed, in their closet, and anywhere else that you can think of.  The results should prove most interesting.

He doesn't let a small detail that he is not of noble blood deter him - he just gets a naked Jeffrey Chaucer (don't ask) to forge some documents for him and voila!, he is a Knight!And it wouldn't be a proper film for our boy if he didn't get to romance and bed a lovely lady along the way would it?You know you are in for a rocky ride within the first two minutes; not only is the theme tune for the first jousting match Queen's 'We Will Rock You' - but the entire crowd and participants of the tournament are bashing their hands and chanting along with the music!  A later scene involving dancing bizarrely morphs into a dirty dancing romp set to David Bowie's 'Golden Years'.All the characters are basically time travellers from the modern day plonked in the past - they have all the modern mannerisms that just did not exist back then (witness the line It's called a lance... Hello? that features in the trailer prominently).  This wouldn't be so bad if the movie settled on a style and stuck to it; it veers from comedy to drama to romance and back to comedy again over its unwelcome length of close to 2 hours.And nobody appeared to have briefed Rufus Sewwell that he was to play it for laughs - his seriousness throughout the entire film is a testament to his acting ability.  Or perhaps it was too late by the time he realised what sort of film he was in and he decided to 'grin and bear it'.Alan Tudyk and Mark Addy provide the only constant throughout the entire film - they are under no illusions of being any more than comic relief and the modern anchors for the audience to cling to.  Paul Bettany as 'Geoff' Chaucer is pretty good - but he doesn't get much to do after his initial introduction.The movie works best when it decides to go for the true drama of the situation - Heath's dilemma in the closing 15 minutes; his reuniting with his father, and his battle with the future King of England.  It descends into self parody and anarchy for the remainder.The romantic interest is distracting and quite frankly boring - the only mildly attractive lady plays hard to get for so long you wonder why Heath kept pursuing her.I wouldn't want to create the impression that I didn't like this film - there is plenty to chuckle at - but the fact I was chuckling rather than being given a good jousting film was a bit of a let down.  The jousting scenes themselves are pretty good and well staged, but the sets themselves seem very small - surely jousting competitions were held over a larger area than what is portrayed?All in all 'A Knights Tale's is reasonably entertaining fare that will certainly appeal to its target audience as long as they are not too put off by the modern touches in what is primarily a period piece.  6 out of 10.
