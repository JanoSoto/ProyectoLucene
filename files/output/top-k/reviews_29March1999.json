No sooner does a film that is popular with critics, audiences, or both, than comes a knee-jerk instinct for someone to say, If other people like it, or love it, this must stink!  I'm not denying there were people who honestly didn't like this, but if there's one trend I'd like to see disappear, it's the backlash syndrome.Anyway, I thought this film was terrific.  First, it looked stunning, and director Anthony Minghella gave each story a distinct look, from the browns and whites of the desert, and the past love affair between Almasy and Catherine, to the rainbow like colors of Italy, and the story of Hana taking care of the mysterious English Patient.  As big a fan as I am of dialogue scenes, what I remember from this movie is some of the images, especially the scene with Hana looking at wall murals while going up and down on a rope line.  Second, he takes the story of the novel (which I liked) and makes it more accessible without losing the essentially elliptic tone.  So the two stories - Almasy and Catherine, Hana and Kip(and, essentially, ghosts) - come together without being sentimental.  Lastly, the performances.  Like their stories, Kristin Scott Thomas and Juliette Binoche create two different women, one cool on the outside and passionate on the inside, the other vice versa.  Like one critic pointed out, it's like both are joined together in Almasy's mind, since they're two sides of the same coin.  And Ralph Fiennes continues his string of excellent performances, being caustic and remote while hiding a deep and smoldering love for Catherine, and then turning around and being fatalistic and witty to comfort Hana.  This was my favorite film of 1996, and it stands that way, no matter what the backlash crowd feels.

It's amazing, but this type of film often seems to forget that it's supposed to be a comedy.  The comedy comes in varied styles too, from razor sharp dialogue to full-blown slapstick.Secondly, the film is tremendously romantic.  When Abby finally gets her man, it's wonderfully satisfying.  I think the main reason for this is because Abby is a person that most people can relate to.  She's not the Julia Roberts\/Michelle Pfeiffer\/Sandra Bullock mega babe that could get any man she wanted.  She's a normal woman, with normal fears and insecurities just looking for a normal relationship.The third reason this film stands out is its wonderful leading ladies. Abby must have been written with Janeane Garafalo in mind.  She is superb, a natural comedian with biting wit and surprisingly effective at the emotional moments in the film.  Uma Thurman is the perfect foil as dim witted Noelle. It would have been easy for Thurman to play the stereo-typical 'dumb blonde' (ala Romy and Michelle) but she plays Noelle with complete sincerity, comfortably ditching her cool, sophisticated reputation.  The relationship and growing friendship between Abby and Noelle is perhaps the most pleasing element of the movie.The last reason this film stands out is it's message.  This film would have been a joy without a point, but it has one anyway.  It's not a new idea and it's not particuly subtle in the way it's presented, but there's no harm in being reminded of it in such a pleasing way.If the film has its weak points, it's only in comparison with its strong ones.  Ben Chaplin doesn't really create a strong enough impression opposite Garafalo and Thurman, but there is nothing inherently wrong with his performance, he's just outshined. The film also stretches credibility to breaking point if you stop and think about it, so it's best not to do that.You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll go away happy.  This is a film I wholeheartedly recommend.

You get all the elements that work against our unlikely hero, such as a tough father and skeptical friends, as well as some unexpected advantages, like a helpful teacher and a resident genius friend.  The movie stumbles through these situations and banks that the audience will buy it because it is based on a true story.  And it seems like it has worked because most viewers seem to like the film.There were some fine elements in the film. Chris Cooper is Hollywood's most underrated actor.  His performance as the father could have been very flat, but instead he allows him to be a three dimensional man.  The development of the relationship between the father and son is nice, if not a little Freudian.  The other performances are nice too, but nothing special.  Laura Dern, another underrated performer, is given a terrible, underwritten role, but she does the best she can.  Also, the film does end much better than it begins.  The first 75 minutes have a lot of silly setpieces, like let's play on the train tracks like in Stand By Me and let's find our lost rocket even if the relevance to the plot is no longer clear.  The end of the film really comes together, though, by focusing on the father-son relationship and the futures of the boys once they get out of that dreadful town.One final note is in order.  I believe that the film was completely unfair to unions and intentionally tried to make them look evil.  Why is everyone associated with the union leadership portrayed like a wild, snarling animal? Could it be that the entire film is a quiet piece of right-wing propaganda? Does anybody really believe that if we just follow our dreams that everyone has an equal chance in America?

A brilliant plot and cast makes the film one of the best I have seen in a long long time. This unusual love story, which involves two very special people. Love comes in all shapes, sizes, and in this movie intellect. Juliette Lewis deserves an award for her performance because she was so convincing in her role as Carla Tate. It is as if she had played this role before in another movie because everything seemed perfect from the talk to the body language. Also, Giovanni Ribisi does a good job as Carla's boyfriend, Daniel. I love the storyline, finally a movie about a love story of a different kind, possibly unique in the fact that this is the only movie to be made. The one thing Carla desperately wants is the one thing she is fighting with her mother about, and that is independence and the freedom to do what she wants. Carla wants to feel like she do everything on her own instead of relying on dear old mom to do everything for her. Tom Skerrit plays Carla's supportive father; I applaud Tom Skerrit for his performance because it is usually the mother who supports their child and the father doesn't wants to budge from their opinions. Diane Keaton plays her domineering and overprotective mother, unwillingly to listen to anyone but herself. There is a lot of heart-felt and touching dialogue that takes on a deep meaning between Carla and her mother, especially toward the end of the film. She has to deal with her two other daughters before moving ahead. It is as if there are three themes rolled into one movie; amazingly, they all tie in with one another in one way or the other. I had a tear in my eye at one point in the movie because it was so touching. Anyone and everyone will enjoy this film from beginning up to and including the very end; I highly recommend The Other Sister. I would ask everyone to see this movie because Juliette Lewis gives a remarkable, Oscar worthy performance.

And Clint-- keep that shirt on. There was a clear tension throughout the audience during that entire scene.Many of the plot contrivances are good ideas, but don't come off entirely. For example, the hours Eastwood's character (Everett) fritters away before really becoming involved in the case (not knowing that these could be vital hours in saving Beechum's life) SEEM like they're meant to build tension-- but they just don't really. The relationship between James Woods and Eastwood is good-- I liked the way Woods respected Eastwood-- but Woods' one-liners came close to undermining his character and making him a stand-up comic inexplicably in the midst of the story. Finally, the crucial tension that SHOULD have existed when Everett has given up, and suddenly receives the clue that will tie the case together, just doesn't work. The climactic scene is played well, and is affecting, but I wish I could say the same for the whole film.Eastwood can be commended for taking the road of subtlety through the film, but what the film needs is a little more focus of tone and theme. The screenplay is wildly disjointed, and as a result the film is still struggling to establish a tone well into the second half.The performances are uniformly good, though often overwritten. The worst example of this, aside from Woods' overcomedic turn, is Eastwood's LONG speech about what a badass he is, during his 15-minute interview with Beechum.

The sensitive direction brings out the middle class character relationships with insight and feeling. It's quite informative to see a film set in this blue collar environment of today's England. As in so my foreign films nowadays, the influence of America is forever present in people's lives and culture.

Jackson, and Kevin Spacey, at first the two seem to be an unlikely couple.  It seems that Mr Jackson is more of an action\/comedy man, while Mr Spacey appears more likely to star in a serious comedy, or serious drama, where you must use every extent of your brain to understand every extent of the film.  That is what makes The Negotiator work so well. Jackson is not only the main character, but he gives us a breather when the conspiracy becomes too overwhelming to keep up with, whether it be making fun of the amateur negotiator Farley (Stephen Lee), or square dancing to cotton eye joe in a bar, 6 hours after rescuing a young girl from her father, early in the beginning of the film.  Jackson presents us with a fun, enthusiastic, rash (but wise) character.  While Spacey is the down to earth, I wanna do my job, family man, who doesn't trust, or choose sides.The young, but extremely talented, F. Gary Gray, does a phenomenal job, using an ominous office building, standing tall over the Chicago river, and then turning it all into the site of a superior motion picture.  Gray uses a wonderful contrast of Light\/Dark, High\/Low, Good\/Bad.  The good guys (Jackson), are higher up, on the well lit, 20th floor of a government office building. While the bad guys have set up a command center, on a dim construction barge in the river. Gray does a nice job of using action, drama, suspense, and even a little mystery, to make the film come together. There are never too many bullets flying, or too few tears running.  Trust plays a big part in the movie, representing how Danny Roman (Jackson) is like a caged rat, with the entire world against him.  Gray does a nice job of keeping the movie away from the Die Hard look, he uses only Flash Bang grenades, and no C4. Although Chris Sabian (Spacey) can be compared to Sargeant Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) of Die Hard and there are many similarities in the film, such as the office building itself, and the 500 trigger happy police officers, encroaching the surroundings of the building.Altogether, The Negotiator worked wonderfully. The excellent blend of blood\/sweat\/tears representing action\/suspense\/drama, along with a powerful musical score, and a superb cast.  The Negotiator keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the tip of your brain, for the entire 140 minutes  that it runs.

In its pure form, the sensuality of the characters' luscious gutter-french, and art direction beautiful enough to make your eyes cry blood tears, this is a visionary film you will never forget.
