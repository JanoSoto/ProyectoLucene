Sure the look of SWE1 is great, and the combination of THX in theatres with ILM's effects does occasionally blow your head back, and the film does deliver in most areas that a SciFi film should. This. however isn't just a SciFi film .... This is STAR WARS! And as a result it needs to deliver more than most of it's rivals.The commonly held flaw in this film is that it doesn't inspire the same 'awe' that the original trilogy did. Twenty years on the effects, though technically better do not seem as fantastic when measured against other effects laden extravaganzas that have been served up in recent years. (ID4) (Armageddon). The originals were made magnificent not only through their Special Effects, but the stories that supported them. It seems that where Star Wars set a benchmark, episode 1 fails to exceed.If this was the only flaw then so well and so good, but the script is without doubt another great failing. At times too anxious to involve story aspects that might play well with the die hards, while at other times pandering to the new wave of Scifi fans while disregarding the purity of original continuity, this seems sketchy all too often. This is one aspect of the film's undoing. In essence there is way too much of trying to please too everyone and managing too please (well) few.I have to admit though that this film is not without its plus points.

There is a need for a sustained contempt for a bad guy to carry through all the prequels (the references to senator Palatine are just too vague in the opening film and would mean nothing to anyone entering the star wars universe as a star wars virgin (so to speak). He was set up perfectly after killing Qui-Gon. It would have proved a great source of momentum for the films to follow.Jar Jar Binks... George Lucas .... What were you thinking????? (enough said)Padme... In attempt too pacify (or attract) the female audience... our queen much too easily becomes an action hero.

And when other more deprecable characters come into the picture (as the fear-love teacher), and you are supposed to side against her, it's not that easy, because in order to do that you should side with Donnie Darko.Another problem is that the film - and I don't know why - has become a cult.

Can we see dreams, believing them to be real? And if so, can we awake in a dream to figure out, that all around us is just an illusion, cleverly constructed by our sub conscious?Those couple questions sprung in my mind after I watched Vanilla Sky. It's rather interesting movie really, but it does have very poorly written and boring beginning as a romantic drama starring Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. Story it self turns good after the car crash. Then it really starts to examine reality if David Aames (Tomi Cruise), who gets his face mashed up, but who still manages to find love of Sofia Serrano (Cruz).Cruz is great as she always is. You just gotta love that accent. Other actress deserving praise is Cameron Diaz, who play Julianne Gianni, a occasional lady friend of David. She was amazing in that part.

Wilson and Barbara Broccoli decided that they would try a more realistic and character-driven piece for their next film, The World Is Not Enough. Hired to direct the movie was Michael Apted, who they hoped could merge a complicated story with action and deep character. While two aspects more or less worked, the action never quite gels with the rest of the film and what we get as a final payoff isn't as interesting as the beginning sets it up to be.The World Is Not Enough gets off to a fantastic start, this much is almost unanimous. Even though it's the longest, this fifteen-minute section of the movie is expertly handled and edited, probably being the best pre-title scene out of the whole series. After escaping from a Spanish bank, Bond (played again by Pierce Brosnan) brings in a briefcase full of money belonging to Sir Robert King, an oil magnate. Unfortunately, the money is booby-trapped and King is killed in an explosion at MI6's HQ.This leads Bond on a wild boat chase on the Thames that ends in a surprising plot twist. Then we're treated to the best Bond title song in a long time, performed by Garbage. After that, well... Not to say that the rest of the movie isn't as good, but it's not as fun. While we get a fresh and unique plot device introduced into the world of Bond, oil, it's used as just that a plot device (to be fair, most films in the series have the same problem).The action scenes in TWINE are easily the biggest cracks in the movie. Aside from the thrilling start, they suffer with the problem of not being as interesting as they probably were on paper. The ski chase is the most glaring example of this. And though they add to the plot for the most part, they seem superfluous. Take the attack on the caviar factory. Couldn't the bad guys just have sent normal assassins instead of those unwieldy helicopters?Making up for the lackluster action are the characters and overall plot. Elekra King, the daughter of Sir Robert, is one of the best developed people in the series, and Sophie Marceau plays her with the right mix of seductive innocence and toughness. She's made even better when we find out that she's in fact the villain and has been playing everyone to just nuke Istanbul and receive a massive oil monopoly. Judi Dench's M gets involved in the action, and because she's been in the past two movies and shows some genuine competence, I can say that she is a great boss.Returning from GoldenEye is Robbie Coltrane as Valentin Zukovsky, being even better here than in his previous appearance. He gets the best lines of the film and helps the plot in numerous ways. His final fate is touching and we have the sense of really getting to know this man who's always stood on the line of an ally and villain. Then there's Brosnan, who gives a good, but not quite great, performance as 007. This version of Bond is fairly dark and conflicted, and the actor gets into that side pretty good, even though some scenes could've done with a retake, like when he confronts Elektra in Baku. He still gets one of the best scenes of all the movies, where he kills a woman in cold blood.Two performers struggle a bit, though. Robert Carlyle as terrorist Renard doesn't grab the audience's attention the way Marceau does, and the character manages to fade into the background after it's revealed who's behind everything, even though he still gets a few good scenes. The other Bond Girl, Denise Richards, isn't as awful as most people say she is. She gives in a fair effort as Christmas Jones, an inferior character when compared to Elektra, and her being a nuclear physicist doesn't score high on the believability charts.There are a few miscellaneous comments David Arnold's music isn't as good as it was for Tomorrow Never Dies, being a bit too techno in some scenes, but he still scores a few decent cues. The plot is refreshingly realistic, probably being the deepest of Brosnan's four films, and it still manages to be suitably complex. A nice nod to Fleming's novels comes from the title, which is Bond's family motto. A final touch comes from John Cleese as R, Q's assistant. This would be Desmond Llewelyn's last Bond film, and he's as great here as he was in From Russia With Love. Cleese is actually more of a distraction and doesn't come close to Llewelyn when he takes over the role.Overall, The World Is Not Enough, despite the best of intentions, just misses the mark and falls into the average category, when it could've been much more. The hard-edged thriller is sometimes unsuccessfully merged with more light-hearted gags, but I'll recommend the film if you can overlook the lesser aspects.

It's about my favorite character, it's got three really good villains, it could have been really ahead of its time. Sadly, it's more of it's time, and unlike its predecessor, it doesn't have the same scope or depth.SPOILER WARNING!!! It's hard to explain how using the crystals in the Fortress of Solitude, he can talk to his departed Kryptonian parents, but basically his mother, Lara, takes away his powers as a result of his wanting to be with Lois. When he steps into the chamber, it's a grotesque montage of different (unnecessary) effects. Later, when he goes to get his powers back, there's no explanation or condition as to what makes them change their minds (or, come to think of it, why he should let them take his powers away in the first place).It's bad enough that the opening scene is paced so slowly that we're just thankful that he gets there the same day (he should be able to get from the States to the Eiffel Tower quicker than that), when the film slows down to the more intimate scenes, it feels slow. Not as slow as the first Batman movie, but still slow. Margot Kidder and Christopher Reeve are great, but the Niagra Falls setting does little to add interest. When it moves to the Fortress, it's a little better, but then it takes us to the scene where he gives up his powers, which leads to an unnecessary scene showing them in bed. It doesn't show any nudity and isn't raunchy or anything, but nothing happens and it might make kids uncomfortable.The villains in this movie are pretty cool. Gene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor, but quickly jettisons his bumbling team of goof balls. The three kryptonian bad guys give powerful performances. Terence Stamp and Sarah Douglass are authoritative while sadistic, and Jack O'Halloran is threatening as NON, the big one. Lacking dialog (per his request) he does a great job of conveying his emotions with facial expressions. Anyway, SPOILER WARNING, when they take over Washington, it's a good scene. It's how all of the scenes show have been. Sarah Douglass tosses people around like paper. I think it's safe to say that that was probably a Donner scene.As for the special effects, there's a scene where the three bad guys take over a town in Texas. It's okay, but there's a scene in which Zod deflects a flame thrower with his super breath. It's glaringly fake. There are other less-than-convincing F\/X elsewhere (but there are also some good ones). Plus, as is common in some Superman vehicles, the powers are inconsistent. Zod appears to have telekinesis a power Superman never demonstrated. The Fortress scene shows them teleporting, as well. And then there's what Superman does to make Lois forget that he's really Clark Kent. Finally, the climax in Time Square is far too choreographed. Moreover, the civilians in the city don't seem particularly scared of what's going on. They almost look like Superman and his enemies are putting on a show for them. This is gonna be good, says one guy. Man, Superman didn't do nothing', says a kid.When the first Superman film was released on DVD, I thought, here we go. It was given the treatment it deserved. I thought this might be re-cut and have documentaries and stuff like the first one. No such luck.

When it moves to the Fortress, it's a little better, but then it takes us to the scene where he gives up his powers, which leads to an unnecessary scene showing them in bed. It doesn't show any nudity and isn't raunchy or anything, but nothing happens and it might make kids uncomfortable.The villains in this movie are pretty cool. Gene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor, but quickly jettisons his bumbling team of goof balls. The three kryptonian bad guys give powerful performances. Terence Stamp and Sarah Douglass are authoritative while sadistic, and Jack O'Halloran is threatening as NON, the big one. Lacking dialog (per his request) he does a great job of conveying his emotions with facial expressions. Anyway, SPOILER WARNING, when they take over Washington, it's a good scene. It's how all of the scenes show have been. Sarah Douglass tosses people around like paper. I think it's safe to say that that was probably a Donner scene.As for the special effects, there's a scene where the three bad guys take over a town in Texas. It's okay, but there's a scene in which Zod deflects a flame thrower with his super breath. It's glaringly fake. There are other less-than-convincing F\/X elsewhere (but there are also some good ones). Plus, as is common in some Superman vehicles, the powers are inconsistent. Zod appears to have telekinesis a power Superman never demonstrated. The Fortress scene shows them teleporting, as well. And then there's what Superman does to make Lois forget that he's really Clark Kent. Finally, the climax in Time Square is far too choreographed. Moreover, the civilians in the city don't seem particularly scared of what's going on. They almost look like Superman and his enemies are putting on a show for them. This is gonna be good, says one guy. Man, Superman didn't do nothing', says a kid.When the first Superman film was released on DVD, I thought, here we go. It was given the treatment it deserved. I thought this might be re-cut and have documentaries and stuff like the first one. No such luck. As if it were one of the first DVDs ever released, all it has is chapter selection, optional subtitles, a cast & crew thing, and a (pretty cool) trailer. It's not without its audience, but unlike the first one, it lacks that universal appeal.

It isn't that this movie is necessarily bad for your health, but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie. You can count the number of pages by Anne Rice that I've read on one hand, but after seeing this movie and Interview with a Vampire, I get the feeling that she writes really good novels. The plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history.Still, Stuart Townsend's voice-over narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than Brad Pitt's vampire narrative ever did, and you can tell that QUEEN OF THE DAMNED's limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the Anne Rice storyline. While Interview decided to go with lace and elegance, QUEEN relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously. One can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places. The costumes and rock & roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack.However, I'll give credit where credit is due. The soundtrack is excellent. Korn and Disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like Butthead.The film opens with a very cool Goth-rock zoom & splice montage, but after the first ten minutes or so, the directing degenerates quickly. It's as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn't enough time and enough money to do an Anne Rice novel justice. What results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects. Unfortunately, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED fails to do the genre justice just as its John Carpenter counterparts fail to impress. Where are the yellow contacts? Where's the pale blue make-up?

It shows in merely 2 hours in a beautiful way things of life in a uncomplicated uncensored way. It is like making a movie without telling anyone that you are doing so ... It shows what many of us keep to ourselves. The thoughts for which we are ashame, the feelings we dear not to expose... And then Lester decides to live the life to its fullness. I guess there is a message in the movie which invites us to try to see the beauty in life in all aspects; the good and bad ones. For there are always positive sides to find in every experience of life. We are (as I see it) controlling too much our lives and in doing so we forget to live.

I remember seeing this when i was 5 years old from then on it has been my all time favorite Dirty Harry Movie. I can see why Clint is such a legend, his performance as Harry Callahan was very very strong you can see it, he doesn't say very much but you can see it in his face and in the tone of his voice when he speaks. This film is the original action cop movie no wonder it has been so popular with everyone. Fantastic direction by the legendary Don Seigal. Fantastic performance by Andy Robinson who plays Scorpio,to be honest he actually scared the crap out of me, his performance was that strong and that laugh of his, it makes my head stand up.The whole film was AWESOME!!! It has everything you would want in a action classic movie. I give Clint Eastwood a lot of praise for his outstanding work i never grow tired of him This movie is simply THE BEST!!!

I don't agree with the pundits who say it is too slow. The negotiation part of the film, was an integral part of the film. We needed this, to understand the mentality of the hostage takers. Where I think it could have been improved, was to have had the leader of the guerrillas portrayed as a stronger Castro type of character, possibly discussing the rights and wrongs of his actions with Bowman, who seemed to be an altruistic type person. I loved the scenes in the Colombian jungle \/ mountain areas. Every time the film cut to these scenes, I felt as though I was there. The interaction of Bowman and his captors was riveting. Even the interaction of the captors and their leaders was great. I loved the indiscipline of the captors, especially the scene where the main captor went crazy after a night on the cocoa, and shot his own man in the leg. He didn't face a court martial, but an instant decision, downgraded to look after the pigs. Great stuff. David Morse's performance as Peter Bowman, an every day guy stuck in the midst of this hostage game was brilliant. The way he was transformed into a mud spattered , beard growing wreck, trying to keep his sanity, by remembering his wife and lost child, knowing that he was just a pawn in the game, who could be shot at any time. I think that he, more than Crowe is the reason that this is a good film. Like most good films it establishes the character of the protagonists early in the film. We see how good Terry Thorn (Crowe) is at his job of hostage negotiator, with the ability to turn into a Jim McClain Character. Bowman is being **** on from a great height by his employers, and his wife (Meg Ryan) is feeling the strain of being dragged around the world to follow her husband's job, possibly more than just her husband. I can't understand why the director \/ writers didn't allow Thorn and Alice to get it together. After all he was a red blooded male, who didn't appear to be getting much prior to their meeting. She was a frustrated wife who's husband had been neglecting her for his job. They were thrown together for a very long time. This might have established the fact that Thorn wasn't the perfect English gentleman, and allowed us to think he might have second thoughts about bringing Bowman back. The final Rambo type scenes are done really well, with all the discipline of an S.A.S raid. Not a great film but a good almost very good film. I don't know why Alun Armstrong was in this film. Meg looked gorgeous in this film.

Liv (Paltrow) meets her dad Ricky (Lewis) for the first time at her mother's funeral. Ricky is a karaoke hustler, a guy who walks into various competitions and not only wins the cash prize, but manages to get a sucker to bet on which of them is going to win. Ricky reluctantly lets Liv tag along with him on the circuit, and along with singing herself, she also tries to forge a relationship with her father. Todd (Giamatti) is a salesman who travels most of the year and comes home to a house where his children don't talk to him and his wife would rather spend time online than talk to him after one of his business trips. One day he has a moment of clarity and decides to use some of the 800,000 frequent flier miles he has racked up, taking off in his car and driving anywhere but near his home. The first night he gets a room, he walks into a hotel bar and is convinced to get up on stage for their karaoke night, where he finds he loves the freedom it allows and the attention it garners him. Along the way on his trek, he picks up a hitchhiker named Reggie (Braugher) a recent parolee with the voice of an angel, and the two strike up a very close friendship despite (or possibly because of) their many differences. Finally, there is Suzi (Bello), a drifter who travels her way to karaoke contests by eschewing all dignity and selling any part of her she can. At a stopover in Cincinnati, she encounters Billy (Speedman) a former seminary student who is now a gypsy cab driver that just discovered his girlfriend sleeping with his business partner. Bello convinces him to take her to California, but along the way, the lure of the $5,000 purse in Omaha gets the best of her and they make a stop there.Duets features several story lines, but other than karaoke, they all have one thing in common They are all unhappy with either their past, their present or the prospect of a bleak or uncertain future. The film really isn't all that good, but there are a couple of good things about it. First and foremost, the chemistry between Giamatti and Braugher is fantastic. Completely casting aside the fact that they are two of my favorite actors, their connection was practically tangible. Hey, who knew Giamatti could sing, too? The rest of the stories were pretty clichéd or just not very compelling at all. I wasn't sure where they were trying to go with the Suzi\/Billy arc but it ended up going nowhere for me personally. Huey Lewis, nothing more than a marginally average actor does an okay job in this film, but it obviously isn't much of a stretch for him.If you are not a fan of any of the actors, Duets is entertaining enough to sit through and not end up hating yourself afterward. Personally, the film deserves a slight edge because of the Giamatti\/Braugher thing, but altogether, it gets a 6\/10. In this case I'm rounding up from 5.5 for that edge.--Shelly ","genre":null},{"date":"13 March 2005","score":"11 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" Bruce Paltrow's film Duets basically centers on the relationships of vastly different people who all end up at a karaoke contest in Omaha.
