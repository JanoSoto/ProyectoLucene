I absolutely loved those films. Then when I was 8, I froze at the news I was given. The Star Wars saga was being continued.Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace, this is the only one of George Lucas' science-fiction fantasy masterpiece series that I did not see at the cinema, so I had to wait for it to come out on video. It was well worth the wait.The film goes back thirty two years before Episode 4, back to the beginning of the end for the Old Republic. The tranquil planet of Naboo is threatened by the greedy members of the Trade Federation, who have recently been angered by the Republic increasing the taxation of trade routes. They are secretly backed by the scheming Sith Lord Darth Sidious, the future ruler of the Galactic Empire. Two Jedi Knights are sent to intervene.The events of the film are then set into motion when Sidious orders the Federation leaders to kill the two Jedi and invade Naboo to force its democratically elected Queen to sign a treaty which would allow them to bypass the trade routes. The Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi escape to find the Queen and escort her to the Republic capital of Coruscant. To stop them, Sidious sends his apprentice Darth Maul to hunt them down.Many fans of the series believe that this installment is a weak one for its story and characters. I myself believe that is a mistake. It is the role of the Jedi to complete their missions with compassion and only interfering with planetary roles when necessary. As for the complaints about Anakin, the point of the way Jake Lloyd plays the role is that he is supposed to be an innocent child. He is not evil from the day he was born. With Padme\/Queen Amidala, yes she is only fourteen years old and has much to learn in the role of being a planetary representative, but she is sharp minded and ready to defend her people in any way she can. And finally, Jar Jar Binks. Many say he's horrible, but I say he is one of the most enjoyable characters I have ever seen on the big screen.The Phantom Menace tells the beginning of a film legacy and commences the rise Of Anakin Skywalker to becoming a Jedi and his subsequent fall to the dark side as Darth Vader. It is a fantastic opening to the best film series of all time, and I would not have had it any other way. If any of you believe me in this, then the Force is with you... always.

(Not even, I might add, the notorious Sofia Coppola; she's bad, but her performance is benefited by the character she's playing, which is also weak). So for a long time I was one of those guys going Hey, Godfather part III isn't as bad as everyone says. Sure, its not as good as the first two but not many movies are! Later in life, presumably with heightened standards and a better sense of criticism, I started to suspect that the opposite could be true - that part III was really nowhere near as good as I'd recall - and after seeing all three films pretty much back to back I have to be honest (an approach I think wouldn't hurt the more enthusiastic defenders of this film) and conclude that The Godfather Part III, despite certain qualities, simply doesn't work.(Excluded passage due to word limit; concerning how Coppola did the film for the money, and that it actually makes the film a little easier to appreciate)I think the film really, on a whole, is perhaps not 'bad', certainly not horrible, but definitely a failure. The plot is underdeveloped and not engaging - Michael Corleone suffers from guilt. Its not unreasonable to say he did that at the end of Part II already. Where does his search for redemption lead him? Do they really pull him in again? Does his character do or say anything really memorable? Once or twice. But the script really is a long filler-session. And while everybody seems to just automatically praise Pacino because, well, he's Pacino I don't think his performance in this film is particularly good either, at least not by his merits. He's a great actor, and this is as fine a performance as any other he's made, but when you consider how truly versatile Pacino can be (compare Godfather part II with Scarface, with Serpico, Devil's Advocate, you name it, he's right there in character) its a disappointment that the aged Michael Corleone has turned into... well, Al Pacino. Obviously the character is not the same man that he used to be, but I never once really believed that I was watching Michael Corleone. He looked, and acted, too much like Al Pacino.Not to mention Andy Garcia being nothing more than Andy Garcia, Joe Pantanglio, Eli Wallach, Talia Shire in a strangely awful performance (she's not a bad actress at all, but whatever happened here?). And of course Sofia Coppola; she isn't the crucial problem, but in the end she does become responsible for a lot of misfiring. The only one still doing a prime job is Diane Keaton as Kay - truly an unsung hero in these films, and to me one of the main reasons the drama work - and the film's best scenes were the one's she shared with Pacino. Why? Because then I felt like I was even watching a Godfather movie.Much of everything else simply doesn't work. Whereas the original films were subtle and ambiguous, part III filters the story with melodramatic punches that are un-inspired and obvious. Michael's son, played by Franc D'Ambrosio, seems taken from Days of Our Lives and so many of the questions we ask ourselves - what does he remember from his childhood? What does any of the characters feel about Michael's marriage in Sicily? Did Tom Hagen ever move to Las Vegas? etc - are left completely by the road, as if Coppola truly isn't interested in telling this story. There are instead near-insulting reminders to the audience that the other two movies still exist (like the pointless scene where Michael have kept the drawing Anthony left at his pillow when he was nine or so; I remember this he smiles, though I'm not sure if we are to understand this as I also remember they shot up the bedroom that same night; once again, it seems Coppola simply forgets his own story). There are also awkward attempts at creating dramatic highlights in line with the horse-head scene and that very shooting in the beginning of Part II, involving a shooting during a parade in Little Italy and a stupid and ugly scene involving a helicopter. Making a Godfather sequel formulaic is truly a depressing insult to the originality of the first two films. The attempts Coppola takes on the Vatican are also pretty flat when you think about how Italian cinema has been doing this for half a century.There's no reason to watch this film have you not seen the first two. And there's really no reason to watch it if you have seen them either. When you think about it, I don't see why the film's few merits are worth talking about. Movie newbies having seen Part I and II will naturally see III too, and I think many of them will come to the same conclusion. It's not all bad, but so what. It simply doesn't work very well.

Well I guess I can start by saying that it is the most action packed animated film I have ever seen! That's technically what this movie is. It's just 1hr and 20min of non-stop shooting, explosion, fighting,and adventure. Well of course there's more to the plot. The film opens with a giant planet named Unicron that looks like the Death Star eating another planet. Then it shifts to the Autobots who're about to lead a shuttle to search for more energon cubes. Unfortunately for them, The evil Decepticons raids their ship and kill all the members. This really got a lot of fans angry because they saw a lot of their favorite characters die 10 minutes into the movie. The only reason they killed so many characters is so they can add new characters and release more toys. They were taking a big risk killing off so many characters. Anyway, the Decepticons takes over the ship and they are spotted by the Autobot Hot Rod. Hot Rod and some other Autobots attacks the ship, and an all out battle rages. During the battle, Optimus Prime (the leader of the Autobots)confronts Megatron(the leader of the Decepticons). They engage in an all out battles that left all fans cheering because they waited so long to see these two rivals fight to the death. After a while, It seemed that Optimus won, but Megatron played a dirty trick and wounded Optimus pretty badly. But Optimus with all the strength he had left gave Megatron one last punch that left him crippled. The Decepticons escape, and optimus with his last breath, gave the Matrix and his leadership to Ultra Magnus. Mean while, an injured Megatron gets betrayed by his minion Starscream and gets pushed off into space. There, he meets Unicron who makes Megatron one of his minions. In exchange, he gives Megatron a new and more powerful body and rename him Galvatron. He also gives Megatron 3 robots named Relector. With his new power, he kills Starscream and takes over the decepticons again. Now Unicron is forcing him to kill the Autobots and destroy the All Sparks. Now the Autobots have to face Galvatron and Unicron at the same time. I'm not gonna spoil the rest because this is where the movie gets really good. I'm a casual fan of Transformers, and I must say, this film really impressed me. Some people hate it because it had to much violent action, some random music use, and there's to many references to Star Wars. Yes there is a whole bunch of action, but that's what's awesome about it. How many movies have you seen where something blows up every 5 seconds? Yeah, sometimes the action can be a little uneven, and the animation might be laggy from time to time, but this was made in the 80s so give it some slack. There are many references to Star Wars however. Like the character Hot rod is related to Luke, Unicron looks like the Death Star, Arcee has the princess Leah hairstyle, Optimus Prime talks to Hot Rod in his ghost form much like how Ben Kenobi talks to Luke. But i didn't really mind that. So many movies copied things from Star wars up to the point that you don't care anymore. As for the music however, it is completely random. Like when Hot Rod opens the Matrix and the song The Touch starts playing in the background. It also has the most random use of Weird Al Yankovic's Dare to be Stupid. They played that song when the Autobots where fighting some other random robots in some random planet. And after they made peace with those robots, they started dancing to the exact same song! Despite all these negative feature to this film, it's awesome and anyone will love it. I give it~3.5\/5 stars!

So, I decided to give it another shot, and once again was bitterly disappointed. No, it was not that I had high expectations, but rather it was because this film was actually rubbish.Blade is based on the marvel comic book of the same name as is about a 'daywalker' a half-vampire that has all of their strengths, but none of their weaknesses, with the exception of their thirst for blood. Blade (Wesley Snipes) was born after his mother had been bitten by a vampire but before she had turned, so she was still, partly at least, human. It is unclear what had happened to him between his birth and when he was found by Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) at the age of 13 and together they became a team of vampire hunters. The movie begins when a young man is being lured into a vampire nest to feed, and the man is rescued by Blade in his hunt for a renegade named Frost.Now, in this universe, the vampires are divided between the pure-bloods (those born vampires) and the turned (those who become vampires after they are bitten), and the hierarchy is set in that order. Then there are the familiars, those who sell themselves to the vampires in a hope that one day they will become vampires. As Blade explains to Karen, a haematologist that he rescues after she is attacked by the vampires that he is tracking, that they are a race that live apart from humanity and have a treaty with humans not to abuse their powers.However, there are those within the vampire ranks who desire to rule over the humans, Deacon Frost being one of them, and he is researching the ancient texts so that he might become the Blood God and thus turn the tide of the war between the humans and the vampires. However as it turns out the vampires are actually manipulating humanity from behind the scenes and ruling them from the shadows. As Blade explains, they control the police, but move from city to city keeping in the shadows.Now the question is why I did not like this film. Personally, it was really clichéd. Now, unfortunately, vampires in and of themselves are clichéd, and have been this way ever since Bram Stoker first wrote his story about vampires (Dracula). Now, don't get me wrong, Dracula is actually quite a good book, but in a sense it has been quite overdone, from the old silent classic Nosferatu, to the many copies that have appeared on the cinema screens ever since. However, Vampires are still quite popular (as can be seen with the Twilight novels and films which, to me, are rubbish). The problem is that once one sees something a vampire story that is really good, it sets a benchmark which makes it very difficult to exceed, and to me that turned out to be the role-playing game Vampire (of which I will not go into details here).Obviously in a film one does have a very limited space to be able to set the scene, but still, I feel that this film does fail on in a lot of areas, and if I were to label one scene, and that is where Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorf) appears in daylight and survives, namely because he is wearing sunblock. Seriously, that, to me, is rubbish. He simply should have burnt up like all of the other vampires that are exposed to sunlight.As this film came to the end it reminded me of a video game, namely it was a series of fight scenes interspersed by some cut scenes that help move the story along, and then, at the end, the hero fights the big bad guy, and wins. Video games have changed a lot since the days of space invaders, and are multi-million dollar productions in and of themselves. It seems that a lot of the action films follow the format of your average video games these days, though games tend to be a lot longer than your average movies, though I also know (and I have done it myself) that people will sit and watch others play these games.

I felt that there were parts that were supposed to be funny but seemed liked they were out of place.Starring as the awesome four in this film are Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson.

It had less clichés, had a few twists, some of which I didn't anticipate, and has Blade teaming up with the vampires to fight a third enemy, though whether this third enemy is an enemy of blade is a little unclear, however it does become evident that he does becomes Blade's enemy by the end of this film. Also, the movie was filmed on location in Prague, and not only have I been to Prague (though not for so long that I could say that I recognised some of the places) but it adds a bit more of the exotic feel to it.However, before I continue, we must remember that while vampires have existed throughout human history in one form or another (though I would not agree with those who say that vampires are one of those legends that appear to turn up in multiple cultures) Bram Stoker had his original vampire, Dracula, arise from this corner of Europe, though Transylvania happens to be in Romania and not the Czech Republic. So, while the first movie is set in Los Angeles (and I found it a but odd that a major vampire temple would be located in Los Angeles) this film goes back to where the vampire legend began (sort of).Basically the vampire world has been rocked by the appearance of a mutant vampire. The mutant, which the call the Reapers, feed on vampires, and turn vampires into Reapers. This, obviously, concerns the vampires as the Reapers have all of the strengths of the vampires, but their only weakness is a vulnerability to sunlight. Further, reapers that have been turned tend to be a lot more violent and a lot more dangerous. Further, the vampires use the threat that the Reapers have on humanity as a way of bringing Blade to assist them.In this film, Blade is tracking Whistler. It turns out that he was not killed in the last film, but rather has been turned into vampire. However, he is not running around like a vampire, but rather being constantly tortured. As vampires regenerate and age a lot slower than humans, it is easy to torture him to the point of death, and then come back a few days later for a bit more.Despite this film being substantially better than the previous film, Blade II is still not much of a film. I did enjoy it more, and getting rid of some hot shot young vampire and trading it with an ancient vampire as the bad guy made it a lot more enjoyable for me.

I always had some kind of sympathy for the shattered parts I had seen before and I was very hopeful for this film to get the theme right, as it was based on a story of C. Sagan.Well, now I am truly disappointed.Our main character is a strict scientist, more than most I have ever met personally. She is based deeply in the philosophy of modern natural science.

This is true and boy, did they go out with a bang!This is my review on The Creature From The Black LagoonNOTE I do NOT believe in millions of years or the evolution theory so I'm just leaving them bits out, just like I ignored it in the movie.The plot goes like this; Scientists find a fish like claw sticking out of a rock down a tributary of some river in South America. They are curious to know what could've owned this strange hand. One suspects that the rest of the skeleton might have been blown downstream. He and the rest of the scientists head downstream into unexplored territory- The black lagoon. during their research they find out that they are in the habitat of a fish-like monster. Out of all the universal monsters (Wolfman, Drackula etc) The creature is probably the most diverse. The story feels more like a sci fi than a horror and there are no haunted mansions, creepy graveyards or bleak dungeons. Instead, the movie takes place in a very dark lagoon. Lots of the movie takes place underwater. There are scenes were the scientists go diving for bits of rocks to compare with the skeleton (Don't ask me, I'm no scientist!) Also is shows some very interesting scenes of the monster darting through the water towards it's prey. These scenes are phenomenal for a 50s film and it is evidence that you don't need CGI for everything which films now-a-days seem to have. I personally haven't a clue on how they filmed all these scenes. It's hard to describe on a written review but when you watch the film you will no what I mean.The acting isn't top notch but it's OK. The main character aren't really that memorable, but they don't need to be! it's the monster you watch it for!For a 50s film, the monster looks rather frightening, certainly for younger viewers. Even I found some of the scenes quite creepy. The monster hunts down all the scientists who have been travelling into his lagoon on a bust-up old barge. It's interesting to watch the monster react to the humans as if he could understand them. The man the the suit needs an Oscar! Constantly in the film, no matter how many times the scientists try to stop the monster, it just keeps coming back for more. This chemistry never gets old for me and it's just a joy to see the many attempts of the creature.The final 10 minutes really tip the scale of this little gem. We've got underwater battles with the creature. We've got the creature kidnapping a damsel in distress. We've got a got pursuit with guns and...erm.. claws. The last scene is just worth it alone. They finally hunt the creature down and, unfortunately, kill it. For me, this was rather sad that a fantastic movie monster was killed of in it's first film. If you are like me, don't fret! There is 2 more movies to sink your teeth into however I have not got round to seeing them so Icannot say wither they are good or bad.All in all, probably one of the best universal monster classics with great monster, fantastic hunt, an under water battle and some of the best cinematography ever filmed.

The big problem it never delivered anything worth justifying the effort of watching.

It begins with an air of mystery (no dialogue for the first 4 minutes) and a teaser about some dark unknown truth about the main character, a philosophy professor; when she finally speaks, she muses about how an invisible person--the bearer of Plato's ring of Gyges--would probably be struggling to piece together the unusual events surrounding her life. We are repeatedly given hints of her guarded secret love-life (a lover's apartment which she is afraid to visit), her violent temper which she repeatedly warns people about, discussions of Plato, Kant, transcendentalism, anything & everything indicating that some substance would follow.I felt totally cheated upon slowly realizing that the protagonist is absolutely average, her life uneventful, and the only grand philosophical question attacked is whether she should kiss her friend's father. Boo. Note to filmmakers do NOT allude to Plato's ring of Gyges (several times) unless you plan to back it up! That's like opening a film with Beethoven's 7th Symphony, then turning the rest of the film into a campy scifi flick about sex in the 22nd century.

The difference being in Werckmeister the philosophy is profound, pervasive and relevant to the story and setting, and, though painfully slow at times, Werckmeister gives the audience a powerful thought to chew on after the credits roll.This is the third Rohmer film I've seen, and I think I have to conclude that he's not for me.

While it was realised many years from this review, I think this still may help some who are looking to watch old 'classic' films.Not that I find this worthy of the 'classic' title. Session 9 is a atmospheric psychological horror (though I use the term loosely) that takes place in a old Asylum that was abandoned in the 1980s. A group of Haz-Mat (the people who remove toxins from an old building) have taken up the task of clearing the building up in a record 1 week in order to collect a handsome $10,000 bonus at the end of it.

I would first like to say that I'm no stranger to 'psychological' thrillers and I do understand the story completely (in fact I saw the ending miles away), but I found that with this film, the all important 'twist' was rather mellow and not especially shocking - in fact it was rather predictable. The plot itself has very little substance, other than two mildly interesting back stories (mainly Caruso and Mullan's characters) and the brief main plot, the story had very little going for it. While the whole 'sessions' aspect of the film, which documents the memory resurface of a former patient at the asylum, could of been interesting, it felt rather irrelevant to the plot until the end. The acting itself was not bad with Mullan and Caruso holding up most of the cast to be honest, though Guilfoyle was interesting initially, it was short-lived (literally). All in all, I couldn't say that the acting was bad, if fact it was above par and I did really see the mental torment of some of the characters. However where the film really fails itself is the scare factor. Now, I do not see myself as a 'jump' scare type of watcher, I like atmosphere, I like the entire of something being there but not quite knowing whether it is. But I find, a balance of both works best, not a complete gore feast or 'cheap' scare film but not a film that solely relies on atmosphere. Because (in the case of this film) with the latter, you find a build up at the beginning that you (the viewer) begins to realise doesn't really go anywhere. Many reviewers talk about amazing atmosphere but I honestly didn't feel it, other than the odd scene (the lights one comes to mind) most of the film was shot in daylight and lacked any fear or adrenalin.While I didn't despise the film at the end, I didn't find it astonishing either. A good film if you're not sure what to watch. But if you're looking for more psychological, I would say Shutter Island and if you want more scare then go for a more 'jumpy' esque film.

It is about the relationship that is built between a man on death row and a nun, a person who is probably his only friend in the world. This movie shows us brilliantly the pain a man suffers when he knows that he is going to die and that he deserves that death. He tries everything to get out of what he deserves and I shall leave it to you to find out what happens.It is the relationship between the man on death row (Sean Penn), and the nun (Susan Sarandon) that really makes the movie what it is. In this movie we see a man who is hated by every person in society, everybody is calling for his blood. Yet as the movie unfolds we begin to see that this monster is in fact a human being, with real human feelings. The movie creates the murderer's humanity by showing us that he has a real family with real kinsfolk. We see the struggle that fought within the man as he tries to come to terms with what he has done and what is going to happen to him.The movie also develops the character of the nun as well. We see a character who is willing to love a man nobody else wants to. Her desire to open out the human side in him and is willing to forgive him even though he has committed extremely horrific crimes. We also see a character in the nun who is strong, standing up to persecution not only from society but also from the church. She knows that all the man needs is love and she is the only person in the world who is willing to give this man some love.This movie also shows us a very harsh and unforgiving society and this society is ours. We see people who will never forget the crimes that people commit and people who would rather kill somebody than to forgive him. We also see a society that is so much blinded by hate that they would prefer to see an innocent man put to death than find the real murderer. Not only is society so hostile towards these people, they are just as hostile to those who are related to or even associate with them.

LA Cop John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) is chasing his arch enemy, Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) and captures him. Unfortunately Phoenix manages to set him up for the involuntary manslaughter of thirty passengers from a hi-jacked bus. The police chief, who isn't impressed with Spartan's tactics, uses this as an opportunity to put him away, namely in deep freeze.The movie then shifts to 2032 and Simon Phoenix is brought out for parole, but he somehow knows the code to release him and he escapes. The world of 2032 is a very different place. It is a peaceful world with no crime and nothing bad. It is beautiful and tranquil, but boring. Then Simon Phoenix enters the scene and the police, who are only used to arresting people for swearing, do not know what to do. So they decide to release the only person who can catch him, Spartan.This movie is awesome, not only is it full of action, but there is a lot of ideas that one can draw out of it as well. This movie is essentially about rights, namely the rights to basically be a jerk (Dennis Leary stars as Egdar Friendly, the rebel against this perfect society). Everything on the outside seems perfect, but there is a hidden area of discontent, and that is why Phoenix is brought back, namely to remove this discontent. The ruler of this future, Doctor Raymond Cocteau (Nigel Hawthorne) has a plan where his vision of perfection comes to light. This is his vision and unfortunately he pushes it upon everybody else.On one level this seems to be an attack against the idea of heaven. Namely the place may be peaceful and everybody loves each other, but in reality is boring because everything that we think to be fun is no longer there. Sex is an excellent example, they discuss how rampant sex was one of the factors of the collapse of society and thus it has been outlawed. Unfortunately, this is not what the bible says Sex is not evil, but rather something created for husband and wife to enjoy. It is not inherently evil as alcohol or greasy foods are evil. If this is what people think heaven is going to be like then they are sorely mistaken. The future portrayed in Demolition Man is more likely what hell is going to be like. I highly doubt that heaven will be a place where everybodies favourite songs are advertising jingles.Thus let us look at what the depiction of this future really is. This depiction actually one man trying to create heaven on Earth. Everything is not going the way he wants it to so he brings in a rather nasty character, Simon Phoenix, to deal with it. Cocteau is in effect trying to play God but it is very clear he is not. He may have prevented Simon Phoenix from killing him, but he cannot control him. Cocteau wants control but with the rebels, led by Edgar Friendly, the control he wants really doesn't exist. In reality he could just ignore them and the rebels wouldn't do anything. Edgar Friendly says that he is not a leader, he just goes for food and people go with him. There is no way that he intends on taking power from Cocteau, but Cocteau's paranoia and desire for control brings everything down around him. His greed in the end destroys the society that he has created.The names of the main characters seem to give an idea to the part they play. John Spartan seems to be named after the Greek City State of warriors. Spartan is himself a warrior but also is constantly referred to has a barbarian. The differences between Athens and Sparta were vast, where Athens was the seat of culture, Sparta was a land dedicated to war. This is the same with John Spartan, for he is a marked contrast between the society of 2032 and himself.Simon Phoenix is the criminal and he even says that he has arisen from the ashes. The phoenix was a legendary Arabian bird that would die in a ball of flame and then arise from the ashes to live again. This is not only representative of Phoenix but crime in itself. In this world, no matter how much we try to suppress crime, or destroy it, our nature will always cause it to rise again in a new form.Lenlina Huxley (Sandra Bullock) is Spartan's partner and is possibly named after Huxley, the author of a Brave New World. I have never read this book myself and know little about it, but she is the first character we meet in this new society and we are introduced to the society through her. We enter as ignorant as John Spartan, and we follow John Spartan through the movie as Huxley teaches us about this new world.Finally there is Edgar Friendly. He is the leader of the rebels, or the scraps as Cocteau calls him. He is friendly as his name implies, but is not treated as such. The wasteland is feared and condemned by Cocteau and all that it stands for is slandered, but in reality it is not as bad as it is made out to be. Edgar Friendly seems to be the bad guy in this society but he is not. Truly he is friendly.

The police chief, who isn't impressed with Spartan's tactics, uses this as an opportunity to put him away, namely in deep freeze.The movie then shifts to 2032 and Simon Phoenix is brought out for parole, but he somehow knows the code to release him and he escapes. The world of 2032 is a very different place. It is a peaceful world with no crime and nothing bad. It is beautiful and tranquil, but boring. Then Simon Phoenix enters the scene and the police, who are only used to arresting people for swearing, do not know what to do. So they decide to release the only person who can catch him, Spartan.This movie is awesome, not only is it full of action, but there is a lot of ideas that one can draw out of it as well. This movie is essentially about rights, namely the rights to basically be a jerk (Dennis Leary stars as Egdar Friendly, the rebel against this perfect society). Everything on the outside seems perfect, but there is a hidden area of discontent, and that is why Phoenix is brought back, namely to remove this discontent. The ruler of this future, Doctor Raymond Cocteau (Nigel Hawthorne) has a plan where his vision of perfection comes to light. This is his vision and unfortunately he pushes it upon everybody else.On one level this seems to be an attack against the idea of heaven. Namely the place may be peaceful and everybody loves each other, but in reality is boring because everything that we think to be fun is no longer there. Sex is an excellent example, they discuss how rampant sex was one of the factors of the collapse of society and thus it has been outlawed. Unfortunately, this is not what the bible says Sex is not evil, but rather something created for husband and wife to enjoy. It is not inherently evil as alcohol or greasy foods are evil. If this is what people think heaven is going to be like then they are sorely mistaken. The future portrayed in Demolition Man is more likely what hell is going to be like. I highly doubt that heaven will be a place where everybodies favourite songs are advertising jingles.Thus let us look at what the depiction of this future really is. This depiction actually one man trying to create heaven on Earth. Everything is not going the way he wants it to so he brings in a rather nasty character, Simon Phoenix, to deal with it. Cocteau is in effect trying to play God but it is very clear he is not. He may have prevented Simon Phoenix from killing him, but he cannot control him. Cocteau wants control but with the rebels, led by Edgar Friendly, the control he wants really doesn't exist. In reality he could just ignore them and the rebels wouldn't do anything. Edgar Friendly says that he is not a leader, he just goes for food and people go with him. There is no way that he intends on taking power from Cocteau, but Cocteau's paranoia and desire for control brings everything down around him. His greed in the end destroys the society that he has created.The names of the main characters seem to give an idea to the part they play. John Spartan seems to be named after the Greek City State of warriors. Spartan is himself a warrior but also is constantly referred to has a barbarian. The differences between Athens and Sparta were vast, where Athens was the seat of culture, Sparta was a land dedicated to war. This is the same with John Spartan, for he is a marked contrast between the society of 2032 and himself.Simon Phoenix is the criminal and he even says that he has arisen from the ashes. The phoenix was a legendary Arabian bird that would die in a ball of flame and then arise from the ashes to live again. This is not only representative of Phoenix but crime in itself. In this world, no matter how much we try to suppress crime, or destroy it, our nature will always cause it to rise again in a new form.Lenlina Huxley (Sandra Bullock) is Spartan's partner and is possibly named after Huxley, the author of a Brave New World. I have never read this book myself and know little about it, but she is the first character we meet in this new society and we are introduced to the society through her. We enter as ignorant as John Spartan, and we follow John Spartan through the movie as Huxley teaches us about this new world.Finally there is Edgar Friendly. He is the leader of the rebels, or the scraps as Cocteau calls him. He is friendly as his name implies, but is not treated as such. The wasteland is feared and condemned by Cocteau and all that it stands for is slandered, but in reality it is not as bad as it is made out to be. Edgar Friendly seems to be the bad guy in this society but he is not. Truly he is friendly.
