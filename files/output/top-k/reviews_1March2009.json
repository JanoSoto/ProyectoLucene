[{"date":"1 March 2009","score":"","review":" 'Elizabeth' features some impressive performances all round, including a star-making turn by Cate Blanchett in the lead. Her performance alone makes the film well worth watching. The film is essentially a political thriller and there's lots of intrigue and double-crosses. The tone of the film is rather gritty and it is consistently absorbing, even if events seem a bit murky at times. Geoffrey Rush and Christopher Eccleston both excel. Joseph Fiennes is effective as Robert Dudley and his romance with Elizabeth is touching. The film is violent, and the conclusion feels a little rushed.

It's truly the role of a lifetime, played beautifully by Burt Lancaster, with his swoon-worthy good looks, big personality, and overflowing charm. He's a man that believes in the Bible but also in what that good old-time religion can do for him financially. When he sees the beautiful Sister Sharon (Simmons), he ingratiates himself into her traveling revival meetings and becomes very successful, though he comes up against a reporter (Arthur Kennedy) and a prostitute named Lulu (Shirley Jones) he knew way back when who has blackmail on her mind. Subtly, however, Elmer changes, finding humanity even he didn't know he had.Jean Simmons never received the recognition she deserved either for her acting ability or her beauty. Her major stardom, unfortunately, was at a time when the field was really overcrowded with the likes of megastars like Audrey Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor. She gives a wonderful performance as Sister Sharon, a true believer who sees through Gantry immediately - though she also knows how effective he will be - plus she falls in love with him. Arthur Kennedy, as always, is fantastic as the reporter Lefferts, who asks people to question if a revival meeting is religion or a circus side show. Shirley Jones shines in an atypical role for her - a small but an extremely showy one.The duality of the four characters - Gantry, Sister Sharon, Lulu and Lefferts - is what makes the novel great literature and the film, in the hands of fine actors and a good director, so interesting. Gantry is a drinker\/philanderer and preacher, Sharon is a devoted preacher but also a woman of deep feeling, Lulu is a prostitute who wants to bring down Gantry but loves him, and Lefferts is a cynic who has doubts about religion but can't help but admire Gantry and Sharon.A must see.
