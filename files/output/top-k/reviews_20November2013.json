But I just don't understand what's so good about it. American Psycho is basically a story about a man who goes on a rampage killing everyone for no apparent reason, apparently he is a sociopath, a psychopath, a man who has mood disorders or multiple personality disorder or something else which is never made clear. One time before killing he has a sudden change of heart and chooses not to kill. He just doesn't kill but completely mutilates the bodies of the victims and cuts them to pieces and displays them in his second house which he uses for most of killings.Now I enjoy stories about serial killers, and Bateman shares many of their antics and method of operations, which is a plus point for me, I have also read stories and articles about serial killers and investigations, and also watched movies like Silence of the Lambs and Se7en which were both fantastic mind you. But while those films were very violent they had a meaning behind the killings, in this films there is no excuse or reason for Bateman's actions other than he is mentally unstable. Perhaps some therapy sessions with a psychologist or psychiatrist could have been used to make all this seem clear and find out what is really in his head and what's going on in his mind. Many directors alter the stories in movies as compared to the book so why not? The main part which bothers me is the investigation part, Bateman kills so many people in the film but apparently the cops don't care about investigating the whereabouts, finding out what happened and find out who maybe involved, gather a list of suspects, perhaps try to find Bateman's house where many people went missing, other movies based on serial killers had this aspect but it is missing in American Psycho? It could have seriously made this film more fun to watch. Instead we have one detective who investigates the disappearance of Bateman's business rival but still finds nothing after his minor and very brief appearances.The cops in the climax come after Bateman in force and overpower forcing him to escape, take refuge and confess all killings to his lawyer, but the cops did not go after him because of all the murders but because he shot an old lady who saw him trying to kill a cat. Right!. Then we are left with a wonderful twist in the ending that the murders were all Bateman's imagination. Bateman's flat where he did the serial killing was empty up for sale and not even his, apparently he killed no one all this was in his head. Again the it was a dream concept used to get rid of the cop investigation aspect. The director of the film said that she did not want the people to think it was all Bateman's imagination, but honestly that is the only way to analyze the ending otherwise the ending makes no sense to me at all. No matter how you analyze the ending, dream or no dream the film's overall plot is boring and the ending is nothing we haven't seen before. One way or the other this movie will confuse the hell out of you to decide what is real and what is Bateman's imagination. Bateman's conversations with the investigator were they real? Was his assistant being in his flat real or not? Bateman attempting to attack that homosexual businessman in the toilet was that also real or all in his head? Seriously this movie messes with your head. Movies like the Usual Suspects and even Fight Club which follow a similar concept, made it all perfectly clear by the end.Other than Bateman's serial killing the movie is filled with a lot of boring dialogue which is too cliché and almost painful to sit through, that dialogue bores me out of my mind and is not even a contributing factor to any of his killings apart from one perhaps, when he kills a businessman. The Investigator and Bateman's conversations are also nothing special. Bateman also spills out random threats for no reason but the people pretend they did not hear him as if he did not say anything, which ends up looking stupid. Christian Bale's performance in the only saving grace of this film as he is really into the Bateman character and is given almost all the screen time, the other's are honestly nothing special and only there to fill a gap. Obviously if you enjoy tons of violence in films and the gore you will also find it as a high point, I don't, I am fine with violence but not only this is too much, there is no real meaning behind it all but the ending makes it all meaningless.

Usually with corny crap there is somewhat of a charm to them and have some kind of likability to them that you can laugh at. This is beyond pushing the boundaries. This is breaking the boundaries, it is that corny.The plot to this movie is that Batman and Robin are going to stop a man named Mr Freeze who can't live without the surroundings having a temperature of below 0 degrees. He steals diamonds and other stuff as well as getting his henchmen to sing I'm Mr White Christmas, I'm Mr Snow as well as him saying constant ice puns... Need I say more? Sadly I have to. Robin and Batman stop him but Robin also feels as if he has been held back by Batman and... You can pretty much replace all his dialogue with Hayden Christensen's from The Star Wars prequels and you'll have the same effect.We also find out a scientist who cares so much about the environment that even an environmental film would reject her as a scriptwriter is trying to fix the deeds of man. The other scientist working there is mad and presents to The Un-united Nations (I REALLY wish I was making this crap up) a new super soldier serum, which at this point you're glad they don't make a Captain America joke. They create Bane and the mad scientist kills the one who cares too much about the environment. She then returns as Poison Ivy, basically a plant girl.Alfred's niece also shows up and basically does nothing until the final act. Poison Ivy also shows up at some kind of charity drive where there's some kind of sexist auction where men bid for women to take them out on dates. Then there comes the infamous appearance of THE BAT CREDIT CARD. I'm sorry I don't even read the comics but from what I've seen Batman is a cool character so this is probably the most embarrassing thing in a superhero movie since...

Poison Ivy wants to do it with plants and Mr Freeze wants to do it with Ice... Yeah this is GODDAM IMPOSSIBLE! I know for a comic book movie there has to be some kind of suspension of disbelief but this is beyond pushing it. Anyway while this is going on Batman and Robin fight over Poison Ivy instead of... Oh gee I don't know ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING.This was considered the final nail in the coffin for comic book movies to a widespread audience until Spiderman came out in 2002. To be honest, I can see why. Not only does the plot not make any sense and it's so corny the characters from the Adam West show would find it so, but it's sad because I find Batman a cool character. So to see him have bat nipples, bat asses and bat groins is just... embarrassing. That's the best word to describe it embarrassing.If there was anything redeeming about this movie (and believe me THAT is hard to find) then I guess it would have to be Mr Freeze's back-story. His wife suffers from a rare disease and he puts her into cryogenic sleep until he finds a cure and due to an accident can't live below sub zero temperatures. That was a pretty good back-story. But that doesn't make up for his irritating Ice puns and other corny things in this movie such as the bat credit card.So if you want to see the most humiliating thing to happen to comic books since Superman 4 and probably stayed that way until Catwoman this movie is for you.

I was born in the mid-eighties, so I saw this film a couple of years after its release. It was on too late, so my older sisters had to tape it for me. They were even nice enough to pause the recording to cut out all the ads -)(People who grew up with DVD recorders and harddrives won't understand this)... I loved this film so much. Kevin was the coolest kid I could think of at the time, and I wanted to be like him more than anything in the world. I even used to play 'Home Alone' with my friends, and we would go around the house and attempt to 'set traps', all of them harmless and stupid, but it was awesome to us.I own Home Alone on VHS and DVD. I think I still have the recorded VHS tape that my sisters taped for me somewhere. I have watched the movie at least 40 times. I can't wait to have kids and show them this movie.

Yes, I've seen it countless times (Don't ask me why!) I know the dialog by heart. In all honesty, I hate this sequel. Director Dominique Othenin-Girard completely ruined the amazing direction that this series was heading in after Halloween 4, and has no creativity or resolve what so ever. There are so many problems with this movie that I don't even know where to begin, so this review might be a bit jumbled, but then again. My reviews are always jumbled. I realize you have to suspend major disbelief in horror movies, but it became ludicrous. How did Michael learn to swim? Did he take lessons during a day of leisure or something? The Myers house does not resemble the original one at all. It looks like a giant mansion for crying out loud. Michael Myers himself is boring in this one. His mask is by far the most mundane this series has ever had. It looks childish and not even remotely scary. It's not that Don Shanks was bad as Michael. They just made him boring to watch. Even the kills are boring; we get a gardening tool in the head, blood splashing, a pitchfork impaling (Admittedly well done) a dull hanging, and more. You want more? Well, you're getting it. What was up with those comedic cops? And why was there clown music? This isn't a horror\/comedy, this is HALLOWEEN! It was quite incongruent. For those unfamiliar with Halloween 6, the Man in Black storyline leads into the thorn storyline, and that's when the series went downhill. I always found this series so creepy, because Michael had no motivation for doing what he was. He was the definition of evil, and it was much scarier that way. Here he starts crying during a scene. Every time I see that, it makes me furious. If I wanted Michael to star in a soap opera, I'd watch The Young and the Restless. It ruins Michael's mystique. Another thing which alienates fellow hardcore Halloween fanatics is Rachel dying. It's not that she died. It's that she died as quickly as she did. Her send off is by being stabbed with scissors? Give me a break! Rachel is one of the most legendary characters in this series, and that's how you repay her? The score is boring and subdued compared to others in the series. I also found Jamie and Michael having a telepathic relationship, pointless. What was the point of it? But it doesn't end there. For some ungodly reason, Jamie has these uncontrollable convulsions, and has trouble speaking. It just feels like the director took everything about the Halloween franchise that was classical, and decided to take a giant crap all over it. I wouldn't be surprised. There was tension between Donald Pleasence and the director in this series. It shows in Donald Pleasence's performance. He looks very bored, and rambles incessantly like an incoherent drunk. Though, I must admit when he was screaming DIE, DIE, DIE, MICHEAEL, DIE! while clobbering Michael constantly with a big piece of lumber was very amusing, but he was pretty bad. Danielle Harris tries incredibly hard to overcome the stupidity of her character, and you know what? She actually pulls it off for the most part. It takes MAJOR talent to do that. She was good. I just wish her character wasn't so idiotic. Ellie Cornell is a trooper for agreeing to this crap. Jeffrey Landman is incredibly annoying as Billy. He can't act worth a lick, and his weird stutter did him no favors. Wendy Foxworth is a disgrace to this franchise. Tina is by far the worst character the Halloween franchise has ever had. There is not one redeeming quality about her. Everything she did was annoying, especially her Oh baby talk, and that giggle of hers. She also overdoes the hysterics big time! The first time I watched this I was begging for Tina to meet her demise. Rachel dies in the beginning, yet this woman gets to stick around for approximately an hour or so? It's a slap in the face to me. Tamara Glynn (Samantha) & Matthew Walker (Spitz) are nothing but sex crazed idiots who deserved to get killed off. When you hear Tamara's awful scream, or Walker's irritating laugh, you'll see what I mean. Jonathan Chapin's phony tough guy act as Mike was unbelievable, and I didn't buy it for a minute. He was nothing but a glorified pretty boy. Beau Starr returns as the sheriff, and is wasted. There is one suspenseful laundry chute scene, and a really cool opening, involving a pumpkin carving, but that's really about it as far as efficiency goes. Final Thoughts This one was rushed into production (Foolishly at that) when Halloween IV was a hit, and it shows. They should have taken their time, in lieu of creating this abomination. Halloween IV set up a potentially new direction, which would have had Jamie taking over for Michael as the killer. That would have been awesome. They wimped out on it, and took the safe route. Having Jamie as the killer would have brought all kinds of possibilities. The ambiguous ending would lead the series awry in the next installment, and then they rebooted the series a bit for Halloween H20. As a die hard Halloween fan, I will never forgive Director Dominique Othenin-Girard for being so moronic. He ruined this series, and killed the momentum from Halloween IV. Donald Pleasence yells GO HOME, MICHAEL. GO HOME! at one point during this movie. That was actually good advice. It will bore slasher fans, and irritate Halloween fans to no end. 2\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 November 2013","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Yes, I own this movie.

He loves being in the spotlight and brags in front of a young interviewer about his idea of justice winning the case, at any price. He's the kind of lawyers, how to put it, had he defended Max Cady, there would have probably be no Cape Fear. But he fools no one, the man is driven by his own ego.And it's fitting his character to see him putting on a tuxedo to assist a Charity event, sponsored by the Church, and where all the big shots of Chicago's Court are present. Vail's charisma leaves no doubt, he's admired and loathed by his peers, on the top of them, State's Attorney John Shaughnessy (John Mahoney), whose protégée and most valuable prosecutor is Janet, Vail's ex-girlfriend, played by a young Laura Linney, and the way both interplay suggest that there are still some romantic vibes between them.The sequence is a school case of exposition, showing also what a respectable figure the Archbishop is. He doesn't know it yet, but after making a little joke about corrupt lawyers, he'll be the posthumous revealer of Law's darkest sides. And a young choir boy standing behind him will help.The day after, his body is found gruesomely murdered, and the Chicago Police quickly finds the mysterious altar boy (Edward Norton) running away, highlighting the typical guilty-until proved-innocent case. Aaron Stampler is his name and when he appears on TV, exhausted and all blood-covered, he instantly catches the eye of Martin Vail, who more than anyone, anticipates the juicy implications of such a case in terms of publicity  he offers his services pro bono.At that moment, as viewers, we have all the evidence against Stampler, but it's hard to believe such an angelic face, with a severe stammer, can be capable of such barbarity. There has to be something.Stampler's version is also intriguing, he doesn't remember anything, let alone having killed the priest. Vail is convinced there was a third person, but for the rest of the world, on the top of them again, the late Archbishop's friend Shaughnessy, Stampler must be sentenced to death. He assigns Janet as the prosecutor. So, let's get this straight, Primal Fear is a formula movie many plots point happen too conveniently, and fit some characterization we're familiar with the corrupt powerful man, the cocky lawyer, the workaholic young female upstart etc.But what Gregory Hobblit, the director, knows is to hook you to the story just when you ask yourself where this is going, when the love-and-hate relationship between Vail and Janet becomes a bit redundant, he keeps your interest back on the track with the surprising metamorphosis of Aaron as Roy, a sociopath who claims to have murdered the priest. Naturally, it's at that moment that the camera stopped recording, failing to provide a piece of evidence for Vail. But the diagnosis from the psychiatrist (Frances McDormand) is categorical Aaron's dual personality put him in an amnesic state when Roy controls his body, like he did, when he murdered the priest.Too convenient again? Not quite.Vail realizes that he was half right, there was indeed a third man, but only one killer, but the 'insanity plea' is impossible when you just pleaded 'not guilty'. The situation gets tricky until a revelation about the Archbishop's activities, the kind that a videotape can prove, comes to his hands. Again a new dilemma, exposing the videotape would provide a motive for the adversary, despite making the victim look sympathetic. He can send it to Janet, but would she ruin the priest's reputation, loses her job, just to win? The film gets delightfully cynical as far a justice procedural are concerned, one is governed by his ego, another by higher instances, never the idea of justice seems to guide their actions.The plot intricacies get more and more exciting, although sometimes distracted by an unnecessary subplot about the priest' connections with the mob, and it also distracts on Norton's spectacular performance as Aaron Stapler, which finally explodes at the film's climactic confrontation. I wouldn't dare to spoil that moment, many viewers expected it and got it, just like Vail who knew which button to push to win. But just when you believe that things go too easy, and some lessons are never taught, the film's conclusion is perfect to put his cynicism into perspective and allow us to look at him with more sympathetic eyes.I'm very careful with my words because anything I say can become a huge clue, but even if you expect the final revelation which is not quite a twist ending after all, but more of a twisted one, there's another revelation that the film carries it stands on two names Edward Norton. All the actors did a terrific job, but Norton, in his acting debut, reveals an extraordinary potential by playing such a wide range of emotions in one person. I was already impressed by his work as a lawyer in The People vs. Larry Flynt and I wondered why he didn't get an Oscar nomination, I got my answer with Primal Fear. No one could look as innocent and menacing in one role.There are two categories of courtroom dramas. Number one movies centered on a crime mystery where the main purpose is to prove that the accused is either guilty or innocent. Number two is the more interesting, the one that questions the ideal of justice and its compatibility with Law's technicalities, it generally offers a disillusioned lawyer a path to redemption or confront an idealistic one to the limits of the system.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"20 November 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Primal Fear opens with Richard Gere as a lawyer named Martin Vail. He loves being in the spotlight and brags in front of a young interviewer about his idea of justice winning the case, at any price. He's the kind of lawyers, how to put it, had he defended Max Cady, there would have probably be no Cape Fear. But he fools no one, the man is driven by his own ego.And it's fitting his character to see him putting on a tuxedo to assist a Charity event, sponsored by the Church, and where all the big shots of Chicago's Court are present. Vail's charisma leaves no doubt, he's admired and loathed by his peers, on the top of them, State's Attorney John Shaughnessy (John Mahoney), whose protégée and most valuable prosecutor is Janet, Vail's ex-girlfriend, played by a young Laura Linney, and the way both interplay suggest that there are still some romantic vibes between them.The sequence is a school case of exposition, showing also what a respectable figure the Archbishop is. He doesn't know it yet, but after making a little joke about corrupt lawyers, he'll be the posthumous revealer of Law's darkest sides. And a young choir boy standing behind him will help.The day after, his body is found gruesomely murdered, and the Chicago Police quickly finds the mysterious altar boy (Edward Norton) running away, highlighting the typical guilty-until proved-innocent case. Aaron Stampler is his name and when he appears on TV, exhausted and all blood-covered, he instantly catches the eye of Martin Vail, who more than anyone, anticipates the juicy implications of such a case in terms of publicity  he offers his services pro bono.At that moment, as viewers, we have all the evidence against Stampler, but it's hard to believe such an angelic face, with a severe stammer, can be capable of such barbarity. There has to be something.Stampler's version is also intriguing, he doesn't remember anything, let alone having killed the priest. Vail is convinced there was a third person, but for the rest of the world, on the top of them again, the late Archbishop's friend Shaughnessy, Stampler must be sentenced to death. He assigns Janet as the prosecutor. So, let's get this straight, Primal Fear is a formula movie many plots point happen too conveniently, and fit some characterization we're familiar with the corrupt powerful man, the cocky lawyer, the workaholic young female upstart etc.But what Gregory Hobblit, the director, knows is to hook you to the story just when you ask yourself where this is going, when the love-and-hate relationship between Vail and Janet becomes a bit redundant, he keeps your interest back on the track with the surprising metamorphosis of Aaron as Roy, a sociopath who claims to have murdered the priest. Naturally, it's at that moment that the camera stopped recording, failing to provide a piece of evidence for Vail. But the diagnosis from the psychiatrist (Frances McDormand) is categorical Aaron's dual personality put him in an amnesic state when Roy controls his body, like he did, when he murdered the priest.Too convenient again? Not quite.Vail realizes that he was half right, there was indeed a third man, but only one killer, but the 'insanity plea' is impossible when you just pleaded 'not guilty'. The situation gets tricky until a revelation about the Archbishop's activities, the kind that a videotape can prove, comes to his hands. Again a new dilemma, exposing the videotape would provide a motive for the adversary, despite making the victim look sympathetic. He can send it to Janet, but would she ruin the priest's reputation, loses her job, just to win? The film gets delightfully cynical as far a justice procedural are concerned, one is governed by his ego, another by higher instances, never the idea of justice seems to guide their actions.The plot intricacies get more and more exciting, although sometimes distracted by an unnecessary subplot about the priest' connections with the mob, and it also distracts on Norton's spectacular performance as Aaron Stapler, which finally explodes at the film's climactic confrontation. I wouldn't dare to spoil that moment, many viewers expected it and got it, just like Vail who knew which button to push to win. But just when you believe that things go too easy, and some lessons are never taught, the film's conclusion is perfect to put his cynicism into perspective and allow us to look at him with more sympathetic eyes.I'm very careful with my words because anything I say can become a huge clue, but even if you expect the final revelation which is not quite a twist ending after all, but more of a twisted one, there's another revelation that the film carries it stands on two names Edward Norton. All the actors did a terrific job, but Norton, in his acting debut, reveals an extraordinary potential by playing such a wide range of emotions in one person. I was already impressed by his work as a lawyer in The People vs. Larry Flynt and I wondered why he didn't get an Oscar nomination, I got my answer with Primal Fear. No one could look as innocent and menacing in one role.There are two categories of courtroom dramas. Number one movies centered on a crime mystery where the main purpose is to prove that the accused is either guilty or innocent. Number two is the more interesting, the one that questions the ideal of justice and its compatibility with Law's technicalities, it generally offers a disillusioned lawyer a path to redemption or confront an idealistic one to the limits of the system.

There were a number produced during and in the years following World War II, such as this one or the British-made Above Us the Waves, but there have also been more recent examples such as the German Das Boot (also about World War II) and The Hunt for Red October, Crimson Tide and K-19 The Widowmaker, all with a Cold War setting. Run Silent, Run Deep shares with the last two films mentioned above the theme of a conflict between the submarine commander and his second- in-command. In all three films the two men have very different personalities and in each case the commander is an obsessive, driven character while his executive officer is more relaxed. All three films cast two major stars opposite one another- Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington in Crimson Tide, Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson in K-19 and Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster here. Gable's character, Commander P.J. Richardson, is the captain of a submarine which is sunk by a Japanese destroyer in the Bungo Straits. He persuades the Navy Board to give him command of another submarine, the USS Nerka, thus bringing him into conflict with the Nerka's executive officer, Lieutenant Jim Bledsoe, who possesses the necessary qualifications for command and believes that he should have been promoted to the captaincy. The crew also dislike Richardson, a strict disciplinarian who forces them to go through endless drills, and would much prefer to serve under the more easygoing Bledsoe. As the film progresses it becomes clear that Richardson is obsessed with avenging the loss of his previous submarine by sinking the destroyer responsible, even though he is under orders to avoid the Bungo Straits. The purpose of his repeated drills is to perfect a daring manoeuvre which he believes will give him an advantage over the enemy ship. The film is on one level a tense and exciting action\/adventure drama, and works very well as such. On a deeper level, however, it is also a psychological study of the two men and a study in style of leadership. Both Gable and the scriptwriters resisted the temptation to make Richardson a simple villain. Certainly, he is a difficult, prickly character, unpopular with the crew and his subordinate officers. His cavalier interpretation of orders would not win him many friends among his superiors if they knew what he was up to. Yet his leadership inspires his men to brilliant feats of seamanship, enabling them to sink three Japanese vessels. Although on a human level the likable Bledsoe is well-versed in the arts of making friends and influencing people, he is also more cautious and pragmatic. There is a strong implication that, had he been in command, the crew might not have accomplished so much. The two men are very well played by Gable and Lancaster. In 1958 Gable was of course coming to the end of his career- he only had another two years to live, although in that period he was to make another five films- but Lancaster's still had another thirty years to run, and the film came at a time when his career was undergoing a change of direction. Although there had been exceptions, such as The Killers and From Here to Eternity, most of his films from the forties and fifties had been action adventures in which he had played physically demanding roles. For a war film, Run Silent, Run Deep does not contain much in the way of physical action- most of the action sequences were created using models- but rather looks forward to the sort of thoughtful, character-driven movies in which Lancaster was to specialise in the sixties and seventies.Robert Wise is today best remembered as the director of those two famous musicals, West Side Story and The Sound of Music, but he was a versatile director who could work in most genres, including films noirs, Westerns, disaster movies and war films. Run Silent, Run Deep is never going to equal something like The Sound of Music in the affections of the public, but it serves as a very good example of another side of Wise's talents.

Then you asked me to go on with a false one- Newland Archer Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a well-respected lawyer who begins to fall for Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) whilst he is engaged to her cousin Mary Welland (Winona Ryder). There is much more depth to the film than just an internal love story as it expresses the lives of the upper class in New York. The exclusivity and distinction of the elite is beautifully shown in this film of passion and loss as the masquerade of the period politics slowly fall apart in the eyes of Newland Archer.The film Age of Innocence takes us into a new realm of skill shown by Martin Scorsese with this brilliant period piece set on the novel by Edith Wharton written in 1920. Scorsese's repertoire has largely held the grit of films such as Taxi Driver, Mean Streets and Goodfellas, but with Age of Innocence there is a more delicate touch to the way the plot unfolds. The novel was introduced to Scorsese by Jay Cocks, who then co wrote the script with him in is his first attempt at converting English literary into a film. What makes this a magnificent piece is Scorsese's understanding of creating an atmosphere that constantly intrigues despite the fact little may seemingly be going on. It is the lighting of the sets that really captures the period of the film, as the candles and fires flicker on the screen. The whole mood of the film stirs within the use of the shadows Scorsese spreads over those whose unorthodox nature could not fit into the mold of the strict high family politics.

(There have been some dire examples, Street Fighter being a particularly egregious one). The successful Tomb Raider series, dating back to 1996, boasts in its beautiful heroine Lara Croft one of the most instantly recognisable characters from any video game, familiar to many who have never played the game itself, so a film adaptation was inevitable. For promotional purposes Lara has been impersonated by many young actresses and models; in the late nineties the young British actress Rhona Mitra was frequently promoted as the face of Lara Croft. The film-makers, however, evidently wanted someone more internationally famous, but although they cast the American actress Angelina Jolie in the role they resisted the temptation to make Lara an American. As in the game, she remains a British aristocrat living in a stately home with a butler. The plot is largely based upon the Indiana Jones formula, with a few influences imported from the James Bond series. Like Indy, Lara is an archaeologist whose scientific expeditions always end up turning into an adventure, generally because she has stumbled across an artifact with mystical powers. There will also be a gang of bad guys in search of the said artifact, which they need in order to achieve their goal of world domination, a goal which it falls to our intrepid heroine to thwart. That synopsis would fit both the Lara Croft films; indeed, with a change in the sex of the leading character it would also fit most of the Indiana Jones films. (The one exception is Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, the weakest entry in that particular franchise). In Lara Croft Tomb Raider the mysterious artifact is a metal triangle with the power to control time and the bad guys seeking it are the Illuminati, that secretive group beloved of all conspiracy theorists. Another theme in the film concerns Lara's relationship with her father Lord Richard, who died when she was young, and who it turns out was murdered by the Illuminati. Richard is played by Jon Voight, who is of course Angelina's father in real life. As I said, there are also a few Bond influences, such as the use of several exotic locations- here Venice, Cambodia and Siberia- in the one film. Just as Bond has his Bond Girls, so Lara has her Croft Boys, and the Croft Boy in this film is Alex West, played by Daniel Craig who of course himself later took over the role of 007. Alex is an American; there cannot be many films in which an American actress plays a British character and a British actor plays an American one. Angelina copes well with the British accent, although she perhaps does not sound quite upper-class enough for Lara's supposed background. (Foreign actresses called upon to play a British character are more often guilty of the opposite fault, that of making someone from a working-class background sound like a Duchess). In general, however, Angelina's performance is quite a good one, showing that she has the looks, charisma and physical presence to play a role like this. A sequel named Lara Croft Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life was released in 2003. Despite its clumsy title and the law which states that sequels are generally inferior to their originals, it is actually the better of the films by a considerable margin, giving the lovely Angelina a vehicle more worthy of her talents. Unfortunately, she is the only thing about the original film that is any good. None of the other actors, including Voight and Craig, make much of an impression, but the film's two biggest problems are the way it is written and the way it is directed. The script went through many drafts produced by several writers; the producers were presumably unaware of the adage when in a hole, stop digging. Frenetic attempts to take a bad script and make it better frequently have the effect of making it even worse. In the event, five writers including director Simon West are credited with the final version, and this hotchpotch of nonsense certainly has the feel of something produced by a committee. As for the direction, West seems to have made the mistake of assuming that because the film was based on a video game he needed to reproduce the furious, hectic style of one. The opening scene features a robot named SIMON, and I wondered if this was a reference to the director's Christian name. If so, it seems like an apt one; a robot on autopilot could have directed a better film than this one. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 November 2013","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Video games have in recent years been a frequent source of inspiration for action\/adventure films, although it must be said that few of the resulting movies have been any good, the recent Prince of Persia The Sands of Time probably being the best that I have seen.

Humphrey Bogart plays the more emotionally unstable of the two, and Walter Huston plays the older experienced slightly crazy gold seeker. The theme of the movie is pronounced by Huston's character early on where he says that gold changes men. Bogart's character insists this is foolish talk, but gradually degrades from a man who just wants life to turn around for him -- to a man obsessed with getting as much as he can once they find their gold. Tim Holt plays the third man in the group and fights to keep his conscience clear despite all the temptations. This ensemble piece keeps you interested as you watch the characters react and change as they mine more of the gold dust. It is also an educational movie, because the process of mining is taught by Huston's character to his two younger students in different parts of the movie. The pluses of this movie are the story by the Director John Huston, the characters, the actors, and the simple pacing without a lot of extra un-needed fluff. Today's moviegoers might have a problem with the lack of booming special effects and fast paced action but it isn't needed for this movie. Bogart, in my opinion, was deserved at least an Oscar nomination for this portrayal -- as his feelings are so evident by his facial expressions.

Humphrey Bogart plays the more emotionally unstable of the two, and Walter Huston plays the older experienced slightly crazy gold seeker. The theme of the movie is pronounced by Huston's character early on where he says that gold changes men. Bogart's character insists this is foolish talk, but gradually degrades from a man who just wants life to turn around for him -- to a man obsessed with getting as much as he can once they find their gold. Tim Holt plays the third man in the group and fights to keep his conscience clear despite all the temptations. This ensemble piece keeps you interested as you watch the characters react and change as they mine more of the gold dust. It is also an educational movie, because the process of mining is taught by Huston's character to his two younger students in different parts of the movie. The pluses of this movie are the story by the Director John Huston, the characters, the actors, and the simple pacing without a lot of extra un-needed fluff. Today's moviegoers might have a problem with the lack of booming special effects and fast paced action but it isn't needed for this movie. Bogart, in my opinion, was deserved at least an Oscar nomination for this portrayal -- as his feelings are so evident by his facial expressions.

All of those elements make Scarface not only a Gangster classic,but also a Cult classic and a amazing remake that is Brian De Palma and Al Pacino at their best.Set in Miami,Florida in the early 1980s,Scarface tells the story of Tony Montana(Al Pacino),a Cuban immigrant who has arrived in the United States wanting success and the pursuit of the American dream. While in the city of Miami,Tony joins a drug cartel rising in the ranks and becoming one of the top suppliers of Cocaine while gaining money and power. Although successful and wealthy,Tony starts using his own coke supply and starts becoming paranoid,erratic and out of control leading to Tony's downfall for himself and the people around him.Released in 1983,Scarface while a modest success at the Box Office was panned by nearly every major critic in America at the time because of the film's Graphic Violence and excessive language. But since it's 1983 release Scarface has become a Cult Film and one of the most iconic films of all time with Scarface and Tony Montana becoming icons in not just pop culture but also Hip-Hop culture where Hip-Hop and Rap artists truly worship the film. Scarface is one of the all time great epic Gangster movies and is an amazing film on so many levels because what director Brian De Palma does is take Howard Hawks' original Gangster Classic Scarface(1932)and takes it from the world of Prohibition in the 1920s to the world drug infested world of early 1980s Miami,Florida pulling viewers into a world that is filled with excess and money with over the top style and brilliance that keeps you glued to the screen even though the world of Scarface is dangerous and violent. Scarface is also a film about the pursuit of the American Dream but the American Dream is done in a flashy style with the main characters surround by drugs,money and death in this film with the American Dream told in a dark tale of tragedy,violence and downfall. Brian De Palma tricks viewers by showing the glitz and glamor of the Gangster and drug world of Scarface but then shows viewers how vicious and dark the drug world really is. At it's core Scarface is a morality tale told a Shakespeare way about the choices a person can make in life and how it can affect not only yourself but others as well and it definitely applies to Tony Montana. Tony Montana is one of the greatest and most iconic characters is movie history and a character who's been imitated and quoted throughout pop culture and is also a classic antihero who wants the world and everything in it no matter what. Tony is a complex character who we like not because of the things that he does but because of who he is because Tony has his own rules and codes that he lives by and never breaking them. We also see two different sides of Tony before and after his success which shows us his rise and fall. Before his success,Tony's head is on straight and he's more optimistic on the rise but as Tony becomes more successful with money and power Tony becomes more paranoid and distrusting with not only himself but with the people around him which leads to his unfortunate fall acting like a bomb about to go off. The rise and fall of Tony Montana is one of the most compelling and tragic rise and fall tales you will ever see on film. The violence in Scarface is Graphic,shocking and will disturb viewers because of it's darkness and brutality but I think the violence had to be in the film because it shows how dangerous and harsh the drug world can be. The screenplay by Oliver Stone is amazing and memorable with so many great lines and lots of F-bombs. Some of the dialog by Stone has become so iconic and unforgettable and are staples in pop culture especially the film's most famous line that comes at the end. The ending of Scarface is easily one of the greatest endings I have ever seen on film because there is thrills,great lines,violence and surprises adding to the legend of Scarface and Tony Montana. An amazing conclusion to a great film.The whole cast is terrific. Al Pacino is excellent,iconic and at his best as Tony Montana,with Pacino being intense,over the top and unforgettable. Amazing performance by Pacino. Steven Bauer is fantastic as Manny,Tony's best friend and right hand man. Michelle Pheiffer is amazing and sexy as Elvira,Frank's girlfriend and Tony's love interest. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is terrific as Gina Montana,Tony's sister. Robert Loggia is outstanding and memorable as Frank Lopez,Tony's boss. F.Murray Abraham is wonderful as Omar,an employee of Frank's. Paul Shener is sensational as Sosa,a business partner of Tony's. Harris Yulan is wonderful as Mel Bernstein,a corrupt cop. Miriam Colem is captivating as Mama Montana,Tony and Gina's Mother.The direction by Brian De Palma is brilliant and stylish,with De Palma always moving the camera with close-ups,zoom ins bringing his signature style to the film. Great direction,De Palma.The score by Giorgio Moroder is amazing,memorable and matches the film's tone. Fantastic score,Moroder. The film also has wonderful soundtrack with songs by Paul Engemann(Push It To The Limit),Deborah Harry(Rush Rush),Amy Holland(She's On Fire,Turn Out The Night),Elizabeth Daily(Shake It Up,I'm Hot Tonight),Beth Andersen(Dance,Dance,Dance),Maria Conchita Alonso(Vamos a Bailar)and Frank Sinatra(Strangers In The Night). Incredible soundtrack.In final word,if you love Gangster Films,Cult Films,Brian De Palma,Al Pacino or movies in general,I highly suggest you watch Scarface,an excellent,unforgettable epic Gangster Classic that is Brian De Palma and Al Pacino at their best.

The film's comprised of a series of vignettes, some of which are powerful, most of which are overly loud and busy.Though initially shapeless, Crooklyn eventually reveals itself to be told from the point of view of Troy (Zelda Harris), a young girl who watches as her mother slides unexpectedly into sickness and then death. With mommy's passing comes Troy's new-found respect for the strength and struggles of African American women; throughout all the film's commotion, Mommy has been the raft keeping this family unit afloat.Like most of Lee's films, Crooklyn exudes nostalgia for New York's promenades, stoops and brownstones. The film isn't conventionally sentimental, though, and instead adopts a tone of aggression. Things happen hard, fast, and our little family seems always under siege.Those familiar with Lee's background will perhaps find Crooklyn more touching than those who aren't; similar to the mother in the film, Lee's own mother died of cancer. Lee's father, like Delroy Lindo's character, was also a struggling jazz musician (and clandestine drug addict).
