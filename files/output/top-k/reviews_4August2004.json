[{"date":"4 August 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  I find myself perplexed by the hostile comments concerning Estella Warren's character, Sophia Simone, in Driven. Ms. Warren was chosen for this role because she fit the character, i.e. the type of model\/minor actress that often hang around race car drivers. She was given the thankless task of having to play off two very wooden actors in Schweiger and Pardue, who seem to be obsessed with one another in a sort of odd homoerotic subtext. Other than her role as beard to these two, Estella's role in Driven is to stand around looking concerned, which she does reasonably well, especially considering this was her first major film role. Sophia is given no backstory. Apparently she is a synchronized swimmer, which is the only thing that could explain her swimming pool scene, which is esthetically lovely but unrelated to the plot. Incidentally, that pool scene is the only scene in the entire film with believable emotions, which makes me suspect that it was not written by Stallone, and may even have been improvised. Not surprisingly, this scene is often left out of Driven when it is shown on TV. Thus the only scene in the movie with a discernible heart is removed, leaving the film even more cold and empty than it already is.The problems with Driven is that is all about special effects, but pretends to be about human beings. Stallone has been milking the Rocky formula endlessly, and does so again, stressing male competition as a form of bonding. No female character in a Stallone film is ever allowed to do anything but look worshipfully at the male characters, waiting patiently for them to come to her, if they survive. In that pool scene Ms. Warren does something unique for a female in a Stallone film. She shows that a female character has a skill and a life outside of, and independent of, the male characters. The hard thing for me to accept is that a woman of such skill and beauty would ever allow a man to tell her she is just a distraction in his life and have anything to do with him ever again. Overall, Driven is a fairly dull and pedestrian movie. It is not the worst film ever made, but it is what one would expect from a collaboration between Sylvester Stallone and Renny Harlin, two self important males with large egos and small talent. Neither has ever made a film with any real soul. Who would expect anything different when they work together?

I am, I ashamedly confess, cut from the same cloth, and ten times more likely to sit through some slam-bang Hollywood garbage that I've seen a hundred times than some arty little French film, despite how good everyone says it is. It is through this stubborn philosophy that I almost missed out on probably the best film I have seen this year, and what has become one of my favourites of all-time. The intention of this review is to advise others not to make the same mistake and bypass this modern masterpiece.On paper, it seems unremarkable; the story of a little girl, Amelie, raised by un-loving parents in France, who spends her entire youth without companionship and, as a result, becomes over-imaginative in the extreme. Years later, she moves to the town of Montemart and, while leading a relatively lonely existence, she sets out to improve the lives of those around her in her own unique and special way, while trying to find the love she so desperately craves. Admittedly, the plot does (very) vaguely echo that of Jane Austens' novel 'Emma' (recently adapted for the screen for Gwyneth Paltrow, and modernised in Amy Heckerlings' 'Clueless') but, that aside, this is one of the most strikingly original and wonderful films ever made.It's a rare occurrence to describe a film as 'perfect', but no other term is appropriate to describe 'Amelie'. To begin with, its central performance from Audrey Tautou is astounding. Child-like, naive and impossibly adorable, it's hard to conceive any other actress in the role (interesting, given the fact that the film was originally written for British actress Emily Watson and the first script treatment was titled 'Emily'). It's difficult to recollect the last time a screen character had such an emotional resonance with an audience; you feel every high and low of the emotional roller-coaster Amelie endures during the story. However, it's not just a one-woman show, and the gifted set of supporting characters &#150; especially Matthieu Kassovitz as love interest Nino and Serge Merlin as the mysterious 'Glass Man' - more than bring the film to life. Even the look of the film is strikingly wonderful, as director Jean-Pierre Jeunet paints the city of Montemart in vivid, lively colours, and animates Amelies' reality-bending imagination perfectly.I can honestly say that you won't find a more heart-warming, uplifting and flat-out enjoyable film anywhere, never mind in English. Do yourself a favour; don't miss out like I nearly did. Reach for your reading glasses and prepare to be amazed.

Robocop 1 was a classic, one of the best films ever made. R2 and R3 (yes, even R3) aren't great, but they're good, and thus worthy to be its sequels. For those who don't want to stop there, here's why, especially considering that this movie has a reputation of being a gore-fest without any heart. The story in R2 *is* as engaging as the one in R1. Problem is that director Kirshner (sp) made the mistake of making this film TOO violent, instead of giving it the perfect balance between violence and storytelling that R1 had. Thus, R2 has a beautifully-written story that's buried underneath the over-the-top violence, and here's proof &#150; The film aptly points out the greed and hypocrisy of big business, where the fatcats are smiling in front of the cameras, pretending to care about someone\/something other than money, but in private, all they wish to do is look out for money and for those who are rich, like themselves. ******SPOILERS*******Clearly, Daniel O'herlihy's character supposedly wanting to 'fix' the city, but only worrying about having his company sued once Cain mows down dozens of innocent people is just that. And before then sleeping with that gold-digger before selling her out to save his own image, whether the evidence exists against her or not, we'll find it, indeed. Besides this, there are sub-plots, such as the one of Robo wondering if he's still human (before coming up to the rushed conclusion at the end of the film that he, in fact, is). Plus the kid drug dealer (of all people!) reminded Robo of his now-lost son. It's easy to hate that little drug-dealing cretin, no doubt. But if one kept watching, even his character had statements to make. For starters, he's eating fries that are drowned in ketchup for dinner, even though he's a millionaire! That says something about the value of expensive luxuries, since something that costs more won't necessarily bring you more joy. Imagine someone who can afford any meal he wants, and all he wants is something you can buy for a dollar at a fast food place. That's a good commentary. And later, Robo found him as he was dying inside a truckload of cash, which is another commentary that everyone dies eventually, no matter how much money they have to supposedly protect them. How ironic that the kid asked Robo to keep a vigil over him as he bled to death, considering he was the one who shot a pair of cops earlier, and before then had helped dismember Robo himself. It's still not clear what he meant when he pointed out that Robo knew how dying felt, and that it sucked &#150; whether he meant Murphy's original death in R1 or Robo's dismemberment at the start of R2. But either way, he didn't even apologize for trying to literally tear him apart at the start, which only adds to his realism. There's a build-up of tension when Robo's told that the mass murderer was Cain, and that Cain now is bigger than him, so Robo has got to be wondering if his power is enough to beat Cain. That's a fresh change from villains who appear just to fight the hero in too many movies out there, as the audience can anticipate the climactic fight between these two cyborgs for half an hour before it happens. There's also Robo being 'neutered' by the addition of 200+ idiotic directives, making him be less than the tough-as-nails cop he wants to be. So this guy (can he be called anything else? a machine wouldn't do that) decides to risk his life by flooding his system with electricity, if it means going back to his previous self, rather than continue existing like he is. *******END SPOILERS******** But I must've been watching another Robocop 2 than everyone else, because this film is apparently nothing more than a brainless bloodbath. Yeah, right! But it's not perfect, and here's what keeps it from being as good as its marvelous predecessor. For one thing, the human cops kill criminals much too casually. Lewis kills two guys who Robo had locked into a closet at the beginning, then she shoots the baseball team coach as she's trading gunfire with him while hiding behind Robo's figure. It's one thing for Robo to be casual about the righteous taking of a life, but not for the human cops. Humans are supposed to have feelings, and it's hard to take the characters as seriously when they shoot someone in the head and then discuss lunch in the same breath. And the violence IS too excessive, with too many expendable characters who are cannon fodder who show up simply to get killed off, especially at the end when Cain busted out of the OCP building and had his rampage. But that doesn't take away from the good plot that is lurking underneath all that carnage. It's the kind of storyline that you'll see if you do yourself the favor of watching this film for the second or third times, once you already know what scenes of violence to expect, thus they won't be as shocking any more, and you can thus spend more attention on the plot twists and dialogue instead, because that's where the movie's strength is.

","genre":"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"4 August 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  `Moonstruck' is about several people coming together in love in a fairy tale sort of way.  Set in the Italian region of New York under a moon so big and bright, glowing down on the characters, casting its spell of joyous love on them.  At the front line are Loretta Castorini (Cher), her fiancée's brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage) and her mother (Olympia Dukakis) and father (Vincent Gardenia).  These characters, among others, fall in love with each other and others.Loretta is the central character, and her story is started when Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) proposes to her.  She accepts, and Johnny flies off to Sicily to be there when his ill mother dies, but he leaves Loretta instructions to call up his estranged brother Ronny and invite him to the wedding, in an effort to settle some `bad      '.  She visits Ronny, who works in a butcher shop, and we meet him when she does, in one of the film&#145;s grandest scenes.  She learns that the `bad      ' is that, five years earlier, Johnny         ally distracted Ronny while he was using a meat slicer, resulting in the loss of his hand, and his own fiancée left him because of the disfigurement.  Ronny is a complex character but an easy one to accept, Cage comically combining the manly ferocity of Stanley Kowalski and the kind of goofiness you'd see in a Mel Brooks film.  His best scene is when he shouts in anger at his wooden hand as a stunned Loretta watches.But, surprisingly, Johnny's absence over the next two nights of the full moon and its spell allows Loretta to find love she never thought she'd have in Ronny.  Meanwhile, her mother Rose learns that her husband Cosmo is seeing a         , and starts searching for the answer to why men always chase women.  Rose also has a sort of         al dinner with a college professor (John Mahoney).  He's looking for a woman, but she's just looking for release, and when he asks her to come to his apartment she refuses because she `knows who she is'.  But, still, it's a great scene, mostly because of the writing.  Rose isn't turned into a weepy mess because of the news on her husband, and Mahoney isn't a    -crazed, slimy character; he sort of looks on in wonder as she dispenses all the knowledge she's gained with a quiet, confident wisdom.It's not a sad story, though, and the characters all come together at the end, in the best scene, in Rose's kitchen at breakfast time.  The scene is funny and touching, when everything is resolved.  Rose demands Cosmo stops seeing his         .

Judging by the last chapter (although it is narrated from the first person point of view of Francis Doyle), I assume that the novel is based on Fuhrman's own actual childhood experiences and developed into a comic book of the same title. Unfortunately, while both the novel and the movie are quite good, the movie lacks some of the structure as well as more significant, yet controversial images than does the film (for obvious reasons on this latter point--they are catering to younger audiences and pre-teen sex doesn't go over well with your always alert conservative censors). Likewise, the novel, which is set in Savannah circa 1970 and deals with heated issues of racism (and our characters recognition of the fallacies of generalization). It was risqué enough to develop a movie which contains among its characters a young school girl who has not only engaged in an incestial relationship, but also attempted suicide. This is the story of four boys in at Blessed Heart, a Catholic School for Boys. Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch) and Tim Sullivan (Kieran Culkin) are figures that model Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn (although Francis is ruled by considerably fewer rules than Tom's Aunt Polly reserved for her own boy). Tim Sullivan is the inspiration for the gang, living the credo that danger and trouble is their only defense against boredom. Partly, their only defense against the absurd rules of society and the meaningless ritual of adults (our character Tim is of the Holden Caufield variety), is a comic book (The Atomic Trinity) which the friends create, which parallels their various coming-of-age experiences with pranks and first love and so forth. Part of the screen time is shared with animated scenes of our comic book heroes at work. Francis and Tim seem to differ on their goals, however. For Tim, his goal is the revolt against Sister Assumpta (Jodi Foster) who embodies most of the absurd rules as head of the Catholic School. For example, she is the one who confiscates Tim's copy of a book by William Blake (I think it was called 'The Creation'), and as such, is seen as an unruly censor. Tim is out to defy that absurdity. His character is the bildungsromane type more Francis. His character is much smarter, much more aware of his surroundings. But sadly, it is all he is focused on. As you see in the comic book scenes, he is the hero who is only concerned with bringing down the flaming skull, which is actually Sister Assumpta. Blessed Heart represents everything finds wrong with the world around him.Francis, too, may be disgusted with the hypocrisy of the Catholic teachings and Blessed Heart in general, but his disgust with the world and likewise his concern is Margie Flynn (Jena Malone), his first true love. Flynn is an utterly sad character in a film where you might just expect boyhood pranks on unsuspecting authority. Flynn is a young quiet girl who attempted to kill herself because she thought she was going crazy and hated herself for an incestial relationship she carried on with her brother. Francis, through his real actions and through his comic book hero image, tries to rescue the frail Margie Flynn. She is the girl he is forever in love with, and her frailty may in part be part of the oppression he sees (like Tim). They don't tell much about her parents or brother in the movie, but in the novel, they are divorced and Donnie Flynn is a real sadistic creep, at least towards Francis and the other boys. Margie Flynn is really a difficult character to endure, particularly for younger audiences, considering the circumstances. The story starts out like another 'Heaven Help Us' type (only more intellectual and much funnier) of Catholic School boys run amuck, but the introduction of Margie's character puts a weird spin about things. I'm not sure that they developed her character enough for this movie, although much of the focus within the Flynn-Doyle relationship was on Francis and not really Margie. Maybe if Emile Hirsch didn't always act so spaced out all the time, this aspect of the story might've been more effective. Meanwhile, when the four boys's comic book is confiscated by Sister Assumpta, the boys (Tim in particular) get the idea that they're going to get retaliation on Blessed Heart and, in particular, Sister Assumpta (amongst all other things that they think need revolting against in that William Blake revolutionary sense that Tim abides by) by releasing a panther (in the novel, it was just a bobcat) into the school. By doing so, they would be declared the local legends of danger. This is going to be their mark of importance. This is when each of the boys start questioning their loyalty to this unofficial pact of a crusade for danger. Francis and Tim (the closet of the four friends), too, start questioning just how far they're willing to go because, their idea of importance changes. For Tim, it's all or nothing. For Francis, he's second guessing just how easy (and necessary) such a prank would be and also, is meanwhile, wrapped up in his own little world with Margie Flynn.This is one of those coming-of-age films with young characters who have a heightened sense of self-awareness and such in the style of 'Stand by Me' and hell, even 'Fandango' and so forth. It's funny and it's sad. Overall, it's a pretty good movie worth catching. Live dangerously!

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"4 August 2004","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  It's sad that viewers haven't seen the meaning here. R3 decided to water the violence down and make it a family action film. This convinced most viewers that they wouldn't like it. It's a stereotype that action films are typically brainless and unfortunately, the films that try to break that stereotype aren't a financial success most of the time. So it seems that the stereotype is here to stay. Most people clearly missed the social commentaries that R3's making. It mentions that OCP is kicking people out of their homes, all in the name of making the city 'safer'. Message being that politicians only want to make the world safer for those who are rich, no one else. Did the audience miss this message when they call the film dumb? ******SPOILERS******** Officer Lewis' murder follows, which was anti-climactic. No slow motion screams, none of that BS. Just real, surprising, wasteful violence that shocks the audience in the sudden way it's carried out. The OCP agent was tired of her, so he decided to execute her on the spot, which was a waste of a great person, but then again, all deaths of good people are. Not that there isn't drama. Robo's frustration is obvious when he's unable to attack his partner's murderers, succeeding in being able to blow up the OCP agents' van and providing his side with a brief respite from the enemy's onslaught. He then carries his dying partner away, knowing that all his strength, armor and firepower is for naught, as she's dying in his arms anyway. One of the best lines anywhere is when Robo tells Lewis that she doesn't need to be scared because it won't hurt for much longer. So the good guys took a hit, and finally, it's time for Robo to hit back. The director copies one of the styles that made Robocop 1 so successful, where in R1 we had the privilege of accompanying Robo as he patrolled the city and searched for everyday criminals to apprehend. There's nothing wrong with director Dekker (sp) copying Verhoevan's (sp) style, since if it worked so well in R1, why not do it in R3 also? The audience that's been fed what feels like ages of anxiety from OCP now gets its (and Robo's) wish as Robo is finally able to delete Directive 4, finally allowing him to hunt down OCP employees just like he hunted down criminals in R1. Thus, we again can ride shotgun with Robo as he mows down OCP agents, and find out more about his new weapons. It's worthy to note that one scene from R3 is a carbon copy of a scene from R1, where R1 Robo confronted two men who were attacking a woman at knifepoint, and shot one man in the groin before the second surrendered. In R3, we have 2 male OCP agents who are harassing a teenaged prostitute, only this time using their status as power rather than a weapon. In both scenes, the audience is treated to seeing Robo's shadow as he approaches the horrible scene, ready to make it right. Only difference is his reaction, where instead of Your Move, Creep, it's Didn't You Hear? The Lady Said No!, followed by gunshots into the two OCP agents' kevlar vests, that sends them flying through glass. To all those Robocop 3 haters is &#150; you actually want MORE than this in a film??!! That's not the end of it. Following the rescue of the teenage prostitute, Robo tells her that she needs to get home, because she's breaking curfew! That's one of the sharpest social remarks I heard, where there's a curfew that's supposed to reduce crime by mandating teenagers to stay home at night, but obviously isn't working because the majority of crime is being committed by 'law-enforcing' OCP agents! **********END SPOILERS********* There's a lesson in there for people who thinks that quick, overnight solutions that simply sound good will work when applied to complicated problems. Real solutions are slow and difficult, not quick and easy. Not to say that Robocop 3 is a great film. It's not. Robocop 1 was a great film, but R2 and R3 *are* good films in their own right, and a good Trilogy together. But there *are* drawbacks to it, starting with the budget. It's painfully obvious that this film was under-funded, proven by the sets, special effects, and that tiny actors in R1 have huge parts here. Also, while watered-down violence to make a film family-oriented isn't a bad thing, the violence here is a bit TOO watered-down. And last, Robocop went from cyborg killing machine to compassionate social worker too easily. Considering how many people he casually (though rightly) killed in the past, it would've been more appropriate if he had felt confused at the feeling of having an orphaned girl embrace him for comfort, rather than instantly knowing that he needs to gently place his hand on top of the back of her head.

So the good guys took a hit, and finally, it's time for Robo to hit back. The director copies one of the styles that made Robocop 1 so successful, where in R1 we had the privilege of accompanying Robo as he patrolled the city and searched for everyday criminals to apprehend. There's nothing wrong with director Dekker (sp) copying Verhoevan's (sp) style, since if it worked so well in R1, why not do it in R3 also? The audience that's been fed what feels like ages of anxiety from OCP now gets its (and Robo's) wish as Robo is finally able to delete Directive 4, finally allowing him to hunt down OCP employees just like he hunted down criminals in R1. Thus, we again can ride shotgun with Robo as he mows down OCP agents, and find out more about his new weapons. It's worthy to note that one scene from R3 is a carbon copy of a scene from R1, where R1 Robo confronted two men who were attacking a woman at knifepoint, and shot one man in the groin before the second surrendered. In R3, we have 2 male OCP agents who are harassing a teenaged prostitute, only this time using their status as power rather than a weapon. In both scenes, the audience is treated to seeing Robo's shadow as he approaches the horrible scene, ready to make it right. Only difference is his reaction, where instead of Your Move, Creep, it's Didn't You Hear? The Lady Said No!, followed by gunshots into the two OCP agents' kevlar vests, that sends them flying through glass. To all those Robocop 3 haters is &#150; you actually want MORE than this in a film??!! That's not the end of it. Following the rescue of the teenage prostitute, Robo tells her that she needs to get home, because she's breaking curfew! That's one of the sharpest social remarks I heard, where there's a curfew that's supposed to reduce crime by mandating teenagers to stay home at night, but obviously isn't working because the majority of crime is being committed by 'law-enforcing' OCP agents! **********END SPOILERS********* There's a lesson in there for people who thinks that quick, overnight solutions that simply sound good will work when applied to complicated problems. Real solutions are slow and difficult, not quick and easy. Not to say that Robocop 3 is a great film. It's not. Robocop 1 was a great film, but R2 and R3 *are* good films in their own right, and a good Trilogy together. But there *are* drawbacks to it, starting with the budget. It's painfully obvious that this film was under-funded, proven by the sets, special effects, and that tiny actors in R1 have huge parts here. Also, while watered-down violence to make a film family-oriented isn't a bad thing, the violence here is a bit TOO watered-down. And last, Robocop went from cyborg killing machine to compassionate social worker too easily. Considering how many people he casually (though rightly) killed in the past, it would've been more appropriate if he had felt confused at the feeling of having an orphaned girl embrace him for comfort, rather than instantly knowing that he needs to gently place his hand on top of the back of her head.

She's a lawyer and decides to defend him herself but, knowing nothing of Courts Martial, she hired ex-drunk Morgan Freeman to help her. Some shady stuff follows, the charges are withdrawn, and hubby turns out to be guilty after all and tries to off her. That's about all I understood.I used to teach classes to Marines at New River Air Station and every other class or so, one of them would show up with a black eye. I finally mentioned this one night and a student asked, What does that tell you about the Marine Corps? The students told me a lot more about the Marine Corps than this movie does. According to the movie the Corps is made up of beefy ugly bruits with haircuts you wouldn't believe, blustering and pompous, but they melt away like Wusses before Ashley Judd's fierce determination.I really like Ashley Judd, by the way. She has a trim figure and a plump, pretty, asymmetrical and highly expressive face. Her left eyebrow is always cocked in disbelief. She has dark greenish irises that have a tendency to roll heavenward when she's exasperated. And she's a competent actress too when given the chance to act. I like Morgan Freeman too. His face is made of lumps, in profile his nose seems lopped off at the end, and in this film his hair is long and wooly and combed crazily backward, as befits a recovering alcoholic. And he's the soul of reliability. If I wanted a doctor or a lawyer I'd look him up in one big jiffy. He can even be a credible drunk. Amanda Peet is properly sluttish but not really necessary. Paul Caveziel as the husband looks the part of the tough Marine but doesn't carry his weight, or maybe it's partly that the role doesn't give him a chance.But -- well, then there's the plot. Forget about any sociopolitical comments on Special Ops in Central America. It's a murder mystery. All along we're led to believe along with Judd that the military is made up of a bunch of conniving morons and heavies. Dark cars and pickups follow Judd around.

He trusses her up and is about to kill her, although his expectations are unclear. What I mean is, hubby has just had charges of mass murder withdrawn. He hasn't been acquitted so he's still chargeable and under suspicion. And Morgan Freeman has just uncovered evidence that hubby is guilty. Freeman calls Judd and gives her the dope. Now hubby is about to shoot his wife in their own home because she knows he's a murderer, right? But meanwhile Freeman knows too. And there will be blood all over the place if he shoots his wife. What does he have to gain by killing her? Absolutely nothing. It's as if, at this point, the writers had thrown away the rest of the script and said, Let's stick in a woman-in-jeopardy climax.

I found myself enjoying every second, and found myself annoyed with a million things. And still enjoying it.The cinematography is stunning, it really captures that gray, damp, depressing atmosphere present in so many (if not all) parts of the north-west. The writing and a few of the performances bugged me however. A previous reviewer mentioned something about Van Sant being stuck with Matt Dillon and Kelly Lynch because they couldn't get anyone else. I could not agree more.Dillon was as stiff as ever, thinking that a low, whispered voice will make his performance seem real and gritty. It wont. The following is straight out of The Dillon 10 Steps To Acting Programme (TM) pamphletStep 1 Take a sip of tea. Slurp loudly to show people that you are a wild and loose & goosey method actor. Make sure the audience understand the tea is hot. They saw you boil water ten seconds ago, but they are idiots so they may have forgotten. Remind them.Step 2 Turn around in a slow, stiff manner. Look thoughtful.Step 3 Put down tea on table.Step 4 Turn back around. Stiffly.Step 5 Clear throat. Think realism.Step 6 Frown and look brooding. The character is oh so tortured, remember?Step 7 Wave hands around a bit. Y'know, like Chandler on Friends.Step 8 Stop waving. Don't wanna do too much. Gotta make it seem like it's all just coming to you right then and there, and that you're just mucking it up and improvising. You gotta make it look... uhhm... the word escapes me... I think the word is spontaneous, but I'm not sure because I am a male bimbo. I went to the library to look the word up, but for some reason I couldn't find spontaneous under the F section so I got bored and read one of the magazines instead. It had a funny picture of a chimp smoking a cigar. Oh how I laughed. Chimps rule. Corona Light rules too. Damn now I'm thirsty. Wait, what am I doing in a library? Hey look, there's a picture of a funny chimp in this magazine! Huh-huh-huh-huh! Is this a library?Step 9 Look up. Speak your line. Use a hoarse, husky voice and mumble a little bit. Just like that Brando Calrissian dude in that Streetcat With Designer movie.Step 10 Make sure there is a fifteen second pause between each step. You need these fifteen seconds to remind yourself of your next line, because the Dillon mind is not complicated enough to harbor more than one thought at any time. Give the thought plenty of time to leave to make space for the next one.Tada!The only time I've enjoyed a Matt Dillon performance was in There's Something About Mary, where his awkwardness worked as an advantage. Kelly Lynch didn't fare much better. I never believed Dillon and Lynch were addicts. Their acting just seemed like... well, acting (see the Ten Step Programme). I saw Dillon & Lynch running around playing addicts, much like a little children playing house. Sure they're cute as hell, but do you really believe for one second 4 year old Emma and 5 year old Timmy are mother and son? No. Lynch, much like Dillon, seems to think that uttering a line really slowly with a bored face will make them seem tough, arrogant and addict-like. They wont. It takes a real lack of talent to say the line F**k you, a**hole with no emotion what so ever. And no, it's not because she was playing an addict. It's because she doesn't know who to act.I will have to blame some of this on the writing though. Why exactly does almost every line the name of the person the character is talking to? Sure, Bob. Yeah, Bob. Why, Bob? Where are you going, Dianne? Where are you going, Rick? Screw you, Gentry, Screw you, Bob. Dianne, take your coat off. Dianne, stay for a while. Dianne, you look good. Get in the car, Rick. Put this in the car, Nadine. You know what, Dianne? Tom, it's Bob. How much speed do you have, David? Nadine, do you know what you've done? No, Bob.Who the hell talks like this? Makes you wonder if the writer has ever had one single conversation in his life. A little advice the audience knows the names of the characters already, no need to say it over and over. It's only insulting and annoying. Why didn't the actors mention this to Van Sant? Why did they accept such shoddy lines? Didn't they realize how phony it sounded? If not, it only makes me think even less of their acting abilities. Heather Graham (who admittedly didn't have much to do) and James LeGros were a little better. Not much, but a little. Probably because neither had a lot of lines, they just had to stand there and look stupid. They did that well.But still, I did enjoy it. Why? Because I had a lot of fun watching Matt Dillon's scenes and imagining how much better any actor in the world would have done them.

The character is oh so tortured, remember?Step 7 Wave hands around a bit. Y'know, like Chandler on Friends.Step 8 Stop waving. Don't wanna do too much. Gotta make it seem like it's all just coming to you right then and there, and that you're just mucking it up and improvising. You gotta make it look... uhhm... the word escapes me... I think the word is spontaneous, but I'm not sure because I am a male bimbo. I went to the library to look the word up, but for some reason I couldn't find spontaneous under the F section so I got bored and read one of the magazines instead. It had a funny picture of a chimp smoking a cigar. Oh how I laughed. Chimps rule. Corona Light rules too. Damn now I'm thirsty. Wait, what am I doing in a library? Hey look, there's a picture of a funny chimp in this magazine! Huh-huh-huh-huh! Is this a library?Step 9 Look up. Speak your line. Use a hoarse, husky voice and mumble a little bit. Just like that Brando Calrissian dude in that Streetcat With Designer movie.Step 10 Make sure there is a fifteen second pause between each step. You need these fifteen seconds to remind yourself of your next line, because the Dillon mind is not complicated enough to harbor more than one thought at any time. Give the thought plenty of time to leave to make space for the next one.Tada!The only time I've enjoyed a Matt Dillon performance was in There's Something About Mary, where his awkwardness worked as an advantage. Kelly Lynch didn't fare much better. I never believed Dillon and Lynch were addicts. Their acting just seemed like... well, acting (see the Ten Step Programme). I saw Dillon & Lynch running around playing addicts, much like a little children playing house. Sure they're cute as hell, but do you really believe for one second 4 year old Emma and 5 year old Timmy are mother and son? No. Lynch, much like Dillon, seems to think that uttering a line really slowly with a bored face will make them seem tough, arrogant and addict-like. They wont. It takes a real lack of talent to say the line F**k you, a**hole with no emotion what so ever. And no, it's not because she was playing an addict. It's because she doesn't know who to act.I will have to blame some of this on the writing though. Why exactly does almost every line the name of the person the character is talking to? Sure, Bob. Yeah, Bob. Why, Bob? Where are you going, Dianne? Where are you going, Rick? Screw you, Gentry, Screw you, Bob. Dianne, take your coat off. Dianne, stay for a while. Dianne, you look good. Get in the car, Rick. Put this in the car, Nadine. You know what, Dianne? Tom, it's Bob. How much speed do you have, David? Nadine, do you know what you've done? No, Bob.Who the hell talks like this? Makes you wonder if the writer has ever had one single conversation in his life. A little advice the audience knows the names of the characters already, no need to say it over and over. It's only insulting and annoying. Why didn't the actors mention this to Van Sant? Why did they accept such shoddy lines? Didn't they realize how phony it sounded? If not, it only makes me think even less of their acting abilities. Heather Graham (who admittedly didn't have much to do) and James LeGros were a little better. Not much, but a little. Probably because neither had a lot of lines, they just had to stand there and look stupid. They did that well.But still, I did enjoy it. Why? Because I had a lot of fun watching Matt Dillon's scenes and imagining how much better any actor in the world would have done them.

He's more of a Broadway actor anyway, but when we get a chance to see him on celluloid, it sure is a treat. Needless to say, he is more than enjoyable here. But he's not the only one who puts on a marvelous performance. Pfeiffer, Thurman, and Close all do very respectable jobs in this lustful tale of deceit and revenge. However, I must say that although she performed well, Glenn Close seems fairly miscast. Why? Because she's supposed to be this unattainable beauty and simply irresistible to Valmont (Malkovich), but she simply couldn't give a desperate man a stiffy. The part required someone of timeless beauty which she does not have, in my opinion. To be honest, she scares the living sh*t out of me.What we have is an original tale of lust, power and deceit rolled up into a film of excellent entertainment and quality. A little seedy for some, however, I enjoyed it quite well. Close and Malkovich's behavior, in character, sometimes made me want to slap them and sometimes give them a high five. Very effective. Respectively, while you're meant to feel sorry for some of the characters, you can't help but to root for the evildoers as well.  The costumes and sets are very impressive and are completely convincing. And for once, I don't really have anything bad to say about Keanu Reeves. He plays a tool, so he fits the bill perfectly. Overall, a very entertaining and decent movie, even if it's not really my forte or one of my all time favorites. Pig alert, see this movie if you want to see Umabreasts! Yes, it's an official word.

It pains me that even after so many years people are still complaining about this movie. Now, I can understand fans being a bit disappointed back in 1992. I mean hell, James Cameron's ALIENS was an utter triumph. It basically broke the curse dooming sequels into being nothing more than inferior insults.Nevertheless, it is wholly unfair to judge ALIEN 3 against its successful predecessor. So many viewers walked away saying No guns? Blah! You can't have an ALIEN film without guns. Now please, that is just ridiculous. Cameron's sequel introduced guns into the equation. The original (and widely popular) ALIEN was a science fiction fright flick with no guns.The problem that Cameron created with making a great sequel is that now how is another film going to top it? Perhaps it can be done, just look at the challenges Cameron himself faced when he first announced he wanted to make a sequel to ALIEN. Everyone told him 'no' and that it would end his career. Hmm.Nonetheless, Cameron made it remarkably difficult for a new film and director to step up to the plate. On top of that, the studio (FOX) made the equation damn-near impossible. There were literally hundreds of scripts and treatments for a third ALIEN film. Ideas and plots eventually snow-balled into a conglomerate mess as production started. There were even teaser trailers released indicating the aliens reaching earth (an early version of the script) which ultimately contradicts the film that was made.Enter a talented young man named David Fincher, perhaps best known for his background in music videos. Fincher takes the job as his feature film debut, most likely with high hopes. Production starts as no official script is completed and later filming begins even as new rewrites are being added. Fincher eventually abandons the film (before completion) citing studio interference and officially disowns it. What's left of the disaster is edited together (complete with even more reshooting) and released to an already skeptical fanbase.I only learned of the production debacle years later and began to understand why Fincher would ignore the film completely. It must be a bizarre fluke that the film turned out as well as it did. I can only assume the film's integrity stems from Fincher's involvement. ALIEN 3 made me take notice of this director's name and sure enough he soon did receive the success he deserved with his next film SEVEN (1995).Now, with all of this in mind one might dismiss ALIEN 3 as utter sh**. I disagree. I saw the film opening weekend in the summer of 1992 and loved it. And it still today is my favorite entry in the series.ALIEN 3 departs from the previous two films by creating a dark, violent, philosophical drama of mythological proportions. This film introduces a new aesthetic, beautiful in all its stygian richness. Gone are the grim air ducts and technological trappings of the first two films. Instead, Ripley awakens in an inescapable hell deep in the nothingness of space - a labyrinth world of golden light, thick escaping steam, and lost souls. She's crash landed (with the xenomorph onboard) into an abandoned prison planet inhabited by an all-male population of murderers and rapists.The plot is incredibly rich with drama in that Ripley finds herself with no hope. She is inescapably attached to this alien and it will forever destroy her life. And it is here, in this purgatory of sorts, where she finds the courage to finish it once and for all. Of course, Elliot Goldenthal's magnificent score helps as does Fincher's visual metaphors (most notably the funeral scene) and overall style.

I recently watched it again and took away some new feelings, while revisiting some old ones.Depp is great in this movie, he plays his character half sane, half with-it. He is extremely soft spoken and communicates mostly through imitations of slapstick comedy routines, aping Chaplin, Keaton(Buster), among the more well known. In this way it comments on silent film. Though the film is a talkie, the love shared between Sam and Joon Pearl, is a silent yet deep one, cooked under the warmth of an iron. The movie is also the dramatization of collage, thus invoking dada, surrealism, fluxus, and various 20th\/21st century art movements \/ techniques. Playing cards for random house-hold items, and of course SAM's entire character and existence in this narrative, are case in point. As a performer, one learns how to cut, flip, spin, collage, and imitate (copy... think xerox)...

For the first time since he won it back in 1952 in the Korean War Raymond really felt that he earned it, and so did everyone else in the theater watching the movie.Raymond never really felt right with that medal and disliked having to wear it he felt that he didn't earn it and that everything about his war record was false. Saving nine fellow GI's from the Communist Chinese by whom they were held captive and also wiping out a North Korean and Communist Chinese patrol as the GI's under his leadership fought their way back across the border into South Korea was more then enough for Raymond to get the Medal of Honor but something deep inside his mind told him it was a lie. But this time there was nothing at all phony about what Raymond did. He saved the United States from a covert Communist takeover, but by doing that it cost Raymond his life.Powerful Cold War thriller that never lost it's punch since it's release back in 1962 with it's story about an attempt to overthrow and take over the United States government from within. Super American patriot and closet USSR & Communist Chinese collaborator Mrs. Iselin, Angela Lansbury, is positioning her drunken and buffoonish husband, and her son Raymond's step-father, Sen. John Johnny Iselin, James Gregory, to become President of the United States. Mrs. Iselin first plans to get Johnny nominated Vice President and then have the president of the party out of office assassinated which will catapult Johnny into the White House due to the sympathetic and emotional volcano that would erupt all over the country following that tragic event. Secretly working with the Soviet Union for ten years Mrs. Iselin has used her position as Sen. Iselin's wife and head of some fifteen American Patriotic organizations where she is now within reach of her goals. But Mrs. Iselin has other ideas about what she'll do as the power behind her husband the future President Iselin when he takes office. Resenting both the Soviet Union and Communist China Mrs. Iselin didn't forget what they did in making her beloved and only son an instrument of murder to achieve their aims. And even worse treating her with disrespect and not as an equal she'll make sure that they won't forget that either. Mrs. Iselin maniacally plans to use the full force of the US military to destroy those two Communist powers, for what they did to Raymond and how they treated her, in a Third World War. The Manchurian Candidate starts out with a bad dream and ends with an awakened and walking nightmare with a double-assassination and suicide at the Presidential Nominating Convention at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

There are many sides to Holly Golightly (love the name), as her friend Paul (George Peppard) discovers, many surprises and many disappointments. Even though this 1961 film has typical corn to it, it is so cool to watch. My husband especially loves the opening scene, the wonderful mood of it, the ambiance of Holly walking around a deserted early-morning New York City street, munching on a pretzel, wearing the height of fashion evening gown and jewels, gazing in the window at Tiffany's. The cool 60's taxis, the bathtub sofa, the outrageous fashions, and of course, my favorite, the handsome fat orange tabby cat with no name.

As soon as he got the part Dalton went straight back to the source material..ie Ian Fleming's novels & it shows on the screen...the bond in the Living Daylights is the Bond character jumping right out of the books.The film really shows how keen everyone involved in it wanted to say that this was a fresh start but at the same time still show that this is a Bond picture & they pull it off very well..John Glen's direction is excellent,he really found his feet by now & all the aspects of the film are done well...A special mention must also go to John Barry who's score for the film is one of his best...oh if only they couyd bring him back rather than have his clone do the new ones....Timothy Dalton is very much undervalued in his contribution to the Bond movies but i do feel that in about 10 years & his films will be seen in a different light on how they are looked on today. The producers of the Bond movies really need to do the same again now as they did back in 1987...make Bond a character & no more films like Die Another Day..OK it made them tons of money but is it worth selling the sole of Bond to do it.....

Anyway, I'll try to...Woody Allen has made some superb movies (Hannah And Her Sisters, Annie Hall, Manhattan Murder Mistery...), some great movies (Other Woman, Sleeper, Broadway Danny Rose...), and some good movies (Celebrity, Deconstructing Harry, Everything You Wanted...). Well, Alice belongs to the third group (in my opinion). Alice is not a drama itself just like Other Woman or Interiors (the Bergman-influenced filmography from Mr. Allen), it's not a crazy comedy like Bananas, Sleeper, or Take The Money And Run, and defineteley it's not one of his well-known intelectual-high-class comedies just like Annie Hall, Manhattan, or Mighty Aphrodite etc... But it certainly has traces of each and every one of those. The main problem with Alice is that Woody doesn't appear in the movie and that's always bad news. Though he does not appear in a couple of his best movies (Bullets Over Broadway, Sweet and Lowdown), there's no doubt that Woody Allen's fans want him to be on the screen. He's just like Groucho Marx it doesn't matter that much what the story is about, nor if it's original or interesting, because if Woody is on the screen I don't care about the rest. Anyway, Alice is not as good as his best films simply because the dialogues are not as brilliant as usual, the story is a little bit hackneyed...which it wouldn't matter, as I said, if the dialogues were as sharp as always, and if Woody were on the film playing his usual character. But they aren't, a he is not.Ok, let's talk about Alice's story Alice (Mia Forrow) is an unsatisfied and bored woman married to a filthy rich man (William Hurt). Her life is quite simple pickin' her boys from the school, go shopping, hairdresser, masseur, etc.. So she meets this jazz player performed by Joe Mantegna and she falls in love with him. From that moment on we'll witness all her doubts, remorse, etc. She also visits a chinese acupuncturist in order to ease some kind of pain in her back (all psychosomatic, as we'll discover) who will prescribe her all kind of strange medicinal herbs (or not so medicinal -you'll see what I'm talking about if you watch the movie-). Those sequences at acunpuncturist's surgery are some of the more funny of the movie.  There're also some fantastic and paranormal passages (just like in Purple Rose From Cairo), most of them provoked (I guess) by the medicinal herbs.I don't like Mia Farrow that much, but she's ok playing her typical role of a shy-timid-submissive woman. Besides, she's the absolute starring here. Joe Mantegna and William Hurt are two of the best actors from their generation, so they're always fine (even if they work in a bad movie). And the music is just great (Woody's good taste for music is  beyond all doubt).My rate 6.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 August 2004","score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  *Warning Woody Allen is one of my idols, so don't you expect me to be much objective about him.
