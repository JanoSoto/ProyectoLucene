A decade later I decided to pop the movie in and give it another go. Yep, I still feel the same! Love the movie, love the makeup and costuming, love the themes discussed and by all means, love the cliff hanger Tim Burton uses in the end. I have all kinds of love for this movie. Seems like Tim Burton had a vision of more movies in the Ape regime; sadly for some of us it just did not see its way through due to the entire mixed acceptance back in 2001. Tim Burton as all you readers are aware is quite unorthodox and eccentric in his directorial choices. For those of you who are not as familiar as some of us, he gave us Alice In Wonderland , Sweeney Todd, Corpse Bride, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Sleepy Hallow & Edward Scissor Hands to name a few. If you are a reader who follows movies not by trailer but by director, 8 out of 10 have watched all of the above. Planet of the Apes with comparison to Burton's style is quite different. It's a Sci Fi that discuss themes of Animal Cruelty, Humans vs Nature and also if you want to be scoffer who hates this movie, a remake of classic Sci Fi from 1968. I respect classics, however what if I can watch it done slightly better. The costuming and make up is brilliant in comparison to the classic. However my intention is not to compare this with the reputed classic. 5 Stars and a round of applause for the magnificent work put in by the team with the makeup and costuming. For a movie made a decade ago this is brilliant, I have watched movies done in the past 2 years that can't even hold a candle to this effort. There is a lot of emotion that is required to be conveyed, which was a vital element to carry out the emotional wave. Giving the extra advantage of excellent facial movement makes it so realistic, never would I have for a moment felt, it is false and it is just a movie. I was right there in the middle of it all. Thumbs up yet again! As much as I respect Mark Wahlbergs performance, I have to side with Tim Roth on this one. Bold performance! The ferocity, the valor, the true determination to make every human suffer he nailed it all. Tim Roth although under so much of makeup, has his presence; he is just scared to look at. He is the meanest Ape I have seen so far. Helena Bonham Carter, who later marries director Burton in real life, was convincing and also was the vital link that ties human affection and animal cruelty on a broader perspective. Personally though I felt that Carter has so much more potential is capable of contributing more. (But wait! Am I comparing her to who she has become before she became?)We do not realize what it is like to be caged, or to be treated as pets or even as beasts, but seems like there is much to fathom from this, animals feel as much as we do. These are lessons for some of us who beat our pets up, or for those who don't leave a clean bowl of water for your dog every day. Doesn't look too great when the tables are turned does it? Also we humans don't realize that once done, certain things can never be undone (You have to watch the movie till the end to understand this). Wahlberg clearly states in the movie that we humans hurt each other way more than we hurt animals on his home planet? Have you ever stopped to think how true that it is? With such beautiful themes that are very well deeply hidden it disheartens me that this movie never got the place it rightfully still deserves. A decade is a long time, but the copies are still out there.

It's a film that reconciles the public with the idea that men can also be targeted by the evolution of society, consumption society that advertises the image of clean-cut faces and muscular bodies with the same zealous marketing as for women's tits and sexy legs. Average men suffer from a tacit rejection, because basically, every time, their women, or for that matter, the women they'd like to be with, are confronted to messages indirectly shouting They are unemployed, ugly, lazy, they are losers. The Full Monty is a comedic response to a very serious social issue and the kindheartedness of the film proves that humor sometimes can be the best weapon to deal with rejection.Comedic tones still have these particularities that they're not meant to be taken seriously, but I think what makes the best comedies is precisely the ability to make people laugh and move them at the same time. Even screwball comedies can be exasperating if they don't let you catch your breath and appreciate some sensitivity. And this is the strength of The Full Monty, being able to tell us very touching separate stories that will all converge to a same need having a job, making money, being respected. I said 'respected' and not 'admired' because 'admiration' would be taking itself too seriously and the suspension of disbelief wouldn't work. The stories are centered on three men who all used to work in the steel factory which is to Sheffield (England) what the Nuclear Power Plant is to The Simpsons' Springfield, before the economical crisis, before unemployment, a problem still relevant today.Robert Carlyle, who played the demented Begbie in Trainspotting is in a totally opposite role as the leader of the group, Gaz, who'll encourage his buddies to 'do it', to prove that they're not an endangered species, that they are the real men. Mark Addy is Dave, his best friend, a lovable teddy bear of a guy who doesn't trust his wife, not even himself, he's the kind of character you want to put near you just to show him the film and how people really think about him, he could have been annoying if he didn't have so many qualities, among them, loyalty, kindness and a heart as big as his belly. And Gerald is the older and wiser man, who supervised them in the factory before unemployment. He's the one who practices dance and can help to produce the miracle. Three more men will join the group, and the only one to know about the secret is Nathan, Gaz's son, his inspiration to show that he's better than what her mother, and her new husband say. The film doesn't avoid some stereotypical situations but it would be unfair to criticize that, since the newness relies on the show these guys will do, the Chippendales, and no other movie did that before. And even when Chippendales did it, it wasn't The Full Monty.And no other movie dealt with male nudity, with sexiness, with Hot Stuff in a light-hearted tone. The script is surely one of the movie's main strengths, because the strip-tease aspect is only a plot device, the point is elsewhere, it's about proving value. I won't develop that subject because all I need is to copy-paste everything I said about Rocky, but there's indeed a Rocky feeling in this picture, where the prize to win is respect and self-respect. And this creates a double empathy from male public first, but also women who can finally see their men, boyfriends as the unsung heroes of everyday's life. I loved David with his girl, Jeannie, they were not particularly handsome, but there was a genuine love going between them. Gee, I would have loved to see them after the show, if this movie was 5 minutes longer, just something of the aftermath, but I guess their satisfactions and the cheers of the public had enough eloquence.And let's not forget that this is still a comedy, and the whole preparation of the show lead to so many memorable scenes especially the one in the Agency, where all the guys tap their feet to Donna Summer's iconic rhythm, probably one of the most gimmicky scenes of the 90's, not to mention the hilarious scenes that kept enough class not to reach certain limits. Where other movies would have probably displayed nude images, old women screaming, or other distastefully displays of raunchy humor, The Full Monty tackles it with a gentleness, that probably helped the film to reach a wider audience, be a popular success, and nominated to the Oscars. Definitely, one of the best of the 90's!

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music"},{"date":"9 June 2011","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" After the failure that was Rocky V, Sylvester Stallone was officially off the A-list and tried his hand at comedy. But it was a failure for him, being reduced to an atrocious movie with Estelle Getty as well as a movie that is named after the most coveted prize in acting Oscar. Cliffhanger got him back into the game, though only for a brief shining moment. It pretty much all ended with Judge Dredd and Daylight, both substantial failures in many aspects. But I believe that it was The Specialist that sort of started the downfall for Stallone after a successful year in 1993. While it technically counts as a hit, so many things go wrong in it.Departing from over the top solo efforts, The Specialist tries to steer Stallone in a different direction in this slightly erotic but mostly derivative revenge thriller. Twists and mayhem ensue, yet it never quite does much for us to be honest. 10 years after a bombing that gets him kicked out of the CIA, Bomb expert Ray Quick (Stallone) is in Miami waiting for his next targets on the orders of May Munro (Sharon Stone), who wants revenge on the men that killed her parents when she was a child. The men are made up of the Leon family in Joe (Rod Steiger) and Tomas (Eric Roberts), both who are vicious and cold blooded to May.Old friend turned enemy Ned Trent (James Woods) overlooks the situation, though he knows that Ray can kill just about anybody without really trying. While killing some associates of the Leons, Ray gets a little too close for comfort for May and soon becomes personally attached to her past. Despite accomplishing the necessary killings, it isn't quite over for Ray and May, who still have to deal with Ned before they can get away. Plus, one of them is not telling the truth to the other, so it will be a matter of who gets who in the end.The Specialist hardly represents the worst of Stallone, but it's closer to the bottom than the top to be honest. An unusual film even for Stallone, The Specialist is darker and more subdued for the typical Stallone film. Sadly, that's where the film loses us in trying to rebuild Stallone's image despite him retaining muscles for a role that definitely didn't need it other than one erotic but hopelessly pointless scene. Moody but cheesy, The Specialist tries hard to be a throwback revenge film but ends up getting tangled into too many webs and doesn't deliver the necessary thrills.Surprisingly based on a series of novels, I'd have to imagine that the novels at least seem more interesting than this joyless action picture. For what the film tries to be in a dramatic thriller, the end result makes it cheesy and depressingly routine for Stallone. The script mostly plays like a series of puzzles that never seem to make sense, though the film tries hard to fit them. The only enjoyment you'll get is the many ways that Stallone kills his targets, which sadly provide only some pleasure when they pop up. Without those bits of overkill, The Specialist is an empty spectacle full of fireworks but no thrills.The screenplay wants us to buy into the various twists and turns, but eventually they'll leave your head either shaking or sleepy, though it wouldn't matter because the script runs out of ideas halfway through. When the movie goes through its targets, it's as if The Specialist seemed to stall and just wanted to end with even more fireworks than shown before. Eventually, it gets tedious to get to a finale that sadly is as big of a letdown as seeing James Woods and Rod Steiger being conned into a film made for Stallone and Stone. Woods does his best to inject the movie with life, but even his hammy performance can't cover his lack of enthusiasm for the role.Woods chews the scenery and rarely gives it back &#x96; that is until Stallone comes into the picture. His lack of conviction hurts his role greatly, giving us a character that looks good on paper but often seems underwhelming and lackluster. Stallone distances himself from being a macho action hero in The Specialist, yet the look on his face makes you think otherwise. He gives us enough mystery to give us an occasionally interesting character, but even he can't hide his muscles from becoming a distraction. The lack of background story on him makes us even less interested, not to mention that Stallone isn't what he used to be.Stone fits the manipulative woman well, but that's a role she's been known for her whole career. She certainly has the body and looks, but she doesn't have the brains to pull off a part that Kathleen Turner did well in Body Heat. While her intentions are modest, it's the plan in action that makes Stone's character less than believable. Steiger is more hammy than Woods here, yet he seems less interesting because he becomes irrelevant in the long run. Roberts either seems too old or too beat up to pull off the beautiful tough guy, lacking any sense of morality and becomes a distraction for The Specialist.Some of the action pieces can be fun, but since they aren't the focus of The Specialist, they seem less than stimulating to be honest. A few exhilarating moments are negated by bad twists, dull characters and an atmosphere that's more tacky than mysterious. I suppose setting the film in Miami had something to with it, for it seems that the cast had more fun off the set than on it. Barry's music is better fit for a romantic drama, not something as mysterious or dull as The Specialist amounts to be. The Specialist gives a few cheap thrills, but it simply never does much for its characters or atmosphere.Grade D+ ","genre":null},{"date":"9 June 2011","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" After the failure that was Rocky V, Sylvester Stallone was officially off the A-list and tried his hand at comedy.

Despite accomplishing the necessary killings, it isn't quite over for Ray and May, who still have to deal with Ned before they can get away. Plus, one of them is not telling the truth to the other, so it will be a matter of who gets who in the end.The Specialist hardly represents the worst of Stallone, but it's closer to the bottom than the top to be honest. An unusual film even for Stallone, The Specialist is darker and more subdued for the typical Stallone film. Sadly, that's where the film loses us in trying to rebuild Stallone's image despite him retaining muscles for a role that definitely didn't need it other than one erotic but hopelessly pointless scene. Moody but cheesy, The Specialist tries hard to be a throwback revenge film but ends up getting tangled into too many webs and doesn't deliver the necessary thrills.Surprisingly based on a series of novels, I'd have to imagine that the novels at least seem more interesting than this joyless action picture. For what the film tries to be in a dramatic thriller, the end result makes it cheesy and depressingly routine for Stallone. The script mostly plays like a series of puzzles that never seem to make sense, though the film tries hard to fit them. The only enjoyment you'll get is the many ways that Stallone kills his targets, which sadly provide only some pleasure when they pop up. Without those bits of overkill, The Specialist is an empty spectacle full of fireworks but no thrills.The screenplay wants us to buy into the various twists and turns, but eventually they'll leave your head either shaking or sleepy, though it wouldn't matter because the script runs out of ideas halfway through. When the movie goes through its targets, it's as if The Specialist seemed to stall and just wanted to end with even more fireworks than shown before. Eventually, it gets tedious to get to a finale that sadly is as big of a letdown as seeing James Woods and Rod Steiger being conned into a film made for Stallone and Stone. Woods does his best to inject the movie with life, but even his hammy performance can't cover his lack of enthusiasm for the role.Woods chews the scenery and rarely gives it back &#x96; that is until Stallone comes into the picture. His lack of conviction hurts his role greatly, giving us a character that looks good on paper but often seems underwhelming and lackluster. Stallone distances himself from being a macho action hero in The Specialist, yet the look on his face makes you think otherwise. He gives us enough mystery to give us an occasionally interesting character, but even he can't hide his muscles from becoming a distraction. The lack of background story on him makes us even less interested, not to mention that Stallone isn't what he used to be.Stone fits the manipulative woman well, but that's a role she's been known for her whole career. She certainly has the body and looks, but she doesn't have the brains to pull off a part that Kathleen Turner did well in Body Heat. While her intentions are modest, it's the plan in action that makes Stone's character less than believable. Steiger is more hammy than Woods here, yet he seems less interesting because he becomes irrelevant in the long run. Roberts either seems too old or too beat up to pull off the beautiful tough guy, lacking any sense of morality and becomes a distraction for The Specialist.Some of the action pieces can be fun, but since they aren't the focus of The Specialist, they seem less than stimulating to be honest. A few exhilarating moments are negated by bad twists, dull characters and an atmosphere that's more tacky than mysterious. I suppose setting the film in Miami had something to with it, for it seems that the cast had more fun off the set than on it. Barry's music is better fit for a romantic drama, not something as mysterious or dull as The Specialist amounts to be. The Specialist gives a few cheap thrills, but it simply never does much for its characters or atmosphere.Grade D+ ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"9 June 2011","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" After the failure that was Rocky V, Sylvester Stallone was officially off the A-list and tried his hand at comedy. But it was a failure for him, being reduced to an atrocious movie with Estelle Getty as well as a movie that is named after the most coveted prize in acting Oscar. Cliffhanger got him back into the game, though only for a brief shining moment. It pretty much all ended with Judge Dredd and Daylight, both substantial failures in many aspects. But I believe that it was The Specialist that sort of started the downfall for Stallone after a successful year in 1993. While it technically counts as a hit, so many things go wrong in it.Departing from over the top solo efforts, The Specialist tries to steer Stallone in a different direction in this slightly erotic but mostly derivative revenge thriller. Twists and mayhem ensue, yet it never quite does much for us to be honest. 10 years after a bombing that gets him kicked out of the CIA, Bomb expert Ray Quick (Stallone) is in Miami waiting for his next targets on the orders of May Munro (Sharon Stone), who wants revenge on the men that killed her parents when she was a child. The men are made up of the Leon family in Joe (Rod Steiger) and Tomas (Eric Roberts), both who are vicious and cold blooded to May.Old friend turned enemy Ned Trent (James Woods) overlooks the situation, though he knows that Ray can kill just about anybody without really trying.

Not the biggest fan in the world, but I certainly enjoy his style. However, I had heard that this movie was a stinker, so I decided to give it a pass for a while. When I did get around to seeing it, I was blown away. 1. The acting. The acting was superb. Robert Carlyle was excellent as Daffy. Both french actors (Virginie Ledoyen and Guilliaume Canet) were solid. DiCaprio was great. One review I read accuses him of playing a nobody but I assure you that this is exactly why he was so brilliantly cast. He's an American twenty-something on vacation in Thailand. He is unsure of himself and he is capable. He doesn't know what he wants or why he's here. DiCaprio plays this part perfectly, acting both unsure and overconfident. Tilda Swin is perfect as the leader of a small island community. 2. Storytelling. This movie is really hard to place. It starts out as a finding oneself type film with some thriller elements. It ends up... somewhere I did not expect it to go. THe story follows a windy road full of twists and turns, and takes the viewer to places he had no intention of going. It should also be mentioned that this film is fairly similar to Apocalypse Now (Boyle's Favorite Film). This movie is also funny. I wasn't expecting that either. There are moments (very few, actually) of fun and play in this overall rather dark story. 3. Score, editing, cinematography, etc. When I watch a Danny Boyle film, I am always reminded of the other films he's made, both stylistically and thematically. Despite using different cinematographers, his films invariably have a specific visual style (much more apparent in his later films) with angled camera, and rich blues, yellows and greens. In many ways, this film reminded me a little of Trainspotting crossed with 127 Hours. It's less flashy than one, and more than the other, and deals with some similar elements of trial that are present 127 Hours, as well as an interesting cast of characters, like Trainspotting. Both films have at least one hallucination\/insanity moment, but I will not go too far down that road for fear of uncovering spoilers. The score was fine, I felt it fit the film rather well, giving it the flashy wildness of the 2000 without going overboard. Most of the soundtrack has a kind of retro synth feel combined with a more modern beat. Not the best music on the planet, but nothing to lose sleep over. Anyways, I could go more in depth about specific story elements, plot devices and scene structures, but I won't for brevity's sake. But, to sum up my review I loved it. At many points during the film I found myself thinking this is such a good movie. Don't listen to the bad reviews. this is completely worth watching.

Life is easily one of Eddie Murphy's better movies outside of the Shrek movie line, and let's face it, outside of Shrek, Eddie doesn't really have such a strong resume of decent films, but Life is an exception. Now before I really go in depth with this review, let me point out that Life isn't your typical straight off the assembly line buddy flick, despite what the advertising for this film suggests; this movie has a very serious undertone which at times turns to an overtone and it's armed with razor sharp teeth. With that in mind let's dive right in! Life is told in flashback by an elderly prisoner talking to two younger prisoners about the fast talking pick pocket Ray Gibson (Eddie Murphy) and serious would-be bank teller Claude Banks (Martin Lawrence). In 1932, both Ray and Claude were in debt to a loan shark named Spanky. In order to pay off Spanky, both men agreed to travel from New York to Mississippi to pick up moonshine and take it back with them. However, while in Mississippi, Ray and Claude are wrongfully accused of murdering a man Ray previously lost out to in a card game. Both men are then sentenced to life in prison. While time passes and the decades roll by, Ray and Claude must come to terms with their life sentence and each other.As the polar opposites of each other, Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence have great chemistry as the lead roles. The supporting cast are all good too and the dialogue is crisp and sharp. The make up effects are amazing as well. Until now make up in movies something that I have never talked about in any of my reviews, but here I couldn't help but mention it. Instead of getting elderly actors for the older versions of Ray and Claude, we still have Eddie and Martin but with excellent make up effects done on them; they genuinely look like they've aged for the worse in prison! If you ever have the chance to watch Life, be it on TV or renting it from a friend or video store, please do so.Final Score 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 June 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I have just finished watching Life and let me tell you something, it is worth watching.
