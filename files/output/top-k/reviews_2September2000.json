And you still leave the theater thinking that it is not a great film. Good, yes. But not something masterful or unforgettable. As a film based on a real story, THE PERFECT STORM doesn't take you to another world, but takes you to a showing of the complete fury of nature, something you had never seen before. Wow! If you want special effects, this film is for you. The scenes are so realistic that you feel you are on the storm with the fishermen. Water, water and water. Computers... What would we be without them? Well, a film like THE PERFECT STORM simply wouldn't exist. Director Wolfgang Petersen and the special effects creators should be applauded for such an amazing work as this. The audience liked and the film earned more than big hits as GLADIATOR and WHAT LIES BENEATH on its first weekend. And (what is better) lowing Mel Gibson's ego with THE PATRIOT.THE PERFECT STORM has more qualities (effective acting, a well prepared director, good tension), but has also problems. 1- The beginning is kind of slow and cliched. I know its objective is to introduce the characters, but it could have been less talkative and sentimental. 2- Some situations aren't needed. In fact, two of them the scene where the shark attacks Whalberg and the one where John C. Reilly is pulled by the fishing line, and the guys have to save him from drowning.

I would call them bi-dimensional characters. They change their way of thinking or their way of acting in a blink of eyes. Taking those three problems, THE PERFECT STORM is a good film. As I said, I loved the realism  and the tension of the second half. George Clooney, Mark Whalberg and John C. Reilly on the sea, and Diane Lane and the families on ground help to keep the emotions vivid. Many people complained that the ending is too sentimental, but oddly I liked it.

This film is not a film about football; it is a film about Oliver Stone.  With `Any Given Sunday', Stone has created his most ambitious tribute to his own megalomania.  This film is a classic example of excessive style negating substance.  Stone was so intent on showing us the sizzle, that he cooked all of the flavor out of the steak.  A good director uses innovative technique to enhance the telling of the story.  An egomaniac uses the story as an excuse to show off his talent and creativity.  The result of such self-indulgence is almost always a diminishment of the final product.Here Stone tries to out-hip the hip generation of directors by providing a staccato progression of weird angles, extreme close-ups and disjointed perspective shots with so many jump cuts that it makes `The Limey' look like it is on tranquilizers.  I have never seen so much dialogue delivered by actors with half their heads cut off.  The hand held football sequences were dreadful; as cameras were pounded into the turf without regard to the action that we were supposed to be following.  The entire movie was like a three-hour music video, with images flitting willy-nilly as if they were being shot by a drunken mosquito.  Ironically, Stone failed to learn the lesson learned by Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx) in the story; that is that the good of the whole is more important than the glory of the individual.It is a pity, because buried beneath all this decadent directorial tripe, there was a good sports story and some terrific acting.  We saw how money and greed adulterates the sport and how athletes too often become selfish and conceited as they bask in the limelight.  There was also the drama of the comeback in the critical game, which was dissipated by Stone's erratic camera work and editing.Al Pacino gave a great performance as the legendary coach past his prime, who let his pride stand in the way of the team's success.  Cameron Diaz rose above her accustomed quirky lightweight roles to deliver a stunning performance as the hard-as-nails club owner trying to move out of her dead father's shadow.  Jamie Foxx was electric as the third string quarterback who explodes into the public eye and begins taking himself far too seriously, evoking the ire of his teammates.This film had a great cast and a solid story that was marred by a narcissistic director who rendered it annoying to watch.  I rated it a 5\/10.  It's a shame, because I love sports stories and I never got a chance to enjoy this one.

But the one I liked the most (until maybe the last scene) was Amanda Peet.  She has a charm that is all her own, like cameron Diaz had in There's Something About Mary.  And she is pretty good through the whole movie, until the last scene, where she shows her true colors as a woman with all the integrity of all 4 lead women in Sex and the City.  The only difference being that in Sex and the City It's a chick show because it focuses on the women and there needs.  This film is actually mainly a guy film that they can relate to, except that the end can kinda give a guy some low-self esteem (especially after the outcome).

Many criticised this film because it did not follow the book, or omitted one thing or another.  That is all well and good, but what feature-length film *can* capture the entire scope of a novel the size of Anna Karenina?  I watched the older version with Greta Garbo and--though I cannot imagine why--it never truly caught my attention.  This version, however, captured me from the start.  And I am usually the first one to complain about what is wrong with a remake in comparison to the old version.  A paradox, indeed.This film first caught my eye because of Sophie Marceau.  I admire her immensely as an actress, having seen her in several films, both French and English.  Then, I recognised Bernard Rose as the director of Immortal Beloved, a film I had enjoyed some months before, mostly due to a magnificent performance by Gary Oldman, some of the most glorious music caught on film.The music, I can probably cite as one of the main reasons I loved this film.  I can think of no better love theme for a doomed romance like that of Anna and Vronsky, than the first movement of Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony.  The use of Swan Lake at various points was also wonderful, and the interplay during the scene at the ballet held me mesmerised.  Vronsky speaks of Anna being trapped in her marriage as the Prince seeks to capture the Swan Queen.  Perhaps I'm just rambling, but somehow that connected.On the whole, the performances were good.  Sophie Marceau was perfectly believable as Anna, and some of her scenes sent chills down my spine, though my favourite performance of hers still has to be Firelight.  Sean Bean had me worried for a few seconds, with a mannered reading or two, but improved quickly as the film progressed.  Another reviewer pointed out that Vronsky was meant to be a shallower character than Anna, and now that I think back on it, I believe that is very true, and that Sean Bean's performance reflected this superficiality.  Mia Kirshner was adequate--I didn't particularly care for her--but Alfred Molina and James Fox both gave fine performances (a standout for me was when Anna wrote Karenin from Italy and Karenin wavered before refusing to let her see Sergei).However, equally on par with the actors, was the setting.  Very few films, I have to admit, can look *so* beautiful.  Especially the ballroom scene, with the seemingly neverending hallway of gilded doors, the location photography was spectacular.  The costumes were stunning, and the cinematography made even snow seem alive.  Even if you do not care for the story or the acting, this is a film to watch for visuals.Thus, I believe that this film deserves far more credit than it received.  I, personally, loved it for varied reasons, but I have to admit that what truly captured me was the way Bernard Rose can take an average script and transform it into a beautiful film using visuals and music.  Very few directors take the time to put music and image together if they use classical scores (my favourites would be David Lean and John Boorman), and I believe Bernard Rose should be watched in the future.  I should love to see what he would do with a film set in late 19th century Italy, when opera was at its height!***1\/2 out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"2 September 2000","score":"19 out of 23 people found the following review useful","review":"  Now, perhaps I'm out of my element writing a review for Anna Karenina without having read the book, but I shall do so regardless.

That was until today when I watched Message in a Bottle.    Kudos to Luis Mandoki for directing such a beautiful film, and creating that unique feeling of grieving over a lost love, finding love again, and ultimately grieving over another love lost.  As with City of Angels, Message in a Bottle takes you on a journey through the trials and tribulations of loosing a loved one and trying to cope with the loss.Garrett Blake (Kevin Costner) has lost his wife to an ailment brought on by their first pregnancy.  Blake has spent the last 2 years of his life mourning the loss by `cocooning' himself and cutting the world off.  He has his father Dodge, played brilliantly by Paul Newman, and his love of restoring old boats, which he takes very seriously.  Theresa Osborne (Robin Wright) works for the Chicago Tribune in the research department.  While on a trip to the cape, to drop her son off with her ex-husband, she discovers a bottle on the beach.  The bottle contains a message addressed to a Catherine, and goes on to say how sorry the writer is for `not understanding' and `not helping in her time of need'.   The more she reads, the more she feels the love the writer has for this Catherine, and how much she really meant to him.  The letter, as precious as it is, is signed simply with &#145;G'. The editor of the paper where Theresa works decides to print the letter in the paper, and hundreds of letters are sent in return.  One particular letter contains a copy of a letter found by another woman in a town a few states south of that cape where the original letter found by Theresa surfaced.  With this second letter, Theresa begins to piece together the puzzle, and when a third letter, this one not addressed to Catherine or signed by &#145;G' but on the same stationary is found, she convinces her editor to send her off and find this &#145;G'.   Theresa gets the name of the author of the letters, and goes to his small town to meet him.  When she does, she begins to fall in love with him, just like she fell in love with the letters.  After learning much of each other, Garrett (G) begins to have strong feelings for Theresa, but his undying love for his deceased wife Catherine keeps him from expressing those feelings.As time wears on, Theresa heads back home to Chicago, and doesn't hear from Garrett for a few weeks.  Finally he calls her, and they set up a trip for Garrett to visit her in Chicago.  While there, he ultimately finds the bottle and letters in her nightstand drawer and storms out of her home.  Garrett heads back home, and Theresa starts to put her life back together.Weeks go by, and Theresa receives a letter from a Garrett telling her that he has finished building the boat that he and his wife started, and will be sailing it on a specific date and invites her to join in the festivities.  She does, and when she arrives she hears Garrett christen his boat, the &#145;Catherine', with loving words about his lost wife.  Theresa leaves, and later Garrett catches up with her where they discuss what future they have.  Together they ultimately decide that they have no future, and Theresa heads back to Chicago.At this time, Garrett and his father have a touching heart to heart talk, and Garrett finally realizes that he isn't willing to let Theresa walk out of his life.  He writes another letter, this one to tell Catherine that he loves Theresa `&#133;just as much as he loved her.'  In the final scenes of the movie, we see Garrett take his boat out to sea presumably to throw one final bottle into the water, and begin his life with Theresa.  While sailing, Garrett reaches another boat in distress with a family on it.  The treacherous sea has damaged their boat, and Garrett tries to save them.  He manages to pull the father and daughter aboard his boat, but the wife is still in the water.  He decides to jump in and swim to her, but when he gets to her he realizes that he has no chance, and in the end he and the woman drown.

That was until today when I watched Message in a Bottle.    Kudos to Luis Mandoki for directing such a beautiful film, and creating that unique feeling of grieving over a lost love, finding love again, and ultimately grieving over another love lost.  As with City of Angels, Message in a Bottle takes you on a journey through the trials and tribulations of loosing a loved one and trying to cope with the loss.Garrett Blake (Kevin Costner) has lost his wife to an ailment brought on by their first pregnancy.  Blake has spent the last 2 years of his life mourning the loss by `cocooning' himself and cutting the world off.  He has his father Dodge, played brilliantly by Paul Newman, and his love of restoring old boats, which he takes very seriously.  Theresa Osborne (Robin Wright) works for the Chicago Tribune in the research department.  While on a trip to the cape, to drop her son off with her ex-husband, she discovers a bottle on the beach.  The bottle contains a message addressed to a Catherine, and goes on to say how sorry the writer is for `not understanding' and `not helping in her time of need'.   The more she reads, the more she feels the love the writer has for this Catherine, and how much she really meant to him.  The letter, as precious as it is, is signed simply with &#145;G'. The editor of the paper where Theresa works decides to print the letter in the paper, and hundreds of letters are sent in return.  One particular letter contains a copy of a letter found by another woman in a town a few states south of that cape where the original letter found by Theresa surfaced.  With this second letter, Theresa begins to piece together the puzzle, and when a third letter, this one not addressed to Catherine or signed by &#145;G' but on the same stationary is found, she convinces her editor to send her off and find this &#145;G'.   Theresa gets the name of the author of the letters, and goes to his small town to meet him.  When she does, she begins to fall in love with him, just like she fell in love with the letters.  After learning much of each other, Garrett (G) begins to have strong feelings for Theresa, but his undying love for his deceased wife Catherine keeps him from expressing those feelings.As time wears on, Theresa heads back home to Chicago, and doesn't hear from Garrett for a few weeks.  Finally he calls her, and they set up a trip for Garrett to visit her in Chicago.  While there, he ultimately finds the bottle and letters in her nightstand drawer and storms out of her home.  Garrett heads back home, and Theresa starts to put her life back together.Weeks go by, and Theresa receives a letter from a Garrett telling her that he has finished building the boat that he and his wife started, and will be sailing it on a specific date and invites her to join in the festivities.  She does, and when she arrives she hears Garrett christen his boat, the &#145;Catherine', with loving words about his lost wife.  Theresa leaves, and later Garrett catches up with her where they discuss what future they have.  Together they ultimately decide that they have no future, and Theresa heads back to Chicago.At this time, Garrett and his father have a touching heart to heart talk, and Garrett finally realizes that he isn't willing to let Theresa walk out of his life.  He writes another letter, this one to tell Catherine that he loves Theresa `&#133;just as much as he loved her.'  In the final scenes of the movie, we see Garrett take his boat out to sea presumably to throw one final bottle into the water, and begin his life with Theresa.  While sailing, Garrett reaches another boat in distress with a family on it.  The treacherous sea has damaged their boat, and Garrett tries to save them.  He manages to pull the father and daughter aboard his boat, but the wife is still in the water.  He decides to jump in and swim to her, but when he gets to her he realizes that he has no chance, and in the end he and the woman drown.

However, the film left much to be desired.  It seemed like the director must have shot a 2-1\/2 hour film before they edited down to 88 minutes.  The plot was disjointed at best, and there was little palpable character development.  Anyone who did not follow the TV series into its final days would have been lost watching this film. The costuming, especially for the villains, was just too cheesy- I think they recycled some clothing & make-up from Mad Max.  The special effects had a high-dollar look, but seemed to have been executed by an amateur hand. And even the cinematography was poor.  Fast-motion techniques were used to make some of the fight scenes look more exciting, but it made them laughable, ala Three Stooges.  Lighting & editing even suffered.  And if you ever saw The Karate Kid, wait until you see Connor MacLeod's version of the Crane Technique- just like Karate Kid, it fails, and Duncan has to overcome the failure in order to win the final battle.  This film is high octane cheese with low-budget script writing.  At the end, several people voiced (rather loudly) their disgust as the credits began to roll.

And here is the problem - there is no narrative in the book, it is a collection of incidents linked by three major themes (poverty, class & like Angel At My Table the heroes' rotting teeth). Parker even throws away the minor theme (which grows through the memoir) of a desire to return to America.    The result is a mess of pottage. It is as if Parker hasn't even bothered to read the book (and, incidently gives more screentime to Malachy's alcoholism than Frank does). It's as if the old Victorian melodrama fable of the poverty stricken family linked to the drunken father is irresistable to Parker - irresistable but he's unable to actually DO anything with the dramatic cliche.    The film is ill-served by some very peculiar camera-work. For instance  the early parts of the film are all shot down at the level of young Frank but the POV is looking down on the action (i.e. camera low, set far away, and framed at a downward angle). For all sorts of reasons this is wrong not the least being that it distances the audience from the characters by making us appear to sit in judgement upon them.

I am particularly a fan of the TV series and of the character of Duncan Macleod, so you can imagine my anticipation for this film. I was NOT disappointed! I loved this film. It had everything and more. I watched the trailer when it was released, about 20 times, trying to absorb every image and emotion of what they were showing us. Let me tell you, two very distinct sequences from the trailer are NOT in the film. One being the scene where Connor (Christopher Lambert) cuts Kell in half and he reforms in two pieces (two Kell's standing in front of Connor). This scene was cut from the final version of the film. Thank God, that appeared tacky. The other notable change was the voice over by Methos (Peter Wingfield)That goes like He's the oldest living immortal. This line is nowhere to be found in the film...Again, THANK GOD!!! I thought that would take away from Methos being the oldest living immortal and it would be too easy to say that the bad guy is just really old and powerful! Been done!!! They decided to obliterate all of those scenes and references from the final cut of the film! Ultimately, this is going to make the fans of the old films and the series very happy! The fight sequences are simply spectacular! Some of the absolute best fights in all of the Highlander film and episodes!!!! Go see it! You will not be disappointed! Hopefully it will make new fans as well! I give it a 9.5 \/10!!!! I just HOPE they continue the franchise! It is worth it to keep it going!! So rush out...Run, don't walk and see HIGHLANDER ENDGAME!!!!!!! ","genre":null},{"date":"2 September 2000","score":"","review":"  I am a very big fan of the HIGHLANDER franchise.

Let's start with advertising.  Many of the scenes in the trailers never were in the movie (glad they scrapped the supernatural powers junk, though). Here are other problems-1. I don't believe Duncan would be so ho-hum when watching Kell about to take Connor's head (although it turns out he doesn't kill him).2. Duncan was never married in the series, and what's up with he and Kate\/Faith getting back together despite her alliance with Kell? It's a bit too much of a stretch. And Duncan makes Faith immortal by killing her. This is definitely not Duncan's style.4. What's up with the Watchers not wanting the Prize to be won, and what exactly is the Prize now supposed to be? What's so threatening to them about it being won (even by a good immortal)?5. Quickenings on holy ground. This is against the rules, and no villain ever broke this one before. Looks like plenty were bad enough to have done it, so why now? Theoretically it can be done, but never before has been. What happens if you break this rule? And if the consequences are so dire, why are there none for Kell?6. Originally Connor did not find Duncan immediately after Duncan was killed. Majorly conflicts with several series storylines.7. Would Duncan have really killed Connor, or would he have let Connor win? Seems like Duncan would never kill Connor like this. Then again, if he looked at the grand scheme of things, this new version of Connor would not have beaten Kell, and so he had others to protect by doing what he did. I don't know. It was too clean, too easy... Adrian Paul did once say that this would never happen in the movie, but it did anyway.Hey, this movie is alright if you don't really care about accuracy and are not a hardcore fan and don't expect things to make much sense here. It's still enjoyable enough, but it's a hodgepodge lukewarm effort that leaves lots of things unanswered. It has it's good points, but it's very lacking overall. I liked it enough, but it leaves a bit of a bad taste in my mouth, too. A disappointment I didn't expect since this was supposed to follow in the tradition of the series, which was a very good series indeed. Could have been really special, but is a half-hearted effort and squanders Paul's abilities. Apparently high on continuity errors, too, though I don't recall any in particular myself.This franchise keeps reinventing itself. My advice- get back to basics and make a fifth and final movie that disregards just about everything but the series (too much to scrap\/keep to go into here), and make it like the series eps. Most any series ep would have made a better movie than this.
