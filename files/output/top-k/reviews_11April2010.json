Ray left the Agency after a mission to blow up a South American drug dealer went wrong, resulting in the death of an innocent young girl. Ray is now working as a freelance hit man, and is hired by a young woman named May Munro. (M. Munro? Is this evidence of Sharon Stone's Marilyn complex?) May wants revenge on Joe Leon, a Miami gangster and drug baron, who was responsible for the murders of her parents. Ray has a personal interest in the case as his former CIA colleague Ned Trent is now working for Leon, the two men have become estranged, as it was Ned's ruthlessness that was responsible for the girl's death.You can work out the rest of the story yourselves. Actually, there isn't much story to work out. Just one big bang after another.The film was directed by Luis Llosa, the man who a few years later was to be responsible for the awesomely bad Anaconda, one of the nineties' greatest examples of the Ed Wood school of film-making. In 1994, however, Senor Llosa was a mere freshman in this particular school and had not yet mastered the art of making a truly awful movie. His chances might have been improved had he been able to secure Steven Seagal as his male lead. The producers apparently offered Seagal the role, but turned him down when he demanded $9 million to star and direct. (If I were a film producer I would happily pay $9 million just to keep Seagal out of one of my movies, but that's another story). Deprived of the services of Hollywood's most wooden leading man, Llosa was forced to turn to Sly, who is just not in the same league when it comes to the noble skills of Bad Acting. He has even been known occasionally to resort to Good Acting (although, admittedly, not in this film).Llosa did, admittedly, direct Sharon Stone to a Worst Actress Razzie, but he can claim little credit for this, as the Razzies frequently have less to do with recognising truly bad films than they do with settling old scores and cutting tall poppies down to size. After the success of Basic Instinct, few poppies in the early nineties can have been taller than Stone, and the Razzie was probably a way of warning her not to get too big for her boots. Certainly, her performance here does not involve much Good Acting, but it is a perfectly adequate one when one considers that she is not being called upon to portray Lady Macbeth or Hedda Gabler but the glamorous heroine of an action-thriller.There is, in fact, little Good Acting anywhere on display here; the nearest approach is probably James Woods' splendidly over-the-top contribution as the villainous Ned. As in Anaconda Llosa manages to achieve the feat of damaging the reputation of a once-distinguished but now ageing actor. In Anaconda he was to perform this service for Jon Voight; here it is Rod Steiger as Leon who is left with that look of why on earth did I ever sign up for this? The Specialist can therefore be regarded as a valiant attempt to make a Bad Movie, but the sublime heights of So Bad It's Funny were, as yet, beyond its director's grasp. All he ended up with was a rather dull, derivative and uninteresting action-thriller. My main objection to it was the glorification of the character of Ray Quick who, despite an attempt to give him some sort of ethical code, is no more than a hired killer. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 April 2010","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The Specialist can perhaps best be described as Sylvester Stallone doing what he does best- Rambo-style mayhem- meets Sharon Stone doing what she does best- looking sexy and glamorous.Sly plays Ray Quick, the specialist of the title, who is a former CIA explosives expert.

I also had to read the biography of Audrey by Hepburn's son, Sean Ferrer, which was beautiful and recommended. They (novella and movie) complement each other even though they have very different endings.The Novella is based during the wartime years - 1943-1944 in Manhattan while the movie was made contemporary at the time of its making, 1960.While Truman Capote was very disappointed with the direction the screenwriter took, both movie and novella stand on their own as excellent works.And THE PARTY - man - if you don't wish you were there you are more dead than alive. Half of it was perfectly choreographed while the other half was impromptu. It took 8 days to film. All I have to say is when in Manhattan I would love to seek out Holly Golightly's apt and wrangle an invitation. Will Holly Golightly and Paul Fred Varjak get together? I would call the movie a romantic comedy while the original novella more a social commentary. And as I mentioned both are excellent in their own right.Audrey Hepburn, who feared whether she was up to this role, played the part of Holly to the hilt. And time has shown this to be her signature movie. The opening scene, shot on Fifth Avenue, was a work of cinematographic art, shot by the Hollywood legend Franz Planer. One observation I will note since really studying not only the history of this movie and Truman's original novella Henry Mancini wrote Moon River for this movie - and particularly Audrey Hepburn. At the film's initial screening in San Francisco, after the showing all the principals converged to director Blake Edward's suite. As the story goes (told by producer Richard Shepard) the then-head of Paramount wanted to scrap Moon River. Over my dead body, both Hepburn and Shepard reputedly said. There is a controversy to this day over whether the song should have remained, with the lyrics being a bit weak (in the opinion of some in the industry) but I maintain that it is the melody that is so powerful. Hepburn's son Sean Ferrer in his wonderful biography of his mother, maintained that Audrey felt the same about melodies. Good to know Audrey and I are in agreement ;-) In any event Mancini maintained that of the thousands of versions of Moon River in the intervening 50 years, Hepburn's singing of it (uncredited) with her guitar was the purest and most representative of what Mancini wanted. And Moon River took an Oscar that year, and is still played 50 years later. So as far as I am concerned that should end the controversy. The only downside to this movie - and both directors Blake Edwards and Producer Richard Shepard have admitted so 50 years later - was the caricature of a Japanese by Mickey Rooney. It isn't Rooney's fault as he was doing what the director and screenwriter wanted 50 years ago but today the performance is more of stereotypes and not realistic. The novella really didn't do this - only mentioning that the landlord was Japanese - only the movie.But overall it is a small flaw in an otherwise classic movie that will still be appreciated another 50 years from now.

With the sequels the deaths though still gruesome aren't very scary and you more tended to laugh, but with the first one there are some genuinely scary moments that did throw me off balance like when the bus kills Terry Chaney (played by Amanda Detmer), that just scared the crap out of me. Also the start with the plane crashing in Alex's premonition had me on edge and arguably the scariest scene of the movie was when Alex and Clear go to see Todd's dead body and they run into the mortician played excellently by Tony Todd. Throughout there is plenty of suspense and tension helped by great music in whether the characters will survive. Also what is rare with your average horror flicks is any emotional connection to the characters. I cared about Alex and Clear and as they become a couple I hoped they would survive and Carter I hated him! Though the script and dialogue was a bit rubbish, it's easily forgiven. The acting is to a good standard particularly Devon Sawa as Alex and Ali Larter as Clear Rivers. The story is also original and different, which makes it refreshing and the ending is great. In referring to the ending I also loved the soundtrack when the credits rolled up. It was great. The special effects though obviously they would look bad now was good for it's time.That's why I think FD is a brilliant movie and deserves such a high rating and even though with each sequel they have been getting worse.

Also the start with the plane crashing in Alex's premonition had me on edge and arguably the scariest scene of the movie was when Alex and Clear go to see Todd's dead body and they run into the mortician played excellently by Tony Todd. Throughout there is plenty of suspense and tension helped by great music in whether the characters will survive. Also what is rare with your average horror flicks is any emotional connection to the characters. I cared about Alex and Clear and as they become a couple I hoped they would survive and Carter I hated him! Though the script and dialogue was a bit rubbish, it's easily forgiven. The acting is to a good standard particularly Devon Sawa as Alex and Ali Larter as Clear Rivers. The story is also original and different, which makes it refreshing and the ending is great. In referring to the ending I also loved the soundtrack when the credits rolled up. It was great. The special effects though obviously they would look bad now was good for it's time.That's why I think FD is a brilliant movie and deserves such a high rating and even though with each sequel they have been getting worse. FD will never lose it's touch and will remain for me the best of the franchise.

But compared with millions loving this and winner of 11 academy awards, those voices of discontent against this film are left in the shade. Arguably for me James Cameron's greatest film. Titanic is a true epic of colossal scale. The acting is brilliant particularly with Leonardo Decaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose. They light up the screen as the two lovers separated by social class but not love. There romance is so beautifully depicted that you can't help but smile. The romantic story set aside the sinking is flawlessly intertwined.Though the film is in two parts the romance and the sinking the first hour and a half gives you the chance to come to know these two characters and others like nasty Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) and LoveJoy (David Warner) who play there parts excellently well with great support from Kathy Bates who plays the lively Molly Brown. There are some beautiful and forever memorable scenes between Jack and Rose when Jack first sees her, the third class party, when they kiss on the bow of the ship, Jack painting her naked, when they make love in the car and when they are both in the water after the ship has sunk and Jack dies. All these scenes and others are amazing. The music score by James Horner is hauntingly beautiful and sombre and made me cry when you see the full sinking in all it's horror.And you do James Cameron depicts everything showing not just the sinking from Jack and Roses perspective but different people in different parts of the ship as they scream desperately for help. So you end up caring not just for the main characters but all the small cameo roles played by hundreds of people. Morality questions are raised about how things were handled by white star liner. These are haunting images that burn in your mind and stay with you long after. The most haunting scene is when loads of passengers are in the water and when most of them had died. The cameras focusing on one of the lifeboats coming back is the ethereal feel of a mythic force. Cameron creates suspense and tension at whether the two lovers will survive and you just deeply care about them. The costumes and ship itself look simply magnificent and are a wonder to look at. The end scene as well where the old Rose dies in her sleep and has the happy memory of marrying Jack on Titanic and when he dies in the water made me cry my eyes out and is one of the best scenes I have ever seen in film. Titanic is a epic film and James Cameron has shown this disaster in all it's horror and is a tribute to the victims of this tragedy. In 2012 there has been a rumour that he is going to re-release the film in 3D. It will be even more incredible no doubt (he proved that with Avatar) but it's the storytelling,which will recapture the myth of this fascinating tale that has been told throughout world generations. Even now as one reviewer Baybee from Austrailia quotes about Titanic the film.This would have to be one of the most wonderful films of the 20th century and one that will never be forgottenI couldn't have put it better myself. Even after watching this time after time the film still has that powerful impact of making me feel sad. Truly remarkable.

","genre":"Animation, Family, Fantasy"},{"date":"11 April 2010","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Reds follows the lives of American journalist John 'Jack' Reed and his wife, Louise Bryant, amidst the background of the Bolshevik Revolution. It's an interesting, enjoyable epic with several good performances by Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Paul Sorvino, Jerzy Kosinski, and other good actors in cameo roles. The movie has been sold as a romantic epic, and indeed shows a good deal of the difficult, complex relationship between Jack and Louise.But I think director Warren Beatty just used this as bait for the real interesting story of Reds, which is the way Jack becomes more and more involved in the Revolution to the point that he becomes one of the Party's members and an influential speaker.The movie starts shortly before Louise meets Jack, in an interview, and immediately they feel an attraction for each other that leads her to abandon her husband and come live with Jack in New York. The first hour of the movie emphasizes their relationship mostly, especially the love affair between Louise and playwright Eugene O'Neill, and the effect Jack's work, which kept him away from her for long periods, had on their love.It is when Jack invites Louise to travel with him to Russia to cover the Revolution, that the movie becomes fascinating and marks a turning point in his life as he stops being a man reporting news to being a man involved in History, in the creation of news.Although it's clear that Beatty has love for the character he's playing, he nevertheless paints a disillusioned portrait of the Revolution and shows how quickly and easily it started going wrong. The hunger, the lack of fuel, the rise of oppression, are captured in this movie. And as a testament to his courage, he never allows Jack to have doubts or regrets. When the character Emma Goldman observes how the revolution has betrayed its own values, he makes a passionate speech about ends justifying means. Seldom do we witness such inflexibility and callousness in lead characters, not to mention one played by a star like Warren Beatty. But even though Jack remains faithful to the revolution, Beatty doesn't shy away from showing how he was used by it and gives the impression that Jack was involved in something that was too big for him.In the acting department, this movie is flawless. Maureen Stapleton didn't impress me enough in her role of Emma Goldman, but Nicholson, Keaton and Beatty were all wonderful. Nicholson was very little in the movie, but the few minutes he was in were hypnotic. And Keaton showed just how easily she can transmit feelings with just her eyes and body language.I'd also like to commend the work of director of photography Vittorio Storaro. I've been a fan of him for a while now. The images he captured in movies like The Conformist or The Spider's Stratagem have never left my mind due to their beauty. And his work in Reds was quite good too. In the first forty minutes his camera seemed sedate, but then he slowly starts showing that style that has made him one of the best DPs in the world the way he captures colors, the composition of his shots, the symmetry in them. When the action changes to Russia, it becomes especially memorable.The movie is not always engaging, sometimes it's dull. The pacing is uneven, and hardly helped by the intrusive moments with witnesses talking about the events in the movie. Sadly they're not identified and their relationship with the characters is never explained. It's an interesting, risky choice that I think didn't succeed. Otherwise, Reds is good movie to watch, a marvel of film-making that is also an interesting recreation of a historical episode that reshaped our world.
