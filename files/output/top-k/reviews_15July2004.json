But did I want to see her running for 60-65 minutes out of an 80-minute movie?  No way.  I also agree that Tykwer put in a lot of cool camera tricks and technical wizardry, but gimmicks don't make a good movie.  Take away the running and the gimmicks and all that's left is a short subject.  To make matters worse, the bare-bones plot line (Lola runs to save her boyfriend) is repeated in three similar scenarios with different choices along the way resulting in different final outcomes.  This movie has a lot of style with little substance and sparse dialog.  I find the butterfly effect (a small change at one point in time has a large effect later on) to be as fascinating as some of the other reviewers here, but a much better movie on the subject is the under-rated 2003 movie, The Butterfly Effect. Some other thoughts  Twice Lola screams so loudly that she breaks glass in the room around her.  Her ability to break glass by screaming has nothing to do with the plot and seems to have been put in just to make the movie a little more peculiar.  Lola apparently has other unusual abilities as well, like telekinesis.  She seems to be able to cause the ball in a roulette game to land on a certain number.  And depending on how you interpret the plot, Lola may even be able to go back in time to prevent her own death.  However, the movie never explains how Lola is able to do any of these things.I give Run, Lola, Run 4 out of 10.

He escapes, but after a short while he's caught once again. This time ends up in a freakish reality show in which he's supposed to run for a while from a bunch of tough guys with different themes, and eventually die. But we all know Arnie, and we all know that he's tougher than even the toughest of tough guys.I really wanted to like this movie, being an Arnie-fan and all. However, The Running Man contains too many flaws that really annoy the crap out of me. E.g. The reconstruction of Arnie's fight inside the helicopter, where the shocked audience is showed a short summary of the incident, complete with 5-10 different camera angles. This means that the military helicopter in which Arnie flew was equipped with almost 10 cameras filming the crew members, one of which _inside_ the eye of one of the crew members Arnie beats.There are other flaws also, and the plot, which in theory seems to be very interesting and innovative, works for a while, then it sort of creates a pool of stupidness and unrealism in which it drowns.The acting can't really be said to be anything better than sub par, with Arnie in the leading role, doing an average Arnie performance. The rest of the cast get by without being especially good or bad.The special effects are OK, without being impressive.RATING 3\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"15 July 2004","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  SPOILER ALERTSoooo, Arnie's really a good guy, but after an incident with some fighting in a helicopter and some disobeying of orders, he's sent to jail (or rather some sort of work camp).

This one is sooooo awful it's amazing. Just everything about it is so lame. The effects are terrible - they might have been better in 3D, but on a TV screen the plasticky-ness of it is all too apparent. The acting is well below par for the big names on show here, with some horrible dialogue thrown in just to make things worse.In fact, only the basic premise of the movie has any promise - a killer shark attacking an underwater theme\/amusement park. But the idea, though good, is drowned (pun intended) by the terrible crapness of the other elements of the film.That said, the movie entertained me, but not in any traditional horror sense. Rather I found myself laughing so much at the lame effects, bad dialogue and the terrible liberties taken with physics and shark facts that the movie was a fantastic journey of delightful nonsense. Not so much the Hunting of the Snark, but the Hunting of the Shark! If you see what I mean.There is, in fact so much non-stop nonsense that it gets a bit overwhelming at times. The shark is about as lifelike as a rubber shark can get, but towards the end there are some especially dire effects of the shark with its head stuck in the control room window. The stop-motion animation of the tail is extremely bad - you'll see better on most kids animated puppet shows - and the tail doesn't so much sweep back and forth as just twitch inanely. Of course, how it got stuck in the window is almost as hilarious. In 3D it might have looked OK, but on a TV screen (no matter how big) the shark just seemed to drift up to window with all the menace (and realism) of a bath toy shark. This scene 's hilarity was compounded by the looks of absolute horror on the faces of the control room occupants. Priceless! No matter how much you want to turn off, it's worth waiting to see this scene alone.Of course, the general physics is just as abused as the shark info. A grenade goes off underwater, not twenty feet from a couple of divers and they're not even stunned a tiny amount - no burst eardrums at all. Bah! Who cares if water is virtually incompressible! It won't transmit the shock wave at all! No sir!If you fancy a terrifying journey into horror beneath the waves you'd be better off watching The Adventures of Captain Nemo (well, Burgess Meredith as Prof. Cunningham scared me, anyhow). But, if you fancy an awful, awful movie to laugh at with your mates and a crate of beer, this one is top notch stuff.
