One is his understanding of   pacing events, and the other is using his actors\/actresses to actually   act.    When you see Claudia Cardinale riding up to the ranch, all you see is   her face, but you can tell instantly what she is looking at and   everything she's feeling. You know Henry Fonda's the bad guy, but when   he smiles faintly at the young boy, you feel there's something more to   him, a personality and human qualities, even if he is evil.    The final shoot-out itself is a masterpiece. The two protagonists say   nothing, but as they face off the music lets you know the moment as   come. As they stand ready the scene that's been hinted at throughout   the movie plays out like a dream, revealing what the whole story was   about. Then, without warning, they draw and fire. Just as in real life,   it's over before you notice it.    What today's movies lack is how quickly they cater to MTV video   inspired nonstop action and endless clich�s. The bad and good guy duke   it it out, the violence is so extreme that no human could actually   survive it, and always just when you think the bad guy is dead he gets   back up for one last shot. How much I wish today's film makers would   learn Leone's lesson about TIMING, and let suspense build rather than   force it in.    The music score, which had certain pieces and sections for various   moods and to signify the main characters, is one of my favorites.

It was based on a true story and Joanne W-K's performance became the highlight of her career.  In The Man Who Knew Too Little, Joanne W-K once again plays this character but for laughs.  Kind of neat considering that the two films probably don't share the same audience (which is apparent since so far I am the only reviewer to pick up on this connection, despite the obvious spoof.) When she appeared on screen and I saw she was spoofing her Scandal role it was like actually getting one of Dennis Miller's intellectual jokes. If you have only seen one of the films you should see the other one too.  If you have not seen either start with Scandal, if not for chronological sake then at least to get the inside joke in the later (plus Scandal is a really good film and very timely considering the Clinton-Monica thing).  Bill fans (Murray that is) don't worry, he is here in fine form.  For movie buffs this film is but a series of spoofs of well-known, and not so well-known mostly film-noir flicks (think watered down Mel Brooks, circa Young Frankenstein, not so broad, not so obvious, but cool when you get it.)  If you're under the age of 35 you probably won't get them (my niece, part of the money demographic was shocked to find out that there was actually a movie called The Man Who Knew Too Much, which explains exactly why the film didn't do better box office.)  Most of all, the interest is Joanne Whalley-Kilmer who has brought back to comedic film the wonderful French Maid costume.  Once a staple of Vauldeville, Bob Hope comedies, and Pink Panther films, the French Maid's costume should be mandatory for all women endowed with great legs.  Oooh La La!  Even if you have not seen Hitchcock or British cinema, you never heard of film-noir (let alone pronounce it), and your knowledge of Cold War and foreign spy history is non-existent, there is Joanne W-K's killer bod and cool spoof.  And oh yes, Bill Murray's good too.

My other major problem is that at one point in the film, Neil Patrick Harris (TVs Doogie Howser) was standing right next to a bug and the bug didn't eat him.
