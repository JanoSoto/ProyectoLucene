It's a warm and touching, funny movie at times with Sally Field and James Garner portraying their characters with just the right amount of credibility. Not to sugarcoat this too much, I'm a guy, but I think the film hit the right notes for the kind of picture it was. There were only a couple scenes that I thought were forced, one was Murphy (Garner) and Bobby Jack (Brian Kerwin) deciding to dance together when they probably should have been coming to blows over each other's jealousy. The other was Emma's (Field) sneezing fit in the barn when Bobby tried to push his luck. It appeared that Miss Field never took sneeze lessons in acting school because it looked to me like she was about to crack up. If it was her way of putting off her ex, then I'll give her a pass. By the way, wasn't Bobby Jack just a perfect creep? Even the kid knew he cheated at cards.Now once I offer you this tip, I'm sure you'll take me up on the challenge. Just keep attentive during any modern flick and you're bound to see a product placement scene featuring Coca Cola. Usually it's a quick shot, but boy, the Coke folks got their money's worth here. There were at least six different Coke instances, more if you count a second glance within the same situation. This started out as a game between my wife and I after I first noticed how often the popular brand wound up in a movie, so it's second nature now. Just can't help myself.You know, Garner had a line that made me do some research. When he's invited to the movies, he mentions that he hadn't been to one since the Duke died. So I checked, and sure enough, John Wayne passed away six years prior to this film's release. Something else though, did you know Wayne's father was a pharmacist? Can you imagine that.

It stands up to its fame as truly one of the most depressing movies ever made, let alone a musical..!The movie revolves around a woman by the name Selma who works in a tool factory and does everything she could to stop her only son from going blind gradually, an inherent disease. How hard she tries to cope up with life and how she soothes her heart by imagining music in the most common of sounds is just amazing. Actress Bjork has given a performance that was made just for her. No one else in this world could do the role as fabulously as she had. Her innocent smile, an almost child-like voice and a highly believable performance make her character go down as one of the most beautiful characters ever portrayed in film history. All the other characters in the film portrayed their role very well too.The music numbers are just awesome. Specially the song 'I've seen it all' was simply wonderful. The usage of hand-held camera by Lars Trier was indeed very efficient and deserves a praise. His direction remains the hero of the film and was very powerful. he has taken a very simple story and had developed the characters as if he had all the time in the world. Once you get to relate to the character of Selma, you start seeing things in her perspective and the incidents happening get more and more painful to watch.Its very tough to see something so beautiful, so innocent and so fragile as the nature around us slowly getting destroyed. That is the main reason why this movie is so depressing. By depressing, I mean very Depressing. A lot of my friends watched this movie and everyone of them cried. That appeared very silly to me until I watched the movie myself. I tried incredibly hard to refrain from crying but it got harder and harder by the minute. Eventually, I cried so hard and the movie was so emotionally draining that I am trying not to cry even right now, as I am typing this review. And I don't feel the least bit silly about it.If this movie does not hit you in the heart, believe me when I say this, something is very very wrong with you. Once the movie is over and your head is still reeling with the emotion you had to deal with all the movie, suddenly you see the credits roll up with the innocent face of Selma smiling and sadness comes down on you like an avalanche, you start crying all over again. Putting this movie in words is an almost impossible task. Its best only if you see for yourself.An obvious 10 for 10. A spectacular achievement in every way.

I suppose the same line is valid in this review too. I'm not necessarily proud that I enjoyed both film adaptations, but there are times when we can not help what we liked. Again, from the first frame, I enjoyed the Brady's overwhelming eccentricities.The storyline is pure simplicity; the Brady's are stuck in the seventies while the whole world has kindly shifted into the nineties, therefore, capturing the idea that the Brady's, while timeless, are also pretty outdated. Mike Brady (reprised by Gary Cole) is contemplating what to give his darling gold-haired wife, Carol (Shelley Long) for their anniversary, but in the nick of time, a man claiming to be Carol's first husband named Roy (Tim Matheson) shows up and tries to win Carol back. In reality, he's a snaky con-man, searching for a statue of a marble horse.While the family naively welcomes Roy back home, Greg is hasty about the whole thing, yet never questions if something is really behind this alleged miracle. It is never truly said, however, how Roy managed to know all there was to know about the family, but nevermind that small little detail. The subplots follow other Brady characters, as expected, such as Jan trying to boast to the family about her new boyfriend, George Glass (who is imaginary), Marcia and Peter possibly falling in love, and the family traveling to Hawaii in the latter half of the picture.Again, much like the original film, the whole idea and premise is a little anarchic, but not to the point of utter senselessness.

I watched it last night and was instantly struck by the first 20 minutes which I thought was pretty painful if I am going to tell the truth, it just had no plot and everything just seemed to jump from place to place.

Now I do not think that that little or big thing wrong with the film was Scorsese. Scorsese is one of the finest directors around today, he has made brilliant films from Taxi Driver to Raging Bull to Mean Streets to Goodfellas, and his camera work here was wonderful, this film was beautifully shot and felt so atmospheric, especially scenes in the desert which did, admittedly captivate me. Dafoe as Jesus was Oscar worthy and certainly played his part with sheer conviction and brilliance, it was a powerhouse and mammoth performance back then and still holds up now. But his supporting cast were no where near the brilliance of Dafoe. Harvey Keitel who can, at times, be one of the best actors around, gives a performance that earned it's razzi nomination. There was no conviction in the acting and it all felt just, wrong. His accent played horribly with the whole scene and I did not think he was a good casting choice at all. The rest of the cast was palpable, with some minor but poorly acted roles from Barbara Hershey and David Bowie, who has no business in the film industry. The Last Temptation of Christ is a one man show as far as acting goes and Dafoe manages to take acting very far. This film had an element of schoolchild-ness to it, it felt like the kind of thing you would watch in an RS lesson on a lazy summer afternoon when the term is drawing to a close. It just felt very long and overplayed, there was very very little entertainment factor to this film and I have doubts that I will ever want to watch it again.

The rest of the cast was palpable, with some minor but poorly acted roles from Barbara Hershey and David Bowie, who has no business in the film industry. The Last Temptation of Christ is a one man show as far as acting goes and Dafoe manages to take acting very far. This film had an element of schoolchild-ness to it, it felt like the kind of thing you would watch in an RS lesson on a lazy summer afternoon when the term is drawing to a close. It just felt very long and overplayed, there was very very little entertainment factor to this film and I have doubts that I will ever want to watch it again. I would recommend this is watched by Scorsese fans like me or if you like long biblical films. 2 1\/2 Stars. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"15 September 2012","score":"","review":" Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors of all time. You can say he's Hollywood's goth director because he's known for his dark, macabre and surreal style. This is one of his best known films, possibly his signature film next to Edward scissor-hands and The nightmare before Christmas. Even though this is one of the most unique, creative and imaginative films ever, it does have one major flaw, much of the story simply dosen't make sense. Let me start by saying this film is a unique take on ghost comedies. Even though the movie's titled Beetlejuice, the main characters are really the Maitlands, played by great actors Alec Baldwin as Adam and Gena Davis as Barbra, who are an old fashioned couple who drowns in the start of the film. Davis and Baldwin are great in their roles in playing an un-hip, boring and naive couple, which perfectly clashes with the more unconventional Deetz family and you understand their motives. Burton has a fascination with the dead and I love his unique take on the afterlife. Here the afterlife is run like a bureaucratic business, the Maitlands are given The handbook for the recently deceased which is a thick boring book about instructions for living in the afterlife. And later they go to the main office of the afterlife, where they have to take a number and wait to be called and then there'll meet their caseworker Juno. The Maitlands find out that their trapped in their own house as ghost, if they try to leave the house they go to a bizarre place call Saturn and meet a giant sand-worm. I love how Tim gave a memorable twist to your average ghost comedy with the ghost being the one haunted by the living. I love how Tim created the Deetz family who moved in the old Maitland's home. The step-mom is Delia played wonderfully by Catherine O'Hara who dominates the family. I love her Gothic art work and she looks kinda sexy here. I love Jeffery Jones as the I don't want to get involved dad. And there's Winona Ryder as the depressed, suicidal teenager Lydia, who dresses like everyday's a funeral. This is one of Ryder's best performances and Lydia is interesting as she's the only person who can see ghost and would rather be friends with the dead then the living. And last but not least there's Micheal Keaton as Beetlejuice. Tim's a good story teller but unconventional. The title character dosen't appear until well after 40 minutes into the movie. I think he has only a total of 17 minutes of screen time in this movie, which sounds bad for a title character but like in Batman(also stared Keaton as the title character),where the title character dosen't appear a lot, Tim makes it work well. In a way everything is a much needed build up to introducing Beetlejuice. Keaton gives his best & most manic comedic performance. Beetlejuice is one of the most unique and memorable characters of all time. He's a deranged, erratic acting, gross and perverted ghost. But the bad thing is that he's such an interesting character but Tim never really explains anything about him. Juno explains he use to be her assistant but then became a bio-exorcist, claiming he can get rid of the living. But that's all he explains about him. Why do you have to say his name three times before he can appear? Why is he trapped in the model Adam created? What kind of a name is Beetlejuice? Why does he spell his name Beetlegeise?, Why couldn't he tell Lydia his name?, What's his cause of death?, How old is he? Who was he before he died?, Why does he have to marry Lydia in order to be free? and Why is he more powerful then other ghost we see? Unfortunley none of these questions are answered. In fact a lot of the story dosen't make sense, like Juno telling the Maitlands that the living can't see the dead but later she tells them to scare the Deetz by creating scary faces and Lydia can see them. It's also unclear weather Beetlejuice is supposed to be a villain or some anti-hero. I personally look at him as a bad guy. But if you overlook the fact that a lot of the plot is incoherent this is a very enjoyable film. The film is visually great! Tim's surreal visual are some of the best of surrealism's I ever seen. The calypso songs works well into the movie. Danny Elfman's score is great, it sounds like a manic circus. I also like the cheesy looking special effects. One of the highlights are seeing the other dead people and their look mirroring their death, like the receptionist who slit her wrist, the sexy woman cut in half and Juno who's throat's slit. Tim is able to make humor out of a grim subject like death. He even makes Lydia's attempt at suicide humorous. Warner Bros. really missed an opportunity to do a sequel to this film, maybe they could've explain more about Beetlejuice. Never the less a ghost comedy classic.

Goodness, this film is a disappointment. The original was fun, somewhat exciting, had funny lines, and an intriguing premise. With part 2, we are left with a lazy, low-speed retread that amounts to little more than spotting cameos by high profile country singers and athletes. There are some huge stunts here, as you would expect, but in between them we are treated to nothing but boredom. Much of the plot deals with Reynolds, Reid, and Field trying to transport a pregnant elephant across the country in order to make several hundred thousand dollars. Along the way, we have to sit through Reynolds and Field having a long, slow make-up\/break-up session. Ughh!Dom Deluise is on hand as an annoying ethnic-sounding doctor who keeps trying to get them to pull over so the elephant can receive proper care and deliver her baby safely. Maybe that makes for interesting viewing if you are a kid (I loved this movie as a child), but now it seems so anti-climatic. The only person who seems to want to keep this story moving is Reynolds, who has to know this script is a loser and needs more action. The only bright spot is the return of Jackie Gleason as Sheriff Buford T. Justice. Once again he sets out to track Reynolds down as Field has left his son at the altar to join the Bandit in another wild escapade. As funny as Gleason is in his multiple roles, when you watch this movie on basic cable, you miss most of his lines. Since most of them include a sum bitch or PG rated slur, someone apparently went back and re-dubbed most of his dialog for the small screen.

I thought this made for an interesting change of pace and for the first hour I was having a pretty good time. I thought the first hour delivered some pretty good action scenes as well as some nice laughs. Some of the best moments happened early on with a rather amazing car stunt down a small road on a cliff. Now, I'm not sure how they filmed this but I was constantly holding my breathe for that poor stunt man on the roof of the car with a cliff right beside it!

For starters, the story itself just isn't interesting enough to really hold ones attention for such a long running time. I'm really not sure why so many of these Bond pictures have to run at an extended running time but this here goes on way too long. Another problem is that I just really didn't care for the villain and found him to be one of the weakest to date. Again, Dalton does a nice job in the role of Bond and I also liked Maryam d'Abo.

Its a pretty safe bet that whoever wrote this thing has some issues with the U.S. Army. John Travolta stars as Warrant Officer Paul Brenner whose job it is to internally investigate crimes happening within the U.S. Military. He and a rape investigator played by Madeline Stowe are trying to solve the murder and possible rape of a high-profile general's daughter. She is also an army officer, and apparently sexually involved with several officers in her father's command. Travolta and Stowe are given 36 hours to solve the murder of this attractive young woman found nude, strangled, and tied down with tent stakes in the middle of the army base. Virtually every male character we meet is dangled in front of us as a suspect. But which of them did it? And why? And what was the horrible secret the young woman carried with her all the way from her days as a West Point cadet??? Though very little of this film is plausible, the story and the fine actors will pull you in. Travolta was still in a pretty good groove when this was made. I don't think Battlefield Earth had yet been released. James Cromwell, with his role as the stuffy general concerned mostly with his reputation, pretty much solidified a place amongst the WASPy a-hole hall of fame. With this film, he joined the ranks of William Atherton, Dabney Coleman, Bob Gunton and a-holes of the past like Lane Smith, Paul Gleason, and J.T. Walsh. These actors could always be counted on to be strict wardens, cops, teachers, politicians and anything else synonymous with stuffy white males. Cromwell is a hoot. James Woods steals all of his scenes, as you might expect. Clarence Williams III is as intimidating as usual. That guy could be intimidating just going into McDonald's and ordering something off the dollar menu! Stowe's character seems tacked on; basically a living woman to put in danger. But she is always a welcome sight.It's no surprise that the army refused to have anything to do with this movie. Everyone on this base is portrayed as either a deviant sex-maniac, or a phony officer hiding behind a chest of ribbons and medals. The film wishes to be an advocate for women in the military who may in fact face sexual harassment on a regular basis. But the sleazy script and characters drown out any serious thought here. This movie is meant to press buttons rather than create awareness. There is a brutal rape scene at one point that would make Michael Winner smile. Anyone else will find it hard to sit through. The army base in this film is like the one in From Here to Eternity on crack. Not to give anything away, but it isn't really hard to figure out who committed the murder.

This coming from the same man who would probably encourage families with more than a single pet to grind up one of their cats for the villages of China. Well, Mr. Bastesen would have probably been&#x97;and just might have been, depending if he saw the movie or not&#x97;just as infuriated by the content of the last movie that Keiko had starred in. The movie is Free Willy 3 The Rescue, and it takes a politically correct hand holding a politically correct spear and jabs it into the guts of people like Mr. Bastesen. I support the cause all the way. I just wish I could support the movie for its dramatic content. Again, this is a review of the movie, not the movie's cause.Free Willy 3 The Rescue is a prime example of an underwritten kids' movie sequel something we unfortunately get too much of these days. It is the third and&#x97;until just recently&#x97;last installment in the popular franchise about a young boy (Jason James Richter) and his friendship with a six-ton whale (Keiko). In the previous two movies, Mr. Richter saved Keiko first from a neglectful theme park owner and then later from oil-infested waters. Now the threat comes from a band of poachers, the leader of whom is taking his son along on the hunt for the very first time. As one would expect, the son (Vincent Berry) doesn't conform to his father's illicit way of making a living and ends up siding with Mr. Richter to save Willy and his family.There are good elements to Free Willy 3. One of the promising dynamic between Mr. Berry and the superb actor Patrick Kilpatrick as his father. The latter does a particularly good job portraying a man who devotedly loves his family and blindly does what he does partially out of the desire to support his loved ones and partially because his family tree essentially demands it of him. His grandfather harpooned sperm whales so he feels he should harpoon orcas. I also appreciated how well Mr. Berry displayed enthusiasm at the beginning&#x97;going on a big event with his father&#x97;and then the horror when he first sees an innocent animal getting run clean through with a harpoon. The emotion in this sequence doubles the emotion&#x97;and lessens the gimmicky disturbance&#x97;from a similar scene in Michael Anderson's pretentious 1977 film Orca. I also enjoyed Mr. Richter's third-time-around performance. The only other returning character is August Schellenberg; he's reliable as well. Apart from that, I did enjoy some of the scenery when the characters on land; there's something magnetic about looking at a coastal village the docks, the boats, the water shoreline, the coastal trees. It's the sort of place one thinks about retiring to someday.However, the screenplay to Free Willy 3 follows its politically correct formula without a whole lot of style. Now the first Free Willy movie, released in 1993, did not say anything we didn't already know about the issue of whales in captivity, but it approached the subject with a great deal of heart. Hence why it won over the hearts of many children, myself included. But John Mattson's script for the third movie does not have very much of this, and there is zero sense of friendship between Jason James Richter and the whale. As far as the movie is concerned, these two just met for the first time and Mr. Richter is merely fascinated by the whale. And even the whale is not given much to do. The movie might as well be about a trivial whale, not one that starred in two previous pictures. The animatronic stand-ins for Keiko are utilized too often now, and the jaws open and close with too much hectic speed to convince that it's flesh and blood. A scene where the protagonist feed Willy and his mate oranges is very revealing. There's no sensation from past events, such as the time Willy saved Mr. Richter from drowning in the tank in the first film. And although Vincent Berry does have some cute scenes between him and the whale (at one point they start to play volleyball with the whale launching the ball back onto the decks of the boat), there are not enough of them.The movie overall is a lazy effort with a rushed mindset. It ironically comes alive mostly when it is on land and is not so exciting when on the water. And even the usually interesting concluding shots of the whales swimming and leaping freely through the frigid North Pacific waters is disappointing this time around, as they are merely reusing stock shots from the previous two pictures. It's really jarring when at one point the whales are moving behind a blue sky, then a red-laced dusk setting, and then a blue one again.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Family"},{"date":"15 September 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" In 1998, a man named Steinar Bastesen publicly declared his opinion that the money spent on training the captive orca Keiko should instead be spent on grinding the poor animal into six tons of meatballs as foreign aid for the starving people in Africa. This coming from the same man who would probably encourage families with more than a single pet to grind up one of their cats for the villages of China. Well, Mr. Bastesen would have probably been&#x97;and just might have been, depending if he saw the movie or not&#x97;just as infuriated by the content of the last movie that Keiko had starred in. The movie is Free Willy 3 The Rescue, and it takes a politically correct hand holding a politically correct spear and jabs it into the guts of people like Mr. Bastesen. I support the cause all the way. I just wish I could support the movie for its dramatic content. Again, this is a review of the movie, not the movie's cause.Free Willy 3 The Rescue is a prime example of an underwritten kids' movie sequel something we unfortunately get too much of these days. It is the third and&#x97;until just recently&#x97;last installment in the popular franchise about a young boy (Jason James Richter) and his friendship with a six-ton whale (Keiko). In the previous two movies, Mr. Richter saved Keiko first from a neglectful theme park owner and then later from oil-infested waters. Now the threat comes from a band of poachers, the leader of whom is taking his son along on the hunt for the very first time. As one would expect, the son (Vincent Berry) doesn't conform to his father's illicit way of making a living and ends up siding with Mr. Richter to save Willy and his family.There are good elements to Free Willy 3. One of the promising dynamic between Mr. Berry and the superb actor Patrick Kilpatrick as his father. The latter does a particularly good job portraying a man who devotedly loves his family and blindly does what he does partially out of the desire to support his loved ones and partially because his family tree essentially demands it of him. His grandfather harpooned sperm whales so he feels he should harpoon orcas. I also appreciated how well Mr. Berry displayed enthusiasm at the beginning&#x97;going on a big event with his father&#x97;and then the horror when he first sees an innocent animal getting run clean through with a harpoon. The emotion in this sequence doubles the emotion&#x97;and lessens the gimmicky disturbance&#x97;from a similar scene in Michael Anderson's pretentious 1977 film Orca. I also enjoyed Mr. Richter's third-time-around performance. The only other returning character is August Schellenberg; he's reliable as well. Apart from that, I did enjoy some of the scenery when the characters on land; there's something magnetic about looking at a coastal village the docks, the boats, the water shoreline, the coastal trees. It's the sort of place one thinks about retiring to someday.However, the screenplay to Free Willy 3 follows its politically correct formula without a whole lot of style. Now the first Free Willy movie, released in 1993, did not say anything we didn't already know about the issue of whales in captivity, but it approached the subject with a great deal of heart. Hence why it won over the hearts of many children, myself included. But John Mattson's script for the third movie does not have very much of this, and there is zero sense of friendship between Jason James Richter and the whale. As far as the movie is concerned, these two just met for the first time and Mr. Richter is merely fascinated by the whale. And even the whale is not given much to do. The movie might as well be about a trivial whale, not one that starred in two previous pictures. The animatronic stand-ins for Keiko are utilized too often now, and the jaws open and close with too much hectic speed to convince that it's flesh and blood. A scene where the protagonist feed Willy and his mate oranges is very revealing. There's no sensation from past events, such as the time Willy saved Mr. Richter from drowning in the tank in the first film. And although Vincent Berry does have some cute scenes between him and the whale (at one point they start to play volleyball with the whale launching the ball back onto the decks of the boat), there are not enough of them.The movie overall is a lazy effort with a rushed mindset. It ironically comes alive mostly when it is on land and is not so exciting when on the water. And even the usually interesting concluding shots of the whales swimming and leaping freely through the frigid North Pacific waters is disappointing this time around, as they are merely reusing stock shots from the previous two pictures. It's really jarring when at one point the whales are moving behind a blue sky, then a red-laced dusk setting, and then a blue one again.

R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is a prison inmate that thinks time in the psych ward will be easier than on the work farm, so he gets himself committed. We meet McMurphy in his entrance interview with the psychiatrist. This is one of the few times that we see the doctor in the film, and this speaks to the state of mental institutions of the time. The rebellion theme starts early with the exchange between Mac and Nurse Ratched. In the early goings, the nurse and Mac butt heads, Ratched striving for order in her ward, and Mac acting as the troublemaker of the ward. If this was the only story line for the film, it would fail to keep your attention, because, let's face it, this isn't a new story. What really draws you in is the attachment Mac establishes with some of his fellow patients, most notably Chief (Will Sampson). This relationship really puts Mac in a position of endearment, as he spends a concerted amount of effort to draw the big man out of his shell. It's clear that it is a ploy to cement his mental defect for the staff, and ensure his ability to serve out the remainder of his sentence on the ward. The turning point for me on that relationship is once Mac discovers that his time is no longer the finite term he was sentenced to. At that point he could have reestablished his sanity and left the nuts alone, but he didn't.The film establishes the main conflict between Nurse Ratched and McMurphy through the use of close-ups between the nurse and Mac in the first introduction between the two in a group session. I usually find lingering close-ups like this to be more of a distraction than an aid to a film, but was pleasantly surprised to find this use actually accentuates both characters. I think this has a lot to do with the lack of any kind of establishing back story of any depth. Without that back story, we only have the characters reactions to each other, and their surroundings to gain a connection to the characters.Ultimately, the establishment wins with McMurphy, but loses Chief. From hopping the fence to take the group fishing to bringing girls and booze onto the ward, McMurphy fought the structure at every turn. I think we were expected to believe that McMurphy was in fact insane, I felt like McMurphy ended up trying to champion this group of men.

And I saw this after a night of deep and scary immersion in the original Alien world which in several Dune-related ways led to Bladerunner, and that dystopian future convinced as something used by people and with its own organic damage. This is plain goofy, the entire logic behind it.And I have to wonder about Kurt Russell, who apparently brought real commitment to this role - probably trusting that Peoples had written something that would merit the months of rigorous exercise. His character is the age-old 'silent badass', but PW Anderson can muster none of the wonderful self-awareness of Carpenter's two Escape films that would make this character stand out as the product of the most sincere fiction.Everything about him in this world of planet-dumps and genetically-engineered super-soldiers is so self-serious, you will probably howl with laughter.It ends with him holding a child and pointing out to a galaxy far, far away.
