It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.' That's the best line in 'The Terminator' and the main reason it works so well. Having events wrenched out of your control is, like being tortured or falsely imprisoned, a basic fear that the movie plays on very effectively. The villain is completely without conscience, and has only one thing on his mind &#x96; to track down Sarah Connor and kill her &#x96; and he keeps on coming, no matter what. The Terminator is a terrifying character, and watching him gun down various innocent people in the relentless pursuit of his quarry gives the film a take-no-prisoners quality that grounds it in reality while also working as an impressively complete time travel story.The movie opens with a brief glimpse of an horrific future, one in which machines have taken over the planet and driven humans almost to the point of extinction. From this future, two men have travelled back through time to 1984 the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a cyborg sent to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose unborn son will lead the human resistance against the machines; and Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a soldier who has to stop the Terminator from succeeding in his mission. At first, the movie is careful to obscure who the bad guy is and exactly what they're both up to, and part of the film's success lies in the slick exposition, which keeps the film tight and exciting. Director and co-writer James Cameron displays an economy that would not be a feature of his later films - at the outset, the film introduces the three main characters efficiently, and from then on no time is wasted the script is tightly structured, the pacing is sure and the story builds carefully.Unlike the megabucks sequel, this isn't a particularly expensive film. The visual effects are rough round the edges, and the stop motion animation effects are dated, but the endoskeleton scenes are still fantastic, and I'll take obvious model shots over obvious CG effects any day. The future war sequences, with huge tanks rolling over human skulls, might not be too slick, but they still have an impact. These scenes were better realised in T2, but they do the job. Brad Fiedel's score works in the same way as John Carpenter's score for 'Halloween' &#x96; simple and effective, pushing along with a cold, ominous, rhythmic repetition that perfectly suits the Terminator's methods.The violence in the movie isn't too bloody, and it certainly isn't gratuitous; a lot of people die, but it's all part of the story. For instance, the most chilling scene in the movie comes when Sarah and Reese have been taken to a police station and the Terminator turns up at the front desk. He hasn't been created for subtle negotiation, so he crashes through the doors in a car and proceeds to walk calmly through the building, shooting anyone who gets in his way. The neutral expression on the Terminator's face as he systematically guns down cop after cop is really quite unsettling, and you're left in no doubt that what Reese has said is true he will never stop until he's done what he came to do. The title character is Schwarzenegger's best role, and good use is made of his imposing physical presence without him having to act too much, which is always a good idea. Kudos to Cameron, though, for not relying on Arnie's massive frame to make him an effective villain, but making his programmed determination the most frightening thing about him. As Reese, Biehn also gets the best role of his career; he's strong but not obviously heroic, and he convinces as a battle-worn soldier. Hamilton, an underused actress whose only memorable roles have been this and Catherine in the excellent 'Beauty and the Beast' series, makes the most of her part, toughening up believably over the course of the film but staying vulnerable enough for us to care about her.While the three leads are taking care of the serious stuff, much of the humour in the film comes from the supporting cast, like Paul Winfield and Lance Henrikson as cops, and Earl Boen as the police psychiatrist. Their interaction and morbid jokes sketch in a bunch of likable characters. Biehn and Henrikson are Cameron favourites; another, Bill Paxton, also appears early on as a punk, while Dick Miller pops up as a gun shop owner, presumably as a holdover from Cameron's days with Roger Corman. The cast is roundly solid, fun to watch and believable.'The Terminator' works because it takes on a gritty tone, places the action in a realistic setting and is heartless with its characters. It's one those movies that, like 'Die Hard', takes characters we like and puts them through the wringer. By the end of the movie, everybody's dirty, scarred and tired. Many of the people we got to know are dead, the survivors are now in a world that's irrevocably changed (something that the sequel built on). This is one of those movies that has you walking carefully out of the room when it's over, checking round corners even though you know there's nothing there. It's that unquestioning Terminator stare as he steps over various bodies in his pursuit that gives the movie much of its effect, and that's what stays with me. Near the start of the movie, since he doesn't know which Sarah Connor he's looking for, he shoots his way through the names in the phone book until he finds the right woman. Cameron has arguably made better films since, but he's never recaptured the efficient simplicity of this one.

The movie is based on a slim premise that can't sustain a feature, although that didn't stop John Hughes from running the formula and his career into the ground with numerous sequels and clones. There are two aspects of this film that are so far superior to the rest of it, they make the movie worth watching.

The house is bursting at the seams with relatives, and when a power cut finds them all waking up late, they leave something behind in the mad rush to the airport &#x96; eight year old Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), who wanders out of his room in the morning to find his family has disappeared. Well, he's not too bothered about that, so he spends time running riot in the house, while devious goings on are afoot in the neighbourhood idiot crooks Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) are planning to rob Kevin's house, but they reckoned without the (ahem) ingenious traps Kevin has set for them, and a slapstick finale ensues.If you're going to believe a single second of this stuff, a lobotomy is required. Hughes has to fill his set-up with so many contrivances and coincidences to make it 'work' that all credibility goes flying out the window five minutes into the movie. The adults and kids are separated on the plane, so no one notices Kevin's missing. Then the phones don't work, so Kevin's parents (Catherine O'Hara and John Heard) can't call the house. And the neighbours are all on holiday, so no one can check on Kevin. Then the cops call round, but he doesn't answer the door. Hughes twists the plot round his neck in order for the premise to take hold, and the liberties he takes render the whole thing unbelievable. This early stuff is kind of fun, but annoyingly stupid.So we enter the next stage of the movie, in which Kevin takes advantage of being alone in the house by eating loads of ice cream, poking around in his brother's room, using his dad's aftershave, doing the shopping, and shouting a lot while running around and waving his arms. All of this is tedious and unfunny, and it's not helped along by Culkin's lack of charm and acting ability. The movie expects to get mileage out of Hughes' tried and tested method of writing for kids have them be wise beyond their years and full of snappy comebacks (shame none of them are funny). Hughes can't think of anything in particular to happen here, so the movie just kills time until the violence kicks in.Oh yeah, the violence. Once Hughes and director Chris Columbus have exhausted at least one or two possibilities of what could happen to a kid on his own, the movie changes direction so fast you might get whiplash Harry and Marv finally get their asses in gear and break into the house. Unfortunately for them and the tone of the movie, Kevin suddenly turns into the son of Jigsaw and rigs the house with numerous traps that the two goons stumble into. This part of the movie comes on like 'The Omen' crossed with Tom and Jerry, and it's genuinely uncomfortable to watch.Never mind that the traps aren't very clever. What's funny about a guy standing on a nail? Or having the imprint of a doorknob burnt into his hand? Or getting shot in the balls with an air rifle? Or getting brained with an iron? This kind of thing needs charm and the personality of a Stan and Ollie classic to sell it, but rather than the slapstick resulting in a loss of dignity or all kinds of sillness, it just looks extremely painful. When Harry and Marv slip on icy steps, they spend the next two minutes moaning and groaning, and the comedy effect just disappears. Whatever the flaws of the preceding two acts, at least they had a nice seasonal atmosphere. This stuff is just sadistic. It doesn't help that the pacing is slack as anything. But as I said at the top, there are two great things about this movie. One of them is John Williams' score, which avoids the kind of twee pap he spurts out for Spielberg and adds a lot of magic to the film. Some of the music is absolutely beautiful (and extra points for the use of 'Carol of the Bells'). It's better listened to without the movie attached to it, but the twinkly, evocative and Christmassy music is far better than the film deserves. The other great thing, and my favourite part of the film, is the poignant performance of Roberts Blossom as a lonely snow shoveller who befriends Kevin. I defy anyone's heart not to break in two at the look on his face when the kids close the curtains as he looks up at them. The scene in the church, when he talks about how he and his son stopped talking, made me cry and I'm not ashamed to say so. He's just fantastic, and sweeps away all the movie's problems when he's on screen.So, it really doesn't come together.

The movie is based on a slim premise that can't sustain a feature, although that didn't stop John Hughes from running the formula and his career into the ground with numerous sequels and clones. There are two aspects of this film that are so far superior to the rest of it, they make the movie worth watching. But otherwise, forget it.It's Christmas, and the McAllister family are jetting off to Paris for the holidays. The house is bursting at the seams with relatives, and when a power cut finds them all waking up late, they leave something behind in the mad rush to the airport &#x96; eight year old Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), who wanders out of his room in the morning to find his family has disappeared. Well, he's not too bothered about that, so he spends time running riot in the house, while devious goings on are afoot in the neighbourhood idiot crooks Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) are planning to rob Kevin's house, but they reckoned without the (ahem) ingenious traps Kevin has set for them, and a slapstick finale ensues.If you're going to believe a single second of this stuff, a lobotomy is required. Hughes has to fill his set-up with so many contrivances and coincidences to make it 'work' that all credibility goes flying out the window five minutes into the movie. The adults and kids are separated on the plane, so no one notices Kevin's missing. Then the phones don't work, so Kevin's parents (Catherine O'Hara and John Heard) can't call the house. And the neighbours are all on holiday, so no one can check on Kevin. Then the cops call round, but he doesn't answer the door. Hughes twists the plot round his neck in order for the premise to take hold, and the liberties he takes render the whole thing unbelievable. This early stuff is kind of fun, but annoyingly stupid.So we enter the next stage of the movie, in which Kevin takes advantage of being alone in the house by eating loads of ice cream, poking around in his brother's room, using his dad's aftershave, doing the shopping, and shouting a lot while running around and waving his arms. All of this is tedious and unfunny, and it's not helped along by Culkin's lack of charm and acting ability. The movie expects to get mileage out of Hughes' tried and tested method of writing for kids have them be wise beyond their years and full of snappy comebacks (shame none of them are funny). Hughes can't think of anything in particular to happen here, so the movie just kills time until the violence kicks in.Oh yeah, the violence. Once Hughes and director Chris Columbus have exhausted at least one or two possibilities of what could happen to a kid on his own, the movie changes direction so fast you might get whiplash Harry and Marv finally get their asses in gear and break into the house. Unfortunately for them and the tone of the movie, Kevin suddenly turns into the son of Jigsaw and rigs the house with numerous traps that the two goons stumble into. This part of the movie comes on like 'The Omen' crossed with Tom and Jerry, and it's genuinely uncomfortable to watch.Never mind that the traps aren't very clever. What's funny about a guy standing on a nail? Or having the imprint of a doorknob burnt into his hand? Or getting shot in the balls with an air rifle? Or getting brained with an iron? This kind of thing needs charm and the personality of a Stan and Ollie classic to sell it, but rather than the slapstick resulting in a loss of dignity or all kinds of sillness, it just looks extremely painful. When Harry and Marv slip on icy steps, they spend the next two minutes moaning and groaning, and the comedy effect just disappears. Whatever the flaws of the preceding two acts, at least they had a nice seasonal atmosphere. This stuff is just sadistic. It doesn't help that the pacing is slack as anything. But as I said at the top, there are two great things about this movie. One of them is John Williams' score, which avoids the kind of twee pap he spurts out for Spielberg and adds a lot of magic to the film. Some of the music is absolutely beautiful (and extra points for the use of 'Carol of the Bells'). It's better listened to without the movie attached to it, but the twinkly, evocative and Christmassy music is far better than the film deserves. The other great thing, and my favourite part of the film, is the poignant performance of Roberts Blossom as a lonely snow shoveller who befriends Kevin. I defy anyone's heart not to break in two at the look on his face when the kids close the curtains as he looks up at them. The scene in the church, when he talks about how he and his son stopped talking, made me cry and I'm not ashamed to say so. He's just fantastic, and sweeps away all the movie's problems when he's on screen.So, it really doesn't come together. Hughes should have either made the entire plot about Harry and Marv's attempts to get into the house, or found something more interesting and less cruel for Kevin to do until his parents get home.

How 'The Haunting' got a reputation for being an understated horror movie when it's chock full of obvious, over-baked dialogue like that laughable example is something of a mystery to me.

The main focus of the story is Nell, who wants to escape her old life and thinks this may be the way to do it, although the main focus for me was the counter on my DVD player, which I looked at once every ten seconds or so, willing the film to be over. Despite the critical tongue-lashing regularly dished out to this boring movie, the average episode of 'Scooby Doo' has more interesting ambiguity over whether we're seeing a real ghost or not.Ooh, say the film's fans, look the way 'The Haunting' manages to suggest everything, to merely hint at horror without relying on effects and loads of ghosts. Er, what? The last thing this over-the-top loudmouth of a movie does is hint at anything. There may not be much in the way of visual hammering but we are, however, treated to a hundred minutes or so of maddeningly patronising dialogue that packs itself into every last nook and cranny, plus an abundance of repetitious voice-over letting us in on Nell's inner thoughts.

The only vaguely subtle moments come from the relationship between Nell and Theo, which isn't interesting but does at least give you a quiet moment in between the endless chatter, feverish music and banging noises to wipe the blood from your ears.Aside from Julie Harris's over-twitchy performance, none of the actors bother to invest much feeling in their characters, opting instead to monotonously drone out the stone-cold dialogue as if they were talking into a dictaphone. Robert Wise must have thought, 'Blimey, these actors are a bit crap. I'd better completely overdo the direction in the hope that no one will notice,' perfectly complementing the concrete block of a script and Nell endlessly banging on the whole time.

I think the overall storyline is very good, it is just the way it is told, too many filler scenes that are extremely, slow, boring and do nothing for the overall plot. In particular the Heist sequence was done so terribly, they introduce members of the heist and minutes later the heist ended and members started spending money, moments later they all end up dead. This whole angle was rushed and so poorly handled. . The love story between Henry and Karen was also slow and took too long to develop and the affair angle was so fast you blinked you misses it. When Henry was arrested the second time, they handled it with a series of jumbled up scenes, that could have been handled in half the time.Add to that the constant and annoying narration. Scorsose likes that style of storytelling, the one with narration but it is way too much here, and occasionally they would pause certain scenes and Liotta would narrate which breaks the flow of the movie, many scenes are events are explained with narration.Ray Liotta is decent in his protagonist but the other two protagonists De Niro and Joe Pesci.

The epitome of a post-'Rambo', pre-'Die Hard' action movie, its 18 certificate belies the fact that it's clearly aimed at 15-year-olds who, at my school anyway, latched on to the pussy jokes and tough one-liners in the mistaken belief that it made them sound hard. The movie makes the same mistake, and there's only so much grimacing and swaggering you can take before it all gets tiresome. 'Predator' is one big cinematic hard-on.Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Dutch, the leader of a crack army unit sent deep into the jungle on a rescue mission. In his team is Mac (Bill Duke), Blain (Jesse Ventura), Billy (Sonny Landham) and Poncho (Richard Chaves), plus Dutch's old buddy Dillon (Carl Weathers). There's also Hawkins, played by 'Lethal Weapon' screenwriter Shane Black, who asked for a role in an action movie when he sold that screenplay. Anyway, after much gunfire, a bit more gunfire and some additional gunfire, the team begin to realise that someone &#x96; or something &#x96; is in the jungle with them. It's an alien hunter with chameleonic abilities, who's hunting them down for sport, just in case you were wondering, and so the men are bumped off one by one. The creature is sort of a Preddy Krueger.If you're going to make a movie like 'Predator' then you need to include the following clichés 1) shots of helicopters sweeping over the jungle accompanied by a rock and roll song; 2) macho banter, preferably including words like 'pussy' and 'faggot'; 3) tough guys chewing tobacco and smoking really big, phallic cigars; 4) weapons bigger than the characters holding them; 5) male bonding via insults and arm wrestling; 6) action figure names like Duke, Poncho, Buck, Chunky or whatever; and 7) ridiculously manly dialogue like 'I ain't got time to bleed,' and 'You lose it here... you're in a world of hurt,' uttered through clenched teeth. This stuff is taken to the extreme when Dutch prepares to take on the predator by coating himself in mud, lighting a torch, standing on a cliff and howling into the night; basically he gets laughably primal.Add to this Dillon trying to kill the predator after his arm's been blown off, Billy cutting his chest with a whacking great hunting knife, Mac snapping his razor by pressing it too hard on his face, a few gags like 'Knock knock' when Dutch bursts into a hut and shoots everyone and 'Stick around' as he pins a guy to a wall with a huge knife, throw in half the plot of 'Aliens', and you pretty much have the whole movie. The end credits undo some of the film's hard work, with the actors doing those 'Hey there!' smiling-at-the-camera moves so beloved of cheesy title sequences from Eighties TV shows. But for the first hour, before boredom sets in, 'Predator' isn't a bad movie, quite enjoyable in its own way, with a likable performance from Arnie, even if he is out of his depth up against better actors.The undoubted highlight is the predator itself, another fine creation from the studios of Stan Winston. Even though it's a tall-man-in-a-suit job, it looks really cool and the movie at least manages to find a new spin on the killing machine alien concept &#x96; he's basically a big game hunter, drawn by the heat and treating humans like humans treat animals. Another good thing is Alan Silvestri's score, which is mostly Al-by-numbers but gives us a memorable theme tune and even manages to find some moments of poignancy in amongst all the shooting and shouting.There's a protracted sequence when all the guys are blasting the jungle to pieces trying to kill the predator; it goes on and on, loads of firing guns, yelling soldiers and trees getting shot to pieces.

Every summer there's always a box office hit like Dark Knight or The Avengers that we'll all want to see with comic book films being the modern epics of cinema. But before Joss Whedon formed the avengers, before Raimi brought the web slinger to motion and even before Burton brought the Batman to the big screen, Richard Donner was the first to bring superheroes to the screen in epic form with the 1978 smash hit Superman.There were others beforehand such as the 1966 Batman, but this was the first major comic book success on the big screen. One of the main reasons for this is that it was the first time Hollywood was treating comic books seriously. Whilst films like Batman were funny, Superman was the first Superhero film to tap the potential of the comics, largely because of the great writing in the film with the likes of Mario Puzo focusing on bringing the comics to the big screen maintaining the epic character in all his greatness.The writing nails all the key aspects of the character in the film. They maintain his godlike powers, but at the same time still show there are limits to his powers as well, as we do see him go through struggles throughout the film. But more importantly he maintains Superman's perfect ideals throughout the film showing just how far he'll go to saving every life and making it his duty to protect all from a cat in a tree to stopping an earthquake he has to do it all.But obviously not all the credit goes to the writers to bringing the character to life, with Christopher Reeve doing nothing short of bringing the epic character to life on screen. It's one of those truly great times when the role has been perfectly cast. He even looks just like the comics with the right face and muscles to look just like the last son of Krypton. Plus when he's Clarke Kent he has an entirely different presence on screen, successfully demonstrating his knowledge of the character. Then there's the finer details such as the way he majestically flies through the air is really an awesome sight.It's also a real testament to the effort put in to the film that a lot of the special effects that went in to the film still hold up pretty well today. Largely because there's a certain beauty in the way Superman flies. One of the best examples is a classic one shot take in the film where Superman flies off screen and Clarke Kent walks back on. Whilst it is awesome to see the bullet speed Man of Steel, it can't be denied that there is something so iconic about how Superman flies in the film which helps it to really stand the test of time.That's not to say everything in the film still holds up well today. For example, Lois Lane's character is now pretty annoying. She's a mixture of 3 personalities. Being rude and obnoxious for no good reason, being love struck for superman and being a screaming victim. Seriously, I'd bet that if you were to cut together all her scenes in the film she'd spend around a third of her time doing nothing but screaming... There's also some of the comedy between Luthor and Otis. It's funny but it seems out of place more belonging in a Laurel and Hardy sketch then a Superman film. Also it seems odd that Luthor would keep a henchman who repeatedly screws up time and time again.Then there's the end of the film with Superman literally turning back time by spinning the earth backwards. Yeah, out of all the film this is the part that doesn't hold up well. Partly because of the lack of logic (if it happened we'd all probably just fly off the earth) but also because it gets the ideology wrong as not even Superman can do everything. But it's also laughably ludicrous and unnecessary making it by far the weakest part of the film.But overall there is no denying that Superman not only stands as one of the first Superhero movies, but also as one of the best.

For one thing, it would not have lit the fuse to the explosion of other unique slasher villains that everyone comes to know and enjoy at the movies. As crazy as this idea was back in the day, Hitchcock was able to push the boundaries of suspense and create a legend that practically no one can forget. Thankfully everything here is put together in such a way that it amounts to a very clever, creepy and disturbing movie.The story is about a girl named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who is given a huge sum of money and is expected to deposit in the bank. However, she becomes greedy and decides to run off with it. While on her escape, she decides to rest at an old motel owned by a man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). There she learns that Norman is under the strict rule of his mother and that he's a slight bit unsettling. However, she doesn't realize how unsettling Norman really is. Co-starring Perkins and Leigh are several other veteran actors like Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam and John McIntire.The writing is based off of Robert Bloch's work of the same name.

Every scene that is depicted gives momentum to the plot and helps make the tension that much more gripping. The best actor here is Anthony Perkins. Not only are his reactions real but also feel genuine. For example, when telling a lie and then being found out, he tries to cover his tracks. He is able to do so but speaks nervously. As for the year, 1960 had some graphic violence come into play. Not enough to shock anyone, but creative enough to let the audiences' imagination run wild. Also, just because the film is in black and white doesn't mean for any viewer who doesn't like the old films, can't be entertained either. With the simplicity of color, there are other things for the viewer to watch and notice. Having only black and white actually simplifies the viewing experience for the audience.

Here audiences witness director Sean S. Cunningham dish out his first actual film that everyone remembers even though, this isn't his first time directing. However, what makes this film feel painstakingly similar to that Halloween (1978) is the whole concept in general. Screenwriter Victor Miller even stated himself that he was just riding the coat tales of John Carpenter's movie. Surprisingly though, as much as this sounds like it could be bad, it actually isn't.The story runs along the same lines as every other slasher horror film - a group teenagers are stalked and picked off by a mysterious killer. However, this time it takes place in a campsite, not suburbia. Also, the fact of how the story plays out is still respectable despite being sampled from Halloween (1978). This allows the movie to stand on it's own without coming up too much as a copycat. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the whole story is the mysterious background surrounding the camp. The real name of the camp is called Camp Crystal Lake, but the folks who live nearby call it Camp Blood. Gee, that sounds real ominous. However, it's not only this aspect but the tragic story of a boy who drowned there as well.Starring in this movie are a bunch of no name actors and one who would become real popular among fans. The one everyone knows of now is Kevin Bacon. The rest would either drop out completely of film or continue for a little and then fade away. What's with these actors? There are too many films where convincing actors star in an entertaining film and then drop out completely after that film was released. The two actors I wish had continued their careers were Robbi Morgan as Annie and Jeannine Taylor as Marcie. Along with them are convincing performances by the other unknown actors. Betsy Palmer is probably the most convincing due to her character's mentality.For violence, gore fans should be relatively satisfied. It still is not the over-the-top actions that one would see in today's slasher movies, but it delivers; perhaps some moments viewers may not expect. I know there was one scene I didn't see coming. One aspect to the film that helps it stand on its own is the cinematography by Barry Abrams. Throughout the daylight parts of the film, Abrams captures a lot of good shots of the nature surrounding the camp. Adding to that is composer Harry Manfredini's score. If there's one thing that Manfredini got right, it's the whispering voices throughout the running time. It helps give the setting a very ghostly feel. Music wise, Manfredini relies more on screeching strings and not creating actual tunes. It isn't all too effective in most places, but there are times where he does create a tune here and there. It's just not often enough. This is still an entertaining film.It certainly is not the newest of concepts considering that it took much of its premise from Halloween (1978), but it's atmosphere and story are interesting enough that it shouldn't be turned down. Also watch it for a young Kevin Bacon.

Its Woody Allen at his best. And its a romantic comedy at its best. Instantly from the beginning it reminded me of the recent 500 days of summer. Not only because it basically gives away the ending from the opening scene, but because it did a lot for the rom-com genre as a whole. It has a lot to say for life, romance, and even to a certain extent death. But really the trademark of the film is that love fades, and it is extremely difficult for people to continue a relationship for a long period of time.Out of the small amount of Woody Allen movies I've seen I think this one might be my favorite. Allen is always good at writing characters that seem to work perfectly together even if on the outside it seems far fetched. Alvy and Annie don't seem like a regular couple in fact in real life I'm not sure their personalities fit. But for some reason it makes sense in the movie. The sense of realism that Allen brings to his characters is always refreshing. Everyone has flaws and sometimes in movies we fall in love with the perfect human being, when nobody is perfect, not even close. So when a filmmaker helps us realize that perfection shouldn't be expected for a relationship, you really appreciate the guts they have. Too often do we get our happy ending that isn't realistic at all.As Allen tells us from the opening scene, him and Annie aren't the same as they used to be. Love just fades, and there's not much we can do to stop that. We should just all hope we find the person that the love is everlasting instead. I think Diane Keaton was the best part about this film, and for me she created one of the coolest movie characters of that time. For many people, the parts of the movie that see the characters jump back in time and flat out talk to people is the funniest and most entertaining scenes.

Well, the direction in that movie was so demented, and the acting so hammy, and the score so over-the-top that it all became pretty laughable. You might not see a ghost, but the tone was so delirious that the so-called 'suggestion' was far from from subtle. Thirty-six years later we have the remake, which rockets past subtle in the first five minutes and keeps on going.Liam Neeson is David Morrow, a doctor conducting research into the mechanics of fear, who invites a bunch of people &#x96; Nell (Lilli Taylor), Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Luke (Owen Wilson) &#x96; to a creepy old mansion on the pretext of researching insomnia when he really wants to scare the crap out of them and see what happens. Needless to say, the house has a dark history and pretty soon the haunting becomes all too real for our cardboard friends, and Nell in particular, who tries to find out what's going on. The basic idea behind what's causing all the goings-on is a good one, but there's so much stuff piled on top of it it's impossible to care. This is a movie that's been constructed, not created, and it turns out to be a soulless machine that doesn't let you think for yourself.For a start, I lose patience with any movie that feels the need to have the characters supply a running commentary on what's happening, and 'The Haunting' can't hint at it or let you figure it out. There's a bit where Nell's name is scrawled in blood in foot-high letters on a wall, and she helpfully says, 'That's my name.' Another scene has her discovering a book containing the names of various dead children, and she proceeds to read out all their ages, even though there are shots of the text as she does so. This kind of thing plagued Jan De Bont's previous movie, 'Speed 2', with characters helpfully yelling things like, 'The boat's tipping over!' when the boat was tipping over. Using this device is fine if done do it sparingly, but here it's relentless.The movie is also so obsessed with its bullying soundscape that it forgets to include any build-up or atmosphere. As soon as everyone enters the house, the soundtrack cranks up to maximum eardrum penetration and is weighed down with moans, groans and various other continual distractions that are presumably meant to supply a feeling of foreboding but instead become so overused that it's wearisome. There's a scene where Nell and Theo become trapped in a room, and the air gets cold, and then the doors start banging like someone's breaking in, and they're screaming, and the sound effects are booming away. Later, they decide it was all down to noisy pipes. Stuff like this just makes the characters look stupid and the audience feel insulted.The visual effects are fine, but overbearing. There's a really lovely moment when the outline of a child billows through a curtain, but then the shape continues up the bed and onto Nell's pillow, where the kid talks to her (watch her reaction to this &#x96; there isn't one), and it spoils the effect. There's a great bit in the trailer where a statue reaches out its arms, but in the context of the movie it just becomes one more effect in an unending barrage. There's another nice bit, when wooden carvings of children's faces change expressions. Unfortunately, little creepy bits like that are offset by bombastic stuff like when the ceiling becomes a face, and starts to fall inwards, and pins Nell to the bed, with plenty of noise. Strangely enough, the others hear her screaming but not the room taking on another form. At first I thought that was because it was all in her head, but then it turns out to have happened in reality and makes the whole scene seem ridiculous.The acting and direction leave a lot to be desired. Taylor's good, but otherwise you could almost forget there were any other actors in the movie. De Bont's direction of the actors is hopeless. When Neeson is confronted with a huge ghostly face staring at him from the caved-in ceiling, he looks vaguely bothered rather than scared out his wits as he should be. Most of the time the reactions come across as though De Bont forgot to tell everyone the effects would be put in later. Neeson gets nearly all the rubbish stuff in this movie; he barely does anything sensible at all. Zeta-Jones' first few lines basically amount to, 'Hi, I'm bisexual, bit of a tease, wink wink,' which is clumsy and fails to lead anywhere. Wilson's character serves no particular purpose, and Bruce Dern has next to nothing to do in a brief role as the house's caretaker.The house is the one thing this movie really has going for it. It's a beautiful creation, and production designer Eugenio Zanetti has done a great job. There's imagination and detail all over the place, and it's the only thing that holds your attention while everything else blares around you. While statues are trying to drown people, and staircases are falling apart, and doors are growing hands, and skeletons are leaping out at people, and the sound is bellowing with all the scares of a cheese sandwich, your time's better spent taking in the gorgeous, eerie design work of the house, and wishing a better movie took place in it.

","genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"16 May 2014","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The original version of 'The Haunting' is famous for its power of suggestion in place of special effects, for scaring you without showing you much. Well, the direction in that movie was so demented, and the acting so hammy, and the score so over-the-top that it all became pretty laughable. You might not see a ghost, but the tone was so delirious that the so-called 'suggestion' was far from from subtle. Thirty-six years later we have the remake, which rockets past subtle in the first five minutes and keeps on going.Liam Neeson is David Morrow, a doctor conducting research into the mechanics of fear, who invites a bunch of people &#x96; Nell (Lilli Taylor), Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Luke (Owen Wilson) &#x96; to a creepy old mansion on the pretext of researching insomnia when he really wants to scare the crap out of them and see what happens. Needless to say, the house has a dark history and pretty soon the haunting becomes all too real for our cardboard friends, and Nell in particular, who tries to find out what's going on. The basic idea behind what's causing all the goings-on is a good one, but there's so much stuff piled on top of it it's impossible to care. This is a movie that's been constructed, not created, and it turns out to be a soulless machine that doesn't let you think for yourself.For a start, I lose patience with any movie that feels the need to have the characters supply a running commentary on what's happening, and 'The Haunting' can't hint at it or let you figure it out. There's a bit where Nell's name is scrawled in blood in foot-high letters on a wall, and she helpfully says, 'That's my name.' Another scene has her discovering a book containing the names of various dead children, and she proceeds to read out all their ages, even though there are shots of the text as she does so. This kind of thing plagued Jan De Bont's previous movie, 'Speed 2', with characters helpfully yelling things like, 'The boat's tipping over!' when the boat was tipping over. Using this device is fine if done do it sparingly, but here it's relentless.The movie is also so obsessed with its bullying soundscape that it forgets to include any build-up or atmosphere. As soon as everyone enters the house, the soundtrack cranks up to maximum eardrum penetration and is weighed down with moans, groans and various other continual distractions that are presumably meant to supply a feeling of foreboding but instead become so overused that it's wearisome. There's a scene where Nell and Theo become trapped in a room, and the air gets cold, and then the doors start banging like someone's breaking in, and they're screaming, and the sound effects are booming away. Later, they decide it was all down to noisy pipes. Stuff like this just makes the characters look stupid and the audience feel insulted.The visual effects are fine, but overbearing. There's a really lovely moment when the outline of a child billows through a curtain, but then the shape continues up the bed and onto Nell's pillow, where the kid talks to her (watch her reaction to this &#x96; there isn't one), and it spoils the effect. There's a great bit in the trailer where a statue reaches out its arms, but in the context of the movie it just becomes one more effect in an unending barrage. There's another nice bit, when wooden carvings of children's faces change expressions. Unfortunately, little creepy bits like that are offset by bombastic stuff like when the ceiling becomes a face, and starts to fall inwards, and pins Nell to the bed, with plenty of noise. Strangely enough, the others hear her screaming but not the room taking on another form. At first I thought that was because it was all in her head, but then it turns out to have happened in reality and makes the whole scene seem ridiculous.The acting and direction leave a lot to be desired. Taylor's good, but otherwise you could almost forget there were any other actors in the movie. De Bont's direction of the actors is hopeless. When Neeson is confronted with a huge ghostly face staring at him from the caved-in ceiling, he looks vaguely bothered rather than scared out his wits as he should be. Most of the time the reactions come across as though De Bont forgot to tell everyone the effects would be put in later. Neeson gets nearly all the rubbish stuff in this movie; he barely does anything sensible at all. Zeta-Jones' first few lines basically amount to, 'Hi, I'm bisexual, bit of a tease, wink wink,' which is clumsy and fails to lead anywhere. Wilson's character serves no particular purpose, and Bruce Dern has next to nothing to do in a brief role as the house's caretaker.The house is the one thing this movie really has going for it. It's a beautiful creation, and production designer Eugenio Zanetti has done a great job. There's imagination and detail all over the place, and it's the only thing that holds your attention while everything else blares around you. While statues are trying to drown people, and staircases are falling apart, and doors are growing hands, and skeletons are leaping out at people, and the sound is bellowing with all the scares of a cheese sandwich, your time's better spent taking in the gorgeous, eerie design work of the house, and wishing a better movie took place in it.

I've tried and tried, but it's not my cup of tea at all. I can see why audiences were amazed by this movie at the time, but was only 1933 for, oh, roughly a year, and nowadays 'King Kong' is looking pretty musty. It doesn't have that timeless quality that keeps other movies of the same era as fresh today as they ever were, but it does have bad acting, a pace as plodding as Kong himself, scenes that go on far too long and nary a sense of wonder. But it does have some interesting animation and the lovely Fay Wray, who we see a bit more of than she probably intended in the scene where she's being pulled out of the water.It all starts when film director Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) sets sail for an uncharted island, see? He got the location from a skipper who fished a man out of the sea and was able to get a bit of information out of him before he died &#x96; this snippet includes a perfectly drawn map showing the exact shape of the island, which isn't bad going for a man at death's door. So, along with starlet Ann Darrow (Wray), sexist sailor Jack (Bruce Cabot) and the ship's large crew, Denham sets off to this island to make a picture, see? When they reach their destination, they find it's inhabited by a tribe who have built a huge wall separating them from the rest of the island, and seem to be sacrificing a woman to whatever god they worship. When they kidnap Ann and set her up on a blind date with their god, we see he's a thirty-foot gorilla &#x96; the dreaded King Kong!This is pretty bizarre stuff, isn't it? Massive monkey terrorises islanders! Oddly, the door in the natives' wall is big enough to let Kong through, which seems to be a bit of a design flaw. But it enables Denham to lure Kong to the beach, and the beast is promptly knocked out and taken to New York, where Denham predicts he'll make big bucks by exhibiting him. But this is a Man Meddles With Nature story, so Kong dutifully busts loose and rampages through the city, looking for Ann. I find it quite strange that this movie has become a so-called 'classic' because apart from a so-what 'Beauty and the Beast' plot line and better production values, there's not much difference between this and something like 'The Land That Time Forgot'. It's cinematic heresy, I know, comparing this to a Doug McClure movie, but the only thing that's missing IS Doug McClure.Just check out Denham's lame reaction when he comes across a stegosaurus 'Hey, look at that,' he says, amazement etched into his every word, 'it's something from the dinosaur family.' Pin sharp, this guy. 'Dinosaur, eh?' says Jack, equally stunned by the presence of a supposedly long-extinct creature on the island. Not being the most ecologically-minded fellows, they of course shoot the creature dead, making sure to blow its brains out as it lies helplessly on the ground. Good old Denham's a bit of an asshole, really at the end of the movie, when Kong has been shot down from the Empire State Building, he famously muses, 'Oh no, it wasn't the airplanes. It was beauty killed the beast.' No mate, it was you gassing him and dragging him off to a city, thereby allowing him to destroy property and kill numerous innocent people. Show some remorse. Yeah?Of course the main talking point of this movie will always be the special effects, since the wooden acting and saggy story are nothing to get excited about. Willis O'Brien's pioneering stop motion animation is impressive, and seeing the joins doesn't stop the integration between the models and the live action being very clever. The Kong-goes-mental scenes must have taken forever to get right, especially the timing when he interacts with the live action foreground. By far the best part of the movie is Kong's New York walkabout, particularly the bit where he rips apart a railway line, causing a derailment. There are two really horrible scenes, one where Kong shakes a log some of the men are holding onto, sending them plummeting into a ravine; and another one where he plucks a woman out of her bed and throws her to the ground.But the acting, pacing and music are so boring! The script seems to have been typed up with no full stops in it, so the actors just blare out their lines in those grating foghorn voices of theirs. The male characters are a bunch of sexist pigs, which makes the film a product of its era, of course, but it's obnoxiously placed front and centre in the early stages and it makes most of the central characters look like idiots.On and on it goes. The stuff on the boat getting to the island takes a long time. The hunt for Kong through the jungle takes a long time. Then Kong has a fight with a dinosaur, which takes a long time, and then he duffs up a giant snake, which also takes a long time. Oh, and then he fights a pterodactyl, which... you get the idea. There's not much variety here, is there? Kong beats up a giant monster, a giant monster and a giant monster. All accompanied by the soupy score, which produced that dreary ache in the back of my head that tells me I'm not having a good time. If this was shorter, less boring, less misogynistic, had better dialogue and acting, a different score and wasn't so repetitious, then I could probably begin to see why some people regard it as a great movie.

","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"16 May 2014","score":"","review":" From what I understand and from hints in the movie Ed Wood by Tim Burton, Ed Wood created this movie based on the last footage he ever shot of Bela Lugosi. I recently just watched the colorized version, which adds a lot more dimension to the film. All I can say is the dialog in this film is superior to many recent films, especially Star Wars Episodes 1-III.Basically Ed Wood's premise for this film was superior for 1953, he just lacked the resources to make it well. He blended in Stock Footage with his framing story well and his editing was actually rather good. The parts he shot himself have good audio and decent film grade, so it's not really that shoddy. And it is also LIT well. This is one of the earliest true Zombie movies ever made.And when it comes right down to content, some of Ed Wood's Science - It's not really that implausible compared to other films where I had to stretch my imagination, I can suspend disbelief due to how the Ruler of the Galaxy and the other aliens explain the mechanism they are using to raise the great Tor Johnson from the dead and remote-control his body- And then Waporise him later.Wood, like Hitchcock before him, knew how to not show something to get the same effect as showing it, and it works here- We don't see Bela Logosi's Ghoul getting vaporized, but we easily see that it happened. The same trick was used in Seven Men from now by Bud Beotticher- in the light-speed gunfight between Lee Marvin and Randolph Scott, Randolph Scott is shown to have an amazing quick-draw speed, simply by not showing him drawing his gun. Wood uses that same Fakery in this film.What is amazing is that I can see two guys in Pilots's uniform sitting in a obvious cardboard set, but you BELIEVE they are flying an Airplane.I don't consider Wood as a great director, he was adequate. He was better than some directors of today that get handed billion dollar projects on a regular basis. If this film had been adequately funded, it would have been another Forbidden Planet- But only if Wood had stuck to writing and producing it, and not also directing.I have to admire the gall of Wood, and in the movie Ed Wood, he seems to have the same kind of friends I have, and that he befriended Bela when nobody in Hollywood would even talk to him, shows what kind of person he really was.This film literally Marries Lugosi to 50's LA Horror host Vampira, so from the time this film was released forward, the two have been synonymous.This also marks the film with possibly the most lines spoken by Tor Johnson, who was a great Character actor in his own right.

Stories about the HIV\/AIDS epidemic and they're coming in the thousands right after brilliant documentary How To Survive a Plague, the stream continued with Dallas Buyers Club, Behind the Candelabra, and the upcoming adaptation of The Normal Heart. They're all heroic, real and influential tellings and they're getting a lot of praise from everybody. Meanwhile, I took the time to look back at the time machine and search for works that were released back in the nightmarish days when the plague was a horrific death sentence and a theme barely touched on the screen. Among those, Les Nuits Fauves (Savage Nights) is one that needs to receive a special attention. It's unlike any of the fore-mentioned titles, it's daring at the same time it's unpleasant, careless, controversial, and it's a different take from almost all the other films of the period. This is the anti-Philadelphia - I make this comparison because they were released very next to each other (the same year in most countries).What you're about to see was a real story, fictionalized at times but real. Its writer, director and main star Cyril Collard exposes a dark truth that frightens, revolts and angers, but he was being truth to himself and to the public. First, with his 1986 novel of same name and then by making this adaptation, huge risks in presenting his story about Jean, a HIV positive cinematographer wanna be director who refuses to deal with his condition, still living a hedonistic and wild life of parties, drugs and sex with both men and women. We focus on two of his lovers the 17 year-old Laura (Rohmane Bohringer), naive and impressionable enough to fall in love with him; and the rugby player Sami (Carlos López), bisexual just like Jean, but they're more into the attraction part than dealing with a love\/hate kind of thing. Torn between these two and also with casual sex encounters with strangers under a Parisian bridge, Jean ignores his disease living as if things never changed, deeply knowing that he is changing, getting affected more and more each day goes by. Everything's resumed into knowing that he's alive and kicking and there's some time to be enjoyed before death. But don't be fooled. Savage Nights is pain after pain, pleasure is very limited. The relation with Sami is a pure escapism since most of the time he's committed with girls and finding time to be join a racist\/homophobic group, beating up people like Jean, where he can release his frustration of not living the same way he did with his criminal father back in Spain; the love affair with Laura is a constant headache, mostly because she doesn't handle well the fact that Jean likes guys (and she knows about Sami). It gets worse when Jean reveals that he's HIV positive and she might be as well because they had unprotected sexual relations. His excuse for not saying it before is unreasonable yet believable (and probably used by many folks out there) he thought she'd never get AIDS because their love is strong and overcomes anything, even a deadly virus. It's the greatest and most difficult scene of the film, and some will focus their anger and hate not on the character but on Collard. I appreciated the film because Collard has given a different perspective on a delicate theme at the time, had a lot of nerve in telling his story (but not necessarily a full factual retelling, there's rumors that the story ended differently for the real girl who inspired Laura) and despite the obstacles faced with his new reality, finding ways to see life with some optimism, grasping to it with the few strength he has and seeing it a little differently. Sure, he's still careless about others and himself, always putting his feelings above the others, including family and friends but now he can truly say he loves his life. Sickness feels less important, the complete opposite of what happens in similar themed films where you see characters slowly succumbing to the disease, which is always on the foreground, preventing them to do anything about it. Collard's adaptation of his own novel doesn't betray his source, though he left out great sequences - the one in Morocco is reduced to bits and pieces, but it was poetic translated in surreal scenes - but the way he conducted its transformation to the screen was very good, small chapters and fragments of a full speeding life that runs towards the inevitable end that never seems to actually feel it. It's a circle of parties, drugs, sex, wild nights, fights and risky business in a city whose corners seems to invite all of those at any given moment.But what's wrong with Savage Nights? It's lack of focus in the disease's progress. The character forgets about his problems and still lives his life but in terms of reality the disease becomes overlooked when it shouldn't. But forget that. What about his message to audiences? I'm positively sure that Collard was simply telling his own story without endorsing or condemning his actions - though anyone else can get easily confused with everything presented there. Let people figure out for themselves. That's what happened but it wasn't very helpful since many critics reacted badly with the movie, others praised it, and the man hasn't lived enough to expose his thoughts, dying a few days earlier of the rain of awards at the Cesar. The enigma stays on with this film testament, who was he and how to describe him and his acts? Rebellious, honest, sickening, hateful, fearless? Hero or villain?

Even those who don't like Woody Allen may find that they might enjoy the film. With the luminous photography showing off the equally striking locations, The Purple Rose of Cairo is one of Allen's most visually stunning films, perhaps second to Manhattan. The music is memorable and understated, having a presence while not being overbearing. Allen's direction is more sympathetic than usual but every bit as thoughtful and assured, there is no signs of self-indulgence. The Purple Rose of Cairo has a truly wonderful script as well, there is the smart and witty touch that has Woody Allen all over it and also a genuine poignancy that has not been matched by many other Allen films. It is also very too the point and doesn't become rambling. The story has themes that anybody in the same situation can relate to, it's steadily paced but the writing, how the characters and their relationships are explored and the heart and truthfulness really captivate here, so it's never tedious. Other than the emotional impact, what makes The Purple Rose of Cairo perhaps one of Allen's most accessible and relatable is that it is one of his least neurotic, but even without that the characters are still compellingly real, which just goes to show that good writing and characters can happen without neurotises(and this is not meant in a bad way, it is a style that doesn't click with many but I've never had a problem with it). The ending is one that may fall flat with some but strike a chord with others, the latter was the case with me, but it is understandable why anybody would think otherwise because it does take a different tone to the rest of the film.
