For many, it was the greatest movie ever made; some patrons were reliably reported to have seen it more than thirty times, and it became by far the highest-grossing production in cinematic history.  But a fairly large minority of people, both in the average film-going public and among the critics, felt that the TITANIC craze was much ado about nothing, and many of them bitterly resented its bloated budget which they felt could have gone to far worthier films.  Two years after its release, the ardency of TITANIC fans is no longer quite so hot, but its detractors seem to grow ever more bitter, and thus a backlash has snapped out against the movie that has driven it from its former place at number one (!) in Internet Movie Database voting to a place completely off the top 250.  It's become passe to like TITANIC, but I still like it.  A whole lot, in fact.  And while I don't think it ever belonged in the #1 spot, ranking it below mediocre stuff like THE PHANTOM MENACE (#199) or FORREST GUMP (#172) just isn't fair.TITANIC is the story of two fictional passengers on the White Star Line's most famous vessel.  Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) is the child of a family high in social class but deeply in debt; Rose's mother (Frances Fisher) plans to rectify this by betrothing Rose to the rich but odious Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).  Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a penniless dock-worker who has won his ticket on the TITANIC in a poker game.  Rose, having gotten a good look at just what her future with Cal Hockley will be like, attempts suicide, but is stopped by Jack, which sparks a brief but memorably passionate romance between them, under the shadow of the disaster we know awaits the ship.If you had told me in 1996 that James Cameron would direct a movie which had no violence or chase scenes for the first two hours, I would have laughed in your face.  I honestly had no idea that Cameron was capable of gentle scenes so rich with humor, affection, and grand spectacle.  The greatest ship ever launched comes to life and we get the grand tour, from the massive, throbbing engines to the graceful swanlike prow.  We get a sense of just how grand this voyage was for all participants, rich or poor.Leonardo DiCaprio shouldn't have been the sole focus of this movie's popularity.  Not that he does a bad job; he always delivers Cameron's sometimes strained lines believably and sincerely, and he does some fine work in a difficult late scene where he has to mix fury and love in the same moment, simultaneously kissing and berating Rose when she stays with him rather than flee in a lifeboat.  But Kate Winslet's performance is the real meat of TITANIC.  Her large liquid eyes can be heart-melting when she wishes.  She perfectly simulates the mixed embarrassment and joy she feels as Jack teaches her to break down the inhibitions that her class and upbringing have placed on her.  And at one point she delivers a kind of stuck for words expression that is so perfect that she couldn't have done it better if she really had forgotten her lines.Billy Zane has a comparatively easy job as the villainous Cal Hockley, it's a one-note role, and Zane plays it that way.  While he's certainly not the most interesting villain ever to appear on screen, comparisons of him to Snidely Whiplash are unfair.  Hockley is not motiveless; he is merely one of those men who thinks of women as property rather than as human beings.  There are millions of Hockleys in the world today, and you can see the wreckage they leave in their wake in any battered women's shelter.  Hockley's character is perfectly realistic, just not particularly deep.My favorite supporting actor in this movie was Victor Garber in the quiet and understated role of Thomas Andrews, TITANIC's shipwright.  Of his many fine moments, the best is his reaction to Bruce Ismay's anguished protest, This ship can't sink!  She's made of iron, sir.  I assure you, she can.  Almost any other actor handed that line would have delivered it with contempt and sarcasm.  But Garber does it more with a mixture of disbelief and real pity, as he realizes that the man he is facing is emotionally incapable of facing reality.TITANIC certainly has many flaws.  The framing story is sometimes mishandled, making the first half hour drag.  The humorous wisecracks, while funny, are often very poorly timed and undercut the drama of the scenes.  Since Cameron has to tell his story during the brief duration of the TITANIC's voyage, Rose's transformation from inhibited prisoner of class expectations to free and independent woman is too hasty.  Cameron also at times seems intent on demonizing the rich just for being rich, a tad hypocritical for a man who risked and made millions on this movie.  And the dialogue has more than its share of melodramatic lines and the odd cliche, though Winslet and DiCaprio deliver it so well that I generally didn't mind.Still, there is great power in Cameron's invitation to become attached to something you know is doomed.  Some refuse to take the risk, but not wisely; everything that you become attached to is doomed, sooner or later.  You get two choices meet your own doom without ever having been attached to something at all, or meet it with at least the memory of how good the ride was while it lasted.Rating  ***1\/2 out of ****.

You'd be hard pressed to put together a bigger piece of cr*p than this Bruce Willis vehicle.Armageddon is the story (and I use that term loosely) of a team of Super-Drillers flying off to destroy an asteroid before it destroys the Earth.  Realistic?  Not really.  But who cares?  It's an action flick.  I'm not blasting the premise.Minor spoilersThe movie begins with a couple of scenes designed to introduce the threat and the characters.  Bruce Willis is the tough-as-nails leader of the team, and spends his first bit of screen time chasing around Ben Affleck with a gun for the unforgiveable act of sleeping with his daughter.  For some reason, that didn't make me laugh.  It was forced, like everything in this movie.The team is called in because they're the only people in the whole wide world who can drill the asteroid.  Okay, I'm prepared to accept that premise if it gets us to the action - the supposed meat of the movie.  More attempts at humor, with each character going out to do some crazy, nutty thing before blast off.  Again, lame.  Finally, they take off.  Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.

Jackson), and their misadventures in the world of murder, crime, and taking the boss's wife out to eat.  (Trust me, this is not as funny as it sounds). Haphazardly intermixed with this is the story of the boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and of Butch (Bruce Willis), a boxer who refuses to throw a fight for Wallace and thus earns his enmity.Some things are not wrong with PULP FICTION.  I do not believe, as some do, that it is intended to glorify violence and drug abuse.  It does play both these things for comic effect, in what I found a very tasteless, vulgar, and unfunny style, but I don't think Tarantino was trying to tell the audience that violence and drug abuse are actually fun and beneficial; inconvenient and inglorious consequences of both are shown quite graphically.  And the acting by Jackson, Rhames, and, yes, Willis is pretty darn good.Nevertheless, PULP FICTION bored me out of my mind.  I was not interested in the characters, because none of them is sympathetic; none feels about the world or reacts to it in any way remotely approaching my own.  And much of the movie is spent in long dialogue that does nothing to advance the plot. To be fair, Tarantino does have an ear for realistic, earthy-sounding phrases.  The lines never sound artificial, forced or strained; they do sound just like the spontaneous banalities that form the backbone of real people's conversations.  But I don't listen to strangers' banal conversations, because they're boring if I don't know the people.  And that's exactly how boring the conversations in PULP FICTION are.PULP FICTION's genius is generally said to lie in its accomplishments as a black comedy.  Well, whatever floats your boat.  I got very few laughs out of this picture.  Interestingly, I always find my friends' re-enactments of their favorite scenes from PULP FICTION to be much funnier than seeing the scenes themselves.  I was amused twice in the final tale by Tarantino's spoofing of movie cliches, as where Jules urged Honeybunny to stay calm, point the gun at me, and where a hapless gunman misses Jules and Vincent with an entire magazine at point blank range, much to all parties' amazement.  But aside from that, the comedy eluded me.  I don't know how anyone could hail lower than lowbrow humor like Christopher Walken's scene as being some kind of comic genius.  Furthermore, realistically brutal violence and comedy don't mix well for my taste.Tarantino does have some imagination handling the camera.  For instance, Vincent at one point is told that Marsellus Wallace had a man thrown off a building for massaging Mrs. Wallace's feet; later, when Vincent meets Mrs. Wallace on orders to take her to a restaurant, the camera never leaves Mrs. Wallace's feet.But Tarantino's imagination often is no more than showing off.  The film's structure appeals to the sort of over-literate viewer for whom the word nonlinear is synonymous with brilliant and artistic.  Not to be a spoilsport, but there's a good reason most movie scripts are arranged in a linear fashion that happens to be the way time flows.  I'm not saying you can't tell a good nonlinear story, but there'd better be a reason for it. And I cannot tell what Tarantino thinks he accomplished by mixing at least five (counting the opening scene) different time sequences together in a seemingly random order.  I was not confused, but many others were, and I don't see what Tarantino gained in exchange for losing them.  One reviewer has suggested this device enabled Tarantino to put Jules' redemption at the end, thus finishing the movie on a positive note.  If this is so, then the conclusion is just as manipulative and intellectually dishonest as any standard tacked-on Hollywood feel-good ending.Not that the ending is really bad; in fact I gave the movie an extra half star for its ending, as I finally became interested in one of the characters.  I would have liked to find out whether Jules succeeded in leaving the criminal life.  Of course, I take self-confessed redemptions with a grain of salt, but since Jules seems to be uncertain himself about whether he'll kick the criminal habit, I can live with that.  But redeemed or not, Jackson couldn't completely redeem this frequently tedious, sometimes nauseating, and rarely funny two and a half hours.Rating ** out of ****.

Who the heck wouldn't keep $4 million that they found because of ethical reasons?  Not many people, and I certainly didn't believe that Hank was one of them.2. Why does this movie use dumb characters to make dumb decisions to complicate the plot?  I realized I disliked this movie when Jacob hits the guy on the snowmobile and then Hank kills him when he realizes that the guy is still alive.  Can you say Out of character?  Why is Raimi presenting us with such a contrived scene that I've seen countless times before as if it's something ingenious that I've never seen before?3. How can two people (Hank and his wife) go from 1 day not wanting to keep the money, to the next day not really caring too much that Hank killed a guy.4. What stupid idea is it to go back to the crime scene?5. Hello? Coroners can easily tell the difference between suffocation versus death by impact.6. The snow hadn't fallen by the time the cops got to the snowmobile accident.  Why didn't they figure anything out?7. What kind of plot twist is it that the FBI agent didn't show the cop his badge?  That's just BAD, BAD, BAD.8. Wouldn't Hank have put his bullets in the gun while he was alone in the woods?9. Can we get rid of the in-your-face animal symbolism?10. I just don't believe that the characters we were presented with in the beginning would have done what they did throughout the movie.  Yes, the point is that money corrupts people, but nowhere did I see any character development showing that.  All of a sudden the characters were all doing things out of character and I was just supposed to accept it.I thought this movie was pretty boring.

I actually kind of prefer it to the original. This movie takes what was introduced in the first movie and expands on it. One of the admirable things about this movie is that they didn't do a retread of the original. While Alien was pretty much a horror movie set on a spaceship, Aliens is more of an action oriented sci-fi movie. The human elements of this movie really add to the film. Ripley decides to confront her fears (brought upon her by the events in the first movie) by going on the mission to the colony and benefits from it by the end of the movie. In the Director's Cut, we learn of Ripley's daughter who died during Ripley's 50-year sleep in the escape pod. This helps in explaining her realtionship with Newt.The direction is excellent and the special effects are superb. The Director's Cut version of this movie adds 17 minutes of footage, where we learn about Ripley's daughter, see Ripley get stripped of her license by the Company, and see further development in the relationship between Ripley and Newt. This extra footage is not simply filler. This is footage that was important to the film and footage that James Cameron had to cut for time. The extra footage really does enhance the movie.WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW......... Like the first movie, Aliens ends in a surprisingly peaceful manner following the chaos in the rest of the film. Only this ending is considerably less bittersweet than the end of Alien. Ripley has faced her fears and overcome the nightmares she's been suffering from them. She's also been blessed with a new family in Hicks and Newt. I was really upset that they were both killed at the beginning of the horrible Alien 3. But I try console myself by telling myself that Alien 3 doesn't exist. Hey, if Highlander fans can deny the existence of the two dreadful sequels, why can't I do the same with the last two Alien movies?This is one of the best Sci-Fi movies of the 80's and a true testimony of James Cameron's talents.

Kimberly Peirce, the Columbia film school graduate who became infatuated with the life of Brandon Teena, brings this true-story of one girl's search for happiness and the American Dream vividly to the screen.A beautifully composed title sequence shows us how Brandon Teena's friend helps her dress as a guy so she can go to a roller-skating rink and meet girls. It is clear from early on that Brandon is a self-hating lesbian, frustrated by the oppressive environment she lives in, and feels that her only solace is to don the clothing of boys in order to enjoy the women she can only dream of when dressed as a girl.Brandon clearly has a sexual identity disorder, which is all-so-real when you consider how vividly Peirce illustrates it's cause. There is one point in the film where Brandon's male friend, and future rapist\/killer, tells her about his experience in jail. He describes how in jail they would cut themselves with knives and how he was better because he could cut deeper. Essentially, these are men afraid of prison and use self-mutilation as a way of controlling their repressed anger. These are caged animals taking their aggression out on the world-intimidated by anything that is remotely different. The scene is a brilliant set-up to what most audience members know will happen-at least those who know the story.The story is told quite simply but it's psychological depth is endless. Brandon dresses as a boy and runs away to a small town and their falls in love with  Lana (Chloe Sevigny). Lana is genuinely in love with this pretty young boy and Brandon must deal with the fact that eventually Lana will discover her secret. It is a secret that, when revealed, leads to the brutal downfall of Brandon.The film works because Peirce and her cinematographer compel us with images that brutally compliment the gripping screenplay. Throughout the film there are stunning cutaways of exterior shots shown in fast-motion. This is a world that Brandon can not keep up with. It is not until the end, when Brandon's world is no more, that mother nature returns to it's normal pace.Peirce so adeptly explores the psychology of `white trash' and their entrapment in middle America that you are amazed that this is a first time director. These are young people working at dead end jobs, living for beers and cigarettes, frustrated because of the limbo that their lives are in. Brandon is the stranger that they all connect with-feeding off her stories of supermodel sisters (a brilliant lie that she tells to explain away her feminine features) and the way `he' just came into their lives, giving them a momentary release from their tragically pathetic lives.And from all of this comes one of the greatest performances of the year. Hillary Swank, as Brandon Teena, stunningly captures the complexities of a young woman battling with the truth of her self and the lie of covering that self up. Her performance is one for the ages-one of those performances that Oscar so loves to ignore.Peirce directs her actors like a true master. They inhabit their space and spew their words in ways that make you feel as if you were watching this film in real time. And you would never think that a film like this would come across so horrific from the first frame to the last. If you know what happens to Brandon Teena one can not help but feel this overwhelming sense of fear and dread dripping from each frame. A truly admirable film.
