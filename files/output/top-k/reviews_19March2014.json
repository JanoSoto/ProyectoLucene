This was in the 80's when action stars and action flicks ruled the world. Most of them have now all been forgotten but not 'Predator' which has proved to stand the test of time by spawning a series of other productions from it's franchise.It had a pretty thin plot to start with, an actor who has a terrible accent and cannot act to save his skin in the lead role which all resulted in a lot of negative comments from movie critics. Even so with such uncertain frolics 'Predator' became an all time classic in its own right and this is how.This is the very first and probably last movie where the audience would get to see a terrified and scared Arnold Schwarzeneggar. Despite his marchioness and similar tough guy roles he plays in movies this is one movie where he was actually overpowered and as the audience you actually feel sorry for the guy. Arnold plays 'Dutch' a character ripped straight out of 'Commando' but the difference here now is the movie is not about 'Dutch' but rather about the creature. 'The Predator' itself is an iconic piece of work created by 'Stan Winston' and it deserved that academy award nomination. The monster with mandibles will give you the creeps, horrifying beyond imagination and its design is that of an impressive alien warrior straight out of the comic world. Not to forget the hi-tech weapons, agility and thermal vision, I mean need I say more. This movie spawned a lot of imitations that didn't come a step close to the original masterpiece.The other success of the movie is the fact that there is no horror at the beginning of the movie up until towards the end which was a style later adopted by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez in 'From Dusk Till Dawn'. It works well as it keeps you unsure of whether it is another 'Commando' movie or there is something here really worth watching. Truly the best of Arnold Schwarzenegger movies not because he outdid himself but simply because the movie was about the creature rather than the commandos. It goes straight to the point and there are no background story lines about the lives of commandos; like who they are and where they come from, which is really not necessary because the style of directing that doesn't leave any room for the equation. Moreover it was the haunting music of Alan Silvestri that shocked the critics and the audience, which comes at the perfect time and place and seems absolutely matched well to the 'Predator'. Who can forget the overwhelming presence of Kevin Peter Hall whom now other predator actors are failing to reach his bulk and fill in his shoes in later productions. More and more 'Predator' versions of nowadays seem a bit less bulky and extra skinny as compared to the original 'Predator'.'Predator' does so well with so little and the whole concept of a group of macho commandos in the jungle going against an unknown terror is just mind blowing.

And, naturally enough, Branagh stars as Henry V.This is an excellent version of Shakespeare's most famous history play. Branagh is an extremely talented Shakespearean actor, and, as a director, he was given the financing he needed to make a film with superb production values. (The film won an Oscar for best costume design.)Branagh's Henry V--unlike Sir Laurence Olivier's--is less about patriotism and more about leadership. Every monarchy fares better with a capable king, and Shakespeare wanted us to know that Henry V, after a misspent youth, had become a capable king. Henry's leadership is demonstrated by his prowess in the war against France. The play is about the great English victory at Agincourt. However, unlike Olivier's Agincourt, this battle is portrayed as a bloody, muddy mess. Surely, this is the more historically accurate version. The charming scene when Henry woos Princess Katherine de Valois (his wife Emma Thompson) comes off pretty well. Thompson was 30 at the time, so she didn't try to play the role as a blushing ingenue. She's a real princess, who realizes that she will have to marry Henry in any event, but who maintains her dignity by making him work for her consent.Olivier dropped any scenes in which Henry might appear cruel, but Branagh keeps them in. Naturally, the hanging of Bardolph isn't shown onstage in a theater. But Branagh the movie director shows it to us in graphic detail. Henry agonizes as he watches the execution, but he lets it go forward.Branagh is astute enough to know that audiences love to see stars in cameo roles. We get Derek Jacobi as Chorus, Ian Holm as Captain Fluellen, Christian Bale as Robin, Judi Dench as Mistress Quickly, and Paul Scofield as King Charles VI of France. Obviously, they can all master these roles without even trying, and they do.We saw this movie on a classroom-sized large screen. It would work better in a theater. Something will be lost if you see it on DVD. However, if you love a great story, great acting, and great directing, you owe it to yourself to see this film. You won't be disappointed.

The mining vessel Nostromo is on its return voyage, but the crew is unexpectedly awaken from its hyper sleep because the ship has received an intelligent signal. The crew wakes up happy, thinking they are almost home. Everything goes down hill when they realize what's going on and that they have to explore some inhospitable planet. A portion of the crew goes off and Kane (John Hurt) is attacked by some parasite. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) tries to keep the crew from getting back in, fearing infection, but Ash (Ian Holm) lets the explorers in anyway. Eventually, an organism bursts out of Kane's stomach and runs amok on the ship. Kane is left dead, then Brett, then Dallas, then Ash, then finally Parker and Lambert. Ash, however, is murdered by the surviving crew after it was revealed he was an android and tried to hide an attempt to capture the alien instead of helping the crew with their original mission.This film is definitely the best scifi I've seen, perhaps ever. It has nice long talking sequences (after they wake up) and great seems of the ship (inside and out). Ripley Scott conceded in the commentary to have been heavily influenced by Stanley Kubrick's 2001&#x85; and this is obvious. However Alien maintains its uniqueness being much darker. The soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith also keeps it haunting and more a horror movie than the classical score of 2001. It's also less overt. I took at as a very good portrait of large corporate policy. A couple of the people are paid a lot less than the rest of the crew (one of them is black) and they want to make more money but aren't really taken seriously. It also has the secret android which is good because many times corporations don't keep their policies open. I always find it important that scifi movies have some type of statement. After all, we cannot talk about the future without keeping in mind what is going on in the present. To sum it up, it is slow paced and powerful. It is haunting and inspiring (the survival of the cat). It's a high recommend to everyone.

A couple of the people are paid a lot less than the rest of the crew (one of them is black) and they want to make more money but aren't really taken seriously. It also has the secret android which is good because many times corporations don't keep their policies open. I always find it important that scifi movies have some type of statement.

It is haunting and inspiring (the survival of the cat). It's a high recommend to everyone.

The mining vessel Nostromo is on its return voyage, but the crew is unexpectedly awaken from its hyper sleep because the ship has received an intelligent signal. The crew wakes up happy, thinking they are almost home. Everything goes down hill when they realize what's going on and that they have to explore some inhospitable planet. A portion of the crew goes off and Kane (John Hurt) is attacked by some parasite. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) tries to keep the crew from getting back in, fearing infection, but Ash (Ian Holm) lets the explorers in anyway. Eventually, an organism bursts out of Kane's stomach and runs amok on the ship. Kane is left dead, then Brett, then Dallas, then Ash, then finally Parker and Lambert. Ash, however, is murdered by the surviving crew after it was revealed he was an android and tried to hide an attempt to capture the alien instead of helping the crew with their original mission.This film is definitely the best scifi I've seen, perhaps ever.

There are too many variables involved. But I'll do a wee bit of comparing anyway. Looking at this version of The Big Sleep on its own merits, it is fairly good, and perhaps even somewhat above average for movies in the detective genre. Where it compares well with its class, Mitchum is the reason. Mitchum is laid back without losing the edge that makes a movie sparkle.Robert Mitchum is simply a huge treat, whether narrating or acting, which for him quite often is reacting. From the opening lines of sarcasm and self-deprecation to the final lines of the fate that awaits all human beings, the noir ambiance hangs over the story, but especially when Mitchum's there and speaks. He alone creates that atmosphere. When John Mills, James Donald, Richard Todd and Oliver Reed appear, the noir vanishes. Much the same for Sarah Miles. This is a function not of them personally or as actors, but of the scripting of their characters. Their lines and conflicts come across too often as mundane.Harry Andrews as the butler of the very rich and frail Jimmy Stewart carries the sarcasm forward. Edward Fox scores as a man looking for an angle to blackmail. Candy Clark makes an impression as the dippy but not to be refused or scorned younger daughter of Stewart, who is into drugs and likes posing nude. Sarah Miles plays the older sister as wild, spoiled, domineering but not too bright. She cannot figure out Mitchum for one thing and she's tied herself up with Oliver Reed. Richard Boone is an excellent Lash Canino, in a far different way than was Bob Steele. Colin Blakely does not, however, bring out the pathos as did Elisha Cook, Jr. Joan Collins is a notable bitchy associate of Fox in the dirty book business. Maybe she should have been cast as the elder daughter of Stewart.The movie follows the story faithfully. For first-timers who do not know the story, the movie doesn't spoon feed too much. You are more or less seeing things through Mitchum's (Marlowe's) eyes. The opening shots are from Marlowe's point of view driving to see Strernwood. Some scenes are handled perfuntorily, others with some subtlety and good tension. Inside the richly-appointed book store is a good scene, as Joan Collins taps her enameled fingernails on the table and Mitchum, wearing glasses, sits across the room inspecting her. Her clothing color matches her nails. The night scenes near Geiger's house and its interiors come across with an air of mystery. Generally, the daytime scenes lack a sense of atmosphere while the night scenes are lit much better to achieve that. The scenes between Reed and Mitchum are not bad, but don't generate the spark they should. The actors are doing what they can with dialog that seems off center.For the first time, I watched this in a widescreen version (1.851). This added some to the experience. I think that this movie needed more boldness and creativity from its director, more nice touches, to have realized its potential. He needed to bring more out of his cast than he did and to complement that with better images. I think Michael Winner did better work in his earlier movies in the seventies.This is a movie I like but not one that I'd rate as much more than average.

As all but an expert on this topic, I'm in no position to assess whether the film is realistic and respectful to actual patients, but bringing people closer to the minds of schizophrenics and other mentally ill by making a star-studded Hollywood film out of their perspective is rating praise already.Ron Howard realized a great mixture of drama, romance, action, and humour with A Beautiful Mind, something many directors attempt to do nowadays, clearly resulting from the award-winning prospect it brings along, but only very few succeed in. Story-wise, the film is immensely entertaining, touching, and just as beautiful as its title suggests. Another major merit of the four-time Oscar winner is its lead actor Russell Crowe, going from heroic action star in Gladiator to socially awkward genius in just two years. He performs extraordinarily in both productions, but his portrayal of the real-life figure John Nash is a far greater achievement. His on-screen partners do wonderful work as well, even if some of the characters do conform to stereotypes.The film's cinematography is of no lesser quality, capturing the past times the story is set in in gorgeous colours and imaginative shots, such as Paul Bettany defenestrating a desk out in Princeton's snowed campus or the seasons passing outside while John is working on the theory of his lifetime. All of that is accompanied by a James Horner score as melodic and fitting as hardly any other in film history and one that is also a pleasure to listen to on its own.Thus, A Beautiful Mind is a more than deserving Best Picture winner at the Oscars and a film worth watching more than once.

I understand that director Robert Altman blamed the studio for severe post-production editing. Sorry, but the problems this film has are far deeper than post-production editing. In fact, I have an idea the editing helped.However, this is not a bad film. This is a film you want to watch if you like suspense. It has it, and it is the one thing in the film that really works pretty well. Even there, however, there are a couple of flaws. Within the first 15 minutes I concluded that Robert Downey's character -- a private eye -- would end up dead before the film was over; very predictable. Within the first half hour it was pretty clear that Tom Berenger's character had some further use in the film -- perhaps as the bad guy -- when his early scenes gave him almost no screen time...something an actor who was doing pretty good at that time in his career wouldn't accept; so, clearly, his character was being saved for the climax.Another plus here is the setting -- Savannah, Georgia. It's different, even a bit exotic, although I'm not sure we needed to add in a hurricane.In terms of the acting, very uneven. I've always thought Kenneth Branagh was a very good actor; here he gets by. Embeth Davidtz is quite good as the daughter who is knee-deep in conspiracy; probably the best performance in the film. Robert Downey, Jr. was sleepwalking through this film; or perhaps staggering through it, since this was made during that low point in his personal life. I've always liked Downey, but here he's very disappointing, though it could have been a very good role for him. Tom Berenger has too little screen time; more of him would have been preferable, although plot-wise it works. Daryl Hannah...well, suffice it to say that this film highlights her limitations as an actress. If you're a Robert Duvall fan, here's a role (as a nut) he could have really sunk his teeth into...but he also seems to sleepwalk through the part.The suspense factor here makes me give this a 7, but it's very borderline. Not a bad film, but a definite disappointment. Watchable once. John Grishom...what have they done to you?

Ripley has been rescued, along with Jones, but it's been almost 6 decades and her only surviving daughter is dead. What's worse, the company professes to not believing her, and she is stripped of her license. She's forced to take a crap job. Some time later, the planet that contains the aliens has been colonized, but one of the colonists awakens the hive, and contact is severed. Ripley is recruited to join a group of marines on a rescue mission. They arrive but find only 1 of the 158 inhabitants alive and are soon assaulted by the aliens. Carter Burke (Paul Reiser), a member of the company, is all the while trying to bring back one of the aliens. One by one the rescue party is killed. Eventually only Ripley, the surviving girl Newt, and a badly hurt Bishop are able to make it to safety. The aliens appear to have been defeated, for now.This movie has all the heavy hitting action that one would expect from a James Cameron flick. It stays true to the original in terms of plot, but it really is still a different movie. The first one was quiet where this is loud. There is a lot of gunshots and fighting and death. I liked seeing the devastation of the colony and, especially, the filth that Newt had to survive in. I liked that it created a separate world, albeit short lived, on the colony. We see the workers running around doing this and that.Paul Reiser did a really good job as the sleazy representative (or whatever his job title was). He keeps this slight smirk on his face that makes you not trust him, although you aren't really given a reason until towards the end. It's also great that a movie can have such good special effects 20 years after its debut (and before CGI). This movie is an achievement, although it works more like an action movie than a thriller. And I will say that I prefer the latter.It's a big recommend.

Odd choice, but it did create certain creepiness. It affects the household in the usual manner, especially possessing the family and turning them against each other while feeding on the fear and anger it creates. Nothing really surprises here, as again it's a mixture of the previous films with its own slant. However it moves by fast enough, entertains with its twisted shocks, an eerie score effortlessly fits in and the characters for most part are fairly agreeable. Some of the make-up FX (that of our demonic guests) and special effects are well done, especially when the dollhouse becomes the gateway to hell. It gets crazy, but fairly entertaining. The cast give dependable turns with the likes of Robin Thomas, Rachel Duncan and Starr Andreeff. Neat, cosy horror that amuses despite its lack of new tricks.
