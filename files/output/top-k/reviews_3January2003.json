It is not that they didn't do anything with them, it is just that some were quite duds.  They could have done something smarter or a lot more hilarious with pop culture references and Disney characters, but they did not.The concept of inner beauty did not quite gist either, since the portrayl of King Farquaad as a short person signifies somehow his stature is what is lacking and he somehow has to compensate for it.The film tries to attract young audience by gross humor instead of wholesome characters like the do in Disney animations.  In doing so, it probably took a shortcut in the developing of the story.  The building up of the relationship between Shrek and the princess involves her showing she is not a prissy by burping in front of him.To sum it up, it is a funny movie with some heartwarming central story.

It tries to be a satire, but it is interrupted too frequently by slapsticks.  Then it tries to be sentimental or inspirational, only to be followed more gags and bad jokes.  Ultimately, it is not funny enough in either way for it to succeed.Some things that was funny were portrayals of odd characters and the satires nature of the film.  The discussion between Shaun Brunder's (Colin Hanks) and the writer and the revelation of his short story is quite touching.Shaun's brother Lance (Jack Black), is just plain annoying.  It seems as if his whole purpose in this movie is to unintentionally sabotage anything anyone is trying to do.  I presume Shaun having lived with his brother his whole life, would know better than be in proximity of him in which there will be a remote chance of him screwing things up.Much of the story defies logic, like the concept of giving up the chance to give up study under a famous writer and going to the equivalent of 13th grade just to be with some high school sweetheart, the family who doesn't even know what college is.  I mean these are not Beverly Hillbillies, and he is only going to college a few hours away, not permanantly relocation to another country.  Also, the sudden turnaround of a surfer bum who somehow in a year has a cumulative GPA of 3.5 and SAT score of 1530 baffles me.  Even if it is just the character tha has changed, it wasn't portrayed as a like scenario.Much of the other charicatures seems also obviously set up purely for gags, like the mom who gets drunk right before and during the visit by a school board member.  I thought schools likes people who overcame disadvantaged childhood like Shaun, but they make it look like Stanford only wants children of foreign leaders.Other scenarios are set up so clumsily that you knew it was coming a mile away, like the urine sample on the table, the handling over of the bottle of asprin found in Lance's jacket (even when Lance handed his sweater to Shaun's girlfriend, its like, a drug mixup is coming up.)To sum it up, it is probably better than the rest of the teen movies, but it is still ho-hum for the rest of the crowd.

The cast did look pretty good, with Al Pacino as the main actor. I now regret I didn't do something else in these over 160 minutes. I have sincerely never seen a movie that was so senseless, and so used as this one. None of the characters really do have some substance, and all the sudden changes in the plot are irrational. So are most of the characters.SPOILERS   First of all, I think Cameron Diaz was totally out of place with this part. She just didn't fit in the picture, and I kind of felt a strange disgust each time I saw her on my TV screen during the movie. I mean, it's totally out of place to put a woman in general in the lead of such a horrible, utterly violent sport, which I must say, disgusts me. I just can't see what all this violence is about...but anyway, let's get back to the movie.    Then there is the character of Jamie Fox, the new star Beamen. We see three faces of him...at first, a nice guy...then a guy whose got lost in his sudden fame...and then back to the nice guy. These changes are totally unfounded, and I really see no reason why they happen. It's just a way to waste some film.   Al Pacino is the so called old-fashioned coach. He is the guy who wants the sport to be pure. He cares about tradition. He just isn't in the right place...in that world corrupted by the taste of money. His character is also badly constructed. One time we hear that he ain't good for anything, then he's great again...it makes no sense!   I really didn't make much out at the beginning out of the scenes of the games...it was all so confusing, and as I have little knowledge of this sport, I thought it was all, again, without any real meaning.The wonderful stories, about tradition and stuff are all old...nothing new in them.    Then there was the end...I mean, what was that about? So stupid, and not needed. Just as the movie got a little more decent...   I cam to the thought that this movie wanted to show how life in this sport is, for the guys who play it...but who is the fault for all the drugs, all the women and all the violence? What can you even expect from people who think only about money, and who play such a violent sport! I mean, the scene with the eye was just mad!    All this film did was make me see how violent this sport really is, and I have to think that some people are just not thinking right if they like this...how can you enjoy such a grotesque game? I'll never come to understand some things.      The good parts were very few...I can't even recall any. Oh, one more thing. Why, just why, did it have to be so long? Why show so many games? Again, without any real objective. If you really want to see a movie about this sport, then I recommend Remember the Titans. Yes, I know it's not the same thing, but at least it's something in that direction.   I consider I am very generous as I mark this one with a 5. All for Pacino...I'm sorry he even got involved in this junk.

So are most of the characters.SPOILERS   First of all, I think Cameron Diaz was totally out of place with this part. She just didn't fit in the picture, and I kind of felt a strange disgust each time I saw her on my TV screen during the movie. I mean, it's totally out of place to put a woman in general in the lead of such a horrible, utterly violent sport, which I must say, disgusts me. I just can't see what all this violence is about...but anyway, let's get back to the movie.    Then there is the character of Jamie Fox, the new star Beamen. We see three faces of him...at first, a nice guy...then a guy whose got lost in his sudden fame...and then back to the nice guy. These changes are totally unfounded, and I really see no reason why they happen. It's just a way to waste some film.   Al Pacino is the so called old-fashioned coach. He is the guy who wants the sport to be pure. He cares about tradition. He just isn't in the right place...in that world corrupted by the taste of money. His character is also badly constructed. One time we hear that he ain't good for anything, then he's great again...it makes no sense!   I really didn't make much out at the beginning out of the scenes of the games...it was all so confusing, and as I have little knowledge of this sport, I thought it was all, again, without any real meaning.The wonderful stories, about tradition and stuff are all old...nothing new in them.    Then there was the end...I mean, what was that about? So stupid, and not needed. Just as the movie got a little more decent...   I cam to the thought that this movie wanted to show how life in this sport is, for the guys who play it...but who is the fault for all the drugs, all the women and all the violence? What can you even expect from people who think only about money, and who play such a violent sport! I mean, the scene with the eye was just mad!    All this film did was make me see how violent this sport really is, and I have to think that some people are just not thinking right if they like this...how can you enjoy such a grotesque game? I'll never come to understand some things.      The good parts were very few...I can't even recall any. Oh, one more thing. Why, just why, did it have to be so long? Why show so many games? Again, without any real objective. If you really want to see a movie about this sport, then I recommend Remember the Titans. Yes, I know it's not the same thing, but at least it's something in that direction.   I consider I am very generous as I mark this one with a 5. All for Pacino...I'm sorry he even got involved in this junk.

While shopping in the stores, I bought a book about Disney animation. Included in it was some rough concept art for THE BLACK CAULDRON. I remember hoping that the movie would be released, soon. Being 14 at the time, I thought of Disney movies as pretty much lame kiddie movies, but this looked pretty cool.Fast forward a decade, to me as a graduating senior from college. I remember hearing that the movie was in theaters, then POOF!, gone. Never to be heard of again, or so we thought.In the early 1990's a wife of a friend of mine was a manager at a local Disney Store, and I asked her when BLACK CAULDRON might be available on VHS. She rolled her eyes up in her head, and said, 'Pretty much, never!'. Apparently a lot of folks asked that same question, and she told me that BC, is the movie that Disney chooses to forget. Then, a few years later, we all went to one of the theme parks at Disney and were looking in a store that sold movie posters for their `great' movies. In the huge stack of `Little Mermaid' and `Aladdin' posters was one for BLACK CAULDRON. My friend's wife seemed amazed at finding it, and she said that `Disney must be considering re-releasing the movie if this poster is here'. And surprise, in 1998, we found it on the shelves of our local video store.My wife and I decided to preview it before we let our young daughters see it. And man, am I glad we did. Truly NOT a movie for the under 7 or so set. Dark, deep, and troubled, is the best way to describe BC. I do like more `mature' animation, but this seemed a mish mash of past Disney style, fantasy art, and a move in a new direction of animation.The other disappointing part of the 1998 release was, that it's in Full Screen format. What a let down as the movie is one of only two, I believe, 70 MM format animated Disney movies. SLEEPING BEAUTY, being the other, and that WAS available in VHS wide screen format. The print that was used to make the tape, also appeared to be very poor, and it appeared to have been edited, as one or two scene transitions didn't seem smooth.I may rent the DVD, and give it another try, but as previous posters have stated, it's not for everyone.

Maybe because I watched it with friends, but recently I got it on DVD. Wow. Normally I don't like action films; Terminator and its sequel barely registered. But what makes the Matrix great is the story and the dialogue. I've seen that many people have pointed out that Dark City and Blade Runner were superior to the Matrix. Yes, Blade Runner has a better plot and deeper psychological value, but I was THAT close from falling asleep during it and it didn't contain one decent action sequence (to my memory). Plus I've never heard of Dark City till now.One big problem with all the Matrix's story is that it doesn't know where to go with the sybolism floating around. All the Biblical references which have already been mentioned 10,000 times, Alice in Wonderland, Neo as a new Jesus Christ...and? What's the point? Don't get me wrong, I love the Matrix for what it is, a brilliant action movie, but the thousands of people who claim that the Matrix is all about 'the new Messiah' makes me smile, somewhat sheepishly.Nevertheless, one has to admit the Matrix's plot is very original. The effects are of course astounding, even three years on, despite the numerous spoofs of them. The characters are definitely flat... but leagues ahead of any other action movie in existence. Agent Smith was in fact my favourite character, what with him displaying the most human qualities; it was a shame about the ending (though rumours abound that he will return in the sequels).The thing about the Matrix is that it is too contemporary to be taken seriously. I mean, twenty years from now (Matrix fanatics take note), no-one is going to care about it. They'll probably laugh, just like I did at Hal, the talking computer from 2001. I don't think it's a masterpiece of film-making, but give it its due, it's a good action film with a solid script.

Having only just seen him in 'Fight Club' it was unreal to see him stray from a funny, wimpy part to one such as this. I don't know if he won any awards for this film, but if he didn't, then I would just have to say that those voters really are delusional if they don't recognise a fantastic actor when they see one.

Well, he made a damn good film that's for sure. World famous super spy Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is living a happy life in 2002. He has defeated Dr. Evil (Mike Myers again), put him and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) behind bars and he is to be knighted. Things go wrong when his father, Nigel Powers (Michael Caine)is absent at the knighting ceremony and kidnapped by Goldmember (Mike Myers' newest role, a freaky Dutch disco dancer in 1975. Austin travels back to save his father and teams up with the sexy Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles). Between all this, there are a pair of Japanese twin sisters called Fook Mi and Fook Yu, a dance number which helps Dr. Evil escape, a crazy Sumo scene involving Fat Bastard (Mike Myers yet again) and a submarine in the shape of Dr. Evil himself. 'Goldmember' is the best film in the Austin Powers series and one of the best comedies of 2002 full stop. Everything from Goldmember trying to explain who Austin's Fahza is to Foxxy communicating to Austin through a hilarious Nathan Lane, every joke is milked out of the Austin Powers phenomenon and it's worth every penny. This film had me in tears with laughters. I mean, the smallest things like the way Dr. Evil and Frau (Mindy Sterling) say 'ya!' to each other or the fact that Scott (Seth Green) is so evil he's losing his hair had me rolling about the floor in laughter. Few comedies reach the near perfect mark but 'Goldmember' is one of them. To be honest, I wouldn't mind seeing an 'Austin Powers 4' right now considering how good this is. In the previous film, Mini-Me's scenes felt somewhat unsettling but here he is original and amusing. It's pure genius this film and to try to sum that up would be hard. The only part that really lets you down is Britney Spears' cameo. They were obviously just casting her to get a bigger audience. At least she had a funny joke during the end credits. Jay Roach returns behind the camera in what is his funniest film yet, and that's counting 'Meet the Parents'. Mike Myers and Michael McCullers once again write the screenplay and it's a real zinger. With cameos from everyone to Tom Cruise to John Travolta, it's sure to entertain!

It is utterly horrible and a waste of anyone's money.The reason, though, that I gave this movie a 4 is because, for some reason, whenever it is on T.V, it is one of the best movies ever. If it weren't so bad it could be considered a cult classic.First off, the acting is horrible. Jeremy Irons, a terrific actor, is at his worst. He probably didn't give it his all as he could've thought that it would be a campy hoot to be in this flick. Thora Birch (yes, FRESH off of American Beauty) makes it seem like this is her first movie. Bruce Payne is constantly over-acting and never tones it down; it really might've helped the movie. Justin Whalin delivers the worst NOOOO! ever and really can't show emotions very well. Just think of him as the poor-man's Keanu Reeves. The non-human characters must think there cooler than us, and therefore think that they don't have to act, at all. Zoe McLellan is... OK, she actually fits the part. The only good acting in this movie is by Richard O'Brien (where if you streched his performance as long as others, it would probably be bad). He's only on screen for 5 minutes, but he can do no wrong. The real problem with the acting  is Marlon Wayans. If you've ever played D&D you would know that no Rogue (the class closest to thief) would be that bumbling and stupid, as any Rogue that was would die really fast. If you haven't played D&D, you would know that know human as stupid as him would survive for very long. He really drags the movie down as much as he can as some pretty bad comedic sidekick.The Script is horrible and includes so many bad things. The dialouge is some of the worst you've ever heard. The plot is explained off screen and the characters suddenly know what to do. The plot is pretty bad considering a lot of the story ideas one could find on-line.The sets are pretty lame and look like a high school stage crew put them together.

This has to have been one of the funniest movies that I've ever seen! Now, that isn't saying that Tom Green is a genius; in fact, it is the sheer stupidity and audacity of this film that allows it to click for me. I don't usually watch comedies to think deeply about the problems of the human existence (unless, of course, it's an exceptionally well-crafted mix of drama and comedy, such as the Michael Moore documentaries or Kubirck's Dr. Strangelove). My maxim is this if it makes me laugh, it's good enough for me. The movie doesn't even require a decent plot or even decent actors. It helps to be weird, sick, twisted, and, nonsensical. Sheer anarchy reigns in Freddy. The movie essentially takes the loser seeking to fulfil his dreams plot and twists and contorts those cliches to grotesque levels that the lame Saturday Night Live movies could never in their wildest dreams hope to accomplish. Even Amelia Bedelia-type puns are toyed with. For example, when the cartoon producer advises Green to get inside his animals, who would have expected that Green would not only get inside of a deer skin, but would have the audacity to take out a bowie knife and skin a stinking hunk of roadkill, with its guts making a sqeauling noise as they spill onto the road, all to the tune of some corny Coca-Cola ad? Yes, this is not funny, you all may say, it's sick! but I think its Greens willingness to cause the audience to wretch that's funny, rather than the sick pun itself. The beyond-belief stupidity also adds to the movie. That Gord's girlfriend's favorite hobbies include constructing rocket powered wheelchairs and flipping coffee creamers is too weird not to at least be snickered at. I must say, the romance between Gord and his girlfriend clicks they're both equally crass, moronic, and surreal. Hell, it's far more believable than the wooden romance between Darth Vader and his geisha girlfriend in that new Star Wars movie. The strange, unbelievable plot turn at the end is also so poorly-conceived, that it's funny. I'm still baffled that all throughout the movie idiocy reigned supreme, yet Green makes an obscure geography reference to the Thar Desert, which is on the India-Pakistan border. This geography reference would probably be rather obscure to most people. Hey, there's a reason to recommend Freddy learn South Asian geography! I suppose part of the reason people despised Freddy was the fact that Gord, the protagonist, was a selfish, despiciable personage, always willing to do harm to his family and friends to get what he wanted. In many of the other so-called potty humor films, the characters get into gross situations, but they always mean well and have kind hearts; there's none of that with Gord. He only cares for himself, and is willing to destroy the good name of his father and straight-laced brother to get what he most desires. Gordon Brody is definitely the devil-child that Chris Farley and Adam Sandler are not in their movies. Still, I think that Green's evil anti-hero is a breathe of fresh air to the good-guy personas we often see in these movies. This movie is no classic, but it may someday achieve some sort of cult status amongst Green fanatics and people who like totally weird movies. Freddy may have lost the battle with the critics, but it may end up winning the war with a following of Green-iacs.

It's now 1999 and Austin discovers that his sexy wife is a fembot! After this, he then finds out that Dr. Evil (Mike Myers again) has returned to Earth and has built a time machine and even has a clone. One Difference The clone is one eight his size. Dr. Evil names him Mini-Me (Verne Troyer). With the help of Number 2 (Robert Wagner, back from the dead after his horrible burning in the first film), Dr. Evil and Mini-Me travel back in time to 1969 where they steal Austin's mojo with the help of Fat Bastard (Mike Myers' newest role), a huge disgruntled Scottish guard who loves to eat babies. Powerless without his mojo, Austin travels back in time to 1969 to get it back from Dr. Evil and make him the sexy beast he once was. The only problem is that he falls desperately in love with beautiful Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) but because of the lack of mojo, he is not able to do anything with her. It's now essential that Austin retrieves his mojo stuck in the hands of the 1969 Dr. Evil gang which includes a young Number 2 (Rob Lowe, in a great performance). This film would be great if it wasn't for the amount of copying from the first films. The infamous 'Shh!' scene from the first one is now the 'Zip it!' scene. One of the biggest talks when this film was released was about how many jokes were taken from the first film. This is not really a bad thing but we were expecting something really original (Watch 2002's Goldmember to see what it should have been) sadly this film is more or less a remake. Still, it's good for some laughs The chess scene, Mini-Me's introduction, any scene with Mindy Sterling as Frau and, of course, the ever so sexy Heather Graham as karate chopping 1969 agent Felicity Shagwell. Shagwell by name Shag-very-Well by reputation. A lot of the crew from the first film has returned here. Most prominent is Jay Roach who once again directs and does a fine job at it. While Mike Myers wrote solo in the first one, here he is equipped with a partner in the form of Michael McCullers who does a pretty good job. I might also point out that Myers now plays a third role here as... Fat Bastard! A hit or miss character, I found him hysterically funny and was glad he returned in 'Goldmember'! Verne Troyer does a good job as Mini-Me but there's just something about him that isn't right. Luckily, that is gone in the next film. Well, 'The Spy Who Shagged Me' is certainly a funny film but if you've seen the first film then you've seen all these jokes. Skip it and go straight to 'Goldmember'. ","genre":null},{"date":"3 January 2003","score":"","review":"  We last saw sexy spy Austin Powers (Mike Myers) with his beautiful wife Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley) two years ago when the original ended. It's now 1999 and Austin discovers that his sexy wife is a fembot! After this, he then finds out that Dr. Evil (Mike Myers again) has returned to Earth and has built a time machine and even has a clone. One Difference The clone is one eight his size. Dr. Evil names him Mini-Me (Verne Troyer). With the help of Number 2 (Robert Wagner, back from the dead after his horrible burning in the first film), Dr. Evil and Mini-Me travel back in time to 1969 where they steal Austin's mojo with the help of Fat Bastard (Mike Myers' newest role), a huge disgruntled Scottish guard who loves to eat babies. Powerless without his mojo, Austin travels back in time to 1969 to get it back from Dr. Evil and make him the sexy beast he once was. The only problem is that he falls desperately in love with beautiful Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) but because of the lack of mojo, he is not able to do anything with her. It's now essential that Austin retrieves his mojo stuck in the hands of the 1969 Dr. Evil gang which includes a young Number 2 (Rob Lowe, in a great performance). This film would be great if it wasn't for the amount of copying from the first films. The infamous 'Shh!' scene from the first one is now the 'Zip it!' scene. One of the biggest talks when this film was released was about how many jokes were taken from the first film. This is not really a bad thing but we were expecting something really original (Watch 2002's Goldmember to see what it should have been) sadly this film is more or less a remake. Still, it's good for some laughs The chess scene, Mini-Me's introduction, any scene with Mindy Sterling as Frau and, of course, the ever so sexy Heather Graham as karate chopping 1969 agent Felicity Shagwell. Shagwell by name Shag-very-Well by reputation. A lot of the crew from the first film has returned here. Most prominent is Jay Roach who once again directs and does a fine job at it. While Mike Myers wrote solo in the first one, here he is equipped with a partner in the form of Michael McCullers who does a pretty good job. I might also point out that Myers now plays a third role here as... Fat Bastard! A hit or miss character, I found him hysterically funny and was glad he returned in 'Goldmember'!
