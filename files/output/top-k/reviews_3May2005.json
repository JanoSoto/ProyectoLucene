Looking at Jack's last 6 movies (Something's Gotta Give, Anger Management, About Schmidt, The Pledge, As Good as It Gets, Mars Attacks!)

The other two films were Fight Club and Bringing Out the Dead. All three films are about men trying to come to terms to what it means to be a man in America in this day and age. Fight Club finds meaning in deconstructing everything down to base needs, feeling through pain. Bringing Out the Dead gives meaning to its character through drug use, but is was in American Beauty that I found some sense of hope.In the film, Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) plays a middle aged, middle class suburbanite, with seemingly everything he could desire. He has a good, well paying job; a beautiful wife (Annette Bening); a large luxurious house; and a lovely daughter (Thora Birch). Yet, with all of this he is not happy. In fact, all of these things are not quite what they seem. His employer is facing cut backs, and he may soon lose his job. He marriage is in shambles, and his daughter openly hates him. Early, we see him masturbating in the shower, in narration; he states this is the highpoint of his day. All is not well in the house of Burnham.All of this changes when Lester meets Angela (Mena Suvari), his daughter, Jane's gorgeous, cheerleader friend. On first seeing Angela during a cheer routine, Lester feel a special, lustful connection. Later that night, Lester overhears Angela playfully tell Jane that if he would only work out, he would be sexy. His lust over this teenage vixen becomes the catalyst for the film and Lester's very life.Soon after Lester quits his job, in fact he bilks the company for a year's salary by threatening to disclose scandalous information that he has become privy to. He begins smoking pot, buys a hot rod.. He plays with remote control cars, takes a job at a fast food joint, and of course does start working out. In every way he reverts back to his teenage years. Even the soundtrack begins blaring out classic rock tunes from the 1970's. Finally after years, decades even, of feeling low, miserable, not alive, he feels great.This reversion back to his glory days is only the beginning. It is a reversion back to the days when he had fun, when he felt alive. But he is not a man who will stop there. This is just a beginning point to a life long conversion of living a full life, as opposed to a life full of the right things, but that is ultimately empty. Or it would be if he was not shortly dead (this is not nearly the spoiler you might think it is, for Lester announced his death within the first minutes of the film.) Towards the end of the film we can see that Lester is already outgrowing his childish behavior. When he yells at his daughter, he immediately feels the sting of regret. When given the chance to indulge in his lusts, he backs away, understanding that it is not right. Just as the music changed to classic rock with the first change, here it has changed again, turning into the same classic rock being covered by newer, contemporary artists.Many will probably say that using the lust for a teen, and illicit drug us as a catalyst for change, is not a change for the better. I can already hear my mother scolding me for having seen the movie, much less reviewed it from 2,000 miles away in Oklahoma. Yet, here it works, and works well. I don't believe the film is saying that these things should be the means to a change, these things only served as means for this character to break free from the rut that had become his life. There is a telling scene where Lester and his wife are overcome with sexual desire. As he dips his wife to kiss her, she stops the embrace because he is near to spilling his glass of wine on an expensive couch. An argument ensues with Lester proclaiming that it's just a couch, while his wife is horrified at the thought of ruining said couch. There lies one of the central themes of the film. That these characters are so wrapped up in the material that they lose sight of the better pleasure of life, including love making.It is not a perfect film. The Burnham's neighbor, Col. Fritts (Chris Cooper) seems a caricatured archetype. His plays a hateful, homophobe who really carries deep rooted homosexual tendencies is too outlandish to be considered real. Though it must be said the part is played marvelously by Chris Cooper. Jane's speech about being a freak too, may move the young kids who consider themselves the nonconformist, shy-type, but it is too after-school special for my tastes.I've left out some of the best scenes and an important character, Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley). He plays the drug dealing son of Col. Fritts, who likes to record everything on his video camera. There is a moving scene in which he and Jane watch an old tape of his of a plastic bag floating through the air. It is a moving, poetic scene that conjures up thought of the futility of life and its very beauty. It is that type of movie. It creates beautiful, moving, simple scenes that bring a sense of hope to life, while at the same time, showing the ultimate horror of living it.

You've obviously mistaken me for someone with potential, she barely manages to squeak to the wedding photographer, in one of the multitudinous lines of on-the-nose dialogue in this self-conscious, overwrought clunker.Somehow this bright, beautiful 20-year-old has managed to get through her entire life, including four years of college, without once meeting a person who has affirmed her intelligence and her creativity, even though she's smart enough to have been accepted into Harvard Law. Similar ironies occur in real life--the beauty who thinks she's ugly, the overachiever who thinks she's not doing enough--but at some point you lose interest in a character who's either got some serious personality disorder or whose creator (the writer) imagines that weird gestures and speeches can take the place of psychology.The beautiful, bright girl proves utterly vulnerable to the seducements of the wedding photographer an older, less-promising, often insolent, and lecherous man who says things to her like You can do it and You must learn to detest the bourgeoisie. Oh, I don't remember if he actually said *those* things, but his utterances are so much hogwash that only an impression of nonsense remains. Harper is introduced to . . . coffee houses! She listens to . . . jazz! Someone actually asks her about her ideas for the first ever time in her whole entire life! To go back to the biographical thing, how did this girl ever get the liberal arts education required to enter Harvard Law without someone at least once eliciting her opinion on something? And probably admiring it? Without ever having a lively conversation with intellectual and creative types? Without ever laughing? Without going through that whole fascinating-older-man thing about ten times? Without getting a glimpse outside the world she came from? Unlikely, weird scenes get slapped on, one after the other, without any progress in character or conflict. She throws herself on him hungrily. She moves in. He insults her, she runs away, she insults him and then comes back, they insult each other and reunite. When he's at his lowest, she goes into a frenzy of taking his picture, presumably off a roll of film with about 200 exposures on it. Then she gets him into focus and relents with a whimper.Ultimately, the photog turns out to be every bit as bad as he promises, and perhaps a little better since he's principled enough to send her away when it's at the point where the relationship can do nothing but drag her down. Fast-forward to so many years later and she's giving him the last and only thing she can her best wishes for a good death. The scene drags on and on, and ends with his dissolution into heavenly white light. Why? Whose story was this? He was the worst man I ever met. Or the best man I ever met. This ham-fisted summary, I suppose, is supposed to be a specimen of brilliant, tortured, complex ambiguity. To me, it's a failure to make a stand, an excuse for the writer to dump a truckload of contradictions into a character then sneak away without explaining any of it. And why end with him?

(One of my favorites in the film, actually.) Swingers is mainly about Mikey (Jon Favreau), a guy who's just come out of a six-year relationship and can't focus on anything else. His best friend Trent (Vince Vaughn) is only worried about trying to get into bed with any woman in sight.They head out to Vegas for a night and Trent makes some money and picks up a girl, but Mikey loses $300 and winds up thinking about his ex-girlfriend again.Essentially the film follows Mikey as he tries to learn to forget about his ex, and move on with his life, which is a very hard thing for him to do. This film is based around shame and embarrassment, and the most uncomfortable scene has to be the one in which Mikey desperately calls a woman he met at a bar and leaves about 12 messages on her answering machine. The punchline to the scene is hilarious and cruel.Swingers isn't quite as influential as it could have become. It inspired a cult following to go around saying things like, Money, baby! and it's definitely a guys' flick. (The male version of a chick flick, really.) It's not the huge breakthrough that Reservoir Dogs was but for its extremely low budget (I read $200,000) it certainly made a lot at the time of its release and solidified the careers of Favreau (who has gone on to direct and star in other productions), director Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity) and of course Vince Vaughn, whose career has gone somewhat down the drain since making this.Overall Swingers isn't flawless but it is a great insight into a jilted man's life and is more honest than about 90% of the films that are released through Hollywood nowadays. Its characters are very likable and three-dimensional and it entertained me throughout its short running time.

This film is based around shame and embarrassment, and the most uncomfortable scene has to be the one in which Mikey desperately calls a woman he met at a bar and leaves about 12 messages on her answering machine. The punchline to the scene is hilarious and cruel.Swingers isn't quite as influential as it could have become. It inspired a cult following to go around saying things like, Money, baby! and it's definitely a guys' flick. (The male version of a chick flick, really.) It's not the huge breakthrough that Reservoir Dogs was but for its extremely low budget (I read $200,000) it certainly made a lot at the time of its release and solidified the careers of Favreau (who has gone on to direct and star in other productions), director Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity) and of course Vince Vaughn, whose career has gone somewhat down the drain since making this.Overall Swingers isn't flawless but it is a great insight into a jilted man's life and is more honest than about 90% of the films that are released through Hollywood nowadays. Its characters are very likable and three-dimensional and it entertained me throughout its short running time.

There were a few difference with this viewing than in previous viewings. First I have actually been to the Devils Tower in Wyoming. Having actual seen this natural monument takes a little mystery out of it in the film. For years it seemed more like something out of the filmmakers imagination, something of the dreams of Hollywood, than something real. Something made of rocks and dirt. The mysterious glow that surrounded the rock in the film, and especially the first actual appearance in the film on television, has been dimmed a little. Likewise as Richard Dryfuss sculpts the mount in the beginning I wanted to shout at him to flatten the top.Secondly, I am now quite familiar with a number of Francois Truffaut's films. He plays the mysterious French scientist in the film, but is in reality, a gifted director and pioneer in the French New Wave. Being familiar with who the actor is, gave the character more depth and mystery. I wonder how Spielberg talked him into becoming an actor in his film. If he had any influence on the direction of the film. How much English he speaks.I have also, for the past few years, lived in Indiana. Much of the movie takes place in Muncie, Indiana and I found the same joy that I always find when a movie, book, or song takes place somewhere I know or have been to. As if it becomes more real simply because I know the places it occurs.To me, the film is less about aliens and more about a sense of wonderment. In a famous scene, a small boy stands in front of an open door which is ablaze in a fiery glow. You cannot see what is outside, but you have spend the previous minutes watching the boys mother become very frightened as the aliens attempt to enter the house. Yet the boy standing close to these unseen and unknown creatures stands unafraid, even curious. There are many beautiful shots of a night sky with billions of brilliant stars sparkling. Throughout the film Spielberg seems to be using space and aliens as a means to express wonder and amazement at the unknown. Richard Dreyfuss' character loses interest in his family and outside life except for the mystery of the things he saw in the night sky and the recurrent thought of the mysterious mountain. Several times as he builds the mountain out of clay, dirt, mashed potatoes he proclaims that it must mean something, but isn't sure of what. Even in the last scene when he boards the alien craft there is no final meaning given. It's as if Spielberg is saying that it is the search for meaning in the universe, it is in looking with wonder at the great mysteries of the world that we in fact find some purpose, some meaning.I was reading a review of Steven Spielberg as a director and one of the things it discussed was the directors tendency of not moving his camera. That he tends to allow action come to the camera's view instead of following the action with the camera. So as I watched this film I kept a keen eye out for camera movement. I did find this to be true, throughout the film the camera is still allowing the action to to move into view. That's not to say the camera was only in one place. In fact it often was placed in different parts of a room for a scene, but in any given shot there was little movement. No sweeping shots, no long tracking scenes. The biggest movement I saw was when Richard Dreyfuss and Melinda Dillon arrive at the Devils Tower. The camera then sweeps over the car and follows the characters up a hill to reveal, finally, the giant rock in a real shot. I'm not sure what to make of this, but found it interesting.As in many of Spielbergs films there is distress in a marriage. Richard Dreyfuss and Terri Garrs marriage literally falls apart as Dreyfuss becomes more and more obsessed with his visions. There is one scene in particular where Dreyfuss is locked in a shower crying and Terri Garr begins to scream at him and scream at the children to go to their rooms. Spielberg uses several close up shots of the children to show how this fighting disturbs them. Spielberg has been on record to say that his own parent's divorce disturbed him deeply. Many of his films either show the distress of an unhealthy marriage, or the products of divorced. Yet in this film the creator of this unhappiness in marriage, Richard Dreyfuss' character, is the hero, is whisked away in the wonderful alien ship. I view this not as a detraction from the film but as an artistic endeavor. Spielberg takes time out of his alien picture to show the hurt and pain Dreyfuss causes. Dreyfuss's character also shows remorse over his actions yet cannot turn away from his obsession. As he begins to tear down his scrapbooks of alien abductions he tears the pointy top of his clay Devil's Tower and becomes obsessed all over again. Though in reality I wold see such a person's actions in disgust and contempt in the context of the film I see it as a broader artistic action toward the overall goal of seeking deeper meaning and wonderment.

These films show how even soldiers fighting on the wrong side of a war are still human. They have families, loved ones, hopes and dreams.

Yet it is his relationship with the other three men that make up the central theme of the film.

For even at the end of the pictures no one has made new resolves with life, or changed their beliefs drastically.The action sequences, though well directed, still fall flat. Lee is unable to stir any real emotion out of the war's central motives or the intensity of its loss. It is when Lee focuses his attention of the relationships between his characters that this film succeeds. This is not surpassing when considering Lee's earlier films were small films focused on familial relationships. The bonds that grow between Roedel and Holt are moving. The love story between Sue Lee Shelley (a surprisingly good Jewel) and her suitors (to give names would be to give too much plot away) is also a treat. In Lee's next picture, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, he found a way to entwine both beautiful action sequences and smaller, meaningful exchanges of love.

Endlessly influential, often touted as the first action movie, and full of rich cinematography, brilliantly constructed set-pieces, humour, sorrow, and some timeless characters portrayed by excellent performances. The Seven Samurai is still seen today by fans and critics alike as one of the best films ever made, almost flawless in every department and still as appealing and relevant as it was 5 decades ago.The film begins by telling us that Japan over 400 years ago was a place of fighting and poverty, with Samurai and bandits wandering the countryside, some with honour, some stealing from the poor. We meet a group of 40 bandits who travel from village to village through the year ransacking and taking whatever they can find. In the past they have murdered farmers, raped their wives and daughters, and taken their livelihood. The decide to raid one village once it is time for the farmers to harvest. A few villagers over-hear this and tell everyone else so they can prepare. Some believe they should fight, some say they should plead with the bandits, others say they should just give in as always or they will be killed. Eventually their Patriarch Gisaku says they should go and hire some help, Samurai who will help them in exchange for food. This seems like an outrageous plan as Samurai are proud, but a small group of farmers led by Rikichi leave with some food to find such Samurai in the hope that their village will be saved, the alternative being worse. They struggle at first and we see how there is no pity for them, that most people are too busy with their own affairs. Just as they give up hope they witness Kambei, a Samurai performing a selfless deed. They follow him and ask for help. Joining Kambei is a young apprentice Samurai Katsushiro who also saw Kambei's deed, and following them is a fiery man who claims to be a samurai-Kikuchiyo. Kambei listens to them and eventually agrees, believing they will need a total of seven Samurai. He and Katsushiro make two, and they begin to look for and test others. Kambei's old friend Schichiroji who he believed was dead arrives making 3. A woodcutting, quirky Samurai called Heihachi joins as well as masterful swordsman Kyuzo making 5, and a man nicknamed strongman makes 6. They leave for the village, followed by Kikuchiyo who wants to be part of their group even though no-one believes he is a Samurai. He proves himself and makes 7 when the villagers do not come to welcome their rescuers. We see how the Samurai and farmers as two different kinds of people mix, and we see mistrust and fear. Many emotions come out adding a depth so rarely seen in action films, there is a love story between Katsushiro and Shino, many twists, prejudices and hidden truths. As the bandits approach, the farmers are trained and a plan is made, but there will be many casualties.As so many books have been written on this film alone I can only offer a summary. Each actor is excellent, with Mifune standing out. Shimura, Miyaguchi, Tsuchiya, and Kimura all give emotive performances and when a character dies or feels sorrow we genuinely grieve with or for them. There is so much going on and so many story lines that we are completely pulled into the lives of each character. Kurosawa's direction cannot be faulted, and although it is slow at times and the search for Samurai takes up much of the film, we are captivated throughout.

The Seven Samurai is still seen today by fans and critics alike as one of the best films ever made, almost flawless in every department and still as appealing and relevant as it was 5 decades ago.The film begins by telling us that Japan over 400 years ago was a place of fighting and poverty, with Samurai and bandits wandering the countryside, some with honour, some stealing from the poor. We meet a group of 40 bandits who travel from village to village through the year ransacking and taking whatever they can find. In the past they have murdered farmers, raped their wives and daughters, and taken their livelihood. The decide to raid one village once it is time for the farmers to harvest. A few villagers over-hear this and tell everyone else so they can prepare. Some believe they should fight, some say they should plead with the bandits, others say they should just give in as always or they will be killed. Eventually their Patriarch Gisaku says they should go and hire some help, Samurai who will help them in exchange for food. This seems like an outrageous plan as Samurai are proud, but a small group of farmers led by Rikichi leave with some food to find such Samurai in the hope that their village will be saved, the alternative being worse. They struggle at first and we see how there is no pity for them, that most people are too busy with their own affairs. Just as they give up hope they witness Kambei, a Samurai performing a selfless deed. They follow him and ask for help. Joining Kambei is a young apprentice Samurai Katsushiro who also saw Kambei's deed, and following them is a fiery man who claims to be a samurai-Kikuchiyo. Kambei listens to them and eventually agrees, believing they will need a total of seven Samurai. He and Katsushiro make two, and they begin to look for and test others. Kambei's old friend Schichiroji who he believed was dead arrives making 3. A woodcutting, quirky Samurai called Heihachi joins as well as masterful swordsman Kyuzo making 5, and a man nicknamed strongman makes 6. They leave for the village, followed by Kikuchiyo who wants to be part of their group even though no-one believes he is a Samurai. He proves himself and makes 7 when the villagers do not come to welcome their rescuers. We see how the Samurai and farmers as two different kinds of people mix, and we see mistrust and fear. Many emotions come out adding a depth so rarely seen in action films, there is a love story between Katsushiro and Shino, many twists, prejudices and hidden truths. As the bandits approach, the farmers are trained and a plan is made, but there will be many casualties.As so many books have been written on this film alone I can only offer a summary. Each actor is excellent, with Mifune standing out. Shimura, Miyaguchi, Tsuchiya, and Kimura all give emotive performances and when a character dies or feels sorrow we genuinely grieve with or for them. There is so much going on and so many story lines that we are completely pulled into the lives of each character. Kurosawa's direction cannot be faulted, and although it is slow at times and the search for Samurai takes up much of the film, we are captivated throughout. The action scenes, groundbreaking for their time still manage to create awe today simply because they are filmed so beautifully.

Jack Lemmon is superb as C.C. Baxter, the meek corporate worker who loans his apartment out to co-workers so they can spend alone time with their mistresses. In exchange for his services, Baxter is rewarded with high praise and before he knows it he is climbing the corporate ladder to success.The movie also stars Shirley MacLaine as the young woman Baxter falls in love with, and Fred MacMurray as his boss -- and the man who also has his sex-hungry eyes on MacLaine.In fact in one of cinema's greatest cases of irony, Baxter accepts tickets to a play from MacMurray in exchange for a night in his hotel room. Baxter invites his crush to go with him -- little does he know that she's the girl going to his own apartment that very night with MacMurray's character! The Apartment must have been very risqué and controversial when it was first released in 1960. This was an era of squeaky-clean, bright and colorful romantic comedies and this put a harsh twist on everything. The implications of sex are none-too-subtle and one of Baxter's neighbors tells him to keep the noise down at night -- followed by innuendo that nowadays would almost garner a film a PG-13 rating! Lemmon is really great in his role and displays perfect comic timing and Woody Allen-like nervous twitches and neurosis. Teamed with Billy Wilder it really is a great combination and the film itself is engaging and thoroughly entertaining.The Apartment -- along with other 1960s films such as The Hustler and Midnight Cowboy -- helped pave the way for future films, but its revolutionary status does not outweigh its lasting impact as a quality feature.

Go ahead and say it to   yourself, and I'll say that David Mamet's Glengarry, Glen Ross comes   close. Both feature snarling, biting dialog. Both have irredeemable   characters that will do anything for success. Mamet's characters are   mostly down-and-outers who are scrapping at each other to find some   sampling of their former successes. In Sweet Smell of Success there are   successful characters and losers, both of which need each other to   survive. It is a tale of a successful columnist and his need for a low   life press agent. It is a bitter, bleak story of power, success and the   desire to have more.    Burt Lancaster plays JJ Hunsecker, a powerful, successful columnist who   is at the top of his game. He gets what he wants, when he wants it with   no questions asked. He can make or break celebrities with a quick blurb   in his column. He dines with politicians and gets any girl he wants.   Tony Curtis is Sidney Falco, a low rent press agent who needs   Lancaster's blurbs for his clients to keep in business. Problem is,   Hunsecker has cut Falco out of his columns because Falco hasn't   delivered on a deal they made. Though Hunsecker can garner the love and   admiration of anyone he chooses, the one woman he cannot win over is   his own sister. As he repeatedly says throughout the film, she's all he   has. Problem is she is in love with a jazz singer, and they plan to   marry. Hunsecker can't bear the thought of losing his sister, so he   forces Falco to get rid of the boy by any means necessary.    The film is relentless. From beginning to end it never stops its   pounding. There is never a breath of kindness. The two characters with   some redeeming characteristics Hunsecker's sister, Susan (Susan   Harrison) and her boyfriend, Steve Dallas (Martin Milner), are so   overshadowed by the continual foul play by Hunsecker and Falco that   they come away with a foul stench.    Tony Curtis pulls a performance that reminded me of his turn as the   Boston Strangler. It is not difficult to see his Falco turning to   murder if it helped him succeed. Though as the strangler, he seems to   have found some remorse for his actions, where Falco is irredeemable to   the very end.    There is a seen in the middle of the picture where Falco pulls a trick   to convince a mid level performer to make Falco his press agent. At   this point Falco needs all the clients he can get. Later the performer   comes to Falco, ready to sign him as his agent. Falco, now feeling some   signs of success brushes the performer off without a second thought. It   is a telling scene of just how heartless and uncaring Falco has become.    Where has Burt Lancaster been all my life? Sadly enough, the only film   I can remember watching him in is the 1986 toss-off comedy Tough Guys.   His performance here is nothing short of astonishing. He is the king of   his castle, never stepping off his high throne, treating everyone as   servants. Even his shows of affection for Susan are grotesque and   menacing.    This is a story that his hard to watch. It is brutal, and menacing with   nary a redeeming aspect. But it is a film that must be watched.

These were movies that I saw on television or Beta\/VHS that were made before my time and not meant as children's stories. Some of them were genuine classics like To Kill a Mockingbird that instilled in me a sense that beauty and art can be found in a film. Others were like the Poseidon Adventure that while not particularly masterful films still showed me that there were many other films out there besides the family films being churned out at the local cineplex. These films eventually opened up to me the world of cinema.I first saw the Poseidon Adventure at Grandma and Papa's house. I had been dropped off by my mother for an afternoon while she went shopping or some other mundane task. After flipping channels awhile I came across this great sinking ship and fell mystified into a grand epic adventure. To this day I recall my mother coming home during the final 20 minutes or so and me making her stay because I just had to see the ending. She had seen the film, but praised it as a classic adventure and allowed me to see the end. Periodically I have caught bits and pieces of the movie again on cable and always pause to watch a scene or two. I bought it in a bargain bin a few months back and joyfully added it to my collection. Last night Amy and I decided to watch it.Watching it on DVD I realize this was the first time I have ever actually seen the very beginning of the movie. As a child I caught the picture 10-20 minutes into and all subsequent viewings have all been by catching it part way through on television. I am afraid the movie as a whole doesn't hold up all that well to my childhood memory. Oh, it's a big, grand adventure, but like the ship of the movie, it starts to sink under its own enormousness.It has a basic 70's disaster movie plot. Big ocean cruise liner is hit by enormous wave and is turned upside down, killing nearly everyone. A few survivors are followed as they make their way up (down?) the ship and try to escape. It is way over the top and it almost seems as if the director Ronald Neame told his actors to ham it up in every scene. Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine do their best howling at each other in every other scene.The script follows very basic rules. It rolls like something you would see in a basic screenwriter's class. You start with an establishing shot, follow it with a basic introduction of your main characters while making sure their essential character motivation is directly handed to the audience in their first few minutes of screen time. Then you set your plot into action. It's disaster is even set into action by an evil corporate leader. Leslie Nielson plays the good captain who is hounded by a goon sent from the ships corporate owner to ensure it ports for its final time on the right date. The corporate goon orders Nielson's captain to increase speed though Nielson argues this will surely cause the old ship to sink. The corporate goon, of course, wins and sets up the disaster. On a side note it is unintentionally funny to watch Nielson in a serious role when everyone knows his slew of later, goofier roles in movies such as the Naked Gun and Airplane.This film acts like it invented implausibly. Gene Hackman reverend moves, acts, and orders others around like he's the ship's captain though he has no previous knowledge of how the ship's design, or conceivably the physics of a cruise liner. Yet his motivation for acting like this was set up earlier. Before the ship sinks we get a sermon from this unorthodox preacher who believes in helping onesfelf instead of relying on Divine intervention. Likewise all the other characters follow along in their previously established types, never budging from this set character mold and certainly not evolving in any meaningful way.All of this is not to say the film isn't enjoyable. It is not high art after all. It knows full well it's purpose is to entertain the audience and nothing more. It does this quite well. Though its plot is strained it moves along with a quick pace and maintains a claustrophobic tension throughout.

Yes it is quite a violent movie in parts, and 'shoot em up movies' with lots of blood and gore aren't my preferred genre on the whole. But the balance struck in this movie is perfect. Let's face it, you couldn't make a movie about a wet boy without showing some violence. But so many directors could have gone overboard with that side of things. Instead of which Monsieur Besson and his merry band of players stops well short of unnecessary violence. It's a love story without sex, a comedy without banana skins, a drama without over-dramatisation, and above all else it's a heart warming story of a shy and in many ways insecure man taking care of a young girl living in an abusive family environment. Thankfully not once does the viewer read anything into the relationship between the man and the young girl other than what is there, i.e. mutual respect and friendship. The outro music (Shape Of My Heart by Sting) was not written for the movie specifically, but never fails to brings a lump to my throat each time I see Leon. Enrich your life, watch Leon!

I had put off watching it because it did not seem like a movie I would particularly enjoy. But in my quest to watch and review all of my movies, I had no choice but to put it in the player. Of course the fact that my wife wanted to watch it prompted me a little further even to the point of watching it out of alphabetical order.Frank Capra is the great godfather of sentimental movies. Many of these are deservedly hailed by fans and critics. From Mr Smith Goes to Washington to It's a Wonderful Life Capra made movies about the little guys fighting the system and coming out on top. These movies are sentimental enough to be dubbed Capracorn by the system, but are handled with masterful hands that rise above the schmaltz created by so many others. Besides little guys he also flooded his movies with eccentric characters standing out in a world full or normal folk. Arsenic and Old Lace and You Can't Take it With You are standouts of this form. Sadly, A Hole in the Head tries to mix both of these Capra types and fails on both accounts.The film is the second to last picture ever made by Capra and was the beginning of an attempted comeback from a few years break from making Hollywood pictures. But instead of a comeback this film serves only to remind us of what Capra used to be. Frank Sinatra plays a down on his luck big dreamer who is about to be evicted from his hotel business in Miami, Florida. He calls up his brother, Edward G Robinson and sister-in-law Thelma Ritter for help pretending his son is sick. Robinson and wife quickly head down from New York to see what's going on. Hilarity and sentimentality ensue. Swinging Sinatra butts heads with button down Robinson until a quick ending and easy solution are found.The performances of the stars are fine. At this point in their careers Sinatra and Robinson are essentially playing themselves. Although Sinatra is more up and coming to the declining Robinson. There are some good jokes and the simple story is fair enough as it is. Capra fills Sinatra's hotel with an odd collection of eccentrics that seem to have no other purpose but to fill up some time and tell a few jokes. The ending of the movie seems tied on and creates changes to some characters without any real provocation. The cheese factor is high even for a Capra film and it's not subdued by any superb performances. The drama is not elevated above the schlock you would see in a made for TV movie.The stand out of the film is Sinatra and son singing the classic High Hopes. Being a fan of Sinatra more as a singer than actor this amusing break in the middle of the picture helped keep my hopes up for a decent picture. Those hopes were not shattered, nor were they completely fulfilled. For beginners of Capracorn you should pick out some of his earlier, superior films. But for a lonely night in need of some corny sentiment, this is some fluffy candy that just might fill.More reviews at www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"3 May 2005","score":"16 out of 24 people found the following review useful","review":" Read all my reviews at www.midnitcafe.blogspot.comI received A Hole in the Head for my birthday in a Frank Sinatra double pack with the original Manchurian Candidate.

Many of these are deservedly hailed by fans and critics. From Mr Smith Goes to Washington to It's a Wonderful Life Capra made movies about the little guys fighting the system and coming out on top. These movies are sentimental enough to be dubbed Capracorn by the system, but are handled with masterful hands that rise above the schmaltz created by so many others. Besides little guys he also flooded his movies with eccentric characters standing out in a world full or normal folk. Arsenic and Old Lace and You Can't Take it With You are standouts of this form.

The expectations for this film were unrealistically high, George Lucas was going to get it from all angles. After 6 years and many viewings I still believe that it is entertaining, but it doesn't hold up to the other Star Wars films. Visually it is as good if not better than the previous trilogy, the planet of Naboo is impressive. What really doesn't hold it up is that it doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie at times. Many people complain about Jar Jar Binks as the problem, that the film was made to cater to the kiddie crowd. In a way, I agree that Lucas consciously went for the younger ones here, which is fine, but the main character of Anakin fails to capture the audience as he should. The movie really belongs to Liam Neeson. as Qui Gon, he creates a character that we like and respect, much as we did with Alec Guiness as Obi Wan in the previous trilogy. The obvious problem is that the movie had to set up a lot of plot points in one movie, the whole political situation leading to the invasion of Naboo bogs the movie down a bit.Still, can it honestly be viewed as a bad movie? Not at all. I believe that if this movie would have not had the Star Wars title that it would have been much better received by all. Out of the 5 films that are already out, it is the weakest least memorable. But if given a chance, there is much to appreciate. For instance, it has what I consider to be the BEST light saber fight of all the films so far. It had Darth Maul, a very cool villain w\\ho is painfully underused. Give the movie a break, though it is not as good as it should be, it is better than we are leads to believe.Grade B- ","genre":null},{"date":"3 May 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I saw PM when it came out, I liked it, and was less harsh than most fans and critics.
