[{"date":"21 November 1999","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Jim Carrey was uncanny in his impression of Andy Kaufman.  The film seemed to move along point by point recreating each significant event in the comedy career of Andy Kaufman, but it did little to add insight to who he was and what he was trying to do.  His sense of humor was well relayed but the characters lacked depth.  The relationship between Andy and Lynne Margolis was particularly underdeveloped despite a fine job by Courtney Love.  Prior fans of Andy Kaufman will find little of consequence in this film.
