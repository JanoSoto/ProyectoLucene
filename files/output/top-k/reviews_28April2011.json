But it just feels very forced all and of course the multiple rewrites that got done while shooting this movie certainly didn't helped with its end result.

Same goes for basically the entire returning cast members, who just don't impress all that much.Actually I think this movie would had been a lot better without all of the returning characters from the first movies and make this a movie on its own within the series, featuring all new characters. I say this because the idea of having the killer wander around the set of Stab 3, the movie within this movie, based on the Woodsboro killings from the previous movies, could had actually worked out quite well and interesting. It would had been a new, fresh take for the series but instead it now is something that is happening in the background all, most of the time.But calling this movie horrible also wouldn't be right. It's just that this movie disappoints on about every level, when compared to the first two movies out of the series. But as a standalone movie simple fact remains that this is a quite bad and lacking genre movie as well.

Doesn't really seem that long ago, does it? Well, I picked up the DVD in the bargain bin of a local store recently, and watched it tonight on the widescreen monitor attached to my computer.What a difference! The framing of all the shots suddenly makes sense, as does the absolutely amazing cinematography. It's a film built around photography, and that concept is reflected in the photography itself. Set design, choreography, camera angles -- it's all there. Having once been a professional photographer myself, I could really appreciate all the care that went into photographing this film.I was also very pleasantly surprised at how well Audrey Hepburn acquitted herself here. The role doesn't require much in the way of acting ability, but she gives it all she's got and makes Jo not only believable but sympathetic. She's not really a singer, but she handles her singing parts creditably. And though she isn't really a dancer, either, her dance numbers are outstanding. Ginger Rogers she ain't, but even next to Fred Astaire, her footwork is way above average. And how *graceful* she is! She carries off even her solo dance number with a balletic poise and flexibility that astonished me.As for Fred Astaire himself, he never at any point made a convincing romantic lead to me. Though a magnificent dancer, his screen persona was too much the cold fish to really play a passionate lover (as Gene Kelly certainly could). And his moment of Gosh, I never realized it before, but I must really be in love with this girl is just too much of an eye-roller. Even Laurence Olivier couldn't have pulled *that* one off.The multi-talented Kay Thompson, it need hardly be said, more than holds her own in the acting, singing and dancing categories.The script is by turns funny, banal, emotional and weak. Funny when it's gently skewering the fashion industry and self-righteous pseudo-intellectualism; banal in its clichéd and predictable love story; emotional when Audrey Hepburn gets to hint at the powerful emotions she can't reveal and weak in its rapturous Oui, oui, it's gay Paree! swoonfest over arriving in Paris.So, no, it's not one of the great classical musicals (even the chosen Gershwin songs were far from the best selections from that vast repertoire). But you've got to take the bad with the good, and the good is very good indeed. Recommended.PS Oh, and for God's sake, folks -- *puh-leeze* get off that age difference high horse.

Through a true story, he was revealing a secret that showed how menacing is his family, and how different he is. At the end, not only did he threaten his brother in law, but he killed him, and when asked by his wife, if it was true, he answered 'no', concluding one of the most fascinating characters' arcs in a movie. What happened in between is just the greatest cinematic metamorphosis, pure magic.This is not the story of a pure soul being corrupted, but the story of a soul whose only choice in order to protect someone dear was to become like him and therefore to realize that the crime that inhabited his father's life, not only could be justified, but ultimately, was the only destiny that could allow him to succeed. This is the irony of the American Dream, of a man who parodied the capitalism to underline its own limits, the same limits that ultimately built his power. An irony that inherited his youngest son, who lost his soul for the sake of blood loyalty losing principles for the sake of mightier principles.The fact is that some principles transcend the conventional ones, and if the father didn't want to be a puppet, he had to be the one who pulls the strings, like Presidents who don't pull the trigger, to be the ones to declare the war. More than an iconic cinematic allegory, the strings symbolize the tight frontier between being a legitimate politician and a respected criminal, in other words, being Vito Corleone. Being the master who gives you protection, in exchange of loyalty, letting you act knowingly that everything is under control. That's the point, with Vito, everything is under control. When he promises that the two thugs who brutalized a poor undertaker's daughter will get their comeuppance, we know he'll do it. Now, the question asked in the beginning is  which of his three sons will succeed to this exceptional man?The answer relies on one scene. Michael kisses his father's hand, in danger in the hospital, and tells him respectfully I'm with you, Pop and a tear runs in Vito's face. His son is protecting him and for some reason, we're almost sure that his father will survive, just like with the undertaker. The only man who inspired the same level of confidence than Vito is his son, Michael, who's (ironically again) the civilian, the non criminal. Not because the other sons were not meant to be Dons, the older one was Sonny, hot headed, good hearted, the other was as good hearted but weaken minded, both were criminals in a way or another. Michael was the one because he had to be. More than a story of succession, it's a story of destiny.And The Godfather is one of the greatest evolutions that ever enriched the silver screen. Mainly because of this story that everyone could relate to, one who loved his family and whose only choice was to corrupt his soul to protect it. It's not about crime, it's about the very necessities that make crime, not legitimate, but justifiable. It's not about crime; it's about its roots. It's not a crime or gangster movie, it's a movie where the crime setting highlights some principles like blood loyalty, friendship, or family that would have been meaningless in a more legitimate world. This is the thought provoking genius of The Godfather, that made it so universally appealing, because people from every cultures respect values like courage, loyalty, family, and respect itself.The nature of the story is just one of the pillars on which the greatness of The Godfather has built its legend ... and I focused on this because the rest has not to be proved the acting, the direction, the music, the quotes, the characters, the cinematography &#x85; every analyzable element is a living proof of the movie's closeness to perfection. Why should I develop this? If you read these lines, you know what I'm talking about, so let's keep this prudish and not try to be too enthusiastic. How ironic that the movie was based on a kind of pulp fiction novel &#x85; How ironic that the direction that made the movie with such confidence was so imperceptible &#x85; Indeed, Coppola makes us feel as part of this family, of the Corleones, they are criminals, yes, but the intimacy helps us to root for them &#x85; But another irony is that the direction is still present by these little details that gave the film its legendary feeling, every single death occurring has a little something that makes it memorable, from Khartoum's decapitation, to Sonny's ambush, from the restaurant to the baptism scenes, not to forget the two strangulations that opened and concluded the human deaths' series. The details are everywhere, in the script that enriched the cinematic language with so many iconic quotes, from delightful culinary parallels to other fishy metaphors &#x85; a script that transcended the novel, and made the film even more legendary.When it comes to defend The Godfather, I'm the most passionate fan you'll ever find, but I prefer to prevent this review from an overdose of superlatives. I know the movie is the greatest, not because it's my personal belief, but because I can't see another movie to top it, whatever cinematic category I use  story, acting, casting, writing, scoring, editing, direction &#x85; I can find a movie better in every element but not in all of them, and beyond all this technicality &#x85; it's just a movie that grows on you, after so many viewings, that shines cinematic respect in every single frame.

What happened in between is just the greatest cinematic metamorphosis, pure magic.This is not the story of a pure soul being corrupted, but the story of a soul whose only choice in order to protect someone dear was to become like him and therefore to realize that the crime that inhabited his father's life, not only could be justified, but ultimately, was the only destiny that could allow him to succeed. This is the irony of the American Dream, of a man who parodied the capitalism to underline its own limits, the same limits that ultimately built his power. An irony that inherited his youngest son, who lost his soul for the sake of blood loyalty losing principles for the sake of mightier principles.The fact is that some principles transcend the conventional ones, and if the father didn't want to be a puppet, he had to be the one who pulls the strings, like Presidents who don't pull the trigger, to be the ones to declare the war. More than an iconic cinematic allegory, the strings symbolize the tight frontier between being a legitimate politician and a respected criminal, in other words, being Vito Corleone. Being the master who gives you protection, in exchange of loyalty, letting you act knowingly that everything is under control. That's the point, with Vito, everything is under control. When he promises that the two thugs who brutalized a poor undertaker's daughter will get their comeuppance, we know he'll do it. Now, the question asked in the beginning is  which of his three sons will succeed to this exceptional man?The answer relies on one scene. Michael kisses his father's hand, in danger in the hospital, and tells him respectfully I'm with you, Pop and a tear runs in Vito's face. His son is protecting him and for some reason, we're almost sure that his father will survive, just like with the undertaker. The only man who inspired the same level of confidence than Vito is his son, Michael, who's (ironically again) the civilian, the non criminal. Not because the other sons were not meant to be Dons, the older one was Sonny, hot headed, good hearted, the other was as good hearted but weaken minded, both were criminals in a way or another. Michael was the one because he had to be. More than a story of succession, it's a story of destiny.And The Godfather is one of the greatest evolutions that ever enriched the silver screen. Mainly because of this story that everyone could relate to, one who loved his family and whose only choice was to corrupt his soul to protect it. It's not about crime, it's about the very necessities that make crime, not legitimate, but justifiable. It's not about crime; it's about its roots. It's not a crime or gangster movie, it's a movie where the crime setting highlights some principles like blood loyalty, friendship, or family that would have been meaningless in a more legitimate world. This is the thought provoking genius of The Godfather, that made it so universally appealing, because people from every cultures respect values like courage, loyalty, family, and respect itself.The nature of the story is just one of the pillars on which the greatness of The Godfather has built its legend ... and I focused on this because the rest has not to be proved the acting, the direction, the music, the quotes, the characters, the cinematography &#x85; every analyzable element is a living proof of the movie's closeness to perfection. Why should I develop this? If you read these lines, you know what I'm talking about, so let's keep this prudish and not try to be too enthusiastic. How ironic that the movie was based on a kind of pulp fiction novel &#x85; How ironic that the direction that made the movie with such confidence was so imperceptible &#x85; Indeed, Coppola makes us feel as part of this family, of the Corleones, they are criminals, yes, but the intimacy helps us to root for them &#x85; But another irony is that the direction is still present by these little details that gave the film its legendary feeling, every single death occurring has a little something that makes it memorable, from Khartoum's decapitation, to Sonny's ambush, from the restaurant to the baptism scenes, not to forget the two strangulations that opened and concluded the human deaths' series.

It is without a doubt the strangest film I have, or likely ever will see. Waking Life is all about the open discussion of surreal topics that common day people often consider too awkward to discuss. The film is shot with rotoscope animation, which means it was filmed in live action and edited with animation. The animation constantly changes styles and works to establish the surreal atmosphere and act as a direct system of symbolism. It works well and adds another layer to the experience. Waking Life resembles a documentary, jumping from one random person to another as they monologue or give an anecdote. Approximately half of the film centers around an unnamed protagonist wandering through the universe and interviewing several people about the characteristics of lucid dreams. The rest of the film touches on a number of topics including the meaning of life, brain activity, politics and free will. And herein lies the main problem with Waking Life, it tries to do too much. About half of the segments are compelling and interesting, a majority of them on the dream subject. The rest encounter a multitude of issues. A lot of the monologues are spoken very quickly with a lot of strong information that the film does not give the viewer time to take in. It tries to drill philosophy and psychology into one's head, often on subject which the viewer has little to no background knowledge. There is one segment where existentialism is discussed. While I've heard of existentialism before, I'd have liked to receive a formal definition before being thrust into a deep discussion. There were times when I was just praying for the film to shut up and take a breath. Because of this, one must accept a passive role in watching the film, which makes parts of it boring. This is exacerbated by the fact the film is nonlinear, constantly changing subjects, occasionally revisiting several, with no consistent pattern. The film's purpose becomes highly confusing and some debates receive no resolution. Granted that's likely intentional, but it doesn't add to the experience. Some segments seem to serve no purpose at all. There is one scene with a man in a jail cell ranting about how he wants to burn somebody. I was simply baffled at its mere existence, let alone its message, which I couldn't decipher. However, the scenes and discussions that are comprehensible and presented well are beyond incredible. They really make the viewer think about their own personal psyche, even days after the film's conclusion. The scenes focused on dreaming and the story arc with the protagonist is where the film really shines, and again, you can only understand if you see it. The conversations he is engaged seem to be in their own universe, and each in a different one. The film appears to collect its thoughts and becomes much more linear towards the end which ends the experience on a high note. I won't exactly say I enjoyed Waking Life, but I heavily admire it for its ambition and atmosphere. Despite its numerous drawbacks, I'm choosing to label Waking Life as a must see film for everyone. This is primarily because no two viewers will have the same experience. Everyone will interpret the film's messages differently; and while I may not have been able to completely immerse myself in all of the film's content, I'm sure certain people will fare better.

I was very disappointed when I finally watched it- it's two hours and forty minutes of the most numbing, predictable, incessant over-acting and cringe-worthy clichés.The first forty minutes of the movie are good enough to suck you in, as Treat Williams plays a crooked, guilt-ridden cop who decides to cooperate with Internal Affairs to nab other crooked cops. I won't rat on my partners, he vows, and the rest of the movie is spent watching him rat on his partners. Treat Williams' performance is embarrassing, and he spends the movie screaming tough-guy monologues too dumb for Acting 101. He genuinely looks clueless in certain parts of the movie, going over-the-top and practically begging for an Oscar nomination. It's pathetic.But it's not all his fault Director Sidney Lumet makes this the kitchen sink of cop dramas. The movie features 22 lawyer characters that could have easily been condensed down to 3... there are too many cops and way too much dialogue, so much redundancy and so much extraneous information that by the second half of the movie I simply stopped keeping score. Williams' character is either incredibly naive or incredibly stupid if he believes he's going to get out of this situation cleanly... watching him rant and rave over the inevitabilities that come with turning state's evidence is infuriating How the HELL did I get here?!?You volunteered.There is an odd homosexual undertone to the movie as the male characters all touch and hug one another far too long and far too often. The protection of Williams' character by Federal Agents is laughable he's allowed to get out of the car in strange neighborhoods and approach crime lords and only then do the two sixty-something bodyguards run up to make sure no one tries to off him. Ridiculous. When the Uncle Nick character is whacked and his body discovered in a garbage can the actor clearly blinks and breathes- not once but twice during a sloppy, lingering shot. Subplots about Williams' brother and father are dropped without any resolution. Lindsay Crouse as Carla is in an entirely different movie, and her character makes little or no sense within the film we're watching. Characters have absurd and exaggerated names, with occasionally hilarious results We're gonna bring in Marinaro and Mayo can easily be confused with mayonnaise and tomato sauce.I always like to find one good thing in a film and here it is Ron Karabatsos as DeBennedeto. The man is an absolute natural on screen, and one of those actors you never doubt for a split second as the character he's playing. It's a shame the direction lets him go to waste. Why Sidney Lumet didn't edit this film down to its core is beyond me... it's endless bureaucratic talking heads broken up by Treat's screeching and the promise of action that Never arrives.I think Sidney Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon is one of the greatest movies ever made- it's in my Top Twenty all-time. I also think Serpico is great, but I have to call 'em like I see 'em... Prince Of The City is a ponderous bore, a turgid slog through the most insignificant and grating aspects of police informants and legal technicalities. It's a disaster- like a movie stitched together from deleted scenes of the worst episodes of Law & Order. At one point in the movie a federal attorney who we've never seen before- and will never see again- asks to speak to Treat Williams for a moment. Treat stands up and puts down his sandwich, but the lawyer assures him he can bring the sandwich with him for this particular meeting. He does, and neither the scene, the lawyer or the sandwich is ever mentioned again. For me this sums up the entire movie too many details, too many characters, and way too much talking without any payoff at all.GRADE D- ","genre":null},{"date":"28 April 2011","score":"5 out of 15 people found the following review useful","review":" For years I have heard that Sidney Lumet's Prince Of The City was a lost classic, a sleeper hit that was under-appreciated, a gem.

I was very disappointed when I finally watched it- it's two hours and forty minutes of the most numbing, predictable, incessant over-acting and cringe-worthy clichés.The first forty minutes of the movie are good enough to suck you in, as Treat Williams plays a crooked, guilt-ridden cop who decides to cooperate with Internal Affairs to nab other crooked cops. I won't rat on my partners, he vows, and the rest of the movie is spent watching him rat on his partners. Treat Williams' performance is embarrassing, and he spends the movie screaming tough-guy monologues too dumb for Acting 101. He genuinely looks clueless in certain parts of the movie, going over-the-top and practically begging for an Oscar nomination. It's pathetic.But it's not all his fault Director Sidney Lumet makes this the kitchen sink of cop dramas. The movie features 22 lawyer characters that could have easily been condensed down to 3... there are too many cops and way too much dialogue, so much redundancy and so much extraneous information that by the second half of the movie I simply stopped keeping score. Williams' character is either incredibly naive or incredibly stupid if he believes he's going to get out of this situation cleanly... watching him rant and rave over the inevitabilities that come with turning state's evidence is infuriating How the HELL did I get here?!?You volunteered.There is an odd homosexual undertone to the movie as the male characters all touch and hug one another far too long and far too often. The protection of Williams' character by Federal Agents is laughable he's allowed to get out of the car in strange neighborhoods and approach crime lords and only then do the two sixty-something bodyguards run up to make sure no one tries to off him. Ridiculous. When the Uncle Nick character is whacked and his body discovered in a garbage can the actor clearly blinks and breathes- not once but twice during a sloppy, lingering shot. Subplots about Williams' brother and father are dropped without any resolution. Lindsay Crouse as Carla is in an entirely different movie, and her character makes little or no sense within the film we're watching.

The fact that he wrote this 1994 family comedy adventure was how I discovered it just very recently, nearly seventeen years after it came out. It was made in my childhood, coming into theatres when I was nearly eight years old, but I never heard of it until probably earlier this year. The title and premise of Baby's Day Out suggest that the movie is pretty darn cheesy, and they certainly don't lie. While exploring Hughes' work in recent years, I've seen both good and not so good movies from the late filmmaker, and was expecting this to be one of the latter, which it sadly is.Baby Bink Cotwell lives in a mansion with his loving parents, Laraine and Bennington. His favourite bedtime book is Baby's Day Out, which his Nanny Gilbertine constantly reads to him. He is about to have his picture taken for the newspaper, but three con artists, Eddie, Norby, and Veeko, come to the mansion disguised as newspaper photographers, and when nobody else is looking, they kidnap the baby! They take Bink back to their apartment with them, but trying to control him turns out to be difficult. To try and get him to sleep, Norby reads him the Baby's Day Out book, but he ends up being the one who falls asleep instead, and Bink then manages to escape through the window. The kidnappers soon discover that he has escaped and go out to try and catch him. The baby crawls around through the city as the criminals pursue him, but as close as they often get, they can't seem to ever catch up to him! Meanwhile, FBI agents have come to help the Cotwells find their missing infant son.For a while, it looked like nothing here was going to tickle my funny bone at all, and I don't think this changed until the three antagonists get the baby to their apartment. These three characters aren't funny while they pose as photographers, but after this, they sure can be funny as they try to keep the baby under control and then pursue him in the streets. Their conflict is often the reason for this, and without these characters, I might have found Baby's Day Out to be one dull movie! However, even these criminal characters aren't always funny (it's still USUALLY straight-faced, even with all the screen time the antagonists have), and lots of unfunny things happen to them during their pursuit of Baby Bink. That doesn't exactly include the crotch-on-fire segment, though I'm not sure what I would have thought of that part as a kid. I guess a movie can have a ridiculous premise and still be entertaining, but I still didn't find the premise here too fascinating. In addition to being mostly unfunny, this is also a predictable film.Home Alone, the 1990 Christmas movie written and produced by John Hughes, turned out to be an amazingly high grossing blockbuster. I saw it for the first time just a couple years ago (though I definitely knew about it long before then), and if you ask me, that film certainly is overrated, but still better than this one. Baby's Day Out has a premise a lot like its far more popular predecessor, with a kid rivaling adult criminals who are in pursuit of him, only it's more extreme this time, with the kid being just a baby. I know many would disagree with me on this one, but I think this particular family adventure film doesn't have a lot of merit. It blends in with such other lacklustre 90's Hughes films as Flubber and the live action remake of 101 Dalmatians. Now, some people clearly LOVE this movie, and I don't look down on them for that, but I'm not expecting to ever come anywhere near being part of that crowd.

This however, was not the intention of its creators. Godzilla is more than a movie about a giant rubber monster that comes out of the ocean and devours Japan. Godzilla is a powerful symbol of the distressing after-math of the atomic bomb on Japan that also represents the evils of science, and a countries ability to deal with disaster. Throughout its many translations, the serious message in Godzilla has been completely over-looked and lost. The fact still remains however, that Godzilla is the beast of war. There is vivid imagery throughout the 1954 film of Gojira, that depicts WWII and it's effect on the people. An example of this would be the overflowing hospital after Godzilla attacks the city. During these scenes, heartache and death were depicted when innocent children were screaming for lost family members. It is implied that the purpose of those scenes is to identify the similar consequences of the Japan bombing. Another scene involves some citizens on a train talking about the safest place to hide from Godzilla, when one man mentions taking his family to the shelters, another man responds, the shelters again?

With over 180 reviews (admittedly, many extremely negative) and 14 message board pages (and counting!) dedicated to it on this site alone, with more than a thousand comments pro and con (with the message board comments overwhelmingly majority pro it should be noted) about this incredibly funny, albeit dark movie, I think everyone would have to agree, Nothing But Trouble is at the very least an interesting nexus for thought, and perhaps worthy of some consideration from those who would see it cast to the bottom of the Worst One Hundred movie pit. It certainly does not belong there, with some of the most fabulous sets and set pieces I've ever seen in any movie, and truly greatest ensemble slap-stick choreography this side of the Hal Roach Studios.

The team consisted of Jim Phelps (Jon Voigt), his wife Claire Phelps (Emmanuelle Beart), Sarah Davies (Kristin Scott Thomas), Hannah Williams (Ingeborga Dapkunaite) and Jack (Emilio Estevez). The mission, to stop an American diplomat from selling off a NOC list filled with the identities of covert agents. With Ethan the only one of his team that appeared to be left standing found that the real mission was the attempt by his unofficial CIA organization to smoke out a mole. He is left to seek the truth by making some unlikely alliances and commit to steal the real NOC list and sell it off to the initial buyers to do some smoking out of his own.The theme of the movie revolves around the idea of the world closing in around someone and in the face of adversity to face it head on and see it through to the end. This can be shown in many action packed sequences in the film when Ethan takes a piece of exploding gum to narrowly escape situations where the audience is felt like he is backed in a corner with nowhere to go. There are other situations in the film where he is trying to prevent the world from closing in around him by placing his own traps to warn him of impending danger. Ethan the hero always tries to stay one step ahead of everyone so that the same repeat of misfortune doesn't rear its ugly head.Mission Impossible falls in the lines of action packed movies like The Bourne Identity or even James Bond movies, smart and inventive keeping audiences on their toes, trying to guide the viewers to think one step ahead with the main character. To emphasize the action in the scenes Mission Impossible incorporates both slow motion and fast paced motion. When Ethan escapes the restaurant after meeting with Kittridge (Henry Czerny), the stick of exploding gum is thrown against an aquarium creating a diversion that follows a slow motion scene of him escaping unharmed. When Ethan is chasing the villain trying to escape from a high speed train to a helicopter, he stops at nothing to make sure that good prevails. Once again the exploding gum saves the day when the helicopter pilot tries to decapitate Ethan with the blades of the helicopter. This sequence, as unrealistic as it seems, is made realistic with the wind whipping the actor's clothes and hair while the background zips by. The sounds are brought to life with the thunderous noise of the train on the tracks, the wind and the helicopter following close behind.The movie isn't a part of my favorite genre and sometimes find myself having to see these action films more than once because there is so much going on. I did like the movie but I can't say it's one of my favorites. It definitely is a must see and recommend it to anyone who wants to see a good movie with a good plot and action packed.

This is a perfect title because it shows the men who look a little bit worn out, and then the food they are about to eat. It is a large piece of meat hanging in the dining hall with no refrigeration. The camera gets an up close shot to reveal that there are maggots crawling all over the piece of meat. This disgusts the sailors, but the doctor insists it is okay and nothing to worry about. The sailors disapprove and decide to rebel. This caused the officers (who were very well taken care of) to attempt to execute the sailors that had caused trouble. They were about to fire when a sailor named Vakulinchuk speaks up. He gives a motivational talk and asks everybody on board whose side they were on. As they lower their guns, an officer grabs it to try to fire, but this only caused chaos to break out. The only person that ended up getting shot was Vakulinchuk. Once they become docked and anchored at Odessa, the townspeople come out to give honor to Vakulinchuk. The shot shows streams of people and it seems never ending. This invokes a feeling of togetherness and pride. During this, a group of Czar soldiers appear and start firing on the crowd, including children, women, and the elderly. The sailors realize that this was going to turn into a bigger fight and turn the ship around to face opposing ships head-on. Once they get closer though, they realize it is fellow sailors.

Minnelli builds a deep and vigorous drama of sound atmospheres, which is one of the tops of his films.The Bad and the Beautifulis one of the most celebrated melodramas master Minelli, and it is to be able to combine in countless history topics, narrate naturally. It is a film filled with a unique sense of glamour, with an excellent cast, where even the ever hieratic and expressionless Lana Turner, is splendid.The film has excellent black and white photography, which gives the mythical air of homage to a world that at the time of its realization was beginning to be almost a relic of the past.

The excellent use of editing, sound, and music drive this thriller home. Even the title of the movie is a succinct preview of the greater theme present throughout the film; foreboding and mysterious. Obviously, at least one of the main characters will die because of the affair. The question that haunts you throughout the storyline is which one? The film begins by showing Dan Gallagher as a kind, but sexually frustrated family man. With his wife gone for the weekend, his fling with the seemingly innocent Alex appears to be harmless fun. But his indiscretion begins to catch up with him soon. Alex's sociopathic tendencies begin to become apparent as she begins to harass Dan at work, calling and visiting him regularly. What seemed like a one night stand becomes a haunting and difficult ordeal. The violence, emotion, and unpredictability throughout the show will make it impossible to look away. Fatal Attraction is a must-see thriller and a pioneer in its genre. This film will suck you in and make you empathize with Dan and his loving wife Beth. The amount of detail and emotion director Adrian Lyne and his team included in the film makes it impossible to watch with detachment. If you have ever known or dated a sociopath, you will certainly see the accuracy with which Alex's behavior was portrayed. My favorite scene exposing her personality and bipolar state is when she listens to Madame Butterfly, staring blankly into space and flicking the lamp on and off. Her obsession, and the lengths she will go to in order to get what she wants, is oddly familiar and simultaneously eerie. A key component of this film is the dead-on use of sound editing and music. These allow us to share Dan's attraction and sense of connection with Alex, and later his sense of dread as she ruthlessly attacks everything he loves. From the whisper of their adolescent, flirting banter in the beginning to the scream of the teakettle near the end, the choice of sound is appropriate and fitting for this storyline. If you liked other thrillers such as Cape Fear, Fatal Attraction will be right up your alley. Marital infidelity will never seem the same.
