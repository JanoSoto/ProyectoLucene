Physically you're still 15.Samantha Baker's opening line bemoaning her breast size. And that one dry observation is just the beginning of Samantha's hellish 16th birthday in Sixteen Candles, the debut feature from that king of the teen movies John Hughes.Sixteen Candles is very special for the simple reason that John Hughes showed other filmmakers of the day what a teen movie could be all about. Instead of an orgy of sex, booze and all night partying, films starring teenagers could be about real people. Young people with problems of their own. Fears. Insecurities. And a healthy dollop of angst.Sixteen Candles takes all of those qualities and makes a surprisingly fun film out of it. Even at the start of his career, John Hughes has made a film that's buoyant, brimming with confidence and delightfully dotty. Its everything a teen film should be.The film that put Molly Ringwald on the map shows off her budding talent. She really is quite wonderful in the role of Samantha because she must encapsulate a lot of emotions. Especially when the emotions of those around her are particularly running high.Even though its Samantha's birthday, her family are much more preoccupied with her elder sister Ginny's wedding. They completely forget that its her birthday. If that weren't bad enough, Samantha's high school crush Jake doesn't even know she exists, she's being hounded by The Geek (a sex-starved Anthony Michael Hall), she's been lumbered with a Chinese foreign exchange student, and there's a party to go to.Sixteen Candles is quite a breezy film. Its a very confident debut for John Hughes. There are touches that would become hallmarks for Hughes. Carefully etched characters. His ear for teenspeak. And quirkiness. Hughes is known for having a certain quirky touch but in Sixteen Candles it really goes into overdrive. And that may be the film's only fault.Yes its a very funny film to be sure. But sometimes it feels like Hughes is more interested in springing the next oddball quirk on us than getting on and telling the story. The film is downright crazy at times. TV themes on the soundtrack (if well employed). Surreal images. There were times when these little curiosities quite wore me out. Every scene has something odd about it. Except one. The scene where Samantha's father Jim (Paul Dooley) sits her down and apologises for missing out on what may have been the most important birthday in Samantha's life. Its the one scene in the whole film where Hughes forgets about being nutty and concentrates on the characters themselves. Hughes is always at his best when he directs his own scripts, and this scene in particular really shines.Jim and Samantha actually feel like a real father and daughter. He doesn't quite connect on her level, but he senses her problems and offers to be a sympathetic ear, if not a solution to them. A wonderful scene brilliantly written and performed to perfection by Dooley and Ringwald.There is an actual plot going on throughout all the wackiness Hughes has let loose. And Ringwald is at the centre of it. This may in fact be her best performance. Not only because it feels like her truest film character, but she is exactly the same age as Samantha. 16. And that's why Ringwald so completely identifies with Samantha so perfectly.The film also has a very appealing list of co-stars around the edges of the story. At the head of the line is Anthony Michael Hall, suitably geekish without actually looking like a geek. At least he doesn't wear the thick glasses and lots of zits that crop up in many a teen movie's list of stereotypes.Hall wants to nail Samantha, the girl of his dreams so he can score points with all his geek pals. But in a surprisingly sweet scene, the two open up to each other instead. Its a moment where Hughes changes tack, and their relationship rotates from testy to understanding. Samantha confides in Hall her problems and being unlucky in love, and The Geek quite surprisingly offers to help out in a way that doesn't feel contrived at all. There are lots of neat little cameos from a few early risers. Look out for brother and sister John & Joan Cusack. John forms a part of the Geek Trio, and although Joan walks through the film sporting an unsightly neck brace, she shows her considerable talent for physical comedy without having to do much of anything. Just the sight of her in that thing is worth the price of admission alone!Kramer vs Kramer star Justin Henry is perfectly horrid as Samantha's brattish brother Mike. Haviland Morris is perfectly bitchy as Jake's Prom Queen girlfriend Caroline, and Gedde Watanabe perfectly wacky as Long Duk Dong, the Chinese exchange student. His antics may seem offensive to some nitpickers, but since he looks like he's having so much fun, who cares?Michael Schoeffling is a bit on the bland side as Jake, but the way he and Samantha come together is still quite nice. John Hughes would continue to improve in the teen genre with greater and greater hits. But the sight gags, witty performances and sharp dialogue ensure Sixteen Candles will always remain a classic.

It's really a human interest story, and the story of the sad figure of the ex-boxer who can't fight but who also can't seem to let go rings true - and, with the benefit of time, perhaps it's made to seem even more real by the presence in the opening scenes of the movie of Cassius Clay, playing himself in a fictional fight against Rivera. Clay, of course, would become Muhammad Ali - perhaps the greatest fighter ever but also one who, in the end, had trouble letting go even though his body had failed him.Quinn's performance as Rivera was, I thought, a little bit awkward at times, but he definitely captured the emotional angst of a man whose entire life had been boxing (in the days before boxers made huge dollars) and who suddenly faced the uncertainty of life outside the ring. Julie Harris plays an employment counsellor who enters his life in the hope of helping him make the transition to a new life. She played the part well, but frankly I thought the quasi-romance between the two was too contrived and just not believable.

If you want action with incredulous escapes, go & watch any of the OO7 movies with Brosnan or others, or maybe the Indiana Jones adventures, or the likes of The Eye of the Needle & Three Days of The Condor & you'll be far better served than here!

All well & good, but note no comment from them on the chances of a vehicles on fire with its tyres burning & still driving on regardless, occupants safely inside, insightful dog waiting to be rescued at high speed & just happening to be in the path of their escape, let alone a sinking motor boat with motor seized up in boiling waters, but just enough momentum to make the shore, where the heat is somehow not overwhelming. But there's so much more in close escapes, not to mention the trusty government subordinate being right, while his boss belittles his contributions in public, earlier on. True enough. There's a lot of blind bosses out there, but you could see it all coming, so predictably, in this lame offering! But yes, it will appeal to lovers of disaster movie dramas. It's just that this was made close to 30 years after The Poseidon Adventure & little imagination of progress is anywhere evident.I enjoyed watching it, once but that's all. If you want action with incredulous escapes, go & watch any of the OO7 movies with Brosnan or others, or maybe the Indiana Jones adventures, or the likes of The Eye of the Needle & Three Days of The Condor & you'll be far better served than here! I also saw a movie I'd never heard of till today, named The Blue Butterfly, & it was far better than this ordinary re-production of other disaster movies.

I would suggest even 007 & these companions in this one, would have surely been immersed into the wreckage several times in reality! I note comments on this site from scientific experts supporting the accuracy of its information about volcanoes.

Why she hasn't gotten more substantial roles is just beyond me. The movie at first seems at bit confused but as soon as the romantic attraction between Rossellini and Danson begins to surface one just float away with the romantic hope that love is this easy - of course it seldom is, but at least we can see it here on screen. I usually detest the awful trend of remaking original (often movies with another language than English) movies for the American audience, but this one is very true to the original, so I'll let it slide for once. Kudos to all in the cast.
