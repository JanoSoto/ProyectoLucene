The war at the very beginning; also great, but every scene in this movie was great in their own way, so.It's the classic good meets evil, slave meets emperor, right meets wrong, all these classic and endless feuds have all come together in this movie, in a fight, a fight that will not stop until there is but one left standing.David Franzoni wrote the story and David Franzoni wrote the screenplay, and he did an indescribable, magnificent job doing that. You don't believe me? Ask the 5 Oscars, 45 other awards and 79 other award nominations this movie got.This movie is (believe it or not) based on emotions. In fact all movies are. Take away the emotions and what have you got left? Nothing! What is a fight in the arena without rage? What is a relationship without love? What is a good day without happiness? What is the point of righteousness if there is no wrong in the world?

Power is one of those elusive qualities that we all aspire to have. We seek it through money, through education, through politics, and through our social ties.

There were other individuals and nations that managed to conquer much of the world Alexander the Great is the most famous, and Napoleon wreaked some havoc in his time. But since the fall of the Roman Empire, that level of sheer power has not been matched. Everything with this movie is awesome. The acting, the lighting, staging, music, everything. I can actually not think of one single thing with this movie that is less than awesome. True story.Well, I am guessing you have probably figured this out already, but this was a good movie.

That is basically what sums up Pulp Fiction. Quentin Tarantino wasn't really known before Pulp Fiction, but after this movie he became one of the best directors in recent memory. I can't even tell you what the movie is about. Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis all have their stories and they all somehow intertwine, that's really it. The plot makes no sense and the entire movie is confusing from the opening to ending credits. After the credits roll your mind starts piecing together and then you will realize that this movie is unique and brilliant.From the first scene of the movie I was hooked. The audience is introduced to Pulp Fiction in the middle of a conversation at a diner. Honey Bunny and Pumpkin are talking and my attention was drawn to my TV. I intended on multitasking on the internet while watching but instantly I was drawn into their conversation. I recognized Tim Roth from Lie to Me and was curious what he was doing in this movie. The entire scene was just brilliant starting with a simple conversation and ending with a robbery of the diner. Then it was the next scene. I put the laptop down because I knew this movie deserved my full attention. Pulp Fiction is simply classic Tarantino. The original story, similar actors, creative dialogue, and an amazing score push the story along and make it what it is. Other than Travolta, there really is no main character. I consider the script and the words the characters say as a character. If you break the movie down, very little actually happens. Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson have a solid 10-15 minute conversation about cheeseburgers and a foot massage. I don't know how they did it but they made a conversation about a foot massage very entertaining. A script like Pulp Fiction's does not come around lightly. This was one of the most interesting and captivating screenplays I have ever seen on film. There is not one boring scene in this movie because of the interesting conversations. This movie has a very long list of big actors, my favorite being Christopher Walken. He is only in the movie for one scene, but it is my favorite scene. Young Butch is watching TV and incomes Walken playing his father's POW friend. His father fought and died in the war and Walken had something to give him. Walken goes on a speech about a gold watch his father and himself hid from the Vietnamese. The delivery and presentation in this scene is hysterical. The camera never moves, all we see is Walken holding the watch and telling his story. It is a scene like this where you feel the words and their impact. I will say it all throughout this review; the words are what make this movie. As far as plot, there really is none. There are stories of individuals whose lives intertwine. What makes this movie special is that the scenes are out of order. I loved that it had this effect. The movie starts in the diner and then we never see them again, until the end. It's brilliant. After the movie I took a piece of paper and drew out the Pulp Fiction timeline. If a movie makes you think then it does its job, but this went above and beyond. I wanted to re-watch the movie in the correct sequence, but honestly, if I did, the movie is awful. If this movie was in the order of events it would be pointless and meaningless. It would be a ridiculous movie with weird dialogue. Instead, the audience is left wondering what is going on and we get sucked into the universe that is, Quentin Tarantino. Do I like that the movie is out of order? Well, yes and no. My really only problem is that all of the actors are seen once and most of them are never seen again. In the first opening scenes Samuel L. Jackson was so entertaining but then he left and we don t see him again for a very long time. The movie skips ahead to Travolta and Uma Thurman's night on the town. I missed seeing Samuel L. Jackson on screen. Then we get sucked into Bruce Willis' story and I missed Travolta and Uma Thurman, but I was so interested with Bruce Willis, I didn't even care. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I loved these characters and wanted to see all of them at once, which I realize isn't possible. I wanted them to have more interaction with each other, but then again, that would have probably made the movie a lot worse. Another problem with the scene jumping is the irrelevance of events. Once scene one character gets blown away and killed by another. At that time it was a huge deal because one of the characters died, but in the next sequence he was alive again walking around being awesome. It took away from his death and almost made it pointless. If you pay attention towards the end we see why he dies but it almost seemed unnecessary and random that he died. Tarantino made this movie not intending to make a sequel, but he never reveals what is in the briefcase that Jules carries around. Why not? What is in it? I want to know. Overall, Pulp Fiction was a masterpiece of writing. The screenplay and how the actors acted out the words on the page is what made this movie a classic. I didn't want to see this movie because people said it deserved Best Picture over Forrest Gump in 1994. I didn't want to believe there was a better movie then that, but I liked this movie more. I think Forrest Gump deserved the Oscar but Pulp Fiction still gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.

Except this If you haven't seen the movie, and think like I did that you'll be disappointed doing so, see it anyway.I did. And I was disappointed, at least the first time I saw it. It was good, I thought, but not that good. Like this character gets killed off too quickly, or the movie spends too much time away from the main story following one character in Sicily, or that famous lilting melody I grew up with doesn't come up for over an hour. I thought it was good, but overrated.But then I saw it again. Wow, what a difference. Three hours flew so quickly, and I found myself totally immersed in the many different stories going on simultaneously, as well as the way director Francis Ford Coppola weaves them so effectively. The Godfather has this ability to hit you a completely different way when you see it again, because there's so much depth to what you see on screen at any given moment. But at the same time, unlike a lot of deep-thought pictures, it's wonderfully accessible, at least to a multiple-time viewer like me.The story at the heart of things is simple. A mafia family, the Corleones, are going through a rough patch. Don Vito (Marlon Brando) appears to be slipping as rival crime families vie to get into the narcotics market, which Don Vito has always eschewed. After one particularly rough gangster named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) makes a move on the Don, its up to Vito's previously clean son Michael (Al Pacino) to involve himself in family affairs and help Pop out.That the Corleones are the underdogs in this movie is part of its brilliant perversity. The movie gets you rooting for them, to the point where your journey becomes similar to Michael's. The corruption he embraces in pursuit of his father's salvation becomes something you root for, until at the end, when it culminates in an orgy of violence, you might like me get as pumped about it as you would be watching your favorite sports team pull out a come-from-behind win.Great dialogue, too, fantastically delivered. Everyone is so excellent in this movie, yet at the same time so understated. From the direction to the cinematography to the music, there's a quietness to the movie that's almost eerie, and does a lot to pull you in. Pacino, Brando, and Lettieri could all be big actors, but they all keep it contained here, especially Brando whose opening scene as the Don sets the bar very high. James Caan is the closest this movie has to an outsized performance, as Michael's hot-tempered older brother Sonny, but even he only boils up once in a while. The phrase It's not personal, it's business, comes up a few times in this movie, and the scary thing is it really is for them.Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. And if you have already, and didn't think it was that great, see it again. You may wind up as amazed as me at what a difference a second viewing can make.

Except this If you haven't seen the movie, and think like I did that you'll be disappointed doing so, see it anyway.I did. And I was disappointed, at least the first time I saw it. It was good, I thought, but not that good. Like this character gets killed off too quickly, or the movie spends too much time away from the main story following one character in Sicily, or that famous lilting melody I grew up with doesn't come up for over an hour. I thought it was good, but overrated.But then I saw it again. Wow, what a difference. Three hours flew so quickly, and I found myself totally immersed in the many different stories going on simultaneously, as well as the way director Francis Ford Coppola weaves them so effectively. The Godfather has this ability to hit you a completely different way when you see it again, because there's so much depth to what you see on screen at any given moment. But at the same time, unlike a lot of deep-thought pictures, it's wonderfully accessible, at least to a multiple-time viewer like me.The story at the heart of things is simple. A mafia family, the Corleones, are going through a rough patch. Don Vito (Marlon Brando) appears to be slipping as rival crime families vie to get into the narcotics market, which Don Vito has always eschewed. After one particularly rough gangster named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) makes a move on the Don, its up to Vito's previously clean son Michael (Al Pacino) to involve himself in family affairs and help Pop out.That the Corleones are the underdogs in this movie is part of its brilliant perversity. The movie gets you rooting for them, to the point where your journey becomes similar to Michael's. The corruption he embraces in pursuit of his father's salvation becomes something you root for, until at the end, when it culminates in an orgy of violence, you might like me get as pumped about it as you would be watching your favorite sports team pull out a come-from-behind win.Great dialogue, too, fantastically delivered. Everyone is so excellent in this movie, yet at the same time so understated. From the direction to the cinematography to the music, there's a quietness to the movie that's almost eerie, and does a lot to pull you in.

But during all the classics and tripe I've endured over the years, Mary Poppins has somehow managed to evade me. I was too busy watching rabbits getting torn to pieces in Watership Down (1978) and clapping giddily at Rocky Balboa's training montage in Rocky (1976) as a child to be distracted by something quite as colourful as this. So, it's at the ripe old age of 28 that I came round to sitting through Mary Poppins, to struggle through its squeaky-clean visage and many, many songs that I somehow knew all the words to before seeing the film. Well, I was wrong to be so cynical, as although the film is hardly what I would call a classic, it's really rather good.London, 1910. Merry jack-of-all-trades Bert (Dick Van Dyke) is playing a one-man-band to an enthusiastic street audience when he senses something magical in the air, signalling the return of his good friend Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews). He takes us into the stable yet unhappy Banks' family home, where the household is ran by lord-of-his-castle Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson), and his suffragette wife Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns). Busy attending to work and other matters, the Banks' have started to neglect their children, Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber). After their umpteenth nanny walks out on them, Mr. Banks makes a desperate newspaper plea for a nanny who will lay down the law, and teach the children respect and the harshness of life. So enters Mary Poppins, 'perfect in every way', a nanny who is as strict as she needs to be but one capable of also showing the children the joys of life.Mary Poppins suffers mainly from the same thing that I feel plagues most musicals - it's too long. Seemingly every musical feels the need to round-up every change of emotion and sub-plot with a grand song-and- dance number that gets old quickly. The first half of the film is pure family entertainment, with memorable songs and some stunning special effects (for its day) making the film zip by happily. Then the songs get more clunky and forgettable, and we are exposed to much more of Dick Van Dyke's terrible accent and his grating, over-enthusiastic Bert than we need (although I'm sure he has his many fans). Yet after the somewhat exhausting 139 minutes is over, Poppins still leaves you with that cuddly feeling inside, something I thought had died inside me when I sprouted my first pube.Most of the success of Poppins comes from the performance of Julie Andrews. All sweet and idyllic, she could have come across as a stuck-up Miss Perfect, but Andrews' effortless likability and stage experience makes her more of a supernatural missionary, sent to make a stand against Mr. Banks' stern and rigid outlook on life. Disney were really coming out of their Golden Era at the time of this being released, but it's still one of their most fondly remembered, and certainly their most critically successful live-action efforts. It's more than likely that children will turn away from it, due to the mega-bucks spewed into children's films these days, but it will continue to enchant adults, especially those that grew up with it, and even those new to it, like me. Chim-chimernee, chim-ernee, chim chim, cheroo! Damn it, it's in my head again!

However, for the sheer scope and ubiquity of the subject matter tackled in High Fidelity, I rank it #1 in my All-time favorite movies category.First off, it approaches relationships from the perspective of any emotionally confused, disenfranchised, 20something male, making it a rare gem for that viewing demographic. The opening sequence launches directly into this motif, as Rob's girlfriend (Laura) is packing her things to leave as he primes us for the main theme of the movie tracing his relationships with women to the present day in an attempt to uncover a solution to his broken love life. His revelations throughout the narrative reflect the selfishness inherent in his age, and by the time he comes to an emotional nirvana at the end, you almost want him to suffer a lonely life (but not in a sequel). Alas, this story is happier than reality would allow him to be.The musical flavor of the narrative is central in the same way that the computer theme was central in the Tron movies. Music saturates this movie. Rob (John Cusack) is a music lover running a record store in the heart of Chicago, which gave us modern Jazz and House. Although technically a 90s genre film, the script (which comes from the eponymous British novel) references music from all eras of musicology, and one scene in particular, in which Rob and his store crew (Jack Black and Todd Louiso) are referred to as music snobs, resonates beyond the film's own yearbook to a future that includes the indie kid and hipster generation.Finally, two aspects of this movie appealed to me in particular, and launched the movie into my #1 spot the art of the Top Five list and the cult of the 90s. I love Top Five lists, and if you ever have a hard time small-talking someone, just ask them to name their Top Five of anything. Most people will say they like too much stuff to rank any of it, but that's malarkey because once you say your Top Five they'll argue with at least one of your choices, meaning they do have the capacity for ranking things. This movie starts with a Top Five list, which is basically how Rob outlines the order in which he will investigate his previous love interests the Top Five Worst Breakups in His Life. As for the importance of the 90s setting, let me just clarify by saying that the 1990s are in my Top Five favorite decades list. Musically, it may be #1.The shortcomings that dropped it a couple of spots (I never give movies a 10) are nitpicky, but evident enough to limit the movie's rewatchability. One such shortcoming is the seemingly free-wheeling script given to Jack Black. Some of the things he says and does appear, well, too Jack Blackish for the movie I want to watch, and he wears thin early on as an obnoxious, abrasive, and fatuous character who wouldn't have many friends in real life (not that he does in the movie...). Katherine Zeta's lines are similarly contrived, as are a few other roles. Another pitfall is the pointless plot detour at the end of the movie when Rob is deciding about his long-term life with Laura and encounters an informed local music journalist. Sparks fly, and just as we think the movie could get 20 minutes longer, it doesn't.Although there are enough problems with this movie to bring it down a notch or two, it does include my favorite movie elements all in one feature presentation it's funny, it approaches love from the guy's perspective, it's musically themed, it includes Top Five lists, it's set in the 90s, and it takes place somewhere other than New York or California.I highly recommend seeing (and owning) this movie if you like at least two of those elements.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music"},{"date":"20 March 2013","score":"","review":" Dragon The Bruce Lee Story is directed by Rob Cohen who also co-adapts the screenplay with John Raffo and Edward Khmara. It stars Jason Scott Lee, Lauren Holly, Robert Wagner and Michael Learned. Music is by Randy Edelman and cinematography by David Eggby.Based on Bruce Lee The Man I Only Knew by Linda Lee Caldwell (Bruce Lee's widow), Dragon is more tribute movie than biography. A big success on release, it's a film that still causes some consternation with a number of Bruce Lee fans. The reasoning is because in true Hollywood style it tinkers with facts, misses out other notable points and has some time line issues. Yet if you can accept it as a painted always in a positive light homage piece more than a definitive biography? Then you find the essence of the man and his short life is there in glorious splendour.In many ways it's an inspiring tale of a complex man, while it also plays out as a wonderful love story between two people of a different race making it work at a time when such a thing was frowned upon by the ignorant. Lee's skills as an artist and a human being are firmly portrayed, with Jason Scott Lee (no relation) proving to be admirable in his depiction of such. The fights are very well choreographed and perfectly OTT, but crucially they do not come at a cost to the story, it's the narrative that shines through even as the action appeases the action hungry hoards. While rightly there's iconography unbound, naturally.The production value is high as regards quality of colour photography, set and costume design and recreations of famous moments. Edelman's score is a heart swelling and heroic scorcher that avoids over dosing on Oriental strains, Cohen moves it along at a nice clip and Holly is fabulous in her sympathetic portrayal of Bruce's wife. It's not all perfect, though. Away from the issues the hard core Lee fans have, the Demon that haunts the Lee family dreams is more funny than scary and the finale feels rushed and not dramatically fulfilling.

Their unfit mothers leave them in front of the store where Clerks begins its story. People ridicule the moms, but they go in the store anyway. After that short scene it fades into present time with a hail storm of profanity. Immediately Jason Mewes's character Jay lets out a rap with eight F bombs and 4 mother F bombs. The two go inside the store and harass the store clerk, Randal. Randal then gets a restraining order for harassment and selling drugs outside the store. Their friend Brodie tells them that the comic book Bluntman and Chronic was to become a movie. Bluntman and Chronic is based on their likeness and the boys are informed by Brodie they are entitled to some money. They go to their friend Holden McNeil to get their money, but he informs them that he gave all of his ownership to his former partner Bankey. After some research on the Bluntman and Chronic movie, Holden discovers a topic website where people are insulting Bluntman and Chronic's alter egos whose names are Jay and Silent Bob. In a furious rage of believing to be called a variety of profane names Jay and Silent Bob decide to go to Hollywood and stop the movie from being made. As they start their trip we meet many different Jay and Silent Bob go get something to eat and Jay meets the love of his life, Justice. Justice offers to give the two a ride with her friends.

His teen based movies did very well with audiences of all ages and are still hailed as some of the best movies of that decade. But then you get this movie, which by all accounts should be excellent, but when you look at the trite storyline and shallow characters you think John Hughes wrote this?Don't get me wrong, I give this movie 7\/10 because, for some reason or other, this movie, with all of its unoriginality and basically second rate story, captures your attention and you find yourself watching it over and over again. The character Watts was perhaps the only refreshing thing in the film. Her blatant disdain for her friend Keith's interest in a preppy girl isn't subtle and isn't annoying. She lets him know that she doesn't approve with her snide comments and concerns for him. I like to think it's her way of alerting her somewhat oblivious friends to her feelings for him. Mary Stuart Masterson did an impeccable job as the sexy tomboy best friend.Keith's character, although cute in his naive and unsure manner, isn't as likable as Watts; But this is masterfully done because you feel that his character shouldn't be as cool as Watts. You see in him purity of mind and heart and you know that without his best friend he wouldn't get very far in life before someone or something rocks his world, (and not in a good way.) All of these characters at first seem shallow and underdeveloped, but as you watch you realize that that is part of the movie's charm. You don't know everything about these characters because you are only glimpsing a week in the life of these kids, and they aren't spilling their guts and innermost feelings to you like in The Breakfast Club and they don't pine and long for someone they know they cannot have such as the characters in Pretty in Pink and Sixteen Candles. They try to attain what their hearts want the most, but the two go about it differently. By the end of this movie you're smiling (Not at the abrupt ending where Keith realizes who he really loves) but at the fact that you know that this here is another classic and you think, Yes, this is John Hughes.

You see in him purity of mind and heart and you know that without his best friend he wouldn't get very far in life before someone or something rocks his world, (and not in a good way.) All of these characters at first seem shallow and underdeveloped, but as you watch you realize that that is part of the movie's charm. You don't know everything about these characters because you are only glimpsing a week in the life of these kids, and they aren't spilling their guts and innermost feelings to you like in The Breakfast Club and they don't pine and long for someone they know they cannot have such as the characters in Pretty in Pink and Sixteen Candles. They try to attain what their hearts want the most, but the two go about it differently. By the end of this movie you're smiling (Not at the abrupt ending where Keith realizes who he really loves) but at the fact that you know that this here is another classic and you think, Yes, this is John Hughes.

His teen based movies did very well with audiences of all ages and are still hailed as some of the best movies of that decade. But then you get this movie, which by all accounts should be excellent, but when you look at the trite storyline and shallow characters you think John Hughes wrote this?Don't get me wrong, I give this movie 7\/10 because, for some reason or other, this movie, with all of its unoriginality and basically second rate story, captures your attention and you find yourself watching it over and over again. The character Watts was perhaps the only refreshing thing in the film. Her blatant disdain for her friend Keith's interest in a preppy girl isn't subtle and isn't annoying. She lets him know that she doesn't approve with her snide comments and concerns for him. I like to think it's her way of alerting her somewhat oblivious friends to her feelings for him.

But what actually binds them is that there has been an unusual adverse weather condition suddenly appearing in Sydney itself, which the local Aborigines seem to only know what is going to happen.David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is actually a corporate tax lawyer himself, but he would be finding himself defending four local Aborigines over a mysterious murder of one of their members which took place at a pub on the same day when the sudden adverse of weather conditions had taken place in the city. After he decides to take on the case by himself after his colleague Michael Zeadler (Peter Carroll) had dropped out, he starts to experience an unusual spate of events which would also come to affect his own family as well. But at the same time, he also feels an unusual connection with one of the four accused in Chris (David Gulpilil).It is the scene before the opening montages of seemingly ordinary and unrelated scenes of Sydney which would give an indicator of what is going to happen, of an Aborigine drawing something in a cave. It does make one wonder whether that is a sign of something major is about to happen where it seems that even if there are no more Aboriginal groups in Sydney itself, does the weather has anything to do with what their people had been expecting.There is always something about the role of water in apocalyptic scenarios, and it is present almost all the time even in the lighter moments of the film. It does make one challenge own's beliefs of the unexplainable when someone like David who looks on the surface not relating to the four Aborigines, finds himself that there is more than it meets the eye of trying to defend the four men over what was ruled as a homicide.Thrillers can take in many forms, and it need not always be of the horrifying kind. It has always been said that it is the journey and not the destination, and it shows in the film where it leaves you guessing what is going on. This film does give a look into how it seems like even in the modern world, how ancient reminders from another time are still around us even when we may not notice it with our naked eye.

When I watched this film, I imagined that it was a Doctor Who story with a decent budget. Man, if they could have made Doctor Who with amount of money, At the Earth's Core had, I would have reached Nirvana. There are in this film plenty of amazing practical effects, cheesy rubber monsters and a great cast to carry the corny script. By all means it's not the best film ever made or even the best pulp adventure film, but it's a damn entertaining one.We have two cult icons that some of you might know. Peter Cushing and Caroline *Hotter than Raquel Welch* Munro. Cushing pretty much plays Doctor Who and he steals every single scene his in. I love him as an actor and his performance keeps things lighthearted and entertaining. Caroline Munro is sexy and gorgeous in here that you are kinda disappointed that she has fairly limited screen time. Sadly, they both play supporting roles to Doug McClure who plays the leading American character. And he is really damn good in his part. He has a nice screen presence and he manages to bring enough intensity and emotion to a role which demands him to be just a white knight figure. The rest of the cast are indistinguishable slaves, rubber monsters and children of the rage from the Brood.The biggest treat aside from Caroline Munro, is the practical effects and the monsters. Those who enjoy the adventure movies from 50's and 60's will find a lot of enjoyment out it. If you happen to enjoy classic Doctor Who you will find a lot to enjoy. At the Earth's Core is a film of it's time and is very badly dated. It's fairly sexist and the overall pulpy feel and visuals might not appeal to everyone's taste. But those who like these actors and the way it's made, will plenty to enjoy.At the Earth's Core is a must see for the greatest line in movie history You cannot mesmerize me! I'm British!. If this doesn't make you to want see it then nothing can. If you are a fan of Peter Cushing, Caroline Munro and rubber monster adventure films there are plenty to enjoy.
