[{"date":"19 August 2007","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Wes Craven brings us the third and final Scream with previous cast members Neve Campbell (Scream, Wild Things, Adina), Courteney Cox (Friends, Alpha Dog), and David Arquette (Eight Legged Freaks, Riding The Bullet), with new member Parker Posey (Blade Trinity, The Sweetest Thing). Of course, Courtney Cox could be considered a new member as she is now Courtney Cox Arquette, a wedding having been performed between Scream 2 and this one.There is not as much blood and gore, as it is mostly just trying to figure our who the killer is. Courtney Cox performs as well or better than she did in Scream 2, and is still my favorite cast member. David Arquette seems to have a meatier role in this episode, while Neve Campbell comes in pretty much at the end.It wraps things up nicely. if there is a Scream 4, I would suggest bringing in Denise Richards to help things also. She and Campbelle do magical things together.
