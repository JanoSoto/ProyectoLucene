It had an interesting premise but it played out in a way that didn't click with me to anywhere near the degree that Clerks did. It was Just rather slow moving, a bit dull and as mentioned the premise was good but I didn't really take to this movie.Maybe it was the pace. It really moved quite slowly or just that I never really got that involved with these characters, they were nowhere near as compelling as the ones from Clerks, so I really had no desire to follow the story. As for the plot-I REALLY thought it was a good plot before I sat down to watch the movie but it enfolded so slowly and nothing seemed to happen a lot of the time. It was moderately interesting but not, for me, good in a classic sense.

The thing I found with 'The whole nine yards' was that when it was funny, it was hilarious and when it wasn't any where near what it should be doing (making me laugh) it was terrible. I think this should have been a more 'escapism' comedy genre like 'Rat Race' which was a free for all, out and out farce and was great but with an actor like Willis, there has to be some sort of half decent plot involved and that is one involving hit men. If you haven't turned your brain off expecting laughs all along the way, there is actually a half clever plot involving an assassination but chances are, you'll find it very confusing on first viewing at least.

The 60s were over. The elegant, ruthless James Bond played with just a bit of humor by Sean Connery, and George Lazenby's compassionate, Fleming Bond was not yet viewed as a hit with audiences. This film brought in the light-hearted, witty James Bond that would become the definitive characteristic for Roger Moore. The film brings in the new decade rathe nicely.Again, a new actor takes over from Sean Connery. Roger Moore is not the best Bond I've seen, but he isn't the worst. He gets a 3 out of 5 (Sean got a 2 out of 5, and George got a 5 out of 5). His Bond isn't like Connery's. Connery could either kiss a woman or kill a woman, and took pleasure in killing his opponents. Moore's Bond can kiss the woman but he can't kill her, and doesn't take pleasure in killing. He doesn't like it. This way of portraying James Bond is pretty effective, and probably more acceptable with the hippies in 1970. After the whiny, witty Blofeld and his homosexual wierdos as villains in Diamonds, it is refreshing to get a truly nasty and unforgiving villain in the spirit of earlier portrayls of Blofeld. Kananga is a very wicked and ingenious man. He kills those who fail him, he rules over the island with voodoo threats, and easily manipulates the people around him. Felix Lieter was the best he's ever been played. I liked the comical Sheriff J.W. Pepper. Never has a more idiotic and bumbling character been in a James Bond film. And of course, M and Moneypenny. The story is much better when compared to Diamonds, and all this gets the film 7 out of 10.However, I don't like a few things about this. They added in some optical effects to the gun barrel to show fading and rotating light by On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and it's taken out in this film. Moore's gun barrel opening is the most boring one. Q is not in this film, a major disappointment for anyone who likes 007. And again, wimpy girls. Solitare I understand; Kananga's ruled her for as long as she can remember, and this is a very trying time in her life. But even so, a little too wimpy. And if Rosie was a CIA agent, you'd expect her to be tougher. The world domination plot was what was on the DVD box, but agian, it wasn't. It was drug smuggling. The only Bond film I've watched that HAS a plot getting world domination is You Only Live Twice.Despite shortcomings, I did enjoy the reinvention of Bond. I look forward to watching the next Roger Moore film.

And since the first time I actually saw it was with my mother, and we spent a lot of the time yelping and grabbing each other's arms and blinking like crazy in sympathy, I'd call it very effective.Things I love about this film- The astonishing camera work, flying into keyholes, through the handle of a kettle, cross-sectioning walls, etc. I like to think of this as the ghost of the house - probably Mr Pearlstein looking on in bemused disgust.- The excellent, subtle performance of the girl playing Sarah, and the immediately believable relationship between her and Meg. They don't just look related, they echo one another's verbal and facial mannerisms.- The delineation of the three intruders and their differing motives - Burnham with the 'custody lawyers up his ass,' Junior out for what he can get (and do his siblings and cousins out of), Raoul because... I think Raoul was just really hoping he'd get to kill someone. I have never seen anyone deserve to get his fingers slammed in a heavy door *more*.To viewers outside America, the whole concept of a panic room is pretty alien and more than a little disturbing, so I cannot say I ever watched the movie with a feeling of 'it could happen to me,' yet I was emotionally *with* Meg and Sarah - and sometimes, despite myself, the intruders - all the way, particularly in the utterly dismaying moment when, after Meg's brave dash, the cellphone proves unusable. I'd give the film four stars out of five - it isn't one of my adored favourites, but it is a very good, solid watch that I also enjoyed on a repeat viewing. I get a little fed up with people commenting on this movie and pointing out the 'mistakes' Meg makes, like not giving the suggested signal to the police. I thought she managed extraordinarily well, and would not be half as interested in seeing a movie in which the heroine *never* made any important mistakes. It makes her a more realistic and human character, and fits in with the stubbornness, occasionally making her one-eyed, that is one of her key traits. As for people who consider it implausible that Officer Keeney should be so persistent in trying to find out if something was wrong, a) it's training, and b) when Meg brushed her hair away from her face, the fresh red burn on her hand from the propane scene was clearly visible. Now, he can't know how she got burned, but it is sufficiently at odds with her claim to be fine to make him wonder. Don't you think?

Most of my friends saw it in the theaters-- they all own the DVD now-- which is what I viewed-- and even hearing about some of the funniest sequences before I watched it, I still busted a gut! The actors are talented and well-directed-- the comedic timing in this flick is spot on! It is far better then much of the teen crap that is out there, and I defy anyone to find a movie with more laughs per minute than this one. It seems like some of the people that didn't like the movie feel that much of the humor is too broad or scatological. But hello? Is anything in this movie any grosser than a girl using human semen as hair gel (Something about Mary)or a man drinking Bull cum???(Kingpin) I don't think so. The farrelly's might have got just as ripped for their gags, but the fact remains they had huge studios behind those pictures and I think a lot of people are less apt to hop off a commercial bandwagon. Most of these reviews are from people who really love the film and who have watched it more than once, or who now own the dvd (a sign of a cult classic.) As for the knuckleheads who try to claim that this isn't as good as the 'classic' ANIMAL HOUSE-- I would suggest they go back a few decades and read the reviews of THAT film when it came out! People said many of the same things. This is definitely worth renting-- but be forewarned-- it's a very broad comedy. For those believing they're high-brow or those easily offended(mostly people who have zero sense of humor) you might not enjoy this-- but PLEASE don't try to say that Animal House or American Pie are better flicks. They are just as gross and a lot less funny. This movie even has heart. The lead characters are all endearing and it will definitely make you want to go back to school.

Of course the main problem with this new type of movie was the fact that the music would soon become outdated as times and attitudes went by. And `Flashdance' is the epitome of this doomed genre. Cheesy music, tacky clothes, big hair, fuzzy images- 80's enthusiasts only. In fact the only times in which this is actually good is when Irene Cara's Oscar winning song swoops onto the soundtrack. So, a good 90% of `Flashdance' is absolute drivel. The limp narrative bumbles along and is weaker than one would have imagined. Perhaps it would have been a better picture had it focused on the protagonist and she alone. But too much attention is put on supporting characters and their boring stories.Weak, unimaginative, thoroughly formulaic directing styles don't help matters either. To put it as bluntly as possible, there is little if anything good about this perceptibly low-budget film. The main character (Alex) isn't interesting or unusual enough to be worthy of anything more than a passive attention. Alex is nicely, though not brilliantly, portrayed by Jennifer Beals. The (then) 18-year-old actress shows talent but has completely wasted her potential on made-for TV movies ever since. Meanwhile, the unrecognisable supporting players, a who's who of `Where are they now?' are the cinematic equivalent of walking, talking clichés. I could go into depth about how mediocre they are, but I just couldn't be bothered.If you have photosensitive epilepsy, I advise you to stay away from `Flashdance'. You will either have a seizure or you won't make it out alive. One scene carries on with gratuitous strobe lighting for what seems like 10 minutes. Even if you're not an epileptic, you should stay away. Of course it eventually dances its way to a feel-good end that was semi-parodied in that Geri Halliwell music video. It leaves a good-taste, but doesn't compensate for the unforgivable dross that proceeds. A flat, shallow effort from everyone involved, the only saving grace is an above average turn from Jennifer Beals and Irene Cara's `What a Feeling'. I could go on for another while, but I'll summarise with this statement. `Flashdance' is a near dancing disaster. My IMDb rating 3.8\/10.
