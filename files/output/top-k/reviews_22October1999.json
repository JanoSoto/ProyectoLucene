Carl Sagan truly went out with a bang with this one.  I didn't know what exactly to expect from Jodie Foster's performance since I saw Nell just before I saw this - and the whole chicka-pa thing tried to invade my mind.  Nevertheless her performance was incredible and tantalizingly real.  The emotion between her and the other characters is palpable even when she doesn't speak.  She really should work with Zemeckis more often.  A previous commenter mentioned the whole running towards the mirror scene- I thought this was a bit out of place, but it was Kubrickish and I'm a big Kubrick fan.  With a plot such as this one, it's very hard to have an ending that isn't cheesy (Jody lives forever with the aliens) or disappointing (she dies or something) but this story brings about an incredible and thoughtful closure that requires a second viewing to fully understand.  Oh yeah and before I forget the CGI is just amazing.  A bit reminiscent of stargate, but incredible none the less.  You have to watch the whole sequence again to see all the minute details and stuff.  This was one of my favorite movies of all time.  The only thing that would make this movie better would be if it had Angela Bassett in it...oh wait it DOES!!!! The James Woods and Tom Skerrit characters get a bit irritating, but they are necessary to further the plot.  All in all an excellent film.  GO SEE IT SEE IT YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.

The presentation of people with problems and realistic responses to these problems and the people who are affected by these problems really makes this movie more than a past-time; it is a gift, showing us what we are and what we can become with some work and maybe a small paradigm shift.Everyone did a wonderful job of presenting real people, Sean Connery found a role which allowed him to be his age but not loose that which he is loved for sinful good looks and flawless composure. Gillian Anderson was so good that by the end I had almost stopped waiting for Molder to arrive. But for me Angelina Jolie was the centerpiece, as she showed the greatest degree of development and growth, epitomizing the struggle that each person was going through.To me, the plot was a lot more complicated than just the feelings that develop from watching the movie, and the depth of perception is honestly presented in the comments of the other reviewers; most seem to have watched the movie with so much intensity that they got up 35 minutes into it to go and tell the popcorn boy to give them a new bag because they had specifically asked for NO butter.  This movie is cognitive to the degree it is affective.  It takes one relationship and divides it up into several stages (seen as the family members' relationships), and in doing so it allows us to see relational development in ways we normally can't, just as we repeatedly see the time of day change against the buildings.It is funny, it is romantic, but it is true.

But I was also excited, because as much as I tend to shy away from  things like the Bible code, I could see great potential for a movie plot.  And I was  thrilled to see what was billed as a Christian movie playing in mainstream theatres to mainstream audiences, and with mainstream appeal.Unfortunately, I my suspicious side was more right than my excited side.The problems began with the story.  Written by two people with no previous cinematic experience, the tale jumps and skitters through a transitionless rendering of a possible interpretation of the Apocalypse of St. John.  Character develop (the few characters who are developed) with no motivation, no context, no grounding for the changes which they undergo.  Events take place with no internal support; audience members must draw from their outside knowledge and experience to understand what's going on and who's who.  But those in the audience who do have such an understanding are going to have other problems at times the movie draws more from the Book of Daniel than from Revelation, and many of the elements from Daniel which make it into the film are thought by most scholars not to reference the end-times but to reference other things, such as the destruction of the temple and the conquest of Jerusalem. Those Christians in the audience who believe in a pre-tribulation rapture will be disappointed that the rapture does not feature at all in the film.  Those Christians who believe in a post-tribulation rapture will still be disappointed, because there is no tribulation -- apart from struggling fishermen in Japan and a broken-down manufacturing plant somewhere in the world, life goes on as normal.And the goal which is proclaimed on many of the posters of the movie -- to open audiences up to the Gospel -- can only be achieved if the Gospel is actually referenced, apart from allusions to Christ.This is not to say that the story is the only problem with the movie.  The movie (which may be film, but is certainly shot, staged, and lighted as if it were a video) is directed by an inexperienced director who told most of the performers to use exaggerated stage mannerisms, as if subtlety were impossible on the big screen.  The sound and score are laughable -- over-miked, synthesized, predictable.  Most of the acting is largely mediocre.  The casting was questionable.  The editing is sloppy.  The special effects (by the folks who brought Godzilla to life) look as if they were airbrushed and applied with Q-tips.The idea of the movie had potential, and I look forward to future attempts by Christians to put legitimate work in theatres, but the folks who put this movie together needed to either consult with people who had more previous experience than they did, or else to first watch a couple of movie and see how they should turn out.

It had that snazzy-looking retro box, too, and I was in a happy mood, so I gladly went home and popped it in.This must have been the cheeriest movie I'd seen in years.  It made me think of Bringing Up Baby it was so happy (and that's a good thing, by the way). Kate Beckinsale is absolutely charming, the American guy is lots of fun, and the English guy has the great sense to be charming AND insanely cute in that odd way that the British have.  The movie has a plot, sure, but it doesn't matter.  You should just watch it and be hap-hap-happy!  Revel in the retro-kitsch set design and the goofy dialogue and that English guy's striped t-shirt.  It's the best pick-me-up since Bounty (or, you know, whatever).

Dionne Warwick.  So anyway to make a long story short, I searched (in vain) for the soundtrack for nigh on a year but to no avail.  Anyway, then one day I was at the video store (Major Video, before Blockbuster decided to buy that too) and I saw it and thought Jaysis, there's something I need to see!  It had that snazzy-looking retro box, too, and I was in a happy mood, so I gladly went home and popped it in.This must have been the cheeriest movie I'd seen in years.  It made me think of Bringing Up Baby it was so happy (and that's a good thing, by the way). Kate Beckinsale is absolutely charming, the American guy is lots of fun, and the English guy has the great sense to be charming AND insanely cute in that odd way that the British have.  The movie has a plot, sure, but it doesn't matter.  You should just watch it and be hap-hap-happy!  Revel in the retro-kitsch set design and the goofy dialogue and that English guy's striped t-shirt.  It's the best pick-me-up since Bounty (or, you know, whatever). (By the way, I warn you... after I saw it I caught myself singing that Dionne Warwick song for weeks afterwards.)
