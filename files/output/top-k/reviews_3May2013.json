And put violence and stupidity every passing minute. All in that in a movie, the answer is The Big Lebowski. The Big Lebowski not only can be one of the best films of the Coen brothers, but also as one of the funniest movies ever made. The Coens once again manage to put all his humor and intellect in a comedy written and directed as well. Everything in the movie sound Coen material, the story itself is. When the unforgettable The Dude Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is mistaken for a millionaire with the same surname Lebowski, two thugs urinate on his rug to force him to pay a debt he did not even know. Dude seeks and finds the other Lebowski (David Huddleston), not only earned a reward for the ruined rug and also accepts a job at one time as pay-off. Dude then asks the help of his bowling buddy Walter (John Goodman), a gun-toting converted to Judaism with serious anger issues. The little work leads to a huge mess which leads to more trouble, and soon seems that everyone from the porn empire tycoons and improvised criminals want something from The Dude. The whole movie is full of Coen elements. Black humor, moments of absurd violence, but it is never a negative point in the Coen films, but a great talent, especially in its big-black comedy. And as always a fantastic direction from Joel Coen (director) with amazing shots of scenes (one example is a scene where we see the bowling ball inside of it running). And the writing as always very strong in delivering extremely funny and smart dialogs. Leaving the movie extremely entertaining to watch. When the Coen duo want to make a very funny and intelligent movie, with a fantastic direction and writing. And just with a formidable cast with phenomenal performances (especially Bridges and Goodman with very entertaining and superb performances), I must say they are the best on delivery!

I'm not a big musical person, but even i found myself enjoying this movie, of course i prefer the version of the title song used in A Clockwork Orange. It's a very fun movie to watch, even though it's incredibly corny and campy. Like most films of the time, there isn't a lot of camera work that stands out. There are a few shots that stuck with me, like the dream sequence of Don Lockwood's fantasy musical, and some of the early back story scenes, but all-in-all i won't look back on this movie for the camera angles. This movie brings its A- game in its music. The score for the movie is near perfect, with varying genres and perfectly executed choreography. I almost broke my foot trying to tap dance like Gene Kelly. Unfortunately, the quality of the dancing didn't transfer to the story. The story wasn't bad, i liked it, in fact i thought it had a pretty creative concept, but i was expecting a whole lot more coming from a movie which placed 5th on AFI's top 100 movies list.

This story was so successful upon it's release that several film adaptations have been made throughout the years, but it wasn't until 1939 when the world first saw the film that is probably the most well known and admired film of forever more. The Wizard of Oz is the pinnacle motion picture of many of our childhoods, for we saw it at a very young age and it augmented our lives and points of view. Some consider it their favorite film, others consider it a icon feast, I however see it as the greatest fantasy one could embark on. This is one of the greatest tales ever told (both the movie and the original book) and every time I set my eyes upon it, I realize more and more how much I love this film and just how legendary it really is. The Wizard of Oz is THAT film, the film everyone has seen more than once and it's imagery and surroundings are very hard to rid from the mind. It's characters are relatable and very vivid to look at (Would you believe Bert Lahr's Lion costume was 90 pounds!) and the songs the characters chant are songs everyone can sing, for everyone has heard them so many times and know the lyrics by heart. But where The Wizard of Oz truly shines is in it's moral, that there is no place like home. Stated only once in Baum's original story, this quote has been the most prominent and well known movie quote ever spewed from a human mouth and it goes to show that no matter who you are and where you are, you always have a place to go to and people you can love and cherish. It's not about what kind of home it is, it's the fact that it's a home and it's a place where you can be who you want to be and relate with those most dear to you. It's the love and the warmth of being together that really matters and it's what Dorothy realizes at the very end of the film, that no matter how sepia toned her homelike is, she can be happy there and always love the things around her. That is one of the many reasons why this film is truly perfect in every sense of the word. Nah, it's not perfect, nothing is perfect, but this film is pretty darn spectacular and it's a film that will live on many, many, many, many, many years down the road, even after I am gone off the face of the Earth. This film is a tradition that generation to generation can savor and take to the heart and it's a film no one can deny, no one can get fed up with. It's the very film that gets you out of sadness and despair and into the realm of grandiose and fantastic nature.

Stanley Kubrick's unique style is on full display in this thriller that can be very graphic at times. Some scenes are twisted, some are gut wrenching, and some are outrageous. While the film is certainly not for everyone, it is fantastically different than most films ever made. Kubrick is not afraid to push the limits and refuses to follow the guidelines laid out by most movies. The uniqueness alone makes A Clockwork Orange worth watching. The star of this film is Alex DeLarge. He is a homicidal rapist and killer who assumes the role of a regular, every day student during the day. Alex and his friends deceive innocent people in order to gain access to their home. Once inside, they torture and kill the unsuspecting victims. Their scheme works on most occasions. One night however, a woman refuses to let them in. She calls the cops instead. Alex, having none of that, breaks in to her house while his friends wait outside. He murders the lady in a very graphic manner. While inside, he hears the sirens of the police on the way. In a panic, Alex quickly runs outside and meets his friends. What Alex is not counting on is that his friends turn on him. They bash him over the head and flee so that Alex is arrested and they get away easy. Alex becomes the ideal inmate while in prison. He is friendly with guards, plays by the rules, and even takes to reading the bible. As part of being the stand-up citizen in prison, he agrees to be part of an experimental type of treatment. A therapy of sorts, accomplished through a group of rehabilitation sessions. The goal of these sessions is to cure him of the violence that remains inside his mind. The curing sessions turn out to be incredibly violent. They are some of the more gruesome scenes most will ever see. One of the more unique pieces of A Clockwork Orange is the soundtrack featured during some of the violent scenes. The music is almost whimsical, certainly not fitting with what most would associate with the actions taking place. Malcolm McDowell does an excellent job portraying Alex Delarge in this film. What I liked most is the realism in his character. Despite everything he went through, in the end, Alex remains just as evil as he always was. There aren't always happy endings or feel good stories in real life. Sometimes people are sick. While normally very likable as an actor, McDowell does a great job of keeping his character dislikable in this role. He really shows few redeemable qualities. Kubrick also deserves a great deal of credit for directing McDowell in this role. It is fairly easy to follow Hollywood's tried and true path of stories that send the audience home happy. It is quite difficult to be different and to risk your career as a director to put something out there that does not fit the norm.

Fact is that my first viewing of this widely popular cult semi-classic is at least 20 years overdue and therefore I can't help thinking that my rating and impressions would presumably haven been a lot more enthusiastic if I had seen it at a more tender age. Still, even through the eyes of a skeptical and experienced 30-something genre buff, The Monster Squad nevertheless remains an enjoyable brew of horror, comedy and kids film. First and foremost the film is one giant amiable homage to Universal's classic monster cycle Dracula, Frankenstein (both 1931), The Wolf Man (1941), The Mummy (1932) and the often overlooked Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954). If I would have seen this movie when I was a lot younger, it certainly would have sparked my interest to seek out these golden oldies, and that's quite a praiseworthy accomplishment for a modestly produced 80's B-flick. And like Universal Studios themselves already attempted during the 1940's, writers Fred Dekker and Shane Black bring all these legendary horror icons together into one giant mad monster party. The plot is ludicrously simple, but effective and engaging enough. Once per century, evil masterminds have the opportunity to rule the world if &#x96; and only if &#x96; they conquer a magical amulet. Count Dracula has set his mind on this, and therefore he summons his fellow monster mates Mummy, Wolf Man, Frankenstein's Monster and the Gill Man. Our fate and salvation lies in the small hands of boys who barely even hit puberty! These horror-obsessed and rather geeky social outcasts gather in their tree house (nicely decorated with vintage old posters) and chatter about horror movies until now, in fact, they find themselves actually trapped in one. The Monster Squad is particularly fun to spot all the obvious and less obvious references to genre classics and, of course, to admire the supreme monstrous creations by Stan Winston and his collaborators. Unfortunately, and this is mainly the mature horror fanatic speaking, there are too many soft and semi-childish plot twists (like the whole friendship between the Frankenstein monster and the little sister) as well as some tedious parts. Good, solid direction by Fred Dekker. If you haven't yet, make sure to watch his debut feature Night of the Creeps, which is the total definition of 80's B-movie entertainment!

This is a film which has the good fortune to have two great talents, Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse, and the misfortune of completely wasting them. It's a film full of largely forgettable musical numbers and it has a story which never really engages and which in the end goes off the rails completely. To call the film tedious would be harsh but not entirely untrue. The film goes for laughs but fails rather miserably in that regard. It tries to give you a little romance but that angle never heats up. The film has no flow to it, there is a real disjointed feel throughout. No, this is not entertainment.Astaire plays declining movie star Tony Hunter. His friends Lester and Lily Marton have written a stage show which they think can revive his career. They bring it to noted Broadway director\/producer\/star Jeffrey Cordova who decides to turn what was written as a light comedy into a serious, and seriously bizarre, retelling of Faust. Not surprisingly this proves disastrous. Lester and Lily start bickering. The play, which no longer makes any sense whatsoever, spirals out of control. And all the while tension rises between Tony and his costar, ballerina Gabrielle Gerard. Tony is intimidated by Gabrielle's youth and beauty, not for no reason with Charisse playing the part. And he thinks this classically trained ballerina has no respect for his style of hoofing. Tony and Gabrielle have no chemistry, can't stand one another, can't work together. Eventually they do come together somewhat which provides the film with perhaps its one true highlight, Astaire and Charisse with a wonderful, beautiful dance in a park. Unfortunately after that Tony and Gabrielle's play continues to crumble and so does the film. By the time Astaire and Charisse dance together again much later on the film is past the point of being salvageable.Astaire and Charisse really were hung out to dry here. The supporting cast adds nothing. The loony Cordova character is meant to be over-the-top but Jack Buchanan goes way too far with it. This character is too nuts for the film's good. At least he has some spark to him which is more than can be said for the writing couple, Lester and Lily. Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray play those parts quite lifelessly. And James Mitchell, playing a romantic interest for Gabrielle, is a total wet blanket with all the personality of a doorknob. The musical numbers all fall flat and many make no sense whatsoever. By the end the film is just throwing random songs up on the screen to see what sticks. None of it does. Some of the numbers in the film's homestretch are obviously meant to be funny but they are just terrible, producing groans not laughs. The big final number is a little better even if, as with so much of what preceded it, it makes very little sense. The best musicals have a lot of life in them. The Band Wagon does not. The energy just is not there. The story doesn't work, the songs are forgettable, the performances of the supporting cast leave much to be desired. Astaire and Charisse have a couple of moments.

Today, on Star Wars day, I figure it only fitting to review the film that started the whole starry craze, Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress! Nah, just kidding, it's Star Wars Episode 4 A New Hope of course. It has been said countless times that Star Wars was based upon the Kurosawa samurai films as well as the Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s and 40s, but in my eyes, it's an all around fairy tale in space. Think about it, you've got the dashing, optimistic hero in Luke Skywalker, the wise, old mentor and hermit in Obi-Wan Kenobi, the damsel in distress mistress in Princess Leia, and the terrifying wizard with black attire in Darth Vader. It's like a Brothers Grimm tale or a tale written by L. Frank Baum, who you all know as the mind behind The Wizard of Oz. But what makes Star Wars great is something I can't sum up in one single review, but I'll certainly give it a try for your sake. This is 1977's Star Wars, the film that changed cinema forever. I can relate to this film on so many levels. I see a lot of myself in the characters of Luke Skywalker, C-3P0 and even the cocky Han Solo, a rebellious lad with a devil may care point of view. I can also look up to Obi-Wan Kenobi, who has become a lot like his master Qui-Gon Jinn by this episode. He has gone from a brash, outspoken padawan who viewed many creatures as useless to a wise old man who saw the potential in all creatures. I love Obi-Wan's wisdom and it's wisdom I live by every minute of everyday of my life. My favorite line of his is Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him? He has such a rich perspective of everything and his knowledge of the Force can give you the push you need to go about even the deadliest of tasks. It's his guidance that finally allows Luke to demolish the Death Star at the film's finale and it's probably something that will carry onto mentor Luke in the upcoming Star Wars Episode 7. Obi-Wan is the kind mentor we all wish we could get knowledge from so we could become wiser souls. Darth Vader is a menacing entity and is up there with the Wicked Witch of the West as one of film's greatest foes. The emotionless mask and deep dark voice of James Earl Jones really makes him ever more terrifying than he already is, but if you saw what he once was in Episodes 1,2 and 3, you tend to fear him less and less. It's hard to believe that underneath that breathing helmet is the charred face of Hayden Christensen, a once proud hero with a charming charisma. Little did we know that it would take him two more films until he finally reached his redemption and even than, it was before his untimely demise. Darth Vader is a motion picture icon, not only because of his wickedness and evilness, but because of his tragic past and his fight to gain back what he lost all those years ago. That's what makes an incredible villain, a villain that never wanted to be bad, but was thrust into badness because of one fatal decision.The other characters are also worthy of mention. Mark Hamill prevails as the adventurous, yet good hearted Luke Skywalker who would become the galaxy's most acclaimed hero towards the film's conclusion. Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia is a lot like Dorothy Gale or Alice in Lewis Carroll's classic Wonderland stories. Sure, she gets captured, but she's perfectly capable of defending herself and even defending her companions. She's a fearless woman who is not even afraid of kissing her long lost brother straight on the lips. Harrison Ford's Han Solo is probably the film's most memorable human character and with his headstrong and hipster attitude, he was what a lot of children wanted to be like when they first saw Star Wars back in 77. He's the ideal punk, but he's also the gallant hero and tough guy who's not scared to shoot down some green aliens (Who cares who shot first!) or stormtroopers. Personally, I became more fascinated with the non human characters like Chewbacca (Why didn't he get a medal!), R2-D2 and C-3P0, for like the humans, they were always trying to get the spotlight and give their share to the story. I feel like C-3PO is the most underrated character in all of Star Wars, for he is often seen as a symbol of homosexuality and annoyance. But Star Wars has a timeless story first and for most and this story gets better and better every time you experience it. Every time you experience it, you spot things you never spotted beforehand and that adds to the film's overall charm and magic. Even though it was made in the 70s, it still has the touch of a story that will last forever and never wear out. With all it's grand special effects (no matter what version of the film it is) and alien lifeforms, Star Wars is a storybook with a grand scale and a powerful, prudent moral that all creatures have a force flowing through them, allowing them to reach out and achieve the impossible.I'm not quite sure but I think that's why we love it so much.

Mark Hamill prevails as the adventurous, yet good hearted Luke Skywalker who would become the galaxy's most acclaimed hero towards the film's conclusion. Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia is a lot like Dorothy Gale or Alice in Lewis Carroll's classic Wonderland stories. Sure, she gets captured, but she's perfectly capable of defending herself and even defending her companions. She's a fearless woman who is not even afraid of kissing her long lost brother straight on the lips. Harrison Ford's Han Solo is probably the film's most memorable human character and with his headstrong and hipster attitude, he was what a lot of children wanted to be like when they first saw Star Wars back in 77. He's the ideal punk, but he's also the gallant hero and tough guy who's not scared to shoot down some green aliens (Who cares who shot first!) or stormtroopers. Personally, I became more fascinated with the non human characters like Chewbacca (Why didn't he get a medal!), R2-D2 and C-3P0, for like the humans, they were always trying to get the spotlight and give their share to the story. I feel like C-3PO is the most underrated character in all of Star Wars, for he is often seen as a symbol of homosexuality and annoyance. But Star Wars has a timeless story first and for most and this story gets better and better every time you experience it. Every time you experience it, you spot things you never spotted beforehand and that adds to the film's overall charm and magic. Even though it was made in the 70s, it still has the touch of a story that will last forever and never wear out. With all it's grand special effects (no matter what version of the film it is) and alien lifeforms, Star Wars is a storybook with a grand scale and a powerful, prudent moral that all creatures have a force flowing through them, allowing them to reach out and achieve the impossible.I'm not quite sure but I think that's why we love it so much. That's the reason I love it at least.

And I'm not just talking about the key and well-known shots as the funniest ones occur when there's barely anything on screen but Bill Murray's comic genius delivery.While I might have seen this in theatres &#x96; I was only ten when released, I don't recall.

I don't think I was alone in that appreciation of this fantastic film.Yes, the movie made a ton. Sure, it was a bona fide summer blockbuster. But, I think people just expected such quality back then, they probably had no idea how influential, how deep the lines and comedy was or the impact. For, I see dozens of summer movies over the past and recent decade or so, that are strictly made for profit. Made to be released, one after the next, while not caring it will fizzle after a couple of weeks to a month and then featured in a Redbox a couple of months later. Movies with very little heart inserted, too much CGI and less care taken.

I think this movie shows that no matter how well planned out you might think things are or how well you think you know someone you can still be caught by surprise. This film shows the planning and end stages of a diamond heist gone bad. The movie starts with all our characters having breakfast before the heist takes place. The characters are Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tiemey), and Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn). When the breakfast scene ends the film fast forward to the getaway part of the heist. All the characters are to meet at a warehouse with the diamonds but something has gone wrong and there is a rat in the mix. Someone tipped the cops off to the heist and it went bad, real bad. Mr. White and Mr. Orange are the first to make it to the warehouse. Mr. Orange is badly wounded from a shoot out with the cops. Mr. Pink soon arrives and he tells Mr. White that he thinks they were set up. They start recounting the events of the heist, discussing who was killed and who the possible rat might be. We find out in the discussion that Mr. Pink has made away with the diamonds and has them stashed. They end up pulling their guns on each other after a heated argument and accusations. Mr. Blonde then walks in to witness this. Mr. White pulls a gun on Mr. Blonde demanding to know why he killed innocent people in the heist. After the majority of the crew and Nice Guy Eddie show up at the warehouse they head out to pick up the diamonds and move some of the vehicles from the warehouse. In this mix they leave Mr. Blonde alone with a police officer they have kidnapped to get away from the heist. This is when we learn how twisted Mr. Blonde really is and which character was the rat. I think this movie was great and I have seen it many times. I love how Quentin always plays a role in his movies as well as directs. I like the Where's Waldo effect as I am always looking for him. One thing I loved about this film is the use of the flash backs. Since this film is about the before and after parts of the heist and not the heist itself the flashbacks allow for the background information on the characters. It lets you see how each of them got involved, how they got their names, which guy the boss is, and how the undercover cop got involved. The flashbacks are very well used and provide good necessary information. Another great technique used in this film is the camera angles. They allow you to receive the dramatic effect of the scenes. The end scene of the film is a perfect example because it allows you to see the pain and conflict Mr. White has with the decision he is about to make. If you like this movie I will also recommend Set It Off which is a film about a group of all women bank robbers. In conclusion this movie has it all and makes you think. What would you do for money? Would you turn on your friends or innocent people who get in your way? How well do you really know someone? No matter how well you think you know someone or who you think they are you can be surprised and this surprise could end up with deadly consequences.

He yells at her that he has the same terrible blood in his veins, and it makes him do what he does. Perkins uses Woody Woodpecker on the television interestingly, as Norman cries to his mother to stop laughing at him (which of course is Woody's iconic laugh), and it's so very evident more than ever before how his world is a mixture of reality with a heavy dose of surreal experiences; we've already known this, but for the first time it's almost spelled out in front of us, as he can't even tell the difference between his mother's laugh (one he no doubt knows all too well), and a cartoon bird on the television. There are so many little pieces like that which make Psycho III better than its low rating on here suggests. Norman finally meets someone to love in a disheartened girl who has left her convent where she was poised to become a nun by the name of Maureen; unfortunately for Norma at first, she reminds him of Marion Crane. There are two really interesting bits Perkins throws in involving Maureen. The first is when Norman sees her in the diner, and she leans down towards the floor behind the stool she sits on, but he can only picture Marion laying dead in the shower after he and mother killed her. Soon he snaps back to reality, and leaves the diner quickly. Maureen later ends up at the motel, and tries to kill herself by slitting her wrists in the bathtub. Norman is poised to kill her, all dressed up like mother again, but he finds her with her wrists open in the water, and Maureen does not see Mrs. Bates she sees the Virgin Mary holding a silver crucifix where the knife should be. One of the best moments come when Norman accidentally nudges Maureen over the stairs in his house, and she slips down over them only to fall against a statue with a sharp object protruding out of it. The statue is of Cupid, and Perkins zooms in on the arrow after it has killed Maureen, which drips blood; Cupid has literally shot her, and in a way it has also pierced Norman by taking away the only woman he ever loved. Here, Cupid shows us how everything in Norman's world is backwards; especially love.My only complaint about the film is at the very end when Norman sits in a police car being taken away, and he hauls out a little treat he was hiding to caress, as he gives a look very reminiscent to his final scene in the original Psycho. I find it a little hard to believe the police wouldn't have found this on him (I won't tell you what it is), but then again, it's a horror movie, and a certain amount of belief has to be suspended at times to properly enjoy one. Overall, it didn't ruin anything for me. 8 out of 10 stars for a great entry into the Psycho franchise. People say that Anthony Perkins tried to imitate Hitchcock in this film, but I frankly cannot see it. There's a huge difference in visual style, and a very glaring difference in storytelling. Norman is a little more slasher in this film, but why shouldn't he be? At the end of Psycho II, we are introduced to someone who could be Norman's real mother right before he kills her, so naturally the man is going to be even worse off than ever before with shocking information like that. Of course, the story is a long, winding road, and that isn't every side, but isn't a family history like Norman's bound to drive ANYONE a little mad? After all, we all go a little mad sometimes...

Norman finally meets someone to love in a disheartened girl who has left her convent where she was poised to become a nun by the name of Maureen; unfortunately for Norma at first, she reminds him of Marion Crane. There are two really interesting bits Perkins throws in involving Maureen. The first is when Norman sees her in the diner, and she leans down towards the floor behind the stool she sits on, but he can only picture Marion laying dead in the shower after he and mother killed her. Soon he snaps back to reality, and leaves the diner quickly. Maureen later ends up at the motel, and tries to kill herself by slitting her wrists in the bathtub. Norman is poised to kill her, all dressed up like mother again, but he finds her with her wrists open in the water, and Maureen does not see Mrs. Bates she sees the Virgin Mary holding a silver crucifix where the knife should be. One of the best moments come when Norman accidentally nudges Maureen over the stairs in his house, and she slips down over them only to fall against a statue with a sharp object protruding out of it. The statue is of Cupid, and Perkins zooms in on the arrow after it has killed Maureen, which drips blood; Cupid has literally shot her, and in a way it has also pierced Norman by taking away the only woman he ever loved. Here, Cupid shows us how everything in Norman's world is backwards; especially love.My only complaint about the film is at the very end when Norman sits in a police car being taken away, and he hauls out a little treat he was hiding to caress, as he gives a look very reminiscent to his final scene in the original Psycho. I find it a little hard to believe the police wouldn't have found this on him (I won't tell you what it is), but then again, it's a horror movie, and a certain amount of belief has to be suspended at times to properly enjoy one. Overall, it didn't ruin anything for me. 8 out of 10 stars for a great entry into the Psycho franchise. People say that Anthony Perkins tried to imitate Hitchcock in this film, but I frankly cannot see it. There's a huge difference in visual style, and a very glaring difference in storytelling. Norman is a little more slasher in this film, but why shouldn't he be? At the end of Psycho II, we are introduced to someone who could be Norman's real mother right before he kills her, so naturally the man is going to be even worse off than ever before with shocking information like that. Of course, the story is a long, winding road, and that isn't every side, but isn't a family history like Norman's bound to drive ANYONE a little mad? After all, we all go a little mad sometimes...

I don't think there were many animated films in the 1970's that were even Rated R. If you are a person with Epilepsy this not the movie for you. This movie is pretty trippy.This movie deals with a lot of heavy topics such as racism and drug use. There is one scene with Nazi's in it. There is scene where the black people are suppose to be crows and they do use the N word at least 2-3 times. They even have a scene where the 6 letter f-word is mentioned. There are some sex jokes in this movie. If you don't like crude humor you probably won't like this movie.I thought this was a pretty good movie. I liked many of the scenes in the movie. One my favorites was the one where Fritz is the pawn shop and trying to sell a used toilet. He tries to explain how it belonged to and old person and was only gently used.

In this film we find ourselves following our main character King Arthur (Graham Chapman) as he gathers his knights of the round table to embark on a quest to find the Holy Grail. The actors in this film defiantly DO NOT live up to any historical depiction of any king or knight that may have ever existed, but this is what we have come to love and expect out of the Monty Python crew. The style and theme of this film can only be described as cheap in the best sort of way. One would assume that in medieval times travel would mostly be done on horses, well Monty Python does not disappoint. No expense was speared when collecting the coconuts used to produce hoof sounds throughout the movie. That's right there are no horses in this movie, just men acting as if they were on horses while another man follows them around with coconuts. In conclusion I would have to say that following these men around on their adventure is definitely time well spent. I'll be watching this movie over and over, and will be getting just as much enjoyment out of it the hundredth time as I did the first.
