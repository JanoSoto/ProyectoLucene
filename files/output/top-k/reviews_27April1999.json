It was unbearably boring!!! Nothing worked. Good actors were creating realistic and sometimes funny characters, the plot line was moving along, Glenn Close was in her Cruella De Vil mode and shining. Nothing went wrong, except that it was unbelievably slow, predictable, illogical, syrupy, and, from time to time, plain stupid.  All comedic elements were overused and beaten to death.

First of all, I was not familiar with the TV series, so I don't have a history to compare it with like I did with, say, THE AVENGERS.  This is not to say I avoided seeing it, it just was never in syndication where I happened to live, or if it was, I just never noticed it.  On vacation one time, I did happen to catch a few episodes, but nothing stuck with me, except, of course, the catchphrases like Good morning, Mr. Phelps, Your mission, should you choose to accept it... and This message will self-destruct in five seconds.  So those who said the movie suffered when compared to the show may very well be right, I just don't know.As for those who complained it was too confusing; with all due respect, you need to get out more.  I knew who the bad guy was within the first half hour, and so all you have to do is wait for the rest of the people to figure it out.Okay, now that I got all that out of the way; having seen this again on TV recently, first time since I saw it in the theater, I can confirm once again this is slick but still entertaining.  The main problem, as one critic said up here, is that this is neither an actor's movie nor a director's movie, but a story movie, and the story doesn't allow a lot of room for either the actors or the director to move.  You've got some good names here, but the only one with a character to play is Vanessa Redgrave, and she plays it beautifully(though Ving Rhames has some moments).  Especially lost is Emmanuelle Beart, a great actress and the most beautiful actress in movies today, but she's all wrong for the part here.  And though Brian DePalma stages some good scenes(especially, of course, the scene where Tom Cruise breaks into the computer room), he seems a little hamstrung by the plot. Maybe John Woo will do more with the sequel, I don't know.  Still, it is entertaining enough.  At least it wasn't like THE UNTOUCHABLES, which one critic aptly described as a beautifully wrapped package with nothing inside.

Well, this movie is certainly bigger than any of the Japanese Godzilla movies in terms of budget and special effects. But is it better? Well, it all depends on your point of view, I suppose....The good news is that this is a really fun and entertaining movie. Even knowing most of the plot ahead of time, it kept me on the edge of my seat. It was fast-paced, witty, exhilarating, and just plain fun! The special effects were awesome, and the CGI scenes were integrated well enough with the live footage so that it was easy to suspend disbelief and accept the thought of a gigantic monster rampaging in New York City. No, none of the actors are going to win Oscars for their performances, and the script probably won't be considered one of the classics of Western literature, but who really cares? This is a giant monster movie, and this movie certainly delivers a fantastic giant monster! Everything else is incidental. I mean, the more time they spend on character development, the less time they can spend showing the monster destroying New York, right? So, as giant monster movies go, this one is definitely a four star movie. Well, at least three and a half....But is it truly a Godzilla movie, or is it simply a great monster movie?Basically, this movie is a retelling of the original Godzilla movie, starting anew as if none of the previous Godzilla movies has ever taken place. This allows the film makers to play fast and loose with the character, without having to worry about monkeying around with the existing Godzilla continuity. Toho did something similar to this in 1984 when they deleted all the previous movies except for the first one. This is definitely an American movie, though -- Godzilla attacks New York, not Tokyo, and there is no connection to the atom bombing of Japan which served as the moral compass of the first movie. The important question, then, is whether this is really a Godzilla movie in anything other than name only.Well, it is about a gigantic mutated reptile that attacks a  major metropolitan area. And he does have these really funky spines running down his back. And, unlike movies like The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and The Giant Gila Monster, this new monster does walk on two legs just like the traditional Godzilla. And this new monster does have a breath weapon of sorts, although instead of the traditional atomic plamsa breath we get a strong wind and a major case of halitosis. So, if Godzilla is simply a giant reptile that was created by radiation, has spines on his back, walks on two legs, breathes something destructive from his mouth and destroys cities, then yes, this probably is a Godzilla movie, in spite of the fact that this Godzilla also burrows underground and lays eggs.Is this all Godzilla is, though? Personally, I think not. Although this movie preserves the basic concept of a giant monster attacking a city, that basic concept has been used in countless other movies. The original Godzilla was portrayed as an unstoppable force of nature, whereas this monster is simply a giant animal trying to get along in the world. The original Godzilla was an allegory for the horrors of nuclear war visited upon Japan, whereas this monster doesn't seem to be much of an allegory of anything. And, most important of all in my opinion, the original Godzilla had a powerful weapon that made him truly terrifying, his fearsome atomic plasma breath. That's what made him uniquely different from every other monster, and it was a clear, visual representation of his atomic-spawned origin. Monster, on the other hand, is able to blow hard enough to knock cars over, but it's just not the same. The film does pay homage to the traditional breath weapon by having vehicles ignite in mid-air, making it look briefly as if Godzilla is breathing fire, but that's as close as they come. Apparently, a fire-breathing 200-foot tall radioactive iguana would just be too hard to believe.... Unfortunately, Godzilla without his flame breath is like Batman without his batmobile, batcave and batarangs. Or perhaps a better analogy would be Superman without his ability to fly. Flying may not be realistic, but it is an essential part of the character....So, what's the final verdict? It's a fun movie. Go see it. Enjoy it. See it again. Check your higher reasoning functions at the door and just think about how lucky you are to have finally seen a giant monster movie done with such great special effects.And then, when you're done, go pop Godzilla King of the Monsters into the old VCR and remind yourself what Godzilla is really all about....

This love hate relationship is very common on the American cinema. I do not know if that works in reality. But this is a love portrait in the movies! The dialogue is witty.Michelle Pfeiffer (Up Close and Personal, Frankie and Johnny (1991)) plays an architect who is a single parent. She is very vivacious in this part. There is a chemistry between her and George Clooney (ER, Batman & Robin (1997), The Thin Red Line). I thought that Clooney was good for the part because we watch ER all the time and he was very believable as Jack Taylor. I liked Jack Taylor more than I did Melanie Parker, their characters.The kids are adorable. Mae Whitman already played in Hope Floats another Obst production. Alex D. Linz ( Home Alone 3) Sammy,  is now a mega star in the kid's movies. They are both adorable! Obst seems to like those plots where the mom has the dilemma between kids and their careers. Nothing wrong with that since this is a very common thing in our society where most women do have to work full time and juggle all that. And yes, many are divorced. That is a reflection of our society.My favorite scenes  kids talking are always funny, Parker's  mother in the SPA when they switched cell phones, the Hispanic maid (too much of stereotypes, but still funny) who cannot understand English in an emergency then arguing which boat to take, Jack Taylor picking up Melanie Parker and carrying her when the ground is wet, and the kids match making. The psychiatric scene the fish, and the girl picked up every line. This is a cool movie.  It is fun and I recommend it.

'Happiness' sparkles with comedy, yet there is a constant sickening thud as scene after scene revels in the grossest, blackest examples of human behaviour.The packed audience on the night I went was frequently in hysterics at the tactlessness and hopelessness of the characters (so much so that I'm going to have to go back to catch all the jokes I missed because of the laughter). As the film developed, however, a chill crept slowly over people, and the crucial sequence between Dylan Baker and his son was met in gripped silence (apart from a couple of idiots in front of me, who found the whole thing hilarious - though perhaps they were laughing as a nervous reaction).Solondz's triumph lies in his audacity. So often I found myself catching my breath, gasping in horror at what he had put on film, but managing at the same time to express admiration that he had done it so skilfully. To be able to make a paedophile a subject of humour successfully, and to make him a sympathetic character at the same time, is an achievement so profound I cannot express my awe. It is only sad that Dylan Baker, who deserved a Best Supporting Actor Oscar more than any of the nominees, was denied a place in the Hall of Fame, presumably precisely because of the nature of his role.Attention naturally focuses on Baker, but the other cast members are perfection, especially Hoffman and Adams (a real find - where did she spring up from?). Nobody in this film is likeable - yet we recognise ourselves in their frailty, and cannot help rooting for them.I give it 9 rather than 10 out of 10, because it has a few faults Solondz could have trimmed 10-15 minutes off it (he has a tendency to linger at the end of sequences); the story of the divorcing parents never really goes anywhere, where it could have been the most interesting; and the revelation of Hoffman's overweight neighbour strikes a false note - the only time when Solondz goes a little too much OTT.But, overall, I salute Todd Solondz for courage, wit, intelligence and humanity.

It is probably the best movie ever made about city paranoia.  I really love the tag team of Robert DeNiro and Martin Scorsese.  If you add that to a completely mind-blowing screen play by Paul Schrader you got yourself a movie that you cannot forget about when you leave the theater.

But unfortunately there's a bunch of nonsense about a female photographer inexperienced in the African wild, played with great emptiness by Elsa Martinelli. She's a twig of a lady and not as nearly as interesting as Michele Girardon, whose character has been around animals since she was a baby. There are a bunch of other guys, too, most of them there to act silently and toughly and to swarm around the two girls. There's also Red Buttons, who at times can be genuinely funny, and then at others the film cuts to him at an awkward moment so he can spout off a one-liner that's equally awkward. Even though the movie was apparently shot in Africa, the character development scenes manage to look like any old Hollywood soundstage. In previous Howard Hawks films, the parts that were the most fun were the dialogue scenes. And the more people talking the better. But Hatari! grinds to a halt every time they decide to move the characters' stories forward. Hawks doesn't blend the characters and the action, he makes them take turns. Who cares about these people?

The first, about a coven of sexual witches, seems more like a naughty 1940s cartoon, and it seems Anders was thinking more of a pornographic Looney Tunes Episode when she wrote this one. The next segment, The Wrong Man, was simply disappointing. A maniacal man named Siegfried ties up his wife, holds Ted the Bellboy as a hostage, and then bounces around, not making much sense. When it was over, I wasn't sure what exactly had happened -- was it actually just all a game? Did someone really sleep with Siegfried's wife or what? And hearing so many names for the male penis... Frankly, I could have heard that at a high school. Not what I call entertaining. After that, there was The Misbehavers, where Ted has to babysit a Mexican gangster's pair of children. I sort of liked this one, because it was so absurd, and the ending -- while it might seem a little cliche -- still brings forth an earnest chuckle. Robert Rodriguez, if he had tried a little harder, could have saved the Four Rooms ship from completely sinking, but he only manages to keep it afloat a little longer. Tarantino's efforts are a little more shoddy. It's classic Tarantino, and it seems like a scene from a Tarantino movie. But the previous four segments have just ruined your viewing capability, and ruined it all for Tarantino as well. His take on The Man From Rio is downright cool, and his minute to convince is excellent. But it isn't brilliant, and so Four Rooms remains destined to fall to the bottom of movie history.

There are also a lot of jokes in it that you MIGHT miss if you are not a horror regular......but then you might not. All in all I think that this is a fantastic film whether you look at it as a genuine horror film or a mystery\/thriller\/suspense type of film, and much more satisfying than the sequel.
