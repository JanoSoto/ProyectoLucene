However, by the time I saw it I was already well-directed in my own life. I had a pretty good idea where I was going. No, for me, the impact came much differently.I've skimmed about 80 of the 290 reviews on here and have only found the love story subplot mentioned twice, wherein it was simply referred to as being worthless or useless in the story.

If I remember, the room where I watched the movie had the lights out, but all someone would have had to do was look in my direction to see the bright red glow on my face. On the screen, everything seemed to speak to me personally and my own life. At the time I still hoped things between me and my Dorothy could work out.

While I can't downplay the importance of following your dream and achieving your goals, of research and study and sticking with something that's important; while October Sky was a meal on my journey that has helped motivate me to reach my own dreams in writing and doing some of the most important things in my own life, I can't deny that the more important place it held for me was offering me a strange and sad look at a girl that I loved.So, while some of you will undoubtedly continue to call the minor love story trite, cliché, not crucial to the main drama, etc, from my own perspective I would call your attention to the likely fact that Homer H.

While it is a pretty low-key film and definitely not what you'd call a blockbuster, it was so loved in Sweden that it stayed in cinemas for over 10 years! So why was this film considered so great? Well, for starters, this is Jack Nicholson at his very best, and that says a lot. Throughout his long and successful career, this might still be Jack's best performance (although I'd argue that his scorching scenery-chewing in The Shining is even more entertaining). The movie is worth seeing for Mr. Nicholson alone. His high energy, quietly sardonic delivery and trademark leer is pure comic gold and McMurphy is a movie legend.The supporting cast is excellent, as well the petrifying Louise Fletcher, whose demanding screen presence almost steals the scene from Nicholson himself; Brad Dourif in the role of a life-time as the troubled teen Billy Bibbit; Danny DeVito and Scatman Crothers as one of the inmates and the warden, respectively; and even Christopher Lloyd in his smashing debut role. One-hit-wonder Will Sampson makes a great Chief Bromden, and Sydney Lassick, one of my favourite no-name actors, is hilarious as poor Cheswick who just wants his cigarettes.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is such a massive success because it balances between emotions so perfectly. To keep it simple the movie is hilarious, sweet, touching and ultimately shattering. The climax is fantastic and will stick in your memory for a long time. Since the movie's basic plot is very simple (wrongfully institutionalized man teaches suppressed inmates at a mental hospital how to have fun) director Milos Forman can effectively play on our emotions without either manipulating or condescending us. There are no musical or visual cues that tell us what to feel, there are no wailing violins when something bad happens. Instead, the performances and story are more than enough to affect us.Milos Forman, who also cranked out several other of my favourite movies (including Amadeus, Hair and The People vs. Larry Flynt) is probably the one to thank for making this movie as impressionable as it is. There are no unnecessary scenes, no pointless fluff, no cringe-worthy moments in the film. Every scene is needed to move the plot along, to make us laugh, to make us cry. No scene feels like it could have been left on the editing room floor because every part of the film is just so damn good. Forman is one of today's most under-appreciated directors in my opinion. The guy's a genius, and this is by far his best movie.Having read the book which the film was based on, I understand why fans were disappointed by some of the changes Forman made. The novel is a brilliant masterpiece and one of the most affecting books I have ever read. Still, I don't think the differences between the book and the movie somehow make the latter worse. The most obvious change in the film version is, of course, the fact that we no longer see the story from Chief Bromden's perspective, as we do in the novel. I don't think this change was unnecessary at all and it works very well. It even adds a slight plot twist to the story for someone who hasn't read the book, but let's not say too much about that. I know how much it sucks when someone ruins the plot twist for you. *cough*The Sixth Sense*cough* (Anyway, where was I? Despite some changes in the story, any film fan will see that this is an excellent piece of work, a perfect film to just sit back and enjoy. The script is brilliantly written and the delivery from the cast could not have been better. Overall, a great film if you want to laugh, cry, gasp in horror and just become ensnared in a simple and extremely powerful story. Is Jack's character crazy or not? In my opinion, definitely not. Well, no crazier than the average a**hole walking around on the street. He just got sent to the mental hospital, as he put it himself, because he fights and f**ks too much. Still it's interesting to see how far a man like McMurphy will go to get away from work, and how the other inmates - the true psychos - react to his extrovert and completely over-the-top persona. The inmates' transformation from quietly respectful and pathetically obedient patients to real people is brilliant. Louise Fletcher remains the same vile, quietly life-destroying nurse throughout, and in the end we cheer for McMurphy when he finally takes the law into his own hands. Fletcher is frighteningly great in her role and handing her the Best Leading Actress Oscar was one of the few smart things that the Academy ever did. A total class act and one of cinema's most memorable character studies. It's a shame her career didn't go the same way as Nicholson's - perhaps she was so overshadowed by the latter's manic performance, no one truly saw how amazing her work here really was.Simply one of the greatest movies ever made.

Superficially I should. I'm fascinated by films that are about films or something like them manufactured illusion. And its especially nice when characters wonder about where they belong, which layer of reality is true, what it means to be fabricated and how to jump levels. Its all about lucidity.But I'm interested in this because I'm interested in tricks that storytellers can use to make their stories more engaging. So its important to me that when these devices are used, they are used to fold the audience into the story. For instance, a simple fold is when we have an on- screen audience that our characters perform to.Its all a much grander and richer notion than self-reference or reflexivity.

Basically, that was about it, action-wise, BUT I have no complaints because the more I watch this film, the more I like it.

A generation back, movie makers tended to build up characters and suspense, so there was a lot more storytelling and less action than you see today. Also, this movie doesn't have the shock value today for audiences, either, not after years of Freddie Krueger-type blood-and-guts seen in the past 30 years.But, what you WILL see in this movie is (1) superb acting; (2) a fascinating lead character; (3) excellent photography, and (4) a bizarre story.Norman Bates is one of the most famous fictional names in film history, thanks to this film and the great work portraying him by Anthony Perkins. Norman is a nutcase, as it turns out and the more you know all about him, the more fun it is to study Perkins and his character Norman in subsequent viewings. He really has the guy down pat. However, it isn't just Perkins' film; the supporting is just fine with Leigh, whose figure is still awesome no matter how many times you see it; Martin Balsam as the private detective; Vera Miles and John Gavin.

Artificial Intelligence. Directed and written by Steven Spielberg, it was a project he inherited from the late, great Stanley Kubrick, who had been toying with it for, reportedly, nearly two decades before his death. Spielberg picked up the torch of the project and managed to do what eluded Kubrick Actually make the movie. Upon first viewing in 2001, I was very impressed by A.I., and recently seeing it again, I still think it is an underrated piece in Spielberg's canon, but not without flaws. When A.I. works, it works marvelously, but occasionally gets a bit bogged down.A.I. opens in some future setting, when the polar ice caps have melted and the coastal cities of the world have been engulfed by water. The human society has begun to rely on robots, known in society as Meccha for many tasks, and now Professor Hobby (William Hurt), the head of Cybertronics, has devised the next step in Meccha evolution to create a child robot that can love. He finds the perfect test case a father, Henry (Sam Robards) and mother, Monica (Frances O'Connor) whose son has been placed in cryogenic stasis to prevent a disease and the doctor's are uncertain if he will ever recover. Henry is employed by Cybertronics, so Professor Hobby arranges for him to bring home David (Haley Joel Osment), the robot child. David is at first met with resistance from Monica, who is offended that they are expected to let David replace their child, but she begins warming to him shortly. She eventually imprints David to her, but when their own child recovers and is brought back into the house, David, who is having difficulty acclimating himself to life with real people, is viewed as a threat by Henry and he eventually convinces Monica that he must be returned to Cybertronics to be destroyed.Monica is unable to go through with it, though, and she leaves David and a walking, talking stuffed bear companion, Teddy, alone in the forest. David is desperate to be reunited with Monica, but finds himself captured by humans who torture robots for sport at what is known as a Flesh Fair. There David bonds with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) a robot who is designed to be a sexual companion to women, and the two seek out help for David to find a way to be human so that Monica will love him. There are a lot of interesting themes in A.I., including the idea that even with a human face, man will still treat machines as machines, even when their programming brings them enormously close to sentience; a mediation on the nature of love, and the question of when a machine has a soul or not. Many of these issues revolve around David, the focal point of the film, who finds himself trapped with emotions for Monica but is separated for reasons that he cannot completely understand. Gigolo Joe thinks of love merely as sexual acts, but David's love goes deeper, and he is desperate to have it fulfilled. The film's early scenes, with David and Monica together in the household and becoming used to each other, are good, and the late section of the film, as David reaches the end of his journey, are also strong, but the middle section is where the film loses some steam. The scenes in the flesh fair and at the visually stunning Rouge City, where David and Joe go searching information, are momentum killing and introduce a lot of ideas that don't really get resolved. Spielberg is trying to say everything he can on these issues, but by distracting from the core of the story, the narrative gets a little lost and A.I. can prove a bit tedious in those moments. There has been a great deal of criticism leveled at the film's final thirty or so minutes, but these work for me. Many have accused the film of becoming too cute and sweet, but it is the emotional payoff for the earlier part of the film that is hardly the completely happy ending that it has been identified as. It isn't as harsh as it would have been if the film had ended a bit earlier, but it's hardly a panacea, and works just fine.A.I. does excel in many areas, including its look and visual effects. The film is a bit more futuristic looking than the film that Spielberg would follow it with, Minority Report, but it is still credible. The visual effects creating the future environments are top notch, with immense realism. A.I. also boasts strong performances from its leads, especially Osment. He was impressive in The Sixth Sense, but here he takes the cake and it's unfortunate that he seems to have put his acting career on hold to seek out other areas of interest. Frances O'Connor is equally impressive as Monica. Jude Law is good also, but doesn't have a lot to do, unfortunately.A.I. is an example of a film that reaches for greatness, falls a little short by having too grand a vision, but still manages to be engaging nonetheless. It is one of the more unique films from Steven Spielberg and worth a look.

Directed and written by Steven Spielberg, it was a project he inherited from the late, great Stanley Kubrick, who had been toying with it for, reportedly, nearly two decades before his death. Spielberg picked up the torch of the project and managed to do what eluded Kubrick Actually make the movie. Upon first viewing in 2001, I was very impressed by A.I., and recently seeing it again, I still think it is an underrated piece in Spielberg's canon, but not without flaws. When A.I. works, it works marvelously, but occasionally gets a bit bogged down.A.I. opens in some future setting, when the polar ice caps have melted and the coastal cities of the world have been engulfed by water. The human society has begun to rely on robots, known in society as Meccha for many tasks, and now Professor Hobby (William Hurt), the head of Cybertronics, has devised the next step in Meccha evolution to create a child robot that can love. He finds the perfect test case a father, Henry (Sam Robards) and mother, Monica (Frances O'Connor) whose son has been placed in cryogenic stasis to prevent a disease and the doctor's are uncertain if he will ever recover. Henry is employed by Cybertronics, so Professor Hobby arranges for him to bring home David (Haley Joel Osment), the robot child. David is at first met with resistance from Monica, who is offended that they are expected to let David replace their child, but she begins warming to him shortly. She eventually imprints David to her, but when their own child recovers and is brought back into the house, David, who is having difficulty acclimating himself to life with real people, is viewed as a threat by Henry and he eventually convinces Monica that he must be returned to Cybertronics to be destroyed.Monica is unable to go through with it, though, and she leaves David and a walking, talking stuffed bear companion, Teddy, alone in the forest. David is desperate to be reunited with Monica, but finds himself captured by humans who torture robots for sport at what is known as a Flesh Fair. There David bonds with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) a robot who is designed to be a sexual companion to women, and the two seek out help for David to find a way to be human so that Monica will love him. There are a lot of interesting themes in A.I., including the idea that even with a human face, man will still treat machines as machines, even when their programming brings them enormously close to sentience; a mediation on the nature of love, and the question of when a machine has a soul or not. Many of these issues revolve around David, the focal point of the film, who finds himself trapped with emotions for Monica but is separated for reasons that he cannot completely understand. Gigolo Joe thinks of love merely as sexual acts, but David's love goes deeper, and he is desperate to have it fulfilled. The film's early scenes, with David and Monica together in the household and becoming used to each other, are good, and the late section of the film, as David reaches the end of his journey, are also strong, but the middle section is where the film loses some steam. The scenes in the flesh fair and at the visually stunning Rouge City, where David and Joe go searching information, are momentum killing and introduce a lot of ideas that don't really get resolved. Spielberg is trying to say everything he can on these issues, but by distracting from the core of the story, the narrative gets a little lost and A.I. can prove a bit tedious in those moments. There has been a great deal of criticism leveled at the film's final thirty or so minutes, but these work for me. Many have accused the film of becoming too cute and sweet, but it is the emotional payoff for the earlier part of the film that is hardly the completely happy ending that it has been identified as. It isn't as harsh as it would have been if the film had ended a bit earlier, but it's hardly a panacea, and works just fine.A.I. does excel in many areas, including its look and visual effects. The film is a bit more futuristic looking than the film that Spielberg would follow it with, Minority Report, but it is still credible. The visual effects creating the future environments are top notch, with immense realism. A.I. also boasts strong performances from its leads, especially Osment. He was impressive in The Sixth Sense, but here he takes the cake and it's unfortunate that he seems to have put his acting career on hold to seek out other areas of interest. Frances O'Connor is equally impressive as Monica. Jude Law is good also, but doesn't have a lot to do, unfortunately.A.I. is an example of a film that reaches for greatness, falls a little short by having too grand a vision, but still manages to be engaging nonetheless. It is one of the more unique films from Steven Spielberg and worth a look.

They are staring up at the stars one night when they see a meteor flash across the sky and slam into the ground a few miles away. The next day they use a local pilot to find the crash site and John goes down into the crater. He manages to escape the crater just as a rock slide brings the whole pit crashing down into itself however he is convinced he has seen some form of alien craft down there. Quick to jump to conclusions about it, John finds nobody believes him and he is dismissed as concussed at best or crazy at worst. He is mocked in the press and by the military but while he is, something is alive in the desert with motives that are unknown to anyone on Earth.Although it does have weaknesses and limitations in common with other entries in the genre from the time, this piece of sci-fi is well worth a look for many reasons. The motives for the alien arrival on Earth is unclear for most of the film and you are not sure what to think for the majority of the film. The most obvious assumption is that the alien has come to turn mankind in wooden and stiff b-movie actors (for indeed this is what it does) but there is more to it and, although it won't set the world on fire, it is more interesting than many films that simply bring enemies down. What makes it work as well is the solid delivery from start to finish. The eerie cinematography works well with the score to produce a constant air of something being out there and it does produce a tangible tension across the movie that is more that waiting for the creature to be shown. In fact the alien being shown so early in the film is one of the weaknesses as it would have been much better to build to a restrained appearance later in the film (particularly since their appearance is made out as so horrifying). That said it does hold back after this and it is the eye view of the camera that shows the alien presence, but it is the fear of them being all around that produces the best tension, particularly since we cannot be sure of what they are up to.Apparently released in 3D (but not the version I saw) the film looks creepy without it and the dead desert is well used as a place holding danger and secrets. The cast work well with the script which mostly avoids cliché and even produces some nice flows of dialogue. Carlson makes for a convincing lading man who is not a square-jawed hero type but much closer to a real person. Rush is cute and has a good chemistry with Carlson that makes her more than just a screaming sidekick. Drake is enjoyably tough and brings out tension well with his fear crossed with aggression. The way the alien people are so stiff and wooden was a bit of a problem for me since it was so obvious that something was wrong with them &#150; it would have been better to have had them only a few steps removed from the people whose form they have taken.No matter though, this is still a good sci-fi from the period. The narrative is solid but it is the delivery that makes it with a eerie score, good cinematography and surprisingly (for the genre\/period) good performances. The 3D thing is a gimmick that tends to be discussed more than the film but without it this is still a great little piece of sci-fi from the 50's.

That said it does hold back after this and it is the eye view of the camera that shows the alien presence, but it is the fear of them being all around that produces the best tension, particularly since we cannot be sure of what they are up to.Apparently released in 3D (but not the version I saw) the film looks creepy without it and the dead desert is well used as a place holding danger and secrets. The cast work well with the script which mostly avoids cliché and even produces some nice flows of dialogue. Carlson makes for a convincing lading man who is not a square-jawed hero type but much closer to a real person. Rush is cute and has a good chemistry with Carlson that makes her more than just a screaming sidekick. Drake is enjoyably tough and brings out tension well with his fear crossed with aggression. The way the alien people are so stiff and wooden was a bit of a problem for me since it was so obvious that something was wrong with them &#150; it would have been better to have had them only a few steps removed from the people whose form they have taken.No matter though, this is still a good sci-fi from the period. The narrative is solid but it is the delivery that makes it with a eerie score, good cinematography and surprisingly (for the genre\/period) good performances. The 3D thing is a gimmick that tends to be discussed more than the film but without it this is still a great little piece of sci-fi from the 50's.

Their lives are an unpredictable mix of actions that mostly involve drinking and scamming round on the fringe of society. When Eddie is away for a few days, Marueen falls in drinking with neighbour Kiefer, who tries to rape her but then just beats her. She explains this away to Eddie so as to keep him from going crazy at her or anyone else but when he does start to flip she calls the paramedics to take him into care for his own safety. However when he shoots one of them, Eddie is sentenced to a mental institution. When he comes out he finds that Maureen has divorced him and has moved onto a much more stable and reliable man in the form of Joey, with whom she has had more children.Almost halfway in it becomes evident that this film isn't going to work out that well because, before the 10 years later jump, the love between the two leads hasn't been established to a convincing degree. Given that the narrative is using this mutual attraction (despite all the negatives) as its lynchpin this is a bit of a problem. Other than establishing that both are unstable and using each other for meaning, the film doesn't do that much for all the time it takes up. The second half isn't that much better as Eddie comes out as a sort of watered down Rainman and disrupts Maureen's new relationship with Joey. The script then asks us to swallow that she still loves Eddie to the point where the mere news that he is released sees her flush the last ten years down the toilet.I can sort of understand what the script was trying to do but it didn't manage to produce anything interest in the aggressive relationships that it paints in the gutter. The characters are where the main failing is. Maureen's character is poorly defined and Wright-Penn doesn't appear to understand what motivates her character and thus turns in a really mixed performance that pushes emotional buttons in each scene but is never consistent. Eddie is OK in the first half of the film as he just seems like a drunk unstable loser but in the second half he is unconvincingly soft. Likewise Penn is strong in the first half but he is unconvincing in the second. Their performances aren't helped by a weird mix of tones &#150; at times a dark love story, at other times a cringingly awful comedy complete with jaunty music being played over a fight on the front lawn or that horrible scene at Joey's bar. Travolta is a bit better and Stanton is a reasonably nice addition in a small role.Overall this is a shocking mess of a film that spirals downhill from the mid-point onwards. The first half shows potential but doesn't manage to pull off the formative stages of the central relationship and thus fails to set up the second half. However the second half isn't helped by poor development and a terrible mishmash of comic moments that simply feel crass and out of place &#150; I suspect even if the first half had been a stormer, this second half would have been poor enough to drag it all under. Even the acting talent seems all at sea and unsure of where they stand or who they are. A load of rubbish with little or no value.

For the latter two films, it was my first opportunity ever to view both, and it made for a wonderfully entertaining day. Basil Rathbone appears as the titled Son of Dr. Henry Frankenstein, the Colin Clive role in the first two films. In perhaps an odd coincidence, reference is made in the story to Scotland Yard relative to six murders; in his very next film, The Hound of the Baskervilles, Rathbone would begin a hugely successful run as detective Sherlock Holmes.There are a number of departures from the earlier movies, the main one being Boris Karloff's entirely differentiated attire from the 'classic' look of the Frankenstein monster. Here he's wearing an out of character (at least for me) sheepskin type vest, reduced to the guttural grunting of the first film, whereas he was learning to speak in the interim film Bride. While Dr. Henry Frankenstein's assistants in the first two movies were named Fritz and Karl (both portrayed by Dwight Frye), this is the one in which we're introduced to the familiar 'Ygor' sidekick, masterfully played by Bela Lugosi.Now if the appearance of Rathbone, Karloff and Lugosi weren't enough, this film adds Lionel Atwill in a role that's almost a caricature, that of police Inspector Krogh. Perhaps I've been contaminated by the Kenneth Mars role in Young Frankenstein, but if I had never seen this film, I would have believed Mel Brooks made up the whole dart scene in his screen send up. Instead, when Krogh rams all those darts into his wooden arm, I could no longer contain myself.In fact, more than any other Frankenstein film in the series, this one probably provides the most fodder for director Brooks in his hilarious offering. How about Elsa von Frankenstein's reply to 'that awful knocker? And didn't Gene Wilder bear just a little more resemblance to Rathbone's character than can be explained by mere coincidence? And when you get right down to it, those arm gyrations of the Inspector made it almost seem like Son was a parody of Young Frankenstein and not vice versa.Getting back to the matter at hand, it did seem to me though that the film got more and more camp as it progressed. By the time Baron Wolf is confronted by Krogh near the end of the film, he's (Wolf) just about over the top with his explanation of Ygor's demise - He tried to murder me with his hammer, so I shot him. Besides that, he seemed pretty deadly with the darts, it looked like he hit the bulls eye more than once.If you have the chance, try to view the Frankenstein films in order of release, as each sequel builds on the events of the prior movie.

Wayne wanted to concentrate on directing, but the money people forced his hand again.Billy Bob Thornton who played Crockett in a recent version of The Alamo story probably was closer to the mark than John Wayne was. Still the portrayal Wayne gives rings true and Crockett of the three main characters at the Alamo was probably the best of them by far.A recently restored version, the director's cut, fills quite a few gaps that the popular version released in 1960 had. Get that one by all means. Hank Worden has a touching death scene and Patrick Wayne's part is far more than in the version shown. In fact James Butler Bonham was quite the frontier character himself and a good film could be made of his life.I was in San Antonio last year and saw The Alamo again, the first time being in 1971. Then as now tourists from around the world come to the place to see where a legend was born. And a legend that will be told and told as long as man walks on the earth.

I find it's treatment of the characters to be largely without warmth. They are unlikable with a couple of exceptions, such as the Ricky and Jane characters. This unlikability is unrealistic. Surely, some people are very unsympathetic, but this movie goes out of it's way to take normal people and portray them as twisted freaks. For the most part, reality is not this harsh, not this glaring. People live with each other, see their faults, love them or not, but this desolate despair from emotionally stunted jerks that this movie portrays as being the norm, it's almost deliberately dishonest. If that is truly the experience of the people behind this film, I feel sorry for them. It's not that way for most people. Maybe if you are a teenager you experience life that way in your immaturity. An obvious hatred for what the makers of this film deem to be the morally bankrupt lifestyle of many Americans, overly consumed by the material and appearance. Everything in this world is bad. It only becomes good when they do things that are not only insane, but wholly irresponsible in people that have children that they should be caring for. Sorry, but I don't think it's acceptable to actualize yourself at the expense of your daughter. Does this happen in suburbia? To be sure. But it disturbs me to see so many people talking about how realistic this movie is, it just simply isn't.Furthermore, some of the stereotypes, such as Ricky's homophobic marine father who turns out to be gay himself, are embarrassingly trite, pat, and roll your eyes predictable.Having said that, there are also incredibly moving scenes in this picture. Ricky's description of the beauty of a plastic bag flying about in the wind will stay with me for a long time. It is one of the most lyrical, powerful and lovely moments I have ever seen on film.Also the ending, where the sometimes repulsive Lester has an epiphany and finally grows up is quite wonderful.Should you see it? Yes. But don't expect a masterpiece. ","genre":null},{"date":"25 October 2006","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Some of this movie is brilliant.

However Elena was high when it happened and has no memory of it and no interest in refreshing her memory, but when Victor refuses to leave they start to fight and Elena pulls a gun, which goes off when Victor knocks it away. The police are called and David and his bitter, drunkard partner Sancho respond. A struggle ensues after a brief standoff and while Victor and Sancho wrestle on the floor, the gun goes off and David is hit. Four years later Victor is released from prison, David is in a wheelchair and has married a clean Elena while Sancho is still trying to keep his relationship with wife Carla together. Victor's release brings these individuals back into contact and unleashes the emotions of that night again.Having just watched Volver and found it to be slightly below the standards of many of Almodóvar's other films, I decide to revisit Live Flesh. Aside from the opening cliché, this film is mostly free of his comic backdrops and the touches of absurd melodrama that often accompany some of his more exaggerated characters (this isn't a criticism so much as an observation). Here the film moves quickly from Victor's birth into the fateful event that sees him jailed and we find ourselves in a serious story that is well delivered. That the narrative is unpredictable and perhaps a tad unlikely is testimony to the realism in the characters because their emotions and motivations within this mix of guilt, hate and regret are contradictory and complex &#150; just as they would be in real life. But yet somehow Almodóvar holds it together and makes it engaging and, amazingly, convincing. I want to talk about how he turns this story into a tale I believed in but somehow he does; perhaps because he keeps it so raw and intense throughout, infecting even the sex with the emotions that exist within each character so that even those acts are borne of so much more than desire.Almodóvar also draws impressive performances from his cast which is a great help in pulling off the intensity of the tale. Cruz will be the name everyone knows but she only has a tiny role to play. It is hard to pick one stand out performance from Bardem, Neri and Rabal because the three of them are so convincing and seem to have totally engaged with their parts despite some of the actions being hard to accept on paper. Molina and Sancho are both good but their material is on the edge of the film and they aren't given the same opportunity to explore.Overall this is an impressive film that is raw and intense to the point that it compensates for the stretches within the plot. I can see why some viewers dislike it because it does take some swallowing but it is the impassioned and convincing delivery from director and actors that makes it as engaging as it is.

Despite the suggestion that his friend was involved in illegal money laundering the President gives the unofficial nod to National Security Adviser Cutter who falsifies a Presidential Order for Robert Ritter to employ a covert operation to strike at Escobedo's operations in Columbia. Meanwhile Ryan goes before the Senate to get funding for the fight on drugs &#150; although the funding does not include troops or direct action, which doesn't concern Jack as he is out of the loop on the covert op. While Jack tries to trace the money on the laundering, Clark's men get bombing in the Columbia jungle. However as things start to get out of control, political backs get covered, plausible deniability kicks in and both Ryan and Slater find themselves exposed and in danger.Despite Ryan's outings in Patriot Games and Sum of All Fears being roundly average at best, I decided to try this film and I actually found it quite easy to enjoy. The first thing to state is that it is very safe and commercial thriller in that, for all its supposed commentary on corruption and drugs, it really doesn't say much and the good guys and bad guys are painted very clearly and the lines between them are clean. Those familiar with the much more interesting look at America and drugs presented in HBO's The Wire will not find the same level of intelligence or comment in this film. Of course this doesn't make this a bad film, but perhaps a weaker one. The plot uses these clear lines and turns in an enjoyable if basic mix of political drama and action thrills. I found myself quite gripped by some parts and the plot regularly throw up tough talking and action to keep things interesting.Although Ford is already looking a bit older, he fits in perfectly on the intelligence side of the film but when he is called into action on the streets of Columbia then he doesn't look the part at all. Much better at this is Dafoe, who spends the majority of this in his own little action movie. He is convincing and was a good call for the role, although it doesn't help that the material calls for Ford to occupy equal status with him in the action stakes. Providing the political tough talk with good turns are Czerny, Yulin and Moffat &#150; each would have benefited from the script recognising the complexities of right and wrong but this wasn't the place for that. Almedia and Sandoval are both pretty average but they are handed half-cooked clichés to work with so it isn't really their fault.Overall this is a perfectly serviceable commercial thriller and I have no doubt that those who accepted the problems in Patriot Games and Sum of All Fears will find this easy to enjoy. Personally I would have liked a bit more intelligence instead of the black\/white approach but it still worked for what it was and it was effective in catching me up.
