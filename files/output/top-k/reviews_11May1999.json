Some of the films of this genre try to take themselves too seriously and end up as unintentional bad parodies (Godzilla). Others make the mistake of trying to be too campy and forget that a coherent story is also necessary (The Avengers). Still others don't know which direction to go and fail miserably on both sides (Congo).The Mummy on the other hand knows exactly what it is trying to be. A fun two hours with some thrills and laughs thrown in equal parts. Brendan Fraser borrows heavily from the Indiana Jones Book of Action Hero Acting, but is able to pull it off. He has an innate charm that allows you to believe his little throwaway lines and humorous threats. The real stand out in the film is John Hannah who plays the character of Jonathan.

She is looking for the book of Amon Ra, but finds a 3,000 year old mummy who's having a really rotten day.Let me begin by saying that I'm really not fond of horror films. I generally stay away from movies that have the primary purpose of scaring the audience. So, what was I doing at THE MUMMY?That can be answered in two words Brendan Fraser. I have enjoyed Fraser's performances in past films and find him to generally be a likable character. Unfortunately, he was miscast as the lead character of Rick O'Connell. In a role that called for cool-headed stoicism, he came across as stiff and befuddled. I believe his Encino Man and George of the Jungle characters have rubbed off on him. He was monosyllabic to the point of muteness.The script tried to give Fraser plenty of Arnold-esque throwaways to evoke laughter, but Fraser simply does not have Schwarzenegger's panache. Beyond a few mild chuckles, there wasn't much to evoke the campy feel that I believe the producers wanted. Fraser is affable, almost goofy, but he tried too hard to be hard-bitten when he should have accentuated his little-boy persona.There was a distinct been-there-done-that aura surrounding this entire production. The set-pieces and sequences were strictly by-the-book thriller\/action cliches ripped from countless other like-minded films. We have flesh-eating scarab beetles, ancient spells, American treasure-hunters, British intellectuals, a groveling evil sidekick, mysterious desert tribesmen, and lots of skeletal undead shuffling about.I also found the effects and cinematography to be disappointing. I like to get a movie experience when paying for a theatre ticket, and THE MUMMY failed to deliver. Much of the film plays out in the claustrophobic labyrinth beneath Hamunaptra. While the lighting was always done well-enough to see the action, it would look much the same on a small screen as it did on the large. And the CGI mummy was stiff and mechanical. Especially in the full-body shots, it moved more like a stop-motion model than computer wizardry.There were a few good scenes. One set of warrior mummies move with the grace and speed of giant cats. An old warrior gets a final chance at redemption and brings a lump to your throat. And there's some pretty good sword fighting in the climactic scene. In general, the supporting cast was solid, with decent acting jobs all around.So, what did I really like about THE MUMMY?That can also be answered in two words Rachel Weisz. As the inept librarian, Evelyn, she simply sparkled. She was a bright, effervescent light in a gray film. She added color and levity to every scene and bubbled over with more personality than most of the rest of the cast combined. Her naivete layered over a harder core makes her one of the more interesting heroines to appear on the silver screen in some time. THE MUMMY is definitely worth a look see for her appearance alone.But you may want to wait until the video is released.Cavebear's ranking for THE MUMMYQuality - 3 Solid, if unspectacular, film.Appeal - 2 Nothing new or exciting to offer fans or non-fans of the genre, but should play well until the Stars fall on May 19.

I don´t care about what the purists say. In atmosphere nothing can surpass this. It´s perfect ! It´s DUNE. It couldn´t have been done better.It captures perfectly the atmosphere of the first book.This was only a flop in the States, because it was publicized as if it were a new STAR WARS, wich obviously it is not. And I´m glad it isn´t.Imagine what would happen if DUNE was directed by George Lucas instead of David Lynch !

The share life lessons, deep secrets, and raging hormones over the course of two days. It's real easy to see why actors would want to be in this.  Friends is the type of film that's very actor friendly.  Director George Haas lets his cast have free reign over their performances, often resulting in self-conscious acting.  I was drawn to this for two reasons, Schiffer being the first.  I was curious about her acting (this being her second starring role, the first in a Able Ferrara film that has yet to find American distribution - actual proof that there is a God).  Needless to say, she stinks.  She just doesn't have the chops for the big screen.  The other reason I attended this was for Robert Downey Jr's hilarious performance as a German ski instructor named Hans.  He's the lone bright spot in this bizarre film. Some dramatics between Newbern and Rasche work well too, they just seem from a different movie.  The locations are nice, and the technical credits are appropriate. Plus when isn't it a good thing to see a schlocky old fashion 1987 ski montage complete with squealing guitars?  Anyone?  This wasn't terrible to sit through, but it is a bad film.

In that sense it serves a legitimate cinematic purpose and is not deliberately obscurantist in the manner of late Bunuel or Goddard.The film is also about friendship and betrayal, and achieves great poignancy the night before the assassination is due to take place, with all the major characters eating, dancing and laughing together. It also achieves a haunting evocation of 1930's Europe, presaging the horrible and traumatic events that are to come. An extraordinary piece of cinema.

There were a lot of characters introduced, but we aren't given much information about any of them.  The Brendan Fraser character is in a shootout, dressed in some uniform gunning down hundreds of assorted horsemen in the middle of the desert.  I've learned through reading the reviews and production information that he was in the Foreign Legion - but were we supposed to guess that ourselves?  I guess that the editing of this movie just wasn't that great. We are also introduced to this 'Beni' character, who bothered me because I couldn't tell WHAT he was.  Was he supposed to be an Egyptian?  Again, through reading on the net I find out he was from Budapest (what a terrible accent).  Which brings me to another gripe - in this day and age, why weren't more, or ANY, for that matter, Egyptians used for any of the main characters?  Even the pharoah's main guardsman is of European descent.  I also was not as enamoured of the brother character, 'the drunken English fop'.  I just thought he was an annoying afterthought, although I see that many people loved him.But enough of that.  I loved the mummy character - although I  had a hard time understanding why he was supposed to be so evil - he seemed like a sensitive romantic to me (other than the assassinating the pharoah thing). Brendan Fraser was gorgeous as usual - could we see some more chest please? I still wouldn't compare him to Harrison Ford as an action star though - there's still something missing, although it could be a fault of the script. And the librarian was beautiful and played her part very well.  I appreciated the no-gore policy of the film, but I still wouldn't take a child under 13 to see it.  Lots of decimated bodies, gouged-out eyeballs, flesh-eating giant beetles.  The special effects were GREAT.  In spite of what some others have commented, I thought the mummy's half-face and elongated jaw effects were fantastic.  Not to mention the sand wall thing.A fun movie for a Saturday matinee, and I will be renting it on video.

Who had that idea of replacing the soundtrack in the first place ?!!!! This is almost totally unbelievable !!!Once again, someone in Hollywood must have thought that Fantasy stories were just for kids and teenagers. How stupid can this people be?!!This movie in its European version is one of the best Fantasy movies ever made, and the best American fantasy movie without a doubt. Willow , was good, but it tried to much to be  STAR WARS meets INDIANA JONES stealing from Lord of the Rings   and so, it became too much of a teenage film instead.On the other hand  LEGEND , is a magnificent work of fantasy, wich despite having mostly a teenage cast, it manages to achieve a totally believable atmosphere of another world without turning into a  politically correct All American family movie  like most of all Hollywood fantasy productions are.Despite having a young cast in leading roles, we always feel this is an adult movie, for adult people who love Fantasy books. And just that, it´s a great achievement, by Ridlley Scott!I would love to see a movie from  Lord of the Rings , directed by him, because with  Legend  he has proved that he´s the man to do it.Besides the dwarves in  Legend , always remind me of Hobitts anyway. That´s one of the reasons I love this movie. Each time I watch it, I feel like as if I were watching something adapted by some TOLKIEN forgotten book.The atmosphere is incredible, the story it´s not bad and the characters are fabulous and very realistic. Specially the dwarves wich look amazing. Everyone looks excellent in fact.I don´t know what else to say, if you like fantasy novels this movie is the one to watch, along with  NEVERENDING STORY I.This must be the most underrated movie in years.
