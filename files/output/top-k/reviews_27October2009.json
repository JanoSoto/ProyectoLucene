Daring to be different, Run Lola run decides to be more original than sticking to the formula, giving us one of the best foreign language films... ever. Recent movies with similar plots never reaches it's potential, as Run Lola Run ticks all the right boxes. Pretentious, foreign language stuff that wants to become a cult hit in English- speaking countries? No. This isn't pretentious. Great for teenagers (like myself), and females will love that Lola isn't just there to look at like most female characters are in films. Lola is more sporty, furious and interesting than pretty and glamorous. This movie also gets you thinking, and will make you want to buy it on DVD, and watch it again and again.

When it started I knew this was going to be different; most of the characters didn't look like anime characters, they looked more like characters from western cartoons of the 1930s. This fitted in with the feel of the whole film which was a 1920s\/1930s view of the future reminiscent of Fritz Lang's film of the same name.Set in the city state of Metropolis where the robot underclass must stay in their designated areas and a scientist is building a robot that looks like a girl but is destined to run a new skyscraper known as the Ziggurat. Into this city comes a Japanese private detective and his nephew Kenichi who are seeking to arrest the scientist for organ trafficking. The state's de facto leader Duke Red's adopted son Rock is determined to destroy the robot thinking his father is replacing him. Rock starts a fire in the lab. During this the robot is activated and escapes with Kenichi although neither know that she isn't human. Rock continues to hunt them as the flee through the various layers of the city to a climax in the mysterious Ziggurat.I loved the retro feel to the animation along with a sound track that also felt like it was from that time. The use of the song I Can't Stop Loving You during the climactic scene was inspired. Even if you don't normally like animation this is worth watching as it is a good story which is well told.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.

Though my top ten (-twenty, -thirty) all-time favorites list undergoes some changes from time to time (The Big Lebowski keeps creeping upwards), On the Waterfront remains atop the list. I once owned the VHS. I own the DVD. I even own the soundtrack CD, one of the greatest of all time. Yet when I run into it on AMC or TCM, whether at the scene where Terry's explanation to Edie is drowned out by ship horns, or where he is sliding her glove onto his own hand, I find myself glued to the screen. Perhaps the best definition of an all-time favorite is one that grabs you whenever you happen to stumble upon it while channel surfing. This movie does that to me each and every time I encounter it. A masterpiece of American film making.
