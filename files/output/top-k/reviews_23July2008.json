[{"date":"23 July 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Ravenous (1999) Ravenous is a picture just weird enough to match its strange subject matter. For that it did itself no favours with the public, but it gained a certain amount of respect and admiration from a good many.Captain Boyd (Guy Pearce) is sent to a Californian Fort in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, as punishment for his cowardice. He is celebrated as a hero publicly after overtaking an enemy stronghold, but as he points out he was only able to do so by an act of cowardice. He played dead, and was stacked in with other dead men piled on top of him, their blood running into his mouth. This he says changed him, gave him strength, and he was subsequently able to fight his way out from behind enemy lines. Since it would set a bad precedent to explicitly punish him, the army sends him to the isolated post.Fort Spencer is cold, lonely, and quite unsettling. There is but a skeleton crew - Col. Hart (Jeffrey Jones), Pvt Toffler, the religious one (Jeremy Davies), Pvt Cleaves (David Arquette), Knox (Stephen Spinella), and Reich, the soldier (Neal McDonough). Also at the post are two Native Americans, George and Martha, who it is said more or less came with the location.One night a mysterious man shows up, claiming to have been lost on an expedition for three months now in the mountains. They survived by eating whatever they could until the first casualty, then they ate the body. Their taste for human meat was peaked, and they began killing each other off to quench their evergrowing hunger. That man is Calhoun (Robert Carlyle). He claims that he ran away from the group, and that there is only one woman left, and a man who's hunger could not be sufficed, Col Ives. He leads the soldiers to a cave where it turns out he is actually the real Col Ives, and has tricked them into a trap.The film turns from there into a cat and mouse game between Boyd and Ives, and a tale of to eat or not to eat human flesh, which the Native George explains allows the eater to gain the power of the eaten. Director Antonia Boyd, a vegetarian, makes scenes of eating rather repulsive, and uses music as a focal point for highlighting the strangeness of the picture. She makes Ravenous not a horror-gore fest (though there are moments horror in nature and occasional buckets of gore), but a pitch black comedy-thriller-suspense-mystery.The film is ambitious, maybe a little too ambitious for its script. It gets lost at times shifting between its genres and intentions, which likely was the directors intention though. This film is not just offbeat, its a mish mash of entirely different tempos. That could have been a recipe for disaster, but Bird handles things at just the right pace, and just the right oddity to create what really is a very unique and entertaining film. I like to think of Ravenous as something of a cult favorite of mine. I admire greatly the work here. Bird makes the locations feel cold, dirty, and uncomfortable, and the actors all hit their marks with the right resonance. Carlyle is particularly menacing, and darkly amusing, as Ives\/Calhoun. The actors should all be commended, not least for their courage to take on such a strange project that was clearly doomed to fail at the box office.The music is more or less a star in the film itself. Its strange, amusing, bewildering, and fascinating all at once.Yes, the story loses its way at times, and seems to be there simply to suffice the films style and texture, but Ravenous is a film that cries out for such style. I don't know if its necessarily aiming for greatness, but its reaching high into uncharted skies, and for that I am one of those who's admiration and respect Ravenous has earned.
