It is devoted to one of the biggest problems of modern society &#150; terrorism. And here is the main and insoluble problem of the movie &#150; the plot. The movie with such actual and troubled theme needs more than others movies a well-developed and plausible story but too many things go wrong in Arlington Road. Our main hero is widowed college professor Grant Faraday (played by Jeff Bridges), who has nine years old son and recently lost his wife, a FBI agent. The conception of her death during some anti-terrorist action and what is more the scene of ten years old kid shooting at strangers by the reason of guarding his home is ridiculously preposterous and disturbing as hell. For some coincidence (it is really impossible to count such coincidences in this story) our college professor teaches some indeterminate subject about terrorists and their way of thinking. One day after an accident with a little boy, he carries him into the hospital and than he finds out that he is a son of his new neighbor (played by Timm Robbins). He doesn't know anything about him but the boys become friends and this family is looking very friendly. But after noticing some strange things our hero begins to suspect that his neighbor is not the man he claims himself to be. His doubts become suspicions and grow more and more when trying to finds out who his neighbor is our professor finds out that years ago that man has been involved in a terrorist attack against a government building. After a series of hardly believable coincidences he will know truth and get involved in events he never expected to. But even all that I saw on screen before last fifteen minutes I can describe mostly as hardly believable, the preposterous ending ruined everything. Professor Faraday in a critical confrontation beat up our evil genius (Tim Robbins character) he leaves him and run but after that the person he just beat up and left gives a command to begin their plan. Climatic chase scene was ridiculous and the precise ending&#133; I agreed with all people here who said that it was one of the most unexpected plot twists I have ever seen but in the same time it was certainly the most ridiculous and implausible (not to mention one of the most disturbing) movie ending I have ever seen. I think only people who want suspense at any price can accept such course of events. I finally we get an explanation that practically everything from the beginning to the end of the story was planned by mentioned evil genius. Give me a break, please. And I don't even mention all numerous stereotypes in the movie.Besides that the point of the movie is unclear to me and I can't imagine a movie with such theme without it. Beware your neighbor? As it was already noticed in other reviews this is trivial fed for paranoia. Our society always balances between total neglect of a problem and such paranoia and both extremes are equally dangerous. The other possible idea here is that terrorist attack can't be organized and performed by a single person. That doesn't work much better because the movie doesn't show any strong steady organization around Oliver Lange. All that we can see is several people, most of them are definitely mentally sick, united and most likely manipulated by a very cunning fanatical person.With such story the acting (which is definitely not bad) is practically wasted but there is no point to blame actors or director because I believe that no one could make anything decent working with such ridiculous and implausible script.My grade 3 out of 10 (mainly for decent acting).

These are just a few of my favorite Adams Sandler films, and his best may I add. But some people consider The Waterboy Sandlers best film ever. Well I'm sorry but I beg to differ. Sandler plays Bobby Boucher Jr. who is considered an idiot because of his annoying accent and slow mind. His devil hating mama pampers him too much and he just got fired from his job as water boy distributer from a big college football team. Bobby then becomes the new water boy for the worst college football team ever The Mud Dogs, being coached by mentally broken down Coach Klien played by Henry Winkler. Bobby gets insulted by his new team mates only for the coach to tell him to stand up for himself. Bobby then pictures the people who has made fun of him in his life on his targets shoulders and tackles them to the ground! Thanks to Bobby's anger tackles, he becomes a tackler for the Mud Dogs and leads them to the Burbon Bowl. Problem is along the way, his momma goes into the hospital with a broken heart, Bobby's jail bird girlfriend disrespects him, and his old football team are the ones who will be facing him at the Bowl. What will Bobby do?I'm not saying this is a bad movie but it is totally off from a great movie. One main problem with the movie is Sandler himself. He does a great job as Bobby except his characters accent (which is more of a stutter, whine, scream, and mentally retarded yelp rolled into one) makes your eardrums cringe every time he speaks. It gets so annoying after half the film that you just can't wait for the movie to pick up the pace and be over with. But if you really get past the voice and look beyond the dumb atmosphere, you fall right into the movie and really enjoy it.Now Sandler isn't the only character that makes the film dumb. Every character in this movie is like a rejected Bugs Bunny cartoon character refused to be shown on cable broadcast. First there's Bobby with his nails on a chalk board voice, Coach Klien who likes acting retarded every time he has a bad play thrown, evil Coach Red who is just a stupid jerk, Farmer Fran the assistant coach who is nothing but a dumb Amish farmer who can't even speak right, Mama Boucher who's devil hating persona falls to the ground only after three minutes of depth, Rob Schnider as his classic Townie character who shout's nothing but You can do it!, and of coarse we have Vickie Valencourt, Bobby's love interest, but she isn't really needed in the movie. Sure she's a nice piece of cast decoration but her character is so annoying. She's a criminal, psychic, and murderer wrapped into one body and the only time she does anything good is to help Bobby at the big football bowl game in some stupid plot turn that only last a mere thirty seconds.The jokes are real cornball but in a good way. With all the football moments and hard tackling, the jokes are pretty low tack. The special effects are just plane bad looking when Bobby pictures his anger on people's shoulders and the coach pictures babies and pooches. Also the whole football team are nothing but big babies wearing jerseys. One is a dumb playboy, another is a dim witted Frankenstein, another seems like a gay punter who likes to picture KKK members heads on his football before he kicks em', it just gets so stupid after a while. You even get tired of watching this movie all the way up to the big bowl game at the end of the film after seeing all the really bad jokes and seeing Bobby tackle so many people for some stupid reason. Like in one scene, he tackles his professor for saying his mama was wrong about what makes an alligator so meanWhat the Waterboy is though is a good time slot filler. If you just want a slow paced dumb comedy, sure you will get a kick out of it. Like I said, it's not a bad movie but it's too stupid and corny just to take seriously. I enjoyed it a little so maybe you could too. I give the Waterboy a 6. If you want Classic Sandler, get Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison.

This intense and deeply moving family drama follows an advertising executive whose life is turned upside down when his wife of eight years, walks out on him, leaving him to care for his son and build a relationship with him he never had. Robert Benton's incisive screenplay presents us flawed, but real human beings with hearts, souls, and brains. For instance, in the scene where Joanna announces to Ted she's leaving him, she doesn't just storm out the door...she gives him the keys, her credit cards, the dry cleaning ticket, tells him which bills have been paid, and informs him she has withdrawn from their bank account the same amount of money she had when they were married, no more. This decision to leave was not a whim...it was thought about and Joanna felt, with no other option than to leave, if she was leaving she was going to do it properly...and with no specific plan in mind, she did not think it right to take Billy. Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar for his Ted Kramer, a man so obsessed with bringing home the bacon, he had no clue that his life at home was crumbling into pieces. Meryl Streep also won an Oscar playing Joanna, the unhappy wife who we feel sympathy for in the beginning of the film but that all changes when she returns for her son. Hoffman is at the top of his form here. I always tear up during the scene where he tries to explain to Billy (Justin Henry, Oscar nominee) why his mom left and he does it all in a stage whisper or when he meets Joanna upon her return and slams her drink into a wall (a Hoffman moment not in the script that Streep was not told about in order to get a natural reaction). Justin Henry hits all the right notes as Billy, the confused little boy who doesn't know why his mom is gone and doesn't know how to communicate with his father. Jane Alexander also got an Oscar nod as Ted and Joanna's neighbor, Margaret, who has switched allegiances by the film's conclusion. This is an intense family drama but there are laughs to be had here too...Billy and the chocolate chip ice cream...Billy pouting because Ted is late picking him for a party...Billy catching his dad's one night stand (JoBeth Williams) on her way to the bathroom stark naked, but it's the moments of human drama you remember...Ted running through Manhattan with Billy in his arms to get to the emergency room after BIlly falls off the jungle gym...Ted getting fired right before beginning his custody battle and instead of making a scene, he tells the guy in a whisper...Shame on you. And of course, the finale where Joanna tells Ted she's not taking Billy, which I found a little hard to swallow. Why would she go to all that trouble of suing for custody and then just change her mind?

First off, I saw this movie on the top 250, and it's #14 on top of that! I mean, it's gotta be great or a classic, right? Also, I'm a fan of the Simpsons, and I got the 6th season where Bart breaks his leg and has to watch the kids outside and accuses Flanders of murdering his wife, Maude. I watched it with commentary and the writers said this was taken from the movie Rear Window, I had to see this movie! I know it sounds silly that I was more inspired by a show, but it's a good reference if it's from The Simpsons.Rear Window is an excellent movie and a great classic that should never be forgotten! After 51 years, this is still a well talked about movie and I can see why. Jimmy Stewart, he's just so great as L.B., I loved his madness and his dark comical role. He doesn't even try, but you can't help but laugh at a lot of his lines, the way he looks, and the way he presents every scene. He didn't have a lot of movement, he is confined to a wheel chair, but he is so effective and perfect. No one could have replaced him as L.B., he's a terrific actor! Grace Kelly, what a beauty! Beauty and talent, what a great combination and she had it. Playing Liza, I loved her character so much. She started out as this extremely feminine lovely woman who is struggling with L.B., because he is having doubts about marrying her, and you can tell she loves him so much and is willing to do anything for him and to make their lives work, despite his adventurous side as a photographer and her being an indoor kitten. When L.B. talks of the murder to Liza, she is doubtful but never dismisses that it could be a possibility, and stays with him into the end. She finally goes into danger and grabs it by the you know what and wins L.B.'s heart.I loved the ending, to me it was just one more good laugh with L.B. and Liza.

He doesn't even try, but you can't help but laugh at a lot of his lines, the way he looks, and the way he presents every scene. He didn't have a lot of movement, he is confined to a wheel chair, but he is so effective and perfect. No one could have replaced him as L.B., he's a terrific actor! Grace Kelly, what a beauty! Beauty and talent, what a great combination and she had it. Playing Liza, I loved her character so much. She started out as this extremely feminine lovely woman who is struggling with L.B., because he is having doubts about marrying her, and you can tell she loves him so much and is willing to do anything for him and to make their lives work, despite his adventurous side as a photographer and her being an indoor kitten.

First of All,I can remember that there was a for-real, very bad Ice Storm that happened almost completely unexpectedly on a weekend night time frame wise between after Thanksgiving, but at least a week or two before Christmas 1973. I was caught in that storm. I was in my car,and on my to my Girlfriend's(she was 17 yrs. old)House.That Night,when I left my own home rain fell,butwhenI was driving on Interstate-95 the rain changed quickly to pounding ice pellets, and my car's defroster couldn't prevent all of my windows from freezing over. In the Darkness, and with only a very glaze view of things on the highway from inside my old Chevy, I could now just barely see other drivers headlights, and taillights which prevented me from a having or worse causing a very bad collision on the Interstate in the darkness. I moved my car as far to the right as possible, and luckily in no time in front of me saw a car's taillights veering right and descending-An Exit Ramp! Relief!-I immediately followed this car, and when I got to the bottom of this ramp,further luck,a gas station that was actually open at night(Remember the 1st Big Energy was going on then)with an attendant on duty. This Attendent sprayed all of my car windows with deicing fluid.This took care of that problem nicely for then at least. I also bought a can of WD40 from him to use in case the same problem came back on my journey. I next used the Gas Station's telephone to call my girlfriend and let her know why I was running late (I was also within 5 miles of her home so it was easier than turning back 15 miles in the other direction)but would soon arrive. Upon my arrival,she told me that her parents had already left to go visit relatives (also in another town)and thus encountered the exact same driving conditions that I had going the other direction. Her Parents knew of our plans to go out that night,and had called her immediately upon their arrival to try and get ahold of me if I hadn't left to advise to not attempt the trip and stay home,but if I had already departed my own home, then we should both just stay put there and not attempt to travel anywhere. Thats exactly what we did. We started off watching Columbo on TV, but eventually ended up on the floor of her living room next to the family Christmas Tree making love. Thats the main part of my story,and thats where I relate to parallels in the lives of these fictional characters. By the time her parents managed to get back,we had straightened up enough,and I ended up sleeping on their couch that night.As for the rest of the movie,I had an Uncle then who reminded me a lot of the Kevin Klein character in this movie. He was then a 40 something successful businessman,who had been married to his wife for well over 20 years, with a nice home,family,and overall lifestyle,but,unknown to all of his family he was having an affair with a woman who was also married. His wife would eventually find out,divorce him,with the result being that he would lose his very nice home and many of it's nice furnishings. His long established business failed over the years,he drank a lot more,and would die from health complications due to his drinking mixed with diabetes. He did marry his girlfriend after she obtained her own divorce and they stayed together until she passed on a couple of years before him.

There are times in the film, where scenes and things that were said, didn't need to be shown or mentioned.

A tribute to the players, the director, and the composer of that haunting musical score that will stay with you forever.The music is probably more important here than in most films, let alone most Hitchcock films. Because for most of the first half of the film and a great deal of the second half, it is without dialogue. In fact Kim Novak does not have a spoken line until about 48 minutes into the little more than 2 hour feature. She's under James Stewart's surveillance and the whole story of his growing obsession with her is told through his facial expressions and through Bernard Herrmann's music.Stewart is a cop retired on disability who is hired by an old college friend Tom Helmore to follow his wife. Helmore tells Stewart a tale about his wife falling under the spirit of her dead great grandmother who committed suicide. The wife he's following is played by Kim Novak. Novak in fact makes a suicide attempt and by jumping into San Francisco bay and Stewart jumps in and saves her.In a brief prologue the reason for Stewart's disability is told. While on the police force, he lost a man while pursuing the suspect in a rooftop chase. Another cop was killed trying to save Stewart who had slipped and was hanging on to a roof gutter for his dear life. After that Stewart acquired an understandable fear of heights with accompanying dizziness, vertigo.Later on at an old mission which has significance for Novak's family, Novak runs up to the top of the bell tower and Stewart because of his Vertigo can't pursue her to prevent her from jumping off and taking her life.Later on he spots Kim Novak again with a different color hair and this time essentially stalks her until they meet. By now he's totally obsessed with the dead Novak who he fell in love with.Alfred Hitchcock is plumbing some depths of the human psyche in Vertigo. Certainly good old all American Jimmy Stewart would not be one you would think of casting as a voyeur and a stalker. But he pulls off the performance in probably the film with the least dialogue Alfred Hitchcock ever made since sound came in.Kim Novak is hauntingly beautiful in Vertigo, she has to be or the whole plot would make no sense. Barbara Bel Geddes is in this also as Stewart's girl friend who finds herself losing him to an obsession with a ghost. She also serves as a sounding board for Stewart as he expresses some of his feelings to her.This was the first of two films Stewart and Novak made together. Ironically enough the second one, Bell Book and Candle, is about a witch played by Novak who actually uses witchcraft to ensnare Stewart. Given Stewart's obsession with Novak in Vertigo, if Hitchcock had thrown in witchcraft into the plot, the audience would certainly have believed it.Of course this is an Alfred Hitchcock film and therefore not all is as it seems. I can't sat any more, but there are no happy endings for anyone in this haunting film.

She's under James Stewart's surveillance and the whole story of his growing obsession with her is told through his facial expressions and through Bernard Herrmann's music.Stewart is a cop retired on disability who is hired by an old college friend Tom Helmore to follow his wife. Helmore tells Stewart a tale about his wife falling under the spirit of her dead great grandmother who committed suicide. The wife he's following is played by Kim Novak. Novak in fact makes a suicide attempt and by jumping into San Francisco bay and Stewart jumps in and saves her.In a brief prologue the reason for Stewart's disability is told. While on the police force, he lost a man while pursuing the suspect in a rooftop chase. Another cop was killed trying to save Stewart who had slipped and was hanging on to a roof gutter for his dear life. After that Stewart acquired an understandable fear of heights with accompanying dizziness, vertigo.Later on at an old mission which has significance for Novak's family, Novak runs up to the top of the bell tower and Stewart because of his Vertigo can't pursue her to prevent her from jumping off and taking her life.Later on he spots Kim Novak again with a different color hair and this time essentially stalks her until they meet. By now he's totally obsessed with the dead Novak who he fell in love with.Alfred Hitchcock is plumbing some depths of the human psyche in Vertigo. Certainly good old all American Jimmy Stewart would not be one you would think of casting as a voyeur and a stalker. But he pulls off the performance in probably the film with the least dialogue Alfred Hitchcock ever made since sound came in.Kim Novak is hauntingly beautiful in Vertigo, she has to be or the whole plot would make no sense. Barbara Bel Geddes is in this also as Stewart's girl friend who finds herself losing him to an obsession with a ghost. She also serves as a sounding board for Stewart as he expresses some of his feelings to her.This was the first of two films Stewart and Novak made together. Ironically enough the second one, Bell Book and Candle, is about a witch played by Novak who actually uses witchcraft to ensnare Stewart. Given Stewart's obsession with Novak in Vertigo, if Hitchcock had thrown in witchcraft into the plot, the audience would certainly have believed it.Of course this is an Alfred Hitchcock film and therefore not all is as it seems. I can't sat any more, but there are no happy endings for anyone in this haunting film.

Timothy Hutton won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his beautifully modulated performance as Conrad, the tortured teen who feels onstage after returning to school and cannot connect with his mother (Mary Tyler Moore), who he feels loved his brother more than he loved her and Donald Sutherland is the agonized husband\/father trying to keep the peace between his wife and son, clueless anymore as how to do so.

It's a chilling and brilliant moment, perfectly executed by Moore. Sissy SPacek won the Best Actress Oscar that year for COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER, but IMO, there was nothing done on screen by any actress that year that was better than Moore's performance in ORDINARY PEOPLE.

I won't exaggerate if I say this is maybe the greatest horror movie I ever saw. The horror here, if you overlook a few ominous ghostly apparitions in human shape some bleeding some not but always in broad light, lies more in the narrated situation developed through a series of scenes all of them well illuminated. As a matter of fact we don't have here the usual dark atmosphere nor lots of vampires, monsters or deformed ghosts. And if the haunted hotel house when seen from outside is sinister indeed all the interior scenes are filmed in broad light and the scenery is shown mostly in light colours contrasting with the omen always present almost from the beginning chiefly through the eyes of the little boy who has got supernatural knowledge powers. That makes it even more terrifying by creating the idea that it could happen to any of us. It's indeed the story of a nice normal couple with a beautiful young son that suddenly becomes a whirl of horror by the power of some hidden evil forces. I must confess I liked the performance of Shelley Duvall in the role of the frightened but courageous young mother better than Nicholson's. Though he is doubtless a great actor and has a good performance here, in the second part of the movie he is a bit too Grand Guignol for the general atmosphere of the movie with too many facial tics and grimaces. I wouldn't like to finish this comment without referring to the last scene of the chase of the boy in the snowy labyrinth which is thrilling indeed. Summing it up, it's an excellent movie with an excellent story (inspired in a Stephen King's novel), very well directed and with an excellent cast and an excellent scenery of interiors with inspired frames.

That prompted me to then rent Vanilla Sky. I relate that only because the order in which you see these movies is important. Specifically, by the time I saw VS, I knew everything about the story, and there was no longer any sense of unraveling a mystery that is an important part of these movies. But that is not all. On almost every score, Abre Los Ojos is the better movie. First the acting. In ALO, Penelope Cruz is sweet, loving and heartbreakingly beautiful. Reprising the same role in VS, she struggles with her Spanish accent, and there is absolutely no chemistry between her and Tom Cruise. Also, her character in VS repeatedly engages in a strange kind of smart-alecky banter that is not funny and is just plain misplaced in this movie. And yes, I hate to say it, but Ms. Cruz is nowhere near as attractive in VS as she was in ALO. Watch the movies back-to-back and the difference is startling. As for the other characters, I thought the spurned female role was better done in ALO. The actress who played Nuria in ALO conveyed a palpable sense of desperation and sadness, but also vulnerability. When she kills herself, and tries to take Cesar with her, it's believable. Not so with Cameron Diaz's portrayal of that same character in VS, who comes off as a spoiled tramp whose decision to kill herself seems like a hissy fit. That may not be all her fault. For instance, during the critical scene where she kills herself and tries to kill Cruise, Diaz is forced to utter dialog that is dopey and distractingly vulgar. Nuria has more grace, and more depth. Tom Cruise is not a terrible male lead, but the Spanish actor who played Cesar in ALO is much better suited for the role. He is younger, and portrays youthful arrogance and insouciance perfectly. There is also an innocence about him that Cruise can no longer do. Especially physically. At times in VS, I was thinking more about Tom Cruise's weightlifting regimen more than the mental anguish of his character. Unlike the crippling sadness of Cesar, Cruise's character is a turbo-charged superstar. In fact, it's not until the final scene, when the truth unravels itself, that Cruise finally brings his performance down to a human level. Last, the music. ALO has an unobtrusive, Hitchcockian score (see Vertigo to get my drift) that is haunting, and is very effective in creating a brooding, dreamlike atmosphere. Cameron Crowe's blaring soundtrack in VS, conversely, is a slick pop cliché that detracts, instead of enhances, the experience. The musical differences really do speak volumes here. ALO is dark, ethereal, and moving. VS is loud, brash, and coarse.

Unlike a lot of modern day remakes that have attempted to recapture the magic of Transformers, this movie was done during the prime of the series and the peak of its popularity. Overall I found the movie to be very well done. However, as mentioned by a few others, in ways this movie comes across like a giant advertisement.It seems an interesting coincidence that shortly after the movie the line of toys got shaken up with several changes. After watching the movie, I'm sure you can guess which character's toys got canceled and which ones were being pushed on consumers at the time. It is still an enjoyable movie, with a few notable differences not seen in the TV series prior to the movie. One rather large difference being that in the movie it is quite possible for the robots to sustain such injuries as to actually die, whereas in the entire series leading up to the movie, the exact opposite was true...they could sustain near body destroying damage, and just have parts swapped out and replaced and be good as new. This was one change that was received well by some fans and poorly by others.The movie has a surprising cast of some high profile actors doing the voices of the characters, and has a soundtrack that really fits each scene very well. Although the music is very 80s sounding, it is fitting as the movie was released during that time frame. In particular, the score written for the infamous scene involving Optimus Prime, was quite moving. I've seen adults watch that scene and get choked up by it.This was also what many fans feel to be the reason for the decline of the original series. Optimus Prime was the heart of the show, being the leader of the Autobots, (the good robots).... a lot of fans lost interest in the series when they killed him off in the movie. They brought him back at a later point, but it was really too little too late for it to save the series.The series, and the movie, is very enjoyable and still one of my favorites, despite all the obvious goof ups by its creators. However, much like is the case with Star Trek fans. If you are going to nit pick and focus on the mistakes, then you obviously aren't a fan and shouldn't be spending your time watching it.This movie stands well on its own, but I'd highly recommend renting the DVDs for the first couple of seasons of the TV series before watching this movie, or you can end up quite lost with a lot of things not making sense.

It is still an enjoyable movie, with a few notable differences not seen in the TV series prior to the movie. One rather large difference being that in the movie it is quite possible for the robots to sustain such injuries as to actually die, whereas in the entire series leading up to the movie, the exact opposite was true...they could sustain near body destroying damage, and just have parts swapped out and replaced and be good as new. This was one change that was received well by some fans and poorly by others.The movie has a surprising cast of some high profile actors doing the voices of the characters, and has a soundtrack that really fits each scene very well. Although the music is very 80s sounding, it is fitting as the movie was released during that time frame. In particular, the score written for the infamous scene involving Optimus Prime, was quite moving. I've seen adults watch that scene and get choked up by it.This was also what many fans feel to be the reason for the decline of the original series. Optimus Prime was the heart of the show, being the leader of the Autobots, (the good robots).... a lot of fans lost interest in the series when they killed him off in the movie. They brought him back at a later point, but it was really too little too late for it to save the series.The series, and the movie, is very enjoyable and still one of my favorites, despite all the obvious goof ups by its creators. However, much like is the case with Star Trek fans. If you are going to nit pick and focus on the mistakes, then you obviously aren't a fan and shouldn't be spending your time watching it.This movie stands well on its own, but I'd highly recommend renting the DVDs for the first couple of seasons of the TV series before watching this movie, or you can end up quite lost with a lot of things not making sense.

I play the piano and love period films, and after recently seeing the new release of Pride and Prejudice I felt that the short description offered on the satellite header promised more of the same. Other reviews summarize the plot well enough, so I will not do that. It is of more use to say that this film is not feminist so much as it is feminine. It is also extremely masculine at the same time... thank you Sam Neil and Harvey Keitel. Holly Hunter's character, Ada, expresses the concentrate of her human emotion in her music. That is why it is so important to her. It IS her voice. When the piano is taken away by her new husband, it is impossible for her to feel the love for him that he truly wants and needs. Sam Neil's character is actually a lovely man; he makes fatal mistakes about the piano though. Ultimately, it is not about the piano- but understanding. George gives Ada the understanding and the slow progression of emotional and physical intimacy that she should have received from her husband. He listens to her. That is what women want most. I've never seen that so poignantly displayed in any movie. Another reviewer was correct when she said that the movie flowed like a poem. Alisdair is not so jealous of what he sees through the walls of George's house as he is of the piano key inscribed with the pledge of Ada's heart to George. Yet, Ada is not completely indifferent to Alisdair. Not at all. Ada is looking for strength of will in the men around her, and inevitably in herself. I do understand the polarity in the reactions to the movie as it was exemplified in my own living room. As the credits rolled, my husband said,That was a weird movie.

I'd always recalled the film with fondness, although I could never remember why I liked it. Several years after seeing the movie I came across the John Lurie soundtrack and bought it without stopping to listen, and been slightly taken aback by it. The haunting pieces were more emotionally esoteric than I expected, and it took some time for the album to grow on me.Seeing the movie again, I understand why. The only piece of popular music in the film is Screamin' Jay Hawkin's I Put a Spell on You and, although I had forgotten that it was there, I guess that I had expected the soundtrack to be more like those of mainstream movies and have songs and such-like. I think that Lurie's music is perfect in situ and, as I've said, the soundtrack has also grown on me as standalone pieces.The movie itself is a masterpiece. The black and white images present a starkness and a clarity that heightens the alienation of self in a land that was supposed to be the new hope for immigrants from a decaying old world. Instead we see Eva walking through a deserted ghost world of New York where the graffiti says Yankee go home. America is only a dream, a collective vision of a better world; paradise somewhere on earth.As Willie and Eddie journey west after winning some money, we see that the supposedly beautiful city of Cleveland is cold and desolate with a frozen lake. The further trip to Florida ends in the middle of nowhere next to a bleak and windswept ocean. Paradise is still somewhere out of reach. I think that's why the movie appeals to me. It shows that the America of popular mythology - the home of the brave, land of the free, protector of the downtrodden, guardian of democracy in the free world - is merely a construct. Too many people these days believe in the child's fantasy of America being some paradise that Iraq and Afghanistan should emulate. Jarmusch reminds us that it is people who give meaning to a symbol, not the other way around. He allows for the ability of people to make their own meanings and evolve beyond the stagnation of popular culture.At a time I originally saw this movie I had recently left home and got my first job, moving from the country to the city, and maybe to some extent I identified with Eva - moving from Budapest to America.

The ending is a little unbelievable and drawn-out, but the movie is nonetheless excellent for two reasons.First, the very interesting and pertinent themes and issues that it raises (1) Can human beings ever master sufficiently advanced technology to create 'artificial intelligence' \/ robots that can simulate human beings (i.e. with feelings, emotions, etc.)? (2) If the answer is 'yes', should human beings create such a robot, for ethical and moral reasons? (3) If the answer is 'yes' again, what obligations do human beings owe this robot with feelings and emotions, i.e. what 'rights' does the robot have?The second reason is of course the spectacular performance by Haley Joel Osment. That boy is really quite an amazing actor. He provides the core of the movie as he undertakes his powerful emotional and physical journey. I have only watched two of his movies ('The Sixth Sense' and this one), and he is seriously brilliant. He captures the character so well; robotic in physical nature, but imbued with human emotions and enduring unconditional love. His facial expressions display such a natural childish innocence and affection, that it is almost impossible to believe that he was acting. A few scenes which particularly impressed me (1) where he begs his adopted human 'mother' not to leave him in the forest; (2) where he speaks to the 'Blue Fairy' after the 'super robots' excavates him from the ice wreckage; and (3) the closing scene where he hugs his 'mother' before climbing onto the bed next to her, clasping her hand.That boy truly should have won an Oscar for this.It would not be fair if I did not also mention the superb performance of the Teddy Bear (voice by Jack Angel) and the spellbinding musical score by John Williams.All in all, highly recommended. Stimulating, compelling, moving, touching and entertaining - a classic!

The ending is a little unbelievable and drawn-out, but the movie is nonetheless excellent for two reasons.First, the very interesting and pertinent themes and issues that it raises (1) Can human beings ever master sufficiently advanced technology to create 'artificial intelligence' \/ robots that can simulate human beings (i.e. with feelings, emotions, etc.)? (2) If the answer is 'yes', should human beings create such a robot, for ethical and moral reasons? (3) If the answer is 'yes' again, what obligations do human beings owe this robot with feelings and emotions, i.e. what 'rights' does the robot have?The second reason is of course the spectacular performance by Haley Joel Osment. That boy is really quite an amazing actor. He provides the core of the movie as he undertakes his powerful emotional and physical journey. I have only watched two of his movies ('The Sixth Sense' and this one), and he is seriously brilliant. He captures the character so well; robotic in physical nature, but imbued with human emotions and enduring unconditional love. His facial expressions display such a natural childish innocence and affection, that it is almost impossible to believe that he was acting. A few scenes which particularly impressed me (1) where he begs his adopted human 'mother' not to leave him in the forest; (2) where he speaks to the 'Blue Fairy' after the 'super robots' excavates him from the ice wreckage; and (3) the closing scene where he hugs his 'mother' before climbing onto the bed next to her, clasping her hand.That boy truly should have won an Oscar for this.It would not be fair if I did not also mention the superb performance of the Teddy Bear (voice by Jack Angel) and the spellbinding musical score by John Williams.All in all, highly recommended. Stimulating, compelling, moving, touching and entertaining - a classic!
