The could be a conversation going on then one of the actors will just drift to talk about an object in such a manner you wonder if they have lost it, only for you to figure out seconds later that it was an advert in the show, that was very creative.Before making this masterpiece, Jim Carrey had just finish Cable Guy (1996) and Liar Liar (1997).The movie is directed by Peter Weir (Master and Commander The Far Side of the World (2003)), who did a great job pulling the viewers along as they watch a movie of a show.

Based on what you know from the first one, it is a given that there will be shark attacks. But all that consists of the story is a group of rebellious kids who decide to go sailing and...well I'm sure you can guess what happens next.

Going into this film I had heard many call it the worst of Moore's Bond films but I think that's a tad bit strong as this is no where near as bad as MOONRAKER for example. I do think the film is a disappointment because it could have been so much better but as it stands it's a decent entry in the series.

I'm not sure if this was done because of the actor's age or if they were just poorly shot. I think they could have been poorly shot because the film does feature some pretty questionable directorial choices. One strange thing happens during a pretty good opening sequence and that's The Beach Boys song being played over it. I'm really not sure what they were thinking with this thing and it gets somewhat worse later in the picture when a dimwitted cop keeps getting screen time. I also don't understand the casting of Tanya Roberts as she turns out to be the worst Bond girl to date. Grace Jones is, strange, to say the least.

Director Paul Brickman does a very good job with his screenplay, which is certainly one of the most important things in making this work. There were a lot of movies based around horny teenagers but this here is certainly one of the best because of how serious the subject is taken. This isn't just a naughty sex romp but instead it takes a serious look at this teenager and the pressures on him ranging from his parent's expectations as well as getting into college and losing his virginity. The story really allows the lead character to grow and it's rather interesting watching how the film plays out to where it teaches him a lesson about life and going after what you want. Of course, this isn't 100% drama and we get several funny moments and situations scattered throughout including a wonderful bit dealing with his father's car. The film also manages to be incredibly sexy during the sex scenes. Most memorably the first romp with the hooker as well as a later scene set on a train. Some of the best and most underrated moments happen before the hooker even arrives as the director really gives one the details of that burning desire in teenage boys. Cruise was perfectly cast here as the bright student who still had a few things to learn. I thought he perfectly handled every aspect of the role from the early, weak virgin to the later power player.

Director Paul Brickman does a very good job with his screenplay, which is certainly one of the most important things in making this work. There were a lot of movies based around horny teenagers but this here is certainly one of the best because of how serious the subject is taken. This isn't just a naughty sex romp but instead it takes a serious look at this teenager and the pressures on him ranging from his parent's expectations as well as getting into college and losing his virginity. The story really allows the lead character to grow and it's rather interesting watching how the film plays out to where it teaches him a lesson about life and going after what you want. Of course, this isn't 100% drama and we get several funny moments and situations scattered throughout including a wonderful bit dealing with his father's car. The film also manages to be incredibly sexy during the sex scenes. Most memorably the first romp with the hooker as well as a later scene set on a train. Some of the best and most underrated moments happen before the hooker even arrives as the director really gives one the details of that burning desire in teenage boys. Cruise was perfectly cast here as the bright student who still had a few things to learn. I thought he perfectly handled every aspect of the role from the early, weak virgin to the later power player.

Music is scored by Nile Rodgers and cinematography by Sol Negrin and Woody Omens. Plot finds Murphy as Akeem Joffer, an African prince who comes to the United States in the hope of finding a good woman he can marry.Released at a time when Eddie Murphy was ruling the 80s, Coming to America proves to be viable material for Murphy's talents. That's not to say it's a great film, a good one? Debatable now, and it was for sure a success at the box office, but it feels like a lazy excuse for some one liners and the picture hangs on a flimsy premise thread. As a whole it barely works as a romantic comedy (in fact the romance is distinctly tepid), but as a series of comedy set-ups for Murphy and Arsenio it does entertain the nostalgists and those who like immature gags. You do feel that with director Landis stating that Murphy was a pain on set-that Eddie had lost the zest and the willingness to learn that he had on Trading Places five years earlier, that Murphy didn't let Landis produce the picture the director originally envisaged.No doubt about it, I liked the film much better back in the day, back then the fish out of water comedy hadn't been done to death, and of course Murphy was still coasting in on the wave of charismatic success, which to myself and many others was enough to warrant being in his company. However, watching it now it feels tired and weary, the one film in Murphy's 80s comedy output that doesn't hold up, a chore to get through at nearly two hours in length, many comedy sequences stretched too far (the multi character gimmick played by the leads runs out of steam), an indulgence to ride in on the appeal of the film's two stars. The film actually marks a turning point for Murphy, he would follow this film with eight years of cinema mediocrity, something which I do believe lends Murphy fans to praise Coming to America far higher than they should.It's certainly not a stinker, not at all. There is occasionally fun to be had, some well written gags, honest intentions to create a charming characterisation for the people. While a cameo appearance by a future star is always worth watching. But in the minority as I am about it, and I do consider myself a Murphy fan, I have to say the film smacks of cheating and laziness, and no amount of penis gags can alter how I now feel about it.

The teen gets in trouble for what he believes in but soon he starts to show the others what a good time can come from dancing. Yes, the story is incredibly silly and yes it's incredibly predictable but who cares when something is this fun? FOOTLOOSE is just like those drive-in films from the 1950s, the ones that tried to explain to parents why rock and roll music wouldn't turn them into evil demons. This type of film was running wild back in the 1950s and I think it works perfectly well when updated to 1984. Again, I don't blame anyone for attacking the story but those who do so are just taking it way too serious when the main goal of the movie was to have viewers just kicking back and having a good time. I think the majority of the success is due to the terrific performance from Bacon who perfectly fits the role of the outcast who tries to take on an entire community. Bacon was exceptionally believable in the part and handled everything from the dramatic scenes to the lighter ones. Even his dancing hits the high marks. Lori Singer doesn't come close to matching him but she makes for a nice supporting player in the role of the girlfriend. Lithgow is his typical entertaining self and it's nice seeing Wiest even though her role is terribly underwritten. Another big thumbs up has to go to Christopher Penn in his role of the redneck who doesn't know how to dance. Another major factor to the film's success is the terrific soundtrack including the hit title track by Kenny Loggins. I'm not sure why anyone would go into FOOTLOOSE expecting some sort of art picture. It's a fast, fun film dealing with teenagers and rock and roll. It might not be a Bergman film but it's still very entertaining and that's the most important thing.

Romero's Night of the Living Dead is one of the greatest horror films of all time that along with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho gave birth to the modern Horror film. Made on a shoe string budget(114,000$),NOTLD is one of the most terrifying and scariest horror films ever made and set the standard for other zombie films that followed. It's not only one of my favorite horror films it's one of my favorite films period.Night Of the Living Dead tells the story of sister and brother Barbara(Judith O'Dea)and Johnny(Russell Streineryard) who arrive at a grave yard to visit their father's grave. While there, Barbara is attacked by a man and when Johnny tries to save Barbara Johnny is killed by the attacker.It turns out the attacker isn't a human,but a zombie back from the dead. Scared and frightened, Barbara runs off,but stops and runs into a farmhouse where other people including a man named Ben(Duane Jones) have occupied the house. Now, Ben,Barbara,and the other survivors must find a way to fend off the zombies and survive the Night of the Living Dead.Night of the Living Dead is not only a great horror film,but, a great film that came out at the right place at the right time in 1968. Violence was in the air and NOTLD portrays that well on the screen with a bleak outlook. In 1968 the Vietnam war was happening and was splitting America apart,racial violence and tensions were at an all-time high,and Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were both assassinated. NOTLD while a horror film was also statement about what was going on at the time in America,showing us the viewers that America was at war with no only the rest of the world,but themselves as well. One of the other things I love about NOTLD is the bleakness and hopelessness of the film where you feel that no character in the film is safe no matter what whether your a hero or villain. It doesn't matter who you are or where you are a zombie will come and kill you and eat you and it's a disturbing concept. The shy's away from film clichés and offers no salvation or safety or hope. I also love the fact that the film was shot in black and white and shot almost like a documentary adding to the film's dark and gritty tone. The scary documentary feel of the film gives you the feeling of realism where it feels like your in the film with the characters and going through what they're going through and you can relate to the characters and their bad situation. The characters aren't Horror film stereotypes,but real people that are not one note and when things start to go hell you feel bad for them. This film was at the forefront of cynical 70s Horror cinema or cinema in general that was getting away from film where characters lived happily ever after. This was a very revolutionary at the time and still is. NOTLD paved the way for low budget Horror cinema in the 70s and 80s otherwise without this film there would be no landmark Horror classics such as Halloween,The Evil Dead,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Re-Animator just to name a few and also influenced and inspired filmmakers such as John Carpenter(The Thing,Halloween),Wes Craven(A Nightmare On Elm Street,The Last House On The Left),Sam Raimi(The Evil Dead)and Tobe Hooper(The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,Poltergeist)and will continue to influence and inspire filmmakers for years and generations to come. The violence and gore in the film is disturbing and for it's time was something wasn't seen before The film and pretty along with Psycho reinvented violence in Horror film. George A. Romero would push the gore and violence even further with Dawn Of The Dead and Day Of The Dead. NOTLD is also great because of how it portrays zombies. You will be looking over your shoulder. Before NOTLD zombies in horror films were more associated with mostly voodoo and the supernatural,but in this film the zombies are regular people people that are your family members,friends or neighbors. There's nothing scarier than the people you love becoming zombies and wanting to eat you and kill you. I also loved the fact that George Romero cast an African-American in the role as the hero in the film was a bold move to do and whether the casting was intentional or not. The ending of the NOTLD is amazing and one of the most shocking and powerful endings in film history and it's a finale that adds to the greatness of NOTLD and is an ending that will stay with you after you watch the film. A brilliant conclusion. The acting and cast are great here. Duane Jones is excellent as the hero Ben one of the few African-American hero's in a horror film. Jones brings a dignity and take charge attitude to the role and it's a great performance. Judith O'Dea does a wonderful job as Barbara bringing a believable performance to the role. Karl Hardman is great as the villain Harry Cooper a character that we don't always like,but does have a couple of points about living and being safe. Marylin Eastman does a fine job as Helen Cooper,Harry's wife. Keith Wayne and Judith Ridley do good jobs as Tom and Judy the young couple. George Kosana(Sheriff McClelland),Bill 'Chilly Billy' Cardile(Field Reporter)and S. William Hinzman(Zombie In Graveyard)give good performances as well.George A. Romero's direction is excellent bringing a frightening and stark reality to the film with the tilted camera angles and black and white photography. Romero's direction gives the film an almost documentary feel to it and a gritty realism. Great job by Romero.In final word,If you love Horror films,Cult films,or films in general I highly suggest you see Night Of The Living Dead,a landmark Horror classic that will stand the test of time is a film that you can watch again and again.

Romero's Night of the Living Dead is one of the greatest horror films of all time that along with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho gave birth to the modern Horror film. Made on a shoe string budget(114,000$),NOTLD is one of the most terrifying and scariest horror films ever made and set the standard for other zombie films that followed. It's not only one of my favorite horror films it's one of my favorite films period.Night Of the Living Dead tells the story of sister and brother Barbara(Judith O'Dea)and Johnny(Russell Streineryard) who arrive at a grave yard to visit their father's grave. While there, Barbara is attacked by a man and when Johnny tries to save Barbara Johnny is killed by the attacker.It turns out the attacker isn't a human,but a zombie back from the dead. Scared and frightened, Barbara runs off,but stops and runs into a farmhouse where other people including a man named Ben(Duane Jones) have occupied the house. Now, Ben,Barbara,and the other survivors must find a way to fend off the zombies and survive the Night of the Living Dead.Night of the Living Dead is not only a great horror film,but, a great film that came out at the right place at the right time in 1968. Violence was in the air and NOTLD portrays that well on the screen with a bleak outlook. In 1968 the Vietnam war was happening and was splitting America apart,racial violence and tensions were at an all-time high,and Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were both assassinated. NOTLD while a horror film was also statement about what was going on at the time in America,showing us the viewers that America was at war with no only the rest of the world,but themselves as well. One of the other things I love about NOTLD is the bleakness and hopelessness of the film where you feel that no character in the film is safe no matter what whether your a hero or villain. It doesn't matter who you are or where you are a zombie will come and kill you and eat you and it's a disturbing concept. The shy's away from film clichés and offers no salvation or safety or hope. I also love the fact that the film was shot in black and white and shot almost like a documentary adding to the film's dark and gritty tone. The scary documentary feel of the film gives you the feeling of realism where it feels like your in the film with the characters and going through what they're going through and you can relate to the characters and their bad situation. The characters aren't Horror film stereotypes,but real people that are not one note and when things start to go hell you feel bad for them. This film was at the forefront of cynical 70s Horror cinema or cinema in general that was getting away from film where characters lived happily ever after.

The funniest thing about reading user-comments on anthologies, even more so than with regular long-feature films, is the diversity in people's opinions. Even when people reward the film with the same overall rating out of ten, you still read stuff like segment #3 is inarguably the best part of the film in the one review and sketch number 7 towers head and shoulders in another. Fact simply remains that tastes may vary, but general consensus at least confirms that this early Woody Allen effort is a fantastically entertaining &#x96; albeit wildly uneven &#x96; comedy achievement, with an original basic concept, a truly imaginative structure and several downright hilarious and unforgettable sequences. Also, and this is speaking from a more cinematic point of view, this is a brilliant film because nearly every separate fragment successfully parodies other and entirely different genres of filmmaking, like B-horror movies, Shakespearian plays, Science Fiction and talkative European sleaze flicks. Personally, I'm not the biggest expert on Woody Allen movies and I have yet to see the vast majority of his repertoire. But I don't plan to do so, as I already know that his newer work doesn't interest me that much. His earliest work, on the contrary, I find perplexing and utmost versatile. The ideas behind movies like What's Up Tiger Lilly, Bananas and Sleeper are sheer genius. Every Thing You Always &#x85; etc is also like that. This movie is actually based on an existing educative book from a prominent doctor, but then made into a slapstick format, allegedly as some kind of revenge because this doctor used a Woody Allen joke during a lecture without mentioning the source. So the questions raised at the beginning of each segment are genuine, but the responses are obviously fictional and illustrated through the most incredibly grotesque situations and absurd characters. The query whether or not aphrodisiacs work, for example, is told through the tale of a clumsy castle jester who successfully seduces the queen with a love potion, but then literally bumps into her chastity belt. Or, in what is perhaps the most ingenious comical sketch ever scripted, we receive an answer to the question what happens during the ejaculation? through portraying the human brain as a NASA-like headquarters where engineers and switchboard operators instruct workmen to generate an erection and sperm cells to dive into the unknown. Call me biased, but inventing situations and one-liners like these requires absolutely brilliance and extremely talented writing skills. The younger Woody Allen had it. My own personal favorite episodes (since I don't feel entitled to label them as best) include the aforementioned What happens during the ejaculation? and also What are sex perverts? The latter is presented in the shape of a prototypic 1950's TV-show, complete with black and white photography, inferior picture quality and truly doesn't avoid any taboos. And since I'm primarily a fan of old horror and cult movies, I also worshiped the episode Are the Findings of Doctors and Clinics Who Do Sexual Research and Experiments Accurate? in a mad scientist &#x96; played by John Carradine &#x96; accidentally unleashes a gigantic and monstrous female breast upon a rural community. Honesty obliges me to state that sadly not all segments are equally terrific. The story with Gene Wilder, as a doctor falling in love with an Armenian sheep, is definitely courageous, but also quite tedious and not that laugh-out-loud funny. The Fellini parody is also interesting, but outstays its welcome as well. Woody Allen himself stars in four out of seven episodes (most notably as the petrified sperm) and he could also count on a strong supportive cast, including Lou Jacobi, Burt Reynolds and Lynn Redgrave.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"7 September 2012","score":"","review":" Every Thing You Always &#x85; etc is a sort of anthology movie, composed of seven different fragments sharing one and the same general theme, in this case (semi-)embarrassing sexual inquiries. The funniest thing about reading user-comments on anthologies, even more so than with regular long-feature films, is the diversity in people's opinions. Even when people reward the film with the same overall rating out of ten, you still read stuff like segment #3 is inarguably the best part of the film in the one review and sketch number 7 towers head and shoulders in another. Fact simply remains that tastes may vary, but general consensus at least confirms that this early Woody Allen effort is a fantastically entertaining &#x96; albeit wildly uneven &#x96; comedy achievement, with an original basic concept, a truly imaginative structure and several downright hilarious and unforgettable sequences. Also, and this is speaking from a more cinematic point of view, this is a brilliant film because nearly every separate fragment successfully parodies other and entirely different genres of filmmaking, like B-horror movies, Shakespearian plays, Science Fiction and talkative European sleaze flicks. Personally, I'm not the biggest expert on Woody Allen movies and I have yet to see the vast majority of his repertoire. But I don't plan to do so, as I already know that his newer work doesn't interest me that much. His earliest work, on the contrary, I find perplexing and utmost versatile. The ideas behind movies like What's Up Tiger Lilly, Bananas and Sleeper are sheer genius. Every Thing You Always &#x85; etc is also like that. This movie is actually based on an existing educative book from a prominent doctor, but then made into a slapstick format, allegedly as some kind of revenge because this doctor used a Woody Allen joke during a lecture without mentioning the source. So the questions raised at the beginning of each segment are genuine, but the responses are obviously fictional and illustrated through the most incredibly grotesque situations and absurd characters. The query whether or not aphrodisiacs work, for example, is told through the tale of a clumsy castle jester who successfully seduces the queen with a love potion, but then literally bumps into her chastity belt. Or, in what is perhaps the most ingenious comical sketch ever scripted, we receive an answer to the question what happens during the ejaculation? through portraying the human brain as a NASA-like headquarters where engineers and switchboard operators instruct workmen to generate an erection and sperm cells to dive into the unknown. Call me biased, but inventing situations and one-liners like these requires absolutely brilliance and extremely talented writing skills. The younger Woody Allen had it. My own personal favorite episodes (since I don't feel entitled to label them as best) include the aforementioned What happens during the ejaculation? and also What are sex perverts? The latter is presented in the shape of a prototypic 1950's TV-show, complete with black and white photography, inferior picture quality and truly doesn't avoid any taboos. And since I'm primarily a fan of old horror and cult movies, I also worshiped the episode Are the Findings of Doctors and Clinics Who Do Sexual Research and Experiments Accurate? in a mad scientist &#x96; played by John Carradine &#x96; accidentally unleashes a gigantic and monstrous female breast upon a rural community. Honesty obliges me to state that sadly not all segments are equally terrific. The story with Gene Wilder, as a doctor falling in love with an Armenian sheep, is definitely courageous, but also quite tedious and not that laugh-out-loud funny. The Fellini parody is also interesting, but outstays its welcome as well. Woody Allen himself stars in four out of seven episodes (most notably as the petrified sperm) and he could also count on a strong supportive cast, including Lou Jacobi, Burt Reynolds and Lynn Redgrave. The film is an absolute must in case you seek out all legendary comedy classics.

A transformation that morphed the male ideal to one of feminine beauty. But in between the laconic, rugged individualist (Gary Cooper, Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne) and the cute, physically non-threatening boy toy (David Cassidy, Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger) was the charismatic outsider (Marlon Brando, James Dean, Paul Newman) beguiling yet dangerous, clean cut yet anti-authoritarian--refusing to give in to the societal polemic that demanded conformity. And this post-modern male persona, established in many movies (ON THE WATERFRONT, FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE to name only three) was perhaps best exemplified in the movie COOL HAND Luke.We fall in love with Luke during the opening scene, I think The utter stupidity of a grown man, drunk & alone, cutting off heads of parking meters is, well, damn satisfying to watch. There's something Dostoevskian about it (from NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND What about the millions of facts that show that men, deliberately and in full knowledge of what their real interests were, spurned them and rushed in a different direction? They did so at their own risk. . .refusing to follow the safe, well-trodden path and searching for another path, a difficult one, stubbornly working their way along it in the darkness). And our love of Luke is sealed&#x97;after he opens the beer he'll never drink&#x97;at the beginning on that beautiful freeze-frame of him laughing at life her struggles, her injustices, her seeming insistence that we conform, or else.And that is also why we loved Paul Newman. He deflected (or more accurately Fast Eddie, Luke, Butch, & Henry Gondorf did) the slings and arrows life through at him with a grin and a twinkle in his eye that couldn't help but win us over to his side. We are so rooting for Luke to connect with his mother, to escape the chain gang, to achieve the miraculous feat of eating 50 eggs. And speaking of miracles, you may or may not know that this movie is a retelling of the story of Jesus (complete with disciples, miracles, persecution, doubt, prayer, crucifixion, and resurrection).The last image we see is of a photo in a magazine Luke had sent the chain gang showing him living the good life. When they find out the picture is a phony and that Luke is not the man they thought he was, Dragline rips it up. At the end of the movie, the photo has been resurrected the repaired rips forming a Cross after faith in Luke has been restored. But however you chose to interpret COOL HAND Luke, it is Paul Newman whom we ultimately respond to. With all the lives he impacted, he was--on and off the screen--one of the quintessential American males of his times. I mean, think about it. Is there anything more irrelevant than a movie star?
