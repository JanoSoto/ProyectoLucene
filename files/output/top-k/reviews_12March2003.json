Every year he goes to Puxatawney, Pennsylvania for the Puxatawney Phil event commonly recognized as Groundhog Day. You know how it goes. The groundhog comes out. If it sees its shadow, it's six more weeks of winter. If it doesn't, it's spring.Well, the only problem about going to this event every year for Phil is that he hates it. He hates the cheery people. The little town. The weather. The event. The story. Everything. He hates it. He is a lonely, desolate, forsaken soul. With a great cynical side.Andie McDowell plays a new manager--err, womanager )--who goes with Phil to the event, along with Chris Elliot, the cameraman. Phil reports, they tape it, it's a done deal. The end. Phil goes back home. Only one problem. Due to severe weather, the roads have all been closed, leaving only one option Stay in Puxatawney until the storm blows over. So, Phil heads back to his cheery hotel, and tucks in for a dreaded nap. But when he wakes the next morning, something odd happens. The day is the exact same day as before. It is Groundhog Day. Again. Phil panics as he finds everything exactly the same as it was the day before. He knows everything that is going to happen. He shrugs it off as a weird case of deja-vu and heads back to sleep. But when he wakes up, alas! The day is...yesterday. Again. Technically.So Phil comes to terms with the fact that there is now way out of this small little town. He tries everything. He steps in front of a moving car. He electrocutes himself. He jumps off a building. All to no avail. Oh, he dies, all right. But the next day he's back and it's Groundhog Day again.Part of what makes Groundhog Day so excellent is the story. The characters and actors alone are great enough to recommend this movie, but the truth is, I cannot think of a better story to throw someone like Bill Murray into. He uses his smart-alecky ways to a new extreme. His character is a bit like Scrooge from the tale A Christmas Story, which is ironic, because Murray was in a parody on Scrooge's tale called Scrooged. Anyway. Bill Murray is perfect as the irreverent and cynical Phil. Everything he does he carries out with a dumb, I'm-smarter-than-you face. He thinks himself better than everyone else. He thinks he is smart by skipping the big Holiday ordeal. It is all so stupid to him. But, as this story teaches us, having an attitude like that can get you in big trouble.Harold Ramis, director of Analyze This, star of Stripes, directed Groundhog Day. Bill and he are old pals, and it sure shows. I bet they had a great time making this movie. But what is good about it is that while making a fun movie they didn't forget to come up with an interesting and audience-catching tale.Another thing that is great about Groundhog Day is that Phil Connors does what we would do. For example When he finds out he has this ability to repeat the same day over and over, he does things the average person would do. The human weakness. Too many comedies with the same formula don't try to exploit this human weakness, but Groundhog Day does. We see Phil memorize the steps to successfully robbing an armored truck filled with cash. But the reason he can go to bed with a clear conscience is because he knows the next day that everything will be back to normal again. He will never have robbed the truck, never have bought a Ferarri, etc. Phil does what WE would do, and that is one importance aspect of Groundhog Day. I would never rob an armored truck, but if I was stuck living the same day over and over, it would do no harm to take the cash - it would be back in the truck in the morning! So, I might do that. (although my conscience would still get in the way.) There was a little comedy with John Candy named Delirious. It was about a soap opera writer getting trapped in his own world. And everything he writes on his typewriter comes true. While the movie was good, and pretty interesting, there were so many things Candy could have done with the ability to create and control any - and every- thing, and he didn't do them. I think that's where Groundhog Day steps in, filling in the blanks. There's nothing I love more than watching a comedy where the main character divulges into the human nature - in other words, I love watching the character do something the average human would do when given the power(s). And that's exactly what Phil does in Groundhog Day. And that is why, among other things, it is one of my favorites.5\/5 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"12 March 2003","score":"105 out of 176 people found the following review useful","review":" Bill Murray plays Phil Connors, a weatherman for a local news station.

I also never got off my butt to rent it because too lazy\/busy, whatever, and so finally I caught it on Sky Premier tonight.

Is a load of explosions and people in skimpy outfits all that will entertain people at the movies these days? Reading some of the reviews on IMDB of this movie, my estimation of the movie-going public in the west (or at least some of them on IMDB anyway) has definately been lowered a few notches, the story was complicated? The FF game series isnt exactly known for its toddler-simple storylines now is it? Its pretty obvious why Solaris bombed in the US if this is what it had to deal with. Dya think that just because a movie is an animation it has to be mindless kiddie-drivel with no soul and a message of friendship with cutesy Disney animals?

The movie was visually breathtaking (though i was trying my hardest not to nitpick given all the great reviews on its looks i really was looking for flaws, so sue me! *angel face*) the storyline was complex and intriguing, I think it was pretty obvious the movie was not aimed at a young audience (i caught the sneaky-and not so- swear words) but if we were measuring it by anime standards it could be considered pretty tame. It was tragic, but i had a feeling one of the main characters would end up dying, but i think it just adds to the emotional weight. I'm a Christian but i had no problem grasping the Gaia subject, it made sense in a world like that, i think it was handled with maturity and grace. Although sometimes bits of it seemed a little 'too perfect' if you could call it that, with the fight scenes and a few other bits, overall it was a stunning movie, thoughtful, poignant, breathtaking, innovative and heartfelt and it is well worth a watch so you can make up your own mind.

I liked the fact that Mel Gibson didn't seem to own any guns - being an ex-reverend and everything, and the cursing scene was funny too.I don't think films should necessarily give you nice neat endings and answer all your questions. I think that M Night Shayamalan would be pleased to see how many people are outraged by the loose ends, I'm sure it's exactly what he would have wanted to see.

CONTAINS SPOILERS  !!!!!!Okay, I've read a lot of criticism about this film but I have to defend it.If anyone has read 'Tommyknockers' by Stephen King they will be aware of the stupid alien theory. Okay they can travel to earth but maybe they didn't invent interstellar travel, they could have poached it form some other nearby species or inherited it from a previously enlightened culture on their own planet ( I mean, when the ancient Egyptians were building pyramids , some cultures were still living in caves in other parts of the world ). If they were that smart they would have been far more subtle and used more insidious ways to get what they wanted rather than the very clumsy methods they did use. They had no obvious weapons (except their poison gas spray) and seemed to be unable to cope with a locked door barring their way!! Also they struck me as rather insectile - quite organised but not too able to think creatively, even their speech sounded like crickets or something.As for the water thing - maybe they didn't KNOW that water was toxic to them.

And this movie is a let-down because I want so much to like it, but when I really think, it's not that good! The movie begins like somewhat of a black comedy. Norton is a white-collar office worker going through a state of depression in which he attends meetings with victims of various kinds of cancer. He befriends a testicular cancer patient named Bob (Meat Loaf) and discovers that a woman named Marla (Bonham-Carter) is going to all the same places.He meets Tyler Durden (Pitt) on a plane. Tyler owns his own soap business and from the start we know he's more than he says. Tyler and Edward Norton find therapy in beginning an underground bare-knuckle fight club in which men compete for fun and derive some sort of perverse pleasure from beating each other's brains in. The first few fights are actually somewhat entertaining, but as they progress they become more graphic and more tasteless. Tyler seems to disappear at one point and Norton is wondering what is going on as all the members of Fight Club begin to form some sort of underground army to challenge the establishment. Things grow frustrating while we keep trying to figure out what is going on. No one is acting right, not Marla, Bob, or anyone else. While not in the business of killing, these men plan to blow up several high-rise office-buildings while no one is in them. Norton tries to stop them. The final twist is a nice touch, but much of the movie is fighting and excess that could just as easily have been left out. We don't need to know that two men who are never fully developed lost their two front teeth in a brawl.

It is so delightfully comical and campy, like a B horror movie, yet delightfully witty and scary. The sequel, Gremlins 2, goes for more laughs than anything else, and comes off simply as an average, one-or-two-time-viewable summer flick.Billy (Zach Galligan) has since moved out of town, along with fiancée Phoebe Cates. They are now in New York City, working at Clamp Industries, headed by Clamp, a spoof on multiple political figures. Anywho. At his new office, Billy finds Gizmo, who has wondered from his home after Mr. Myagi - err, the Chinese man - died in the beginning of the film. He was picked up by some scientists, brought to Clamp, and then escaped to Billy's office, coincidentally. Well, Billy leaves him there for Cates to pick him up later. Unfortunately, Gizmo gets wet, and pretty soon a new breed of Gremlins have taken over the building, including a speaking Gremlin named Brain.Gremlins 2 is in no way as clever, fun, or humorous as the original. What is so ironic is that this sequel was supposed to go strictly for laughs, unlike the original, but I didn't laugh half as many times as I did the first time around while watching Gremlins.The jokes are not exactly re-hashed, but they are very dull. Yes, sometimes there are some big laughs, but I really expected more.Zach Galligan seems a little more full of himself in this sequel. Perhaps after the original he found success and figured he was a big shot. Ironically, he is now voicing computer games, and according to his attitude and comments on the DVD commentary with Joe Dante and cast, he seems to still think a lot of himself.Phoebe Cates is more beautiful in this film. She just looked average in the first, but something about her haircut matching her face in this film makes her look cute.Dick Miller, my favorite character - apart from Stripe - from the first film, returns, saying he was only injured by the snow plow. A cheap way of bringing back a character, yes. But I'm glad he's in it - he has more screen time in this film, and that's one good element of the movie.Director Joe Dante obviously had fun making this sequel, but it's nowhere near as good as the original. I'd probably be blaming the director of this film for how mediocre it is, but I can't muster up enough words to accuse Joe Dante, who made the original, that he is a bad director - the first film was excellent.But part of film critique is that you MUST criticize certain aspects of a lousy film, and while Gremlins 2 was in no way a LOUSY movie, it wasn't exactly a winner.Instead of putting thought into this absent-minded sequel, it seems the filmmakers single-handedly cashed in on the original's solid success. Instead of making something highly intelligent and thoughtful, Gremlins 2 comes out as a half-baked, summer sequel, whereas it could have been remembered as something more.Gremlins 2 is the kind of movie everyone is talking about before seeing it, and no one is talking about the next day.No, it's not horrible, and it's definitely worth seeing - especially if you're a fan of the original - but it's a major blow to the superior original.

Instead of making something highly intelligent and thoughtful, Gremlins 2 comes out as a half-baked, summer sequel, whereas it could have been remembered as something more.Gremlins 2 is the kind of movie everyone is talking about before seeing it, and no one is talking about the next day.No, it's not horrible, and it's definitely worth seeing - especially if you're a fan of the original - but it's a major blow to the superior original.

It is so delightfully comical and campy, like a B horror movie, yet delightfully witty and scary. The sequel, Gremlins 2, goes for more laughs than anything else, and comes off simply as an average, one-or-two-time-viewable summer flick.Billy (Zach Galligan) has since moved out of town, along with fiancée Phoebe Cates. They are now in New York City, working at Clamp Industries, headed by Clamp, a spoof on multiple political figures. Anywho. At his new office, Billy finds Gizmo, who has wondered from his home after Mr. Myagi - err, the Chinese man - died in the beginning of the film. He was picked up by some scientists, brought to Clamp, and then escaped to Billy's office, coincidentally. Well, Billy leaves him there for Cates to pick him up later. Unfortunately, Gizmo gets wet, and pretty soon a new breed of Gremlins have taken over the building, including a speaking Gremlin named Brain.Gremlins 2 is in no way as clever, fun, or humorous as the original. What is so ironic is that this sequel was supposed to go strictly for laughs, unlike the original, but I didn't laugh half as many times as I did the first time around while watching Gremlins.The jokes are not exactly re-hashed, but they are very dull. Yes, sometimes there are some big laughs, but I really expected more.Zach Galligan seems a little more full of himself in this sequel. Perhaps after the original he found success and figured he was a big shot. Ironically, he is now voicing computer games, and according to his attitude and comments on the DVD commentary with Joe Dante and cast, he seems to still think a lot of himself.Phoebe Cates is more beautiful in this film. She just looked average in the first, but something about her haircut matching her face in this film makes her look cute.Dick Miller, my favorite character - apart from Stripe - from the first film, returns, saying he was only injured by the snow plow. A cheap way of bringing back a character, yes.

As a `film' it is unworthy of such a thing on all levels. Do I detect an increase in the amount of documentaries that are given cinematic releases - pushed as `events'? It's a pity that for every Nick Broomfield, there's a `One Day In September' (seemingly designed to be light entertainment for Clancey readers; loving recreations of the final `shoot out' - and shot through with an appalling bias; check Edward Said's condemnations, first published in The Guardian newspaper). Here there are a couple of Lynchian flourishes (slow tracking through the beautiful-but-sinister front room of the protagonist, ominous rumbling on the soundtrack) but that's about it in terms of `cinema'. In terms of story, it's also something of a whitewash; in a timely fashion, even the `official version' of the truth doesn't make much sense. Plus there are things that can't be true (Evans claiming he had to woo Polanski to Hollywood for Rosemary's Baby) and are highly questionable (Evans basically claiming he was the brains behind The Godfather).The redeeming feature is the rare footage Polanski working on set, a Mike Nichols-directed 10 min promo that Evans used to ensure that Paramount didn't fire him and an amazing Hoffman improvisation on the set of Marathon Man. Hoffman does an unfunny comedy turn as Evans 20 years hence (ie in 1996) and gets EVERYTHING right - health probs, divorce, loss of business contacts etc.Titles at the end tell us that Evans has bounced back (shades of Alan Partridge?) and lists some of the most forgettable and unsuccessful films of recent years (Jade, Sliver...) to prove this. Then it says that Evans suffered a heart attack while pitching a film idea to Wes Craven! WES CRAVEN! And that he joked that There's never a dull moment around here while lying on the floor in agony. I mean...The only lesson is that talentless wannabes in the right place at the right time with the right people can facilitate something worth doing... but even then you get the sense that Evans was too useless to prevent Coppola making The Godfather in the way he did (anyone else would have of that mindset), evidenced by his overseeing of The Cotton Club and its disastrous postproduction and reception. Not only that, but the Evans films, as Time Out says of Love Story, were dated even before they were released... so he's not even worthy of the title hipster. Don't get me wrong, I'd be the first to work the bar with the man himself for several hours - and that's why the film fails we don't get the tarnished Golden Boy of Hollywood's great, last hedonistic period, rubbing a Gatsby sheen onto jaw-dropping anecdotes (of which there are many).
