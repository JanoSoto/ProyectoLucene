[{"date":"2 February 2009","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I heard of and seen the poster for this biographical comedy drama from director Milos Forman (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, Amadeus), I was looking forward to seeing it. Basically Andy Kaufman (Golden Globe winning Jim Carrey) was the eccentric comedian who grew to fame for performing Elvis impressions, then as Latka Gravas on stage, and then on the popular sitcom Taxi. But as his popularity grew, so did his desire to perform even more unconventional, bizarre and practically hated routines, stunts and performances, which concerns his manager George Shapiro (Danny DeVito, who knew the real Kaufman in Taxi, also producing the film). His various inside jokes, put-ons and happenings are seen not only on stage, but on Saturday Night Live, Late Night with David Letterman and Fridays. His long-running feud includes his self-declared Intergender Wrestling Champion of the world fights, plus wrestling with Jerry The King Lawler, and his portrayal of bawdy singer Tony Clifton. George, his creative partner Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti) and girlfriend Lynne Margulies (Courtney Love) are first unconvinced when he announces he has cancer, but of course he is telling the truth, and after his death, there are still questions as to whether he was a comedy genius or not. Also starring Vincent Schiavelli as ABC Executive Maynard Smith, Gerry Becker as Stanley Kaufman - Andy's Father, Peter Bonerz as Taxi Producer Ed. Weinberger, Greyson Erik Pendry as Little Michael Kaufman, Brittany Colonna as Baby Carol Kaufman, Leslie Lyles as Janice Kaufman - Andy's Mother, Bobby Boriello as Little Andy Kaufman and the real George Shapiro as Mr. Besserman. I can agree that the director makes you unsure of what to think of Kaufman, but of course this is the point, in real life, you never knew when the act stopped. Carrey gives a very convincing performance, DeVito, Giamatti and Love give good support, and with music and songs by R.E.M., including Man on the Moon (made in 1993, but it is about Kaufman) and The Great Beyond (written for the film), this is a very interesting film. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy\/Musical. Very good!

It wasn't until 2005 when I saw both of them in their entirety for the first time. After my first viewings, I definitely preferred this sequel, but since then, I've seen both of them again, and now I'm not so sure. Judging by the ratings here, it looks like the first one is more popular, but I don't know which one I think is the stronger of the two. Right now, I don't think either of them are classics, but still think they're both reasonable comedies, despite how silly they are.A year has gone by, and Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar are still doing their show, but Wayne wishes to get farther in life, and doesn't know how he would do it. One night, in his dream, he meets the spirit of Doors frontman Jim Morrison, who tells him that he is to organize a rock concert, and that if he books bands, they will come! Immediately after Wayne wakes up, he tells Garth about his dream, and they soon begin their planning for a music festival called Waynestock. Following Jim Morrison's instructions, they recruit Del Preston, the world's greatest roadie, to help them. Trying to organize the show turns out to be difficult, and for Wayne, it doesn't help that he is once again having trouble with his rock star girlfriend, Cassandra Wong. Her manager, Bobby Cahn, is trying to lure her away from Wayne, so she will leave Aurora and move to L.A.! One thing I like about this Wayne's World sequel is the concert premise, since I find big rock concerts fascinating. Like I said, this is a silly comedy, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad one. The second time I watched this 1993 comedy, I wasn't sure if it would be above average at first, but it improved. Neither movie is consistently hilarious, but both of them certainly have their moments. In Wayne's World 2, highlights I've found include the dubbed fight sequence between Wayne and Cassandra's father (can't seem to remember that from my first viewing, but it was a highlight of my second), and the Village People impersonation in the gay bar (which stood out for me during both viewings). Scenes with Garth and his new love interest can also be good for laughs, and there's definitely more (no need to mention it all).Sequels tend to be less popular than their predecessors. There are exceptions, but this is not one of them. On the other hand, it seems some people do like this one better than the original, and like said, I used to be one of them, but now I'm not sure. I might prefer this one to a very small degree, due to the premise, but the first time, I thought it was funnier than Wayne and Garth's first full-length adventure, but that didn't quite seem to be the case the second time. Nonetheless, 1 & 2 are both reasonable Saturday Night Live adaptations, better than Coneheads. Basically, Wayne's World 2 shows Wayne and Garth's usual antics once again, which are silly and obviously hated by some viewers, but if you're a fan of the two famous SNL characters, both films should make you laugh, at least in some parts, though you MIGHT prefer the characters in smaller doses.

Mel Brooks once called him the Franz Kafka of comedy, and it's not far from the truth. The guy crafts such agonizing and harrowing comedy out of neuroses and problems and just common familial and relationship and whatever dread that it's staggering to watch (seeing him recently it was even more free-form and stream-of-conscious than ever, like Kurt Vonnegut and Woody Allen in a Bowery bar telling penis jokes). But he also was, in his past, troubled and on drugs and alcohol and went to a therapist for years and so on, and finally kicked it for good in the early 90s (he even wrote a sprawling, scatter-shot tell-all book called The Other Great Depression). So, in 1995, he took the lead part in Drunks, and if it may seem like his performance as Jim is so spot on and incredible it's more than likely because he knows this character, maybe all too well.I go on about Lewis so much just because he's the character most on the edge, the one falling off amongst all these other AA people meeting in a Manhattan Church, that it's impossible to take your eyes off him when he shows up. Jim, who speaks very reluctantly to the couple of dozen people at the AA meeting, lost his wife to a brain aneurysm two years after becoming sober from booze and junk. Then he slipped and went back and at the time of the meeting he hasn't had a drink in several months. Right after this long and heartfelt confession he leaves and wanders the streets, tempted at first and finally giving in to his insatiable craving to whiskey and beer. While he goes from either bar to his apartment or on the streets for drugs the film cuts back to the AA meeting where other people share their experiences, some fatally tragic like the blackout guy, or Dianne Wiest's doctor, or Faye Dunaway's upper-class mother, or Sam Rockwell's seemingly regular guy, or even Parker Posey as an ex-hippie chick.Hell, even Calista Flockheart gives a showstopper of a performance, which is an indicator of how on top of things the actors are here. It is, if as a real liability, written and performed like a play, and it's broken up as a series of monologues inter-cut with Jim in his downward spiral mode. The good thing about director Peter Cohn's approach is that even if a monologue falls kind of flat- I actually didn't care much for Spalding Gray who sort of mumbled through his character's turn as the guy who just showed up not knowing it was an AA meeting in the basement of the church- it can cut back to Richard Lewis who, in particular in one later scene at a bar, lays it down to such a heartbreaking beat that you almost wish he was in a Bergman movie or something - or, for that matter, one of Woody Allen's serious films. He's that amazing here, whether it's just how he is or if it's a performance or whatever. It's an actor's movie, and for that it works well. Just don't watch it for anything fancy or flashy; it's slightly obscure for that reason, since it doesn't have a real star attached.

It took me some time to figure it all out. Well, there is this outstanding cinematography which I could never enjoy again in this quality. Combined with the editing all the pictures are more like music, very sensual and very attached to the characters' feelings and notions. Somehow a lot of the story is told by the images whereas the music is more subtle and only underlining what the images try to tell you. When it comes to storytelling, this film is very classical in a sense that we just follow Cpt. Willard's descriptions and we can only learn what he knows. So after a while we become his mate and begin to judge the things from his perspective. Well, he does some questionable things and we still do not know if he is really reliable, so we keep distance all the way. Finally, we are attracted and repelled by his weary appearance all the way, so here comes the suspense from. Really nice technique to keep the audience focused on the plot.

While some of the banter is sufficiently witty , some of the jokes and gags feel forced and awkward, especially in the second half of the movie.And that's exactly what gives the movie its power. For much of the second half takes place after a near suicide. As many people who've witnessed such a situation know, one way people deal with this is through awkward attempts at humor to lift the spirits of the person affected. Such mild and playful comedy in The Apartment, such as straining spaghetti through a tennis racket and a story of being shot in the knee, may not make for side-splitting laughs. But it does resonate with anyone who's had to cope with this sort of emergency.The crisis is thrust upon meek, agreeable C.C. Bud Baxter (Jack Lemmon), an ordinary premium accountant working at Consolidated Life insurance company (a not-too-subtle jab at Met Life). He is eager to leave his mind-numbing job amid a sea of desks and move up the ranks of the company.

He also effectively develops even the lesser characters so that they become endearing and enduring characters despite getting very little screen time.

Chuck Russell made the 1994 hit The Mask, Frank Darabont, who did a lot of effects scenes in this, went on to direct the Shawshak Redemption and The Green Mile, arguably the two best and most loved Stephen King adaptations. Looking at this, it's not hard to see why. It's obvious from the get go that the people involved in this see it as much more than just a horror sequel. This does what a good sequel should, deepening the backstory in a sensible way and expanding the battle ground between the hero and villain.This also has possibly the best cast of any 80s horror movie with Craig Wasson, Patricia Arquette and Laurence Fishburne all signing up. Of course Wasson and Fishburne were no names back then and Patricia Arquette, like Johnny Depp in Part I was taking on her first movie role. We also have Heather Leagankamp and John Saxon returning and Wes Craven involved in the creative process. Basically this one had no excuses, and as it turned out, didn't need any.The story here is that Freddy Krueger is continuing with his quest to wipe out teenagers and is currently having fun forcing a group of them into a mental institute through recurring nightmares, but his fun is interrupted as he targets Kristen (an adequate performance from Arquette), a girl with the ability to bring others into her nightmares. When Kristen is sent to the mental institute with the other teenagers, Nancy Thompson (Leagenkamp, the hero of the original) and she comes up with a plan to combat Freddy in dreamland by getting Kristen to drag all of the teenagers into one of her nightmares, where they will use their special dream abilities to take down Freddy.We are given further insight into Freddy's origins, he was conceived by a nun who worked at a mental asylum. And Craig Wasson is left in the real world to give Nancy's father (John Saxon) a chance at redemption, and giving the special effects guys the chance to do some walking bone shenanigans.In case you can't tell, I loved this movie. It is a standout not only in the nightmare series, but in 80s horror. There is nudity and sexual references, but this is a good movie that has aged well. Worth watching whether for the first, or hundredth time.

It's as if it had been cobbled together independently by several different intellects and sensibilities. It's not a particularly dumb movie, a pointless slasher product, despite its fashionably misspelled title. It's not a rerun of, say, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It's not arty either, not like, say, Badlands, although the people behind it must unquestionably have seen both earlier movies.Let me get an abstract of the story out of the way. A writer of stories about serial killers (David Duchovny) wants to travel out west to California with his photographer girl friend (Carrie Laughlin) and visit the scenes of mass murders, then write a book about them. To share expenses he agrees to take along two strangers, the bearded and vulgar Brad Pitt and his blowzy girl friend Juliette Lewis. Duchovny shouldn't have done it. Pitt turns out to be an exemplar of the type. There is a violent and gory climax.Each of the four main characters could be described in a couple of words, I suppose. Duchovny is the cheerfully tolerant, analytic writer who wants to get into the heads of serial killers but is happy enough to allow Pitt to liberate the occasional, well-controlled wild streak in him. (Grinning like a little boy, he lets Pitt show him how to shoot a pistol.) Laughlin is the snooty Eastern artist who is revolted by Pitt and Lewis and irritated by Duchovny's interest in them. Pitt is the hairy ape who spits all the time, wears a cap with a Confederate flag, whips his woman when she drinks or cusses, and takes the shoes off his smelly feet in a restaurant. Lewis is the nincompoop who believes that since Pitt rescued her from a gang bang years ago he's her savior and master. She's romantic to the point of delusion and more interested in her yo-yo than in Pitt's transgressions.As for character development, Laughlin and Pitt don't change at all, from beginning to end, only revealed. Duchovny's change is formulaic. The liberal finds that, under extreme circumstances, he can shoot and kill another human being because the script calls for it. Actually, Duchovny's character isn't very bright. When Pitt commits his first murder on the road, Duchovny peppers him with penetrating questions like, You didn't have to kill that guy. Why did you do it? For the power? Because he reminded you of your father? Really. Well, as Duchovny admitted earlier, all he knows about serial killers is from library books, and he's evidently read Freud. Juliette Lewis is the most interesting character. She's full of ums and ahs and other hesitations and her performance is informed by a childish excitement until, near the end, when her fundamental decency is awakened and she turns on Pitt. In turn, Pitt has a better grasp of the character than the one he showed in the popular Se7en, another insulting title. Here, he's nicely animated.I have to say that the photography is fine too, and so is the location shooting and the set dressing. These kinds of skills are often neglected because they form a kind of background to the figures in the foreground, but they're important skills nonetheless.For what it is -- and it doesn't really pretend to be more than what it is -- a story of two (or three, depending) innocents who are emotionally and physically savaged by a serial murderer -- it's not nearly as bad as it might be. Here's how bad it might be. A couple of simple-minded happy-go-lucky college kids on spring break pick up two venomous hitch hikers and after assorted mayhem, including a couple of student deaths and considerably nudity, one or two of the surviving students manage to slaughter the hitch hikers.

","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"2 February 2009","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The central idea of the classic con-trick movie, exemplified by 'The Sting' and perfected by David Mamet, is that there's always a bigger con; and the director usually tries conning the audience as well, convincing us we have finally understood what's going while retaining a trick up his sleeve. In fact, there have been so many such movies that at first 'Nine Queens', Fabien Bielinsky's effort in this genre, feels uncomfortable to watch, as it seems likely we are going to get a fairly standard assembly of trick-upon-trick more than once it explicitly acknowledges Mamet's 'House of Games'. But the film soon starts to redeem itself, when it becomes clear that the characters are also aware of the long con, and are all mutually suspicious of each other's intentions; the question is, who is playing the biggest trick?

Through a leisurely exposition between a happily married doctor and wife on a business trip in Paris, Polanski's camera at some stage begins to tell us things through ominous zoom-ins and steadicams. We see him thinking, wondering when he should start worrying. We are comfortably in the same perspective as Harrison Ford's protagonist. But this pace becomes an obstruction later on. This ironically low-key thriller's action is periodically interrupted by unnecessary scenes with no subtext, for example a dance sequence between the internally agitated Ford and Emmanuelle Seigner.It is a true paradox that pace is an issue for a film called Frantic. So much so that I wonder upon reflection if it was Polanski's intention to compress the briskness of the action to familiarize us with the protagonist's internalization of fear, worry and bewilderment. Whatever the answer is, it was not a conducive creative device.The first half is promising in large part because of Polanski's experience with the loss of his own wife to random circumstance with murderers. It made me feel as if I was going to see an intense, personal film that dealt with that eternally wounding part of his life, sadly one of the many. Alas, I didn't get that. Frantic is a formula suspense film easily pigeonholed with the rest of the 1980s Hollywood thrillers.The hero's essential obstacle being that he's a fish out of water, an American businessman in Paris who speaks no French and thus can hardly navigate his way through the city, much less a trail to his wife in which time is of the essence. The film would truly live up to a degree of tension if his interactions with Parisians were realistic. They all seem willing to help, none of them annoyed by an American archetype anxiously babbling English at them in their native country. I've heard many stories from friends and writers who've been to Paris. They do not bless Paris with a reputation for being nice and accommodating to English-speaking Americans. One friend told me that he was not allowed to have his passport back unless he asked for it in French. Another told me that when he tried to order a meal at a restaurant in English, the clerk slammed her hand on the table and ordered that he speak French. My own experience in Paris might be vastly different, and it is no doubt a beautiful and culturally rich city, but there would inevitably be at least a blemish of resistance against Ford's conventionally American character.There is, however, a great sense of the hero's naivété with danger or intrigue. The tone is never too tongue-in-cheek to diminish the tension of the narrative and never too pitiful to deprive him of his credibility as a serious dramatic character. There is a terrific scene in which he must enter a woman's apartment from the outside ledge through a diagonal window. He must carry a satchel with important contents. He is also a well-fed middle-aged American doctor who never thought by any stretch of the imagination that a simple business trip would require him to do this. There is a not-so-good scene that suggests the same thing, but leaves us with a major story gap, during a scene at an airport where he's scared that the contraband-sniffing dogs will discover the dope in the suitcase. The dogs don't, and yet not only does Ford appear to have forgotten about at least a gram of coke in his pocket, the police dogs don't notice either.Generally, Frantic is a genre film with genre conventions the dubious female companion, the inept American intelligence agents, American paranoia concerning terrorism and a predictable ending that was only unpredictable to me because I felt sure that Polanski would take bolder steps. It is nevertheless an entertaining movie, but not a riveting one and not particularly memorable.

This overcooked multi-million-dollar Western epic is dripping with its excesses &#150; the music is loud and sweeping, the melodrama is almost operatic, and the dazzling Technicolor palette is a feast for the eyes. When Selznick gives us a sunset, he damn well gives us a SUNSET! Such an achievement, guided by the producer's fastidious tastes, demanded the efforts of no less than seven directors, including Selznick himself, though only King Vidor received on screen credit; William Dieterle, Josef von Sternberg and William Cameron Menzies were among the filmmakers whose efforts were disposed of during the course of production. 'Duel in the Sun' might also be the most epic two-hour film I've ever seen. The story covers an extraordinary amount of ground, and the vivid cinematic style, making copious use of close-ups, is occasionally prescient of Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns.Then there's the cast, of course. Jennifer Jones plays Pearl Chavez, a half-breed Injun who is invited to live on a respected Texas ranch after her father (Herbert Marshall) murders his unfaithful wife and her lover. Pearl's ethnicity is shamelessly exploited to perpetuate the stereotype that Native Americans inherently possess some sort of uncontrollable base sexuality; Pearl spends most of the film fighting to keep her clothes on, and she is instinctively drawn to Lewt (Gregory Peck), a downright bastard with almost adolescent sexual urges. Joseph Cotten plays the selfless McCanles brother, and Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymore (probably the only Hollywood actor to carry on a prolific career from a wheelchair) are excellent as the owners of the ranch. The cast is rounded off nicely by Charles Bickford as a genial rancher, and Walter Huston, who hilariously overplays his role as a preacher (The Sinkiller) and steals every scene. Indeed, most of the performers overplay their roles, perhaps recognising that the story (adapted from a novel by Niven Busch) would not work if played entirely straight.What I found most interesting about 'Duel in the Sun' is how, even as early as 1946, it subverted the traditional notions of honour and nobility that formed the backbone of the Western genre. Joseph Cotten's character remains the film's only decent male, and yet he is dismissed mid-way through the film, and must settle on marrying a woman who is far less sensuous and exciting than Pearl Chavez.

If the film's intention was to present Pearl's struggle for acceptance into honourable white society, then she nevertheless ends the film as she started, stranded between conflicting instincts and emotions that she can't control.

We follow closely a group of Marine trainees as they pass through many tests in order to become one of the Corps. For the first 45 minutes or so, the drama is unparalleled. On an island totally dominated by an unflinching and cruel drill instructor, these young boys quickly are forced to grow up and become the mindless and dehumanized killers the Marines require.

Unfortunately, they discover that what they have trained for is to simply survive and this is the part where you might just be unable to peel your eyes from the action. If you have seen any war film before, you know how realistic and brutal the action scenes can be. Kubrick, perhaps the greatest atmospheric director ever, plunges us into the middle of an attack on Hue City as well as sneak attacks and other very real and very scary situations.I have to say this is a very unique war film in terms of American cinema. Being the most powerful country in the last half century, our position in any war usually affects the outcome. This is certainly the case in movies like Saving Private Ryan or Platoon.

","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"2 February 2009","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" After watching this during a surreal snow storm outside, I can honestly say I have thought more about this review than any other. Not that my brain has been damaged by the amount of booze consumed during last night's Superbowl, oh no. Nor is it due to a particular fondness for Juliette Binoche. You see, in terms of cinematic value, this is a breath-taking exercise in film-making. Every shot feel lovingly crafted, every line of dialogue is poetry and the editing is some of the best I have seen. It's just that, in terms of entertainment, I personally found it uninvolving at times and a bit dull. Call me what you will but on some levels, it just didn't work.Adapted from the acclaimed novel by Milan Kundera, The Unbearable Lightness Of Being takes us back to Prague in the days before Soviet occupation. Care-free surgeon Tomas (Daniel Day-Lewis) spends his days sleeping around, usually with his bohemian artist lover Sabina (Lena Olin) and occasionally doing some work when he's not chatting up the nurses. After being sent to a nearby town to treat a patient, he meets the beautiful Tereza (Binoche) and against his will, Tomas falls for her after she follows him back to Prague. Gradually, Tereza and Tomas are accepted by Sabina and the three strike an unusual friendship - a friendship forever altered by the dramatic invasion of the Soviet forces and their subsequent emigration to Switzerland.I'm still not sure exactly where I stand on this film. Feeling reminiscent of Lust, Caution (which isn't a bad yardstick, as things go), there is not a single frame of this picture that looks anything less than beautiful despite the occasionally bleak subject matter. Olin and Binoche are brilliant but strangely, Daniel Day-Lewis lets the side down. He comes across as a selfish, manipulative dandy and I found it difficult to emphasise with him. I also felt he looked like Ben Stiller going through college and once that thought was there, it stuck! The supporting cast, largely unknown to most English-speaking audiences, were all faultless and deserve as much credit as the director for creating a sublime, smouldering masterpiece. The story also had its moments where it was genuinely upsetting but for the most part, it lacked any sort of narrative. It seemed to wander at will, from country to country, with little to link it like a bad James Bond movie. It also isn't as controversial as it would like you to believe - the sex, while moderately graphic, isn't a patch on what we see in mainstream movies today. This is no Monster's Ball.Maybe I'm missing something. At times, I felt like the movie was talking to me on a different intellectual plain that I couldn't understand and the fact that a lot of dialogue seems to be whispered didn't help - I needed the DVD's subtitles, that's for sure. It doesn't confuse you like Donnie Darko did but instead tests every sinew of attention as there's every chance that a small but vital line is missed or overlooked. So I'm afraid that The Unbearable Lightness Of Being didn't float my boat as I was hoping it would but it is a glorious, beautiful film which looks and sounds the business (despite its age) but doesn't offer much in the way of entertainment. Personally, I think that Secretary is a better kooky and controversial romance than this is or even Binoche's other legendary skin-flick Damage. This is more high-brow, thoughtful and European than that though and if you like a challenge then this could be the film for you. ","genre":null},{"date":"2 February 2009","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" After watching this during a surreal snow storm outside, I can honestly say I have thought more about this review than any other. Not that my brain has been damaged by the amount of booze consumed during last night's Superbowl, oh no. Nor is it due to a particular fondness for Juliette Binoche. You see, in terms of cinematic value, this is a breath-taking exercise in film-making. Every shot feel lovingly crafted, every line of dialogue is poetry and the editing is some of the best I have seen. It's just that, in terms of entertainment, I personally found it uninvolving at times and a bit dull. Call me what you will but on some levels, it just didn't work.Adapted from the acclaimed novel by Milan Kundera, The Unbearable Lightness Of Being takes us back to Prague in the days before Soviet occupation. Care-free surgeon Tomas (Daniel Day-Lewis) spends his days sleeping around, usually with his bohemian artist lover Sabina (Lena Olin) and occasionally doing some work when he's not chatting up the nurses. After being sent to a nearby town to treat a patient, he meets the beautiful Tereza (Binoche) and against his will, Tomas falls for her after she follows him back to Prague. Gradually, Tereza and Tomas are accepted by Sabina and the three strike an unusual friendship - a friendship forever altered by the dramatic invasion of the Soviet forces and their subsequent emigration to Switzerland.I'm still not sure exactly where I stand on this film. Feeling reminiscent of Lust, Caution (which isn't a bad yardstick, as things go), there is not a single frame of this picture that looks anything less than beautiful despite the occasionally bleak subject matter. Olin and Binoche are brilliant but strangely, Daniel Day-Lewis lets the side down. He comes across as a selfish, manipulative dandy and I found it difficult to emphasise with him. I also felt he looked like Ben Stiller going through college and once that thought was there, it stuck! The supporting cast, largely unknown to most English-speaking audiences, were all faultless and deserve as much credit as the director for creating a sublime, smouldering masterpiece. The story also had its moments where it was genuinely upsetting but for the most part, it lacked any sort of narrative. It seemed to wander at will, from country to country, with little to link it like a bad James Bond movie.

The film begins with the D-Day landing before moving on to a mission with the express purpose of retrieving a private whose three brothers have recently fallen in combat.The story is loosely based on a similar case involving four brothers by the name of Niland. However, Robert Rodat's screenplay also uses Ryan to represent the unknown individuals that these soldiers risked (and often lost) their lives for. The script is occasionally clumsy in its attempts at profundity but not enough to be a major distraction.The cast is a varied and well-assembled lot. Tom Hanks secured the film's only Oscar nomination in the acting categories but the entire cast upholds a high standard of workmanship. Even actors whom I usually don't care for, such as Edward Burns and Vin Diesel, deliver performances that fit in seamlessly with their peers and their surroundings. As a result, I have to credit the casting director with finding the right actors for the right parts.Spielberg's direction won him his second Oscar in that category and is everything that you would expect from him. The first twenty or so minutes in particular (the D-Day landing) is riveting while Spielberg continually shows himself capable of handling all situations and settings with aplomb. Of course, this wouldn't be a Spielberg film without a John Williams score. Williams contributes a fine score here, if not quite reaching the same lofty heights as his very best work.All things considered, Saving Private Ryan is quite an achievement. It boggles the mind that Shakespeare in Love beat this for the Best Picture Oscar. Surely that is a snub to go down in history along with the likes of Raging Bull & Apocalypse Now.
