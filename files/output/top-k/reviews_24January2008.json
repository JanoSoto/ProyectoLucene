Even in looking for actors playing the roles of CLARICE STARLING and HANNIBAL LECTER has been a great difficulty for the production.

With such advanced technology nowadays, these special features can be made real without any difficulties.Although I really did not enjoy the movie (probably the unforgettable bloody scene have created a bad image for me), I would recommend this movie to those who enjoy bloody thrillers, as the violent scenes will leave you nightmares lasting at least a month.

Yes, Jurassic Park vastly surpasses Congo in quality, but seeing as how the former is debatedly THE best example of a summer action flick, making that statement doesn't necessarily mean that Congo isn't worth watching.In fact, Congo is a breathtaking thriller, probably only marred by its budget which causes some of the effects to look rather cheap, and descend into the B-movie territory. That being said, director Frank Marshall still manages to not only create a film that not only succeeds as an action film, but at times the tension grows so high that it almost could be labeled as a horror flick (though I highly doubt that that was the intent).Yet there is some justification in labeling Congo as a horror film (at least in part). There are definitely some moments, particularly in the latter half of the movie, that are actually quite frightening. While the killer gorillas don't necessarily look scary up close, the savagery in which they attack and brutally murder people is pretty scary. In addition, the gore level is pretty high, especially for a PG-13 rating. The efforts on the part of the filmmakers to avoid an R rating is at times obvious, such as in some of the more brutal gorilla attacks, the picture is fuzzy and in slow-motion (these changes are not successful, and hurt the movie). Even as it is, the levels of terror and gore are high enough to make one wonder whether the PG-13 rating is appropriate.Congo is not without its flaws. As I said before, the budget constraints make some of the effects look cheap, and at times lower the film to the B-level range. Also, the film takes a little too long to begin gaining momentum, which at times cause the film to drag (though the payoff in the latter half of the movie is well worth the wait). Finally, it is quite clear that Amy is a person in a gorilla suit (which given the complexity of the character was unavoidable). The killer gorillas don't suffer from the same fate, but they don't look particularly frightening (actually, they look rather sickly, however their actions quickly quash that notion).Frequently, acting is not a strong point for most action-adventure films, unless the characters are rather unique (as in Pirates of the Caribbean).

It's all in the delivery, and Hudson delivers his lines with enough wit and bite to make him easily the most appealing actor in the movie. Had this movie been more popular, it would be reasonable to suspect that Hudson could have been up for an Oscar, as most of the nominees of the said award win for inferior performances. Laura Linney and Dylan Walsh are adequate, but given the staple hero characters they are given, it is probably unfair to expect more than what they give. Grant Heslov plays the neurotic sidekick that he usually plays (see True Lies), and it is pretty welcoming.I don't understand why this flopped at the box-office.

Somehow I found Nic Cage's character off-putting. Way off-putting. Then the plot didn't seem to make sense. Then by the end of the credits, the question came to mind What point was this movie making? What was it saying? The answer, unfortunately, was not much, if anything. I really don't think this movie aimed at making a statement; unless it was your life is your life, you're gonna make the same mistakes no matter what, so keep your eye upon the doughnut, and not the hole. Not a very profound statement, and I'm sorry, not profoundly made in this movie. The writing simply isn't that good. The direction is uneven, and is strangely overblown at times. Kathleen Turner was the best, and in my opinion, only worthwhile thing in this movie, and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre, unexplained circumstances, with a script that had no apparent statement to make. She also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason I didn't enjoy this movie more. She states in her autobiography that Cage made a point of fighting his uncle Coppola's direction every step of the way, doing it his own way (not a good idea for a new actor), and putting on a goofy voice she called stupid. His voice was annoying, abrasive and unnatural, and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy. I understand what he was attempting to do play a young-guy hot shot who is not as hot as he thinks he is, setting up his own karma for future failure. But he goes overboard, the way he does it is abrasive, not effective, and if he had listened to his uncle instead of fighting the Man, we would have had a more enjoyable film. Cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person, and those scenes are more watchable than others. But if I had to watch the movie through in its entirety, I would find myself wanting to pay someone in L.A. to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected (put-on) scenes. The movie doesn't aim for a statement, doesn't make a point, is great to look at except when Cage is doing a demented Elvis impression (but without the voice), and is, ultimately, confusing and a waste of time. Given all this, Kathleen Turner surely deserved an Oscar in this flailing mess of a movie. I can't recommend anyone spending two hours watching this, unless you like Turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes. Believe me, you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes, and it will make just as much sense. Kathleen Turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her Cage comments, which proves that she's strong enough to be honest, and to hell with other people's comments. You go, Turner! I'm not particularly a fan of this actress any more than I am of any other first-rate actor or actress, but her candor is refreshing. Cage's acting can be good to annoying, and here it doesn't work.

Somehow I found Nic Cage's character off-putting. Way off-putting. Then the plot didn't seem to make sense. Then by the end of the credits, the question came to mind What point was this movie making? What was it saying? The answer, unfortunately, was not much, if anything. I really don't think this movie aimed at making a statement; unless it was your life is your life, you're gonna make the same mistakes no matter what, so keep your eye upon the doughnut, and not the hole. Not a very profound statement, and I'm sorry, not profoundly made in this movie. The writing simply isn't that good. The direction is uneven, and is strangely overblown at times. Kathleen Turner was the best, and in my opinion, only worthwhile thing in this movie, and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre, unexplained circumstances, with a script that had no apparent statement to make. She also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason I didn't enjoy this movie more. She states in her autobiography that Cage made a point of fighting his uncle Coppola's direction every step of the way, doing it his own way (not a good idea for a new actor), and putting on a goofy voice she called stupid. His voice was annoying, abrasive and unnatural, and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy. I understand what he was attempting to do play a young-guy hot shot who is not as hot as he thinks he is, setting up his own karma for future failure. But he goes overboard, the way he does it is abrasive, not effective, and if he had listened to his uncle instead of fighting the Man, we would have had a more enjoyable film. Cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person, and those scenes are more watchable than others. But if I had to watch the movie through in its entirety, I would find myself wanting to pay someone in L.A. to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected (put-on) scenes. The movie doesn't aim for a statement, doesn't make a point, is great to look at except when Cage is doing a demented Elvis impression (but without the voice), and is, ultimately, confusing and a waste of time. Given all this, Kathleen Turner surely deserved an Oscar in this flailing mess of a movie. I can't recommend anyone spending two hours watching this, unless you like Turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes. Believe me, you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes, and it will make just as much sense. Kathleen Turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her Cage comments, which proves that she's strong enough to be honest, and to hell with other people's comments. You go, Turner!

Betsy goes to a progressive, unconventional school while Arlene attends a strict Catholic academy. One day, as Betsy accompanies Arlene on a school field trip to the White House, the young gals go off on their own, end up in forbidden territory and breach security by walking into a sensitive room unannounced. President Nixon (Dan Hedaya) realizes that the girls may have seen something compromising to his administration and he asks Betsy and Arlene to be his secret youth advisers. The teens, totally unaware that they really saw anything special, are thrilled, as they often get invited to talk with the president in the oval office. However, one night at the Watergate, where Arlene lives, they stumble across G. Gordon Liddy running down the back stairs, showing a very bad attitude toward the teens. Things start to add up, especially when Liddy tells the Prez he saw them and cars start to follow and nearly run into the girls. The teens decide to contact the Washington Post where Bob Woodward (Will Ferrell) and Carl Bernstein are eager to hear a tale but are embarrassed that their deep throats are two young females. Can Betsy and Arlene really relate anything important to bring down the Commander in Chief? This is a highly comedic look at Nixon, the Watergate affair, and what might have happened behind the scenes to topple Tricky Dick. As the girls, Dunst and Williams are wonderfully funny and appropriately dizzy, at times, while Hedaya is a scream as the uber-paranoiac President. The rest of the cast is also downright inspired, with Ferrell just one of the many fine players. A special commendation should go to Len Doncheff, who plays Leonid Breshnev, in one of the film's funniest scenes, where he tries the pot-laced cookies Betsy has graciously brought for everyone to sample. But, even down to the smallest roles, this is a cast to savor forever. The costumes are great examples of that seventies look and the scenery in and about the nation's capital very fine indeed. Needless to say, however, the sharp, politically-charged but very humorous script is the big, big winner. Even if you were among Nixon's strongest admirers, you will chuckle over this preposterous but hilarious take on the downfall of the only President to ever resign. All others will be rolling on the floor as this classic comedy plays itself to completion.

This film is highly over-rated. It is not really a screwball comedy at all, but simply a farce. The plot device of mistaken identities is probably older than Shakespeare, but to apply this device to two LEOPARDS coincidentally on the loose in the same New England locale is preposterous! In fact, the premise that somebody could actually just ship a live leopard, as if it were some stuffed toy, directly to a private address in the United States is beyond credulity to begin with, thus completely undermining the rest of this farce. True screwball comedy doesn't rely on such completely impossible plot devices - unlikely ones, maybe, but impossible ones, no!In BUB, Kate Hepburn is so annoying, that it is impossible for me to see how Cary Grant could possibly fall for her. Both Hepburn and Grant seem absorbed in their own eccentric characters. They seem to be acting in separate vacuums, instead of developing any palpable affection. In order to convince me that they are truly falling for one another, they needed to develop a lot more chemistry as the film progressed. Whatever chemistry they do have reflects conflict, not growing affection. In the end Grant seems to succumb to Hepburn with an air of weary resignation - not love! (That's, okay, Cary; she wore me down, too!) The love story is lost in all of the buffoonery and unbelievable antics and then seemingly tacked on as an afterthought.In fairness to Hepburn, I enjoyed seeing her portray the madcap heiress, even if she doesn't really convince me of her growing love for Grant. And Grant's Harold Lloyd knock-off is rather interesting - but more peculiar than funny. This film would have worked better with a real character - not a parody. In the truly classic screwball comedies, one of the main characters is loopy - not both. With both leads portrayed as nuts, there is nothing to ground this movie.Given the unbelievability of the plot, the writing is quite good. The dialog is very good; that part of the film is up to the standards of its contemporaries - both comedies and dramas. But to call this a screwball comedy is an affront to true screwball comedies.

The poor dog is suffering from a number of injuries including a vicious gash over his left eye and the veterinary cost to bring him back to good health are just too much from the Prestons. Having re-financed his home to pay the family's bills another mouth to feed is the last thing that the hard working and money strapped Ray Preston needs.As Marty tries to convince his parents to keep Shiloh as the family pet the matter of keeping or not keeping the cute little beagle is suddenly cleared up with local hunter Judd Travers, Scott Wilson, showing up in the film. It turns out that Shiloh, or dog # 5 as Judd calls him, ran away from Judd's kennel where he keeps his pack dogs that he uses to hunt game; raccoons possum and rabbits.Marty is forced by his dad to give Shiloh, who's since become very attached to him, back to the hard driving and abusive Judd Travers where Shiloh ends up being again brutally beaten and kicked around this time within an inch of his life. Shiloh escaping for the second time from the Judd house has Marty, whom Shiloh came limping back to, now more determined then ever to keep the dog no matter what it takes! Even if he has to work himself to death to make enough money to buy Shiloh off of Judd Travers' hands.The film Shiloh is far better then your average Boy and his Dog Walt Disney-like flick in its depiction of the grown ups as well as young people in it.

Travers not only let Shiloh, who legally belonged to him, go back to the Prestons but completely change his attitude about man's best friend as well. It also took the hard work and sacrifice by Marty, in working his butt off for Judd, to get Judd to appreciate what a powerful bond Marty and Shiloh had between themselves. Trying to stiff Marty out of the bargain, or verbal agreement, that he made with him in getting Shiloh back Judd tried to pull a fast one in nullifying the contract, that had no sighed witnesses, he had with Marty. It was when Judd saw how Shiloh acted as he was driving him back to his dog kennel and, with the badly injured Shiloh really no use to him as a hunting dog, curtain death Judd finally saw the light and let his heart, not his business mind, take over.

The poor dog is suffering from a number of injuries including a vicious gash over his left eye and the veterinary cost to bring him back to good health are just too much from the Prestons. Having re-financed his home to pay the family's bills another mouth to feed is the last thing that the hard working and money strapped Ray Preston needs.As Marty tries to convince his parents to keep Shiloh as the family pet the matter of keeping or not keeping the cute little beagle is suddenly cleared up with local hunter Judd Travers, Scott Wilson, showing up in the film. It turns out that Shiloh, or dog # 5 as Judd calls him, ran away from Judd's kennel where he keeps his pack dogs that he uses to hunt game; raccoons possum and rabbits.Marty is forced by his dad to give Shiloh, who's since become very attached to him, back to the hard driving and abusive Judd Travers where Shiloh ends up being again brutally beaten and kicked around this time within an inch of his life. Shiloh escaping for the second time from the Judd house has Marty, whom Shiloh came limping back to, now more determined then ever to keep the dog no matter what it takes! Even if he has to work himself to death to make enough money to buy Shiloh off of Judd Travers' hands.The film Shiloh is far better then your average Boy and his Dog Walt Disney-like flick in its depiction of the grown ups as well as young people in it. Everyone in the movie including the at first despicable Judd Travers have their good as well, especially with Judd, as bad points in how they deal with the realities of life. In this case the treatment of the star of the film sweet little Shiloh.

It pains me deeply to watch a poorly cast main actor, whose name is so forgettable, unlike John Travolta, and a memorable Michelle Pfieffer whose role is doesn't even hold water - the chewing gum girl. However the single greatest mistake in this movie is the Producer's decision to forget the importance that in a musical, musical writers are the ticket to a great movie. The second mistake they made was to change the director from Randal Kleiser to a Patricia Birch. The formula of successes for Robert Stigwood in Saturday Night Live was the Bee Gees, and for Grease 1, it was John Farrar, Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey. However, it was John Farrar's music that stole the show for Grease 1. In Grease 2 the only great music that comes from the entire sad movie was Reproduction, which turns out to be a comedy than a real musical. Assuming the relative interesting music, I believe just only one to be unique for Grease 2, while for Grease 1, you got Hopelessly Devoted to You, Summer Nights, Grease, You're the One that I want, and Grease Lightning. Grease 1 had 5 great hits, while only one not so great Reproduction, from then on the value of musical is not even any interesting. With poor scripts, bad casting, and a forgotten talented music writers, the movie is painful for me to watch. Way back in the 1950s, they proudly promoted their musical writers, such as Rodgers and Hammerstein, and the hits were consistent with the talent of the musical writer, such as Oklahoma!, King and I, The Sound of Music, South Pacific, and then some. Then we have the enduring Henry Mancini, Breakfast at Tiffany's, Pink Panther, and other memorable movies just by the weight of the musicians. The producers such as Robert Stigwood basically got lucky, but didn't learn from any of their success, which I think was fluke, despite bad scripts from Saturday Night Fever, but didn't seem to learn from their success, and seems to go downhill. So in case I am wondering why Grease 2 failed, it failed in most every aspect that it is still a pain to watch that forgettable what's his face, British Actor, and somewhat uninteresting Michelle Pfieffer miscast and the lack of any chemistry between the two. Still it can be salvaged and become a hit, if the producers simply didn't toss away John Farrar, Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey like feminine napkins. If anyone thinks Grease 2 was poorly budgeted, its budget was 13,000,000 compared to Grease 1 where its budget is halved that at 6,000,000. So it is likely that they didn't care about the quality of music in a musical. If you want to watch a good musical, I think Grease 1, Chicago, Hairspay, Saturday Night Fever and Sound of Music would be it. But if you just wanted to see the movie without the need for any music and a Michelle Pfieffer fans, or what's his face main actor, then Grease 2 is better. All in all, I would like to give a 1, but decided to give 2 out of 10 for this because the title Grease 2 is a good one, other than that, there is no redeeming likeness Grease 1 other than the fact that it was done by the same Producers, who short-sightedness barely made any money from this mistake.

But not this time.After a nice, slow, atmospheric rendezvous in a wonderfully-sleazy Parisian location, things begin to build quickly.It's a well-worn theme. A group of mercenaries are recruited to do something dangerous. They've been doing it since 'The Magnificent Seven'. Unlike that movie, non of the characters are evaluated in depth. They're tough individuals; that's enough. Each is self-employed in dangerous - almost certainly criminal - games. They're naturally suspicious and wary of too much familiarity. They may have to kill one another. And eventually they do. It's ruthless, cold-blooded and shockingly indiscriminate when it happens. The public get no quarter either. We sample only enough of their natures to keep the plot moving, which is something I like. There's non of the maudlin, peripheral, and largely irrelevant self-indulgence with which Hollywood so routinely spoils itself. Indeed, quite the contrary. During a couple of takes we almost relish their ruthless indifference a child threatened with assassination, and an 'auction' of wits in which an ice-skater is the prize or the price. There are nice little cameos of conflict too. I liked the character of Sean Bean; an inexperienced bravado punching way beyond his weight, and who, sickened by the consequences, is rejected. Or there's Natascha McElhone's 'Deirdre' steadfast and vixenish, always on the edge of a flaring confrontation. A good-looking woman who can actually act, and isn't just along for some eye-candy. All of the players prove more than equal to the limited depth required of them. I didn't spot a bad egg in the carton.There really isn't time for sentiment here; this movie is too often on the move. Emotion flickers occasionally - an injured or murdered companion, a little sexual chemistry - but otherwise fasten your seat-belts.Car-chases set a new standard in headlong ferocity. Forget 'Bullitt', Forget 'The Italian Jobs', forget 'The French Connection'; this is where it's at. The shooting is cut and edited to perfection. They really are edge of the seat. They're also set in interesting French locations instead of the usual humdrum San Francisco.The plot is convoluted. There's a lot of 'Mission Impossible' or even 'Harry Palmer' type double-cross. The twists are unexpected and keep you guessing. This movie does not assume you're a couch-potato, but still always manages to keep one step ahead of your expectations. A director smarter than his audience - how refreshing is that? Full marks to Mr Frankenheimer.Music and sound-effects mesh well with the visual imagery. It seems a small thing, but how often has a potentially good movie been screwed-up by such inattention to detail?The script, however, isn't particularly clever. Some of the verbal exchanges, especially those involving Robert DeNiro are actually pretty crass. There are no memorable one-liners. But it's the final denouement that's the real turkey. Jean Reno's rather clichéd little summary is completely unnecessary. An actor of his class could say as much with his facial expression and body language.

With a few famous faces (Drew Barrymore, James Woods, Robert Hays and Alan King), this is a funny, suspenseful and a mostly well-made movie. Of note is the constant references to King's other work. In the opening scenes the cat is chased by a bloody St. Bernard (Cujo) and runs in front of a red car with a bumper sticker stating 'I'm Christine' (obviously Christine...). In the segment Quitters Inc. a character is watching The Dead Zone and proceeds to say 'who writes this crap?' In the last segment The General a woman is reading Pet Semetary. All these references should make any King fan giggle and realise this movie is very tongue-in-cheek.The first segment Quitters Inc. is the best of the three (the short story is also extremely good). James Morrison (James Woods) decides to give up smoking by joining Quitters Inc. but at first finds their methods cruel and sadistic. Can he go along with their twisted game or will he fall to temptation? Also starring Alan King, this segment is at times funny and at times creepy with an ending sure to shock.The second segment The Ledge is the second best of the three and is darkly funny. Johnny Norris (Robert Hays) becomes involved with a dangerous man, Cressner (Kenneth McMillian), who loves to wager. However, this particular one is rather twisted. The wager is, if Norris can climb around a ledge at the top of an apartment building he gets money, freedom and his girl. People with fears of heights will hate this segment as the majority of it is filmed up high and at times is very tense. Although in some scenes the special effects look rather dated this one is still a great watch.The last and weakest segment The General with Drew Barrymore is about a troll who lives in the girl's bedroom and tries to steal her breath. However, the cat who we've been following is by her side, trying to protect her. I found this segment to be the worst. I found the story silly and uninteresting, the special effects were bad and it wasn't at all scary or funny.But I don't want to end this review on a bad note because this movie was very watchable and a very faithful King adaptation.

Rowling did a good job in writing the story but the movie makes no sense at all. All the plots are not linked up. The characters are bad. Daniel Radcliffe is a very bad actor. Many other better actors could be chosen. I think he was chosen just because he looks like the Harry Potter on the front cover of the book. The costumes are bad. The special effects are bad. The entire movie is not bad but very very very bad.If you want to learn about the Harry Potter stories, go straight ahead to the book, but definitely not the movie.

The City of Lost Children weaves together two very different stories. In one we see a scientist's flawed experiments (clones, an immensely short woman, a brain with no body and most importantly, Krank the mad scientist who can't dream) and in the other we see the story of One and Miette, a circus strongman and a young girl who combine forces to get One's little brother back from Cyclops who stole him so that Krank can harvest his dreams. Both of these stories were immensely compelling in their own way. The story of the experiments was darkly humorous and original, and featured a sensational performance from Dominique Pinon as the clones. And on the other side, there's the story of One and Miette which was absolutely adorable and engaging. I loved the strong friendship between these two characters and the complexity of both of them. Ron Perlman gave a very strong performance, but the young Judit Vittet gave the best of the film and one of my favorites of all time. As always with Jeunet, the film is shot wonderfully with some phenomenal cinematography and he proved that he could master science-fiction with some of the best art direction I've ever seen. A darkly humorous, strangely adorable masterpiece.
