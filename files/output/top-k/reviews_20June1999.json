Only a few survived, and Beastmaster was one of them.It was by 1984 that the Sword and Sorcery genre died down, and Hollywood was moving on fast to the action genre, which I blame Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, and Hollywood thinking, 'Wouldn't it be cool if we mixed every genre there is, with  action, and make them extreamly violent, and no brainer, so the audience don't have to think about it'?  Which I think is still happening right now.The only film to come out way after 1984 to be a hit with the action hungry audience was Highlander (1986), even though there was a lot of swords (and too was excellent), there was no sorcery.It's a shame Hollywood don't make Sword and Sorcery films anymore, I know that there's Xena and Herculies, but they are just a 90's version of the 60's Batman, all tongue and cheek, and no heart to the genre.Beastmaster captured the essence of the genre, without going sickly, when the animals that become his friends and help him fight against the baddies.The sequels to the Beastmaster are not up to scratch, but I recommend this film to everyone, it's an excellent film.Enjoy!

I have followed all the actors movies and Simon West went all out on this movie. All the way from camera angles to lighting and casting this movie stands above all his others. This powerful movie delivers not just an all-star cast of actors but a actual plot that gets you involved as a viewer, gives you chills, and brings reality to a higher level.Travolta brings to the screen a top notch performance and brings his character to life in this masterpiece. Along with his star cast of James Woods, Madeleine Stowe, and James Cromwell just to name a few. Woods brought his finest work out in this movie by bringing his character to perfection. Even he himself knows he did by watching over again the scene of Travolta and himself trying to outsmart each other in the first meeting they have. This scene will give you chills alone. This film was put together in fine style and has you at the edge of your seat from start to finish. No hour long intro of what the plot is either. From the start you are drawn in by sheer drama and action. And there is more than a handful of laughs in this as well. By far I rate this in my top ten and is worth a second viewing. The ending alone is nothing what you expect let alone what you think might happen. You find yourself watching this movie asking what is going to happen next and asking who you are with yo do you think it is. I give this movie my superior rating. You will not be disappointed at this movie. 4 stars to Simon West because this movie has action, drama, suspense, comedy, and is a true thriller. Two thumbs up!

Tonight I saw the best film I've ever seen. I saw Office Space. It's sooooo good I could go on and on about it for the rest of my life, and still I'd only have time to tell you about one tenth of everything that's absolutely superb in this movie. So I'll have to be pretty selective.Mike Judge (I'm thinkin' about calling him god from now on !!) is the man behind Office Space. He has written and directed it. Previously he has given the world (among other things) the animated TV-series Beavis and Butt-Head that I really love. But since I was a bit disappointed with his first feature Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, my expectations weren't high on this one. But with Office Space he delivers excellence. Office Space doesn't have the same type of humor as in Beavis and Butt-Head. Not to say that this film isn't funny, because it is. It's hilarious !! I laughed constantly all the way through. But it's a different type of humor. More mature maybe. So forget Chris Knight !! Mike Judge is the REAL GENIUS !!The cast and the characters are brilliant to say the least. There are a lot of unforgettable performances given here, most noticeably by actors Gary Cole, John C. McGinley, and Stephen Root, because their characters are so stylizied, but in great ways that really work beautifully. Also look out for Mike THE MAN Judge in a cameo as Jennifer Aniston's annoying boss. (He's credited as William King though).Anyone who has ever worked a day in their life can relate to this movie. Having to do something every single day that just bores you to death. Gettin' a lot of unnecessary crap from your boss. The brown nosers. Workers who get run over by everybody because they don't stand up for themselves. And the ones who are finally fed up. A big part of this movie is about not losing your personality and your own self respect. And that so many people let themselves get crapped on out of fear of losing their jobs, that they're really not satisfied with in the first place, just because it's their meal ticket. So I wanna go tell my boss to go you know what himself right now !! The film doesn't advocate doing that. It's just a personal note !!Office Space is the reason why I love movies. As I wrote in my IMDb review of Die Hard I had that feeling you have after you've experienced something great and unique, and you're aware of it. It's a feeling that I get inside, like something wonderful has happened in there. A feeling that stays with me long after I've left the theater. It doesn't happen often (I watch almost everything that comes out), but it happened tonight after watching Office Space. This is a movie that's gonna have a place in my heart for the rest of my life. And I'm gonna watch it over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over again !!Go and see this film !! If I could give a refund to anyone not liking it I would, because I can't imagine anyone not loving it. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't be surprised if someone wanted to give me a reward instead, just for the hot tip. I give this movie 20 out of 10 !! EXCELLENT !!MR.

Based on the best selling book by Nelson DeMille, General's Daughter is a very middling and mangy thriller.  The kind of film that forces you to imagine that this material should have stayed a book. John Travolta plays Brenner with a nice balance of humor and intensity. After A Civil Action, this film shows just how solid an actor Travolta has become. Spitting out the not-so-hot dialog with fire and cynicism, his performance here single-handedly saves the film from utter failure.  It's also a treat to see Madeleine Stowe back on the screen, yet the film doesn't quite know what to do with her. Leslie Stefanson plays the daughter in question.  Her performance is completely without any life whatsoever. Maybe she could be more effective on Boy Meets World. The story of Daughter has a very sinister opening.  An opening filled with great promise to the depravity that lies ahead.  What the movie fails to do is keep that gruesome pace going.  The climax of the movie is a complete fiasco.  It negates the first half of the film just by being so openly blind to the tightly wound story that I was promised in the first five minutes of screen time. Simon West is not known for subtlety. The director of Con Air keeps his overdirecting streak alive with poorly chosen shots and an overindulgence with the AVID editing machine.I wished the film had kept its game face on for the entire 115 minutes.

It didn't seem to go out of it's way to offend anyone. And the jokes may have not come as fast and furious, but the humor kept a consistent tone throughout.By contrast, APTSWSM was uneven. It ranges from witty to uproarious to flat to extremely raunchy. Speaking of raunchy, there's enough bawdy and scatalogical humor here to make There's Something jealous and Dumb & Dumber jealous.Also, the pop culture references are heaped on a little too liberally. Admittedly, I found most (or at least some) of them funny, hilarious even, but I miss the subtlety of the first film. There wasn't an obvious attempt to endear itself to the pop-culture reference fans.TSWSM relies on mimicking its predecessor in several moments for plot support or filler; perhaps too many. The quotation mark gesture made by Dr. Evil (and his Mini-Me), in particular, started to get real old, real fast. The first film, did it a few times and that was it; it didn't bash the poor thing into the ground.Hurley is sultrier, sexier and just plain better looking (imo) than Heather Graham. Hurley is a goddess, where Graham is a mere nymph. Furthermore, Hurley (whose performance in the sequel was as delightful as in the original; all 6 minutes of it) knew she was in a goofy parody, and her acting was purposefully cheesy to suit the film; it made her all the more charming. By comparison, and I could be wrong here but, in retrospect, I think maybe sometimes Graham was acting as if she was taking it all more seriously than she should have - especially in those silly maudlin scenes with her and Austin expressing their love for each other (*retch*). Frankly, I found parts of her Boogie Nights performance more ironic. And her timing was off.Like I said, I thought much of TSPWSM funny, but other aspects I found tiresome and I don't think I'll be interested in a second Austin sequel; the franchise has just about already burnt itself out for me.

It probably helped that I was in a theater of about 200 other people, who were all having a good time.  A responsive audience sure adds to the experience. For those of you who want to overanalyze -- it's a silly movie that knows it's silly, and doesn't need to apologize. Just the put brain in low gear, and enjoy the ride.Scenes that stand out -- any scene with Mini-Me.  VERY politically incorrect, but honestly...incredibly funny. The music-video parody was OUTRAGEOUSLY hilarious. The tent scene was a riot.  Dr. Evil intoxicated with Austin's Mojo, leading to a wickedly funny love sequence -- yikes!  Austin drinking coffee.  The list goes on and on...I didn't even know until reading comments up here that Mike Meyers was Fat Bastard, I thought they really had a fat guy doing the acting!   I'm pretty impressed.Is this the best comedy of all time?  In terms of sheer pratfalls, silliness, sight-gags, and laughs-per-minute, the award still goes to Leslie Nielsen in Wrongfully Accused (an Airplane style comedy based on The Fugitive) and Leslie Nielsen in any of the Naked Gun movies.But check out The Spy who shagged me (on video if you have to.)
