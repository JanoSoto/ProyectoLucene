[{"date":"31 January 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Fight Club is a bold film and an attack on the consumer-driven life-style adopted by many people in this world. It is an original piece of film work that never ceases to surprise and never bores. Fight Club is a very well made film. Most viewers might think this film is simply about men beating each other up from the title and what they may have heard from other viewers but it is much deeper than that. This film has underlying themes that make you think about the life you are living and our consumer-driven world and is in fact relevant to our present times. Edward Norton is the Narrator and protagonist of the film. Brad Pitt plays Tyler Durden and is a figment of the narrator's imagination and is the antagonist. Both of these roles are well depicted and portrayed by the actors. These two are very talented and fit their roles well. Fight Club is rated R by the MPAA for disturbing and graphic depiction of violent anti-social behavior, sexuality and language. This movie has several scenes containing brutal fights that have their fair share of violence and gore and it also shows uses of alcohol and smoking by the actors. There is also brief nudity throughout the film. Combining all of that with the F-word being used 76 times in the film it is no surprise that it is rated R. But that does not take away from how well this film has been made. Most audiences will have a hard time identifying the visual effects of Fight Club from the film's live action. Many of the visual effects sequences literally fly past the viewers, in one smooth and continuous motion. These spectacularly realistic sequences keep the story moving forward. David Fincher and the film's Visual Effects Supervisor, Kevin Haug, chose to work with BUF Inc. for most of the CGI-based effects sequences in the film. These groups of artists worked well together to achieve very artistic options for the films visual effects. They furthered the filmmaker's vision while advancing their own visual effects expertise. Fight Club is a film worth seeing, but is not for the faint of heart due to its violence and profanity used in the film. It is a artistic masterpiece and a memorable and superior motion picture. It is a rare movie that does not abandon its quest to jolt the viewer.

Up until recently the only superhero movie that I really liked was Batman Returns, however this was before the recent offerings from Christopher Nolan appeared, and even then it wasn't until one of my friends sat me down and actually showed me Batman Begins that I actually realised that some of the more recent offerings were actually pretty good. So, it was when Spiderman 3 hit the movies, that I decided to watch the earlier two, and discovering that all three were directed by Sam Rami (better known for the Evil Dead trilogy) that I actually gave this genre another glance.Spiderman has been around since the 60's, though is first appearance was in a compilation comic book. However he quickly became very popular, and has since spawned numerous comic book series, cartoons, and as of recently, three movies. He is also rated as the third most popular superhero (with Wolverine taking out first place). To me Spiderman differs from a lot of the other superheros in that he is simply not a very strong alien (eg Superman) or some rich billionaire (eg Batman and Ironman) but rather a struggling photographer that happened to have been bitten by a spider that had been genetically altered.I am not that familiar with the development of the superhero franchises so I cannot say whether Spiderman took superheros in a new direction, and I can't say that the film does so either. However this film does raise the idea of the superhero as a struggling young boy who lives a double life. While no movie truly follows the comic books (it would be very difficult to do so), we do have the aspects of where Peter Parker starts off as a highschool kid, goes to college, and then tries to make his way in the real world, while living a double life a Spiderman.One of the strange things is that when Peter Parker discovers that he is a superhero, he does not immediately run off and tell everybody. In fact he tries his best to keep it secret. Even in the fight scene where the school bully decides to try and teach him a lesson, he does his best to play it low, buy dodging all of his punches, performing flips in the air, and it is only when he is forced to that he punches back, and it is with this single punch that he pretty much brings the fight to an end.This film, and indeed the other three, seem to focus on the loneliness of being a superhero. He has to keep his identity secret, and while he has friends (and these friendships are tested with his double life) he does not believe that he can really get close to anybody, which is why he quietly rejects MJ at the end.In the comics Spiderman is not alone, he has the entire Marvel universe to interact with, and does have affairs with a number of X-men (including Kitty Pride, aka Shadowcat, and Jean Grey has a crush on him). However he always seems to remain the lone masked figure. Very similar to Wolverine in many respects. In one comic that I read, Wolverine finishes off a whole building of ninja's, and Spiderman makes a cameo, asking if he needs any help, which Wolverine (not surprisingly) politely declines. I do believe that these films capture this loneliness quite well, but it is something that I will explore further once I watch the next two films.

Events occur that knock us off our projected course and reshape us as an individual without any sense of direction of how to get back; and this is a story of one of those journeys. Rannulph Junah (Matt Damon) is an up and coming phenom golfer from Georgia who is sent off to fight in World War 1. When he returns home, his confidence is completely shattered and proceeds to spiral into the depths of alcoholism. Upon inheriting a golf course, Junah's old flame, Adele Inergordon (Charlize Theron)decides to solve the golf courses financial woes with a one-on-one golf tournament with the two best golfers in the world, Bobby Jones (Joel Gretch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill). The town pleads for an addition from Savannah to represent them in the tournament and Rannulph Junah is selected. Severely reluctant, being an understatement, Junah decides to play and quickly realizes (along with everyone else) that he is a shell of his former self. One night while Junah is horrifically hitting golf balls, literally, out of nowhere appears Bagger Vance (Will Smith), and becomes Junah's caddy for the match. Using a combination of life experience and an unexplainable knowledge Bagger Vance helps Junah find what he has lost, his swing. Director Robert Redford uses golf as a medium to explain this, painful and emotional, story of a man who once had everything and lost it all fighting for his country in World War 1. He shows us that remembering involves reconnecting; in this case Junah is assisted by Bagger Vance in remembering his swing and conquering his fears, and most importantly that whatever may be buried deep in the past was only just a moment ago. Redford uses rather deep cinematography to focus in on the symbolism of everything around us, and how listening and feeling reconnects us to what we knew. This movie is a little on the cerebral and emotional side, and involves some soul searching to connect with the true point of the film. The performances by Damon, Theron and Smith are terrific.(The film is rated PG-13 for language and some sensuality) ","genre":null},{"date":"31 January 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Every one of us has faced an adversity (or two) in our lives where we decide flight is the choice instead of fight.

We are confronted with an economic system that suppresses downwards; nobody is held responsible. It even seems that nobody doesn't even exist.This is a story about how ordinary citizens, mainly farmers, gets affected by the big depression. We follow the Joad family who out of desperation tries to find a job in California. When they arrive at the promised land they quickly find out that life is hard to maintain. The jobs are difficult to find and when they find one the wages are an insult. Throughout the movie there is a constant battle to sustain the basic needs such as food and shelter. Despite this fight and the competition for the jobs the workers shows solidarity with each other but cannot use this to get proper organized even though a few tries (the story could be seen as a predecessor to In Dubious battle where the struggle to get the workers organized continuous).The Joad family are very poor given the circumstances but nonetheless they are looked down upon and stigmatized; being poor equals being subhuman; An Okie. If they ask questions or making a statement in front of a policeman or guard they are threatened to loose their job or getting the label agitator.Only in one place do they find themselves at home; in the government camp. It is a society in its own that is a safe heaven. It is built on democratic principles and is looked upon as a threat by the big corporations who actively tries to destroy such. Democracy with it laws that regulates employer\/employee relationship is a threat to maximum profit.The movie is shot in Black and white, the men are lean and the dialogue is very direct and without polite manners. You sense that the farmers doesn't talk this way because of hostility but simply because it is part of their cultural identity. The dialogue is in many cases taken right out of the book. That doesn't make it a lesser movie; it is hard if not to say impossible to compete with Steinbecks sharp pen. It may be a challenge to sense the affection in the Joad family but is there although it is not expressed overtly.In comparison the movie adaptation has a stronger focus than the more than 500 pages book had and therefore some of the characters didn't unfold enough to be understood properly. The ending is different but I think I understand the choice to let the movie finish off in a more bearable way.The part of the story where the Joads arrive at a farm full of guards, to harvest peaches scared the hell out of me in the book but not so much in the movie. It felt like the Joads where held in a combined prison\/zoo and the choice they had to leave wasn't a real choice; it was a choice between annihilation or accept gruesome and absurd life conditions.The movie didn't dwell so much. It didn't stay so much with the important details that showed the reason to be desperate. How much can I get for a nickel? How much do I earn when I harvest a basket full of peaches? How much food can I buy for a day's work? Can I save money for the rainy days? Seems like boring details but to me these kind of never ceasing thoughts must have been a large part of being affected by the depression.Steinbeck writes the story with anger. You sense that he is furious; this is a piece of fiction that was needed, that had to come and thank goodness Steinbeck took it upon himself to put into words what was going on during the depression.The farmers are the 99% who tries to do what is expected of them. There is a growing sense of who the 1% are &#x96; and of course you can draw a parallel to the depression of today and the need to organize and criticize the financial system via the occupy wall street movement.Regards Simon ","genre":null},{"date":"31 January 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I got my orders, it ain't up to me, I didn't set the price, take it or leave it.

It is a society in its own that is a safe heaven. It is built on democratic principles and is looked upon as a threat by the big corporations who actively tries to destroy such. Democracy with it laws that regulates employer\/employee relationship is a threat to maximum profit.The movie is shot in Black and white, the men are lean and the dialogue is very direct and without polite manners. You sense that the farmers doesn't talk this way because of hostility but simply because it is part of their cultural identity. The dialogue is in many cases taken right out of the book. That doesn't make it a lesser movie; it is hard if not to say impossible to compete with Steinbecks sharp pen. It may be a challenge to sense the affection in the Joad family but is there although it is not expressed overtly.In comparison the movie adaptation has a stronger focus than the more than 500 pages book had and therefore some of the characters didn't unfold enough to be understood properly. The ending is different but I think I understand the choice to let the movie finish off in a more bearable way.The part of the story where the Joads arrive at a farm full of guards, to harvest peaches scared the hell out of me in the book but not so much in the movie. It felt like the Joads where held in a combined prison\/zoo and the choice they had to leave wasn't a real choice; it was a choice between annihilation or accept gruesome and absurd life conditions.The movie didn't dwell so much. It didn't stay so much with the important details that showed the reason to be desperate. How much can I get for a nickel? How much do I earn when I harvest a basket full of peaches? How much food can I buy for a day's work? Can I save money for the rainy days? Seems like boring details but to me these kind of never ceasing thoughts must have been a large part of being affected by the depression.Steinbeck writes the story with anger. You sense that he is furious; this is a piece of fiction that was needed, that had to come and thank goodness Steinbeck took it upon himself to put into words what was going on during the depression.The farmers are the 99% who tries to do what is expected of them. There is a growing sense of who the 1% are &#x96; and of course you can draw a parallel to the depression of today and the need to organize and criticize the financial system via the occupy wall street movement.Regards Simon ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"31 January 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I got my orders, it ain't up to me, I didn't set the price, take it or leave it. We are confronted with an economic system that suppresses downwards; nobody is held responsible. It even seems that nobody doesn't even exist.This is a story about how ordinary citizens, mainly farmers, gets affected by the big depression. We follow the Joad family who out of desperation tries to find a job in California. When they arrive at the promised land they quickly find out that life is hard to maintain. The jobs are difficult to find and when they find one the wages are an insult. Throughout the movie there is a constant battle to sustain the basic needs such as food and shelter.
