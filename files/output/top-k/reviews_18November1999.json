It left me with a truly miserable feeling afterwards (wouldn't that make a great quote to print on the video box?).  Sure, it's all very tragic.

I must admit, however, that having no particular regard for religion in any form, I cannot understand Sister Prejean and her motivations.  A scene that stands out in my mind is one in which Sister Prejean visits the father of one of the murder victims, Clyde Percy (perfectly case with R. Lee Ermey).  Even though he does profess an old-fashioned respect for religion, he firmly tells her to get lost after learning the reason for her visit.  This character's motivations I understand.

(On that subject, read the amazing IMDb comments for an animated Japanese film called Grave of the Fireflies, a movie that does indeed induce tears.  It's about innocence destroyed by war  --  in my view a subject worthy of tears  --  and it's a beautiful film that I would love to watch again.)  Also, standing Poncelet up in the death chamber with his arms extended out to his sides, evoking the image of a crucifixion, is some really heavy-handed symbolism.  This man didn't die for our sins, he died for his.  Yes, it's very sad, and it makes you feel lousy, but I think it's probably for the best.  It's my fervent hope that if I myself ever sank to such a degraded level, someone would put me out of my misery as well, despite protests from myself and all others.

The film is now over fifty years old but its story and message is just as new as when this film came out. Two of the three G.I.'s future seems somewhat secure. Frederic March as Al Stephenson an Army Sergeant returns to his family although a little changed due to the natural process of maturing regarding his children. He returns to his job in a bank and even though he is hitting the booze a little the viewer gets the feeling that he will settle down in time and because of his war experience will be a better man for it.       Harold Russell himself a wounded veteran portrays Homer Parrish a Navy veteran who lost both hands during a sea battle.  He will be provided for financially by a disability pension and even though his life will never be what it was before losing both hands the viewer also gets the feeling that he will make out in time.  Then there is the Dana Andrews character Army Air Force Captain Fred Derry the only officer of the three.  He was nothing more than an attendant at the local drug store soda fountain before his country called.  He now returns to his hometown an Officer and a Gentleman and decorated war hero.  Sadly that's about all he has going for him.  This was the one character as I watched this film and thought `Now this guy would have been better off to have stayed in the service'  Of course he probably for the purpose of the story had been forced out due to man power cutting.

He gives every indication that he will be come one of  many WWII veterans who returned to their hometowns and found life boring and mundane compared to the 100% life living experience of being in the military during time of war. Eventually many would wind up hanging out at the local American Legion or VFW posts knocking back the booze and reliving perhaps for many literally the best years of their lives.  The triple story line is handled very well with their paths crossing during the course of the film.  Romance, marital woes even a brief questioning of America's involvement in WWII  are also included in the picture.

The experiment  to turn a begger  Billy Ray Valentine, Eddie Murphy (48 Hours,The Nutty Professor),  into a successful  and  wealthy person. They turn a rich person, Louis Winthorpe III Dan Aykroyd  (Driving Miss Daisy,My Fellow Americans), into a homeless, jobless, pennyless, friendless, foodless, hopeless, girlfriend -less, credit card- less, fashionable-less, club-less, perfume-less, and many other lesses you can come up with person. He became the type of person who has to hang out with low lives and a prostitute,Ophelia played by Jamie Lee Curtis  (A Fish Called Wanda, Nicholas' Gift).  The premise of the movie is a Harvard educated man will commit a crime without his friends and his safe environment.  Louis Winthorpe III, became full of anger, rage, and could not comprehend what had he done wrong. In the mean time Billy Ray is suspicious, and even broke a beautiful vase that cost thirty-five thousand dollars,  just to see if it really belonged to him.  After that he began treasuring his possessions, and showed much intelligence. Well,  he was a smart beggar, who also pretended to be crippled who got healed and started praising the Lord, soon after cops made him walk!  What a funny scene!  The entire movie is a complete riot!  It is full of laughter, has a lot of funny lines, and is a totally satisfying experience. I love the movie. As those SNL guys always stick together in real life, they did in the movie also,  Billy Ray and Louis Winthorpe, what a pompous name, ganged up to destroy the two old snobs and they did so very successfully!  The music in this movie gives an atmosphere of wealth. The butler Coleman Denholm Elliott (September, A Room with a View) adds a regal touch to the movie. My favorite scenes  Billy Ray Valentine getting healed.  The Jacuzzi scene. I think that this one of my favorite characters that Eddie Murphy played outside of his Saturday Night Live characters. He is talented. It seems that all that Billy Ray Valentine does makes me laugh, starting out with his name.  Sounds like the name of a liquor!  My Favorite Quotes Coleman It's a whirlpool bath, Sir. I think you'll enjoy it. Billy Ray Hey! This is all right! When I was a kid, we wanted bubbles, we had....!  You will have to finish reading this sentence,  under quotes. Just click QUOTES on your left. It is there! I promise! I watched this movie when it came out the Jacuzzi scene and the quote I never forgot. The movie was nominated for Oscars, Golden Globe,  British Academy Awards, and also won several awards, which were all well deserved. I definitely recommend it!

It's not in my top ten favorite films, but easily in my top thirty. It didn't start out that way, it's one of those movies that takes multiple viewings to really absorb it all, and thanks to HBO, I did. I don't know what drew me to it, maybe the Huey Lewis & The News look of its characters. Maybe it's the off-kilter, kooky soundtrack. Or maybe it's the great performances by it's ast of villains, which includes John Lithgow, Christopher Lloyd and Vincent Schiavelli. It could be the little things sprinkled throughout the story.What little things am I talking about? Well ... ...Peter Weller plays Banzai, the multi-talented hero, who is the center of the movie. It's Weller's that makes it seem like all the events going on seem like it's just an ordinary  day for him. Bad aliens from another dimension. Good aliens who threaten nuclear war. Torture slugs. Flying seashells. Yeah, that's real ordinary. ...John Lithgow is the film's chief badguy, who has the all best lines, all delivered with an outrageous Italian accent. ...Banzai is truly a national hero. He has divisions of Blue Blazer Irregulars all throughout the country, almost like a militia, but only taking what's good about militias(!). ...It's got a great Halloween connection. You've heard about Orson Welle's War of the Worlds dramacast on Oct.31, 1938, right? Y'know, the one that panicked America. Well, Across the Eighth Dimension tells you what Welles was really reporting. ...If your first name is John, you may be a Lectroid, the aliens in the film. It seems when the Lectroids first arrived on Earth, they thought John was some sort of title, so all the bad guys names begin with John....John Whorfin... John Yaya... John Small Berries... John O'Connor...John Parker... John Bigboote. ...Banzai's bandmates are all pretty cool, too. My favorite, Perfect Tommy, played by Lewis Smith. But they aren't all no-namers. Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum and Clancy Brown are all in the cast too. ...At the end of the film, a sequel is promised Buckaroo Banzai Against the World Crime League. It never appeared.

I think the reason people rejected this film is because of one of its strengths, specifically the way it explores the nature of evil inside of everyone.  Will Patton's General Bethlehem is one of film's most memorable villains.  At one point, he admits to Costner that before society collapsed, he sold copy machines. He's a regular guy, just like you or me, who turned evil when society fell apart.  That's more scary than any psycho killer in any horror film.
