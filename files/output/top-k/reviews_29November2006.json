Maybe because i'm a huge luhrmann fan, i love hes red curtain movies and the distinctive and lavish cinematography of them.The only negative aspect to me in this adaption of the worlds most famous love story was the casting of claire danes and leo DiCaprio. They were good but not brilliant. Shakespeare is about the language and there's no point in portraying a Shakespeare play if you do not deliver the dialoge properly. Claire tended to rush the lines and not let her mouth open up to get it around the words. It sometimes felt like she fully didn't understand the text of what she was saying. I can really see that should would have needed strong direction as some of her gestures, they way she moved and spoke seemed forced. Physically she looked every inch like a juliet with her curious eyes and young features.Leo i think did a better job than danes in the fact that he had a lot of passion but with his characterization, his actions spoke louder than words. The scene where we are introduced to romeo with his voice over made me cringe and because this was the first time in the film we were hearing him speak Shakespeare, it left me in a lot of doubt having to hear him in the rest of the film, not a good start. However the scene where he watches juliet dance with Paris made up for it. In some scenes he over acted in other's not enough. I personally think the love scenes should have been A lot more intense, it was to tender. Romeo and juliet is not suppose to be all prettied-up but brutal and powerful both in violence and romance.I can now sit back and look past those glitches and take in the film because i don't think baz would have been able to find 2 other actors to portray those roles any better than leo and claire. If anything other young actors would have probably given the same performance.Leo and claire do NOT make me dislike the film in the slightest though. I was driven to near tears during the beautiful fish tank scene it was like a fantasy, the whole Capulet ball sequence was like a fantasy. The way they suddenly jumped up and began searching each other with there eyes made you really believe that it was love at first site. That has got to be one of the most stunning pieces on film. Of course the death scene. I liked they they twisted it a bit so that instead of juliet waking to find romeo dead she watches him and looks into his eyes alive for the last time before reuniting in death. For those teenagers that were saying 'why didn't she say something to stop him from killing himself' it's this simple..............you can't re-write history. We all know how it ends but it still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat while watching it unfold.I could go on and on about the film in a lot of ways but at the end of the day, it's entertaining and beautiful and tragic, and thats what romeo and juliet, the story is about. Baz has not let anyone down, he has not killed the play, he ha re-invented it for today's generation.

What has become the major criticism has been a focus not on what the film was, but what it could have been. This is truly unfair to the finished product as SUPERMAN III did have a lot to offer and remains quite entertaining today. Please read on as I qualify a statement that may be viewed a blasphemous among many fans.First let's get something straight. The film was not a bomb. It made less than the first 2, however part II made less than part I, and yet is considered a strong film whatever cut of it you see. Part III made less, but was still very successful. Second, part III is attacked for 2 reasons. The first is of course the lack of DONNER and his influences (director Richard Donner of the first film and part of the second). Yes, it is indeed sad that we will never know how far he could taken the series had he not been so unceremoniously canned; however that is something we cannot change or know and Part III is it's own animal and should be judged thusly. True, it does suffer some major drawbacks. There is real lack of spark without Lois around and the humor is very overpowering in many spots (the opening for example is entertaining, but completely off tone for the franchise). It does however benefit from a wonderful Lana Lang (the still very beautiful and active Superman actress in the current Smallville series, Annette O'Toole), a fun and unpredictable battle with a supercomputer, the ever reliable Reeve as Superman once again, and a scene which should be considered one of the greatest scenes in ANY superhero film, good Supes vs. Bad. That scene alone warrants a viewing.The second complaint is with co-star Richard Pryor. Anyone who has seen BATMAN and Nicholson's dominance of screen time, or even the first SUPERMAN must acknowledge that SUPERMAN III is not the only film to focus at least as much on the villain (if not more so) as they do the hero. It is sometimes distracting the extent they focus on Pryor in the film, but he also brings both a lightly villainous but also strong sense of humanity to a part that could have simply have been just a forgettable henchman. There was a distinct overuse of his character, but he by no means sinks the film. It should also be pointed out that the first 2 films (I rank, as do many others as some of the best Superhero films ever made) also had their flaws both in continuity (if Krypton had been destroyed thousands of years earlier, how then does the education in the crystals on the way to Earth reference 20th Century information for example) and logic (so it's just mere coincidence that tossing a nuclear bomb\/missile into the vastness of space would just happen to explode a phantom zone prison floating around from Kyrpton?) and even Donner's work was occasionally improved by the choices made by Lester (his contributions to the franchise are a real injustice on their own as he is also an immensely talented filmmaker). Of course the third is no where near the shear wonder of parts 1 and 2, but it does stand well on it's own as a side adventure outside the first two films' mythology and despite it's shortcomings features some truly memorable effects, action and of course legendary Christopher Reeve playing not just dual, but a trio of roles.

It is pure D&D, at least as far as I know it from 25 yrs of game mastering, a truly deep delve in the world of gaming. That so many people despise, nay, hate it with all their heart's content (look at the board) shows, how close it hit home in that regard.Some high points and how they relate to gaming.1) Irons chewing up the scenes. He has a better voice than I do, but apart from that I do the same thing at my game table when representing the villain. Alternatively I do the menacing silent guy.2) Payne slow moving 'n stuff. You must be joking. He actually quotes me. In my games, when the group doesn't realize their foe is way over their head, I let him move slowly and utter lines like that. (Not that it would help much, stupid players) 3) Death of Snails; well, when a character (not the player!) has done enough to seriously p*ss me or the rest of the group off, he is bound to meet his end (always with fair means and a chance to escape). And who p*ssed the audience more off than Snails? I remember the cheers in the theatre. (And yet it was touching in a weird way). Snails also is a persona frequently found at gaming tables - the wisecracking dumb*beep* who is spoiling the fun with his witty and funny remarks. Death to him I say. (Representing a player and a PC? Uh-uh, multilayered reality ;) ) 4) Plot. Cheesy world saving quest with dungeon hopping and a quick dash into the elven woods for some R&R and a lot of Behind-the-scenes wisdom. What gamemaster of our (the first) generation never has used that plot line or at least considered using it? (The plot revealed in the deleted scenes on DVD actually works very well within the limited scope of a game world.) 5) General acting skills. Despite the fact that solid to good actors are doing strange things here - can you remember how your high school buddies roleplayed (i.e. acted) their characters at the gaming table? How did that look like? Ring a bell? I could go on for a quite a while.6) The dwarf too tall, mage not using spell components properly - hey, currently my tallest player is having a halfling character, and complicated spell-casting rules tend to get muddy in the thick of things. That's the way of these worlds, isn't it. You need a dwarf (and an elf) in the group to save the world, don't you know? Well, latest player to join gets one of them, regardless of height....Solomon did not bring us a movie in the D&D universe. He also did us not explain the actual game mechanics. He created a movie immersing us in the D&D experience. That's something different, and he like so totally delivered. D&D (IMHO) is cheesy, campy, over the top and (from a narrative point of view) quite often very bad, all this adding up to several trainloads of fun. Naturally this does not refer to people having adopted D&D 3.X, which tends to take itself too serious and causes the most boring gaming tables (apart from Shadowrun) at cons.All in all I nearly laughed my head off. Irons was completely unchecked by anyone on the set and so much fun! I think he tried to get back at his director, but in the end, he makes this movie an outstanding piece of camp.

Before I describe the overpowering smell of cheese i must point out a few things... First I watched it for the first time in 2006, but maybe that only let the cheese mature. Secondly I watched it in Russia which subsequently meant that it was dubbed. But before i am attacked by fans for bothering to write an opinion about it even though i saw a dubbed version of it, which obviously spoils any movie good or bad, i have to say this time i was glad that a film was dubbed. I understood the translation and was glad to be spared hearing the ridiculous script from the actors, which could of made it unbearable but the dubbing at least made it comical.It is a typical love story that could be used in any film situation, but this time it exploited the titanic's tragedy. I am not knocking any romance films or anything and appreciate that it is an extremely popular genre. But is came across as so basic and predictable i wished it was in the hands of David Lynch or Ken Russell, to liven things up a little.The sinking of the ship was the best bit, and kind of exciting too, but with that amount of money you could probably make a film about pulling the bath plug out your bath and make it look epic. However even the actual sinking, dieing and drowning had the sugar coated Hollywood feel. Which came across in casting and acting too, but i won't even go there. Back to the cheese factor, the ICING on the cake (sorry) was the sound track. Celine Dion whatever you do and however you do it, you just stink.To rate this movie I will give it three out of ten.

Secondly because Kate Winslet is so fine, with or without her clothes on. If fact her outfits though out the film are excellent. Third point goes to the absurd amount of money spent on the sinking bit which subsequently made me think for the first time about how truly horrific it must of actually been in real life, which was considerably worse than what we see in this easy to watch catastrophe.

There wasn't one moment I DIDN'T laugh. I absolutely LOOOOOVE Shannon. She is nerd comedy precisely where the late Gilda Radner left off (before her demise). What more can I say about her? This film is not ONLY her SNL alter-ego 'Mary Catherine Gallagher', but her real-life personality as a former Irish-Catholic schoolgirl. This film basically depicts her former real-life experience growing up in Catholic school education, but from a modern-day perspective, and with hilarious side-kicks. Will Ferrell is perfectly cast as the football hero hunk who is 'broken up with Evian. We're dancing in the contest. But we're still 'broken up'. Genius! And talk about the choice of Harlan Williams as the mystery biker hunk??? Oh babeee. He made my heart melt to goo. What woman wouldn't want this sexy mute (stuttering) pulling up to rescue her off to a pool for a swim? (somebody STOP me!!!) Especially in the special ed classroom scene when Helen (the women's basketball giant) is briefing Mary on the other kids, and biker hunk walks in. He scribbles his name on the attendance card 'H E R E', then catches Mary looking at him, and shoots her a glance, almost wiggling his eyebrows (!!!) I about died laughing - the response on Mary's face.Elaine Hendrix is delicious as the stuck-up, booby cheerleader Evian - 'I think I just might wanna kick yer a**!'. Amazing how many grown up actors can pass for teenagers in this movie!! But Hendrix is double-funny as Evian ('you should be embarrassed....you're parents named you after BOTTLED WATER---'), especially in the scene where she calls her cheerleader stuck ups, 'it so wasn't your fault, Evian' 'Thank you -- I KNOW'. If any former nerd girl can't relate to that vignette, than she is not from THIS planet.My family has told me repeatedly that this movie reminds them so much of me, as a girl. That I WAS Mary Catherine, growing up in my teens. The unattractive nerd girl, whom everyone made fun of in high school (even if I didn't attend Catholic school), and became friends with the 'outcasts', like Mary did. That I was very much a 'dreamer', much like Mary Catherine. And that I only desired a normal 'kiss' like in the movies, just like Mary Catherine does. The only exception there was never any hunky biker mute that I ran off to a public pool with, nor wanted to bag the football hunk, nor did I go around school grounds kissing trees (and being caught by the nuns). But the rest of the plot is amazingly similar, far as desiring to run off to Hollywood, like Mary Catherine does.This film is an absolute must-see. And from a religious standpoint, really does not offend anyone, religious or not, far as the God-scenes go. Shannon's team did a wonderful job in creating the God presence, in more of a modern, relaxed - but not overbearing way (Will Ferrell), which should please any movie fan.This film is not screwball, dopey, or bathroom, stupid humor, nor low-class.

While I usually feel that directors are responsible for the greatness of films, not actors, this is certainly a case to test that rule.

I remember watching Transformers as a kid and I remember playing with the toys with my friends at their house. But further more I really have no recollections of the series. Guess I was too young at the time when the Transformers were at their prime in the Netherlands. I remembered the basic main characters but that was about it.For anyone who isn't really that familiar with the '80's cartoon series, this can be a very confusing and even bad movie to watch. Really nothing is ever explained in this movie and everything is just taken for granted. Basically the entire movie is about the Autobots constantly fighting the Decepticons but in the movie it never gets clear way. The entire story lacks a purpose and the movie is just basically the one event after the other without bothering to explain anything, or even introduce the characters. I'm sure that the movie worked better in 1986, when new Transformers animated series episodes were still being made and everybody was still really into the series and characters. The movie was perhaps perfect for its time but in todays perspective the movie is just silly and without a point.The '80's musical score makes the movie feel even more outdated!The story is really the weakest thing about the movie. Sure, when compared to a animated series episode the story is more complex and bigger but nevertheless, for 'just' a movie the story is just way too weak and simple. The movie also heavily 'borrows' from the Star Wars movies with its story.For the fans this movie is a nostalgic trip to a great period of growing up with the animated series and the classic characters. They should be able to appreciate all of the characters and big battles in the movie but for a non-fan the movie simply just has very little entertainment to offer. The humor is underused and the most fun and interesting characters seems wasted in the story. Often characters are introduced quickly in the movie and they disappear out of just as quick (often without a clear reason or explanation) again.Still the characters are the reason why the movie still somewhat works out. All of the characters are highly imaginative and obviously have a long background with each other. But like I said before, all of the best and most interesting characters are wasted in the movie and the movie also has way too many characters in it for a 84 minutes short movie.For most part the animations look just the same as for the television show, with the exceptions of a couple of big battle sequences, that are detailed but at the same time also quite confusing to watch at times.Oh, and Orson Welles somehow also got mixed up in this. I'm really not surprised that he later regretted this and actually hated the movie.If you're a fan and grew up with the series, then by all means see this movie, already for nostalgic reasons alone but if you're just like me, a person who've seen some of the animated series episodes but it didn't made an huge or lasting impression on you, than you're really better of just skip viewing it. 5\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"29 November 2006","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" To be honest this movie was a real deception, after hearing all the positive stories about it.Guess I'm just not a fan.

It is a romantic spectacle set against the backdrop of historical events and became both a huge Oscar-winning success and the surprise box office behemoth of its era. Another similarity it shares with the former is that following the success it is now considered hip to be derogatory and dismiss it as a Hollywood film. It is a Hollywood film, but not in the insulting manner that detractors would indicate. It is a sublime demonstration of what can happen when a visionary director puts his reputation on the line and uses the limits of what Hollywood has to offer to bring it to the screen.The film opens in present day with a group of scientific treasure hunters exploring the remains of the sunken Titanic in an effort to locate a priceless necklace. Instead, they find a preserved portrait of a young woman. The elderly woman, Rose (Gloria Stuart), is located and brought to the site to relate her story of the last days of the Titanic and the film unfolds. It is a familiar romantic tale with rich-in-name-only Rose (now played by Kate Winslet) betrothed against her will to a boorish millionaire. In a fit of pique, she contemplates suicide and is talked out of it by charming penniless artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). During the remainder of the ill-fated voyage, they fall in love and incur the wrath of her fiancé and her mother, until the fateful iceberg and destiny in the icy waters of the North Atlantic intervene.There are so many ways that the film could have gone wrong, but director James Cameron wisely sidesteps them. Much of the fuel used by the detractors of the film would have turned it into an infinitely weaker production. Evidence of Cameron's sure narrative hand can be found in numerous spots. Starting the film with the treasure hunters provides for a brilliant moment which allows them to recreate on a computer the death throes of the Titanic so that when the final 90 minutes begin the viewer is completely aware of why certain things are occurring as they do. It also offers a wonderful opportunity for 1930s film star Gloria Stuart to show her acting chops as the latter day Rose.Cameron also gives us a strong scope of the immensity of the great ship herself, as well as the class differentiation in the status of the clientele traveling therein. Much has been made of centering the film on the two characters of Jack and Rose, while having the remainder of the cast play support rather than spread the wealth around more. One could and has done that it is called The Poseidon Adventure. The reason why this film works on so many levels is because it is far more than the standard disaster epic. The fact that the action is basically consolidated through the eyes of young lovers streamlines the film and keeps the action focused, and Cameron comes up with increasingly inventive ways to move them through different parts of the ship to cover as much action as possible. The fact that they are young lovers experiencing their first romance provides a vitality and sense of urgency that may have been missing from older protagonists. Many have sneered over much the Jack Rose Jack dialog interaction in the climactic moments as a lack of good writing, but given that we are talking about teenage lovers in serious peril, one wonders if people expected them to quote intellectual diatribes back and forth. Instead, what comes from their mouths is far more likely and believable, if repetitive. Further, look at how often Cameron takes the narrative high road. When Jack is invited by the rich people to join them for dinner for saving Rose early in the film, he could have punctured the egos of the rich and wowed Rose with his coarseness. Instead, he behaves in a totally mature fashion and ends up charming the majority of those at their table. The film is brimming with memorable sequences, including the highly sensual moment when Rose invites Jack to draw her portrait or the (much parodied) scene of the two lovers embracing at the front of the ship as it skims the water. For detractors that claim that the special effects involving the sinking of the Titanic save the film, it makes their argument untenable when so many audiences have already been won over long before the sinking begins. The climactic moments are intense, heart-breaking and unforgettable.The majority of the film's success (aside from Cameron) must be attributed to the leads. I would never have previously cast them as a couple, but DiCaprio and Winslet have chemistry. Not just any chemistry, but the chemistry of which cinematic legends are made. Winslet provides a warm, sympathetic and resonant presence throughout the film portraying a character that proves much stronger than even she initially believes. She draws you into the action and her final moments rank as some of her best acting. Conversely, although I admit DiCaprio is a good actor, I am not usually much of a fan. Here, I cannot see anyone else in this role. It is a distinct departure from anything else that he has attempted and he has no acting hook on which to hinge his work. Playing a larger-than-life character that clicks with the audience is one of the trickiest obstacles, but when Rose declares that he saved me in every way that a person can be saved DiCaprio makes you believe it. The fact that he makes it appear so effortless probably resulted in his Oscar nomination snub, but the truth is that he is definitely the worthy Gable to Winslet's Leigh.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"29 November 2006","score":"","review":" OK, so Freddy is back, never mind how, that's rarely the point in these kind of flicks. Back too is Kirsten, the girl with Freddy in her dreams. Sadly though, amazing Patricia Arquette from the previous movie has been replaced by horribly bad actress Tuesday Knight. The plot is simple enough Freddy returns to kill all the teenagers he can get his hands on, including the three remaining kids of No 3. When Kirsten dies her ability to draw other people into her dreams pass on to another girl, who of course gets all her friends killed and, naturally, kills Freddy in the end. Nevertheless, this film is the commercially most successful film in the Nightmare series, so you'd think there'd be at least some dots of light. And there are. The directing is very nice from a strictly technical point of view. Director Renny Harlin is a master camera operator and knows his special effects. There are some fairly original killings in this one, such as being trapped in your water bed and being turned into a cockroach. For the 80ies standard, the FX are well executed and some of the scenes are very pleasing to the eye. Robert Englund as Freddy is, as always, brilliant. This time he gets the opportunity to be really sadistic and humorous. Sadly, this is where the positive adjectives stop. I frankly didn't have the power to watch the movie to the end. It was simply too boring. The actors are all disastrously bad. There is not a single glimpse of light among the cast, and this is the true horror of the film. The characters are pointless and flat, which doesn't help. The plot is obvious and has very little to offer in the way of suspense and the film is in no way scary. It just isn't enough to have a creepy villain who kills people, no matter how good he is (I don't care how many teens he kills, Freddy does save this film).

You can see the way Disney used to make movies for children...the sets, the costumes, the character actors, the dialogue...even the music are all kid-friendly.There aren't that many modern movies from Disney that I would let children see, but I can almost always trust the ones made before 1984 (basically a legal decision happened in that year that allowed corporate infiltration into the creative process...1984 is pretty much the year that the USA started to really go downhill as far as business ethics in the movie industry as well as other big corporations targeting children as cash cows). Apple Dumpling Gang wasn't meant to be a huge blockbuster success with corporate sponsorship and marketing agendas, it is a film made by a company who knew and loved kids and made movies to entertain them and their parents at the same time. It is full of nostalgia.I highly recommend it for everyone!!! Oh, and Don Knotts, Tim Conway, and Bill Bixby are comic geniuses!!!

In the end it just ends up being a bit of a mess. The lesbian angle got most of the attention when the film came out but the fact the two lovers here both happen to be women almost seems beside the point by the end. It's almost as if halfway through the filmmakers said, OK let's drop the lesbian stuff and turn this into a crime caper. The movie goes off in all kinds of different directions and the whole thing never really comes together and holds your interest.Jennifer Tilly as Violet and Gina Gershon as Corky play the lovers in question here and there are a few sparks between the two but nothing is ever really sustained. The whole relationship seems rather forced and the performers, Tilly especially, never seem entirely comfortable in their roles. The best performance in the film comes from Joe Pantoliano, who plays Violet's rather oblivious mobster boyfriend Caesar, who never seems to notice that his girlfriend is more interested in Corky than she is in him. Eventually things will start to go badly for Caesar when a rather large sum of money goes missing. Watching Pantoliano's full-blown freak-out is about the best thing the film has to offer. As for why the money goes missing, suffice to say there is plenty of back-stabbing and double-crossing. There is meant to be a great deal of suspense but there really isn't.
