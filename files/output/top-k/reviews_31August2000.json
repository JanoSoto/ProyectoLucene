That's a great attribute- making the most of your life and living it! With that attribute why did I feel a little patronised, and then why did Patch Adams, the character, eventually become irritating?!The reason I found it patronising, I guess- is because I felt Tom Shadyac and the writers could of showed Patch actually saving a life instead of just making people laugh! Or maybe it was because Patch Adams jerked the system from the beginning and was so righteous! I don't know, I felt something was truly missing in this film- it just didn't gel for me! I really like Robin Williams but he was mis-cast in this film even though he played the role sufficiently! He was basically a big kid in this film, but he was less annoying in Jack!Bob Gunton and Philip Seymour Hoffman were also very good, and plus there was some excellent lines throughout and some very funny moments! But this was no Dead Poets Society! Patch Adams wouldn't rank high compared to the other numerous Robin Williams ventures I've seen! The moral of the film was great but I wish Patch Adams had a flaw or two (considering the film was based on a book written by the actual Patch Adams), and I wish they actually showed some of his skills! If you want to see a poignant film about a doctor\/patient relationship, see The Doctor! I won't say I dislike Patch Adams, the theme and some moments were great! It just seemed a little phony, and really tries to pull the heart-strings!That aside, Patch Adams is fairly light-hearted comedy\/drama that is worth a look. Tom Shadyac's other films; Ace Ventura Pet Detective and Liar Liar are better! I'll give Patch Adams a *** out of *****!

Bullet-tooth Tony is Big Chris practically no change to the character.  Brad Pitt is very good as Mikey and Benicio del Toro is good as Frankie Four-fingers.  I kinda hoped for better from Guy Ritchie for a second film but who knows he might do better with his third although a break from a London-set gangster film might be in order.  And to the guy who thought the fight sequences were better than Fight Club, GET WITH IT, this film, good as it was, is not a patch on the excellent Fight Club.

This story has more holes than a colander and it gets more ludicrous as it progresses.It starts out well plausibly enough.  Upon release from prison, Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck) impersonates his cellmate Nick (James Frain) in order to get with Ashley (Chalene Theron), his lovely pen-pal girlfriend.  After a short frolic, Ashley's evil brother Gabriel (Gary Sinise) and his thugs kidnap Rudy, thinking he is Nick.  It seems Nick once worked as a security guard in a casino that the thugs want to rob.  The film is intriguing to here, but a succession of dubious situations and plot twists mar what started out as a good setup.Ehren Kruger has given us some good scripts (Scream 3, Arlington Road), but in this story he tried to be a little too clever and it bombed.  There was a lot of exceptionally bad dialogue.  Rudy had at least two opportunities to make a clean getaway and decided not to.  Various bad guys had at least half a dozen chances to kill Rudy after he had outlived his usefulness, but they all decided it would be better to talk with him for a while to give him time to figure out how to wriggle out of it.  There were so many holes in the plot, Kruger felt compelled to try to patch it up with explanatory dialogue near the end.  The ending was so far beyond inconceivable that it bordered on moronic.Director John Frankenheimer did a very nice job with the camera, giving us a great variety of innovative perspective shots, and pacing the film well. The action scenes and stunts were also well done.The acting was terrific by the entire cast.  It is a pity that they didn't have better material.  Gary Sinise was nefarious and slimy as Ashley's evil brother.  Chalize Theron was wonderfully duplicitous as Ashley, all dewy eyed with Rudy at first, then playing the helpless victim, and later as the cold-hearted woman with the pistol in her hand.  That was quite a range and she was fabulous in just about every scene.  Ben Affleck might have been a little too nice to be Rudy.  Though he was only a car thief, he just didn't seem much like a convict.  Still, he has good screen presence, and he carried the role off pretty well.I rated this film a 6\/10.  I subtracted three points for the dubious plot and another point for the absurd ending.  The acting and directing were marvelous, but the story was so flawed that it couldn't be redeemed.
