Nevertheless, he pulls out shots which are so luminous and well constructed that they make you gasp, and all done on a digital betacam!  This makes BVSC one of the few documentaries I have ever seen which must be seen on the big screen to be fully appreciated. Although I've never been to Havana, it also appeared to me that Wenders may have judged well in his balance by showing Havana as a poor broken down city and not just a place full of '50s cars, grand old buildings and omnipresent faded glory.The stars of the film are the old folks, of course.  In some ways, the point of the film is not music - this could have been a film about people from any field. Instead, this is simply a record of what people have to say looking back on experiences from their lives which we can never repeat.Perhaps there was a slight temptation at editing stage to steer the film towards certain themes.  There was without a doubt rather a lot of places where the intended conclusion of the audience seemed to be wow - old men can be cheeky... and they still have libidos!, but maybe only they can say whether the men themselves consider the film to be a fair reflection of the whole of their personalities, and I doubt we will ever find out.Two points about the musical side.  First, I continue to worry about Ry Cooder and his son Joaquim.  Do they really need to be there?  Ferrer and the old timers all kept tight lipped about Ry's slide guitar, NOT, I thought a prerequisite instrument of the average Cuban son band, and dare I say it, distractingly awful in at least one place in the film.  Can't comment so much about Joaquim's style when playing the drums, but there must surely be some 50-90 year old cuban drummer cursing his luck that he isn't in on the party thanks to Cooder Jr.?Second, what do Ferrer et al think about the music they are making now? How does it compare to how they considered they performed in decades gone by? Might they freely admit (as I suspect, honest and carefree as they clearly are) that they are reproducing now something which they did a lot better when they were younger?  The question was never asked.It's a tough point to make, but the average son singer does not I imagine consider at the outset of his career that he will only be hitting his peak in his eighth or ninth decade!  If they do admit to having had a golden period in the past, why did Wenders not let us see footage of some of that. I doubt if any but a few of his audience have any knowledge of the Cuban music of the 40s and 50s so as to judge with any accuracy what merit there is in the music they are creating today.  And without that, the risk is that the players are being cheered not for their musical skills but merely as museum pieces and for the fact that they are capable of doing it at their age at all.  I had the slightly uneasy feeling by the end of the film that Wenders might have excluded old footage on the basis that it would show up the modern recordings as something less than the genre at its best.You should go and see it and then tell me why I am wrong on those points, which hardly dent my rating for this as a definite 9+!

It didn't really seem to have a major reading on my I must go see this movie meter.  But, I'm glad a couple friends did want to see it and dragged me out along for the ride.  Having seen it I can say that I would have been sorry to have missed such fine performances.Kevin Spacey is the central character in this black comedy\/drama as the henpecked, overworked, and verging on middle-aged Lester Burnham .  The narrative at the beginning tells you that he was murdered, but who did it is almost incidental in comparison to everything that happens to him before that point. Somewhere in his past, he gave up his dreams and his ability to fight for them in exchange for status quo and a comfortable home.  His success-driven, bitch-on-wheels wife, Carolyn Burnham is played by Annette Bening.  Her portrayal of a Stepford Wife-like real estate agent who seems to do everything just right is soon revealed as a woman on the verge of some kind of breakdown every 5 minutes.The dysfunctional couple does have a daughter, Jane (played by Thora Burch) who is smack dab in the middle of her The entire world is evil&#133;..and so I will be too brooding adolescent phase.  You can't help but be sympathetic, however, when her parents are more interested in quarreling with each other than they are in just talking to their only child.  This role is a Grand Canyon-sized departure for Thora Burch, who has, until this point, been the pint-sized and pig-tailed, cute-as-a-button kid in various roles since she was 6 years old.  If you look past the grunge-look dye job in this movie, you might recognize her as playing the daughter to Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan character in two different Tom Clancy movies from years past.Things get really interesting in this story when new neighbors move in next door.  Teenaged video voyeur, Ricky Fitts (played by Wes Bentley) becomes drawn to his introverted and intriguing neighbor-girl, Jane.  Although seeming a bit on the strange side, he does have an eye for interesting visuals that is a bit intriguing.  What's more intriguing though, is his double life between playing the dutiful son to his Marine Colonel father and almost catatonic mother and yet secretly dealing high-end pot out of his dresser drawer to any and all with the means to purchase it.The final pieces are put into place when Spacey's character falls head over heels for a beautiful Barbie doll on his daughter's cheerleading squad, and frightens everyone around him as he starts changing his attitude and his life.  It's terribly uplifting and somehow freeing to watch him liberate himself from a job he hates, a life he's bored with, and a middle-aged body he's neglected.  There are some seriously funny moments where you look at the screen and think boy, I wish I had the guts to do that.While some might consider some of the points to be a bit romanticized, I don't think that there's one of us who doesn't know these people or, even more frightening,  isn't one of them ourselves.  This movie is graced with some wonderful filming visuals that actually make a 40-something year old man's crush on a teenager a romantic rather than lustful concept.  He's not in love with her body, per se, but the whole idea of actually being the man that a girl like that could be in love with.  Spacey's performance in this is truly superb, and is alone worth an exorbitant movie ticket price.  I smell multiple Oscars in this movie's future.

But the fact that the Son'a were falling apart was original, and their attempts to make themselves look better (flesh stretching sessions, genetic manipulating), the mere fact that these people were falling apart!

This movie is not a Matrix clone.  Matrix is science fantasy.  Thirteenth Floor looks at something that is theoretically possible in the future.  This is a very deep movie.  Its only down side is that it is a very difficult movie to make and comprehend. Just try to think about it for a second.Computer simulations have been around for a while now.  You can simulate wars to work out strategies, you can simulate aircraft for flight training, you can simulate explosions to work out the resulting damage.  The list is endless.  You have played video games at some point in time have'nt you? Well when you think about it most games are basically simulations, be it flight simulator, FIFA 99, quake, doom, red alert etc.As computing power increases, the quality, realism and accuracy of simulations is improving all the time.  At the moment, characters in a game fake 'intelligence'.  Say you fire a gun in a game like quake, an enemy 'hears' you turns around and shoots back.  A character in a game falls on the ground and holds his arm where he has just been shot.  But he is not programmed to feel pain, or to bleed or to fear his own death.  But what if he was?Now say we approach such a level of programming, that characters in a computer simulation are programmed with real intelligence and awareness, their world is fully programmed to appear, feel, smell and touch as real to them, as our world does to us.  Say we want to see the reaction of the people of a city to a nuclear leak at a power plant.  We create a city with a power plant on the outskirts, populate (program) this simulated city with simulated people and objects from the sub-nuclear level right up to frozen pizza.  These simulated people move and think independently within this environment.  They sleep, eat, have sex, go to school, steal and watch television.  They breathe what to them is air, they 'think'.  They worry about bills, jobs, security, money, the weather, traffic jams...'.  Then we program the nuclear leak, sit back and watch as these poor characters run for their lives!Now are there any ethics to creating such a simulation?  Are we responsible for their continued existence?  Are they 'real'?  I think therefore, I am. Well if they did 'think' then are they? What if Microsoft or Electronic Arts brought out 'Virtual World 2050' for Windows?  You slot in your CD, enter setup and create a world on your system full of 'intelligent' characters in their own world.  Perhaps a better name for this game would be GOD 2050 for Windows, because as far as these characters are concerned, that is what you would be.How about input\/output methods?  Keyboards, mouse and pen pointers, voice recognition, monitors and VR sets?  Our brain waves, senses and optic images are made up of impulses.  Isnt it theoretically possible to link up to a computer so that what we feel, sense and see is computer generated?  Say this interface disengages your senses and links you to one of the characters in a simulation so that you now feel, sense and see what this character does in his virtual reality world.The problem with this movie is that when you really think about it, this subject is difficult to comprehend because unlike timetravel (impossible), space travel (nothing can travel faster than the speed of light so forget about the warp drive and space exploration) and alien invasions (is there really anyone out there?) it will happen and may create more of an uproar than genetic engineering.  You can either make something spectacularly outlandish (like Matrix) or realistic?  You cannot do both.Another problem with this concept is that it is virtually impossible for a virtual character to figure out for himself that he is simulated.  The bits where these characters drive to the end of their simulations are pretty stupid.  But how can a simulated character find out that he is a simulation in a simulated world?  If you program a world well enough, your characters will never know.  You could throw earthquakes, hailstorms, a solar eclipse everyday, even keyboards raining from the sky and these poor characters would just watch scared, helpless and totally confused.And one day you find that you are running out of hard disk space and you decide to delete the virtual world on your system?  Would you or would'nt you?  What if your own world was simulated? What if you were a simulated character?  How would you react to finding out that you were just a simulated character?   How would you react to finding out that your existence was totally at the mercy of a programmer who is just a mortal? Would life loose its meaning?I was intensely dissappointed with 'The Matrix', mainly because I was expecting this very issue that has been taken up by 'The Thirteenth Floor'. For me 'The Matrix' was a spectacular special effects show with stylised slow motion shots, and cool techno music.  As far as substance was concerned 'The Matrix' was pure nonsense.  It had no hole in the story as the story itself was a hole.  If this world is simulated and the real one has us all kept alive in incubators by some evil life form then stuff reality, I'll stay right here thank you.  Also if this world is a simulation then the programmers have complete control.  No need to send in 'Men in Black' lookalikes (and why not send in three hundred instead of 3), no use running around looking for telephones.  The programmer just has to run Norton antivirus.  Similar mistakes are made in Thirteenth floor, but only become apparent when you think about them.  For instance if you are a simulation and you find out the truth, so what? You can never pose any threat to your programmers?  No need to download and kill the simulated character.The atmosphere of the movie is right as it deals with a serious issue like self awareness.  The acting is suited to the movie, sober.  The romance could have been toned down or left out but the supermarket checkout scene is beautifully done and is very touching (only if you think about whats happening and realise what Douglas Hall is realising) and the ending could have been much much better.  What if the movie ended with the simulated worlds being switched off?  No more school from tomorrow.  This is a movie, not a special effects extravaganza with hyperactive gun toting heroes saying 'lets kick some ass'.I figured out exactly where the story was leading as soon as Fuller came out of the 1930's simulation into the 'real' world.  It does not take much genius to work it out.  It is really difficult to fool people nowadays or keep people in suspense.  In 'Saving Private Ryan' everyone knew that the first Ryan was the wrong one, in 'Seven' everyone knew what was being delivered in the FedEx van.  But I wanted to see how things unfold.If you like to use your brain now and then, you will love this movie, as I did.  Also if you tend not to be influenced by hype and publicity, you may appreciate this movie.  I think that this movie could easily have been a classic.  I am a science fiction fan and I was intruiged.  I read Stanley Kubrik, Arthur C. Clark and other sci-fi novelists.  My favourite sci-fi movies are Blade Runner, Contact, 2001.  Non sci-fi favourites are The Shawshank Redemption, ANTZ, Some like it hot.  For me 'The Matrix' and 'Phantom Menace' were incredibly overated.  A movie is not just about special effects and a bunch of hip overconfident cocky characters wearing Raybans in the dark.I was definetely a minority when I loved 'The Shawshank Redemption' and everyone was calling it crap, and the same looks true here too.  I'll give 'The Thirteenth Floor' 8\/10.

Similar mistakes are made in Thirteenth floor, but only become apparent when you think about them.  For instance if you are a simulation and you find out the truth, so what? You can never pose any threat to your programmers?  No need to download and kill the simulated character.The atmosphere of the movie is right as it deals with a serious issue like self awareness.  The acting is suited to the movie, sober.  The romance could have been toned down or left out but the supermarket checkout scene is beautifully done and is very touching (only if you think about whats happening and realise what Douglas Hall is realising) and the ending could have been much much better.  What if the movie ended with the simulated worlds being switched off?  No more school from tomorrow.  This is a movie, not a special effects extravaganza with hyperactive gun toting heroes saying 'lets kick some ass'.I figured out exactly where the story was leading as soon as Fuller came out of the 1930's simulation into the 'real' world.  It does not take much genius to work it out.  It is really difficult to fool people nowadays or keep people in suspense.  In 'Saving Private Ryan' everyone knew that the first Ryan was the wrong one, in 'Seven' everyone knew what was being delivered in the FedEx van.  But I wanted to see how things unfold.If you like to use your brain now and then, you will love this movie, as I did.  Also if you tend not to be influenced by hype and publicity, you may appreciate this movie.  I think that this movie could easily have been a classic.  I am a science fiction fan and I was intruiged.  I read Stanley Kubrik, Arthur C. Clark and other sci-fi novelists.  My favourite sci-fi movies are Blade Runner, Contact, 2001.  Non sci-fi favourites are The Shawshank Redemption, ANTZ, Some like it hot.  For me 'The Matrix' and 'Phantom Menace' were incredibly overated.  A movie is not just about special effects and a bunch of hip overconfident cocky characters wearing Raybans in the dark.I was definetely a minority when I loved 'The Shawshank Redemption' and everyone was calling it crap, and the same looks true here too.  I'll give 'The Thirteenth Floor' 8\/10.

This movie is not a Matrix clone.  Matrix is science fantasy.  Thirteenth Floor looks at something that is theoretically possible in the future.  This is a very deep movie.  Its only down side is that it is a very difficult movie to make and comprehend. Just try to think about it for a second.Computer simulations have been around for a while now.  You can simulate wars to work out strategies, you can simulate aircraft for flight training, you can simulate explosions to work out the resulting damage.  The list is endless.  You have played video games at some point in time have'nt you? Well when you think about it most games are basically simulations, be it flight simulator, FIFA 99, quake, doom, red alert etc.As computing power increases, the quality, realism and accuracy of simulations is improving all the time.  At the moment, characters in a game fake 'intelligence'.  Say you fire a gun in a game like quake, an enemy 'hears' you turns around and shoots back.  A character in a game falls on the ground and holds his arm where he has just been shot.  But he is not programmed to feel pain, or to bleed or to fear his own death.  But what if he was?Now say we approach such a level of programming, that characters in a computer simulation are programmed with real intelligence and awareness, their world is fully programmed to appear, feel, smell and touch as real to them, as our world does to us.  Say we want to see the reaction of the people of a city to a nuclear leak at a power plant.  We create a city with a power plant on the outskirts, populate (program) this simulated city with simulated people and objects from the sub-nuclear level right up to frozen pizza.  These simulated people move and think independently within this environment.  They sleep, eat, have sex, go to school, steal and watch television.  They breathe what to them is air, they 'think'.  They worry about bills, jobs, security, money, the weather, traffic jams...'.  Then we program the nuclear leak, sit back and watch as these poor characters run for their lives!Now are there any ethics to creating such a simulation?  Are we responsible for their continued existence?  Are they 'real'?  I think therefore, I am. Well if they did 'think' then are they? What if Microsoft or Electronic Arts brought out 'Virtual World 2050' for Windows?  You slot in your CD, enter setup and create a world on your system full of 'intelligent' characters in their own world.  Perhaps a better name for this game would be GOD 2050 for Windows, because as far as these characters are concerned, that is what you would be.How about input\/output methods?  Keyboards, mouse and pen pointers, voice recognition, monitors and VR sets?  Our brain waves, senses and optic images are made up of impulses.  Isnt it theoretically possible to link up to a computer so that what we feel, sense and see is computer generated?  Say this interface disengages your senses and links you to one of the characters in a simulation so that you now feel, sense and see what this character does in his virtual reality world.The problem with this movie is that when you really think about it, this subject is difficult to comprehend because unlike timetravel (impossible), space travel (nothing can travel faster than the speed of light so forget about the warp drive and space exploration) and alien invasions (is there really anyone out there?) it will happen and may create more of an uproar than genetic engineering.  You can either make something spectacularly outlandish (like Matrix) or realistic?  You cannot do both.Another problem with this concept is that it is virtually impossible for a virtual character to figure out for himself that he is simulated.  The bits where these characters drive to the end of their simulations are pretty stupid.  But how can a simulated character find out that he is a simulation in a simulated world?  If you program a world well enough, your characters will never know.  You could throw earthquakes, hailstorms, a solar eclipse everyday, even keyboards raining from the sky and these poor characters would just watch scared, helpless and totally confused.And one day you find that you are running out of hard disk space and you decide to delete the virtual world on your system?  Would you or would'nt you?  What if your own world was simulated? What if you were a simulated character?  How would you react to finding out that you were just a simulated character?   How would you react to finding out that your existence was totally at the mercy of a programmer who is just a mortal? Would life loose its meaning?I was intensely dissappointed with 'The Matrix', mainly because I was expecting this very issue that has been taken up by 'The Thirteenth Floor'. For me 'The Matrix' was a spectacular special effects show with stylised slow motion shots, and cool techno music.  As far as substance was concerned 'The Matrix' was pure nonsense.  It had no hole in the story as the story itself was a hole.  If this world is simulated and the real one has us all kept alive in incubators by some evil life form then stuff reality, I'll stay right here thank you.  Also if this world is a simulation then the programmers have complete control.  No need to send in 'Men in Black' lookalikes (and why not send in three hundred instead of 3), no use running around looking for telephones.  The programmer just has to run Norton antivirus.

I can't believe why so much was cut out of that one. Personally, I think Aliens is Cameron's second best work so far. And a certain very well known three-hour ocean epic is in the lead.

As a matter of fact, James Cameron has only made two big mistakes in his career 1) The directing of Piranha II The Spawning (I haven't seen that one, but you don't need to see it to know it's crap) and 2) Writing parts of the script to Rambo First Blood Part II (which by my opinion is one of the very worst films ever made).
