Then it's 1929 and the depression is starting, but one guy is doing well- Based on information he brought back from 2004!

He was able to fake us out in several very Paul Verhooven-ish style violence scenes- Crook getting frozen and then breaking in half, Electrocutions, shootings, disintegrations, etc.The plot follows Van Damme and Bruce McGill (Jack Dalton from MacGuver) through several nightmare permutations of events in time- Until finally Van Damme helps Van Damme.And the ending is your typical Please God, Make it Never Happened thing.Seeing how this moovie actually is rated around 7\/10 in the IMDb scale, that means it fared well with most people who see it.It's a good moovie, if you like moovies, the locations are great, the LOOK of the movie is interesting, the gadgets do not look like props stolen from Star Trek or purchased at Radio Shack, and there are a few very cool special effects. Plus, it is NON STOP action from practically the beginning.

The catastrophe was caused by a religious\/nationalist group called the Holnists. After the war, the surviving humans in the former united states form little settlements to survive, but are daily terrorized and ruled over by the remaining Holnist army. A vagabond (Kevin Costner) is first captured by them to be conscripted in their army, but manages to escape. He finds refuge in a town called Pineview where he poses as a postman of the reformed US (which is a lie he fabricates to get food) but the people of the town fill with hope and make his lie reality. Soon, a whole postal service is organized which poses a threat to the Holnist regime.The idea of the film is a pretty good one. I generally like the genre of post-apocalyptic films, but this one would be by far my favourite, if it only had a mildly better director. Kevin Costner took Waterworld (1995) and decided to set it on land. The difference is that in this one, the action is very scarce and the drama much more. That would be a good thing, if every scene was not constantly overdramatized. Instead of watching how the rebellious postmen fought against the Holnists, we just see how Kevin Costner's character feels guilt at every turn for getting people killed. Again, it's not a bad thing to show this, but if it takes the whole of the film, then it becomes boring, especially since the film goes on for 3 hours. 3 hours is too long to just talk about one thing considering only one character, when you have a far more interesting story running in the background. The point of the film should have been how the little lie Costner said to the people of Pineview got out of proportions and spread into a rebellion, which would convey a lot of good messages, and would have been more interesting. An example of how bad the background war story was undersized in expense for the guilt story of the Postman, is the last scene (SPOILER ALERT) where the Holnist leader the The Postman fight for leadership of the Holnist army, but the fight only takes a few seconds and seems very unimportant compared to other parts of the movie where Kevin Costner tries to stop his lie from spreading.Also, I hated, as I stated above, the overdramatization of a lot of scenes, especially the scene where the boy goes out the house to hand Costner a letter. I don't like films (especially in the 90s where this used to be tradition) that have an orchestral uplifting and inspiring theme song running throughout the film without pause. Especially in a post-apocalyptic film, where everything is supposed to be grim, a director should choose very carefully what kind of music he uses and where he uses it. Take for example, Children of Men, where the music is very rare throughout the film and the director there uses silence or ambient background noise to convey the feeling of catastrophe and misery that overtakes that timeline.In general, watch it if you want, it's not a bad film and is kind of inspiring in some parts, but if it had a better direction it could have been a masterpiece.

An example of how bad the background war story was undersized in expense for the guilt story of the Postman, is the last scene (SPOILER ALERT) where the Holnist leader the The Postman fight for leadership of the Holnist army, but the fight only takes a few seconds and seems very unimportant compared to other parts of the movie where Kevin Costner tries to stop his lie from spreading.Also, I hated, as I stated above, the overdramatization of a lot of scenes, especially the scene where the boy goes out the house to hand Costner a letter. I don't like films (especially in the 90s where this used to be tradition) that have an orchestral uplifting and inspiring theme song running throughout the film without pause. Especially in a post-apocalyptic film, where everything is supposed to be grim, a director should choose very carefully what kind of music he uses and where he uses it. Take for example, Children of Men, where the music is very rare throughout the film and the director there uses silence or ambient background noise to convey the feeling of catastrophe and misery that overtakes that timeline.In general, watch it if you want, it's not a bad film and is kind of inspiring in some parts, but if it had a better direction it could have been a masterpiece. Also, be warned it goes on for 3 hours ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"26 February 2012","score":"16 out of 19 people found the following review useful","review":" Session 9 is directed by Brad Anderson who also co-writes the screenplay with Stephen Gevedon.

Built in 1874, opened in 1878 and closed in 1992. The home to misery, madness, tragedies and troubling treatments. Five men from an asbestos removal company, each with issues or points to prove, enter the vast bat shaped structure under the promise of a big pay off to get the job done in one week. But over the course of the week money will be the last thing on their minds.Psychological horror at its finest, Session 9, in the hands of Brad Anderson, pretty much gets everything right in this most skin itching of sub-genres. Like the ghost story splinter of horror, setting is absolutely everything, and few, if any? Horror settings are as imposing or eerie as the one time Danvers State Hospital. Sadly demolished in 2006\/7 to make way for an apartment complex (bastard property developers have no respect outside of the purse), the place positively oozes unease throughout the movie. With Anderson choosing to shoot his film on videotape, this further aids the sense of realism and palpable dread, and although it isn't a stretch of the mind to think about some of the misery that played out in reality at Danvers, Anderson and his photographer Briesewitz ensure that it never leaves our conscious. Tone is set from the off as being slow burn, this is perfect as it allows us to get a grasp of the characters, their psychological make ups and narrative worth.With the Danvers facility proving to be the extra character, all things come together seamlessly to gnaw away at the viewers. It's a devilishly odd thing to say, but as the story and characters are given room to breath, the audience who have immersed themselves in the picture will start to feel claustrophobic, and then for the night time sequences, even achluophobic. It's pitch perfect pacing by Anderson, who prior to unleashing the unnerving finale, has pulled us (and his excellent cast) slowly through a labyrinth of dank corridors, wards, treatment rooms, caged stairwells and a morgue. Even on the outside during daylight hours everything feels bleak, either with characters loomed over by the building, or on a roof chatting while Gothic turrets watch over them menacingly, the ghosts and bitterness of Danvers Hospital exist fully in Anderson's movie.Story links a tape recording found by Mike (Gevedon) with that of the workers' unfolding plight. The tape tells of 9 sessions with a troubled patient named Mary Hobbes, to say anymore would be spoilerish, but for the record in this writers eyes it's the creepiest tape recording in horrorville. Add in the odd hospital prop such as a lone wheelchair, a hydrotherapy bath or an orbitoclast! Well you get the picture I'm sure. Climax Golden Twins provide a suitably jarring score, where disjointed noises and elongated tonal strains further enhance the pervading disquiet. Picture only falls down slightly with silly plot error involving a furnace, and for some folk the ending will inevitably be met with dissatisfaction. I liked it plenty but I also feel they could have gone another way with it. But it does work well and isn't a cop out, and certainly it's better than the alternate ending available in the extras section of home disc formats.It's a horror film aimed at a certain horror fan, the one who has the patience to enjoy slow burn psychological pin prickery.

The film's influenced by Cecil B. DeMille's epics (The Crusades, The Sign of the Cross), and Italian\/Hollywood sword-and-sandal movies (Spartacus, Ben Hur, The Fall of the Roman Empire, El Cid, Barabbas, Demetrius and the Gladiators etc), all films Scott adored as a child. As with Scott's other historical epics (Conquest of Paradise, Robin Hood and Kingdom of Heaven), artwork and paintings the director came across as an art student seem to be a big influence, in this case the works of Jean-Leon Gerome (Scott's acknowledged Gerome's Pollice Verso as the reason he decided to direct Gladiator), 19th century Orientalists, Charles Gleyre, Caravaggio and Delaroche.Of course the chief pleasure of any Scott movie is his emulation of famous painters and\/or print artists. Think Blade Runner's nods to Edward Hopper, Enki Bilal and Jean Giraud (Moebius), Alien's reliance on Giger's Necronomicon, and The Duellist's nods to Caspar David Friedrich and Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon's, another painterly film, though Kubrick subverts the idyllic charms of Gainsborough and Watteau, whereas Scott goes for straight Romanticism (his final shot's a direct copy of Friedrich's Wanderer above the Sea of Fog). The problem, though, is that Scott's images can never touch any of these other artists. Worse still, they're always aligned to silly screenplays.Gladiator stars Russell Crowe as Maximus, the Roman general asked by the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius to take over as ruler of Rome. Before he is granted power, however, the emperor's tyrannical son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix, playing Commodus with severe daddy issues), orders the execution of Maximus and his family. Maximus survives, and embarks on a quest for vengeance. The film watches as Maximus falls from general to slave, rises from slave to gladiator and finally from gladiator to brave warrior who dares defy an emperor. The film ends with Maximus given a messianic, Braveheart\/Spartacus inspired slow death.Great visuals and sequences are scattered about, but Scott's CGI lacks the gravity of even the FX work DeMille did a century earlier, the film is surprisingly stiff for an action epic, Gladiator's adherence to old Hollywood storytelling, spectacle and violence makes it an immediately dated affair and Scott's dialogue reads like a bad stage-play (Sometimes I do what I want to do, the rest of the time I do what I have to), devoid of depth, nuance or wit. The film's overall tone is a cross between a WWF wrestling match and a perfume commercial, Scott dressing things up in a New Age score, gauzy filters, long focal lenses, ubiquitous smoke, flares and mist. It's Braveheart with less camp value. Like DeMille, what you mostly marvel at is the sheer scale of the production, though in our era of excess, such logistics have lost much of their weight.Hollywood isn't known for treating history seriously, but Gladiator is funny in the way it bulldozes yesteryear. The film ends with the fictional Maximus killing the real Emperor Commodus in gladiatorial combat, a mano-a-mano scenario that's the equivalent of Indiana Jones killing Hitler in a game of ping pong. Lucilla, the sister of Commodus (who had actually been executed at the beginning of Commodus' reign), then announces that Rome will honor Maximus by reversing Commodus' despotism and restoring the greatness of the Republic. What the hell? The film somehow manages to turn Maximus' death (lots of Christian and crucification iconography) into a hero dying for the sins of Rome narrative, Maximus' death steering a resurrected Rome away from corruption and toward its supposedly saintly, Republican origins (historically, it was when Rome became a Republic that it turned into a psycho-expanding Empire, and it was as a Republic, and not while under dictatorial rule, that she was at her most bloody). You saw the same thing years ago with British Imperial nostalgia, Britain romanticising its colonial achievements and declaring them a proper source of pride, and today in the US with desires for strict constitutionalists and a return to those good old days. You know, when you could own a slave and scalp Injuns. So by the film's end, Gladiator has turned the historical fall of the Roman Empire into Rome's purification and rebirth via the true warrior son of a departed Emperor nobly returning and replacing a bad, fake, fascist Emperor. Cue psycho-expansionist George Bush Jr's coincidental ascension to the throne the same year Scott's film was released. It's what daddy wanted.End result a violent Hollywood spectacle about the violent spectacle of gladiatorial combat, which makes fun of art which panders to the mob, whilst nevertheless glorifying violence, glory, honor and the prosperity of Roman Imperialism. Note the way the simple, bare-bones existence of Maximus (the guy literally rallies his troops by stressing his love for simple, subsidence farming) is contrasted with Commodus' extravagance. Commodus may prove that the dumb masses only enjoy bread and circus antics, but Maximus trumps this by gaining support through the universal love for the simple, martial virtues that supposedly made Rome great. These virtues were more heroically illustrated by the Germanic fighters and Celtic tribes (ironic Gladiator catapulted Celtic singer Enya to super-stardom), quickly slaughtered by Scott, who were defending themselves against Rome at the beginning of the film. 7.5\/10 - Worth two viewings.

And the mystery surrounding the characters is so absorbing that it immediately plunges us into such an unnerving and harrowing atmosphere that at the end of the film, whether we found relief or our hearts were still pounding, we know we'd just have lived an extraordinary experience.The Others is set in a large mansion inhabited by a young mother, Nicole Kidman as Grace Stewart and her two children, Anne and Nicholas. The film opens when she receives three applicants for house jobs, an elderly tacit grounds-keeper named Mr Turkle, a deaf and dumb adolescent, and the lady who seems to lead the group, Bertha Mills, played, in a remarkable performance, by Fionula Fllanigan. Mrs Mills is the kind of character that immediately strikes the viewer as very competent in her job while the eventuality of her vileness is better conveyed by the peculiarity of her workmates. what's more, Mrs Mills' personality, very calm and professional, efficiently contrasts with Grace's more natural behavior as a loving and caring mother, trying to hide her excitability behind a mask of aristocratic-like composure.It's hard to figure the period of the film until Grace mentions that her husband is fighting in Europe it's WWII, the film is set in a mysterious foggy island in Britain, and we ought to believe her. Now, why would the mother of two kids endure such a spooky location? the answer is immediately given, setting at the same time, the tone of the film. Her two kids suffer an extremely rare syndrome, they are photosensitive, which means they can't be exposed to sunlight without being victims of irremediable symptoms. Therefore the mansion's activity is driven by a special but indispensable routine implying to close all the doors with a key, whenever someone gets in or out. This information is vital, and plays as an interesting display of smart writing in the way it distracts us from many precocious interrogations, such as why are all the three servants dressed in a very old-fashion way.I mentioned in the early paragraph the atmosphere of the film and, no pun intended, it's indeed the key element that drives the film. The atmosphere is so intense that we don't need to be scared, because we constantly keep our guard up, it's the kind of situations so calm we know something will happen. Yet everything remains desperately quiet, and as the movie progresses, all we have are little doses of thrills, through apparitions, voices, screams, encounters with mysterious presences, and the macabre discovery of photographs showing dead people, but no death, no gore, no fights. The secret of The Others is to works as an efficient set-up whose sensational impact would ineivtably rely on the climax, so all we have to do is to be patient, and collect all the hints in order to know what to expect and this is what communicates the thrilling effect of the filmThe atmosphere is carried by a shadowy external photography and a powerful cinematography whose use of lights transforms the vastness of a mansion into a sum of little closed places, conveying the disturbing feeling of a suffocating paranoia. The house is so big yet feels so small while the mysterious and haunting presence of 'strangers' make the whole setting totally unsettling. And the force of the film is within the story as it features characters who are apparently forced to live in this mansion for vital reasons, and the satisfying resolution would either be a way to chase the others, or to be chased, but we all know the confrontation is inevitable. The Others' suspense works on a Hitchcockian level, even more effective because we really don't know what to expect, and take it from someone who saw it each time with different persons, no one ever guesses the ending, and neither did I.But it would be unfair and untrue to imply that The Others only works thanks to the ending, the narrative evolves around an emotional core within the story of a mother who tries to protect her two children. And the conflict in The Others is not just between two different kinds of presences in a same house, but the psychological consequence through the torment invading the heart of a woman, torn between her maternal instinct and a terrible secret belonging to the past and profoundly affecting the present. Nicole Kidman magnificently embodies the vulnerability of a woman left alone and totally alienated by too much responsibility. And Mrs Mills represents the perfect counterpart to Grace's hellish condition and while she gets closer to Anne, and Grace's behavior becomes more suspicious, the notion of vileness goes back and forth and we wait until the moment it will finally determine who the real antagonist is &#x85; if there ever is one.All in all, it's hard to know who is the straight person of this series of incidents when emotions are so powerfully engaged. The Others is a remarkable chronicle of a dramatic family story involving a woman and two kids, one strong-minded and free-spirited little girl and her poignantly coward little brother. The two kids, beautifully portrayed, mirror the same contrasts between Mrs Mills and Grace Stewart and what's more, their condition plays like the metaphor of Grace's symbolic sensitivity to an even blinding and painful light.

The deferential Lancaster begs one hundred dollars from Cypher for the innocent dead man's window. Cypher and the gang laugh at him and shoot holes in the wall against which he's standing. Lancaster pursues the matter and Cypher's gang beat him and tie him to a crucifix and send him off stumbling through the forest to die. Well -- he doesn't die. How COULD he die?

Then, Cypher and his group had better look out because Valdez is definitely coming. He digs out his old uniform and weapons from the time he was a cavalry trooper, hits and runs, kidnaps Tanner's girl friend, Susan Clark, and finally get the one hundred dollars for the widow.Frank Silvera's part isn't a big one but he's great at playing Mexicans. He was the gunslinger who finally offed Paul Newman in Apache. He's played African-Americans and Tahitians. He LOOKS ethnic. His father was a Spanish Jew and his mother was Jamaican.

They meet in school and become fast friends immediately. They create a secret fantasy world and become obsessive about it and each other. As their friendship grow, even bordering on homosexuality, and their fantasy land Borovnia seems real to them just as the real world outside, their parents grow concerned and try to separate the pair. Resenting this, they plan revenge on one of the mothers. Their form of revenge...ultimate...Murder!What sets the film apart is the fantasy world the girls create - the world named Borovnia.

Today morning, with nothing else to do, I decided watch this movie on youtube and felt I should be writing about this (one of the most) under-rated movies ever.Heavenly Creatures is made by the man who directed Lord of the Rings trilogy - Peter Jackson. The movie is about the famous 'Parker-Hulme Murder Case' where in Parker and Hulme, together murders Parker's mother, Peirse.Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme are two 14 year old girls played by Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey respectively. They meet in school and become fast friends immediately. They create a secret fantasy world and become obsessive about it and each other. As their friendship grow, even bordering on homosexuality, and their fantasy land Borovnia seems real to them just as the real world outside, their parents grow concerned and try to separate the pair. Resenting this, they plan revenge on one of the mothers. Their form of revenge...ultimate...Murder!What sets the film apart is the fantasy world the girls create - the world named Borovnia.

The direction and camera work attempt to capture the mess inside Bateman's head, drastically contrasting the atmosphere of the scenes, from a brutal murder scene, straight into massage therapy. By highlighting Batemans obsession with his outer self, it implies that society similarly tries to perfect its outer body to cover the guilt of the uncontrollable nature inside most of us.

It is more a thriller than a horror, but because the much talked-about 'Shower Scene' that has been ranked in many Scariest Scenes in History lists, those who haven't seen the movie presume that it is a horror movie. The movie ultimately will make you sweat with fear but won't make you scream as if bitten by a Sumatran rat-monkey, and some don't realize this but the filmmaker has succeeded in his attempt to invoke fear in your mind. On my first viewing, even I was quite disillusioned by the movie; it only improved on my subsequent viewings. Curse the Scariest Scenes in History list for creating that presumption. In fact, Oscar Awards create a different presumption about films &#x96; we expect a certain class and when the films, especially those nominated for the Best Picture award, don't stand up to the expectations, we are all the more disappointed. The case here Fatal Attraction.I was quite intrigued by the cover and the plot of the film. Not just that, the 'Oscar' mention raised expectations. A lot could have been explored about this subject, especially about Glenn Close's Alex Forest, because I was astonished to read the cases about Jodie Foster's and David Letterman's stalker and it also put me in wonder about what really happens to these people that they get so deviant. Alex Forest is a minx who can devour a man whom she falls in love with. We get that, yes, but we get just that, almost nothing else expect 80s pure camp. The film, about Alex's erotomaniac relation with Dan, written poorly, acted weakly by Michael Douglas drips with lasciviousness, since the three leads, which includes Dan's goody-two-shoes turned don't-mess-with-my-family wife, Beth, played by Anne Archer. We see heavy kissing, not much clothes, then no clothes, lots of kissing, boobies, kissing then some flimsy schmaltzy drama.The script and direction are executed without much regard for depth, similar to many horror films of the 80s, and I don't want tolerate shallowness. The dialogs are banal and cheesy &#x96; please do not search for 'interpretations', it's silly to construe any. The worst ones are between Douglas and Stuart Pankin at the party scene, or rather all the dialogs between them. It feels like the writer wanted to cut to the chase and therefore paid almost nil attention to provide any characterization for them. When things get messy for Dan, the film's treatment improves momentarily only to reach absurdity towards the end. There is awful scene shifting in 'Ellen is missing' scene and the 'rabbit scene' &#x96; yes, I said it, the rabbit scene was goddamn hilarious with Beth's screams in one shot and then Ellen's screams in the immediate next. Hideously gaudy camera work. The worst is saved for the last &#x96; I feel sorry for Close who tries her best, especially in the end, but is treated so badly and reductively by the director, Adrian Lyne.This is one of the time-capsule movies that should've been discarded by the 90s; it falls in the period somewhere in the 80s where the mystery, suspense, noir, thriller faded and gave way to less interesting jump scene horror like Fatal Attraction.

People expecting a scream-fest will be disappointed at first as it is replete with extended dialogs between the characters. It is more a thriller than a horror, but because the much talked-about 'Shower Scene' that has been ranked in many Scariest Scenes in History lists, those who haven't seen the movie presume that it is a horror movie. The movie ultimately will make you sweat with fear but won't make you scream as if bitten by a Sumatran rat-monkey, and some don't realize this but the filmmaker has succeeded in his attempt to invoke fear in your mind. On my first viewing, even I was quite disillusioned by the movie; it only improved on my subsequent viewings. Curse the Scariest Scenes in History list for creating that presumption. In fact, Oscar Awards create a different presumption about films &#x96; we expect a certain class and when the films, especially those nominated for the Best Picture award, don't stand up to the expectations, we are all the more disappointed. The case here Fatal Attraction.I was quite intrigued by the cover and the plot of the film. Not just that, the 'Oscar' mention raised expectations. A lot could have been explored about this subject, especially about Glenn Close's Alex Forest, because I was astonished to read the cases about Jodie Foster's and David Letterman's stalker and it also put me in wonder about what really happens to these people that they get so deviant. Alex Forest is a minx who can devour a man whom she falls in love with. We get that, yes, but we get just that, almost nothing else expect 80s pure camp. The film, about Alex's erotomaniac relation with Dan, written poorly, acted weakly by Michael Douglas drips with lasciviousness, since the three leads, which includes Dan's goody-two-shoes turned don't-mess-with-my-family wife, Beth, played by Anne Archer. We see heavy kissing, not much clothes, then no clothes, lots of kissing, boobies, kissing then some flimsy schmaltzy drama.The script and direction are executed without much regard for depth, similar to many horror films of the 80s, and I don't want tolerate shallowness. The dialogs are banal and cheesy &#x96; please do not search for 'interpretations', it's silly to construe any. The worst ones are between Douglas and Stuart Pankin at the party scene, or rather all the dialogs between them. It feels like the writer wanted to cut to the chase and therefore paid almost nil attention to provide any characterization for them. When things get messy for Dan, the film's treatment improves momentarily only to reach absurdity towards the end. There is awful scene shifting in 'Ellen is missing' scene and the 'rabbit scene' &#x96; yes, I said it, the rabbit scene was goddamn hilarious with Beth's screams in one shot and then Ellen's screams in the immediate next. Hideously gaudy camera work.

It's about a hustler named Lenny (Ralph Fiennes) who sells dreams (so to speak). You put on a device that covers the top of your head, insert a disc and it plays an experience that someone else had...but you see it through their eyes and hear it too. It's like a drug...very addictive. Then a friend of his is brutally murdered for a disc that has incriminating evidence against the LAPD that could lead to a war. Soon Lenny and ex-girlfriend Lornette (Angela Bassett) are running for their lives from people who will kill them for the disc.The plot is kind of hard to describe but the movie is fascinating. I first saw it up a theatre in stereo on a large screen and it blew me away. The imagery is incredible (excellent direction by Kathryn Bigelow) and the sound mix inventive. The movie isn't easy to watch at times--there's a VERY graphic sequence where a woman is tortured, raped and murdered--but it is needed for the plot. The plot is involved but I was never confused. The acting is, for the most part, great. Fiennes is great and Bassett is just incredible. They're both great actors and give their all to this. Tom Sizemore has a small role and he's pretty good. However Juliette Lewis is terrible as an ex of Lenny. Very wooden. The only real bad thing is the climax--it goes on for far too long (this movie doesn't have to run 145 minutes).

I would love to have been around first hand to see the reaction to Gloria Grahame getting a scalding hot pot of coffee in the mush by a 'Stone' cold Lee Marvin when this first came out. The kind of violence on display in The Big Heat has nothing on modern day cinema, but one's reaction has a lot to do with the way it's done off-screen using the power of suggestion. Detective Bannion's (Glenn Ford) wife dies in a bomb blast, Vince Stone almost breaks a girl's arm at a nightclub, Grahame's character returns the favor to Stone in the closing minutes of the story. The threat of harm isn't so over the top to be unbelievable, but imagining it done to yourself sends a shudder up your spine.I'm not so sure if Glenn Ford was the best choice to portray the good cop going rogue here. I'm thinking of someone like Robert Mitchum with a natural intensity for this kind of role, one suited for an understated malice under the veneer of respectability. Picture him with his hands around Bertha Duncan's (Jeanette Nolan) neck and you'll see what I mean. Ford gets the job done well enough I guess, but even when he was blowing his top it looked like he was just a little too much in control.Not to get sidetracked, but it's always cool when a dated picture like this offers up some reminder of the way things were back in the day.

You've got your women of questionable virtue, nasty villains, good cops\/bad cops and violence and danger lurking around every corner.

I've always known everything that Mr. Plinkett says, but there was never anyone who figured it out like he had.When it comes down to it, they were MAKING SETS even before George Lucas had any story at all. It is like Lucas wanted to AD LIB these films. I realise that he wanted to tell the tale of how Ralph Nadir Skywalker became Darth Vader, but in doing so, he did EVERYTHING the movie companies wanted to do to him when he made Star Wars. Everything Wrong that is.So, where Episode IV or, as I call it, Star Wars was a stroke of genius directing, writing, storytelling - Art that came from ADVERSITY... Episode I was the movie that Star Wars would have been had the studios gotten their way in 1977.Now, unless you are less than 3 years old, this movie is NOT for you. If you like lots and lots of space ships, explosions, robots, gadgets, aliens, all saying nothing and doing nothing, then go for it.If you watch the original - UN-SPECIAL-EDITIONED Star Wars, there are NO scenes where people are sitting on couches talking about their problems, being filmed from only 2 cameras.Literally, these films go from BORING to TOO BUSY within seconds.I admit, I needed help from Harry Plinkett to understand what a travesty these moovies are If you don't believe me, go to RedLetterMedia and check it out!As much as I rate Star Wars Epidose I a 1, I rate Mr. Plinkett's Review a 10. It took lot of guts to put Lucas on the Chopping Block.Lucas needs to get back, somehow to his roots. He EATS too much. That's his problem, let him trade places with me, for a year And then I'll guarantee you he can make a movie of quality.Like he used to be able to do American Graffitti and even his student film, THX-1138. They are not super high quality social statements like Cronenburg's A History of Violence, but they are good, pleasing, interesting moovies. But then Lucas made Star Wars on almost NO money.If Episode I had been limited to a budget of say, 25 Milion bucks. The QUALITY may have been as good as his first SW moovie.But instead, instead of solving problems caused by too much Hi Tech CGI crap, he kept shoving more and more munny into making scene after scene of nonsensical, non-interesting Kack.Well... Lucas made Three Original SW Moovies that I loved. hey that's good for a lifetime of work, he don't need to DO any more.George Luke-A$$ Please STOP Making Moovies!
