The whodunit aspect of the movie is beside the point, and I didn't really care who the killer was, or indeed if the killer was ever even caught.What matters here, of course, is watching the chemistry between Powell and Loy, which practically melts the television screen. William Powell was a sort of Clark Gable with an edge. He looked remarkably like Gable, and he also had that droll way of delivering a line, but he wasn't as much of an everyman as Gable. Myrna Loy is absolutely adorable, one of my favorite actresses from this time period, even though I'm still convinced she was never really used to her full potential. Her appearance in this is as close as any film maker ever came to taking full advantage of her sex appeal, cuteness and comedic flair, but even at that she too often takes a back seat to Powell.And of course special mention must be made of Asta, giving one of the best performances ever delivered by a canine in a motion picture.The later films in the Thin Man series weren't ever able to recapture the magic of this first installment, but that would be a difficult feat for any movie.Grade A+ ","genre":null},{"date":"23 November 2005","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Watch out Fred and Ginger, Hepburn and Tracy, Bonnie and Clyde, because Nick and Nora (or should I say Powell and Loy) are hot on your tails as all-time great screen couple.The Thin Man was the first film to team up William Powell and Myrna Loy as famed sleuthing team, not to mention husband and wife, Nick and Nora Charles.

My timing this year is appropriately planned, the Peter Jackson remake is just a few weeks away. Generally, it's almost impossible to surpass the original of any title, but I'll keep an open mind. In the mean time, I'm still in awe of the cinematography, effects and story line of this 1933 classic.Right from the opening line - Say, is this the moving picture ship? - you know something special is about to happen. Promoter Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) is embarking on a fantastic voyage, and as the viewer tags along, all concerned are about to undergo a harrowing and exciting adventure. His discovery, Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) exudes a likable shyness along with her understated good looks, and if she has any reservations about Denham's offer to star in his movie, it's quickly replaced by the action, adventure and romance on the voyage to the mythical Skull Island. It's not on any of the navigation charts, but it's the perfect destination for Denham's recklessness and secrecy. Did you ever hear of...Kong? Considering that the film was made over seventy years ago, I'm constantly amazed at the technical wizardry and attention to detail employed for what could have been just another monster movie. And make no mistake, this is the quintessential monster film. Once Kong makes his grand entrance to abduct the golden woman, a host of prehistoric beasts appear in rapid succession in grand stop motion photography. We're treated to a stegosaurus, brontosaurus, tyrannosaurus rex, a huge snake like lizard, and a pterodactyl, all supplying varying degrees of menace to Kong and humans alike. What's fascinating though, is the intricacy of the scenes, the predatory wagging of the T-Rex tail as he does battle with Kong, the flow of blood from the dead beast's head, the appearance of the scavenging prehistoric vulture feasting on the body. And it's not just the visual, the sound of the cracking jaw when King Kong defeats his enemy is raw and guttural, complementing a truly visceral confrontation.Kong's brief brush with the island natives after forcing his way through the wooden barricade is also remarkable for it's brutality. More than once, Kong is shown chomping on unlucky victims, while others are shown summarily trampled underfoot in the soft island mud. It's a fitting preview for the destruction in New York, where Kong's new enemies are photographers, trains and aerial dive bombers. Who can forget the pathos in the creature's face as he nurses his gunshot wounds, about to fall to his death from the Empire State Building? The movie ends as it began, paying homage to an ancient Arabian proverb - It was beauty killed the beast.If you pay close attention, you'll be able to pick out the differences between the full body Kong and the separately constructed head and face used for close up shots. The full size Kong, an eighteen inch puppet, has a head that tapers more or less to an upward point, with a ridge line above the eyes. The close-up Kong's face is rounder and squatter, with those unmistakable canines ready to do business.King Kong would go on to create an entire genre of big ape movies, including it's own spin off, The Son of Kong, also featuring Robert Armstrong reprising his Denham character. Quite a few years later, Armstrong appeared in Mighty Joe Young, whose title character was a much more normal sized gorilla. The 1940's and 50's were ripe with B grade fare dealing with gorilla and ape themes, but by then it was usually a man in a monkey suit doing the honors.

He's most notable for being able to evoke subtly comedic discussions amongst his leading characters, save the rare occasion when his strained efforts backfire (Toys comes to mind). Rain Man (1988) is his crowning effort, his best achievement I can think of off-hand. It's considered a drama but it's also a true odd couple comedy, about two opposites who learn they have one common bond their kinship.The Cruise plays Charlie Babbitt, a wealthy car dealer living the high life in California. He's just gotten in a shipment of Ferraris and he's going to make a killing on an upcoming deal for all of them, when his entire background comes back to haunt him in a single unfortunate moment during his newly acquired and quite happy life.Charlie's father has just died, leaving him an old sports car and rose bushes. But more painful than the fact that his father has died or that he was left simply with a car and some prize-winning rosebushes is the fact that Charlie had tried to put his ill-fated past behind him, and now it has caught up with him again. He has to face the reality of his father once again.This isn't really evident the first time you watch the movie. Charlie is angered at the fact that he got nothing more than some bushes and a vehicle, sure, but he admits he expected nothing more. What really angers him is that he has to face his father, dead or alive, once more; either through faded memories or by the realization that he is now dead and their friendship was never repaired.When Charlie finds out that his father's entire estate has been left to a single trustee, he schemes around and unmasks who the trustee really is -- his older brother he never knew he had, Raymond Babbitt (Hoffman), who lives in a homey mental institute and quotes the Bud Abbott and Lou Costello Who's on first? charade when he gets nervous.Charlie confronts his brother, who seems as though he doesn't recognize him. And in a moment of weakness, Charlie kidnaps his brother from his home, drives him back to California, and attempts to squeeze the money out of Raymond, who has no holding on the concept of money at all.Despite his lack of understanding regarding monetary value, Raymond is an idiot savant, and Charlie takes advantage of Raymond's mathematical skills by taking him to Las Vegas to count cards. After achieving a fortune they are thrown out of the casinos and left to face charges of kidnapping. The problem is, by the time it's all over, Charlie has formed an odd sort of bond with his brother. Long after the laughs settle the emotional impact of the story sinks in.The ending is the sort of rare conclusion that brings tears to the eyes. Throughout the film, Charlie is an arrogant, ignorant, greedy businessman who cares of no one but himself. By the end, however, he has learned more than he has in his entire lifetime from the brother he never had. And unlike a lot of the buddy films out there, we get to see the bonding between Charlie and his big brother, Raymond, form on a daily basis, until it is brought to a standstill.Dustin Hoffman gives his best performance in Rain Man, one of such unmatched strength and brilliance that we often feel that we are really watching an autistic man on screen. Raymond Babbitt is one of the most memorable characters you will ever encounter as a viewer, and though Dustin Hoffman isn't necessarily a favorite actor of mine, I place his performance in Rain Man as one of the most convincing and touching performances of all time.Trying to put the reason that Rain Man is so great into words is simply impossible. It's got everything. And as humorous as Raymond Babbitt becomes, he never seems unreal or obnoxious. As I watch him every time I watch the movie, I completely forget Dustin Hoffman is playing him until I mentally remark on how well he is doing so. This is movie magic, folks.Hollywood has a fascination with characters like Forrest Gump and Raymond Babbitt, but -- even more so than Gump -- Raymond is never annoying.

Then you know what I am talking about, but you haven't been then I am sure you want try that out. Watch this movie and then you will know. Pathar Panchali is a very different movie and is not about romance, wealth, beautiful faces, relationships, cars, computers and cellphones. Not about bombs, wars, jails, science, space and fiction or whatever. The movie is the first one in famous Apu Trilogy and is about a poor brahmin family in West Bengal (India). It is an story of a girl in this family, how she grew up among in a poverty stricken family and never had a chance to all things (garland of fake pearls, dolls, candies, bi-scope and hair oil) a girl kid deserves. She grew up a very good girl despite the fact she never went to school. Her brother was born when she was about 5-6 and she loved him a lot. Her plays with her villages girls were very well done. The scenes when one of her friend got married were wonderful and show that how mature she was in her thinking that she is never going to get married was more than a reality. The story captures real moments (hard to describe here!) from a typical poor family in India when (1955) it was not even a decade since India got independence. Poverty was a real issue in India during 1955 and it was Ray's vision to capture it in his movies for generations to see after hundreds of years later what India has come out of today when Bollywood makes $10bn budget movies and they fail to even break-even on box office.Its amazing that Ray had a vision of making such movies when rest of the country was struggling to survive. These movies are really really low cost movies and are example of pure intellectual work. When I was one of the Italian movie La Strada then I thought that perhaps it is the only movie which comes close to Pathar Panchali.I would say all three movies in Apu Trilogy (Pathar Panchali, Aparajito and Apu Sansar) are great jewels in Indian cinema and they will continue to amaze people for hundreds of years.

They originally think that the president left the plane on the escape pod, but they discover near the end of the film that the president stayed on the plane, and used stealth to hide himself in the lower section of the plane, and take out the terrorists one by one!The acting in the film is awesome!

She is also puts in the kind of perfected comedy performance nobody else can. Betty Grable is wonderful, and just as hilarious and beautiful. Lauren Bacall leads the way and is pretty much flawless in her portrayal of the money-hunting ladies ring leader.The cinematography is pure 1950's Hollywood and it looks pretty stunning, it has to be said. This was one of the first movies to use 20th Century Fox's Cinemascope format, which was basically a 1950's version of today's Widescreen technique. This causes the only real problem for me, which is a lack of close-up's. This is something nearly all other Cinemascope pictures fall victim to. The only other possible complaint about the movie is that it's quite slow moving, but then so are nearly all other films from this time so it's perhaps not a very fair criticism.So, all things considered, this is a very entertaining movie and a must see for fans of Monroe, Grable or Bacall. The script, although dated in places, holds up pretty well and even provides a rather poignant take on Sexual Politics in places. The movie was fully restored a couple years back, and this restoration (Completed with a full Widescreen Frame to best emulate the film's original Cinemascope format) is the only way to watch the film.

The movie was fully restored a couple years back, and this restoration (Completed with a full Widescreen Frame to best emulate the film's original Cinemascope format) is the only way to watch the film. How To Marry A Millionaire is a great movie from the 1950's that defines it's era and even manages to remain appealing in some ways today.

He is able to transform the sheer hopelessness of his fate which subjects him to an early death with such outstanding and sincere skills that are deeply moving. Apart from that his entire character - as it is designed - demands substantial acting throughout the whole plot. He delivers a performance that many other actors would simply not have been able to accomplish. It takes a special kind of actor to portray such a character just as Jack here. The message is that despite a fate that destines us to be exposed to tremendous agonies and blank despair, there is always a light of hope, and this light burns in our hearts. It's up to us only what we do with the time that we're granted with. In Jack's case time is even more precious than for normal people. Despite the sadness and despair that is ultimately caused thereby, we still have the chance to make the best out of every minute. All we have to do is value the little things, such as friendship and love, and thus escape the shades of darkness.

Some great acting--and good writing--drive that home. This is what Shall We Dansu should do. Instead, it creates some very serious concerns on the viewer's part, taking you away from the fun that should be the film's bottom line. For example, the wife character and the issue of infidelity are treated seriously enough to leave you talking to the screen What about this, and, What about that?! But the film clearly isn't such a message piece. Also, when certain meeting of the hearts take place, with potentially serious ramifications, there isn't adequate resolution.

The constant movement of the shaky hand-held camera acts as a first person perspective -- we are not merely viewing the movie, but participating in it. This is perhaps as close as we will ever get to realizing the unadulterated fear those soldiers must have felt as they drew nearer to the beaches of France. It is one of the greatest war films ever put on celluloid, its scope arguably larger than any other in the genre, its conflict superb.The movie, based on the actual events surrounding the Nilan brothers during World War II, is about a group of soldiers sent to rescue Private Ryan (Matt Damon), a young man who loses three brothers in the war, and whose mother is spared the possible chance of losing her remaining son after Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) and his platoon are sent on a dangerous mission to find, and return, Private Ryan to safety.The men who fight alongside Miller have to question their own actions. What makes Private Ryan more important than any of them? They all have mothers, too. But they follow orders, venturing into the battlefields of WWII France in search of Private Ryan. The most reluctant of the soldiers is Private Reiben (Edward Burns), a pessimistic everyman who feels no need to risk his own life for that of another man.The battle scenes are ultimately what made Saving Private Ryan one of the highest-grossing films of the decade, and what enticed so many eager viewers into theaters. Many veterans of the war reportedly broke down in tears during one of the first sequences, the landing at Omaha Beach, which probably lasts about fifteen minutes -- at least.However, the movie also reaches a sort of emotional height that few other war films manage to capture. This is a fascinating account of war, packed with terrifyingly realistic scenes and some of the most disturbing images you will ever see in a mainstream film, but it also has a lot to say about friendship and selfless motivations. Earn this, Captain Miller tells Private Ryan at one point in the film.Spielberg has proved countless times that he is capable of abandoning his famously schmaltzy style of film-making to record touching stories that often times relate to his own life. Spielberg claims that he felt an internal desire to tackle this project, as much as he felt it was necessary to direct Schindler's List. Both films work as a sort of documentary-style motion picture, but also contain fundamental emotional truths, which elevate them to higher ground.Tom Hanks, as Captain Miller, is not the first actor who comes to mind when one thinks of war picture, but Hanks' position in the film works (to great effect) primarily because he personifies the everyman quality of a soldier. As we too often forget, the men who fight wars are not always the Schwarzeneggers with huge muscles and a wealth of weapons and ammunition. The soldiers in World War II were fathers, husbands, brothers, sons. Hanks successfully embodies the image of a simple man who is thrust into a world war and tries his best to stay alive.Is Saving Private Ryan a better movie than Apocalypse Now, Platoon, or other great war pictures in the genre? Not necessarily. But it stands on its own as an amazing achievement of pure film-making, and an ode to the thousands of men who lost their lives for the campaign against Hitler's armies. If you can stomach the violence and accurate depictions of brutal warfare, Saving Private Ryan is one of the most moving cinematic experiences you will ever have.

It is one of the greatest war films ever put on celluloid, its scope arguably larger than any other in the genre, its conflict superb.The movie, based on the actual events surrounding the Nilan brothers during World War II, is about a group of soldiers sent to rescue Private Ryan (Matt Damon), a young man who loses three brothers in the war, and whose mother is spared the possible chance of losing her remaining son after Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) and his platoon are sent on a dangerous mission to find, and return, Private Ryan to safety.The men who fight alongside Miller have to question their own actions. What makes Private Ryan more important than any of them? They all have mothers, too. But they follow orders, venturing into the battlefields of WWII France in search of Private Ryan. The most reluctant of the soldiers is Private Reiben (Edward Burns), a pessimistic everyman who feels no need to risk his own life for that of another man.The battle scenes are ultimately what made Saving Private Ryan one of the highest-grossing films of the decade, and what enticed so many eager viewers into theaters. Many veterans of the war reportedly broke down in tears during one of the first sequences, the landing at Omaha Beach, which probably lasts about fifteen minutes -- at least.However, the movie also reaches a sort of emotional height that few other war films manage to capture. This is a fascinating account of war, packed with terrifyingly realistic scenes and some of the most disturbing images you will ever see in a mainstream film, but it also has a lot to say about friendship and selfless motivations. Earn this, Captain Miller tells Private Ryan at one point in the film.Spielberg has proved countless times that he is capable of abandoning his famously schmaltzy style of film-making to record touching stories that often times relate to his own life. Spielberg claims that he felt an internal desire to tackle this project, as much as he felt it was necessary to direct Schindler's List. Both films work as a sort of documentary-style motion picture, but also contain fundamental emotional truths, which elevate them to higher ground.Tom Hanks, as Captain Miller, is not the first actor who comes to mind when one thinks of war picture, but Hanks' position in the film works (to great effect) primarily because he personifies the everyman quality of a soldier. As we too often forget, the men who fight wars are not always the Schwarzeneggers with huge muscles and a wealth of weapons and ammunition. The soldiers in World War II were fathers, husbands, brothers, sons. Hanks successfully embodies the image of a simple man who is thrust into a world war and tries his best to stay alive.Is Saving Private Ryan a better movie than Apocalypse Now, Platoon, or other great war pictures in the genre? Not necessarily. But it stands on its own as an amazing achievement of pure film-making, and an ode to the thousands of men who lost their lives for the campaign against Hitler's armies. If you can stomach the violence and accurate depictions of brutal warfare, Saving Private Ryan is one of the most moving cinematic experiences you will ever have.

I didn't know Will Sasso was in the movie, he is a good comedian. Chance and Sassy were really funny along with Pete and his partner. This movie was better than the first one. I usually don't like Animal movies but this was one of the only ones I ever liked. This is only my opinion, other's may very. I really like this movie because I'm a big comedy fan and this movie basically was a comedy. Not only that, it was a good heroic tale and shows the strength of family. I wish I could have a dog like Chance and Shadow (though I would like for them to actually speak). Check out the movie for yourself. If you don't like, there is nothing I can do about it, but I would recommend it to comedy lovers and drama lovers.
