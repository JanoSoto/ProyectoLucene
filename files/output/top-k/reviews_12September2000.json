I did think about it for a while afterwards and I'm sure that what Paul Anderson wanted. There is the total Altman influence here, but this film is a little darker than Short Cuts and a little more drawn out. In fact, there are so many stories happening, you get the feeling some of the actors were just given parts to have a part (like Julianne Moore, whose part could have been completely cut out and it wouldn't have made a single difference). Tom Cruise, who was definitely good, but amazingly annoying in some parts, got on my nerves. But he delivers the best line of the whole movie (while being interviewed, then clamming up. I won't give it away if you haven't seen it).  The film definitely could have used a little more editting. Just about every actor in the movie has a scene somewhere that is too long and unnecessary.Eight actors who appeared in Anderson's Boogie Nights appear in this film (or at least eight that I counted) and with talent like Hoffman, Baker and Macy, you really can't lose.  There's a reason why Anderson uses them in all his films. But really, far and away the best thing about this film, is John Rielly as the cop. Everything about his performance, every scene he's in, his dialog all superb.  You'll find after a while, you just want to get to his scenes. He's funny and perfectly cast. Just as in Boogie Nights, some of his lines are so dead on and laugh out loud hilarious, he alone is worth seeing the film.  You almost wish the film would have been about his character, seeing as how it was miles more interesting than anyone else in the film. If you've got three hours, check this film out. If you've got even more time, get the DVD and watch the Magnolia Diary showing the behind the scenes progress of the making of the film. And hope and Anderson used John Reilly again.

OK there are not big names in it nor in the cast, nor behind the chair, nor behind the pen, still it succeeds in doing something that I've have seen many films fail in over the years that featured big names. Of course I've seen failures with little names too, but that is not the point I'm trying to make here. The point I'm trying to make here is that how can a piece of sh.t movie like Mission to Mars be almost just as successful as this movie. I do not get it. I mean ,of course I thought, well, &#145;f.ck the reviews' and I went right on and saw Mission to Mars, but I wish I would not have. With this movie it was different, I was not too keen on going, actually I did NOT care if I saw it or not, because basically the Trailer was not too good and that is a pity. If the trailer would have been as good as the one for Mission to Mars (which had to be good, otherwise not so many people would have went to the cinema to watch that crappy movie), this film could have made 2 times the money it actually made at the box office.Another thing that I have to say here, is, that despite all the booing and wooing of the past about teenie \/ high school flicks I must say there certainly are a lot of them these days that are worth seeing. Of course these are not the 10 Things I hate about you flicks, but rather the films involving teens that are &#145;different'. Like Cruel Intentions, Scream, Scream 2 or last year's hit American Pie. There are really a bunch of great movies out there that centre teens and I feel that they are doing it great, for they are not only looking to make the eye enjoy (as in sexy females and maybe gorgeous guy's) but there are stories there too. I mean these stories are not only better than some of the other stories out there, but they are really, definitely far better carried out. I mean two years ago or so, that The Avengers movie Trailer, it rocked, but what was the conclusion after watching it ? The film was carried out poorly. This one is actually a bit different, because the Trailer does not stand out, but the movie itself does, because it was carried out very good.On to the film itself, what was good and what was bad? Well bad there is not much to say there, actually there is nothing to say there. What was good, well let's get onto that in a bit, but first of all, what about the actors? Well they all get their job done and that is what counts, they are all good. No outstanding folks here, nor on the Oscar nor on the Razzie side. While I'm on it, I must say that the film was not too thrilling, meaning you don't sit on the edge of your seat the whole time, but it was still entertaining enough.On to the good stuff, what did I like ? Man that is like a thousand things. I liked the direction very much, for it was very well, not only angles and stuff, particularly in the death scenes, but also in the way of filming. I mean this film had not the biggest budget and yet it's effects are believable and good which is due to a style of direction that admits just the right amount of good effects to be there. Also, of course, a good thing when connected with direction was the editing. It was done at the right times and in good ways. The music was good too, I mean I never heard of the woman doing the music in this film before, but she got her sh.t together man, it was good. Now on to the film in particular, talking favourite scenes. My favourite scenes are the inside view of the exploding plane and deaths 2, 4 and of course 5. These are my favourite scenes, not only because they are carried out well but because they are somehow surprising (which counts only for the death scenes 2, 4 and 5). The surprise element is somehow too, the thing I liked very much in this film. You never knew exactly how someone was gonna die until it actually happened and even when you guessed it somehow was different than the most scenes I've seen in my life (that death scene 4 really surprised me in the way of how (the place) he was killed). Enough about the film and it's makers, what about the story ? It was not only inventive and new, but it also was smart, for it reflects a thought all humans have. Death is destiny and you can't escape death. OK there have been many films involving death or Satan, but few, really few were able to be original and bring to us a new dimension. This one did though and we should be glad it did.The ending of the film is very good, for it leaves questions open plus it leaves the possibility of a second instalment open too, so it is good for both the viewer and the makers. Believe me, I do not like every sequel (although I'm pretty sure they are making a sequel to this one), but I sure like an ending like this one, for it is quick, abrupt and does not answer all the questions. Plus I found the sarcastic song at the credits rather funny too.8 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 September 2000","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  This movie is good people, you understand that.

People have said it was stupid because they didn't have to go inside his mind or they didn't have to do this or that.  After The Cell ended, I was left wondering about my own personal dreamland or what goes on inside everyone else's mental landscape and if we could see what it's like inside.  After the first 5 minutes of The Cell, there was already this feeling of I want more.  I was not disappointed when they gave more.  I left the theater totally satisfied with what I saw and I was touched by the images that were displayed on the wide screen.  The combination of mental images range from gorgeous to grotesque, and the manner with which they are woven together is simply masterful.  Out of Hollywood has come what may be a special-effects art film, a movie that makes us question the mythical landscape of the human psyche.The most intriguing idea of the film is never overdone or incomplete. Honestly, what would it be like to wander about inside the mind of a psychopathic killer?  Some of the visions that were realized are a step beyond what I thought a conscious human being was capable of comprehending. It stuck with me because I can vividly remember dreams I've had over the years that were just like some of the ones in the film, nightmares you can't wake up from, dreams that are too good to be true.

In the age of films that are cliched, redundant, and just plain forgettable, the filmmaking world has been blessed with a genius known as David Lynch.  I watched Lost Highway with an open mind, and the first time I watched it, it(as probably with most viewers)didn't quite understand it.  I was confused, but it stuck with me.  I hadn't seen anything quite like it before.  I watched it again, and again, and again, totalling about nearly 10 times in one rental.  Finally, I figured it out, and then I was scared and amazed by what I saw.  This film excels on many levels.  For one, it's an excellent horror film.  Forget about those pseudo-horror movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer and Friday the 13th.  This is a real scary movie that won't leave you alone(I lost a week of sleep over it)!  Second, it's a masterpiece in how it's woven together and how puzzling it is.  Just so you know, I like films that make you think and ask you to connect the dots.  I'm sick of being spoon-fed all the answers and secrets.  With Lost Highway, you'll always see something new.  I purchased it because I liked it so much, and I discovered even more disturbing secrets buried within it.  This is what makes a film fascinating and unforgettable.  It just won't go away.  You can't just watch it and put it behind you.  I won't spoil anything for those who haven't seen it yet, and it's too complicated to go into the whole plot.  Plus, I'm the kind of person who likes to go to a movie with an open mind because of the element of suprise and mystery.  It's a shame that David Lynch's films aren't given enough interest by the public.

I started watching this movie late one night and didn't want to stop -- so I didn't!The movie concerns a young girl who goes to live with her father after her mother is killed in a car accident. Dad and Mom divorced many years before and live on opposite sides of the world -- Canada and New Zealand -- so she doesn't know Dad very well.Jeff Bridges plays the father in this film and does it incredibly well. He's an artist who is just a little bit quirky, a big believer in following your dreams, and desperately trying to capture the love for his daughter that he regrets having lost in the divorce years before. Anna Paquin as his 13-year old daughter is wonderful -- how do young kids act so well??? -- as she learns to grieve for her mother, find a new life in a new country, and love and trust a father whom she has barely known most of her life.The supporting cast shines as well, in most cases. Most notably is Terry Kinney as Daniels brother and the young girls uncle. He's the kind of uncle everyone wants to have around, although when he falls asleep while babysitting and Paquin's character disappears, he doesn't seem very responsible. He becomes a bit of a scene stealer though as the movie progresses. He has one of the best lines in the film when he tries to convince a U.S. border-patrol agent that he needs dozens of gallons of gas to go camping for his portable generator to run his blender and TV. Nothing like camping in the middle of no where with your VCR, a good movie, and a pina colada.Dana Delany (of TV's China Beach fame) plays Daniels sometimes live-in girlfriend and seems to be the only actor who doesn't really stretch in this part. I don't believe this is Delany's fault, however. This story is primarily about the father-daughter relationship, and Delany's part suffers as a result. Most scenes are supportive and don't really give her a chance to shine.The story is well written with a combination of genuine emotion, without becoming overly sappy. Yes, the film is sweet, but not sickeningly so. When the credits began to roll at the end of this movie, the first thing I thought of way, How could this have gotten a PG rating? I *literally* heard one four-letter word in the entire film, and that is said under the breath so that I wasn't even sure I heard it. There is one reference to sex outside marriage, and a car accident at the beginning of the film. That's it. Parents, you can show this to young children without any real concern.

Who´s cutter? Who´s smarter? Who gets more audience on his side? Well, see it!The story is quite the typical American thriller a pivotal character (Wood´s) with a personal loss (in this case recent) who confronts a temporary change in his \/ her life, in this case, living for a while with some relatives.Fine up to there, and, may I mention that someday I´m going to visit the house that appears on the film. It´s really beautiful. Not only that, the score by Elmer Bernstein is one the best of his career (quite a career), with a really good opening theme, not to mention the music composed for the frozen lake scene.What happens next is an unrealistic succession of events. They all are packed in a really small amount of time. You have to consider then, that Wood´s character, acts as a catalyst, affecting the behavior of the antagonist, which is Culkin´s character.What I´ve noticed is that people tend to like this movie, except for the final scene. There´s where the trouble may be, but, consider the options. Once you have seen it, what other ending would you allow, or prefer the movie to have? Really, think about it; I do believe the director made a smart choice; unrealistic, out-of-the-sleeve-kind-of-scene, and only-found-in-movies, but smart choice.So, take a peek, watch it, and agree with me. I´m sure you will.P.S. Would anyone happen to know where the movie´s house may be located? I´ve tried to find out, but up to now no such luck. Feel totally free to send me a message. I´ll really appreciate it. After all, I´ll need to know where it is if I want to visit it someday.

So we stayed with our hands covering our faces (ok, we made tiny peepholes - we were captivated).I personally did not relax until the climatic kick-butt scene with a roaring, T-Rex NEAR THE END of the movie.  I could almost feel my hair being blown back. It was then I realized I hadn't exhaled in well over an hour and a half.  It was time to pry my fingers from the arm-rests.  Walking out of there, I felt completely shell-shocked; an experience I will not soon forget.  Wotta ride!

Could a 'sexist, misogynistic dinosaur' (as M describes him) survive in the politically correct Nineties?          The answer was yes and the movie proved to be one of the most lucrative in the series, grossing over           $350million worldwide. Combine that with the earnings from Brosnan's other two Bond outings,           Tomorrow Never Dies and The World is Not Enough, and those three films have made over $1billion.          Not bad for an ageing British agent who has been tackling nefarious villains on the big screen since 1962.          Unlike the last two 007 movies which ranged from the patchy to the yawnsome, GoldenEye is a tense,           rollercoaster ride from the word go.          Directed by Martin Campbell, who gave the world Edge of Darkness - one of the greatest dramas ever to           grace the small screen - it pitches Bond against old colleague 006 (Sean Bean).          Boasting some fantastic sets by series veteran Peter Lamont, great special effects by Derek Meddings - in           the final movie before his untimely death, and an atmospheric, offbeat score by Leon's Eric Serra, this is           priceless entertainment.           However, a word of advice Turn the sound off at the end credits as Serra's closing love theme almost           wrecks a perfect movie. The French composer is a genius when it comes to writing soundtracks for           blockbusters like The Fifth Element, but does insist on lending his vocal talents to the project. Not a wise           move.          Now back to the story.          James Bond is called into action when the eponymous device goes missing; a weapon capable of           projecting an electro magnetic pulse at any target. Once computers are disabled by the blast, 006 and his           cohorts wipe out all credit cards and reduce Blighty to the stone age.          Or something.          He's soon involved with a kingpin of the Russian Mafia (Robbie Coltrane), a gorgeous computer           programmer (Isabella Scorupco) and an egotistical hacker (Alan Cumming).          Old favourite Q (the late Desmond Llewellyn) is on hand along with a new M (Judi Dench) and           Moneypenny (Samntha Bond).          The plot may be nothing new, but it scarcely matters.          The dialogue is witty, the action scenes nail-biting and as the suave spy, nobody does it better than Pierce           Brosnan in a role he was born to play.          Now pay attention, because here are some trivia points to wow your family and friends.          The Ferrari featured in the opening chase was actually rented and after it collided with Bond's Aston           Martin had to be repaired over night at a cost of $80,000.          Worth remembering the next time you get a dent in the old motor.          When 007 arrives at the Casino in Monte Carlo, the first few scenes are shot on location and then it cuts to           a perfect replica reproduced in London. Take a bow Peter Lamont and his crew of technicians as the join is           impossible to spot.          Taking the crown as queen of all Bond villains is X-Men's Famke Janssen as the deliciously evil Xenia           Onatopp. She loves nothing more than crushing men to death with her thighs and wiping out control           rooms with her trusty machine gun.          The fight between her and Bond in a sauna ranks among the best ever scene on film.          From the stunning pre-credits scene in which Bond bungee jumps off a dam to the explosive finale on a           satellite dish, GoldenEye is more than your average 007 adventure.          This is the Rolls Royce of action movies which has lost little of its lustre in the five years since its release.           The tank chase through St Petersburgh is a masterpiece - despite the obvious product placement for a           brand of mineral water - while cast and crew pull out all the stops to make this a premium Bond.
