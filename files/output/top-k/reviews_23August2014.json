The film was from 2001 and in those days I was 7, so it was one of the first movie's I saw in cinema. If you are the young you can't remember anything so a movie must make a very good impression on you. If it wants to be good. There was one scene in this first movie that I will never forget. It made such a big impression on me. It was were my love for Harry Potter started. Hogwarts was in a way a safe place for me, and the magic really hit me. And it still does today. This scene that impressed me so much was when the audience could see Hogwarts for the very first time on screen. You just saw this massive castle, in that was so impressive; I actually can't put it into world how enthusiastic I was. The children were sitting in the boats effortlessly and were floating over the water. The castle had something magical and I was sure I would never forget it.I think this shows that Chris Columbus was a very great Director. He really brought the magic over on screen. I still think Chris Columbus was the best choice to make the first two films. His ambition and his effort were incredible. I have a lot of respect for this man on the way I made this film. And at times it wasn't easy. The biggest part of the casting were children of the age of 11 years old. And he always needed to be calm, never he lost his temper or his patience. He kept holding on to his job. And most important he really wanted it to be good, so if Rowling had any critics he really wanted to change it. Those reasons are for me the reason why he was the best man to do the first two films. I had loved to see him doing the whole series.But more about that in my review on Film 3 prisoner of Azkaban. People sometimes forget that when they start making these movies they had to start everything. How does it sound when someone waves his wand ? How does the Hogwarts uniform look like ? How does wands look ? Etc. There were so much questions that needed to be answered, I think Chris dealt with that on an incredible way. He is certainly one of my Childhood heroes.The pressure of the filmmakers was so big especially because of the casting of the characters and the look of the magical world; Hogwarts, Diagon Alley. The fans had certain wishes they really cared about the books and wanted it to be perfect. The filmmakers must have felt this pressure I am almost 100 % sure of that. So David Heyman (producer) and Chris Columbus had to cast the characters and as a fan I couldn't wish for a better casting. I most enjoyed Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore. He did such an impressive job and it is so sad that he died. He was perfect for the role.That's the same for Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger , Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter. Actually I can go on and say it about the whole casting, because they were perfect. We, fans, had the best cast, the best directors, producers we could wish for in a franchise. And I really can't be more proud than I am now it is over. On the first film those actors did such an amazing job. And David Heyman and Chris Columbus did such an amazing job for the casting.The storyline is something really important in a film. And I am just not very fond of Steve Kloves. In the first film he surprisingly did a good job and that's why, combined with casting , the first film is one of the best in the series. Sometimes you need to leave your favorite parts of the book and make selection to include only the most important. Steve Kloves did a very good job in the first movie but had of course help of J.K.Rowling. The thing I was a little disappointed about was that some lines that were meant for Ron were said by Hermione. This was because Steve liked the character Hermione. And I think that isn't necessarily at all. Because things characters say can develop characters, or show how characters are. It is very clear that the first movie is a very mysterious film you didn't get the answer immediately. For example when Harry looks at Snape for the first time. On the other hand there is a very good character development not only through the whole series but also in the first movie. Something that belonged in the story was how Prof.Quirrell got in touch with Voldemort ? I mean this is the most important question in the first film and is explained very good in the book. But you didn't hear Voldemort or Quirrell talk about how this happened. How did Voldemort get inside his head ? I rate this film 10\/10 just because; as a fan I couldn't wish for a better start of the film series based on those books. I think the movies should never be remade, because Filmmakers will have the right, then to do whatever they want. To change certain things. A lot of remakes went wrong because filmmakers didn't respect the original source of the story. We should respect the effort the directors, the actors and everyone who worked on Harry Potter throughout the series had in this films. I absolutely Believe this story's; the books and this films are Timeless. People of all generations can grow up with this. Although not the same as the original generation. They can grow up with Harry, and watch these films. It was absolutely unforgettable.

Having now watched it I can say that it does, in fact, stink.The first story, written and directed by Allison Anders, is a slight but amusing story about a coven of witches trying to perform a spell to resurrect a goddess. Each witch is responsible for bringing a certain ingredient for the spell but one witch (Ione Skye) was unable to get hers so she has one hour to get the ingredient so they can do the spell. I won't spoil what the ingredient is. You'll either laugh at it or find it childish and stupid. I chuckled so I guess I'm in the middle on the maturity scale. This was the best segment in the movie, although it ends abruptly.The second story, written and directed by Alexandre Rockwell, has Ted the bellhop delivering ice to the wrong room and being accused by the husband of having an affair with his wife (Jennifer Beals). There was something very familiar about this plot, although I can't seem to remember where I've seen it before. Anyway, it's not funny in the slightest. This is the worst of the four stories. The third story, from Robert Rodriguez, has the bellhop being paid to babysit Antonio Banderas' kids. He leaves them in the room alone with and they predictably get up to mischief. This segment isn't very funny either. It's like a more adult version of the kind of humor Rodriguez used in the Spy Kids movies.Quentin Tarantino writes, directs, and acts in the last story and this is probably why most people even watched this. Being a Tarantino fan, I was cautious about it because I've often heard this called his worst work. Quentin plays a movie director who places a bet with a friend. If the friend wins, he gets Quentin's car. If he loses, Ted the bellhop has to cut off his pinky finger. Pretty flimsy stuff. Very dialogue-heavy as you would expect from Tarantino, although nothing memorable. Quentin's acting is atrocious in this. To be fair, even a better actor wouldn't have made the crappy script work. Bruce Willis appears in this segment for free, resulting in a SAG dispute which is why he's not listed in the credits. This segment also features a ridiculous amount of F words, even for Tarantino.Overall, it's not a funny movie. Roth is very weak. He's obviously trying to be over-the-top with his comedy, like some kind of foul-mouthed Jerry Lewis. He just got on my nerves in every segment. He pulls out all of the cornball stops rubberfacing, silly voices, slapstick, and everybody's favorite last resort F bombs every other word. I didn't find him the least bit funny.

All I knew going in was that Roller Ball is a violent game controlled by the government that is used as a means of exercising control over society, and it's technically true, but that's all there is, and it's barely there at all. Despite watching three matches and a practice, no rules are laid out at all. We know a ball goes into a goal to score a point, and the game consists of three twenty-minute periods, and there are motorcycles on the track, but otherwise, we know nothing. Penalties are disallowed for the final two games, but we don't know what constitutes a penalty. Death is established as a risk in normal games, so where is the line drawn for penalties? In the last game, there's no time limit, yet the clock is still counting down. Are they literally just playing to the last man? Is that the only criterion for ending the game? No one seems interested in scoring, just slaughter, yet at one point New York's coach screams at Houston for their brutality. We do get a few speeches about how society has changed and corporations are in control, but we never really see society. We only see Jonathan E. and his friends. He moans about being controlled, but the only sign of control is that the Energy corporation is firmly suggesting that he retire after 10 years as a star player. He thinks they stole his wife, but then we find out that she left on her own, so we have no proof that the corporation is evil except that evil music plays when we see the executives and they make evil facial expressions. At one point, one of the executives spells out that Roller Ball is used to demonstrate that individual effort is fruitless, one man cannot succeed alone, and therefore one man cannot challenge the system and win. Jonathan E. is a threat because he's been successful for 10 years and he's surpassing his team in glory. The only symptom we see of this is that the fans chant his name instead of his team. There's no subversion. There's no discontent. We never see him as the face of a rebellion. There's never any indication that anyone in society is even thinking of rebelling, regardless of what Jonathan E. does. And yet, despite being evil and threatened by Jonathan E., the corporation does nothing but politely insist that he retire and vaguely threaten him. When he time and again refuses, the executive just looks angry and acts as if his hands are tied. Removing the time limit seems to be the only card they have to play. They do say they don't want to kill him, for some unspecified reason, but that doesn't mean they have no other options. There are people he cares about his ex-wife, his friend Moon Pie (yes, that's his name), his old trainer. They're expendable. Even when Moon Pie is injured, it isn't because of anything the corporation did, and they don't then tell Jonathan E. You'll be next. It seems more incidental than anything. There are good concepts in there- a corrupt government exercising control over its people through forced participation in a blood sport where death or glory are the only options, and even if you survive you're still their pawn for the rest of your life- but they weren't put to anything resembling good use in this movie. Suzanne Collins handled it better in The Hunger Games. Even as much as I disliked that series, it left me asking serious questions, not What is in those magic future drug mints? or Why haven't they just killed this guy already?

Penalties are disallowed for the final two games, but we don't know what constitutes a penalty. Death is established as a risk in normal games, so where is the line drawn for penalties? In the last game, there's no time limit, yet the clock is still counting down. Are they literally just playing to the last man? Is that the only criterion for ending the game? No one seems interested in scoring, just slaughter, yet at one point New York's coach screams at Houston for their brutality. We do get a few speeches about how society has changed and corporations are in control, but we never really see society. We only see Jonathan E. and his friends. He moans about being controlled, but the only sign of control is that the Energy corporation is firmly suggesting that he retire after 10 years as a star player. He thinks they stole his wife, but then we find out that she left on her own, so we have no proof that the corporation is evil except that evil music plays when we see the executives and they make evil facial expressions. At one point, one of the executives spells out that Roller Ball is used to demonstrate that individual effort is fruitless, one man cannot succeed alone, and therefore one man cannot challenge the system and win. Jonathan E. is a threat because he's been successful for 10 years and he's surpassing his team in glory. The only symptom we see of this is that the fans chant his name instead of his team. There's no subversion. There's no discontent. We never see him as the face of a rebellion. There's never any indication that anyone in society is even thinking of rebelling, regardless of what Jonathan E. does. And yet, despite being evil and threatened by Jonathan E., the corporation does nothing but politely insist that he retire and vaguely threaten him. When he time and again refuses, the executive just looks angry and acts as if his hands are tied. Removing the time limit seems to be the only card they have to play. They do say they don't want to kill him, for some unspecified reason, but that doesn't mean they have no other options. There are people he cares about his ex-wife, his friend Moon Pie (yes, that's his name), his old trainer. They're expendable. Even when Moon Pie is injured, it isn't because of anything the corporation did, and they don't then tell Jonathan E. You'll be next. It seems more incidental than anything. There are good concepts in there- a corrupt government exercising control over its people through forced participation in a blood sport where death or glory are the only options, and even if you survive you're still their pawn for the rest of your life- but they weren't put to anything resembling good use in this movie. Suzanne Collins handled it better in The Hunger Games. Even as much as I disliked that series, it left me asking serious questions, not What is in those magic future drug mints? or Why haven't they just killed this guy already?

Alyosha Skvortsov (Volodya Ivashov) tries to make it home during a leave, after being rewarded for taking out two German tanks. On the way, he meets several people and help them deal with the stress of war time life. But with each random act of kindness, spells less time for him to reach his love ones before he has to go back to his life as a soldier on the war front. This Soviet love road movie came out, and really surprised the world! It even surprising got an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay in the US, where most people show them as just the enemy. The film paint a very positive light of the red army without going over patriotic. It didn't felt like a propaganda film. It shows, a realistic tone to the war with the amount of loses that Russia was taken. The film show a subversive or critical tone to lose. Things like this, would be banned or censored under Stalinism. It illuminates how war can ravish both an individual and a country. Coming off, from the death of totalitarian Joseph Stalin, a few years earlier in 1953. Soviet movies makers can now have a little bit freedom, as the regime became more, reformed. It did help that the Soviet leader, at the time, Nikita Khrushchev was a fan of the director, so Chukrai was given more flexibility than normal. It really shows here with how the soldiers were portray. The movie is about the incredible ability of humans to adapt to the most extreme conditions on survival instinct, love and courage. The film is beautiful well-shot. Just watching it, you can see the how much work was put into this film from the wide shots of farmland to the harsh reality of the battlefield. Beautiful cinematography for a black & white film. Another great thing about the movie is the music by Mikhail Ziv. You be clutching at your heart-strings for it. Another thing, great about the movie is the pacing. For a movie that's 88 minutes long. They really put a lot of things into it that are pretty well-delivery stories. The movie didn't need a lot of dialogue, as the movie show more than it told. The movie had such a convincing and humane performance from both Vladimir Ivashov and Zhanna Prokhorenko, as his love-interest Shura. They make a beautiful couple. They had amazing chemistry. Zhanna was stunning, she had the face of an angel. Her character had a lot of depth. Even supporting actors help show the stress, love has to go through like the ex-soldier, Vasya (Evgeniy Urbanskiy) sub-plot of being a burden to his wife due to him, losing a leg. Another great scene is when Alyosha visit a fellow soldier's wife (Valentina Markova), only to find out that she was cheating on him. Really heart-breaking. The whole film is very touching. The movie faults could be that it's pretty predictable and somewhat depressing. After all, the movie opening really set the tone of the film, by stating out what happen to Alyosha during the war. I didn't felt the narrative prologue was needed in the beginning, since they repeat it in the end, as well. It really makes you wonder, why am I'm watching this film, if something really bad is going to happen him in the end. It kinda guilt-trip you into an emotional trap. The warmth is missing in the overdubbed voices, in the dubbed version of the film. If you find a copy, watch the movie in Russian, with English sub-titles.

Unfortunately that happens less and less so most of the time if I want to see a good horror I have to bust out my DVD collection. One of these older classics is House. Back in its day it was one of the VHS era's big films, it's out on DVD too but it didn't sell as well. It's a hidden cult horror. It doesn't have the following of say Evil Dead, but people who like the genre probably know about it. The film was made by Steve Miner, Sean S. Cunningham and Roger Corman. The first two names should be familiar to Friday the 13th fans, as Cunningham directed the 1st part and was the producer on the 2nd making a carrier out of the House and Friday franchises. Oh he did direct Deep Star Six that was a tribute to The Abyss, more or less successfully. Miner directed the 2nd and 3rd part of Friday, so we have him to thank for Jason's hockey mask, but he's also responsible for a heap of successful horror flicks like Lake Placid, Warlock, Halloween H20 20 Years Later. So if really can be said that House was made by professionals and that's why it's one of the 80s classic horror flicks. The story Roger Cobb is a Vietnam vet whose career as a horror novelist has taken a turn for the worse when his son Jimmy mysteriously disappears while visiting his aunt's house. Roger's search for Jimmy destroys his marriage and his writing career. The sudden death of his aunt brings Roger back to the house where his nightmares began. The evil zombies in the house force Roger to endure a harrowing journey into his past. The film's big value is the undeniable 80s vibe. It's great to see monsters made for real and not out of CGI. The technical parts are cutely lame, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just a part of that era of film making. The story is a little cliché, the terror in the huge house wasn't a new concept even back then. Plus even the start credits remind me of The Haunting. The directors work shows all his experience in the horror film genre, so despite the cliché of the basic story House isn't just a typical scary, ghost house story, but is closer to Sam Raimi's Evid Dead. The screaming of demonic beings, the Chaplin- esc situational comedy and the seemingly hopeless ministrations of the lonely hero all prove this. The actors work well within what we expect from the genre, but don't expect anything outstanding with the characters. William Katt was okay, but he doesn't come close to Ash's (Bruce Campbell's character in Evil Dead) genius. Mac Ahlberg the cinematographer though worked almost perfectly. His experience in horror films (Dolly, Re-Animator) showed here too. I have to also mention, that the monsters in House and the effects were outstanding, but that's not surprising considering the experience of the effects guys with films like Back to the Future 2 and The Fly. The film is a perfect example of what comes about when professionals get together to make a film in their favorite genre. When I first saw this film I didn't really know what to make of it. It was filled with humor, monsters, drama&#x85; it seemed like a cocktail of genres&#x85; watching it again now it lost this effect, so the films biggest problem is that if someone isn't watching it out of nostalgia they'll probably be quite disappointed.

To the jaded modern eye the film may appear quite ordinary. But it was a marvel of its time, a massive achievement, a film which changed films forever. And dated though it may be it still has the capacity to entertain all these years later. Yes, the dialogue may be hokey. The acting may be hammy. And the visual effects, so revolutionary for their time, seem laughably primitive in this age of computerized effects wizardry. But the film still works. It has old-school charm, a simple story which grabs you and a truly legendary monster. Better effects don't necessarily make for a better movie as Michael Bay proves on a regular basis. You need a story, you need that hook, you need something actually worth caring about. This movie has those things. And that is why King Kong still fascinates us today.The very simple, but engaging, story follows Carl Denham, a filmmaker who leads a party sailing from New York to film...something. Somewhere. He won't tell anyone where they're going or why. This secrecy understandably makes it difficult to secure a leading lady for his film. Denham plucks young, beautiful Ann Darrow off the street. Starving, unemployed, with nothing to lose Ann agrees to go off on this mysterious voyage. Her presence aboard the ship annoys first mate Jack Driscoll who believes a ship is no place for a dame. But Jack inevitably falls in love with her, maybe because she's beautiful, probably because the plot requires him to. There needs to be a hero to rush in and save Ann when she's a damsel in distress. And boy will there ever be distress.So after much stilted dialogue and, from Robert Armstrong playing Denham in particular, some seriously hammy acting the voyage reaches its destination. It's a mysterious island somewhere around Indonesia inhabited by a small tribe of primitive natives. But Denham's not here for them. He's here for the island's other inhabitant. Kong. The giant, prehistoric ape is no mythical creature. He's all too real as Ann will find out when she manages to get herself captured by the natives and offered up as a gift to the great beast. But a funny thing happens. The beast loves the beauty. And will do anything to protect her. And protect her he must because Kong is not the only giant, prehistoric creature on this island. Kong battles one giant monster after another. All the while Driscoll is racing through the jungle trying to reach and rescue the woman he loves. After some more monster battles and a Kong rampage through the poor native village we find ourselves back in New York. Yes, rather sudden and jarring it is. Snap your fingers and Kong is on Broadway, setting up one of the most famous endings in film history.There are certainly things you can quibble with in King Kong. The dialogue, even allowing for the time the film was made, is impossibly corny. Armstrong's hamming it up grows tiresome very quickly. And there is the sense that once we meet Kong the story somewhat gets lost. From there it's all about visual effects, the monsters take over the movie. When Kong battles the T-Rex it's thrilling. But then he has to battle another monster. And another one. And it gets rather repetitive. The effects team did such a great job bringing Kong to life I suppose you can't blame the filmmakers for wanting to show off a bit. But as Kong rampages throughout the last half of the film you can't help but think maybe the humans in this story could've had a little more to do. Fay Wray more than earns her scream queen designation here as she plays Ann. But she probably was capable of doing more than looking pretty and screaming her lungs out. Maybe the love affair between Ann and Driscoll could have been explored further, maybe during the long journey back to New York which we never got to see. But of course Kong was always going to be the star of this movie. They don't call him King for no reason. And he is quite the movie monster. But a monster with heart. And the filmmakers make you believe in him. You believe this giant monster really exists. And you also believe he really loves Ann. When the monster's heart breaks your heart breaks for him. The technological wizardry that brings Kong to life is astounding. In 1933 nobody had ever seen anything quite like it. Decades later the effects may seem mundane. But in its time producing this film was a magnificent achievement. You can nitpick and say that King Kong, while certainly a good film, is for this reason or that maybe not a truly great film. But there is no denying that is an absolutely monumental, iconic film. Some great films come and go and end up largely forgotten. Icons live forever. Kong remains King.

Long before I had ever actually seen the movie, I had encountered enough promo stills, clips and review that I felt like I had seen the movie anyways. It feels almost a part of American folklore at this point.We all know the plot by now. A doctor, played by Kevin McCarthy has returned from a trip to find that his town is slowly losing their mind (or are they?). Seems people feel that their neighbors are no longer their neighbors, like they've been replaced by doppelgangers. While on a date with an old flame one night the doctor gets an emergency call from a town couple who have discovered a body that isn't quite human. At this point, the doctor realizes that this is not mass hypnosis, but something far more sinister going on.It's essentially a chase movie. Once the action kicks into gear, the majority of the movie is spent with our heroes trying to stay a few steps ahead of the impending menace. The sense of dread is palpable in this movie. As things start to unfold the director does an amazing job of creating a claustrophobic feeling in the town, as things begin to close in on our heroes. We despair along with them that there may be no escape.The greatest thing, I feel, about this movie is the natural fears that it plays upon so well. Many have speculated on the themes of the movie. Is it a commentary of communist fears and the McCarthy era? Is it a commentary on conformity? There are plenty of well-written reviews that can expound on both of those ideas, so I won't bog mine down with them. I will say that the natural fear I was referring to is fear of your neighbors, fear that no place is really safe, fear that the people you know and love aren't quite what they seem. All of these have a role in this movie.Overall, it holds up very well all these years later. The acting is pretty good all around and doesn't feel as dated as some acting technique that you see in older movies. The movie looks gorgeous and crisp. The only real negative I could throw out is the effects, which obviously look dated. I found the pods the characters carry around to look fairly silly, at this point, like overgrown brussels sprouts, but we can't really hold that against a 60-yr old movie.Yes, like most I would say that the 70s version is my favorite, mostly because it feels a little more fresh for today's audience, but the original is still a classic worth watching.

A doctor, played by Kevin McCarthy has returned from a trip to find that his town is slowly losing their mind (or are they?). Seems people feel that their neighbors are no longer their neighbors, like they've been replaced by doppelgangers. While on a date with an old flame one night the doctor gets an emergency call from a town couple who have discovered a body that isn't quite human. At this point, the doctor realizes that this is not mass hypnosis, but something far more sinister going on.It's essentially a chase movie. Once the action kicks into gear, the majority of the movie is spent with our heroes trying to stay a few steps ahead of the impending menace. The sense of dread is palpable in this movie. As things start to unfold the director does an amazing job of creating a claustrophobic feeling in the town, as things begin to close in on our heroes. We despair along with them that there may be no escape.The greatest thing, I feel, about this movie is the natural fears that it plays upon so well. Many have speculated on the themes of the movie. Is it a commentary of communist fears and the McCarthy era? Is it a commentary on conformity? There are plenty of well-written reviews that can expound on both of those ideas, so I won't bog mine down with them. I will say that the natural fear I was referring to is fear of your neighbors, fear that no place is really safe, fear that the people you know and love aren't quite what they seem. All of these have a role in this movie.Overall, it holds up very well all these years later. The acting is pretty good all around and doesn't feel as dated as some acting technique that you see in older movies. The movie looks gorgeous and crisp. The only real negative I could throw out is the effects, which obviously look dated. I found the pods the characters carry around to look fairly silly, at this point, like overgrown brussels sprouts, but we can't really hold that against a 60-yr old movie.Yes, like most I would say that the 70s version is my favorite, mostly because it feels a little more fresh for today's audience, but the original is still a classic worth watching.

It made the movie original, without going too far from the sources. One thing was totally wrong though, and I think this fact almost wrecks the whole movie. In the beginning Lancelot is pictured like some poor show-man, almost a con artist, who gives sword-shows for money in public places. This is something that the real Lancelot (I mean the Lancelot we all know) would never have done. As everybody knows, he was born a prince and got a magical upbringing with The Lady of the Lake. When he reached manhood, she brought him to King Arthur's court. At this time he was already a knight in armour. There can never have been a time in Lancelot's life, when he had to give shows for money in public squares (however successfully). This started the movie on completely the wrong note, and I almost stopped watching then and there!Also, Richard Gere is wrong for the role. First, he is too American. The first request for someone playing the leads in a Camelot story, must be their Brittishness... Also, Richard Gere is not handsome enough - although I HAVE found him attractive in other kinds of roles, such as well-tailored lawyers and businessmen in the city. But he is not handsome in the way we think of Lancelot as handsome extremely muscular, fit and manly, and at the same time unearthly, spiritual and saint-like... Richard Gere in this movie looks like any peasant!Julia Ormond was also the wrong choice for Guinevere. The only thing that was right about her was her slim and straight figure. Her face is much too ordinary, and there is no glamour at all around her. Sean Connery is perfect as King Arthur, though. VERY British, handsome, manly, regal and fear-inspiring when he is supposed to be fear-inspiring. Also a great actor, as ever.Also, I did not like that they changed the ending. In this movie, it was hinted at that Lancelot and Guinevere could have each other - now when the King was dead. This is nowhere in the original sources. And the love triangle is supposed to be a tragedy, not a happy ending! First Knight is a darker, bleaker and more realistic take on Camelot, but there are still things that make it worth watching the wonderful castle in itself, and the whole medieval world with lavish gowns, armour, horses, battle-scenes etc..

I was literally exhausted but I wanted to perk myself up with something awe- inspiring for boosting my spent brain. I decided to type in Google The best movie ever and then appeared the Top 250 from IMBDb, the world's most popular source for movies and TV shows. The first one was called The Shawshank Redemption by Frank Darabond, and I started to watch it without stopping even a second. It was a movie about an imprisoned man searching for freedom, That's exactly what I need tonight I said to myself. As the movie was moving forward, I became more disappointed, maybe because of my bad mood and my great expectations about the movie. I was watching THE movie, not merely another one to pass the time. What was happening? Asking myself this question I realized that it was my fault and I decided to watch the movie through a different lens and have a positive attitude. From then on, everything changed, my blindness disappeared and the film met my expectations It perked me up and gave me goosebumps. In the final scene, I was crying like a child, I felt a little foolish. Every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The story is incredibly well narrated, it keeps you interested throughout the film, it provides all the information you need to follow along, and is completely believable, even Andy is a kind of genius and has to put in practice astonishing ideas for escape from the prison. Analyzing the back-story, it was a high budget film and I'm sure it is the masterpiece of Frank Darabont and Tim Robbins (at least). The characters are played well, seemed like real people and I especially love Andy's one, I will never forget the sarcastic smile of Tim Robbins withdrawing money from his false account. Film prop and costumes are useful and fits the mood, and musical score by Thomas Newman helps move the movie along. Regarding the filming techniques, the use of long takes, close ups, and slow zooms toward the characters make the story intimate enough to affect the audience. Finally, in relation to its pacing and organization I think the film flows well, not too short or too long. On the other hand, if you ask me for the weak points of the movie, I could point out the Tommy storyline. We already know Andy is innocent and we know also how corrupt the system is. What's the point of that? My overall verdict 8\/10. A great movie, but not the best movie ever by far.

The creators themselves broke apart the first one and made something almost completely new. HR 2 though only credits Barker as producer and co-writer, and Tony Randel was in the director's chair so he's not totally responsible for this newish scene. But it still is strange that he let the mythos he created to veer off in a new direction and for different things to be emphasized. Hellbound only starts a few hours after the first film and they started filming it a few weeks after they filmed the first one, it's still so different as the story allows despite the fact that it follows so closely on the heels of the first one. Of course that doesn't mean that the film is bad, in fact in a lot of ways it's really good. It's just that that original genius is lost and it sways to a whole different dimension. Doctor Channard is sent a new patient, a girl warning of the terrible creatures that have destroyed her family, Cenobites who offer the most intense sensations of pleasure and pain. But Channard has been searching for the doorway to Hell for years, and Kirsty must follow him to save her father and witness the power struggles among the newly damned. Peter Atkins with his first film and Barker didn't spend time on the script. A little bloodshed, a little chase and there you go the film is done. It's a typical sequel in the sense that it just needs to be more more brutal in this case. But hey you can't complain when there is so much that can turn your stomach, blood is spilling, meat is tearing right? And when an insane guy goes ahead and tries to cut the bugs and creepy crawlies from his skin with a razor even the most tried and tested horror geeks have a second of feeling they would rather hide their eyes. But you won't and that's the beauty of it. And it must be said that a few of the effects really look good. Unfortunately along with the gory stuff there isn't time for the horror elements used in the first one, that means that the characters are less defined than the effects. Even if we get to see Julia deskined she still isn't as scary as in the first part with just a hammer. Tiffany is kind of a pointless character, Frank's short scene is that too. So only the quiet at first then scary as hell Dr. Channard carries the film. Kenneth Cranham is awesome. The demons of the first film that were scary when they just stood in one spot and stared at the camera get an origin story in this film. That's kind of a mistake with a character whose whole creepiness lies in the mystery surrounding them. And we meet a new Cenobite that wrecks the old ones in a minute. I thought they were scary, immoral, untouchable, unbeatable demons? What gives? The idea of them being defeated would have been laughable in the first film and even if they try to give all this a logical expanaition it doesn't change the result. Hell's depiction though is great for a while, but running around in the same darkened hallway and tunnel gets massively boring and repetitive in the end. Less would have been more. But the whole asylum's basement halls being a kind of hell is a great idea All in all Hellraiser's sequel has traces of the first part but looses what was so unique about it.

First off this is probably due to the fact that it was made not by a known American film studio but has come to us from Mexico. The film of course carries the director Guillermo del Toro's thumbprint, who has left his mark in the histories of film with his dark fairy tales and fantasies. Films like Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy 1-2 and Mimic, okay so there not all fantastic films and I didn't even mention Blade 2, but you can't dismiss the fact that they all show the director's unique style and it's kind of interesting to see how early these stylistic markers showed up in his earlier work. Cronos was his first feature film, for which of course he also wrote the script and it's not surprising that it began his carrier. The film was a powerhouse and nabbed a heap of awards too, the critics loved it and that's not surprising, it didn't become one of horror fans favorite classics by accident. The story In 1535, an alchemist builds an extraordinary mechanism encapsulated into a small golden device. The invention, designed to convey eternal life to its owner, survives its maker until 1997, when it shows up with an antiques dealer. Fascinated with the strange device, Gris doesn't note that there's more than one person looking for it. The promise of eternal life has become an obsession for old and sick Mr. De la Guardia . He and his nephew (Ron Perlman) will do anything to get the Cronos Invention.. This film isn't just a horror it's a drama, which is mostly the case with films not made in the States, it almost has the same arch as European horror films usually do. Its first objective is not cheap thrills but rather a story being told, which carries within it the darkness, violence and death which is scary. It's a more art film representation of horror and it achieved a level of beauty that helps you really feel the drama of the contrast between life and death. So in this sense it isn't that far away from the usual vampire films, take for instance Interview with the Vampire which has a similar central theme. Cronos' story is about the pain and suffering of living forever, so it reminds me of The Hunger that Tony Scott directed. Del Toro was spot on with the direction and the script was fabulous. He took the casting seriously too, with his favorite Argentine actor Federico Luppi and the very characteristic Ron Perlman, who was perfect in the role of the violent, little bit crazy cousin. The not too complicated basic story is compensated by the effects that are pretty disgusting, just think at one point the Jesus character rips his own skin off. It was an added bonus that they sneaked some humor into the morgue scenes, that type of thing is where del Toro's genius lies, despite the serious theme, message and the monsters he can still be humorous without making the whole thing pathetic. The director paid for some of the film from his own pocket (with a bank loan) and the masks were made by his own effects co. he even has a cameo as and his wife walk their dog in front of the protagonists house. Though artsy beauty sometimes stamps out the apprehensiveness and thrills of a horror and doesn't make us release adrenaline, this film is not boring, rather its deep and serious while still being entertaining. It's unique so I give it an 8\/10 https\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/Videodromeblog ","genre":null},{"date":"23 August 2014","score":"","review":" Cronos is a story about vampires, but not anything like we're used to.

The film was a powerhouse and nabbed a heap of awards too, the critics loved it and that's not surprising, it didn't become one of horror fans favorite classics by accident. The story In 1535, an alchemist builds an extraordinary mechanism encapsulated into a small golden device. The invention, designed to convey eternal life to its owner, survives its maker until 1997, when it shows up with an antiques dealer. Fascinated with the strange device, Gris doesn't note that there's more than one person looking for it. The promise of eternal life has become an obsession for old and sick Mr. De la Guardia . He and his nephew (Ron Perlman) will do anything to get the Cronos Invention.. This film isn't just a horror it's a drama, which is mostly the case with films not made in the States, it almost has the same arch as European horror films usually do. Its first objective is not cheap thrills but rather a story being told, which carries within it the darkness, violence and death which is scary. It's a more art film representation of horror and it achieved a level of beauty that helps you really feel the drama of the contrast between life and death. So in this sense it isn't that far away from the usual vampire films, take for instance Interview with the Vampire which has a similar central theme. Cronos' story is about the pain and suffering of living forever, so it reminds me of The Hunger that Tony Scott directed. Del Toro was spot on with the direction and the script was fabulous. He took the casting seriously too, with his favorite Argentine actor Federico Luppi and the very characteristic Ron Perlman, who was perfect in the role of the violent, little bit crazy cousin. The not too complicated basic story is compensated by the effects that are pretty disgusting, just think at one point the Jesus character rips his own skin off. It was an added bonus that they sneaked some humor into the morgue scenes, that type of thing is where del Toro's genius lies, despite the serious theme, message and the monsters he can still be humorous without making the whole thing pathetic. The director paid for some of the film from his own pocket (with a bank loan) and the masks were made by his own effects co. he even has a cameo as and his wife walk their dog in front of the protagonists house. Though artsy beauty sometimes stamps out the apprehensiveness and thrills of a horror and doesn't make us release adrenaline, this film is not boring, rather its deep and serious while still being entertaining. It's unique so I give it an 8\/10 https\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/Videodromeblog ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"23 August 2014","score":"","review":" Cronos is a story about vampires, but not anything like we're used to. First off this is probably due to the fact that it was made not by a known American film studio but has come to us from Mexico. The film of course carries the director Guillermo del Toro's thumbprint, who has left his mark in the histories of film with his dark fairy tales and fantasies.
