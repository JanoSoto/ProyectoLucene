I think they are cool, scary and make for awesome movie monsters. I own An American Werewolf in London and it's one of the best werewolf movies ever. I had heard of the Howling (and fact is, I had seen Part 5 and 6 on a Howling marathon on SciFi channel a couple of years ago). I had heard that many people considered The Howling to be superior to AWiL, so of course I wanted to see it. I ordered it and cheerfully popped it into my DVD the other night. Boy, was I surprised!The movie was awful! The acting, the story, the pace, the lightning, the cast, the soundtrack... everything! Everything was wrong! It wasn't horrible, but it was bad. The whole feel of the film was that of a really, really cheesy, old horror movie which was just made to cash in some bucks (I'm not saying the movie wasn't made with love, but the it felt that way!).The werewolf transformation scene was awful. Horrible. It didn't look like the guy was going to transform into a werewolf, it looked like he was going to turn into the Marshmellow Man from Ghostbusters. Someone said that they liked the Howling transformation scene better because it looked more painful. I disagree. It didn't look the least painful. It kinda looked like the character didn't mind at all. Whereas in AWiL, the character was screaming in agony and you see how painful of a process it was.The ending was also horrible. First of all, the part where they revealed that the whole colony were werewolves. Wow. Original. And the way it was portrayed made it seem like a cheesy Twilight Zone episode. This feeling was kept until the REAL ending (I won't spoil it, but you who have seen the film know what I'm talking about). It was so horrible. So bad. Oh hell...There was ONE redeeming factor. And that was that the werewolves themselves (who didn't appear until an hour into this 89 minute long movie) were really well done. They could move their face really well, and looked like real werewolves (but they didn't look anything like what we were lead to believe by the transformation process). But while watching the movie, I didn't compare it to AWiL, keep that in mind. I just watched it and thought I was in for good werewolf flick. But this wasn't that much of a werewolf flick. I mean, we didn't really see that many werewolves. Maybe four or so. That was about it.I give it a 3 out 10. 2 for the werewolves and 1 for the rest.

Dreams run rampat throughout each characters life and exclude none. We see Harry's dream of wanting to marry the love of his life and make it to the 'big time'. His love, Marion, has the dream to one day own a clothing line or shop of some sort. This dream is seemingly going to be supplied by the selling of drugs but is in actuallity takin away by this devastating habit. The way the movie painstakingly presents these two dreams makes the audience immediatly relate to the characters on a deep level. These dreams are held by many people and this movie succeeds tremendously on the level of making this movie appeal to the vast majority.Sara(Ellen Burnstyn) presents the viewer with her dream to be on television. This dream is caused by the intrinsic notion for acceptance by not only herself but from other people. Tyron(Marlon Wayans) dreams are induced by his childhood rollmodel, his mother. Again all dreams that instantly hook the viewer with its glaring reality.Throughout the movie the dreams are presented as a mirage and only that. In comes the harsh reality of drug use and the murder that insues. Not the murder of a person but of a dream. The way this movie presents the decay is realistic in every way and presents the viewer with the harsh reality that drug ensues on its victims. A killer of dreams.FormThis flick encorporates many different elements taken out of thin air by the awe-inspiring Darren Aronofsky. With every frame the viewer recieves a new mood ranging from pure utopia to complete chaos. The scene that comes to mind is Marion in the bathroom. She is initially undrugged and normal. Somehow this shot makes the viewer feel normal. Then it cuts to a utopic shot where the viewer is incorporated into the drugged out state of mind.The film brillantly blends the chaotic form with the unscathed at the beginning and slowly goes to pure pandamonium. At the beggininng Aronofsky sprinkles a little bit of turmoil into an otherwise unchaotic movie. This is how,in reality, the use of drugs begins. This is why so many get hooked and the way that thhis movie uses the frames to elaborate on this is beautiful.The climax of this story is done to perfection. We go from each story as they get more chaotic. As the commotion builds the movie goes from scene to scene more quickly until they all intertwine into one climax.(as I am new to the world of movies and know little about form and such, I will not elaborate any further)ActingEllen Burnstyn is the gem in this catagory. You never feel that this is an acting job, but rather a reality especially in her drug-induced speed frenzies. She potrays her character very well at all times, from her beggining as a scared but loving and lonely parent. To her days of desperation as a drug addict with a broken dream. The viewer always feels her loneliness and desperation to be back where she once was.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 April 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Requiem-Mass for the souls of the deadDreamsRequiem For a Dream is not only a movie about drugs, but a movie about dreams and the inherent loss of those dreams.

If you have seen the remake and found it too slow, too boring, then you must not watch the original. I didn't find the movie boring, although I have to admit there are scenes that seem to go on forever, one with a freeway in particular.The story is about a planet named Solaris and a space station in an orbit around it. Strange things are happening on the station so Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) goes there to investigate certain things. There are supposed to be three other people on the station. One of them has died, one of them Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) at first doesn't want to talk with him and one of them Dr. Snaut (Jüri Järvet) does tell him things but is a little vague about what is happening. After Kris' first night on the station his late wife (Natalya Bondarchuk) wakes up next to him. Although this is not his real wife but something created by Solaris from Kris his own memories he sees her as his wife. Now that Kris has a Guest, like Sartorius and Snaut, Sartorius wants to talk with him about the events, about Solaris and about its creations. It is not that Kris' wife is only seen by him. Sartorius and Snaut see her too and they even talk with her. She has intelligence although she only knows what Kris knows about her since that is what Solaris knows from him.It is hard to explain exactly what the movie shows us and even tells us. The ending makes sure that we are even more unsure. Of course I will not reveal it but it makes the movie even more interesting. The most interesting thing is how Kris responds to his Guest. He knows she is not his real wife, she even knows it, but still she loves that what he sees.Like I said, there are very slow parts in the movie. Kubrick's '2001 A Space Odyssey' also has the slow moments but there the images and the beautiful classical music keep us interested and fascinated.

He knows she is not his real wife, she even knows it, but still she loves that what he sees.Like I said, there are very slow parts in the movie. Kubrick's '2001 A Space Odyssey' also has the slow moments but there the images and the beautiful classical music keep us interested and fascinated. 'Solaris' doesn't have the music but the images are there to enjoy as well. The movie could have been shorter but because it takes the time to explore things we can take the time to think about that while enjoying some great images. You should give it a try.

But it's highly unlikely the movie would have drummed up serious business stateside had it been theatrically released.For one thing - as many people here have commented - the movie is not a very faithful adaptation of the comic book. The white skull is missing. The Punisher is not a motorcycle rider. His family tragedy is completely different. And on and on. Supposedly, the filmmakers were restricted in their use of the licence of the character - you have to then wonder why New World even bothered in the first place instead of making their own vigilante character.But how about looking at the movie in another angle, as a straightforward action movie? Well, it's not much betterACTION - There are a few action moments that aren't bad - the dock shootout, the samurai massacre - but otherwise the action is mediocre at best. One reoccuring problem is the action doesn't flow smoothly from shot to shot, either from bad editing or a poor choice in direction.ACTING - It's not that the actors can't act, it's just that the screenplay gives them very little to do. Lundgren actually has a few (very) brief moments when he actually gives a convincing display of his character's madness. But he has hardly any dialogue, and in fact almost becomes a supporting character. Gossett's character spends much of the movie just hanging and snooping around.PRODUCTION VALUES - Pretty cheap, for one thing. There's an early restaurant scene that shot in the far corner of the restaurant, and only showing one other customer! But cheapness isn't the only thing wrong. The movie was shot in Australia, and in just about every scene you see something that doesn't belong in an American setting, like the police cars for example. (And don't get me started on the Australian accents that keep creeping in.)THE SCREENPLAY - As I mentioned earlier, the characters are thin and with nothing to make them stand out. The movie also refuses to carry out the few interesting (and more original) ideas that do come across, and make them into something that's *really* memorable. Mostly the story seems to be a patchwork of ideas we've both seen before and in the way they are presented here.Very disappointing... but I'll admit it could have been much worse.

Certainly, Roger Moore would never be believable in a Sean Connery-type Bond film, but couldn't some of the series' best elements be restored, and the comedy reduced a bit, to make Moore's Bond a bit more believable?The research, which became the basis of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, took over two years to complete, and the script went through many writers before the final draft, by Christopher Wood and Richard Maibaum. With a renewed emphasis on more realistic action, Broccoli brought back Lewis Gilbert to direct; his earlier Bond effort, YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, while not a major 'hit', had featured the most spectacular action sequences of the series. With Gilbert on board, the production became very reminiscent of the Connery film (Even the concept of a supertanker 'swallowing' submarines echoed YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, and the spacecraft-'eating' SPECTRE capsule). As the villain, esteemed German actor Curt Jurgens was cast as Karl Stromberg, an ideal choice, as the actor, with his bulging eyes, 'fit' the role of a fish-like megalomaniac. Playing his henchman, Jaws, in an inspired piece of casting, giant Richard Kiel, complete with 'bear-trap' steel teeth, would provide Moore with the greatest danger he'd ever face as Bond. Kiel was, in fact, so good in the role (possibly the most popular villain of the entire 007 franchise), that he would return in MOONRAKER, to bedevil Bond some more. Less successful, dramatically, but still astonishing to watch would be Stromberg's 'hit woman', Naomi, played by voluptuous Caroline Munro.In an effort to 'update' Bond into an era of feminists, the strongest, most independent love interest to appear in at Bond film to that point was introduced. Major Anya Amasova, played by Ringo Starr's wife, the exotically beautiful Barbara Bach, was Bond's opposite number on the Russian side, an equal to 007 in every way. In a pivotal scene, she would display a knowledge of Bond's past that even included his dead wife, Tracy (the first time Bond's marriage had been mentioned since ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE). Moore's reaction to her comment would be both emotional and abrupt, and demonstrated that he could do far more than just deliver witty one-liners.From the spectacular ski chase pre-title sequence, climaxing with a parachute free fall off a cliff (love that 'Union Jack'), to Bond and Anya's confrontations with Jaws, in Egypt (reminiscent of Bond's fights with Oddjob in GOLDFINGER and Tee Hee in LIVE AND LET DIE), to the amazing Lotus that would do service on land and in the ocean, to the massive tanker battle while Bond disarms a nuclear warhead (shades of GOLDFINGER), THE SPY WHO LOVED ME would do homage to 007's previous adventures, and utilize humor in support of the on-screen action, instead of spoofing it (other than the brief use of the LAWRENCE OF ARABIA theme...you'll spot it).And to top things off, Carly Simon's rendition of the film's title tune, Nobody Does It Better, would become a Top Ten hit, worldwide.Critics and audiences loved THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, hailing it as Moore's best work, and one of the better Bonds of all time.

Don't miss the beginning of the movie as you need some of the information given during that time of the move.  Well, that's all but I hope that you found this review helpful!

I'm not talking about omissions because of the limitations of movie making. I'm talking about outright lies. I can almost forgive making stuff up about B&C since they were a couple of dirt bags, but I can't forgive making Frank Hamer (mispronounced in the movie) and other lawmen look like fools.Frank's service to society was quite remarkable. It was so remarkable that the justified slaughter of B&C was but a footnote to his illustrious career. And what of the officers and innocents killed or injured by the Barrow gang? The movie makes their loss seem like so much fun at the penny arcade. Director Penn should be ashamed.I doubt the positive reviewers of this film would be so quick to praise a movie that made Charlie Manson's group out to be a fun-loving bunch of misguided hippies. This is the exact sort of thing this movie did. The only difference is how old the crimes are. In fact in terms of the suffering they caused, the Barrow gang was worse than Manson. Those that glowingly praise this movie would be well served to crack a history book once in a while. I suggest Milner's The Lives and Times of Bonnie and Clyde.If you do decide to read about B&C, you'll be surprised to find that some of the most interesting facts were left out of the movie. For example They broke one of their buddies out of a major Texas prison from the outside. Clyde was a small Beaver-Cleaver-looking guy who deftly used a large machine gun (a Browning Automatic Rifle) because tommy guns, which are revered by Hollywood and used in this movie, could not reliably penetrate the steel of early 30s cars. And best of all, they really loved each other. All that lover's tension and sexual dysfunction in the movie is BS.The actors did a decent job. They probably didn't even know that the script had very little to do with Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker. Even if they did know, they probably wouldn't care. The casting was horrible, but hey, once you cast off the annoying constraints of what actually happened, who cares? If the movie had been titled Bob and Suzy, it would have been worth watching in its day. Even if it were, these days it would be a waste of time.

When he asked why, they said it didn't count as science fiction because it wasn't set in outer space like Star Trek and Star Wars. Jim shot back that it was science fiction because it dealt with time travel and cyborgs. This was significant for science fiction film making because, as much fun as those out of this world galaxies are, science fiction can still be compelling when set on Earth. The film also made a star out of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Well, technically Conan the Barbarian did that, but Terminator helped him break out of costume films and get into the shoot 'em ups.Arnold plays the title character, a robot in human skin sent back to 1984 LA to kill Sarah Connor (a 28 year old Linda Hamilton with her hair dyed dirty blond), a good natured but lonely, somewhat scatter-brained, hapless waitress who has no idea of just how important she really is she's the mother of John Connor, the man who will save what's left of the human race in the year 2019 when the machines have almost succeeded in taking over the world. Sarah's only hope is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn, who later starred in James Cameron's Aliens and The Abyss), a soldier sent back from the future to protect her from the Terminator. Chaos and mayhem ensue, along with a high body count and the unexpected love story between Sarah & Kyle, the latter who turns out to be John Connor's father. Oh the irony of Kyle's response to Sarah's question about John's father John never said much about him... I know he dies before the war.Yes, some of the special effects are dated (namely the puppet head used for the scene where the Terminator cuts out its damaged eye and a few of the stop motion effects) and it's set in its era and it kind of runs out of steam towards the end, but the rest of the film is great it's dark, it's eerie, it's seamy, it's atmospheric, it's violent, it's got pretty much everything. Arnold dominates pretty much every scene he's in. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are sympathetic protagonists.Personally, I like this one better than the sequels, possibly because there's no Edward Furlong in it. The big difference between the films is that the original was more of a thriller, an extended chase scene, whereas the sequels were more about style and special effects and blow you away action sequences. But it's all good in the end. This is also a great examination of what could happen should technology get out of hand, ala Blade Runner.The DVD has two options of sound effects, the old mono system and a newer, more sophisticated one. I highly advise you not to listen to the newer sound system because it makes everything in the film sound really fake. The DVD also has deleted scenes, mostly notably a scene where Reese suffers an emotional break down over being displaced in time, an angle that never surfaced in the film but would have been very interesting to bring up.I'll be back.

Darren Aronofsky does an excellent work, surely his best until now. And, `Requiem' is probably the best of its genre, and the most realistic I've ever seen. It tells the story of four lives, each with their own addictions to drugs, and how they start to go down the drain as the months passes and as the story progresses.Spoilers `Requiem For A Dream' is a simple story. It involves the lives of four people, Harold (Jared Leto), Marion (Jennifer Connely), Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and Mrs. Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Harold's mother. As the story starts, Aronofsky introduces us to the characters, what are they addictions, their daily behavior, how they interact with people, their dreams, aspirations, etc. Harold and Tyrone are partners in the drug business, and they start doing business on the streets, consequently the money comes rolling in. They consume it, they sell it, and they buy it. Meanwhile, Mrs. Goldfarb receives a call, a call that says that she is soon to be appearing on her favorite TV show. She thinks the call is a prank call, to cheat her, but, with full of hope and simplicity, she decides to trust in the person on the other side of the line. As the opportunity to appear in a TV program becomes more real, she decides to get thinner, entering also, in a world of drugs. A different kind of drugs, but one as dangerous as the ones her son, Harold, was consuming. As the months pass, passing from Summer to Winter, their state of mind and physical appearance start to decrease. The addiction to drugs starts to increase. The number of drugs in the city is constantly decreasing. This factor takes Tyrone and Harold to Philadelphia to buy some new drugs, but as they arrive there, they don't expect what's waiting for them. Marion is the most addicted, she can't live without drugs. She decides to get drugs through other means. Mrs. Goldfarb starts to get annoyed by the fact that the TV program doesn't get back to her, and eventually her mind starts getting tired. The consequences of these actions and behavior are the most realistic and spine-chilling I've ever seen. End of Spoilers`Requiem' is marked, mainly, by its morbid direction. Darren Aronofsky has done a fantastic job. He uses quick shots to represent the use of drugs, to demonstrate how the drugs affect the brain it's quick. The visuals of the film are absolutely spectacular. I've never seen nothing like that. I had already seen `Pi', and the direction of it isn't much different than `Requiem', but, either way, I was absolutely astonished. The acting is very realistic, specially Ellen Burstyn's. I know many people have said this, but it doesn't hurt saying it again best performance since `The Exorcist', she should have won the Oscar, surely. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connely are perfect, portraying the teen couple, who are deeply in love, but unfortunately, are addicted to drugs. Marlon Wayans has his best performance of all time as Tyrone C. Love(jumps from `Scary Movie' to the best film he has ever done). The plot is very absorbing and, without a doubt, thought-provoking. Along with the direction, the score by Clint Mansell cooperating with The   , is one of the best in the movie industry. It was as absorbing as the plot. Absolutely magnificent. Great soundtrack.Finally, `Requiem For A Dream' is the best film I've ever seen about drugs, and the most realistic. After seeing this one, you'll see the world of drugs with another perspective. Either you'll like it, or you won't. Are you the kind of person that accepts reality as it is, or, are you the kind of person that just wants to ignore it?

Marlon Wayans has his best performance of all time as Tyrone C. Love(jumps from `Scary Movie' to the best film he has ever done). The plot is very absorbing and, without a doubt, thought-provoking. Along with the direction, the score by Clint Mansell cooperating with The   , is one of the best in the movie industry. It was as absorbing as the plot. Absolutely magnificent. Great soundtrack.Finally, `Requiem For A Dream' is the best film I've ever seen about drugs, and the most realistic. After seeing this one, you'll see the world of drugs with another perspective. Either you'll like it, or you won't. Are you the kind of person that accepts reality as it is, or, are you the kind of person that just wants to ignore it? One thing's for sure, it will definitely raise in you quite a number of moral issues.PsIKiLL's Rating 9\/10  ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"7 April 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  If the failure of THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN resulted in producer Albert Broccoli's returning to an earlier, THUNDERBALL\/YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE approach to 007 film making, the disastrous reviews of MOONRAKER had the producer looking back even further...to the grittier, low-tech world of Ian Fleming, in fact.The film, combining elements of several Bond short stories (as well as the climactic Live and Let Die 'shark dragging' sequence) would introduce a tougher, more physically active Roger Moore, in the kind of 'rough and tumble' performance everyone assumed only Sean Connery could pull off.

He has brought to USA a breath of fresh air with his low-key powerful direction (resembling John Sayles' Limbo, at times). Take the final scene--in my opinion the finest part of a well thought-out film. The camera captures three graves (son, wife, mother?). Leticia's face subtly changes from repulsion\/fear to love\/respect. Hank's offers the ice cream with a sense of fulfillment, of redemption, an exorcism of all the ills of the past. If I were Marc Forster my instinct would have been to end the film with a mid-shot of the two faces looking at the camera. But surprise, surprise! Forster chooses to take a reverse angle shot with the camera going behind the two heads, capturing the dark sky of the night they are savouring.Decades ago films from Hollywood ended with lovers riding into the sunset with grandoise music. For Forster, the dark, silent finale says it all--a new life order, a sense of reconciliation (at a level higher than two races, an executioner turning redeemer), a toast to three individuals (buried in the garden) who died fighting dark forces around them, a life where income (an important undercurrent in the film) comes from providing fuel and not from keeping people behind bars. The end of the film is powerful in its simplicity and understatements.Another strength of the film is its European feel in the taut script and editing. A lot is said without words spoken--choice of Hank's seats in the restaurant, with his back to other customers but yet near to them, the sale of the wedding ring, the photograph of the executed prisoner in Leticia's bathroom after the sex sequence, the allegory of the caged bird, painting Leticia's name over the gas station, cleaning the blood off the handbag, the red curtains bought on credit, etc.Forster is one of the few directors who have used the sex encounters (all four in the movie) to flesh out the characters. The sexual preferences of father and son (and grandfather?) do not seem to be very different, while externally the older generations seem to be less adapted to changes--or is it a comment on the contribution of the two wives never shown alive in the film.The slow transformation of Hank--from the son who listens to the father to the son who forces his father to live in an old age home--is more a contribution of Forster than Thornton. Of course, Thornton was great to watch on screen.Similarly, Leticia's slow uptake on Hank's role in her husband's death and her relationship with money (gathering fallen coins while paying the cab, the growing tips at the restaurant, to the purchase of the expensive hat when she has to pay her bills) are built up with care by Forster and wonderfully executed by the actors.Bruce Beresford's Tender Mercies attempted a similar essay in American cinema, but Forster has proved his mettle in this wonderful movie experience. Even though most people only seem to have noticed the performances of the actors in this lovely movie, evidently directors like Forster and Julie Taymor can provide good American cinema for discerning, mature audiences in the near future.
