The acting in this movie was dreadful. George Clooney was miscast as Batman. He's not a bad actor, but he shouldn't have picked this. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze was AWFUL! AWFUL! I'm glad he retired because he is a horrible actor, except for the Terminator movies. Chris O'Donnell was the only person who walked away unscathed after the failure of this movie. Uma Thurman gave the most over-the-top performance I have ever seen as Poison Ivy. Alicia Silverstone was also miscast as Batgirl, and her character was unneeded. One of the things I did like about the movie was the cinematography. I thought it was pretty cool. But the movie feels like a 2-hour commercial. The fight scenes are poorly staged, the actors are miscast, and Uma Thurman's acting is too improvised. Overall, if you are in the mood for a movie too laugh at, then definitely check this out.

De Palma's the problem here - he's really the kind of director who needs to stay away from serious subject matters, because he's too ham-fisted to handle it with any tact. He does very well with more B-level stuff, and he can definitely be masterful in movies like Carrie and Sisters (though he screws that stuff up as often as not, too). Casualties of War is about a five-person squadron (Michael J. Fox, John Leguizamo, John C. Reilly, Don Harvey and led by Sean Penn) who kidnap a teenage Vietnamese girl, march her into the jungle, rape her and then murder her. Fox is the lone objector in the group, but there's nothing he can do to stop them. He's just a private under Penn's command. Plus, they all have guns and are presumably better at using them than he is. When the group returns from the mission, Fox tries to do the right thing and bring about justice, but his superiors (including Ving Rhames) are mostly unwilling to listen. Yeah, this is powerful stuff. The problem is, De Palma doesn't think we will know that if he just presents it. He has to throw it at us, underlining every little thing, and giving the actors big speeches (one particular shot with Fox seems so clearly to be meant as his Oscar clip that I had to giggle). The worst part of the film by far is the score. Who wrote it? None other than the great Ennio Morricone. I guess everyone has an off day, but I've never heard Morricone deliver a score that was even mediocre (okay, maybe his John Carpenter knock-off score for The Thing). This one is downright putrid. The whole film is terribly overscored. I think that was done to go along with Sean Penn's overacting. The guy's frequently been accused of overdoing it, but generally I think his methody style works. Not here. He's never been worse. By comparison, Michael J. Fox actually isn't half bad. It's pretty clear he wasn't meant for heavy drama, though. Brian De Palma made a startlingly similar movie about the Iraq War in 2007, the even worse Redacted. I know both of these stories are true and they certainly are both subjects worthy of a film treatment, but De Palma was not the one to do it. And, having done both of these movies, it almost seems like he has a beef with U.S. soldiers.

Another one of those movies that are timeless. Americans do not care where they get their heroes ,even if its born out of violence and murder. This movie was not necessarily pre internet,but about the onset of the internet, where the internet is irrelevant. Still this film showcased 2 young murderers , Mickey and Mallory Knox, that terrorized small southwestern towns in and around NM.Also you had intertwined were clips from the old TV shows, like Beaver. I guess Mr. Stone wanted to show how America is an obsessed TV society and feel insulated from the outside world. Deep movie with lots of symbolism. I digress. M and M were bonded by bad childhoods and somehow they become a twisted Romeo and Juliet. Notice the ironies when you watch this movie. Close ups of the dead animal on the pickup and various close ups and references to snakes. Basically Mr. Stone is bearing out that humans are no different than wild animals or reptiles. The acting was wonderful. Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Downey Jr. , Yes even Rodney Dangerfield in flashback role as the child molesting father of Mallory. These were articulate murderers that wanted notoriety. Thus they always kept around one person from their bloodbath rage to 'tell the story' of Mickey and Mallory . Robert Downey Jr. was excellent as the reporter looking for fame in using Mickey and Mallory for his own selfish reasons. Depressing film in the sense of how it views human nature. Sadly, though its on the mark. I can not give it a 10 because some of the happenings were far fetched. The movie had a spoofiness about it that holds well today.Remember too, This movie came out right before the OJ Simpson tragedy.

Would it have been less appealing? Well, it's a hard question to answer.Mainly because the editing goes strictly linked to the title and the condition of the leading character, but also helps you in a very subtle manner to transcend from the position of viewer to the one of a character in the movie... It helps you identify to the character and beyond...Maybe a slight reminder of the Fugitive theme, that only makes one appreciate both these films...As for the cast, it is a work of genius. There are so many angles that could be debated here!

Still, this is one of the most unforgettable films to me. Every main personality is handsome and pretty, wealthy but never deteriorated, and loves and respects each other. Yes, people may say it is unrealistic, but I wish such people actually exist, or I say we can enjoy such unrealistic things only in movies.Brad Pitt is a good actor, moreover a big star. He has challenged many characters in a variety of films; he had already shown us his acting talent in his early days, such as in Se7en(1995) and Twelve Monkeys(1995), he was even violent and brutal in Fight Club(1999) and Snatch (2000), and he was a star out of stars in Ocean's Eleven(2001), Ocean's Twelve(2004), and Ocean's Thirteen(2007). But I believe he is the most powerful when he acts such a perfectly handsome man as in this Joe Black or The Curious Case of Benjamin Button(2008). Whether Brad Pitt himself likes this role of Joe Black or not, I think only Brad Pitt could perform it.There was also one of the most beautiful scenes in the film history. After Susan Parrish (Claire Forlani) says good-bye to a young man (Brad Pitt) she got acquainted with and enjoyably chatted with in the coffee shop, they care about each other; when Susan watches the man on his back walking away, he does not turn his face; and when the man watches Susan on her back walking away, she does not turn her face; they repeatedly do so until Susan hesitantly turns left and disappears. They are rather reserved and hesitant, though they like each other. This scene is really excellent and unforgettable with the beautiful sound track music.William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) is a successful media tycoon, but sensible and even brave to face to his destiny to die, above all, a loving person.

Yes, gentleman soldiers. Many classic WWII films are usually seen with plenty of evil nazi pigs, Germans speaking English with German accent and patriotic atmosphere backing the allied forces towards the victorious end. There are very little of those features here.If you weren't aware of the existence of the WWII, watching this film, in many points you couldn't actually distinguish who the two counterparts fighting each other are. Everybody speaks English in different accents, not just German, British or American accents as may be in many cases. The German colonel Steiner speaks fluent English with an English accent, an Irishman is on the German side fighting the English, etc.. Also, the German soldiers are not demonised but seen equally human and humane as the English villagers and the American troops. The events are viewed more from the Germans' side than of the English and the Americans. These equalising features separate the film's events from the history in the way that in the end it's merely a story about some military forces that invade some town in a mission to kidnap a head of some state. The film concentrates on individual relationships, on duty, greater good and betrayal.The war in this film has no terrors. Soldiers of both sides obey the rules of proper warfare and they respect each other. There are no bads in this film, only goods. It seems as if they were playing a game. Everybody does what they are supposed and expected to do, even when it results in giving away one's life. Player's on both sides do what is right based on their role in the war game.All this together, the film is a light war story. It also has an even lighter love story on the side. Reality and authenticity are not an issue. Acting is good, the sights are beautiful and the plot advances steadily. The film is entertaining and easy to watch. Of course, if you have read your history books, you can also predict the outcome of the Germans' plan, but it doesn't matter. The Eagle Has Landed could be described as the Ocean's Eleven in war. A group of gentlemen challenging another group of gentlemen. Only in this case, they are not robbing a casino, they are robbing a PM. All the same, the general attitude in the film feels similar.

I will watch them as soon as possible), better said almost at the very end of this impressive masterpiece of Costa-Gavras (of course the masterpiece thing was said correctly) we have like a partial victory. One of the characters, of the ones we were with during the entire film, feels the partial victory (they're all indicted, even the general. The judge didn't back down) and overreacts, thinking that from that moment everything was going to change, it's a real revolution, the government will fall and extremists will be wiped out. Election will be a landslide. The issue here is that this character really doesn't overreacts since he just witnessed that justice really exists, that there is still the enough courage in some people to say the truth. Before going on in order to write that after all this character's reaction will be seen as an overreaction or as a moment in which this character saw the world as a place out of the perfect fairy tale I will write a couple of more things. First, who is that mentioned character? Well he is one of the closest persons of the doctor (a deputy played by Yves Montand) and that means he is part of the opposition, that means he will be part of the pacifist meeting that will be the place of a tragedy, of acts of violence. This character I'm writing about is not, on the contrary of what you may be thinking fellow reader, a character that appears a lot in the film. Z is a film that creates lots of possibilities for subplots, for instance we have one character that is a journalist (and that is played in a really superb way by Jacques Perrin) and is a classic situation this guy is covering the pacifist meeting because of his colleague, he is there sort of wanting to be in other place (more specific to be covering a big play), not really caring about the stuff that's going on (there are many persons there that are not quite supporting the doctor and his people) but he will witness in flesh and blood the abuse, the power of those that just follow orders, of those that see as the enemy the people like the doctor. Like I said, this is like a classic situation so of course this journalist will be more interested, he will want to know the truth behind the accident that by the end of the night leaved the doctor at a hospital with a not very positive diagnostic. What I loved about this is that this journalist goes on with his typical story but we see him not as much as we may have thought we were going to, there is not unnecessary storytelling. And the film is rich of minor but nevertheless very important characters that deliver truly impressive moments (the acting is truly top-notch), take the doctor's wife (I loved that scene with her not listening at all the things the guilty ones tell her just for commitment as well as the use of flashbacks), the mentioned journalist, the witness that loves football and that wants to see his face on the paper or the man who did the very last stage of the big job, all of them are nothing less than fascinating to watch. The film takes just the perfect and no more time for all of its, fascinating, characters. Jean-Louis Trintignant plays the examining magistrate. He is like the main character of the film, the sort of neutral one just doing his job as good as possible. But we will have the point where the magistrate will be seen as part of the opposition, for the fairest reasons, I mean is still the magistrate doing his job as good as possible but nevertheless starting to be more than just a little menace for the ones with real power, for the ones that ban things. The magistrate is the representation of courage, it should, it should be seen as a normal thing but due to the certain circumstances what the magistrate do is seen as a real act of bravery and of course is an act to celebrate, is the beginning of the end for some that of course deserves that end, it's all ready, everybody knows the good guys won, only better things will come but...An important piece of film you really must see. 10 out of 10...

Like I said, this is like a classic situation so of course this journalist will be more interested, he will want to know the truth behind the accident that by the end of the night leaved the doctor at a hospital with a not very positive diagnostic. What I loved about this is that this journalist goes on with his typical story but we see him not as much as we may have thought we were going to, there is not unnecessary storytelling. And the film is rich of minor but nevertheless very important characters that deliver truly impressive moments (the acting is truly top-notch), take the doctor's wife (I loved that scene with her not listening at all the things the guilty ones tell her just for commitment as well as the use of flashbacks), the mentioned journalist, the witness that loves football and that wants to see his face on the paper or the man who did the very last stage of the big job, all of them are nothing less than fascinating to watch. The film takes just the perfect and no more time for all of its, fascinating, characters. Jean-Louis Trintignant plays the examining magistrate. He is like the main character of the film, the sort of neutral one just doing his job as good as possible. But we will have the point where the magistrate will be seen as part of the opposition, for the fairest reasons, I mean is still the magistrate doing his job as good as possible but nevertheless starting to be more than just a little menace for the ones with real power, for the ones that ban things. The magistrate is the representation of courage, it should, it should be seen as a normal thing but due to the certain circumstances what the magistrate do is seen as a real act of bravery and of course is an act to celebrate, is the beginning of the end for some that of course deserves that end, it's all ready, everybody knows the good guys won, only better things will come but...An important piece of film you really must see. 10 out of 10...

I will watch them as soon as possible), better said almost at the very end of this impressive masterpiece of Costa-Gavras (of course the masterpiece thing was said correctly) we have like a partial victory. One of the characters, of the ones we were with during the entire film, feels the partial victory (they're all indicted, even the general. The judge didn't back down) and overreacts, thinking that from that moment everything was going to change, it's a real revolution, the government will fall and extremists will be wiped out. Election will be a landslide. The issue here is that this character really doesn't overreacts since he just witnessed that justice really exists, that there is still the enough courage in some people to say the truth. Before going on in order to write that after all this character's reaction will be seen as an overreaction or as a moment in which this character saw the world as a place out of the perfect fairy tale I will write a couple of more things. First, who is that mentioned character? Well he is one of the closest persons of the doctor (a deputy played by Yves Montand) and that means he is part of the opposition, that means he will be part of the pacifist meeting that will be the place of a tragedy, of acts of violence. This character I'm writing about is not, on the contrary of what you may be thinking fellow reader, a character that appears a lot in the film.

Hollywood's star system may have died a death as the face of American cinema slowly shifted onto different levels, but it seems people just cannot get enough of this one hundred minute Humphrey Bogart vehicle that allows people to hark back to a time when set-shot, scuzzy, black and white film noirs were the mainstay for the cinematic crowd out for that genre; and people could see their acting heroes do what ever one-dimensional, 'tough guy' act it was that they did.A pet-dislike with The Maltese Falcon, although others will say it's all part of its genius, that I have is its low-key and minute look at a period in each of its character's lives. The film's item that springboards everyone into action is a small falcon statue, made by the Maltese for the Spanish in the 1500s, worth millions of dollars and is rumoured to be floating around the San Fransisco area circa 1941 when the film was set and produced. The tracking of the statue and the long history it carries is immense, rich and actually quite interesting; and yet The Maltese Falcon as a stand-alone film is only a brief glance into the lives of a handful of people; all of them squabbling with one another as they struggle with the finding of it. The film is an exercise in narrative; it revels in its labyrinth of a plot that doesn't really hold weight for its runtime. After an hour, we are ready for it to end; I failed to immerse myself in the lives of these people; I failed to connect with any of the predicaments and most of the film is a mundane, ponderous and somewhat daft passage of searching, talking, friendships, double crosses and make-ups.The film actually begins with a murder; a murder of a certain individual who is linked to the chief protagonist Sam Spade (Bogart) in the sense they were partners together in a private investigation firm. I always approach a film that has, in what is practically its first scene, a murder of someone, with a degree of trepidation. When a film begins as abruptly as this, it can use that killing on the thirty second or so mark as a reason to deconstruct why it was the perpetrator did what he or she did, as well as document the downfall of the victim in equal measure &#x96; did they deserve it?; What did they do wrong?; Who were they? There's a wonderful moment in 1990's Goodfellas when the film catches up on itself following its opening scene which is a brutal stabbing and shooting of another gangster. We are thrust into the forefront by way of the director's shock tactics, and maybe we don't like it all that much. What follows is a documenting of one of the abettors and a scene much later on in which it becomes obvious who the victim was and why he had that happen to him.The Maltese Falcon carries none of that heart. The film is, in truth, a really soulless exercise; a film that has someone killed in what is a tragic waste of human life, and then just jogs on with everything else it wants to deal with in a casual and uninteresting fashion. Is the statue around? Who will end up with it? Who killed that guy we had zero affinity with in the opening? The film shoots along at a rapid old pace and yet is sophomoric in its story telling. It's a complete waste of everyone's time; characters and audience alike &#x96; but hey, we get to see Bogart spit some one-liners and escape to the world of 'noir' for a hundred minutes; so who cares, right? There is that consistent ideology amongst critics, theorists and audiences alike linked to genre cinema, or 'genre film-making'; the ideation that if a certain number of boxes are ticked within certain genres, it garners a passing grade. The Maltese Falcon may well be one of the best genre pieces ever produced, what with its manipulation of light; its use of shadows; the desirable blonde who perhaps isn't all she seems; the downtrodden detective; the hard-minded cops that observe the lead tread between what's criminal and what's legal as well as the gruff voice-overs. In this regard, The Maltese Falcon is total noir; it is a less-than fascinating example of style over a substantial development of its two-bit characters and utter bore of a narrative. Perhaps it did set a trend for how noir was to be explored on screen; in that case, The Maltese Falcon is the filmic equivalent of an essay on the conventions of noir, as penned by John Huston - nothing more.It's not that I hate The Maltese Falcon, it's that I find it frustratingly turgid and inconsistent; characters will flick from liking one another to being one another's enemies, at one point a character even refers to Bogart as 'one of the wildest, most unpredictable persons I've ever known' in what comes across as a kind of self-aware line detailing the sporadic and inconsistent allegiances. Given the fondness I have for both the film and neo noir genres, not particularly taking to this might be the equivalent of a horror fanatic evoking a lukewarm reaction to Hitchcock's Psycho. The endless chasing and nattering on of this statue so steeped in history wears out its welcome as Bogart attempts to crack why his partner was killed so early on. It means 'who?' and 'why?' accompany, but do not compliment, 'where?' the falcon is. As an exercise in genre and laying out the ground rules, the film is somewhat appealing but it doesn't deliver for me.

When I was obsessed with the film as a child, I loved it mostly because of the dinosaurs. Looking back on the movie as an adult, I think I like it even more than I did before because now I see the realism that Spielberg was challenging his special effects wizards to create and I'm not talking strictly about how convincing the CGI and animatronic animals are.Jurassic Park is based on a Michael Crichton techno-thriller of the same name, one of my favorite books. As in the book, scientists are invited to inspect and become the first visitors to a wealthy entrepreneur's island resort, where he is exhibiting exotic animals. Upon arriving at the island, the scientists and skeptics soon discover that the park is populated with genetically engineered dinosaurs separated from the visitors by electric fences. When the park loses power and the dinosaurs break free, the scientists soon find themselves running from the creatures they've been studying, but all the while awing the majesty of these fabulous animals.In my introduction, I said the primary reason why I admire Jurassic Park so much now is because of the way Spielberg portrayed the dinosaurs. And again, I'm not congratulating the team just because the dinosaurs look realistic. Realistic special effects are a package order in Hollywood. The team was challenged at the time, but they were destined to succeed. No, what I am talking about is the way the dinosaurs are represented. In previous dinosaurs movies, dinosaurs were either scary or awesome, but never both. They were either objects of terror or monoliths of majesty. Here, Spielberg decided to work the same magic he had done with the aliens in Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and make the dinosaurs behave not as characters in a monster picture, but as real animals. One of the opening shots displays the dinosaurs in full-view in broad daylight and the characters as well as the audience are overwhelmed by the sense of awe and majesty and wonder that would be so natural if dinosaurs really did walk the earth again. And even the carnivorous dinosaurs have their own sense of awe, finding ways to scare the audience as well as amaze them.And that, I think, is the real power of the first Jurassic Park film. In the two sequels, the dinosaurs were degenerated down into playing the standard monsters on the loose and the sense of majesty was more or less swept away. But the first film stands out not only as a breakthrough in special effects, but because it shows Spielberg utilizing the two techniques on the audience that made him a revolutionary and significant filmmaker thrills and awe. And Jurassic Park has a terrific blend of both.

When I was obsessed with the film as a child, I loved it mostly because of the dinosaurs. Looking back on the movie as an adult, I think I like it even more than I did before because now I see the realism that Spielberg was challenging his special effects wizards to create and I'm not talking strictly about how convincing the CGI and animatronic animals are.Jurassic Park is based on a Michael Crichton techno-thriller of the same name, one of my favorite books. As in the book, scientists are invited to inspect and become the first visitors to a wealthy entrepreneur's island resort, where he is exhibiting exotic animals. Upon arriving at the island, the scientists and skeptics soon discover that the park is populated with genetically engineered dinosaurs separated from the visitors by electric fences. When the park loses power and the dinosaurs break free, the scientists soon find themselves running from the creatures they've been studying, but all the while awing the majesty of these fabulous animals.In my introduction, I said the primary reason why I admire Jurassic Park so much now is because of the way Spielberg portrayed the dinosaurs.

It's your present condition and mood, together with your past experiences that influence the way it gets to you in this case, with Thelma & Louise, the original strong emotion I felt when I first saw it many years ago, was strengthened by the vivid remembrance of an amazing on the road journey, I have recently made with a friend, of those infinite roads leading to nowhere, those desolate lands, those squalid motels and houses appearing as ghosts in the middle of nothing, stirring a sense of deep nostalgia, but at the same time making the movie more intense and vivid. The two protagonists,Thelma and Louise, represent the best possible existing form of friendship between two women, because not stained, as it often is in real life, by the cancer of human feelings, envy their condition gets growingly more dangerous and desperate but their deep solidarity remains untouched by external events they feel, think and act as if they were one body and one soul. Their story and inner struggles penetrate in the viewer's perspective as if we were there, driving with them, as if we could feel that wide range of sensations, from freedom, to fear, from joy to desperation, a whole category of human feelings concentrated in a single journey, and the emotional impact is truly intense. The scenery is, obviously, breathtaking those infinite spaces, that for Europeans are so unconceivable, cannot leave you without a sense of the smallness of human beings towards the absolute and infiniteness of the universe, they may either amplify your inner struggles, or help you downsize them, but in either cases they cannot leave you untouched. Gena Davis and Susan Sarandon are simply superb, magnetically paired, extraordinarily over the top I think women could learn much from them about the real significance of female friendship and solidarity. A must see movie.
