[{"date":"11 February 2002","score":"","review":"  Thoroughly enjoyable teen comedy about a group of totally different high school students together in one mad party. This little gem went unnoticed in the UK without a cinema release and I managed to pick it up on video for the reason, like so many other people (probably all males anyway!!) that Jennifer Love Hewitt was in it. Hewitt is not the star here though as she only fleets in and out of the story. Ethan Embry (Empire Records) plays a caring, if a little gullible, guy who has fancied the pants off the schools most popular girl (Hewitt) all though school and he sees this party as an ideal chance to tell her, hearing that she has split from her `jock' boyfriend (Peter Facinelli &#150; Honest). That is the main storyline, although there are many others involving different characters. Seth Green (Austin Powers) is superb as the white boy who thinks he's a `gangsta from the hood' Another storyline, and probably my favourite, involves 2 geeks who desperately want to get into the party, and the different things they try to do so. Good cast, stand out - Lauren Ambrose, who I have never seen in anything previously. Jerry O'Connell (Joe's Apartment), Melissa Joan Hart (Sabrina the teenage witch) and Jenna Elfman (Dhama and Greg) all appear unbilled.

I read the book a long time ago, and this is a dumbed-down version of a great story.  There are no surprises, and the climax is painfully weak, yet I wanted to like it so badly that I forgave a lot.  For instance - The Teeth.  In the first act, all the good people had nice white perfect teeth (exactly what you would expect to see several hundred years ago).  All the bad people had horrible rotting teeth.  Fine. BUT, someone please tell me how, the more we were supposed to hate Mondego, the worse his teeth became, and how, the more we were supposed to love Dantes, who after spending 13 years in solitary confinement, managed to end up with beautiful wonderful teeth??  I realize I am nit-picking, but the talent of Guy Pearce is all but wasted in his role.  HE should have played Dantes (yes, he can be gorgeous) and perhaps Gary Oldman could\/should have played Montego.That said, I will add that I thought the sets and cinematography were truly inspired, and would recommend this film as 'fine, Hollywood, wonderful entertainment.'

What makes it all the more appalling is the fact that the director, Joe Roth, is a studio head and that the performers include some of the biggest names in Hollywood (including the biggest female name, Julia Roberts) and still the air of falseness is overwhelming. Roberts plays the gofer\/sister of a petulant star and much of her scenes are in an unconvincing fat suit designed to create a sympathy the actress herself clearly doesn't believe in. (Roberts has regressed from her `Erin Brockovich' brilliance back to her whiny, self-pitying `Notting Hill' days, a very dismaying fact given her potential.) Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the selfish actress forced to seemingly reconcile with her star husband (John Cusack, badly miscast) at a press junket for a movie not yet complete. Roberts and Cusack discover each other (again, as flashbacks tell us) while the publicist assigned to divert everyone's attention from the film (Billy Crystal) tries to pump up the false reconciliation. It's a mess--unfunny and tedious with one incredulous moment after another. When you get to the climax, the film itself, thoroughly unbelievable as presented by its reclusive auteur (Christopher Walken, perhaps the only bright spot), you realize just how misbegotten the entire effort was, a fun bit of self-congratulation meant to indulge the stars and their honcho director. The fact that Crystal, normally a very intelligent writer, co-authored the horrible script (along with Peter Tolan) leaves you to wonder what came over these people. A must to avoid.
