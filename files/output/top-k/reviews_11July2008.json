[{"date":"11 July 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This computer animated feature from Disney came out in 2000, but I don't think I ever heard of it until last year. I rented it to watch for the first time about fourteen months ago, and by that point, I had been impressed by a good number of computer animated features, blown away by some, so I was hoping to find some good entertainment value in Dinosaur. However, I didn't really find it too entertaining during my first viewing, and it didn't leave me with the clearest memory I've ever had of a movie. A couple days ago, I rented it again, and thought maybe it would be better this time, but while it may have been just very SLIGHTLY better, it was still somewhat of a disappointment.A mother Iguanodon watches over her eggs, but unfortunately, after an attack, only one of them survives. This one egg is stolen and lost by a number of dinosaurs, but eventually ends up on an island inhabited by lemurs. Here, the egg soon hatches, and the baby Iguanodon comes out. At first, Yar, the elder lemur, is afraid that the dinosaur will become a dangerous predator to them when he grows up, but soon agrees to keep him. So, the dinosaur is named Aladar and raised by the lemurs on that island, and fortunately doesn't turn out to be a threat to them after all. However, a different threat awaits this island's inhabitants... a meteor shower! After this meteor shower hits, their island is destroyed, but Aladar manages to rescue his lemur family and take them across the water on his back. Searching for a new place to live, they soon join a herd of dinosaurs who have survived the meteor shower and are headed for the breeding grounds, but with predators, lack of water, and an oppressive leader, getting to their destination will be a challenge, and since Aladar was raised differently than the others in the herd, he may have trouble fitting in! The animation in this film is widely praised, and I'm certainly not complaining about that. The film sometimes uses live action backgrounds behind the realistic looking computer animated characters, which works. However, the amazing animation isn't enough to hide the movie's problems. I personally found quite a bit of it fairly boring. It may often get tedious (I was definitely bored at times), and most the characters, if not all of them, don't really stand out as very memorable. Also, while I did find some parts mildly amusing, I didn't usually find a lot of humour, and good humour is something I like to see in animated family movies. I did find some parts exciting, especially towards the end of the movie, with maybe some remotely touching moments as well, and the animation and music sometimes helped. I also have a clearer memory of it now that I've seen it a second time. Still, the film was a tad disappointing, and not one I would want to watch over and over again.After seeing Dinosaur twice, I still think that overall, it's just slightly above average, definitely not one of Disney's gems. I guess since this is a family movie, I should mention that there are some rather violent dinosaur fighting sequences, which some may criticize it for. Well, I guess that's why it's rated PG, and at least there's no blood in these sequences. That aside, while the appeal of this 2000 Disney flick isn't as wide as that of many other computer animated features (which I can understand), it seems that quite a few people like it more than I do, and even I think it's far from terrible, so saying avoid it like the plague would be a bit harsh, but I wouldn't expect it to be one of the computer animated classics, despite its memorably stunning animation, which seems to be what it's most widely praised for.

The film hews fairly closely to its source material, with some important differences, and really is quite the exemplar of modern-day animation arts. In it, we are introduced to James Henry Trotter, an orphaned boy whose miserable existence with his two witchlike aunts takes a decided turn for the better when a mysterious old man gives him a bagful of magical green crystals. These crystals cause the previously barren peach tree in his front yard to grow the titular giant fruit, and James soon meets, inside the stone of the fruit, six new friends, giants all a grasshopper, a spider, an earthworm, a glowworm, a ladybug and a centipede (the book's silkworm character, for some reason, has been omitted). The seven make a hazardous trans-Atlantic journey to NYC aboard the peach, a journey that tests the mettle of each of the team indeed. The film differs from Dahl's book in that the journey to NYC is a goal, rather than a happy accident. The film also tones down the book's violence (James' aunts are not killed in the film), turns the shark into some kind of killer robot, and, most unwisely, drops the entire sequence with the Cloud Men in favor of a haunted pirate ship not at all present in Dahl's text. The nature of the rhino that ate James' parents is also, strangely, much altered. The filmmakers have added some musical numbers to the mix, and although Randy Newman's charms are usually lost on me, I found his five contributions here to be quite entertaining. The picture blends live action, stop-motion animation and what looks to be (in James' dream) animated collages seamlessly and effectively, and the whole production really is something of a technical marvel. Despite the changes, this is one very winning entertainment indeed.

While it skips over a lot of the book, the scenes that are included are quite similar to their counterparts in the book. It is fun to see the scenes from the book come to life, and they mostly looked very similar to what I had in my head. The film is closer to the source material than Peter Jackson's trilogy, but is still much worse in my opinion.It lacks heart. The characters don't show any major development, and it is hard to identify with or like any of them. John Hurt does a good job as the voice of Aragorn, but sadly that's not enough to make up for the animators and writers portrayal of him. The characters aren't introduced well enough; Aragorn's introduction is pretty much I am Aragorn, a friend of Gandalf's and not much more is disclosed about him.Another major problem is the animation. Ralph Bakshi uses this technique called 'rotoscoping', which I wont go into very much depth on, partially because I don't know exactly what it is or how it is made. Google it if you're curious. Anyway, the result of this technique is that at many points in the film, where characters have been 'rotoscoped', the characters look like a cross between live action people and cartoons, a very weird, displeasing effect. The orcs and Nazgul just look like black blobs with eyes during the scenes where they are rotoscoped. Apart from the rotoscoping, the animation is very incontinuous. Pippin's hair changes colour during the Mines of Moria scene, and characters faces shift around in an ungodly way. The backgrounds are also bad in my opinion. The backgrounds are clearly painted while the characters on them are cartoons which do not look realistic against the backgrounds.Next problem is the pacing. Many times during the film a character will say something and the 'camera' (although there are no cameras when making cartoons you know what I mean) will linger on the characters face for 3 seconds after they've finished talking. 3 seconds of the character just standing there, looking, with nothing special taking place. Also, the 'Flight to the Ford' scene is disastrous. Just a lot of Frodo on a horse pacing back and forth in front of Nazgul who aren't attacking for some reason.I think this film is, however, underrated. After you have seen the Rankin\/Bass version of 'The Return of the King', you will see how bad an adaptation of 'Lord of the Rings' can be, and you will appreciate this attempt more, and be able to see that they did an alright job of it.To recap, I DO recommend this to people who have read 'Lord of the Rings', just for the novelty of seeing scenes from the book interpreted by Bakshi. I even recommend people who have not read the books but have seen Jackson's trilogy to watch this, for the same novelty.If you are new to the 'Lord of the Rings' phenomenon, read the books, or at least see Peter Jackson's trilogy. You will not be able to understand this film without some prior knowledge of the story.PS I do not recommend ANYONE to see the Rankin\/Bass version of 'Return of the King'.

The film itself is undoubtedly outstanding in its artistic individuality, with Jeunet and Caro creating a masterpiece which is praised by film critics and viewers alike.Throughout the film the lavish use of colour and various shot types are what make the film such a wonder to watch. Jeunet uses alternative camera angles to create a somewhat obscure feeling whilst watching. The use of angles is especially what makes us feel like we are not only watching a movie but that we are becoming part of Jeunet and Caro's wondrous creation.The humour is somewhat bizarre but is still presented to us in a way which can be appreciated audiences; especially with Aurores various attempts at suicide and the distinguishing ways in which characters are filmed and presented. The overall plot itself contains some form of humour; boy meets girl and girl's father tries to use him for meat, this all being set in an apocalyptic future. To me that does not sound like a typical romantic comedy, giving the film an element of (as I have already stated) individuality but it also makes it quite charming.The overall film itself is very unconventional, especially with all the cinematic stylistic techniques and the individual touches added by the directors.

His voice is his own, and whether working for a studio or on more independent terms it's always a Joint. Is this always a marker of him hitting it out of the park every time? Not really. As if he was Jean-Luc Godard among the black filmmaker's circle, when he's on fire he's surely hot, and when he's not it's f***ing horrifying to see him fail. Bamboozled is one of those latter times, and it's so flawed in so many ways that it's a wonder that some of the good ideas come through in the mid-section. It's the kind of movie where one may like it more for what it could have been rather than what it is.Bamboozled is meant to be, as Lee's character Delacroix (Damon Wayans) points out more than once both to the audience in dictionary definition and layman's terms, a satire. Thanks for the reminder, Spike! This is all well and good, but it's ultimately misguided and without a really solid comic viewpoint.

They really cut corners on this one For example, in the first movie, the kids seem to be pretty good at this karate stuff. You have to kind of suspend your disbelief when the youngest attacks anyone, because you can just see him getting picked up by the scruff of the neck and hung up to dry until the fight is over. But it's a kids' film so that's not really a spoiler. And there is a lot of Home Alone-type stealth-fighting on the kids' side to help even things out. At the time, I saw the original actors from 3 Ninjas on the Tonight Show and they seemed to really know karate, and were pretty charming for kid actors.By contrast, in this last abomination, you can see in the fight scenes that there is no contact, and frequently there is cheap, obvious, camera speeding up to make it look like a real fight, not choreography. The littlest one, who is even younger than he was in any of the other movies, (there are all new actors for the kids in this movie, a big mistake, and what's up with the mullet\/ponytail on Colt? Even knowing karate he's going to get his ass kicked with that haircut! I'm gay but that look's too faggy for me. I mean, really! Butch it up a little, will ya?) In a good kids' movie there is something for the adults, too. But this movie doesn't really have much for the kids. Bad acting by Hulk Hogan and the kids, bad, bad, bad writing and directing, the earlier mentioned fake fight scenes (maybe these kids could take on an adult who didn't know karate, but for them to beat an adult NINJA, just because they have been trained by a cliché-spouting grandfather, and have an FBI agent father? I don't think so. And amusement park rides aren't designed so they can be stopped upside-down and remotely release the passengers, which is the so-called terrorists plan. It's called safety engineering, meaning, there is no situation where you would WANT to be able to do that, so you don't design your system to BE ABLE TO DO THAT! Of course, then you don't have a movie, if you can't do that. Of course, you would have to GET CLEVERER WRITERS! There's a few good lines from Loni Anderson and Jim Varney, although they both come across as somewhat incompetent. Can't have real, know-your-stuff terrorists around to scare the kiddies, now, can we? Guess not.As it happened, this movie came to North Carolina Cable TV around the same time I saw my first episode of the Middleman TV series, which happened to be the one about aliens hiding on earth disguised as people addicted to plastic surgery. When I first saw Loni Anderson, with her artificially plumped lips, probable-cheek-implants, probable-face-lift, probable-Botox, probable-etc., I first thought she had the same makeup as the aliens did in the Middleman episode. Then I realized that this was how she really looked. Scary. Probably too scary for a kids' movie. I know it was for me and I'm near 50.Summary For a good karate movie, see the first 3 Ninjas movie, or possibly the next two. Skip this bomb. Also the Karate Kid is good, esp. the first one (see a pattern here?) Someone tried to squeeze the last dime out of the 3 Ninjas franchise; hopefully it is completely dead now. You know how these things can come back to life in Hollywood... (cue scary music...)

They really cut corners on this one For example, in the first movie, the kids seem to be pretty good at this karate stuff. You have to kind of suspend your disbelief when the youngest attacks anyone, because you can just see him getting picked up by the scruff of the neck and hung up to dry until the fight is over. But it's a kids' film so that's not really a spoiler. And there is a lot of Home Alone-type stealth-fighting on the kids' side to help even things out. At the time, I saw the original actors from 3 Ninjas on the Tonight Show and they seemed to really know karate, and were pretty charming for kid actors.By contrast, in this last abomination, you can see in the fight scenes that there is no contact, and frequently there is cheap, obvious, camera speeding up to make it look like a real fight, not choreography. The littlest one, who is even younger than he was in any of the other movies, (there are all new actors for the kids in this movie, a big mistake, and what's up with the mullet\/ponytail on Colt? Even knowing karate he's going to get his ass kicked with that haircut! I'm gay but that look's too faggy for me. I mean, really! Butch it up a little, will ya?) In a good kids' movie there is something for the adults, too. But this movie doesn't really have much for the kids. Bad acting by Hulk Hogan and the kids, bad, bad, bad writing and directing, the earlier mentioned fake fight scenes (maybe these kids could take on an adult who didn't know karate, but for them to beat an adult NINJA, just because they have been trained by a cliché-spouting grandfather, and have an FBI agent father? I don't think so. And amusement park rides aren't designed so they can be stopped upside-down and remotely release the passengers, which is the so-called terrorists plan.

This time around it takes place at Sea World, and the main characters are the sons of the previous film's hero, Martin Brody. After several people are killed by a shark, the baby is accidentally captured, being mistaken for the culprit. Things take an exciting turn, when the culprit shark arrives to find it's baby and have a bite to eat. It's actually amazing that anybody in their right mind would be willing to take a risk making another Jaws movie, but I'm sure the 3-D effects helped it out a little. I'll admit that the cinematography was pretty nice in some spots, and the music could be pretty exciting, but it isn't as scary or as suspenseful as the incredible previous films. The acting in this movie is abysmal with a few exceptions, Dennis Quaid was okay as the hero, Louis Gossett Jr. helped to keep the movie afloat, no pun intended. And Lea Thompson wasn't all that bad either, she's mostly there for eye candy but whatever. The other actors were pretty lame, including the pompous Australian character who becomes dinner for the shark. The special effects can't even save the movie though, they are seriously some of the worst I have ever seen. There are several cheesy shots that were obviously for the three dimensional magic that simply doesn't exist without the glasses and the various super imposed images are extremely laughable, at one point you can actually see part of the little submarine get eaten up by the blue screen. The most gruesome scene in the movie is when despite his dull death scene, the shark's first victim's corpse floats in front of a glass tunnel and scaring everyone to death. It was funny when the corpse is right against the glass wall, right in front of a teenage girl, who is not only screaming in utter terror, but is pressed against the glass. I laughed so hard during this insanely goofy scene. On the other hand, it was gross seeing the corpse laid out on a table completely skinless from the neck down, and crabs crawling out of his mouth, pretty cool. I'm sure it must have been somewhat entertaining to see this movie in it's original cheesy 3-D glory, it's pretty horrible without it.The scene where the shark busts through glass and and floods a control room is unforgettable. The super imposed shark is motionlessly floating toward the camera, and there are various shots of the characters inside in slow motion. I watched this with my mom and she thought something was wrong with the video, she didn't realize it was for dramatic effect until halfway through the scene. When the shark busts through the glass, some glass shatters and falls, the shark is still floating there completely still. This can be excused thanks to the shark's death scene, which is still tainted by effects that would only be slightly cool in 3-D. Bottom line, this is mediocre movie and can only be fun because it's so awful that it's funny. The better parts of the movie, is the fast paced second half, Dennis Quaid, Louis Gossett Jr. and seeing Lea Thompson in a swimsuit, which was probably the saving grace of the movie. I don't really recommend this movie, but if you're just that curious to see how low the series was falling then knock yourself out. The first and original movie was a masterpiece that never needed a sequel, the second one was still pretty good, this one bites and bears no resemblance to anything the previous ones offered, but then there's a fourth one.

The first time I'd seen Reservoir Dogs was after a wave of Tarantino enthusiasm having watched and loved Pulp Fiction, a film released two years after this little masterpiece. But I was disappointed; I felt like I hadn't been taken through the roller-coaster ride of emotions; laughs and thrills that I had been with Pulp Fiction, a few months prior. But looking back and after many further viewings, Reservoir Dogs has snuck up on me because I now value it a little higher than Pulp Fiction and bizarrely enough, I get more of an emotional kick out of this film then Tarantino's follow up.Perhaps it was my naivety in regards to independent film at the time that I didn't take to this after the first viewing, but any doubts towards this not being an excellent and spell-binding film have since been laid to rest. Reservoir Dogs is a film that delves into the past from the present, setting up several characters; situations and stories within flashbacks that all combine to deliver a hair-raising climax with plenty of other dramatic, some more gruesome than others, moments thrown in for good measure. Reservoir Dogs is at its very core, a brilliant and emotionally fuelled film that twists, turns, creates doubts and delivers on levels of artistic creativity, out and out action and stupendous dialogue without ever feeling like a gimmick.Some of my favourite scenes in the film rely on slow motion such as the German Shepard police dog barking in the cloakroom amongst the other officers and Cabot (Tierney) lighting up a cigarette as he gives his opinion on the false story, smoke flying up all around him as another voice-over kicks in. Then there are the scenes in the warehouse in which Steve Buscemi playing Mr. Pink and co-producer Harvey Keitel playing Mr. White deliver some fantastic performances aided with dialogue that sums up the situation, mentality and emotions running high given that scenario they find themselves in. But the film knows how to rope us in and juxtapose our feelings and emotions without ever feeling manipulative. Some examples of this is are at the very beginning when, after a quiet and relatively subtle breakfast conversation, Mr Orange (Roth) lies screaming and bloody in the back of a car &#150; something has gone wrong. There is also the incidence when Mr Blonde (Madsen), during that infamous 'ear' scene, leaves the action to go to his car in order to get a can of petrol. These juxtapositions and toying with the audience sums up not only the brilliance of being able to switch between scenarios but also highlights Tarantino's skill as a writer\/director.The truth is that any scene that takes place in the warehouse rendez-vous is just pure genius, whether it is dialogue between two or three people or the torture scene or the unforgettable climax. A diamond robbery has gone wrong and the immediate theory of an undercover cop crops up thanks to the quick thinking of Mr. Pink; the more outgoing and independent of the thieves. But this seed planted in the audiences mind is one of a few things we are to concentrate on throughout the duration. Twinned this, we get numerous flashbacks and, indeed, flashbacks within flashbacks that tell us a greater deal of information involving the heist and the characters past situations. But here several things work at once Nice Guy Eddie (Penn) arrives and maintains there is no 'rat', perhaps disbursing the theory of a traitor, challenging the audience to work it out. Mr. Blonde is established as someone who is just out of prison and his awkward situation involving parole officers and such doesn't faze him as he accepts the new job from his former employees of the heist. This creates a dangerous opinion of him in our minds, further emphasising the earlier opinion we had of him when it was established 'Blonde went crazy' and shot several people, including a young woman. It is an appetiser for what's to come, especially when he has a policeman at his mercy; but my favourite bit is when we learn he went to a drive-thru restaurant at a time of crisis and with a policeman in his boot.But these criminals in suits are not caricatures of mobsters from other crime\/heist films. Mr. Orange screams and squeals in agony after being shot thus expelling any 'tough-guy' stereotype we may have of these guys in this genre. It is later established to great effect that he is a very humble and humane person, with bigger fish to fry. Tarantino executes a film here with random flashes of violence such as the torture scene climax and Mr. Pink's breakaway flashback. He lands his pop culture dialogue with talk of Madonna; The Silver Surfer and likens Gene Tierney to 'The Thing'. It even transpires some of the guys enjoy Lee Marvin's work. Shot on a budget with the help of Harvey Keitel but written with a budget of a lot less in mind, Reservoir Dogs shocks but entertains; humours but does not glamorise and generally gives its viewer a kick every time they watch it.

Based on the classic fairy-tale as told by Charles Perrault, the film follows the trials and tribulations of Cinderella, a good girl who is mistreated by her evil stepmother and equally awful stepsisters. When a royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited (read the King wants to get the Prince to marry so he can have grandchildren), Cinderella is left at home whilst her stepmother takes her awful daughters with her. But there is a Fairy Godmother on hand, and if you don't know what happens next, then I would seriously want to know why.I think we can all admit that the story of Cinderella as it appears in Perrault's collection wouldn't be able to pad out a feature on its own, so whilst generally staying true to the story, the fairly incidental characters of the animals whom the Fairy Godmother uses to help get the title character to the ball become Cinderella's true sidekicks, much like how the roles of the fairies were later fleshed out in Sleeping Beauty, or how Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio went from a minor character into the role of mentor. Two of the mice, Jaq and Gus, act as the principal sidekicks, with their own nemesis being a purely invented character, the obnoxious family cat Lucifer. The animal antics intertwine generally with the main plot, and reflect the general theme of the struggle between oppressor and slave (the little mice, birds and barnyard animals live in squalor, whereas the manipulative and selfish Lucifer lives in luxury). The film does slow down a bit between the main introduction of the characters and before the stepsisters depart for the ball, but after this slowdown, the film really gets going again and surprisingly (since Cinderella is the most worn down story of all time, probably) ends up as one of the most involving and engaging of Disney stories. The stepmother is one of the most alarming of Disney villains due to her having a sense of reality. She doesn't use black magic like to get her way like the evil fairy Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty or the Queen in Snow White, but regardless subtly controls and manipulates people to horrific effect, including her own blatantly insecure daughters. In short, she uses people skills to a truly terrifying effect.The animation and art direction is lovely. All of the legendary Nine Old Men animated on this picture, and Mary Blair's colour styling and concept art (she also did concept art and colour styling for Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, The Three Caballeros and many many others) manage to wiggle their way on screen. The bold colours and whimsical, wavy designs are lovely, especially in the Fairy Godmother and ball scenes, where the characters often play against silhouettes of dark blues and violet. The staging feels theatrical and expressionistic, suiting the whimsical and romantic nature of the story adequately.Overall, Cinderella ranks as one of the best Disney fairy-tales and comes recommended to young and all. It embodies that uplifting philosophy so present in many Disney films - dreams really can come true.

Based on the classic fairy-tale as told by Charles Perrault, the film follows the trials and tribulations of Cinderella, a good girl who is mistreated by her evil stepmother and equally awful stepsisters. When a royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited (read the King wants to get the Prince to marry so he can have grandchildren), Cinderella is left at home whilst her stepmother takes her awful daughters with her. But there is a Fairy Godmother on hand, and if you don't know what happens next, then I would seriously want to know why.I think we can all admit that the story of Cinderella as it appears in Perrault's collection wouldn't be able to pad out a feature on its own, so whilst generally staying true to the story, the fairly incidental characters of the animals whom the Fairy Godmother uses to help get the title character to the ball become Cinderella's true sidekicks, much like how the roles of the fairies were later fleshed out in Sleeping Beauty, or how Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio went from a minor character into the role of mentor. Two of the mice, Jaq and Gus, act as the principal sidekicks, with their own nemesis being a purely invented character, the obnoxious family cat Lucifer.

Zanuck's epic story of the D-Day invasion of Normandy in 1944 boggles the mind with its scope and ambition. It's properly called Darryl F. Zanuck's movie because the cigar-chomping Goy from Wahoo, Nebraska, is the prime mover. Without him, and without the four-million-dollar infusion of his own financial blood, it would never have been made. Zanuck was just coming off a series of flops at the time (Satan Never Sleeps?) and this was his last big shot. He controlled everything. He inserted an important part for his then-girlfriend, Irene Demick, during the demise of his marriage. Not that this was anything but traditional in Hollywood then and now. Darryl's son, Richard, gave HIS paramour an important, if silent, part as Charlton Heston's girlfriend in Planet of the Apes. It's GOOD to be the producer. Anyway, it has to be Zanuck's movie because it's a vast ensemble piece with none of the forty-two stars being given more than a few minutes of screen time.There are no back stories at all. None of the characters, most of them based on real people drawn from Cornelius Ryan's blockbuster book, have wives or children. There are no flashbacks to anyone's happy boyhood, fishing barefoot from a pier. Nobody grew up in a dysfunctional family in the slums either. Nobody carries a picture of the girl back home.The Americans and Brits speak English, the French speak French, and the Germans speak German. This means subtitles, which in turn means that if it were produced today nobody under the age of thirty would enjoy seeing it, since MTV and Die Hard Forever and I Dismember Mamma have no subtitles. One can almost hear the complaints of the kids sitting around chugging energy drinks and squirming with the effort to look and read at the same time. Well, maybe that's a little harsh. I'll make an exception. There would be no squirming among the kids in any household that has a copy of The Origin of Species on one of its bookshelves.Aside from the expense and the massive logistical effort on display, it's not a bad movie. There are a few awkward moments in the script, true, such as when a solemn actor tells someone else, and the audience as well, that this is an important day and we should all try to remember it.And, thank God, no speeches about patriotism. These guys on both sides are dying. The nationalism is on display and doesn't need to be spelled out. There's a good deal of irony too. It tempers the obvious heroism. Some German soldiers come out of a bunker with their hands up, crying Bitte, bitte! and a GI shoots them all down, tips his helmet back, and muses, I wonder what 'Bitte, bitte' means. In Saving Private Ryan, any Germans trying to surrender are automatically exterminated without qualms. But The Longest Day is a kind of transitional film. Those produced during and immediately after the war pretty much demonized the enemy. Those coming later in the 1960s and afterward were usually more realistic in that they had more blood, and the enemy, although a nuisance, was sometimes humanized. But if the enemy weren't demonized, they weren't sympathized with in any way. They were offed matter-of-factly, the way Dirty Harry shot his adversaries. Just bodies.The British here are the kind who are jolly and brave and who hide their emotions carefully, as Richard Burton does. The Americans are good-natured complainers who practice seductive speeches in rudimentary French before jumping out of airplanes. The Germans are of two types -- the commanders who sit around sipping tea in palaces, and the men and junior officers at the front who frantically try to communicate with them while holding off an inexorable Allied force.There are concessions to commercialism, as there almost inevitably will be. Some incidents are depicted that never took place. Some mistakes are skipped over (the frenetic and pointless gyrations of the airplanes carrying the parachutists). And Irene Demick has a hair style straight out of 1962. Of course, our side wins. Our side always wins. That's why you will never see a movie called The Battle of the Java Sea or A Yank at Kasserine Pass.

The conflict between creative expression and advantageous commercial prospect corresponds with Piccoli's estrangement from his wife Brigitte Bardot, who becomes detached from Piccoli, in another one of Godard's pretentious scenes of internal indecision and external inertia between two lovers, after he leaves her alone with Palance, who is of course a hot shot convertible-driving playboy.Piccoli and Bardot's estrangement is obvious to us long before Godard is finished demonstrating it to us, continuing throughout his career to insult the intelligence of his audience by indulging in his own conscious effort to be different.Piccoli, Bardot, and Palance correspond to Odysseus, Penelope, and Poseidon, respectively. Oooooh!I just watched a French interview from 1964 of idolized New Wave filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard on YouTube. I've liked Breathless and Tout Va Bien, but I'm embittered towards him because his very snobbish and uninformed bite at Steven Spielberg, saying that Schindler's List was nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the Holocaust, which couldn't possibly be true because Spielberg famously was not paid for directing the movie. I watched the interview on YouTube because I was interested to see if my picture of Godard as an intellectual snob was founded, and it was, because anyone who watches this interview with the knowledge of his high-horsey criticism of very influential people like Spielberg and Jane Fonda can plainly see that he himself is guilty of selling out. The interview was for Contempt, which was made very popular at the time of its release because of the showcase of Brigitte Bardot's nude body. Godard answers the very admittedly prudish French interviewer's question about the scene by saying that he originally did not film those scenes with Bardot but that the American distributors said that in order to make the movie commercial, he would have to include a sex scene with her at the beginning, middle and end. Although he told the Americans that according to the story, it was impossible for her to have sex scenes with her at the middle and end, he submitted to annexing a sex scene at the beginning and nude scenes as substitutes for sex at the middle and end.Aside from my image of him as an intellectual snob being correct, as he seemingly needlessly references Cellini's Venus sculpture, for example, so that he can elusively flaunt his knowledge and intellect, we see that one of Godard's most famous, most talked-about, and most iconic sequences on film proves him a grandiose hypocrite.Godard also throws in a discussion of Dante's Inferno and Friedrich Hölderlin's poem, The Poet's Vocation. Normally, if there are elements of a film that I don't quite catch on to at first, I am patient for them to dawn on me. With films like Contempt, I feel contempt. There is a standard that the audience must reach. It looks down upon you. Whether it is fully comprehensible beyond its surface or not is irrelevant, because one no longer cares after the film tunes out from its audience and panders coldly to its own flight of fancy. Have many great films done that? Yes, but they are at least connected to the audience's reaction, whether bewildered, aghast, enlightened, intrigued, whatever.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"11 July 2008","score":"7 out of 19 people found the following review useful","review":" So Hollywood movie producer Jack Palance hires the extremely talented director Fritz Lang to direct a film adaptation of Homer's Odyssey. A cartoon stereotype of the overwhelmingly arrogant American, Palance is repulsed by and opposed to Lang's treatment of the material as an art film (having seen many films by Lang, I personally don't think he would've ever made the film Godard depicts him to have made) and hires a writer played by Michel Piccoli to revise the script. The conflict between creative expression and advantageous commercial prospect corresponds with Piccoli's estrangement from his wife Brigitte Bardot, who becomes detached from Piccoli, in another one of Godard's pretentious scenes of internal indecision and external inertia between two lovers, after he leaves her alone with Palance, who is of course a hot shot convertible-driving playboy.Piccoli and Bardot's estrangement is obvious to us long before Godard is finished demonstrating it to us, continuing throughout his career to insult the intelligence of his audience by indulging in his own conscious effort to be different.Piccoli, Bardot, and Palance correspond to Odysseus, Penelope, and Poseidon, respectively. Oooooh!I just watched a French interview from 1964 of idolized New Wave filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard on YouTube. I've liked Breathless and Tout Va Bien, but I'm embittered towards him because his very snobbish and uninformed bite at Steven Spielberg, saying that Schindler's List was nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the Holocaust, which couldn't possibly be true because Spielberg famously was not paid for directing the movie. I watched the interview on YouTube because I was interested to see if my picture of Godard as an intellectual snob was founded, and it was, because anyone who watches this interview with the knowledge of his high-horsey criticism of very influential people like Spielberg and Jane Fonda can plainly see that he himself is guilty of selling out. The interview was for Contempt, which was made very popular at the time of its release because of the showcase of Brigitte Bardot's nude body. Godard answers the very admittedly prudish French interviewer's question about the scene by saying that he originally did not film those scenes with Bardot but that the American distributors said that in order to make the movie commercial, he would have to include a sex scene with her at the beginning, middle and end. Although he told the Americans that according to the story, it was impossible for her to have sex scenes with her at the middle and end, he submitted to annexing a sex scene at the beginning and nude scenes as substitutes for sex at the middle and end.Aside from my image of him as an intellectual snob being correct, as he seemingly needlessly references Cellini's Venus sculpture, for example, so that he can elusively flaunt his knowledge and intellect, we see that one of Godard's most famous, most talked-about, and most iconic sequences on film proves him a grandiose hypocrite.Godard also throws in a discussion of Dante's Inferno and Friedrich Hölderlin's poem, The Poet's Vocation. Normally, if there are elements of a film that I don't quite catch on to at first, I am patient for them to dawn on me. With films like Contempt, I feel contempt. There is a standard that the audience must reach. It looks down upon you. Whether it is fully comprehensible beyond its surface or not is irrelevant, because one no longer cares after the film tunes out from its audience and panders coldly to its own flight of fancy. Have many great films done that? Yes, but they are at least connected to the audience's reaction, whether bewildered, aghast, enlightened, intrigued, whatever. Contempt couldn't care less about your reaction. Its title is perfect. It's like a brand name. You pick it up at the video store and that's what you get. Contempt.

It happened to be on Sky when I ended the night on my brother's sofa after a curry. It's one of those films I've always had half an interest in checking out (if only to see how Hitchcock got his only 18 certificate) but had just never been motivated enough to bother.Strangely, although I wasn't that impressed, it did keep me watching til the end (which I had no intention of getting to) and I had one of those bizarre epiphanies one only gets whilst belching p_issed on a sofa at 3am. I realised the early 70's looked like another world. I can watch an early 80's film (The Long Good Friday, set in the same city a decade later, is one of my favourite films) and it will still look like a world I recognise and remember- but in 1972 everything was either brown or orange.Seriously- sofas, lampshades, carpets, cars, jackets, beards. The lot. It was like the Beige Age. And it was this rather than the grim subject matter (suspiciously sideburned Jack The Ripper type rapes and strangles his way round Covent Garden) that gave Frenzy a pretty stale kind of atmosphere. You could almost smell the relentless fags and shots of whiskey almost every character had in almost every scene! Maybe it was the performances that dated it too though- most of the parts were played by British BBC sitcom actors (Hitch really did end things a long way from Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly in that New York apartment block he built) and the almost Sun- style way the characters seemed thrilled by the excitingly racy nature of the killings was very of it's time.Sex scandals and swearing (which every actor seems to be relishing being allowed to do) were obviously popular pastimes in 70's Britain.
