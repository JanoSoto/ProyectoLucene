This afternoon I had two hours off work, and thought I would relax in the sun and watch it. What a surprise.It starts with the photos of body parts, which are a little ambiguous, thighs, elbows, curves etc, and I thought, looks interesting. Well it stopped being interesting right there - I should have mowed the lawns! Silly innocuous girl, she kept saying she was nearly 21 but acted around 14, had her head in a bottle - presumably spent the last 4 years at college learning to hold her liquour - at her sister's wedding, in a rather odd bridesmaid's dress, met the man she was to spend the rest of the movie with. I have nothing against age gaps in relationship, although reality has taught me that sooner or later one of you is saggy and baggy and the other gets disillusioned. This guy, this Connie, with a woman's name, had a line as hackneyed and a style as old as the hills. Silly little girl has crush. Where he should have backed off from one who was so self-absorbed and totally boring, he didn't and we all suffered for it. The high spot for me was when she suggested that she look for a flat of her own a few months down the line and he had a tantrum and got well and truly hammered. The good looking older guy with the other blonde in the café looked fine - our girl should have moved in on his party. It just went from bad to worse, giving the Irish, the wedding photographic fraternity and blondes a bad name. Really it was dire. Question - in the scene where she finally walks away, why did she walk through a large puddle? Was that to show us how young and immature she really was? Too late - we knew. Question - don't really wealthy families do 21st birthday parties anymore? So that she got a take away, a Chinese fortune cookie and back into the arms of Mr irresistible. It was all too shallow, as though nobody really wanted to get too heavy. Pity really, it could not have made it any worse.

'Now, Voyager' not only qualifies, it might very well be the epitome of this kind of cinema. A young woman, held down by a domineering mother who manipulates and controls her, finally breaks away to live her OWN life, free to do as she pleases, even becoming more beautiful as she does so! You get the idea. Bette Davis was certainly at the top of her game when she made 'Now, Voyager' in 1942. She plays dowdy future spinster Charlotte Vale, who lives with and under the thumb of her mean old mother, um, Mrs. Vale (Gladys Cooper). Charlotte's pretty darn ugly at the first of the film, big bushy eyebrows, dressed unattractively, and supposedly overweight. I couldn't tell she was overweight, but everyone says that she is, so... Help arrives in the person of Dr. Jaquith (Claude Rains), who through therapy helps Charlotte discover her inner (and outer) beauty. Charlotte then takes an ocean cruise, where, now incredibly beautiful, she meet and falls in love with Jerry Durrance (Paul Henreid). If you've never seen 'Now, Voyager,' this is the film where Henreid lights two cigarettes at the same time, then takes one from his lips and hands it to Davis. In fact, he does it four or five times during the movie. Jerry is married when they meet, so that puts a damper on their romance. The ending is a bit unexpected for a film of this type; you might expect that Jerry gets a divorce or his wife dies and he and Charlotte end up together, but instead Charlotte ends up caring for one of his troubled daughters, which she considers his 'gift' to her and a way to always have him in her life. Their relationship remains platonic otherwise. They both seem content with this resolution, and the film ends with Bette Davis' classic line, Oh, Jerry, don't let's ask for the moon... we have the stars! I enjoyed 'Now, Voyager' for the performances and some of the dialogue, which alternates between sharp and soapy. Paul Henreid looks and sounds as if he walked right out of 'Casablanca.' Claude Rains is good, as always, as the shrink who helps Charlotte. But this is Bette Davis' show for the most part and it is one of her finest portrayals.

In fact Brazil is only mentioned in the song written above which is played numerous times throughout the movie. Why then is the movie called Brazil? It is a far away land from the twisted government and the run down world that the characters in this movie live in. The song lyrics give hope for an escape to paradise. A dreamland that is real.Sam Lowery is a dreamer himself. He has only one dream, to find the woman of his dreams. How does he escape from his life and into his fantasies? How does he make his dreams a reality? He gives up everything that makes him feel secure his job, his apartment, and even the rules. The most important thing that he gives up is the paper work. In his world he learns a life without paper work is free life.Sam Lowery is played by Jonathan Pryce. In order to help the audience relate to this character he was written as an unconfident clumsy day dreamer. He is the average man in an oppressed society. Pryce's performance was dead on. You feel sorry for him because he accidentally makes decisions that pull him into dangerous situations. He is jittery, nervous and paranoid. In his dreams he is a hero. He flies around with wings and wears metal armor. He is a romantic warrior. He is the perfect man that every woman dreams of. He is what every man dreams he could be.This film has a wide range of acting talents Ian Holm who plays Sam Lowery's cowardly boss, Robert De Niro who plays a rebel heating engineer stealing jobs from the government, Bob Hoskins who plays a government heating engineer restricted by paper work., Jim Broadbent plays a high society plastic sergeant, Katharine Helmond plays the ever image changing mother of Sam, and Kim Griest is both the lovely girl in Sam's dreams and a rough feminist trucker in the real world. Some cast members loved the script so much they didn't care what role they would be given just as long as they were in the film.The Director of Brazil is Terry Gilliam. He has a style that no other director can match. He has created a future where technology has failed us. It is a dirty future where people have forgotten what true happiness is. The government has convinced the people that the way they live is the right way. Gilliam has created a true dystopian society.Gilliam decided to put offices in closet size rooms with concrete walls littered with posters that promote Anti Trust. The walls and ceilings of the buildings are lined with hundreds of ducts. The city is littered with paper. He creates a true separation between the architecture of the rich and that of the poor. It gives the feeling that you are not in control of your own life. The towering ceilings make you feel that there is no way out. He chose locations that included, London's Dockland, a south London power station, a Kent oil refinery and the Paris d'Abraxis apartment complex in suburban Paris.It is a suit and hat world. Most of the rich characters are dressed as if they were from the 40's. High society resembles that of old Hollywood even though the story takes place in the near future. Dressing people in this fashion helps the story very much. It was almost as if we ere moving backwards as a society. The surroundings take control over ones life and they are less encouraged to make decisions for themselves. The production quality is definitely one of the strongest I have seen in a film.

If you do not endure to the end of Brazil you will miss out on an incredible experience and what I believe is the most thought provoking ending ","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"4 December 2008","score":"20 out of 26 people found the following review useful","review":" Sometimes you have to accept that you are the minority. I didn't find Casino Royale to be the ultimate 007 movie and I didn't think Batman Begins was the ultimate Batman movie. I think the Star Wars prequels deserve more credit and what people so viciously hated about Jar-Jar I will just never understand. But it's OK. I accept that. In these cases it's simply just a matter of taste. You don't agree with me, I don't agree with you? It's not the end of the world.There are however other times when you feel that you have seen an entirely different movie than others have. And as some movies like 2001 or Blade Runner were torn apart or frowned upon when they first came, they have grown into classics later on. Why? My guess is misconceptions and pre-set expectations.Now, I can't stop anybody from hating Steven Spielberg's Hook if they want to. But I think it's appropriate to raise my voice a little, in talking about what kind of a movie it actually is.First of all, it's always been clear to me that Hook isn't that much of a story of Peter Pan as it is a story of Peter Banning or, if you want to get far fetched, perhaps Spielberg himself. Peter Banning has no respect and takes no interest in his children; thematically, this is defined by the way he consistently denies their world as REAL. By their world, I mean the world of a child, the world of games, stories, action and adventure. Be it baseball, school plays, drawings, bedtime storytelling or indoor games, Peter Banning does not comprehend this world as a very real world - but it is real to his children, it's actually their only real world, since the adult world leaves no place for them.Now, the movie is all about Peter Banning finding respect for his children and understanding their world as real. In the movie, he becomes forced to do this. At first he is hooked, if you will, by the very real notion that his children have been kidnapped. That naturally catches his attention, and naturally to him, nothing could be more frightening or real. His motivation here is to simply bring back his children, but as it turns out he will have to totally enter the children's play-world and play, accepting their world as real.To make it entirely clear that the children's world IS REAL, the movie literary crosses the line between fantasy and reality and Tinkerbell arrives to Peter Banning. The movie suggests that he not only will have to play that he is Peter Pan, he undoubtedly IS Peter Pan and cannot get away from it. He is hereby forced into play. This continues when he arrives at Neverneverland. Again, he cannot escape this world and in my mind this world is not so much JM Barrie's creation as it is a realm that essentially embodies child's play in general. It's like locking a bad parent into a playground, forcing him to spend time with the children in there. Because Neverneverland IS all play and fun. The lost boys PLAY that they are the lost boys, the pirates PLAY that they are pirates, Dustin Hoffman is obviously PLAYING that he is Captain Hook and as much as Peter Banning has to be forced into actually being Peter Pan in order to force him into taking it seriously, he eventually also PLAYS that he is Peter Pan. The theme of adults not seeing their children, or taking their world as real, is common in Spielberg's films. Remember Drew Barrymore in E.T, suggesting that maybe grown-ups can't see E.T and later on, Dee Wallace's mother is in the very same room as E.T but can't seem to notice him, since she is not interested in hearing any stories about men from the moon, that is to say she doesn't take it for real. There is a thematically identical scene in Hook where Peter is served the empty plates with food that he cannot see until he understands that the play is all for real. It's the scene that most people remember from the movie, even those who don't like it, and I don't think it's any coincidence.This theme about believing and seeing children's fantasy world as REAL, is sprinkled all through the movie in just about every scene from beginning to end. But to underline that this movie essentially is about a man who will have to take his kids seriously, and not so much a movie where Peter Pan actually goes back to Neverneverland, the movie's final sequences have Peter Banning waking up by a Peter Pan-like statue, suggesting that perhaps it was all just a drunken dream. Note that I am not saying it was, because the movie clearly states that the events have taken place within the reality of the movie, it's not a it was all just a dream-ending, but the scene clearly points out that it doesn't really matter if it was all make-believe nor not, because in the eyes of a child, make-believe is just as real as the real world. Actually, the last line of the movie is To live would be an awfully big adventure so I think Spielberg is also suggesting that grown-ups too need to think of their life as something a little more romantic and adventurous.All in all, I think the movie has flaws and all, that's not what this comment is about, but I haven't seen these points anywhere so I figured I post my views. Hook is first and foremost not a What if?-story, and not a story of the adult Peter Pan. Yes it's what happens in the movie, but it's not what the movie is all about.Bangerang.

Well, folks, just blame M. Night Shyamalan.No, let me take that back...Let's not blame 'Night', but the sorry excuses for writers, producers and directors who called themselves attempting to surpass the brilliance of Shyamalan's best movie so far...THE SIXTH SENSE.With a smooth effortlessness that's just about as terrifying as the movie itself, Shyamalan brings us the damn-near perfect story of Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis in a role that shattered everyone's prejudices about him as an actor), a child psychologist who is shot by one of his former patients (an almost unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg), who then commits suicide. Sometime after this ordeal, feeling that he failed his late charge, Malcolm attempts to find redemption by helping out a distressed young boy named Cole Sear, (Haley Joel Osment's career-making performance). who can see dead people and communicate with them.At no time are you ever unaware of how much you care for these characters, and how extreme the situation is for them, which makes the shocks and scares twice as intense as any you could ever find in a PG-13-rated flick before, (except maybe for POLTERGEIST.) Plus there are fantastic performances all the way round by Willis and Osment, backed up by great turns by Toni Collette (who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress as Cole's tough- but-tender mom) and Olivia Williams as Malcolm's former fiancée.Even after multiple viewings, the storytelling skill that Shyamalan has is faultless, and still leaves you scratching your head as to how you could've missed the clues that lead to one of the most spellbinding, jaw-dropping endings to come along in many moons. Some people might figure it out in the first five minutes, but I will confess - Night so thoroughly pulled me into his world, that I wasn't one of them.SENSE was both a blessing and a curse to Shyamalan, since newly-won fans now expected ALL of his movies to have that tricky twist ending to stun and surprise them. Because of that, the quality of the movies that followed SENSE was inconsistent to say the least. People still debate about the merits of UNBREAKABLE and SIGNS, or even if THE VILLAGE should've been made at all.Personally, I like everything he's done since, flaws and all.

The girls' only hope for possibly surviving the night is Michael's former doctor, Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance), who knows exactly what his patient is capable of and what he really is, and that stopping him at any cost is the only priority he has in life. Yes, it's a slasher film and the plot defines it as such. But no other film of its kind looked, sounded or played quite like what the creative team of John Carpenter and Debra Hill managed to capture on film, thanks to a game and enthusiastic crew and a talented cast of then-unknowns, all working more for the thrill of making a movie than for the money, (which there was very little of at first .) So much has already been written about this movie, that there's very little of value that I can add. Except to say that everything that we horror hounds hold dear owes a debt of thanks to HALLOWEEN. If PSYCHO was the door to the future of horror films, this was the key that unlocked it, and thanks to Carpenter and company, Friday THE 13TH, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and everything else that followed got to 'come inside.'This should be the cornerstone of your DVD or VHS horror collection. It certainly is in mine.

He showed a rather dark black and white 16mm print. Even in that dark form I could see it was one of the most beautiful b&w films ever shot. It has since been restored, the picture now bright and beautiful. It's worth seeing for the photography alone, but it has so much more. If you're reading this you may know at least something about the history of this film, but in a nutshell it was made across 4 years, from 1949 to 1952, because Welles financed the film himself and whenever he ran out of money he would go act in other films to raise the money to reassemble the cast and continue. Some conversations would have one character talking with the reverse shot of the other actor being shot three years later! You never notice it! It's just a stunning achievement considering the difficulty he had in making the film that it even got finished let alone be as excellent a film as it is. If you've never seen filmed Shakespeare, this is a great place to start. I'm sure purists would complain since the text is quite edited, but Welles uses his own narration in fairly modern English to make the story easy to follow. As Othello, Welles is believable, regal and in the end, chilling and sad. He brings the man to life. The rest of the cast is outstanding, including Micheal MacLiammoir as a cunning and wicked Iago, and Canadian actress Suzanne Cloutier, giving an absolutely heart wrenching performance as Desdemona. The deathbed murder scene between Welles and Cloutier has powerful emotional impact. I believe this version of the story outshines the 1996 adaptation with Laurence Fishburne and Irene Jacobs, even though the newer film sticks closer to Shakespeare's text. Kenneth Brannagh was a good Iago, and the film has a wonderful score by CHarlie Mole, but Welles version is better paced and it hit me more emotionally.This restoration of Welles' Othello was a labor of love for the people that had to track down the film elements and try and reconstruct what Welles originally intended. Unlike Welles' Touch of Evil, which was re-edited by the studio and compromised in the process, Welles' owned Othello so the version that got released was his. Unfortunately, he was severely let down by the sound department. The original track was muddy, some voices had sync problems, and the music was badly recorded. The restoration crew cut out the dialog line by line, re-cut it to match the mouth movements, redid the Foley and all sound effects, and rerecorded Francesco Lavagnino's bold score in the exact tempo of the original recording. The final result is pretty amazing. And though this is not really the definitive version since Welles is no longer here, it's probably as close as we'll ever get to what the film could have been, if Welles had more money and time. Even so, back in 1952 it won the Palm d'Or at Cannes in its original form. Orson Welles' Tragedy of Othello is beautifully filmed Shakespeare with a strong cast. I believe it lives up to its reputation as one of Welles' finest efforts. For fans of Welles and Shakespeare, you'll probably find much to appreciate.

Now having had the chance to see the 20th Anniversary Edition from Dark Sky Films, I'm not so sure that I didn't remember it, as much as I didn't WANT to remember...John McNaughton presented the indie world with his calling card via this film, and simultaneously raised the bar for what realism is in these kinds of horror movies. And where the true horror lies is the way in which it deconstructs and de-glamorizes the image that Hollywood has created for serial killers. This is not a chronicle of a super-intelligent monster like Hannibal Lecter, or even the channeled virtuosity of a noble murderer like Dexter Morgan. This could be anybody you walked past down the street yesterday, or saw at the stop light on the way home from work. And make no mistake about it...he works at a job, pays rent and buys groceries like anybody else. And if you happen to catch yourself alone with him at the wrong time, the next time anyone will ever see you again is at the morgue. Count on it.Based loosely on the exploits of multiple murderer Henry Lee Lucas, HENRY was the breakout role for Michael Rooker (SLITHER), and together with co-stars Tom Towles as his dim-witted sidekick, Otis and Tracy Arnold as Otis' emotionally blasted sister, Becky, they paint a documentary-style picture under McNaughton's guidance, of how some people living on the fringes of society behave. This doesn't necessarily mean that they're wild-eyed, foaming-at-the-mouth-crazy, and therein lies the scariest part of all. These are the kind of blue-collar, salt-of-the-earth types that you might dismiss without giving a second thought...but the time might come when you do so at your own peril.From the opening frames of the movie, you know you're in territory that's far removed from the usual slasher film. Henry is seen doing mundane, everyday things - buying cigarettes, finishing lunch at a local diner - and juxtaposed with those scenes are absolutely horrific shots of dead, mutilated bodies, as the sounds of how they died careen and crash underneath the discordant music along the soundtrack. Sorry, kids, but this isn't THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE. In that picture, as within this one, a time and place is firmly established. But if you don't live in Texas, part of you can sort of remove yourself from the horror that wants to seep into your subconscious and stay there.With HENRY, it becomes obvious that the locale is somewhere in metropolitan Chicago, but the urban landscape is familiar enough that it could be Atlanta, Detroit, Boston, New York, anywhere. It could be the city where YOU live now.And by writing the characters and the events they're involved in with a totally detached, non-judgmental eye, McNaughton and writing partner Richard Fire reveal a horror more numbing and penetrating than a thousand Freddy Kruegers or Michael Myers. There are people in the world who actually do these kinds of things, and they're out there NOW...and it's only by the grace of providence or some cosmic lottery that we've won, that we don't ever run into these people...or that some of us unfortunately do.Enough has already been written about the remarkable performances of all the actors involved, so the only thing I can add is that if you've never seen HENRY, you need to watch it all the way through at least once. I can safely say that you will see why horror is the way it is today, and how so many filmmakers have misinterpreted what director McNaughton was saying with HENRY.With the searing images still fresh in my mind, I can only say this...I feel like I need to take about a hundred hot showers, and none of it will ever wash away how nasty and horrible it made me feel. Which I believe is exactly what the makers of this film were trying to accomplish.I sincerely hope that once you've seen this, you would feel the same.

It's a film movie-buffs never bring up when speaking of Hitchcock.I can't believe this. I love his films, but few of his films truly speak from deep in the heart, beyond the terror factor. This one explores some very dark places, as most of his films do. But I Confess goes to places where most people's sense of sacred ( biblically or romantically ) are afraid to go or question.Like Notorious, this film questions the idea of faith, love, devotion, hope, redemption, and forgiveness, on so many MANY levels, from almost every single character in this masterpiece. My intellectual and emotional mind were pounding a mile a minute as this story unfolded.The cinematography was...well, perfect. For the most part, it wasn't shot as a murder-mystery or terror-tale. Hitchcock, at least for me, had this filmed as a love story for most of its running length. Very sneaky. But the performances and editing were very much high intensity and believable. I thought, since Hitchcock ( wisely ) didn't want to have a priest playing action-hero in this story, directing and filming most of it that way, made total sense. This method under-scored the priest's dignity, the love between he and his former lover's character, and the love between he and his higher faith.

Martin and Candy are absolutely hilarious as the mismatched buddies trying to make it home for Thanksgiving.Both Martin and Candy play their parts to absolute perfection. What you have here is a genuinely funny script made twice as funny by two very very good comedians at the absolute top of their game. The facial expressions alone are good for scores of laughs throughout the film.Add to this that the film blends in a poignant and touching storyline that may take you by surprise and you have a truly rare film. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry. The screenplay works beautifully.As a final note, I couldn't quite give the film a 10, merely because I am a bit disappointed in the language in the film.
