Along the way we have spectacular vistas of mountains, gorges, snow-laden firs, and rickety wooden bridges. Throw in the derailing of some cars and a couple of dynamite explosions at the end. Add a good cast and a director who had done some admirable work in Will Penny, and you have a generally satisfying movie.Railroad movies are usually satisfying in one way or another. The train rattles along, everything inside tic-tocs from side to side. There is the distant rumble and measured clicks of iron wheel across iron rail. Spaces are small and cozy. Landscapes roll past the windows and there is the occasional clang and flashing light of a warning at a railroad crossing. Somehow it makes you want to curl up and go to sleep, as if in a cradle.But, truth be told, things get a little hairy when you have half a dozen conspirators who have loaded the train up with arms to be sold to the renegade Indians. The Indians here don't get much respect, anymore than they did in real life. In addition to illegal rifles we brought all kinds of 19th-century infectious diseases to the West. Sometimes cholera or smallpox just wiped out a good portion of the tribe (Blackfeet) and sometimes demolished it entirely (Mandan).The script is a little confusing and weakens towards the end, after the Reveal.

The problem is that we don't need to have the camera spell it out for us. Why gild the flower? Of course clichés, like stereotypes, are functional, otherwise they wouldn't have become clichés. Lesser imaginations use them all the time even though they condescend to the audience.For all its defects, though, the film captivates a viewer with its old-fashioned railroad story. Maybe it's just me, but I love 'em. I like trains a lot more than I like airplanes, which have an alarming tendency to fall down. Then there is the cast, saddled though they may be with predictable and easily forgotten dialog. Jill Ireland is especially nice.

It's no exaggeration to say that this Mills and Boon reject could easily have been the product of some 16 year old schoolgirl's frustrations of unrequited love. Practically anyone who can work a typewriter can write a story like this. It's akin to sitting in front of a piano, randomly making pleasant sounding harmonies using the white keys, then claiming you've written a symphony. Whilst it may sound pleasant enough, it would exhibit none of the skill and brilliance that would make it true art. So it is with this &#150; anyone can imagine a series of events and write them down, then claim they have written a screenplay. But it takes knowledge of story construction and a great deal of skill to create gripping, emotionally involving drama. The only emotions created by this dog of a story are frustration and bemusement as to how anyone could think this was a good idea for a film.The screenwriter doesn't appear to have a grasp of the basic structure of drama. For example, all the setbacks are resolved within minutes of screen time. That's not drama! That's like television, where everything has to be resolved quickly to fit within a 22 minute episode. True drama is about struggle &#150; the protagonist rising up and using all his strength to attain the central goal. In this movie, a setback occurs, and then like clockwork, its resolution conveniently appears out of the blue in the next scene.This pattern of wasted opportunities continues until towards the end, when Mildred is about to do something that would have created real tension and interest &#150; I found myself thinking oh no, Mildred! Don't do that! And what do you know? She didn't do it. Another opportunity wasted. So much for drama! Perhaps the single biggest problem with the story is that the central concept &#150; a man's obsession with a woman &#150; is ridiculously unbelievable. Howard's character, Phillip Carey, is a semi-respectable gentleman, and yet he somehow manages to fall head-over for a vulgar wench of a woman who is completely devoid of all charm. A few insulting words from her at a café and suddenly he's on cloud nine. She continues to abuse him and treat him like an automatic teller machine; she still has absolutely no charm and nothing in common with him, and yet he still feels compelled to leave a much more attractive and charming woman for her, and even fantasises about her to the point of distraction during his medical exam. This particular sequence was so ridiculous that I almost laughed out loud. It was rather like seeing Phillip fantasise about John Cleese in a dress, doing his 'handbag lady' character. That anyone could possibly find Mildred attractive is well beyond my ability to suspend my disbelief and this is a fatal flaw given that Phillip's obsession is the central theme of the film. The ability of the audience to identify with the protagonist is a crucial element of successful drama and it is sorely lacking here.The fact that Bette Davis was nominated for an Oscar for this performance really shows just how meaningless an accolade they truly are. Had she portrayed Mildred with initial charm and attractiveness, then little by little revealed her corrupt, selfish interior, then perhaps the performance would have been something to admire. Instead, she portrayed Mildred as the ghastly, vulgar gold-digger she was right from the beginning and destroyed any concept of how Phillip could possibly have fallen for her. They might as well have cast some vulgar cockney waitress off the street in the role, for all Davis brought to it. Similarly, Howard displays the same adequate but charmless, boring mediocrity he brought to every role he ever played.The obligatory credit-where-it's-due part at least the directing is slightly cinematic, rather than just being a filmed play, as many of these overly talky 30s films tend to be. With that aside this movie is, in a word, abysmal. In five words it is laughable, nauseating, boring, contrived and unwatchable.

Wilder is a man who never failed to create the perfect slice of entertainment, as he once said movies should be like amusement parks. Although, Some Like It Hot is a flawed film and not on the same level as Wilder's true cinematic masterpieces it still remains a highly accomplished work of entertainment. And there are no wonders as to why it was ranked no.1 on AFI's Funniest Movies of All-Time; it truly is a spectacle in the art of comedy.Some Like it Hot contains one of the most simple, yet wonderfully unique premises of all-time. Set during the prohibition Some Like It Hot follows the mishaps of two male musicians who are looking for a job, while being caught up with the mob. Unable to find work they opt in to play for a female band and so have to cross-dress to gain discreet access to the band. Surprisingly both fit in with the group and quickly befriend Sugar (Marilyn Monroe), a friendship that soon develops into them both falling for her...The idea of Some Like It Hot is incredibly outlandish and extraordinarily outrageous. The film's complex was a long way ahead of its time and one that was risqué and daring on release due to the supposed homosexuality portrayed in the film. Today, the film remains one of the triumphant examples of comedy, ultimately being a satire on '20s America portrayed through slyly hysterical humour. The film shows off the talents of Wilder and the array of talent he has cast on the film. The rampant script propels the film at extraordinarily fast pace and uses subtle metaphysical language to portray half-disguised sexual-innuendo. The sexual-innuendo remains one of the film's highlights due to the way it is incorporated into the script through fast wit, raunchiness and flashy language. To simply imply the script is good is an understatement; the script's craftsmanship is beyond the realm of genius and is so goofy, screwy and intelligent that it is impossible to deny the brilliance.Some Like It Hot is a film I can watch anytime, due to the amount of material and level of enjoyment on offer, it is a film bursting with charisma and charm. Actors Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are two of the finest American actors to ever grace cinema, their partnership created through the fantastic chemistry is inseparable. It is an example of pure character acting at the top of its game. Jack Lemmon (as with most of the films he starred in) steals the show with his wildly energetic, charismatic and fitting the role performance. Jack Lemmon's persona is so uplifting, consistently succeeding in being the actor's actor. Then you have the hysterical Tony Curtis who brings bold hilarity and fierce energy to the screen, an actor who always feels suitably cast. Marilyn Monroe on the other hand is an actress I have always felt to be untalented at acting, yet skilled at working with spontaneous comedy and probably due to her own infamous personality. Although not a good actress, she is still cast with accuracy and slides into her role as Sugar with ease because of her own similarities to the character. She also adds another element of iconic value to the film.Although there is nothing much below the surface of Some Like It Hot that does not stop it from being an intellectual illustration of class A comedy. For a film so eccentric it is honestly amazing at how remarkably efficient the film is at succeeding in offering mass-appeal. Some Like It Hot is full of dry sexual tendencies, symbolic sexual imagery (yes, not only hidden in the script, but subtly shown throughout the film) and the indisputable class the film carries. The use of simple set-pieces helps rotate the comedy, offering impulsive comedic actions and a countless array of jokes.The film's notorious line well, nobody's perfect goes for the film too. Although not as perfect as Wilder's league of their own masterpieces (Sunset Blvd., The Apartment, Double Indemnity, Stalag 17) that still does not stop it from being a gem of cinematic joy. Wilder is one of the few directors who truly deserves his legendary directional and screen writing acclaim, it is beyond fact that Wilder had a genuine aptitude for cinema.

I did enjoy Gene Hackman as Doyle though,he definitely fit the part. Oh oh and I did like the shake down at the diner to talk to their stool.Overall this movie sucked story wise but the action was cool especially for its time. I'd recommend reading the book.

Myself, I liked this movie allot. Sorta brings back memories of my early 20's when i lived with a woman and trying to balance the party scene with the friends. Belushi's character is a riot. The scenes at the local watering spot brought back memories of my old hangouts. Also the fighting sequences seem to ring true with me. Who should clean the apartment, can each others friends deal with each other, still going out and having fun but being in a serious relationship. Its one of the 80's movies i still like to watch. Unlike others that i used to like back than like Sixteen candles or Pretty in Pink which i have scene lately and I'm like, this is garbage. I didn't have sandwich night, we had invite everyone over and party night.

The viewer is asked to believe that a well brought up but penniless orphan (Kate Beckinsale) comes to live with relatives who mostly despise her and hate one another and who want desperately to leave this wretched, filthy, gloomy farm but cannot do so because of a tyrannical recluse of a family matriarch who is holed up in her room, consuming enormous quantities of food -- and in the course of an hour and a half, the plucky young orphan has transformed the lives of everyone on the farm, including the matriarch and the gloomy, mad cousin who invited her to come live with them because of a unexplained but terrible wrong done to the young woman's father by this family. Kate Beckinsale is outstanding in the role of the orphaned young woman and Ian McKellen effortlessly steals the picture from everyone but Beckinsale in his role as a fire-and-brimstone preacher whom Kate's character persuades to leave the farm to his eldest son and pursue his mission of preaching his terrifying gospel to the world. The picture has its moments, mostly because of Beckinsale and McKellen, though there is also a wonderful bit involving a Hollywood producer friend of the young orphan's who is persuaded to visit the farm and make a movie star of the lecherous younger brother. Mostly, however,Cold Comfort Farm is thin gruel and not nearly as amusing as the people who made it seem to think it is.
