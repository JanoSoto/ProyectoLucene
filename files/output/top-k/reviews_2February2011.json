When I learned that this move was directed by him (I didn't see the film until 3 years after it came out), I was dying to see it. I had watched the 1968 original and was familiar with the original novel. After seeing it, in all honesty it was the biggest waste of garbage I had ever seen. Oh sure the make up and special effects were good, they always are, that's why they spend so much time working on that stuff rather than writing a good plot or developing characters. The dialogue was cheap and the acting was more wood than a redwood tree! Mark Wahlburg's acting was so out of place for this film, throughout the entire film, he really shows no emotion and when he does it's only for a split second. I wasn't expecting something like that of Charleston Heston's epic role in the original (heck his role in this film was only minor yet beats the crap out of the rest of the cast), but I'd at least expect some effort to be put in it. All the characters really just filled out the stereotypical roles seen in the real world today from the war mongering general, the peaceful animal loving hippie, the rebellious doubtful sergeant, the ignorant leaders, the royal waitress, and the bumbling idiots the humans. The plot was as straight forward as a derailed train. Everything was just hoping around and far fetched even for a movie like this. It is basically this, guy lands on planet, gets caged, frees a bunch of prisoners, goes through a chase in the desert, rounds up prisoners, rebels, uses rocket buried in the sand for centuries to blast away charging army. Than monkey comes from the sky and everyone is best friends with each other. h yeah, Apes can not swim, because... well that's never explained. And the end was the worst attempt at a twist I have ever seen. And it's bad when the director in the commentary couldn't even make heads or tails out of it. I was relieved when the end credits came. That was the last Tim Burton film I have seen and since seeing this utter failure I avoid all his films, even the ones I liked before. If you don't want to take my word for it, fine, but don't blame me for wasting your time with this sad excuse for a movie.

John's wife Holly who is played by Bonnie Bedilia has relocated to L.A. and has become a vice president for a corporation called Nakatomi. Shortly after when Jon arrives at the Nakatomi towers to see his wife at a Christmas party, a terrorist group led by Hans Grueber who is played by Alan Rickman seizes control of the building. John manages to escape capture and becomes involved in taking down the terrorists. John manages to inform the police and Sgt. Al Powell played by Reginald Veljohnson from the LA police department. The movie then turns into John McClane against 12 bad guys in a plot themed cops and robbers action type movie.When a movies theme is a focus on plot, the movie is meant to be an escape from everyday life (Boggs, Petrie 2008). This is usually obtained by having very fast paced and exciting action. Die Hard definitely fits into this role. Wants the movie gets going it is pretty much nonstop action from beginning to end. There is lots of shooting and explosions and the special effects in this area are fantastic. Along with the plot theme there is another theme with a focus on character. In this case it is John McClane and how his character is developed. As the film progresses we start to understand John as the hero that he is. He doesn't choose to be, but he is thrust into this situation and his natural instincts as the hero are shown.To go with the action plot theme Die Hard does a good job of using sound to establish the action that we see on the screen. Whenever there is an action theme we hear a very fast paced action type soundtrack. This helps to inform the audience of what is about to take place on the film. Another aspect that the film uses is camera angles. Many of the times that the camera shows John McClane, it shows him in a close up or from a down angle looking up at him. The close up shots let us connect with John and his emotions and the angles further emphasize the hero role as we all look up to him.The movie Die hard is nothing new.

But can you hang an entire movie on it, or a legion of drooling fans who seem to know every inch of the celluloid in obsessive detail? And indeed, there's a lot to know about Sleepaway Camp --- a bit too much, if you want to know the truth. It seems to be a film that was written backwards, around the shocking ending, and so much intricate detail was fussed over and invented that it eventually became too much for the script or the cast to carry off successfully in a little over 80 minutes.It's one of those movies that end and you still have many unanswered questions. I believe the answers are there but the script doesn't allow for enough scenes to adequately render the clues. It's an especially galling problem in the opening scene upon which much of the coherency of the movie later rests. Another chronic problem is the abysmal level of the acting. Desiree Gould is either a spectacularly bad actress or she was trying way, way too hard. Mike Kellin's performance careens from incoherent to embarrassing way too often to be salvageable, and Karen Fields as the standard bitch-girl has all the wit and depth of a bridge and tunnel extra on Jersey Shore. What SC does have going for it is Felissa Rose. Her woodenness actually works to her advantage and her deliberately invoked catatonia really works to create some interest and mystique around her character in the few times she does verbalize. I also found the opening credit montage eerie and well photographed. Some of the murders were inventive and refreshingly brutal for its time period, others are biz-as-usual.It really adds up to a big case of first-time director-itis. Hiltzik desperately needed someone to tell him to look HARDER for better actors, to CUT 2-3 minutes off the five minute softball scene that adds nothing to the movie, to ADD scenes that more explicitly spell out the nuances in his overly complex, if not intriguing, storyline. In short, it needed another producer besides Hiltzik to shape things a bit more.It could have been the slasher genre's answer to Psycho, if it had been a little more finely crafted. Instead, it's a cult fave for people with an obsession over the character of Mozart, who has a total of about 3 lines in the picture. Whatever works for you, I guess.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"2 February 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Robert Hiltzik's cult 1983 slasher could very well be the most uneven entry in the genre that had its heyday from 1978 to about 1984.It's virtually undebatable that the film's gender-bending ending is shocking, well-executed in both production and acting, and even iconic in its grand-guignol style imagery (remember, this was before Crying Game). But can you hang an entire movie on it, or a legion of drooling fans who seem to know every inch of the celluloid in obsessive detail? And indeed, there's a lot to know about Sleepaway Camp --- a bit too much, if you want to know the truth. It seems to be a film that was written backwards, around the shocking ending, and so much intricate detail was fussed over and invented that it eventually became too much for the script or the cast to carry off successfully in a little over 80 minutes.It's one of those movies that end and you still have many unanswered questions. I believe the answers are there but the script doesn't allow for enough scenes to adequately render the clues.

Director Gary Fleder, here, proves he can tackle a thriller in every sense of the word, operating in what you must admit to being a workmanlike and engaging enough manner to supplement a recommendation. Being able to sit there and box tick where it is characters suffer epiphanies and will eventually come to garner the upper hand is not the point; watching a director carefully execute a concept thriller whilst balancing the basic but enjoyable plot mechanisms and manoeuvring the characters around in a thorough and competent enough fashion whilst adhering, in an entertaining manner, to both generic demands and conventions is what is enjoyably garnered the most out a film like this.The film runs on a workable premise linked to that of a specific number, a number that is hard to come by and a number which will garner its bearer access to that of a priceless ruby located out and around the New York City area. The catch is, that it's embedded within the mind of somebody whom very rarely is in the mood to tell it, indeed anything, to anyone at all; furthermore, the lives of certain people our eventual protagonist dearly loves will come to be in great danger, and his ability to obtain this number will dictate as to whether they survive. The protagonist is a certain Nathan Conrad, a doctor and educated psychiatrist; an easy glide across his office which harbours his credentials in the form of certificates and qualifications outlining his knowledge and experience within the field. In his office, he's calm amidst a delicate situation and keeps cool and methodical where others may have acted out in a different, more negative manner, when he enlightens, in an unpatronising manner, some stern speakings to a young high-schooler sent to the good doctor on account of stealing certain clothing garments belonging a female colleague at school. Out of the office, he's working up at a mental institute named Bridgville, partaking in a rapid-fire exchange about the ins and outs of various things within the field to an accomplice, thus highlighting both the general professionalism and clinical ability of his nature.Conrad will later come to have to deal with a situation of an even more delicate nature, that being when Sean Bean's professional thief Patrick Koster and his crew get out of prison following a ten year stretch linked to the theft of a ruby. It is not, however, the theft of a priceless ruby which incarcerated them, more-so the careless murder in a public place of a back-stabbing accomplice which sends them all down; their taking over of a Manhatten apartment overlooking Conrad's own sparking into life a chain of events linked to a young patient at Bridgeville named Elisabeth Burrows (Murphy), and more specifically, the aforementioned number she knows which will somehow bring about the ruby for Koster and crew. With Nathan's young daughter taken and imprisoned within the apprehended apartment to compensate for police interference, and Nathan's wife, in Famke Janssen's character Aggie, flat on her back and therefore incapacitated by way of a cast around a broken leg, our lead must face the fight of a ticking clock alone.The film keeps the villains basic but effectively nasty; Bean in particular taking glee at playing it lean and mean; an incarnation of a British gangster whom has somehow ended up performing heists at jewellers based in New York City with a ditsy array of criminal cohorts, a disparate group of your more typical movie bad-guys ranging from the hulking brute that says very little but is good enough to guard a hostage to the ugly, thin, wormy looking guy charged with slinking around on a motorcycle following the lead's every move. Even more bizarrely, one sidekick even appears to channel that of African-American hacker Theo, in John McTiernan's 1988 film Die Hard, a sports obsessed; rather loud mouthed and perhaps overly cynical technological whizz brought along for all the stuff related to laptops and monitors. The film additionally covers a female police detective named Sandra Cassidy (Esposito), someone sharp in seeing what others seemingly do not; her observations on a dead body an object lesson in homicide evaluation to her male cohorts. While the presence of a strong female character in this regard dutifully makes up for the fact the only other woman even close to the action is Famke Janssen stuck in a bed-placed position, the film struggles with her overall placement in regards to proceedings; as if starting at the end as to how she becomes more inherently involved in the film was focused upon before the effective working backwards so as to try and tie her in more and more.Fleder keeps things moving along in a smooth and sharp manner, so much so that we are engaged in each of the respective characters' plights and involved enough to, on one or two occasions, be somewhat affected by the transitions and realisations certain characters must drag themselves through when the time demands it. We come to dislike the baddies just as much as we come to sympathise with the supporting Murphy, her subplot seeing her forced into the role of the victim during one's childhood and neatly going on to echo the role of Nathan's daughter when she herself is caught up in the middle of all this; both of whose plights are effectively caused by the same lone individual and the greed that person accentuates- it coming to endanger those whom they love concurrent with those others hold just as dear as the effect ripples down.

It is without a doubt one of my all time favorites. I remember watching this movie as a little kid and it scared the hell out of me! The key of the movie is the atmosphere that the movie creates. The actors are great, it has Sarah Connor before The Terminator, and the kids are surprisingly very good. John Franklin as Isaac is a great performance and a great character, he's magnific and creepy. Courtney Gains as Malachai is a great character, with a great look, memorable face and lines.But the best thing about this movie is the music! The music here is absolutely genius! It gives me chills every time I hear that tune, especially the scene with Linda Hamilton's dream. That scene gave me nightmares as child and it still scares me! It's a great movie, with great story, great actors, great characters, great lines, genius music and great atmosphere. I LOVE THIS MOVIE! ","genre":"Horror, Thriller"}]
