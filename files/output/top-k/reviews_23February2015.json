Everything is just a little bit different than the norm here, camera-work, acting and casting. This unique style turned out to be a home-run in the theaters and is widely known as one of the top horror films out there. Texas Chainsaw Massacre provides a couple of the most memorable scenes in horror for at least myself when Leatherface is first introduced into the plot. The first two consecutive death scenes were pretty scary when I first saw the movie when I was a kid. If you don't know what I'm talking about, the scenes involve a hammer, slamming door and a meat hook. Can't forget how classic the dinner scene is too. I do have a huge gripe though with Texas Chainsaw being the extremely annoying character of Franklin. There is no reason for a filmmaker to create a character that unlikable, to the point as a viewer of me clapping when he faces his demise. All the other characters were great however, especially the family of psychos. The family really portrayed the part of crazy lunatics to the next level. Those actors made me wonder if they were actually that crazy in real life. Texas Chainsaw will continue to be a timeless classic that will be looked at as a contributor to different transitions in horror cinema.

Go see this movie. It's not that bad as it seem. It's honestly pretty alright. I have to say, this isn't your run-of-the-mill cheesy Slasher monkey horror film like 1990's Shakma & 1995's Congo. This is a pretty smart psychological thriller that you can go bananas for! Written and directed by George A. Romero, the film is based on a novel with the same title authored by Michael Stewart. Monkey Shines An Experiment in Fear tells the story of an ex-track athlete, Alan Mann (Jason Beghe), whom became paralyzed when struck by a truck. Mann fails to adjust to his condition, becoming suicidal and despondent. To help Alan out, his friend Geoffrey Fischer (John Pankow) trained a monkey named Ella (Boo the Monkey) to help him with his paralysis. What he doesn't know is that Geoffrey has been experimenting with Ella, genetically alter her brain that cause the little monkey to develop more human-like deep feelings, and rage, against its new master and her monkey trainer, Melanie Parker (Kate McNeil). I can understand why, people might overlook this movie. The little monkey is too cute. Whose idea was it to use a capuchin monkey as a villain? Why didn't they just use a bigger ape? While, a capuchin monkey seem silly as a villain. There is a way to portray it, right like what they did in 1995's Outbreak. They was able to do it, because that monkey in that movie was carrying a deadly disease that cause its villains to have violent and gory deaths. This movie didn't have any of that, fears, because it lacks gore. The movie is a bit laughable as the small monkey tries to poison and burn fully grown human beings. Clearly, Boo has no clue, what she was doing. Most of the action in the film is very unintentionally hilarious. The crash scene involving a running man, a barking dog and flying bricks is just cheesy. While, I couldn't see the monkey as a serious threat. I did love, how the movie portray their relationship. The relationship built up is a genuinely loving one. It was a deep bond, between the two that's right out of any kid's animal movie and then it got really bizarre, with Alan picks up on Ella's primal behavior, and Ella picks up on Allan's feelings of frustration, rage and revenge. The movie never explain this odd empathy of two, as both feel increasing in love with each other. It almost beasty. As if the movie was trying to channel the same themes of horror in Gothic tales like Beauty and the Beast, Planet of the Apes & the Island of Doctor Moreau, where no matter, how civilize you can act, you still have one foot, out of the jungle. I guess, the movie was trying to say something like a link from man to beast, but it never fully explained satisfactorily leaving a gaping plot hole that is a wart to what the film is trying to accomplish. I had actually read Monkey Shines. It was not a great read, but it's explain the concept, better than the movie, with the main character taking the same pills intended to increase the learning ability of his primate companion, but in the movie, it's never explained. Why and how exactly does Geoffrey's intelligence-boosting potion wind up linking Ella to Alan psychically? Who Knows! The movie doesn't bothered with it. The concept of the story has some interesting aspects. The life of a quadriplegic is an interesting subject, and you see it, with the great acting from Jason Beghe. You really see the struggle of it, through his facial expression and eyes. Kate McNeil is very convincing as the energetic, robust and beautiful trainer. Together, Beghe and McNeil make a cute couple on screen, and unlike other viewers, I didn't find the sex scene between them weird. It's very rare to see how severely handicapped are able to make love. Their love scene is very sensual, proving that the handicapped can do most anything. A young Stanley Tucci is a cool look, as the supporting character, despicable neurosurgeon Dr. John Wiseman. I really couldn't believe that was him. Most of the rest of the supporting cast was alright in their roles. Boo the monkey was the star of the film, big time. Without her, the movie couldn't had work. A lot of people might hate this movie, due to the fact, that they have a monkey as a villain. Watching a monkey maim and kill people could be pretty traumatic for younger and even some older viewers I would imagine. PETA might jump in, for the very controversial ending. The ending was so controversial that the film's distributor, Orion Pictures, forced Romero to add a happy ending to the picture, a plot device which the director had long avoided in favor of more ambiguous endings, because they were desperate for a hit, as it was in financial difficulty. Second, after poor previews, the studio recut the film without Romero's knowledge to add a shock ending. While, there are tons of alternate endings. It didn't help the film, much. Overall Unfortunately, the plotting and scripting is quite weak. The pacing, a bit too long. The concept is interesting, but the execution leaves much to be desired. Still, it's worth watching, at least once. Monkey see monkey do.

They MAY get a better understanding after JJ Abrams returns the trilogy to it's awesome roots.The first Star Wars film, known simply as Star Wars, was a land- breaking milestone of film-making, with a story, characters, and effects(not all effects are cgi people) that melded together into the greatest interplanetary adventure of all-time(at least until the sequel came out).Today's generation can pick between Spiderman, Ironman, Captain America, and the Guardians of the Galaxy to find the film that they love the most, but when I was a kid there was one film, or should I say one trilogy, that stood far, FAR above the rest. The number one argument that is made today by the younger generation is that the effects are outdated etc, but it was in fact Lucas' commitment(at least early on) to use models and make-up to create a world like no other. SOmething that CGI just can't capture. When I saw Guardians in the theater I thought it was amazing, but later I saw it on the 4G TV, and like many flicks, it kinda accentuated the small flaws of the cgi and the set-pieces, whereas I watch Star Wars and it actually shows how amazing the film was in that aspect.CGI isn't necessarily an improvement. It's films like Star Wars and Blade Runner, whose Gritty qualities actually add realism to an unreal world. The only problems I have with the first three Star Wars films are the digitally enhanced versions that Lucas added later. That's why I eagerly await the original untouched films' release on Blue-Ray.Scores usually drop a bit over time, and as it stands now, the weakest of the original trilogy is scored 8.4(Return of the Jedi), and that is higher than Avengers, Guardians, Cap 2, and Ironman, and FOR GOOD REASON.And the original Star Wars is a superior film in every way as well. No Hokey opening like Avengers, no lack of storyline like Guardians, no under-menacing not required to act Villain like Cap 2, and while I can't nitpick anything about Ironman, overall it just doesn't stand-up against Star Wars, it's a beatdown.Simply put, it's EVERYTHING about it that makes it better. The acting, the story, the character development, the scale of the production, the start, the finish, the middle and every minute in- between.Part of the problem here is that the added material in the re- released versions really detracts from the original films flow. The stupid dancing crap in Jedi, the Walking Jabba in Star Wars, etc... it did nothing but hurt the original films. The only added footage that didn't detract from the original films was some of the added bells and whistles to Cloud City in Empire, and Biggs early appearance in empire, which was wasn't an 'enhancement', it was cut-footage from the original tapes, other than that, the added stuff only hurt the overall quality of the original films.

The acting, the story, the character development, the scale of the production, the start, the finish, the middle and every minute in- between.Part of the problem here is that the added material in the re- released versions really detracts from the original films flow. The stupid dancing crap in Jedi, the Walking Jabba in Star Wars, etc... it did nothing but hurt the original films. The only added footage that didn't detract from the original films was some of the added bells and whistles to Cloud City in Empire, and Biggs early appearance in empire, which was wasn't an 'enhancement', it was cut-footage from the original tapes, other than that, the added stuff only hurt the overall quality of the original films. He basically added stuff that was the kind of stuff that ruined the second trilogy, so the original untouched films are still the real gem here. And that's not what these kids are watching either, because the untouched versions are HARD TO FIND!DOn't even exist on DVD or blu-ray. One of the times I'm glad I still have my VHS. Uh-Oh, Gotta-go, Re-tro)And WHile I love the new marvel films, they don't have what Star Wars and it's two sequels(i'm a purist) have.. that tangible something you CAN put your finger on - because it's REAL.. they built those ships, they designed and made those costumes and set-pieces. That kind of attention to detail, and scale just isn't in the Marvel films. Sure, it's cool to see Hulk crumbling down a building, but this galaxy really doesn't SEEM so far away in Star Wars. It has that 'realistic' edge to it.Even some of my favorite Sci-Fi's of all-time like Blade Runner and 2001, while milestone's in their own right, just do not have the sheer entertainment value that Star Wars has.97\/100Star Wars and Empire are 2 of the 42 out of the 3400 films that I have ranked 10\/10, and they are two of the most deserving, if not THE most deserving.

Not only is The Breakfast Club amazing, but it is also timeless. It is honestly empathetic to just about anyone who has gone through high school, no matter the circumstances and I think that is one reason why many people connect with this movie. Most people who have gone through high school have experienced the several clichés and cliques that circulate around the school. The Breakfast Club just mainly focuses on the nerds, the jocks, the lost causes, the preppy girls and the future criminals. Going to a big high school myself, I happened to experience all of these stereotypical groups head on. Not only that, but I was also subject to detention on several occasions for various reasons. Right off the bat, I was hooked right there. The movie revolves around five teenagers that were all given a Saturday detention for whatever punishment they did while in school earlier that week. Each of them briefly knowing one another from seeing each other out and about inside the school but none of them really knew how similar they really were. Throughout the movie, each of them tends to get a little closer with one another. They laugh, they cry, they share stories, they dance, they smoke a little marijuana, and they come out with an open mind at the end. At the end, they all come out learning more about where each other came from and how they grew up and come out learning a huge lesson. There were also little lessons jam packed throughout the movie that many people seem to overlook but after watching it several times, I began to pick each out one by one. One of the smaller lessons taught in the movie was when Andy said, We're all pretty bizarre. Some of us are just better at hiding it, that's all. This is true. Everyone is weird and everyone has different things that separate him or her from one another. The thing is that some people tend to show their true colors more than some other people. Some people are more comfortable in their own skin than the next so they tend to bring out those bizarre colors. Another small lesson that seems overlooked in the movie is when Brian and John get in a small altercation and Brian said, Do you know without trigonometry, there'd be no engineering? and Bender follows up with Without lamps, there'd be no light. Both of the boys are right but what Bender is saying is that you can't enjoy the intricate things in life without the simpler things. The biggest lesson The Breakfast Club taught viewers that labels are not for people; they are more suitable for things like food or clothing. In simple terms, each of them learned that you should never judge a book by its cover or its stereotype. Just because a person hangs out with a certain group does not mean they think just like that person or come from the same background as that person. In Andy's case, the jocks at school were not also dumb and senseless and in Brian's case, the nerds weren't always up in the library studying for every single thing. We are all different in many ways and we should all own who we are. Though that is easier said than done, it can be pulled off. Not only was this movie easy to connect with and had many lessons that can be carried all throughout one's lifetime, but it was also packed with humorous scenes such as the iconic dancing scene, the marijuana smoking and a few more. It may be because I'm a bit biased towards comedy movies, but I love to have a good laugh, especially from a witty, sarcastic comment, which this movie was full of. All in all, The Breakfast Club is a timeless classic. Just about anyone who has been through high school, especially a bigger one can connect to this movie. Honestly, I think anyone who watches this movie will take away a life long lesson and have a good laugh as well. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.
