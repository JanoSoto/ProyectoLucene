In most films of this genre, the main character is almost invariably a young man whose aspirations rise no higher than that of getting laid, hanging ten with his buddies, or partaking of every illegal narcotic known to mankind.  Shaun Brumder, however, has loftier goals.  His main dream is to gain acceptance into Stanford University where he will be able to study under the renowned Martin Skinner, a successful author whose work has inspired Shaun to want to become a writer himself.  The only problem is that all the dysfunctional people in Shaun's life seem to be conspiring to keep his dreams from ever becoming a reality.  Whether it be his incompetent college guidance counselor, his `illiterate' English teacher, his alcoholic mother, his insensitive father, his maniacal, perpetually wasted brother, or his empty-headed, directionless surf buddies, Shaun seems surrounded by people who, whether consciously or unconsciously, seem determined to bring him down to their level.  The humor of the film, therefore, arises from the tension that develops between all these youth comedy clichés and stereotypes and the central hero who can't help but appeal to our own understanding and sympathy.Young Colin Hanks makes Shaun into a very likable central character, a rock of sanity in this sea of swirling madness.  Jack Black, as Shaun's brother, shows once again that nobody does a better job than he at impersonating the dumb slob loser, following in the honorable footsteps of `Animal House's John Belushi.  Schuyler Fisk provides warmth and charm as Shaun's understanding girlfriend, the one levelheaded person in Shaun's coterie of family members, friends and acquaintances.  And Catherine O'Hara and John Lithgow hit comic high notes as Shaun's crazy, mixed up parents.  Harold Ramis, Lily Tomlin, Chevy Chase, Kevin Kline and a host of other big name stars make effective cameo appearances in the film.At times one wishes that writer Mike White and director Jake Kasdan had aspired to create a richer, subtler comedy than the one they've ultimately come up with.  Shaun's story might have been more interesting had the filmmakers not always been so eager to go for the broad caricature, the tired pratfall, the easy laugh.  `Orange County' may be better than most films of its ilk, but that really isn't saying much in the long run.  It's ultimately, when all is said and done, a pretty dumbed-down little comedy.  Still, given what one might be led to expect from its advertising, `Orange County' also has its moments of unanticipated appeal and charm.

He finds out that (gulp) apes rule, then gets shot for his discovery (same as Taylor). Is rewarded with white, stinging vet powder plentifully poured on his (still bleeding) gunshot wound, by Zira.

Escapes while apes on horseback fire their guns at him. Goes underground and realizes where he's at. Painful!...and the movie is only into its first 45 minutes. What else can happen to the poor guy?

Then!... he's required to sit still during mass (for some people, this is very painful) and realizes that everyone else in attendance is a replicant of Gray's Anatomy. He then catches up with friend Taylor (finally)...and Taylor proceeds to beat the crap out of him too, by kicking him in the face and chest, strangling him, shoving his back into cell bars with long sharp spikes sticking out, mercilessly stepping on his face, strangling him some more and delivering some shattering right hooks to the jaw (all under mind control, of course). After the fight, instead of friendly gossip, they realize they're about 100 yards away from an active bomb, not just any old bomb, but THE Doomsday Bomb. And they're trapped inside a locked cell. And an army of Militia Apes are attacking!  Finally... escape! but Nova ain't coming. Back to the church, Brent witnesses Taylor (after spending the whole movie trying to locate him) get fatally shot, knows he's now alone and goes on a one man kamikaze assault with his one puny rifle against 100 gorilla sub machine guns. And if that ain't enough, THEN he runs out of ammo! And he doesn't even get the satisfaction of seeing Taylor's final efforts. What happens to him is what you'd want to see happen to the worst of villains, but not to the heroic character. After all this, it would have been better to stay in bed.That aside, Planet of the Apes WAS a tough act to follow. Beneath the Planet of the Apes cinematography does border on spectacle and alot of credit should go to director Ted Post for getting alot more out of the half baked premise and limitations he was trapped in. Many still frames and action sequences from the film are just as epic-like, colorful and bizarre that is on par with (and in many instances, exceeds) the original; but the editing in the original surpasses the sequel!(not Ted's fault). Still...Beneath's camera angles are far superior than any of the sequels that followed. Composer Leornard Rosenman created a very eerie, foreboding music score that touches on some semblance to Jerry Goldsmith's music from the original, while taking it into a different direction that effectively captures the mood of the film that works perfectly. It's unavoidable that both Planet and Beneath... have a flavor of their own considering all obstacles, so it's appropriate that the both scores follow suit in different scales; they're both brilliant.Charlton Heston can't be blamed for his lack of enthusiasm, considering what he was presented with. If a more fuller and better continuation of the story was better fleshed out...who knows (after all, look at his lone survivor interpretation from The Omega Man, not far removed from his position at the end of Planet...). But a more diversified storyline was necessary that needed splitting the story between Taylor and the Apes which changed the flow of what followed previously...because the first movie was presented subjectively through the eyes of Taylor. The addition of the new elements that carried the narrative forward was not going to be consistent with director Franklin Schaffner's original subjective approach to the first Apes that made it so successful. So it's very appropriate that James Franciscus' 'Brent' is allowed to discover Ape City because the Apes are one of the main reason people would want to return to the story anyway. The other reason is Taylor! (and Nova).  And that is the main problem. Because, NO sequel was ever planned for Planet of the Apes! If a storyline was preplanned then this may have paralleled author Pierre Boulle's excellent 'Bridge on the River Kwai' more closely if additional characters were already evident, like the way the story in 'Kwai' continued after William Holden escapes from the prison camp (as Heston did from Ape City) while the events flipped back and forth between Holden's increasing dilemma and that of Alec Guiness' misguided actions. Sadly, (because it's only 1967 before sequels were recognized as obvious cash cows) 'Planet...' didn't have the luxury of foresight of the epic possibilities that could have logically continued the story forward in the same care and quality. Thus we're left with a more emphasis on action orientation, less on character growth and a more speedy presentation that's intended to camouflage the story's inadequacy.It's almost easy to say that Beneath... is better appreciated on its own merit, as an almost separate entity from Planet... because of its radical introduction to science fiction elements new to the story.

It's a story about two adult sons, a real one and an adopted one, both doomed, and one son, a 12-year-old boy, whose opening and closing voiceovers show he survives his criminal childhood to lead a peaceful honest life.For all its killing, `The Road to Perdition' has a silent center where we see Paul Newman and Tom Hanks staring at each other &#150; two powerful actors we never quite expected to see in the same frame.  This inspired casting is among the chief interests of the movie. They're an odd pair, Newman's face as chiseled and handsome as ever at 77; Hanks' pudgy mug screwed up, twisted and ugly as Yasir Arafat's.  There's an excellent supporting cast Tyler Hoechlin as the boy always expressive with few words, Daniel Craig as Rooney's (Newman's) evil son suitably weak and disgusting, Jennifer Jason Leigh convincing if only seen for moments as Sullivan's wife, Jude Law as the assassin-photographer Harlen Mcguire providing one of his energetic character turns, this one more repugnant than any he's taken on before. Hanks too has hardly ever played a guy as bad as this.  Nitti as played by Stanley Tucci is more boring than his accountant, but so it may have been.This is a stoical, somehow empty, Depression era world.  At times it seems the period is evoked almost entirely (aside from the heavy, dark clothes) by the frequent presence of lots of old cars.  For someone as outgoingly sweet and soulful as Hanks the projection of non-stop self-control is awesome, and Newman's authoritative speeches are fun to watch.  But the fact is things are getting very flat by the time Jude Law finally appears to perk up the action with a bit of menacing oddity and ghoulishness as a professional photographer of dead people who sometimes doubles as their killer, and who now gets hired as a hit man to snuff Sullivan.  Law provides colorful moments, but even he is held in check.  The violent finale, as well as the road sequence, may awaken memories of `Bonnie and Clyde,' but `Road to Perdition' has none of Arthur Penn's rich character development or flashy staging.The premise is more complicated than just Michael Sullivan Junior witnessing a murder and all hell breaking loose.  There's an interesting inherent conflict between the `good' Sullivans, Michael senior (Hanks), forced to become a hit man because Rooney (Newman) has adopted him and given him a home, and Michael junior, his son, also `good' (on the one hand), and the knowingly wicked Rooney and his bad seed offspring, Conner (on the other).  This makes for a study in contrasts that might have been worked out quite differently, particularly if the road sequence had been omitted and there had been more direct interaction between the men.Perhaps because the movie focuses on these two sets of fathers and sons and there's little dramatic elaboration of other relationships within the gang &#150; of the heavy ties that bind together a larger criminal `family' or community &#150; there isn't that pervasive mood of sublime melancholy, the sense that everyone in the whole enterprise is intertwined and doomed, that makes the Godfather trilogy seem an epic and that ennobles smaller efforts like James Gray's `The Yards.'  Instead there's a quality of emotional stinginess, of clean and potent darkness  `Road to Perdition' has an elegant and somewhat cold look, a feeling of carrying off the feat of doing the gangster movie thing once again and in a new way &#150; but at some cost.  `Road to Perdition' strives for freshness and class and it achieves them.  However, it does so by giving up some of the more commonplace pleasures of down and dirty gangster action and emotional warmth.The minimal dialogue, apart from a few grand speeches, makes us do the work of supplying feelings for these surprisingly repressed Irishmen.  Did Thirties people have almost no vocabulary? If so, how did they manage to become so talky in time for &#145;Forties film noir?Hanks' performance is a remarkable feat of repression.  We see this warm good-natured man holding back all his natural feelings of humanity and goodness to become, or at least seem to be, a trained killer.  The effect is very intense.  He constantly seems about to implode. Nevertheless this Method acting doesn't really work because Hanks succeeds only in appearing stern, not cruel.  There's no killer there, and when he, as Sullivan, mows down old Rooney and his men, it's understandable that it's done in a cool, elegant long shot so we don't see his face.Certainly `American Beauty' seemed to touch a nerve at the time; a lot of it may have been that Kevin Spacey, at the center of it, was born to play the role of Lester Burnham.  It's clear from this second effort that Sam Mendes can be relied on to put together a finely crafted movie we will want to go out and see, and that cinematographer Conrad Hall is a more than worthy collaborator.  At times Conrad Hall almost plays the dominant role here.  It's not so clear that Mr. Mendes has a point of view.

To those who have not yet seen the movie, (yes, there may be a few) it was set (and filmed) in snowy Minnesota, which give the film an authentic small town feel that the talented set designers of Hollywood would be hard pressed to duplicate.  From the stars' first lines in the film ('Morning ****head, Hello moron) we know what to expect, and the movie doesn't disappoint us. The verbal sparring between Max and John continues non-stop through 100+ laugh filled minutes.  Both the plot and the ending are not quite believable, but who really cares? For those who want reality, there are many depressing films out there, not to mention the news- papers and CNN. I have never read if all the cast members were the first choices for the parts, but every one of the cast fits their roles perfectly.  Ann-Margret has evolved from her dancing, grinding sexpot image in the 60's to a wonderful, natural actress. Burgess Meredith....what can I say?  He's perfect as John's father, a crusty, lovable old man.  The interplay between Jack and Burgess is so easy, and why not?  Who better to play a 94 year old than the 80+ year old Meredith. While Burgess is lovable, Daryl Hannah is lovely. As John's daughter Melanie, I have never seen her look more beautiful and heart-melting as she does in this picture.  Ozzie Davis, Kevin Pollak, and Buck Henry round out the cast, and bring their many talents to the picture. While much has been written about the comedy, very little is said about the realistic side of  Grumpy Old Men.  There are a few fleeting scenes that reveal the heartache and loneliness of growing old.  And John's dealings with the I.R.S. in the movie, while hilarious, points out what can happen when the machine-like IRS process starts to roll over an individual not caring about the human-real life side of the situation. The only downer for me in again watching this movie is the knowlege that the string is over.  Walter and Jack and Burgess are gone.  I can't watch this movie without feeling just a tinge of sorrow.  When most actors their age pass on, we feel sorrow, and then watch their classics from decades ago.  With Walter and Jack the best was yet to come. I have read elsewhere that scripts were in the works for Grumpy Old Men 3  and Odd Couple 3.  Who knows how many more successful films this brilliant team could have made together.  I doubt if the formula for their success would have grown stale, because both Walter and Jack no longer acted....their roles where just an extension of themselves.Whether it be Grumpy or Grumpier Old Men, Odd Couple II, or Out to Sea we were as much visiting with old friends as we were watching a movie.  Old friends get more endearing with age, and we would have never tired of new visits from them, no matter what the role.

I remember it chiefly for it's almost pastoral sequences where the aging, war-weary gangster can indulge in some fleeting tranquility (even fun) before the violence inherent in his life plays itself out.  Kitano uses the rigidly hierarchical and stylized sub-universe of the Yakuza as his canvas.  The British director Sam Mendes, seeking a similar canvas for his purposes, wisely chose to set his movie during the Depression, this country's last great mythical era, and to put it in the Midwest with its big skies and vast expanses of land, a milieu whose emptiness seems somehow not liberating but crushingly claustrophobic.  This is the land that God forgot, as a high-school prof of mine cheerfully put it, and other talented directors (such as Terence Malick in Badlands and Days of Heaven) have put it to similar use.  Mendes also feeds the myth about some kind of Irish Mafia as a counterpart to the Italian one; we saw this also in the Coens' Miller's Crossing and Walter Hill's Last Man Standing and elsewhere. (Let me just take a moment about that sure there were Irish-American gangsters during the Depression, and beforehand, and afterwards, and presently.  The Westies in Manhattan had the most notoriety recently. But these were strictly neighborhood enterprises.  Al Capone in Chicago crushed his competitors, Irish or otherwise, most notably in the St Valentine's Day Massacre.  Irish hit-men worked for Italian bosses, such as Vincent Mad Dog Coll, who probably inspired the character played by Tom Hanks.  But it's fashionable to posit an Irish Mafia, maybe since the Irish, unlike the Italians, don't seem hugely concerned how they get depicted in movies\/TV.)I won't dwell on the movie's plot, partly because there's very little of it.  Suffice it to say it's about betrayal and revenge.  As with the ancient Greek tragedies, all the bad things that happen seem preordained.  (I once heard this distinction between Greek tragedy & Christian tragedy Greek What a shame it had to be this way; Christian What a shame it was this way when it could have been some other way.)  If there's a weakness in the plot, it seems to be in what drives Hanks' character to revenge.  He seems not very interested in anything in life beyond his job as a Mob enforcer; with his family he's not so much a father as a father figure.  He plays the part.  Once disaster strikes, we see how much his family actually meant to him; afterward, one would think he would either (a) devote his life to his older son's well-being, stifling his bloodlust if need be, or (b) stash his son safely away somewhere, and THEN go off on his rampage.  But this movie wants to do both.  Well, okay, that's Hollywood.It does lead to some nice screen moments, such as Hanks teaching his son to drive, which was probably my favorite sequence, reminding me of the one occasion in my life when I tried to drive a stick-shift car.  There's also a gorgeous scene where Hanks & his son discuss their previous life, such as school.  I liked the bible stories, says the son, Peter was good at math.  We see the stricken look on Hanks' face as he realizes he never even knew his own family; their lives were unfolding under his nose.  I imagine a lot of fathers could relate to that (I'm not one myself). Hanks will probably cop his third Oscar for this part, or at least a nomination.  I think this is his favorite performance of mine (I haven't seen them all, such as the Seattle or castaway movies) along with his manic comedian (I forget what that movie was called) & the guy in The Money Pit.  Freed from needing to be likeable, he can just be the character here.  He stays beautifully within his character's emotional range, just as Billy Bob Thornton always does.  This requires EXTREME discipline for an actor.  (Supposedly, crying on cue is hard--especially for a male actor--but I think NOT crying is harder.  If you're human, you can cry, especially since Method took over.)  Hanks is masterful here, immaculate.  Not a word, not a glance, not a gesture is wrong.  He even did something with his eyes that was perfect for the part--not sure how to describe it.  The rest of the cast more than held up their end.  I've never been much of a Paul Newman fan, but here he does something like what Jack Lemmon did in Glengarry Glen Ross--takes his lifelong annoying mannerisms & fuses them together & subjugates them into a real character.  He didn't even succumb to the temptation to pepper his character with Sure-now-me-lad Oirish bullbleep.  (Maybe Mendes helped keep that at bay?)  Jennifer Jason Leigh made the most of her 3 seconds of screen time; not sure why she even took the part, there's so little to do; but we remember her throughout, as presumably Hanks does, so that helps the cause.  Stanley Tucci as Frank Nitti is just a little too suave for my liking, maybe he's just played too many gangsters.  (The real Nitti committed suicide in 1936.)  The kids were, well, you know, kids, what can I say.  Standout part--Jude Law as the photo creep--where the heck have I seen him before?  Have to admit I haven't seen American Beauty--although I may want to rent it now--so this is the first I've seen of Mendes' directing.  Good job, maintains a very haunting elegiac quality throughout although maybe leans a little bit too far towards Less is More.  Could've used just a bit harder of an edge; it's possible to do that & maintain the dreamlike quality, v. Sugar Hill or anything by David Lynch.  I haven't read critics' reviews yet but I imagine they'll like a certain scene & it's use of sound effects--or let's say, it's non-use--& I liked it too, but just for the record, it's been done before, I think The Big Combo (1955) was the earliest. Also liked the flowing bank robberies sequence, even if it called attention to itself somewhat.

So, spot on, Sam, there's a good bloke.  I just thought the finale was a little corny, but hey--maybe they thought the audience deserved a break after the previous darkness,  or what passes for such out in Tinseltown.

Minor complaint we were informed at the beginning & reminded at the end this took place over the winter of 1931--but aside from an early sequence in some light snow, not much inclement weather appeared, aside from some rain.

Now I have. This is one of those classics whose status has been fading with time, and it's no wonder once you've seen the film. Sure, there are a few scenes that are very memorable, and have become part of our common culture. Who can forget the scenes where Judah Ben-Hur is a slave in the galleys, rowing fiercely as the weaker slaves collapse around him? The music in this scene is what I find particularly memorable. And then there's the chariot race, which I think cements this film as one that is worth seeing more than any other. I also like how the story is constructed, as a side story to the life of Jesus. Christ pops up every once in a while. Early in the film, there is a memorable scene where Christ defies a Roman soldier and gives the parched Ben-Hur water. When the soldier tries to reprimand him, a quick look from Jesus silences him completely. Unfortunately, a whole hell of a lot of the film is very forgettable. Each scene seems to take 25% longer than it really needs to &#150; not only are the scenes protracted far beyond their limitations, but the actors stumble slowly through their lines, as if each and every syllable was carrying the cross on its back. It gets old, and quick. The film has very little passion as it lumbers along. Most of the direction seems lackluster. Big, but mostly lacking heart. William Wyler directed one of the most emotionally touching films of all time, Mrs. Miniver, an utterly intimate affair that will stay with me forever. Ben-Hur often just sat there without trying to connect to the audience at all. The acting itself is generally weak. Charlton Heston's performance is certainly not among his best. I actually like him as an actor, but I don't think it's very good here. To be fair, his performance gets better as the film moves along. Ben-Hur's moral dilemma is intriguing, and as his desire for revenge and violence did ultimately touch me. Many of the other performances are just bad &#150; the one that comes immediately to mind is Haya Harareet as Esther, the slave girl whom Ben-Hur loves and later marries. Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell, who play his mother and sister respectively, are too dull to really care too much what happens to them. And I'm disappointed in Sam Jaffe, whom I love as an actor in films such as The Scarlet Empress and Gunga Din. I didn't even recognize him, he has so little energy in this film. Hugh Griffith won an Oscar for playing a sheik, but his character is not memorable at all. The only actor who really hits a home run is Stephen Boyd as Messala, Ben-Hur's childhood friend, now his bitterest enemy. He really projects his inner turmoil. Overall, I say that I am glad that I saw this finally. It may have not worked very well, but I was generally entertained. Not moved at all, but it was nice to watch (and a lot more fun to criticize!). Only the chariot sequence and a couple of Messala's scenes did anything more than that for me. 6\/10.

Hugh Griffith won an Oscar for playing a sheik, but his character is not memorable at all. The only actor who really hits a home run is Stephen Boyd as Messala, Ben-Hur's childhood friend, now his bitterest enemy. He really projects his inner turmoil. Overall, I say that I am glad that I saw this finally. It may have not worked very well, but I was generally entertained. Not moved at all, but it was nice to watch (and a lot more fun to criticize!). Only the chariot sequence and a couple of Messala's scenes did anything more than that for me. 6\/10.

Now I have. This is one of those classics whose status has been fading with time, and it's no wonder once you've seen the film. Sure, there are a few scenes that are very memorable, and have become part of our common culture. Who can forget the scenes where Judah Ben-Hur is a slave in the galleys, rowing fiercely as the weaker slaves collapse around him? The music in this scene is what I find particularly memorable. And then there's the chariot race, which I think cements this film as one that is worth seeing more than any other. I also like how the story is constructed, as a side story to the life of Jesus. Christ pops up every once in a while. Early in the film, there is a memorable scene where Christ defies a Roman soldier and gives the parched Ben-Hur water. When the soldier tries to reprimand him, a quick look from Jesus silences him completely. Unfortunately, a whole hell of a lot of the film is very forgettable. Each scene seems to take 25% longer than it really needs to &#150; not only are the scenes protracted far beyond their limitations, but the actors stumble slowly through their lines, as if each and every syllable was carrying the cross on its back. It gets old, and quick. The film has very little passion as it lumbers along. Most of the direction seems lackluster. Big, but mostly lacking heart. William Wyler directed one of the most emotionally touching films of all time, Mrs. Miniver, an utterly intimate affair that will stay with me forever. Ben-Hur often just sat there without trying to connect to the audience at all. The acting itself is generally weak. Charlton Heston's performance is certainly not among his best. I actually like him as an actor, but I don't think it's very good here. To be fair, his performance gets better as the film moves along. Ben-Hur's moral dilemma is intriguing, and as his desire for revenge and violence did ultimately touch me.

The principal occupants of the region are Native Americans and a great diversity of wild life... It is the third year of the war between French and British, for the possession of the continent, somewhere on the frontier west of the Hudson River... The Mohicans are allied with the British while their old enemies the Hurons side with the French... There, three men roam the forest making their living as frontier trappers and scouts... The first is Hawkeye, a superb frontiersman raised by the Mohawk, who can reload and fire a flintlock at full run; the second is his adopted father Chingachgook, the last of the Mohicans, and the third, his brother Uncas, 'a warrior swift and straight as an arrow shot in the sun.'This trio seems have nothing to do with the early Colonial wars, until they come upon the vengeful Magwa and his Huron war party as they attempt to slaughter the Munro sisters, Cora and Alice, heading with a small regiment of redcoats to meet up with their father, Colonel Munro, at Fort William Henry...Eventually, the compassionate Mohican family comes to the rescue with a spectacular style of fighting... The film takes full advantage of their graphic capabilities with incredibly fast and fluid fighting action and mind-blowing attack moves... Shortly thereafter, two love stories take place... The three men lead the survivors to the English fort besieged by French forces and their Huron allies... The siege is a grand affair of roaring nighttime cannon and mortar attacks...Michael Mann's historical romance film gives a realistic picture of the frontier life, and a vivid impression of the horrors of warfare in the wilderness at the time where the combatants often had time for one shot before being overpowered and reduced to hand-to-hand fierce combat... The movie is filled with scenes of incredible, brutal violence... It's warfare at a primal level... Academy Award Winner Daniel Day Lewis also known as The long rifle is splendid as Hawkeye, the legendary warrior who encourages the Colonial militia to desert... He agrees to surrender in exchange for the life of two sisters and one British officer... He vows romantically to Cora that he will find her no matter how long it takes, no matter how far...Madeleine Stowe manages to find in Cora's fiery character a balance between sensitivity and strength... War and tragedy swirl around her as she struggles to protect her man... Cora's attraction grows for the soft-spoken warrior, who shows marked differences when compared to Major Heyward...Jodhi May is the blonde Alice, Cora's younger timid sister... By that long shot of her innocent face - a portrait of extreme torment and despair - we are all aware of her sufferings... We sense more pain than she can cope with... May has almost no lines, but her eyes, brimming with tears, are saying everything... No matter how much she wants to remain standing, she was retreating further and further from the ugly face of Magua... Her heart was crying out in anger... We all know that she will do anything than surrender... Her breakdown turns the scene into a willpower for revenge..Russell Means is powerful as the Mohican elder Chingachgook... His running battle along that majestic ridge is some of the finest film-making we've seen in terms of action and intensity... There is no dialog in these moments but the scene leaves us certainly breathless.. Wes Studi is Magua, the infamous Huron Indian who always speaks of himself in the third person... He is fluent in English, French, and Huron... Magua is a strong, vibrant villain consumed with hatred... Magua plots the massacre of the retreating troops, their women and children... Eric Schweig is Hawkeye's gentle and valiant brother Uncas... His quiet tenderness for Alice adds emotional weight to what could be passionate and unique... He asserts his mythic stature in a battle on a mountain top with Magua, not only to determine the winner in a struggle between good and evil, but also to decide the destiny of a race...Steven Waddington is the last survivor of a troop of English soldiers caught by France's Indian allies... He is a jealous and snobbish officer who wants the radiant Cora at any price... Heyward brings some realistic touches of duality, showing his courage with one life-saving act...Maurice Roëves seems impotent as Munroe... His blindness to the realities of honor brings destruction... Patrice Chéreau is the French General Montcalm who gives Magua the go ahead to attack Munro's retreating army... He begs Munrow not to sign the death warrant of so many, and promises safe passage for the English so long as they return to England and fight no more on the continent...The real inspiration of 'The Last of the Mohicans' is the extraordinary action sequences, the intensity of its music, and the exotic romanticism of such 1930's adventures as 'Charge of the Light Brigade', 'Gunga Din', and 'The Lives of a Bengal Lancer', where unshaken heroes never hesitate in the face of savage adversaries...Michael Mann's camera exploits the beauty of the North Carolina mysterious Smoky Mountains, its verdant forests, and its white-water rapids and waterfalls... The opening shot of the fog misting through the Smokies are enough to take your breath away...

The principal occupants of the region are Native Americans and a great diversity of wild life... It is the third year of the war between French and British, for the possession of the continent, somewhere on the frontier west of the Hudson River... The Mohicans are allied with the British while their old enemies the Hurons side with the French... There, three men roam the forest making their living as frontier trappers and scouts... The first is Hawkeye, a superb frontiersman raised by the Mohawk, who can reload and fire a flintlock at full run; the second is his adopted father Chingachgook, the last of the Mohicans, and the third, his brother Uncas, 'a warrior swift and straight as an arrow shot in the sun.'This trio seems have nothing to do with the early Colonial wars, until they come upon the vengeful Magwa and his Huron war party as they attempt to slaughter the Munro sisters, Cora and Alice, heading with a small regiment of redcoats to meet up with their father, Colonel Munro, at Fort William Henry...Eventually, the compassionate Mohican family comes to the rescue with a spectacular style of fighting... The film takes full advantage of their graphic capabilities with incredibly fast and fluid fighting action and mind-blowing attack moves... Shortly thereafter, two love stories take place... The three men lead the survivors to the English fort besieged by French forces and their Huron allies... The siege is a grand affair of roaring nighttime cannon and mortar attacks...Michael Mann's historical romance film gives a realistic picture of the frontier life, and a vivid impression of the horrors of warfare in the wilderness at the time where the combatants often had time for one shot before being overpowered and reduced to hand-to-hand fierce combat... The movie is filled with scenes of incredible, brutal violence... It's warfare at a primal level... Academy Award Winner Daniel Day Lewis also known as The long rifle is splendid as Hawkeye, the legendary warrior who encourages the Colonial militia to desert... He agrees to surrender in exchange for the life of two sisters and one British officer... He vows romantically to Cora that he will find her no matter how long it takes, no matter how far...Madeleine Stowe manages to find in Cora's fiery character a balance between sensitivity and strength... War and tragedy swirl around her as she struggles to protect her man...

The acting was typical of a monster action movie (some actors very over the top, others flat and emotionless).  While the story had an interesting premise, the writers failed to explain several crucial plot points, instead making vague reference to them in the newspaper clipping\/voice-over montage at the start of the film.  Thankfully, I had read an in-depth summary written by someone with access to the script ahead of time, and was able to explain to my companions what was going on. ***Warning - Spoilers!***First off, the dragons subsided on ash created when they burned things. The film didn't say this, and so the scene at the orchard made little sense. People were asking Why didn't the dragon eat them? and the only explanation that we were given was Quinn saying something like He doesn't want us, he only wants the ash from the plants. Secondly, we never found out how one male dragon was able to multiply into millions.  It was presumed that there may have been eggs also in hibernation, but this was never stated.  It also seemed strange that Van Zan would say that the male could fertilize 100 000 eggs, and yet not one of these 100 000 eggs would hatch another male.  Finally, it would seem that for the dragons to have taken over the entire planet, there would have to be hundreds, even thousands of other males from around the world.But those flaws aside, the movie was quite entertaining, although not a thinking person's film.  6\/10   ","genre":null},{"date":"14 July 2002","score":"","review":"  Reign of Fire gave me exactly what I expected it to - some reasonable action, a hole-ridden plot, and lots of gratuitous explosions.
