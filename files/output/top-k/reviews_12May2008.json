In charge of this transfer operation is David Langley (Peter MacNicol) who ask to the Royal National Gallery of London if they can send one of their employers to introduce the painting in Los Angeles. In the old Continent we have that now Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) has a job at the Royal National Gallery but everybody there hates him, except the president. So the president is agree when everybody wants that Bean travels to America for some months, of course for the introduction of the Whistler's Mother. Now Mr. Bean is in Hollywood where everybody thinks that he is an erudite expert in art and also a doctor.That is the plot of the first feature film of Mr. Bean, released almost 11 years ago. I watched it for the very first time when I was very young when my father rented the VHS because my family loved the TV series. Over the past years Mr. Bean has become one of those shows that even if you already watched all the episodes (in this case there are only 14 episodes) every time that is on TV is just easy to watch it again and again and of course is also very easy to have a really funny and enjoyable time with this magnificent show. But for an odd reason this film was almost forgotten in Mexico, even that was a total success when it was released. This film wasn't available on DVD and I don't remember well the film itself. I only remember pretty well the very last scene with Bean and the original painting. But this year was finally released the Region 4 DVD and yesterday I get it in a double pack with Johnny English ( a film that I didn't like very much when I saw it in the theaters but definitely soon I'm going to give it one more chance) for only $9!Anyway, after watching again Bean now I can say that is really funny and probably the second best work of Rowan Atkinson, of course just behind the original Mr. Bean show. I must say that Bean looks really strange out of his original environment so I definitely understand of the critics to film saying that they didn't respect the fact that Mr. Bean is always the center of all the plots. Here is not just Mr. Bean and the first part of the film puts David as a man whose work depends on that painting so he want to be really good with Mr. Bean so he invites him to stay in his own home. That makes more difficult these days for David, now with all of his family angry and with his wife trying to abandon him. Bean in this part has some really funny moments and definitely is not what the people of Los Angeles expected. But that is just OK compared to the part after the final appearance of the painting. I feel a strange sensation every time Bean is near the painting just for imagine of the things that may happen. Of course the worst happens and the new face of the mother is really brilliant.The film's runtime is only about 82 minutes so after that we don't have a lot more, just the little performance of Burt Reynolds in my favourite scene of the film, of course for the great speech of Bean that is even kind of moving. The last sequence at the hospital at first looks just as excess and maybe to forced just to put Bean as a real doctor. But in the end is just as funny as satisfactory just like the last two hilarious scenes (Bean making finger to everyone and with the original painting) and also after the credits there is another hilarious moment with Bean.Conclusion Bean is just hilarious at times and just funny at others but I think that the fans of the show will have an enjoyable time with this film. By the way I didn't like the cover versions of Yesterday and Stuck in the Middle With You.

By chance McCord discovers what has happened & takes it upon himself to stop Foss & prevent him killing the Vice President, thousands of innocent spectators & his children...Directed by Peter Hymas who was also the director of photography one has to say Sudden Death is one of my favourite action flicks from the 90's. You know I have always liked JCVD & think he's made some great films, yes that's right I just said I think JCVD has made some great films since I truly believe that. He isn't the greatest actor of all time but he does at least try, he has always kept himself in shape & certainly makes for a plausible action hero & most of his films have something about them. From his early low budget roots in Bloodsport (1988) & Kickboxer (1989) which were fun films to his big budget Hollywood hey day with entertaining films like Universal Soldier (1992), Hard Target (1993) & Timecop (1994) to his more recent output like the interesting Replicant (2001) & In Hell (2003) which deserved more than to go straight to video. For my money Sudden Death ties with Hard Target as JCVD's best film, sure it's an unashamed Die Hard (1988) rip-off but if you can get over that & take it for what it is it's great action packed entertainment all the way. The script by Gene Quintano could have easily been made as a Die Hard film & not looked out of place, there's the cold hearted bad guy, there's the plan to take control of some location & cut it off from the outside world, there's the lone ranger style hero who has to do it all on his own against the odds while his family get caught up in the situation which makes things personal for him, there's enough dead bodies to fill a graveyard, there's plenty of shoot-outs, fights, gratuitous violence, one liners (I love the one by Boothe who when trying to select a hostage to kill says 'you all agree the Mayor's wife has been the most annoying' after she started crying), plenty of explosions & a few plot twists as well. It's all here, it really is. It moves along at a good pace, your never more than a few minutes away from the next action set-piece, the character's are good, the dialogue fine & the plot sound. There's nothing ground breaking in Sudden Death, it is what it is, an action packed 100 odd minutes & to me a near prefect action packed 100 odd minutes.Director Hyams turns in a really good film with plenty of style, some of the aerial shots of the Civic Arena are great & have real scope & a sense of scale when the film is viewed in it's proper 2351 widescreen ratio & his camera is always moving looking for nice angles. The action is often spectacular, from fights on top of the Arena to explosions to rocket launchers to shoot-outs to fights to death defying leaps to helicopter crashes. McCord also turns into McGuyver on a few occasions as he fixes up some home made weapons including bombs & a DIY gun that shoots nails. I loved the commentators as well as we keep cutting back to them & their over enthusiastic comments like 'I don't care if your packing heat you couldn't get in here tonight'! Living in the UK I know next to nothing about Ice Hockey so I really don't know if Sudden Death is an accurate representation of the rules & the sport in general terms although I don't see why it wouldn't be. The film is very violent in places with head-buts, punches, kicks, all manner of items used as makeshift weapons, a huge body count, people are set on fire, shot & stabbed amongst other things.With a supposed budget of about $35,000,000 Sudden Death had a decent budget but it's not up there with the hundred million plus Hollywood blockbusters is it? The film is very well made with high production values, top notch stunt work & good special effects. Shot mainly on location in Pittsburgh. The acting is fine with JCVD phoning in his performance & only turning up to the set to do the stunt work, Boothe makes for a great villain while even the two kids aren't that annoying.Sudden Death is one of my favourite 90's action films, it's action packed with a wide variety of over the top action scenes, it has a great villain & a suitably silly plot that you can't take too seriously.

Given that the film won the Oscar for best foreign film and earned numerous accolades from the major critics (Siskel and Ebert raved about the film on their show), one would have expected to see it on DVD a long time ago, but alas, it's coming now and getting the proper treatment.The film is set in Macedonia in the early 90s, as tensions between the 'native' Macedonians and Muslim Albanians flare. The story is broken into 3 parts &#150; words, faces, and pictures. Words follows a young monk, on a vow of silence for the last 2 years. He finds to his shock one evening in his quarters a young boy hiding in his bed. He runs to tell one of the monastery heads, but decides against telling after seeing the fear in the boy's eyes. The next day, armed men show up looking for an Albanian girl who allegedly killed a sheep herder. No one knows of the girl, but the armed men refuse to leave and keep watch in case she turns up. That night, the young Monk, Kiril, wakes to see the boy again, but this time in the light of the moon, and realizes that it is not a boy, but a girl with her hair chopped off. She is Zamira. He allows her to hide with him, only to be discovered later in the night by the other priests. The two are forced out under the cover of darkness, wished well on their way. The two seem to be heading for love, but that love will be swiftly and brutally taken away from them before it is allowed to materialize.Part 2, faces, takes us into the modern hubbub of London, where a woman at a photo agency, Anne, is embroiled in pregnancy and an affair with her Macedonian Co-worker, Aleksander (Rade Serbedzija). He has just returned from an expedition which has apparently traumatized him. His camera has killed a man he says. He asks her to come back to Macedonia with him, where he remembers life as peaceful and safe, despite her warnings and knowledge of the Balkan conflicts. Being pregnant, she cannot go, she must meet with her husband. Aleksander leaves alone to return to his homeland. While the war seems far away from bustling London, violence and hatred are never as far as they seem. Over dinner, Anne first tells her husband she is pregnant, it's his, and she wants a divorce. Meanwhile, a waiter and a patron, both speaking Macedonian, bicker. The tension in the scene is wrought, as Anne struggles to get the right words out and express her feelings and the two men head toward a devastating act of violence for Anne and her Husband.Part 3, pictures, returns us to Macedonia, and to Aleksander. He arrives home and finds his old home a disaster, and finds that his Albanian neighbours are fearful of him. Childhood friends are now bitter enemies, hatred runs hot between Macedonians and Albanians. Some in his family seem to be somewhat sympathetic, others militant, such as his cousin, Mitre, one of the armed men at the church in the beginning of the film. Aleksander inquires about Hana, a woman he used to love, and apparently still does. She is Albanian, widowed, and off limits. He goes to visit her, and finds that he must pass a roadblock, where he is suspiciously questioned by armed villagers. He is allowed in only after Hana's father confirms his identity. We discover that the man is Zamira's grandfather, and she is Hana's daughter. Aleksander will be asked later by Hana to help protect Zamira.I will not reveal here the interconnectedness of the film, as it is impossible to do so without revealing major spoilers. We come to realize however that the film is not linear in nature, but circular, a style employed in a much different film at the same time, Pulp Fiction. We also come to realize that there a number of subtle incongruence's in the plot. People who should be dead are alive - timing and events seem to be off.

The circularity of violence is manifested through the circularity of the plot things don't always look the same but the result always is destruction of life. Before the Rain is a film about our humanity and how it is destroyed by hate; how we are not only willing to destroy those we hate because we hate them, but that we will destroy those we love when they stand in the way of our hatreds. The film is a scathing indictment of the policies of war and hate, rendered through the heart and soul of art.

Given that the film won the Oscar for best foreign film and earned numerous accolades from the major critics (Siskel and Ebert raved about the film on their show), one would have expected to see it on DVD a long time ago, but alas, it's coming now and getting the proper treatment.The film is set in Macedonia in the early 90s, as tensions between the 'native' Macedonians and Muslim Albanians flare. The story is broken into 3 parts &#150; words, faces, and pictures. Words follows a young monk, on a vow of silence for the last 2 years. He finds to his shock one evening in his quarters a young boy hiding in his bed. He runs to tell one of the monastery heads, but decides against telling after seeing the fear in the boy's eyes. The next day, armed men show up looking for an Albanian girl who allegedly killed a sheep herder. No one knows of the girl, but the armed men refuse to leave and keep watch in case she turns up. That night, the young Monk, Kiril, wakes to see the boy again, but this time in the light of the moon, and realizes that it is not a boy, but a girl with her hair chopped off. She is Zamira. He allows her to hide with him, only to be discovered later in the night by the other priests. The two are forced out under the cover of darkness, wished well on their way. The two seem to be heading for love, but that love will be swiftly and brutally taken away from them before it is allowed to materialize.Part 2, faces, takes us into the modern hubbub of London, where a woman at a photo agency, Anne, is embroiled in pregnancy and an affair with her Macedonian Co-worker, Aleksander (Rade Serbedzija). He has just returned from an expedition which has apparently traumatized him. His camera has killed a man he says. He asks her to come back to Macedonia with him, where he remembers life as peaceful and safe, despite her warnings and knowledge of the Balkan conflicts. Being pregnant, she cannot go, she must meet with her husband. Aleksander leaves alone to return to his homeland. While the war seems far away from bustling London, violence and hatred are never as far as they seem. Over dinner, Anne first tells her husband she is pregnant, it's his, and she wants a divorce.

Ashes to ashes, dirt to dirt, mess to mess, trash to trash. You can always make it a joke. But that kind of regeneration and rejuvenation through and via blood, blood, and blood again, war, war and war again is unworthy of a human mind, particularly of four human minds, those of the Marx Siblings who are more underlings than siblings in that line of inspiration. That's not the best film of these comedians and clowns and the subtlety of the discourse is definitely too fine for me to understand it, I guess, not to say appreciate it.

And since we are on that line, the line of compassion, sympathy and empathy, meditate on this one. The workers of Freedonia are demanding shorter hours. Isn't that social? But the answer of the newly appointed Roman tyrant is astounding. We'll start by cutting their lunch hour to twenty minutes. Who said that the Marx Brothers were not social-minded? Where are the liars? To produce such humor in 1933 is quite prophetic, prophetic of a catastrophe coming up the road. When the creative intelligentsia of a country is able to bring together in one of their comedies both racist remarks and anti-labor slogans you can be sure this country is doomed to die a difficult death and definitely labor hard and painfully to give birth and deliver the next phase of its history. The next phase will require fifty millions of dead people, victims and bodies to find some regeneration. A lot worse than all the human sacrifices of the Aztecs or the Mayas. The western world, when they do things in the bloody line, they know how to inundate the earth and the soil and the fields with good warm human blood and fertilize the crops with hot human ashes. Ashes to ashes, dirt to dirt, mess to mess, trash to trash. You can always make it a joke. But that kind of regeneration and rejuvenation through and via blood, blood, and blood again, war, war and war again is unworthy of a human mind, particularly of four human minds, those of the Marx Siblings who are more underlings than siblings in that line of inspiration. That's not the best film of these comedians and clowns and the subtlety of the discourse is definitely too fine for me to understand it, I guess, not to say appreciate it. They might have been better inspired to wait for Charles Chaplin to come with his Dictator and let this other comedian use real humane humor to debunk the tyrant. But that was many light years ahead of their antics. That was the last time the four siblings were together on the same screen. Zeppo Marx was to get out of the band or gang after this duck soup that killed the ducks for sure but produced no delicatessen soup.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines ","genre":"Comedy, Musical, War"},{"date":"12 May 2008","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie was so bad I was compelled to go online and write about it.reasons why this is one of the worst movies ever1.

Initially high on the film's mix of swordfighting, skin, and magic, I eventually became a fan of Robert Howard's fantasy writing and the film seemed to suffer greatly by comparison. Of course such overly literal comparisons are un-necessary. Red Sonja is only marginally even a Robert Howard character, and more a creation of Marvel Comics' Roy Thomas and others. But she does walk the same dusty streets as Conan and Kull, and her Conan-esquire prince in this one is supposed to be a Hyrkanian Lord named Kalidor (Arnold Schwartzenneger). What should be said is that the character is not identical to Conan, but Arnold's performance as Kalidor is exactly the same as his interpretation of Conan.He seems only too happy to sink into the background as much as possible on this one; his original Conan co-star Sandahl Bergman is comparatively ambitious and scenery-chewing as a witch queen who seizes a glowing orb that controls the weather. As for the star of the show, Brigitte Nielsen, the less said of her acting by far the better. Seeing as most Italian movies are fixed in post-production, I'm astounded that even dubbing could not have solved some of the most woeful problems with her lack of inflection. There's literally no emotion in her voice at any time really. On the positive side, that does make her an equal match for Schwartzenneger. Ernie Reyes Jr., who made his film debut in Berry Gordy's The Last Dragon the previous year, is fun comic diversion as an undisciplined prince, and he shows off his martial arts skills to good effect.The best thing about the film is the great score supplied by Ennio Morricone which lifts everything up a notch. The matte work is also quite well done, and despite what perhaps others have said about the film its production values are generally high just as usual for a DeLaurentis production. The photography is quite beautiful in some places, thanks to Giuseppe Rotunno (who also shot Gilliam's lovely Baron Munchausen), but Richard Fleischer's monotonous direction drags the film down at every opportunity when it could have soared. The script is very hollow too -- basically the plot consists of leaving one member or other of the group behind so that he can suddenly appear in time to *surprise* save the rest from whatever monster they've encountered.Basically what we have here is something that you can enjoy if you have a few drinks in you, the music and the photography will carry you if you're in the mood for a fantasy vibe, but the acting in general and the story are very dull.

BLUE STREAK is not great, perhaps not as good as other entries in the genre, but it's an effective one it it gets it done with fun and wit. Few comedies are this at least funny, some are hardly funny at all.Lawrence plays top thief Miles Logan, who has just stolen a priceless diamond, but quickly pursued by the police.

But getting that rock may just be harder than he thought. Turns out, the building's finished, and it turns out to be a police station. To get to his rock, he has to dress up as a detective and boss around his partner (Wilson) and a couple of thugs, some of which he works with, including an annoying lousy thief (Chapelle).The premise is such a good idea, but, unlike other comedies that hardly make it out of the board meetings, BLUE STREAK effectively delivers.

Between the three films I've seen of his- Funny Games (US), Cache and now The Piano Teacher- he's certainly not a director to make his films boring. This is to his credit as a provocateur more-so than as a genuine art-house\/Euro talent; his work is a kin to giving you a swift kick in the nuts, giving a tid-bit of ice for the wound, and then having you watching in eager anticipation for the next event to come.

For the Piano Teacher, which may be the most disturbing of Europe's crop of psycho-sexual dramas of the decade, deals out its main character as something between a side character in Barry Lyndon and, well, your local cold-fish of a teacher at school, but it's not a cold movie, per-say.Rather, The Piano Teacher never moves its gaze from its characters movements or actions, usually going right with the action without 'flashy' turns, and the only music coming out of those luminous numbers from Schubert and, oddly enough, that one numbner from Barry Lyndon. And at the center of Haneke's torrid drama is Isabele Hupert in the title role, playing a woman who still lives with her mother (one of the most fascinating things for me in the film, something that adds a whole other level of the psychological tension, perverseness), and rarely has a good word to say about anyone's musical ability. Least of all for the young man (played very well by Benoit Magnimel), who has an affinity for Schubert and finds something in this teacher he wants to know more; he pursues the poisition of student very much despite being rejected by her. But then they meet again, in a manner that is so deranged I dare not mention it here (let's just say it's a manner of horrible, unforgivable payback that says all that needs to be said about Hupert's insecurities).Like Last Tango in Paris, the sexual congress is intense, rough, and uncompromising for what many of us consider practical, loving contact. These characters- in Haneke's universe probably more- are driven by obsessive needs and something they can't express, and ironically, when Hupert puts her thoughts and desires all out there in un-poetic writing, it becomes the Achilles heel. There's a lot that Haneke explores here that sparks interest, and I found myself thinking about the ideas and the cold look of Hupert (one that, showing how great she is in the part, you keep looking for the slightest change of the guard) and why it didn't totally knock me off my feet... Maybe it did, in a manner of speaking. By the end of the film, which concludes perhaps logically if somewhat randomly, I was shocked and appalled, but I also knew I had seen something powerful and challenging to boot. How do we contemplate these characters that are seemingly the everyday sort but are dark and depraved and wanting something from someone that they can't get?

However, I feel that Gary Oldman's many contributions to these departures have been sorely overlooked by the IMDb reviewing community. I will address these momentarily.First, a few words about the direction and concept behind this film.It is clear that this movie was driven by two primal forces (1) Gary Oldman's egomaniacal desire to be portrayed as a Victorian sex object, and (2) the makeup department. That this movie was driven by these forces amounts to a coup de tate, with director Coppolla, the famed director of jACK, left by the wayside. I am willing to forgive Francis for this film, if only because every director is bound to create a Dracula at some point in their career. After all, David Fincher has his Alien 3 and his Panic Room, while Michael Bay has his entire resume.Conceptually, this film is lacking. It is not clear to me why Dracula merits a modern retelling, particularly when the Count himself comes off looking not like a horrific soldier of Satan, but a retired employee at the Waffle Crisp cereal factory...on a bad day. More importantly, the love theme, as well as the film's constant forays into bestiality, is curious and distracting, at best-- disgusting at its worst. When Lucy is being eaten out by Gary Oldman in wolf form and he flashes a toothy smile for the camera, I almost stopped watching.In light of these concept flaws, the casting was absolutely dreadful. Where do I even begin? Keanue Reeves plays Jonathan Harker with all the subtlety and emotion of Agent Smith-- a computer generated enemy. His accent is only outstaged by the Academy Award-winning makeup team that generated Gary Oldman's asshat (aka. his cafeteria worker- inspired hairnet). Winona Ryder constantly seems as if she has just been caught shoplifting, as she steals glances at the John Lennon-inspired Dracula. Meanwhile, a hopeless Anthony Hopkins plays Van Helsing with all the enthusiasm of Hannibal Lecter's dinner guests-- I sensed throughout the film, as if he knew exactly what he was involved in-- a carnival devoted to the makeup demands of a sexually frustrated Gary Oldman.Many have the audacity to applaud this film's costume and production design. I have the sense to criticize it entirely.The sets bring to mind the cheap cardboard outlines of 1960's Star Trek Episodes without the visual flair. The obvious use of blue screens during outdoor scenes left me begging for the cinematography of Daniel Stern's Bushwhacked. Not only poorly executed, but the attempt to use shadow puppets to present Dracula's ulterior motives, was conceptually ignoble. The chase scene to Dracula's castle attempted to mold Transylvanian customs and American West stagecoach drama-- it did not succeed. Victorian London is portrayed with all the creativity of a Compton street opera. The excessive use of fog is clichéd and distracting, the dark garden scenes do nothing to put the lesbian relationships into proper context, and Renfield's prison lacked a chamber pot. Costumes-- John Lennon sunglasses, velvet suits, Leopard Skin Pillbox Hats, Fu-Manchus, and red imperial dresses have no place in Victorian England, or our time. Coppolla's deferment to his costume department is unforgivable, but in line with the rest of this production. To those who believe that this film's sets, costumes, etc. were its strength-- I agree, if only because Gary Oldman is almost certainly its most glaring weakness.The title character of Count Dracula is presented as a sort of desperate lover, a man whose murderous swath through 800 years as a demon is solely the result of lost love. I beg to differ. Dracula is a vampire (vampyr as Van Helsing's book points out) whom we should hate and despise. That the female lead ends up falling in love with him is a testament to the fundamentally sick mind of Gary Oldman. I refuse to believe that Francis Ford Coppolla was responsible for the excesses of Count Dracula presented in this movie. Rather, he was held hostage by Gary Oldman and his lesbian female supporting actresses. Even Keanu Reeves cannot be held solely responsible for what happens to this film the moment Gary Oldman graces the screen.The artistic choices related to Gary Oldman's portrayal of Dracula are crippling to the film's overall message and an embarrassment to film. Dracula likes to have sex? OK. Dracula likes to have sex with three female demon slaves? Alright. Dracula likes to have sex as a wolf? You're starting to lose me. Dracula likes to have sex with women and then cause their heads to explode in blood (a la Lucy)? What the hell is going on here? Dracula likes to have sex dressed as John Lennon? You've crossed the line.I'm not sure when I first decided that I hated Gary Oldman in this movie. It may have been during the crude Romeo and Juliet imitation scene in the chapel that allegedly took place during the 1300s. It may have also been the time his shadow obviously popped a boner while making threatening gestures at Keanue Reeves. Most likely, it was when he was seen crawling up and down the castle wall in a powdered wig.I hate everything this about this movie, but most of all, I hate this movie for what it could have been. Throw Tim Burton into the director's chair, Jon Voight, into Gary Oldman's prep room, and Dame Judi Dench into the shoes of Winona Ryder, and you have the makings of a modern classic.I give this two stars for its comedic value.

","genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Romance"},{"date":"12 May 2008","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Having spent the best part of the nineties making dark, dank, visual nightmares, French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet began the new millennium with a film so seemingly light-hearted and sweat natured that it managed to captivate many viewers who would not normally appreciate a French-language film. Others however have found it somewhat alienating, with a small fraction seeming highly critical of the unashamed romanticism and moments of fantastical abstraction. However, to view Amelie (2001) as a simple frothy farce - a modern day fairy-story with a contemporary edge - is missing the point somewhat; neglecting the darker moments of the narrative and the prevailing feeling of alienation and melancholy that punctuates many of the more rose-tinted scenes.If we question the use of style here, it becomes apparent that there are two singular interpretations that you can take in enjoying this film. The first is the most simple and immediate; the idea of an abstract fantasy, that envelopes the characters and presents the power of true love and imagination in all its colourful glory. The second interpretation is somewhat more difficult; the idea that the more imaginative elements are symptomatic of the loneliness and intense sadness felt by the central character as she attempts to navigate herself through life. By extension, the way we approach the film depends very much on the way we approach the central character, whose attempts at goodwill and the process of shaping the course of life to suit her own thoughts and feelings will either seem charming and playful, or obsessive and unhinged. When I first saw the film I took it at face value; I suppose, largely as a result of how different it was to the films that Jeunet had previously made with Marc Caro. However, after half a decade of watching and re-watching, it becomes incredibly clear that Amelie is a darker film than many would care to admit; one that features suicide, illness, the death of Princess Diana, loneliness, ennui, obsession and a brief depiction of the sex industry, distorted and abstracted by an incredibly child-like perspective.You don't have to see it on such a level - with the immediate interpretation being just as much fun - but you can't help but think that the scene in which Amelie sits on the roof of her building and fantasises about the sexual-climaxes of almost every single couple in Paris is somewhat uncomfortable, especially since the character is supposedly twenty-two, and not fifteen! Likewise, the central character sees her own mother commit suicide, another character is bullied as a child, and then, of course, we have that other central character whose disability has made it impossible for him to leave the house for the vast majority of his adult life. For me, the film was more of a tear-jerker than something that made me leave the theatre with a warm smile on my face; with the melancholic music of Yann Tiersen - with its accordions, horns, strings and toy-pianos - perfectly capturing the essence of this character trapped between childhood and adult life, and left alienated as a result.Even though everything in the film works out, to some extent, with the character ultimately achieving her goal, that final chord of the music and that odd glance to the camera seems pregnant with all kind of ideas of sadness and disappointment. Not disappointment in the situation, but disappointment in the inevitable realisation that life is never at a single constant; it has ups and downs with one fleeting moment of perfect joy often followed by the same kind of sadness and hurt that is all too familiar. As I said, this interpretation is merely personal. It doesn't take away from the experience that Amelie presents and the fantastic world that Jeunet is able to create. However, for me, this world works best as a piece of subjective abstraction. Obviously, those of us that have spent time in France know that their major cities look nothing like the one depicted here, and are in fact, closer to something like Pola X (1999) or In Praise of Love (2001). With this in mind, Amelie reminded me of Jean Luc Godard's first masterpiece Une femme est une femme (1961), with the colourful use of mise-en-scene, costumes and production design - not to mention the subtle juxtaposition of iconography and genre references - all creating a mood and a tone that works towards disguising the more sad and tragic elements of both the character and the film.Regardless of how you choose to interpret the character, the central performance from Audrey Tautou is exceptionally rendered and very much advantageous to the success of the film and the mood that it instils us with. Her movements, rhythms and expressions are as bold and as colourful as the direction of Jeunet, and yet, even here we see a sense of tragedy, cynicism and disappointment that mirrors that of the actual story. Nonetheless, the film is a definite must see work, if not for the bold and intelligent direction of Jeunet then for the fine performances from the likes of Dominique Pinon, Jamel Debbouze, Isabelle Nanty, Serge Merlin, Mathieu Kassovitz, Rufus, the gnome, etc. Whichever interpretation you choose to follow with Amelie, there is no denying that the film is continually interesting, quirky and imaginative, and proves beyond all else that there is still intelligence and individuality present in contemporary film.

Others however have found it somewhat alienating, with a small fraction seeming highly critical of the unashamed romanticism and moments of fantastical abstraction. However, to view Amelie (2001) as a simple frothy farce - a modern day fairy-story with a contemporary edge - is missing the point somewhat; neglecting the darker moments of the narrative and the prevailing feeling of alienation and melancholy that punctuates many of the more rose-tinted scenes.If we question the use of style here, it becomes apparent that there are two singular interpretations that you can take in enjoying this film. The first is the most simple and immediate; the idea of an abstract fantasy, that envelopes the characters and presents the power of true love and imagination in all its colourful glory. The second interpretation is somewhat more difficult; the idea that the more imaginative elements are symptomatic of the loneliness and intense sadness felt by the central character as she attempts to navigate herself through life. By extension, the way we approach the film depends very much on the way we approach the central character, whose attempts at goodwill and the process of shaping the course of life to suit her own thoughts and feelings will either seem charming and playful, or obsessive and unhinged. When I first saw the film I took it at face value; I suppose, largely as a result of how different it was to the films that Jeunet had previously made with Marc Caro. However, after half a decade of watching and re-watching, it becomes incredibly clear that Amelie is a darker film than many would care to admit; one that features suicide, illness, the death of Princess Diana, loneliness, ennui, obsession and a brief depiction of the sex industry, distorted and abstracted by an incredibly child-like perspective.You don't have to see it on such a level - with the immediate interpretation being just as much fun - but you can't help but think that the scene in which Amelie sits on the roof of her building and fantasises about the sexual-climaxes of almost every single couple in Paris is somewhat uncomfortable, especially since the character is supposedly twenty-two, and not fifteen! Likewise, the central character sees her own mother commit suicide, another character is bullied as a child, and then, of course, we have that other central character whose disability has made it impossible for him to leave the house for the vast majority of his adult life. For me, the film was more of a tear-jerker than something that made me leave the theatre with a warm smile on my face; with the melancholic music of Yann Tiersen - with its accordions, horns, strings and toy-pianos - perfectly capturing the essence of this character trapped between childhood and adult life, and left alienated as a result.Even though everything in the film works out, to some extent, with the character ultimately achieving her goal, that final chord of the music and that odd glance to the camera seems pregnant with all kind of ideas of sadness and disappointment. Not disappointment in the situation, but disappointment in the inevitable realisation that life is never at a single constant; it has ups and downs with one fleeting moment of perfect joy often followed by the same kind of sadness and hurt that is all too familiar. As I said, this interpretation is merely personal. It doesn't take away from the experience that Amelie presents and the fantastic world that Jeunet is able to create. However, for me, this world works best as a piece of subjective abstraction. Obviously, those of us that have spent time in France know that their major cities look nothing like the one depicted here, and are in fact, closer to something like Pola X (1999) or In Praise of Love (2001). With this in mind, Amelie reminded me of Jean Luc Godard's first masterpiece Une femme est une femme (1961), with the colourful use of mise-en-scene, costumes and production design - not to mention the subtle juxtaposition of iconography and genre references - all creating a mood and a tone that works towards disguising the more sad and tragic elements of both the character and the film.Regardless of how you choose to interpret the character, the central performance from Audrey Tautou is exceptionally rendered and very much advantageous to the success of the film and the mood that it instils us with. Her movements, rhythms and expressions are as bold and as colourful as the direction of Jeunet, and yet, even here we see a sense of tragedy, cynicism and disappointment that mirrors that of the actual story. Nonetheless, the film is a definite must see work, if not for the bold and intelligent direction of Jeunet then for the fine performances from the likes of Dominique Pinon, Jamel Debbouze, Isabelle Nanty, Serge Merlin, Mathieu Kassovitz, Rufus, the gnome, etc. Whichever interpretation you choose to follow with Amelie, there is no denying that the film is continually interesting, quirky and imaginative, and proves beyond all else that there is still intelligence and individuality present in contemporary film.

When he ejects his partner Capt.

This is no exception to that rule; from the very beginning to the very end, starting with the very first shot and object that we are shown(meanwhile, that entire scene fits so well into the rest, that its background, written in the Trivia section(for you to either read or avoid to do so) is unexpected). The plot is great, and well-told. This is interesting and engaging throughout. The acting isn't bad for any of the performers(well, maybe the kid, but... it's a kid). This is genuinely scary. The effects are well-done, not sure there really are any herein that fail to live up to that. I knew I had to view this when I heard that Rob Bottin(who went on to help make The Thing(one of my favorites, along with Halloween) the amazing piece that it is) had two separate jobs in this. I was not disappointed. Carpenter yet again gets a lot out of not that much money. There are films with considerably larger budgets that won't offer anything resembling the mood that seeps through the screen from every frame of this, or the shocks. He also makes this work remarkably well... I normally don't go for this type of horror. The story is rather good. I recommend this to fans of this kind of movie and\/or John Carpenter and what we're used to him delivering. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 May 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" First off, I watched this on television, so it is possible that it was, at least somewhat, censored.
