One year later, I still enjoyed but was a bit perplexed was this the usual Liberal Hollywood taking shots at right-wingers or is this actually the reverse with the left-wingers, the Communists really being shown as the bad guys? After a third and final viewing a few years later, I felt it was both but the leaned toward Liberal, which is par for the course. The general plot had left wingers brainwashing an influential American family into looking like extreme right wingers and gaining access to the White House through political influence and assassination. Most of the movie featured a Joe McCarthy-ish senator (James Gregory) and his conniving wife (Angela Lansbury) as the villains. They were portrayed as right wingers, of course, but were really just dupes of the Communists (left wing)! Got that??!Suffice to say the movie had messages from both the Right and Left but politics aside, the film boasts an involving story that keeps your interest for most of the two hours and six minutes, and had some very interesting characters who are fascinating to watch. That includes the supporting roles. It didn't hurt to have John Frankenheimer direct, either. His films usually were outstanding.I thought Lansbury and Laurence Harvey had the best parts of the film. The only really stupid and\/or annoying character in the movie was played by Janet Leigh. Her romance scenes with Frank Sinatra added nothing to this riveting film. Eliminated, it would have made for a tighter, even better movie. Also, Sinatra found out too easily where Harvey was hiding in Madison Square Garden. Nobody could figure it out that fast! Nonetheless, the ending was a bit surprising and I won't spoil it for anyone who has not seen this.The movie has endured the test of time and, from what I hear, would have been best left on its own instead of watering down the name of this film with an insipid re-make. This is The Manchurian Candidate version you want to see.

Where would I land, which heavy object would I have to dodge to keep from being squashed, etc. Such is the power of movies; they have the ability to alter perspective, not in some deeply profound way; but with the subtle way you perceive the world.My upside down view of the world is an outgrowth from having seen THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE dozens of times over the years and gotten a kick out of the moment on New Year's Eve when the entire boat capsizes and everyone goes head over heels. The movie took something readily recognizable and made it fascinating just by flipping it over.THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE was the first and the best of the so-called disaster movies of the 1970s. Okay, the original AIRPORT and long before that 1939s SAN FRANCISCO were first, but the airborne disaster in one and the earthquake in the other were mere threads in rambling soap operas; POSEIDON was the first where the catastrophe was the focal point and the starting point. As such, producer Irwin Allen was mining new territory and essentially created the genre -- though its value as a cinematic art is certainly debatable.Anyway, I think that the original POSEIDON works, where so many of those that followed didn't, because it has a sense of humor. Certainly, while many imitators (EARTHQUAKE, THE TOWERING INFERNO, POSEIDON's two woeful remakes, etc.) were laughable, they weren't humorous in a humane sort of way. The film recognizes that its basic premise is absurd, but doesn't dwell on it, placing the emphasis on the people not the situation.The disaster movie became quickly known as a vehicle where stick-figure characters, burdened with cumbersome and melodramatic backstories and played by big-name stars shamelessly emoting all over the place, bided their time as the impending doom of the special effects polished them off one by one. As such, the disaster became the star, not unlike Freddie Krueger or Michael Meyers or other horror movie boogie men; and the point of the film was less about survival than about not surviving, about how and when the special effects and the stunt team would give which character the next big adios.You'd be hard pressed to remember, let alone care, who played what character in EARTHQUAKE or THE SWARM or AIRPORT 19-whatever. That's the beauty of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE; even if you think the characters are caricatures, their backstories lame and the whole film silly, they nonetheless stick with you. Part of this is due, I think, to the fact that the characters are more real; there are no multimillionaire industrialists, no fading movie stars, no international terrorists or jewel thieves, no phoney-baloney VIPs of any sort. The final voyage of the SS Poseidon carries a rather mundane passenger list of tourists, honeymooners, doting grandparents and lonely singles. They're ordinary people who end up in extraordinary circumstances. Likewise, the cast is made up of ordinary movie stars; none of the cast (with the notable exception of star Gene Hackman, hot off his success in THE FRENCH CONNECTION) were at the height of their careers, but they are an immensely likable ensemble of recognizable character actors; Red Button, Roddy MacDowall, Stella Stevens, Shelley Winters, Ernest Borgnine, Jack Albertson, Arthur O'Connell, etc. They are performers who the audience is so comfortable with that you instantly are concerned for their safety. Bigger stars might have overwhelmed the story, like in THE TOWERING INFERNO or EARTHQUAKE; but here, if you don't like Shelley, you just might identify with her character. Bottom line you really do care who survives and you are hurt when so-and-so meets his unexpected and untimely end.Even Hackman manages to be larger than life and yet rather ordinary as the movie hero. Though he plays a minister -- in itself an odd choice for an action hero -- his Rev. Scott is something of a rebel, an outspoken, liberal cleric, like those who popped up during the antiwar movement of the 60s. Instead of the icy, grim hero of most of these films, as the story's Christ's figure, Hackman's Scott is guided as much by his emotions as by his self-righteousness. He's certainly no Charlton Heston -- and that is just fine. Through Scott, the film delivers a fiery sermon that puts a strange spin on the usual Darwinism that rules this type of film. While the film pays due respect to the old it's God's will style of religion as embodied in Arthur O'Connell's Chaplain John, the main message of POSEIDON is that of self confidence and self-determination. Darwin's survival of the fittest ideology is not seen as a contradiction to the theology of the meek shall inherit; -- perhaps suggesting that the meek must survive in order to inherit.Though not handled with very much grace, the film's religious themes nonetheless give THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE a bit of backbone; arguing that religion without action is futile and that one of God's greatest gifts is the will to survive.As an action machine, POSEIDON hasn't aged all that well; it's special effects and production values now seem sort of quaint. Yet, at the same time, these things give it a bit of character, a remembrance of when drama was defined by a good cast, an intriguing story and a sense of adventure, not just by how cleverly a CGI technician can manipulate images. Like the ship itself, THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE may be a fine lady that's seen better days, but unlike the ship in question, it seems to sail on and on, seemingly unsinkable.

Yes, the story sounds unoriginal When a married woman meets a man in a railway station and they both fall in love. But the process of it is what really stood out. The main character Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) is the dreadful looking, despondent wife who falls in love with Dr. Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard) in a railway station. They first meet when she gets something in her eye and calls someone over because her eye is in deep pain. When they first meet, they don't seem to get involved that much but they sure do spot each other and go on their ways. Laura seems somewhat paranoid and crazy at times; talking to herself on the train and that starting to laugh for no reason too thinking badly about a woman who talks too much around her. She then goes home and notices she's been gone for a while now. She didn't want her husband to think suspiciously of her because she's been cheating on him. Then she starts to imagine back at the good times she and Alec had had together. This somewhat also reminds me of Vertigo because that's another story about a man and a woman that fall in love with each other and the woman is MARRIED! Or is she? The film is a bit more mysterious and suspenseful than I was envisioning it. I was envisioning just a dramatic love story but putting mystery and suspense in there makes the film even more enjoyable. May I add it was very well-acted too? This film also was fun to watch because of the quirky camera and the good music. This obviously wasn't as violent and involved as Wolfgang Petersen's surprising mystery thriller Shattered which was another dramatic love story which was actually pretty good. It had a pretty similar story to this film when it comes to the drama and the mystery even though this one is definitely tamer and didn't involve a murder of someone.

Yes, the story sounds unoriginal When a married woman meets a man in a railway station and they both fall in love. But the process of it is what really stood out. The main character Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) is the dreadful looking, despondent wife who falls in love with Dr. Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard) in a railway station. They first meet when she gets something in her eye and calls someone over because her eye is in deep pain. When they first meet, they don't seem to get involved that much but they sure do spot each other and go on their ways. Laura seems somewhat paranoid and crazy at times; talking to herself on the train and that starting to laugh for no reason too thinking badly about a woman who talks too much around her. She then goes home and notices she's been gone for a while now. She didn't want her husband to think suspiciously of her because she's been cheating on him. Then she starts to imagine back at the good times she and Alec had had together. This somewhat also reminds me of Vertigo because that's another story about a man and a woman that fall in love with each other and the woman is MARRIED! Or is she? The film is a bit more mysterious and suspenseful than I was envisioning it. I was envisioning just a dramatic love story but putting mystery and suspense in there makes the film even more enjoyable. May I add it was very well-acted too? This film also was fun to watch because of the quirky camera and the good music. This obviously wasn't as violent and involved as Wolfgang Petersen's surprising mystery thriller Shattered which was another dramatic love story which was actually pretty good.

The chief problem I heard was that it was long. Well, it is long, running exactly three hours to the end of the credits. But I find that the length allowed me to achieve some 'distance' from the events that began the story, so that when the ending arrived, it wasn't so fresh - in other words we as viewers have been taken on a journey.And what a journey! We are treated to a warm and insightful examination of what it means to love. The love of a father for his daughters, and between the characters of Susan (the always-stunning Claire Forlani) and Joe (the equally gorgeous Brad Pitt), are the main focus of the story, but we are also treated to a very special moment as Jeffrey Tambor's character (a corporate loser with an ill-fitting suit and unfortunate facial hair) shares the joy of his relationship with his neurotic wife (the wonderful Marcia Gay Harden). There are also hints of fraternal, platonic love among Joe, his ersatz guide (Anthony Hopkins), and his son-in-law, Tambor.This is not an immature or simple love, either. The film deals tenderly with questions of responsibility and power, self-giving and fidelity. I am a huge fan of stories in which a person simply and confidently is who they are and forces others to react, think, and make decisions. There are several moments in this movie when Joe follows Lewis Carroll's great advice, When in doubt, don't just do something. Stand there. There is an entire conversation with Susan in which he says nothing, but it is not one-sided, because she is forced to think about what she's saying. (Another example of a film where someone forces others to react and grow, simply by being himself, is Life As A House.)One of the problems with the initial release of this film may have been the theatrical trailer, which portrays a fun, humorous, and 'jaunty' Rom-Com with a slight metaphysical twist. People who went expecting to see that kind of movie would certainly be disappointed. The metaphysical content is more than slight (Joe is the personification of Death), and the movie never becomes fun or jaunty. What it is, is touching, intelligent, and utterly romantic in the best sense of the word.On the negative side, it is difficult to identify with the lifestyle of the characters (Hopkins is an unimaginably wealthy media mogul) and I found the sheer opulence and excessiveness of their surroundings to be distracting at times. However, it does make for great eye-candy on the screen, and the actors are more than able to bring their characters to life; none of them are dilettante, and Hopkins brings an elegance and self-awareness to the rich man stereotype.And speaking of stereotypes, the only antagonist in the film (Jake Weber as Hopkins' corporate right-hand and Susan's would-be love-interest) ends up a two-dimensional and utterly unsympathetic character who is incapable of the kind of love displayed by the people around him. It's a disappointing caricature in a movie filled with deeply explored archetypal characters. The filmmakers had an opportunity to demonstrate that all people have subtle, nuanced personalities, but there is none of that with Weber's role. On the other hand, Weber does a fine job with what he was given, and it is an interesting example of how an immature or self-interested person will attempt to sabotage the well-being of others rather than allow them to change and grow.This is an unusual movie that has not developed a cult following, which means it is probably destined to be overlooked by both the mainstream and the fringe movie fan, which is unfortunate. If it had been better marketed (the trailer is a criminal misrepresentation of the movie) it might have a higher profile today. At any rate, if you are a fan of careful, thoughtful, and emotionally mature storytelling, I fully recommend this movie to your perusal.

Many wrote that she was not cast in many movies - our loss !! Because the entire film was based-on close-ups, this is a testament to her beauty and skill in acting.I was taken aback again on how scrawny John Hodiak looked in the movie, as he was one of the big box-office hotties in that period. His acting was superb, but the body needed a lot of work for the bully he played.We all know by now that he took-over as captain of the lifeboat, but was bested by the rescued, German U-Boat captain - sneakily condescending for his own safety - by Walter Slezak - skillful ! As the movie was purposefully intended to show the reaction of dissimilar characters in a desperate situation, few people commented on the wonderfully-under-played role by a young-and-handsome sailor, Hume Cronyn. William Bendix was William Bendix, although he got higher billing than both Hodiak and Cronyn. Remarkably, no one commented on Canada Lee's question I get to vote, too?, in those days a loaded line by a Black actor. I was engrossed in how these dissimilar people reacted to one another. I really didn't see this film as a huge, political statement. I only saw raw emotions - well depicted.AGAIN - I wish to explain that I do not watch movies because of certain actors-actresses - although Bankhead was one of my favorites - I love the movie, as a whole. I was lucky to see it when it was first released and have NEVER lost interest in it. Lifeboat is a true-to-life, suspenseful thriller that never drags nor gets boring - it's got my 10-to-10....

The interviews on the DVD on the matter is pretty interesting and very informative. It was nice to see it in its full cut, as think I caught the original theatrical release when it was played on TV.This fascinating film is something you won't see quite often with it's very expressive and soothing folk musical elements that burns itself a mark in the haunting atmosphere.

The film is probably best known for it's shocking conclusion and I still get goose bumps and a lump in my throat when watching it.The credible story by Anthony Shaffer stirs the emotions by balancing out some complex and poetic details, but it's so well rounded on many levels that the intensity thickens with the continuous debate between the two religions - Christianity and Paganism.

The film's art direction is beautifully captured with it's mesmerizing glow and the picturesque location provided some breath-taking scenery.The performances are nothing but short of fabulous with a strong show by the entire cast.

I can't think of another action film replicated or alluded to more. Films like Under Siege, Speed, Passenger 57 all have the same basic premise. Cop or special forces guy find themselves cornered by terrorists or criminals, and gradually outmanoeuvre them. And Cliffhanger definitely falls into that category.When I first saw Cliffhanger, I loved it. I thought it made use of great stunts, dizzy-inducing mountain climbs and exciting action sequences. But as the years passed, and I've grown a bit wiser, Cliffhanger doesn't quite do for me what it used to.It's a film that requires you to suspend disbelief a little too much. Not surprising considering it's directed by Renny Harlin. He tends to specialise in action films barely held together by explosive action scenes with little regard for characterisation or plot development.Harlin previously directed Die Hard 2, a film with many of the same problems as Cliffhanger. Die Hard has layers of sophistication and style that Harlin is unable to bring forth in his films. I'm sorry but he's no John McTiernan. Still, despite its flaws Cliffhanger does hold your attention fairly well, the location shooting is often breathtaking, and some of the action scenes are really spectacular.Cliffhanger was billed as Sylvester Stallone's comeback film after his disastrous attempts at comedy. In fact, the only time I ever liked him in a comical role was Demolition Man. That film worked because it was a very funny satirical vision of the future, and Stallone was helped no end by the ebullient comic timing of Sandra Bullock. Cliffhanger certainly has its shortcomings, but its better than the dreadful Stop, Or My Mom Will Shoot!Gabe Walker (Stallone) is the leader of the Rocky Mountain Rescue Team. When his best friend Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) is stuck on a mountain ledge with his girlfriend Sarah, Gabe leads a rescue party. Gabe rigs a support line to a rescue helicopter, but Sarah's safety harness comes loose. In one of the best scenes, Gabe has to struggle to hold on to Sarah. Filled with quick pans and close-ups, that is a very nail-biting scene. Tragically, Sarah slips from his grasp and plunges to her death.Eight months later, Gabe has returned to the mountains after a self-imposed exile. Gabe has lost his nerve, and doesn't want to be responsible for any more lives. But a chance for redemption presents itself when a Treasury Jet with a hundred million dollars on board is hijacked by a group of terrorists led by the psychotic (and sarcastic) Eric Qualen (John Lithgow in British Alan Rickman mode).The plot goes awry when the money falls into the mountains and Qualen's plane crashes. With no way to get down, Qualen sends out a fake distress call picked up by Hal. When he goes alone Jessie, Gabe's ex convinces Gabe to help. Although Hal is in no mood since he blames Gabe for Sarah's death.The two are captured by Qualen's men, and forced to lead a search through the mountains for the missing money. But Gabe manages to escape, and teamed up with Jessie, plays a game of cat and mouse with Qualen's gang to get to the money first.If reading any of this has left you scratching your heads in disbelief, its not hard to see why. Cliffhanger has so many inconsistencies and glaring plot holes you may find yourself cracking up at the absurdity of it all. Still, Stallone is in his element and he's up to the strenuous stuff. But you wonder why they bothered with the beginning, plunging Gabe into a crisis of confidence. Once the action has started, that idea is dropped and it never resurfaces.Cliffhanger is also an action film that's a little rough around the edges. Some of the editing is clumsy and not as tight as it should have been. For example, Gabe has driven off making it clear he wants nothing to do with any rescue attempts. The next time we see him he's on the mountain ahead of Hal. We get the impression there may have been a scene in between showing him changing his mind, but that's been left on the cutting room floor. Harlin may have been going for slick, but honestly it comes off as a hatchet job.John Lithgow is completely over the top, but at least he gets a lot of memorable one liners. Lithgow is an odd choice for an action film villain, and its clear he's trying to channel a bit of Hans Gruber into his performance, but he can't quite pull it off. A pity really considering John Lithgow is a fine actor most of the time.Janine Turner gets a thankless role as the love interest. Her performance as Jessie is really bad, and her character is so poorly written because of the way she alternates from feisty to useless screamer. When you think of Sandra Bullock in some of her action films, you will see how this character could have been played.There are some memorable action scenes to be had though. As well as the opening one, there's a great moment where an actual stuntman makes his way across a cable from one plane to the next in midair. That's a fine bit of stunt-work, and gives new meaning to death-defying. I also like the scene when Gabe falls through the ice being pursued by one of Qualen's men, his fight with Qualen on a helicopter, and the lovely closing shot of the mountains.Cliffhanger is by no means motion picture poetry. But it's not a bad way to spend an hour and a half, and you do cheer along when some of the villains get their comeuppance. You just wish it were a bit more coherent.But then, they can't all be Die Hard, can they?

Still, despite its flaws Cliffhanger does hold your attention fairly well, the location shooting is often breathtaking, and some of the action scenes are really spectacular.Cliffhanger was billed as Sylvester Stallone's comeback film after his disastrous attempts at comedy. In fact, the only time I ever liked him in a comical role was Demolition Man. That film worked because it was a very funny satirical vision of the future, and Stallone was helped no end by the ebullient comic timing of Sandra Bullock. Cliffhanger certainly has its shortcomings, but its better than the dreadful Stop, Or My Mom Will Shoot!Gabe Walker (Stallone) is the leader of the Rocky Mountain Rescue Team. When his best friend Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) is stuck on a mountain ledge with his girlfriend Sarah, Gabe leads a rescue party. Gabe rigs a support line to a rescue helicopter, but Sarah's safety harness comes loose. In one of the best scenes, Gabe has to struggle to hold on to Sarah. Filled with quick pans and close-ups, that is a very nail-biting scene. Tragically, Sarah slips from his grasp and plunges to her death.Eight months later, Gabe has returned to the mountains after a self-imposed exile. Gabe has lost his nerve, and doesn't want to be responsible for any more lives. But a chance for redemption presents itself when a Treasury Jet with a hundred million dollars on board is hijacked by a group of terrorists led by the psychotic (and sarcastic) Eric Qualen (John Lithgow in British Alan Rickman mode).The plot goes awry when the money falls into the mountains and Qualen's plane crashes. With no way to get down, Qualen sends out a fake distress call picked up by Hal. When he goes alone Jessie, Gabe's ex convinces Gabe to help. Although Hal is in no mood since he blames Gabe for Sarah's death.The two are captured by Qualen's men, and forced to lead a search through the mountains for the missing money. But Gabe manages to escape, and teamed up with Jessie, plays a game of cat and mouse with Qualen's gang to get to the money first.If reading any of this has left you scratching your heads in disbelief, its not hard to see why. Cliffhanger has so many inconsistencies and glaring plot holes you may find yourself cracking up at the absurdity of it all. Still, Stallone is in his element and he's up to the strenuous stuff. But you wonder why they bothered with the beginning, plunging Gabe into a crisis of confidence. Once the action has started, that idea is dropped and it never resurfaces.Cliffhanger is also an action film that's a little rough around the edges. Some of the editing is clumsy and not as tight as it should have been. For example, Gabe has driven off making it clear he wants nothing to do with any rescue attempts. The next time we see him he's on the mountain ahead of Hal. We get the impression there may have been a scene in between showing him changing his mind, but that's been left on the cutting room floor. Harlin may have been going for slick, but honestly it comes off as a hatchet job.John Lithgow is completely over the top, but at least he gets a lot of memorable one liners. Lithgow is an odd choice for an action film villain, and its clear he's trying to channel a bit of Hans Gruber into his performance, but he can't quite pull it off. A pity really considering John Lithgow is a fine actor most of the time.Janine Turner gets a thankless role as the love interest. Her performance as Jessie is really bad, and her character is so poorly written because of the way she alternates from feisty to useless screamer. When you think of Sandra Bullock in some of her action films, you will see how this character could have been played.There are some memorable action scenes to be had though. As well as the opening one, there's a great moment where an actual stuntman makes his way across a cable from one plane to the next in midair. That's a fine bit of stunt-work, and gives new meaning to death-defying. I also like the scene when Gabe falls through the ice being pursued by one of Qualen's men, his fight with Qualen on a helicopter, and the lovely closing shot of the mountains.Cliffhanger is by no means motion picture poetry. But it's not a bad way to spend an hour and a half, and you do cheer along when some of the villains get their comeuppance.

I can't think of another action film replicated or alluded to more. Films like Under Siege, Speed, Passenger 57 all have the same basic premise. Cop or special forces guy find themselves cornered by terrorists or criminals, and gradually outmanoeuvre them. And Cliffhanger definitely falls into that category.When I first saw Cliffhanger, I loved it. I thought it made use of great stunts, dizzy-inducing mountain climbs and exciting action sequences. But as the years passed, and I've grown a bit wiser, Cliffhanger doesn't quite do for me what it used to.It's a film that requires you to suspend disbelief a little too much.

Director George Miller is best known for The Road Warrior and Mad Max, two of the most manic, insanely brutal films ever created. Putting this guy in charge of a children's movie is like letting a bull loose in a china shop. Children's films, more than anything, require a light touch. Perhaps more than any other filmmaker watching Miller's movies is like watching the neighborhood bully on a wild sugar rush. Exhilarating and slightly scary. A lot of times this works (The Witches of Eastwick, The Road Warrior), but here it seems misplaced. Miller is a visionary director with many strengths, but a light touch he does not possess.Babe 2 begins roughly where the first one left off. Babe comes back to the farm a hero, but when farmer Hoggett is laid up after a tragic accident Babe and the farmer's wife must journey by plane to make a celebrity appearance at a livestock show, so they can save the farm, which is in danger of being taken away by the bank. After missing their connecting flight Babe and the farmer's wife are stranded in a strange fictional metropolis that looks like someone took New York, Venice, Rio, Los Angeles, and Paris and squashed them all into a single city. They are then separated and have various cliff-hanger adventures.All of this is eye-popping in the extreme. Miller is definitely a director who thinks outside the box. Twenty minutes into the movie you realize you're watching something totally unlike any other children's movie. Everything is visualized astonishingly and in totally unorthodox fashion. The animals are amazing, particularly a rowdy family of monkeys. They really have personalities. Miller's camera (as in The Road Warrior) goes everywhere - up and down walls, underwater, under doors. It begins to feel like the camera is actually a character in the film. The one definite problem (and I love Miller's movies so I say this with great reservation) is that Babe 2 is just too too dark for kids. In fact, by the time I got to the scene where a wild charity show featuring monkeys and magic explodes into psychedelic chaos it became clear that this isn't really even a children's movie!! It's more some strange experimental film that happens to have talking animals in it.This IS a great movie.

The book wasn't that great, and the movie takes the little bit of good that was in the book out of it. Kevin Costner delivers a low grade performance, except for the final scene which was the only part of the movie that I thought was done well. James Earl Jones delivers a good performance, however an actor can only be as good as the writing, which sucked. Burt Lancaster and Ray Liotta also deliver decent performances, but again, the writing in this movie is absolutely terrible. I hate Amy Madigan so I won't factor her into my rating. This movie is also full of plot holes. The parts that were taken out for the movie for time were not written around. Ordinarily, when adapting a book to film you must omit sections of the book. When you do this, you modify the story in a way that makes sense. This movie does not do that. I mean, why would two parents who's daughter is 5 years old at most be at a high school PTA meeting? I recommend you do not watch this, and when you hear someone say Hey, you know what's a good movie you might enjoy? Field of Dreams that you punch them in the face and say that they offend you. Good day. ","genre":null},{"date":"19 May 2006","score":"9 out of 25 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie is terrible. The book wasn't that great, and the movie takes the little bit of good that was in the book out of it.

And I must say that this movie still rocks the house in special effects, action, story and music! Richard Donner and his crew did a great job bringing Superman to the big screen. The story is simple, the action is great, the special effects are mind blowing and the music is powerful!!! The late Christopher Reeve played the best Superman and really brought the character to life. Gene Hackman is pure evil as Lex Luthor and Margot Kidder played best Lois Lane you have ever seen. I still think that this is the best super hero movie ever made. (Spiderman and Batman were still good).The DVD of the film is A+, the picture has been cleaned up really well, its nice and sharp with no grain. The remastered sound which is presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital is loud, clean and very sharp. They also added new sound effects in the movie, its ashame that they didn't release it in DTS sound! This is still the best Superman movie to date. See this movie if you haven't yet. You will be surprised. 10 of out 10!
