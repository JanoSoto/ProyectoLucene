I vote for the latter.  Desperado stars Antonio Banderas in the title role as a mythical gunslinger who has come to a small Mexican town to kill the same powerful drug lord who murdered his lover and wounded his hand.  The success of Desperado lies not within its star-power or highly stylized action scenes, but in its ability to entertain a mass audience.  I don't think that this films prequel El Mariachi did that, at least not on a large scale.  Desperado was meant to be a sequel\/remake of El Mariachi except with a new star and a bigger budget and a lot more blood.  The biggest success, I think with this film, is its ability to be watched over and over again without it ever getting boring or loosing any of its flare.  That being said, I've watched Desperado countless times since I first saw it back in 1996 and has not yet lost any of its potency.  Plus it has always been said by many people that the mark of a truly great film lies in its ability to be watched repeatedly without getting boring.  The uniqueness of Desperado lies within its characters and story.  Take for example Steve Buscemi's scene in the beginning before the credits start.  He walks into a bar full of several very shady characters and beguiles them with an interesting story of a lone stranger and the guitar case full of guns that he carries.  The story frightens the Short Bartender (Cheech Marin, as that is who he is credited as playing) who immediately afterwards goes to see if the story checks out.  This is meant to set the tone for the countless, bloody action scenes to follow and also establishes what many of the characters in the film are going to be like. The characters, which is the other half of the films uniqueness, is the best part of the film.  Antonio Banderas is picture perfect in the role.  He doesn't do a whole lot of acting here as many people have already pointed out.  (His guns do most of the acting for him.)  But it perfectly suits his character.  The El Mariachi was meant to be played by an almost emotionless person who was good with a guitar and a pair of hand guns.  Salma Hayek who plays Carolina, the bookstore owner and Banderas' love interest, is good here too.  Steve Buscemi plays well, himself pretty much and is good as well.  Joaquim de Almeida who plays the drug lord, Bucho, is great here too.  The most unique character of course, is that of Pick-up Guy, who is played by none other than Quentin Tarantino himself.  He has one really hilarious scene in this movie shortly before meeting a bloody demise.  The films action scenes, bloody as they may be, actually come off as being too cartoonish to be truly believable.  For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, just watch them.  Take for example, in the scene after Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek have just gotten done making love.  He finds himself on the roof with two guys shooting at him.  He dives backwards off the roof and onto another one, while still managing to kill one of the shooters, all the while they were standing right in front of him and shooting at him.  Or another example would be the shootout in the street between Banderas, his two guitar playing buddies, and many of Bucho's henchmen.  And another thing, why does it seem that people in the film hardly ever run out of ammo?  Strangely enough, the knife-throwing guy is the only person in the movie who doesn't kill people with a gun and is dispatched in probably the only least bloody fashion. Flawless, of course not.  The films largest flaw lies within its plot.  Since this movie is mostly made up of fast and relentlessly bloody action scenes, there really isn't any time for story.  (Though if that was the intention of director Robert Rodriguez or not, I really can't be sure.)  This seems largely why some characters come off as being better developed than others.  Many of the characters, with the exceptions of Banderas, Hayek, and De Almeida, are only on screen for a maximum time of only ten to fifteen minutes and that's it.  (Mostly due to the character being killed off in some very bloody fashion.)  I would like to have learned a little more about Steve Buscemi's character, and how he came to be involved with the El Mariachi and so on.  Get my point?To sum it up, Desperado is a unique and wild shoot 'em up that grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go.

So let a lady step in and point out a few things for those who are interested in viewing this film.This film was actually started in 1978, and finally released in 1981 and I was there to see it. It is based on the adult fantasy sci-fi America version magazine Heavy Metal. The original origin of the magazine is French, very adult, very graphic, very sci-fi, lotsa nudity BUT excellent and compelling storytelling.The key phrase is Adult, Fantasy, Illustrated.Just because its a 'cartoon', does not mean its for kids.Looking at the Animation now in 2002, its dated. In the mid-80's Japanese Anime has set and kept raising the bar on this kind of adult anime genre. This early mainstream American attempt was good, for it had a good model, the magazine, Heavy Metal.If Heavy Metal had waited to be produced until now, with all the advancements on technology, animation, graphics, art we have at our disposal, I only wish that the popular artists and storytellers of the magazine Heavy Metal were involved. It would be a different film indeed, and it would get an NC-17 rating. The only pieces that were trademarks of the Heavy Metal magazine were Soft Landing\/Grimaldi Den and Taarna.More specifically, Taarna WAS exactly what the American Heavy Metal Magazine was all about and uncredited was Jean Giraud who has done a hell of a lot of work in the magazines history....both American and French versions is the cause for that. You may know his work by his other more famous name, Moebius.If you ask me, the film could have gone one of two ways just like the magazine story by story without the silly connector of the green orb, or with just the one story of Taarna. Back in 1978-1981, I would assume the Studio Executives could not venture into that manner without getting squeamish about box office so what we have is a tip-toe cross blend between the two. On one level it works, on another it does not. Its a viewers decision.I like this 1981 version of the movie Heavy Metal, although a few stories didn't live up to the level of the magazine content..or were not presented as such. Neverwhereland should have NEVER been cut, I would have taken it over Captain Stern any day. Neverwhereland seemed to be along the lines of the magazines' content, too bad it wasn't included. Harry Canyon I could have taken or left, made no difference.Additionally, I JUST loved Den and B-17. I loved the soundtrack, for Metal is America. But just like the magazine, it was adult, it was fantasy, violent at points and contained nudity. It was early R Adult Animation American Style. (I know...Fritz the Cat was an X rated Animation that instead of using humans, used felines. Besides, Fritz was Ralph Bakshi's ticket outa Disney Animation and Robert Crumb is the 70's counter culture!)This film, Heavy Metal was also marketed as the male dream Metal Music, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Nudity.But wait...why was I...a woman interested?!?!?It was Taarna. This was the first animated woman in an American made mainstream animated adult feature film that the world needed, that the world depended upon, that was tough, that was independent, not a size four but voluptous, and was still very sexy. Nowadays, it may not mean much, but in 1981 when I was a teen and saw this, it meant a lot. Snow White, she wasn't and was she the Wicked Witch of the West either and that is how women were portrayed up till the release of Heavy Metal.When I read a few stories in the adult magazines Heavy Metal from the late 70's to the early 90's, both American and French versions, the women in the majority of the stories, although drawn by European men and set in uncertain futures, wear...and in many cases...don't wear at all... and involved in explicit sexual situations..the women WERE the heroes!!All in all, keep in mind Heavy Metal was made for an adult audience, just like the magazine. It's not just for the teenaged guys, its not just for the stoned and metal heads, its not just for the trekies or x-filers. It's a good effort for its time but if you're expectting work like in late 80s\/90's Japanese Anime like Katsuhiro Ôtomo's Akira, etc., or 2001's Taro Rin's Metropolis remember its 1981, and American, and NOT quite like its name sake Magazines, but its still good.

Sequels, trilogies, merchandise, you name it. Star Wars (I refuse to call it &#145;A New Hope') has shaped the Hollywood we know today.Star Wars isn't a brilliant film. The plot isn't even particularly original. But what it is (or more specifically was) is a totally groundbreaking exercise in production techniques and values. Nothing like it had ever been seen before and as such, captured the imagination like nothing ever had or ever will again.Even by today's standards, the sets are lavish, the costumes are cool and the characters are just fantastic. You can see why literally everything that appears on screen for even a second has its own action figure. Chewie, the Stormtroopers, Greedo and all the others bristle with imagination and convincingly portray &#145;a galaxy far, far away' for the first time ever. Personally speaking, I don't think it has ever been surpassed in science fiction and probably never will. And that is why the franchise has been successful. It created a whole mythos, with the Jedi, successfully blending hi-tech with old style religions and prophecies. I don't think there will ever be a phenomenon like this again. And, although The Empire Strikes Back is technically a superior film, this remains, in my opinion, one of the biggest milestones in cinematic history. I mean, look at it! It was made in 1977!

His disgruntled son, perhaps mildly autistic, climbs onto the garage roof, clutching the Flecks' prize terrier. Suffice it to say that, in this situation, the negotiator does NOT employ the same masterful suicide-preventing techniques he uses at work. Of course, this same guy is the first of an endless series of ex-lovers that Cookie Fleck runs into, and she doesn't really remember any of them very clearly!

The old sod has absolutely no lines to speak at all, yet he is hysterical, just sitting next to his brainless wife, whose lips are so full of Botox she can hardly utter an intelligible word.The gay couple is spot-on accurate, so real they don't even seem to be acting.

The good thing is it's sort of scary mainly because of that creepy song though.  The bad thing is that the movie really drags and we don't really see any action until the last 30 minutes.  This movie was a little late in time or had too big of a budget.  There are two ways this movie would have made up for all that it lacks and that is if it had been a B-Movie instead or it was made in the 80s but neither of those applies so there is no excuse for the cheesiness we get from the entire movie.

A strong and harrowing depiction of racism and rotten minds who feed it and keep it alive in civilized society. The film is written by David McKenna who has since written films like Blow.Edward Norton and Edward Furlong play brothers in AMERICAN HISTORY X, a brothers who have been taught to support racism since they were just teenagers. Then their father gets killed in the line of duty and Derek, the older (Norton), decides it was all because of blacks and other non-white American people who live in their neighbourhood as well as in the whole America, too. He turns into real devil in the form of human being and starts a gang in their neighbourhood to destroy all the parasites, immigrants.. and becomes hugely popular skinhead leader who is hugely admired by Danny, the younger brother (Furlong). Then a horrific act of violence takes place and things start to take new directions..Rarely have I seen a film about racism made this restrainedly but still extremely harrowingly and memorably. The actors are of course great and Oscar worthy, but the screenplay is the most important thing. There's no humor or lightening elements and the ending is definitely not a traditionally happy and it was just a movie like. The ending is there to strike the viewers even more effectively and force us think and realize. Especially the last speech is important and thickens it all.Also the acts and opinions of the skinheads are written with care and the film doesn't moralize anything which is great. The skinheads really believe in their thing that all other than non-white\/American citizens need to be killed, hurt or otherwise destroyed and removed. When I listen to them I cannot but admire the work of the scriptwriter; even the real skinheads should stop and think do they really want to look so pathetic and ridiculous because they ARE realistically depicted in this film.The music is powerful and sad and makes the images even more powerful and stunning. Kaye is also a cinematographer in this film and it shows as he captures some nice landscapes and uses B&W photography very effectively. There are many extreme close ups of character heads and face expressions which really show how serious all the characters, racists and non-racists, are and I cannot find single one irritating or unnecessary role or actor in this film. The ending is unexpected and very sad. The violence in the ending is also very fierce but it is pretty much symbolic and makes the man who grabs the gun really see what has now been done by him and why. The film includes some very strong scenes of violence but they are never even distantly exploitative or gratuitous but realistic and thus so painful to watch. This is the kind of film which can make viewer turn the eyes off the screen at some points and that is a sign that the message has been delivered and will stay haunting inside the viewer mind and that is also one thing from which a remarkably powerful movie can be recognized.Tony Kaye's film is easily among the greatest and most important Hollywood films of the 1990's. It can be seen universally and won't lose its power too easily during years and as long as this kind of wickedness takes place in the world everyday, these films remain as important as when they were released and should also be seen by many people who don't necessarily understand how serious these things really are not only in this film but in real world, too.

I mean, I thought it was cool when I was a little kid and I saw it, but other than some cool performances from Hulce and Abraham, what has this movie got to offer?  Excerpts from Mozart's most popular stuff you could buy for $2 on any discount classics CD?  It's got director Forman's usual overuse of head shots and quick reaction shots, his usual reliance on audience reactions to carry the supposed impact of a star's performance (as seen also in his lackluster 90s bioflick, Man on the Moon), plus you've got a whopping case of historical falsification.  The whole thing about Salieri murdering Mozart is ridiculous historical fable that's been passed around by people for years, and has less validity than your average second gunner JFK story.

Many viewers refer to it as being childish, boring and uninteresting. Seems to me that it is bound to the same fate of Tolkien's books, destined to be a target for the same type of misunderstandings that keep attacking this literary masterpiece many decades after it's first publication.Having read the books several years ago, I went to see this `impossible' film when it came out with many doubts on my mind. I really liked it, but left the theater with as many doubts as I had before. Was it perfect? Well, maybe not, but what an achievement. After watching it a few times on DVD, and thinking about it for some time now, I find myself loving this film more and more. Let me tell you why...The Lord of the Rings is a fairy-tale of myth and fantasy. Peter Jackson directed a film that was considered, for a very long time, impossible to make, and not only for technical reasons. The narrative roots are incredibly long and detailed, and the storyline is deeply connected with the creation of a fantastic continent from a time unknown called `Middle Earth'. It's author, Tolkien, dedicated a considerable part of his life developing this continent's background, it's mythology and origins, it's different kinds of people, cultures and languages, and therefore it's geographic references are determinant to the unfolding of the story of the One Ring.Peter Jackson went out to achieve the impossible and came out with a recreation of the original that is pure and true to the story in every detail. The first time the four hobbits meet a black rider on the road, for example, is absolutely faithful to the feeling of the book. The assault of the riders at Weathertop is another great example, and it captures that feeling of danger, density and atmosphere that are the main characteristics of the tale. Jackson also took some liberties with the story, and made some right choices along the way. If the so called `purists' may not approve the removal of Tom Bombadil altogether, it should be comprehensible that the travel from Hobbiton to Rivendel is a very long and detailed one and could easily make a movie on it's own. I felt more uneasy with how short the Council of Elrond was. In the book, the council is where the whole story of the rings is first explained, and many passages from the past ages of Middle Earth are unveiled. It is a fascinating moment of the story, that had to be shortened for obvious reasons. Still, after some consideration, I now agree with the options made by Peter Jackson, and think that the movie prologue narrated by Galadriel was the wisest choice. The magic is all there when Gandalf shuts his eyes the moment Frodo stands in the council and says `I will take the ring'. It is there at Moria's Gate, and at the fall of Boromir. It is a powerful film that doesn't fit the rhythm of the standard Hollywood action movie. It is a film that breeds, that takes time to unfold, it's tale branching in every direction.I could go on and on, talking about all the different elements that bring this film close to perfection, but I'll end saying that deep down, this is not about action, beards and big monsters. The greatest thing about this film, to me, is that it brought me back to a time when I was in love with a different world where everything was possible. Reading The Lord of the Rings night after night, I came to understand what this thing of `mankind' really was all about. The corruption of absolute power, the importance and value of friendship, the inevitability of growing up, the strength of hope... That this film could capture that magic, and be a new bearer to it's message of humanism, is a statement to it's greatness. Gandalf's words, that even the smallest person may change the course of the world, and have a part to play in the destiny of all, are immortal.In the end, this is a wonderful film, but that doesn't mean you are going to like it. I cannot tell you what it is like to see this film if you don't know or love the book. But I hope it may plant a seed on your heart to discover a great world of fantasy, beauty and humanity.

The role of Lester Burnham could not have been better played by Kevin Spacey and the diversity of the characters and the storyline with the intertwining sub-plots make this an enjoyable piece of cinema,fully deserving of the accolades and plaudits that it has won. It is brilliantly shot and Sam Mendes fully shows off his talent for writing a realistic and bitter-sweet drama.The range of characters and how they interact with each other is the key to why this film works so well, the audience all know someone who could be likened to a character in the film, although hopefully less extreme. For me this is THE film and the way it manages to touch on so many of todays subjects, several of them still taboo are what makes this a masterpiece in my eyes. People will watch this in the future, only the truly myopic cannot see that.Overall this film filled a void that was apparent in the movie industry and there was nothing like this prior to it and I seriously doubt whether there will be anything similar to proceed this ground and barrier breaking film.
