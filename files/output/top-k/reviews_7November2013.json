Neo's transformation up until the last movie was pretty much the same though. If you like fighting, shooting, philosophical questions, awesomeness, slow-mo, then this is the movie for you. Neo flying at the end was a bit to much but i guess it fits with him being able to conquer the world that once controlled him. the part where NEO enters Agent smith, that part was a bit puzzling for me, I didn't understand why he would have to do that. Neo needed a new body? he came back to life. what was the purpose of he going in to SMITH? I'm sure Neo didn't know he was going to destroy SMITH by going into his body. or else he would've done the same to the other agents that were in front of him. Then again, he was in a hurry to save Trinity and Morpheus. Oh that's right he was, instead of running to his right to get the phone which he had enough time to do. He goes stands there, stops the bullets, runs into SMITH... Trinity and Morpheus hold on... scares the other agents away, then he runs back to the phone. i guess what I'm trying to say is that the ending could have been better and more rewarding. Neo is basically immortal in the Matrix, his heart stopped, nope, come back to life he says. Smith tried to control him, nope, denied he says. If Neo can defy physics by flying, by stopping bullets in mid air, and coming back to life. why not use that power to stop SMITH in the first place, he stopped bullets, what is he using to stopped them. couldn't he use the same power for other stuff or does it only apply to bullets? If Neo had never gone inside Smith, smith wouldn't had multiplied. I guess Smith was needed to move the plot forward for the next two movies. eventually ending the war between man and machine that went on hundreds of years with a lame truce.

It is a joy ride of a film that never lets up with its unbearable suspense and thrilling action.Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a fussy advertising executive. He is then kidnapped by Philip Vandamm (James Mason), a foreign spy who has mistaken him for George Kaplan, a government agent. When Thornhill tries to make sense of the case, Vandamm and his men frame him for murder. Roger is then on the run from both the government and foreign agents as he travels across the country. He is helped along the way by Eve Kendall (Eva Marie-Saint), a mysterious blonde, but she may not be as innocent as she seems.The premise is genius. Hitchcock stated that he loved playing the audience like a piano. The whole movie is almost unbearably suspenseful, and the action sequences are inventive and exciting. The two best action sequences are when Roger is chased by a plane, and the climax on Mount Rushmore. These are two of the best sequences ever put on film, and are never boring for a second.Roger Thornhill is a fantastic hero. He's an intelligent and fussy man who is thrown into all these scrapes, and has to use his wits. Cary Grant is excellent as Thornhill, becoming the character himself.Eva Marie Saint is terrific as Eve. Eve herself is a mysterious and sad but charming woman, and Marie-Saint carries out the character wonderfully. She does not condescend to the role, and is not a mere stereotypical damsel in distress.James Mason is very good as Vandamm. While Vandamm isn't one of the best villains I've ever seen on film, he's still very good. He does feel like a genuinely villainous man, and doesn't overplay it. That can be said for the rest of the film, too. It's not overdone. It has the perfect balance of thrills and humanity for a thriller, and has set a new standard for my expectations from thrillers.

I have never been so wrong about a movie in my entire life. The movie is about a girl named Marion who comes into possession of a lot of money. She decides to steal this money from her boss, instead of taking it to the bank, and head to California to be with her boyfriend Sam. Marion decides to pull over and rest for the night at the Bated Motel, but things are soon not what she thought and things get very crazy at the Bates Motel. Everything about this remake is just wrong. From the awful acting, down to the exact shot-by-shot scenes, it even has the exact same dialogue. These things just ruined the movie. It's such a classic movie loved by so many people, I just can't understand why somebody would want to remake this.The first major problem I had with this Psycho remake was the acting. There isn't even a word to describe how awful and off putting it was. Anne Heche, who played Marion, was just an awful choice. She didn't possess the same it factor as Janet Leigh, the original Marion. Wow, and don't even get me started on Vince Vaughn. Whoever decided to put him in this movie as Norman Bates should be fired immediately! He does absolutely nothing for his role. He doesn't bring the same mysterious quality that Anthony Perkins did. One of the things that I liked most about Anthony Perkins' Norman was that he didn't look like a serial killer, he looked like just a normal guy, and Vince Vaughn didn't bring that to the table. All the performances from almost all the character were just really awkward and cringe worthy.Another problem with this movie is that it is an exact carbon copy of the 1960's classic. If you were to play them side by side that would probably match. There are some little changes to the dialogue so that the story would fit into the 1998 year that the remake takes place. Like one for instance is the amount of money that Marion pays for her car at the used car lot. In the original she pays a lot less, but in the remake she pays about a thousand dollars more. Changes like this make sense and are needed to make the movie fit into this year. I just fell that the director could have done so much more with this film than just make a crappy remake of a classic. He should have made it his own. I don't think anybody will ever successfully remake this film, mostly because it is beloved by so many people and nobody can really capture what Hitchcock did with his version of Psycho.I also loves that the classic movie was in black and white. It added mystery and suspense. The remake just lacked all of these things and was really rather boring.All in all I hated this movie. If you want to cut it off within the first five minutes don't feel bad, because I sure did. The acting and the unknown reason to remake a classic movie shot by shot just made this movie so much worse. Skip this remake and watch the 1960 classic version of Psycho, you will not regret it!

Carpenter remains the father of Michael Myers and what he did on such a restricted budget was amazing.But I still think that, despite the increase in violence, this film is still entertaining and, at times, quite thrilling.Even though she simply spends most of her time in the film running and cowering from Michael Myers\/The Shape (reportedly whilst wearing a wig to match her hair from the first film), I love the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis reprised her role as Laurie Strode. And, despite this, her character still gets developed in a major way that should have drawn the story behind these two 'Halloween' films to a satisfactory close. The other 'Halloween' sequels just aren't the same without their original scream queen, even though she did return for the reunion twenty years after the original and Rick Rosenthal's second stab at the series!But Michael Myers is like Jason Voorhees or Freddy Krueger. He's an unforgettable icon of horror and a human blob for audiences to focus all their personal fears on to. As Carpenter and Loomis would say Evil never dies! Though, I frankly didn't even notice that Nick Castle didn't return to play Myers this time around.Donald Pleasence is, if anything, even more entertaining in this sequel and is always a pleasure to watch as Dr. Sam Loomis -- his most influential role since playing Blofeld in 'You Only Live Twice' (1967), so much so that his willingness to continue playing Loomis makes me wonder why he wasn't recalled to portray the cat-stroking Bond villain, at least in 'Diamonds Are Forever' (1971).Nancy Stephens makes a great return as Loomis' chain-smoking, slightly cynical nurse, Marion Chambers (whose car was attacked by Myers in the first film), whose role I find slightly poignant as the film progresses, as she sets up most of the film's plot. Charles Cyphers also returns briefly as Sheriff Brackett and even Nancy Loomis gets a brief cameo as his daughter, Annie, despite the fact that her character is dead!Lance Guest, who went on to star in the ill-fated 'Jaws The Revenge' (1987) gets quite a good role here but, other than that, most of the characters are (as in most other horror films) set up simply to be cut down. Not that that's a real problem -- this film was probably meant to do to hospitals what 'Psycho' (1960) did to showers!!Admittedly, Rob Zombie's attempt at the hospital chase had a lot more gore and tension to it and didn't drag on for half as much time, but the finale is a real blast and the addition of The Chordettes' song 'Mr. Sandman' is quite catchy, even though it doesn't make much sense in that it's a love song.

Alfred Hitchcock's genre-defining 'Psycho' (1960) got a shot-by-shot remake, so did 'The Producers' (1968), and so did this film. What next, a remake of 'Jaws' (1975), 'The Sting' (1973) or even 'Citizen Kane' (1941) or 'Casablanca' (1942)?!If nothing else, the remake proved that you cannot improve on the casting of the original. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are such a convincing screen couple that you could even believe that they were not acting!! Their respective ages at the time of filming are even consistent with those of a couple desperate to have their own child before it is too late, which lends credence to the plot, unlike the remake. David Warner actually developed the character of Jennings from a one-dimensional character into someone with a bit more seediness and sudden tragedy, so to praise David Thewlis in the remake is to praise him for usurping another's performance! And Billie Whitelaw, though literally the nanny from Hell, is such a fun and malicious character that you don't mind the nagging feeling that people as wealthy and renowned as the Thorns would never allow her near their child! Even Jack Palance's daughter, Holly, gets a very memorable role as the Thorns' original nanny, whilst Leo McKern gives a fanatical performance as archaeologist and exorcist, Carl Bugenhagen, which he would continue into 'Damien Omen II' (1978).The plot itself focuses on the lie that Peck's character, Robert Thorn tells his wife, Kathy (Remick) to conceal the fact that their child was apparently stillborn and that, in desperation, he secretly adopted a child to replace it so as to spare her the overwhelming grief. It's a classic horror\/thriller set-up that you continue to see in original films today.Director, Richard Donner insisted on stripping the script of all glaring Satanic references so as to focus on the inner plight of both Thorn and his wife as they come to suspect that their 'son', Damien (Harvey Stephens - in a role that redefined creepy\/evil children in films and culture, generally) is, shall we say, not quite right. After all, wasn't it the blissfully ignorant Del Boy who took Rodney's advice in naming his own son Damien? Damien lives a happy five years with his adoptive parents before all hell breaks loose and both Robert and Kathy are driven to breaking point.The point of this film (unlike the sequels) is that it is all about interpretation. Is Robert Thorn's lie getting to him? Or is little Damien really a devil incarnate? Most think the latter, but Donner wanted to leave the audience guessing and, in many ways, 'The Omen' is best seen as a standalone film, even though the sequels are certainly worth a look.A key point of this film is the fantastically eerie and bone-chilling musical score by the legendary Jerry Goldsmith, who earned an Academy Award for his work on this film. And rightly so! It is just a shame that Goldsmith, the musical talent behind such films as 'The Planet of The Apes' (1968), 'Chinatown' (1974) and 'Alien' (1979) didn't win one more often!! Go ahead, check your film collection - Goldsmith quite possibly figures in it!And, even though both the fashions and the special effects seem a bit dated, they are part of the charm of the film. Damien inspired a whole (black) mass of imitators and sequels and remakes, but the original truly shines above all of them. Quite clearly inspired by both 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968) and 'The Exorcist' (1973), 'The Omen' delivered at a time when horror films were all the rage. It was very, very lucky to lure in such stars as it did (particularly in terms of securing such classic American actors as Peck and Remick), as horror was something of a dirty word in cinema at the time and, rather than being another American horror film, the politics- heavy plot is set primarily in the UK, with both Italy and Israel providing a further backdrop to the devilish proceedings.The death scenes are great but, unlike the sequels, the focus is not on them. A lot of odd happenings transpire that drive Robert and Kathy literally out of their minds whereas, in the sequels, every odd occurrence is literally a death of some sort.Plus, an interesting point that has not been lost on reviewers is that the fictional Thorn family throughout this and the sequels seems to reflect the real-life Kennedy family. Robert Thorn, alike Joe Kennedy, is American Ambassador to the Court of St. James and the Thorns continue to suffer a succession of tragedies throughout the 'Omen' series until Damien Thorn himself is compared to JFK in the 'Omen III The Final Conflict' (1981).Literally the best in the series, this makes fine Halloween viewing or, if you're like me, you may find this to be a rollicking good psychological thriller for any time of the year -- perhaps one that bears the most re-watching!The only reason that I have not given it 10\/10 is that the technical specifications of the time are not always great. Picture and sound aren't perfect, but aren't even half as flawed as they are in a film like 'Charade' (1966). Really, it's a small complaint for such an entertaining film and I feel overly picky just writing this! So, there seems little more to say, except Ave Satani!

My expectations of the movie got higher when Roger Ebert named it one of the best movies of the 1980's. So recently I finally tried the film out. And I was COMPLETELY blown away.The movie takes place in 1947 Hollywood. Human beings interact directly with cartoon characters, or toons, and they live in a little cartoon town called Toontown. Roger (voiced by Charles Fleischer) is a goofy toon rabbit who finds that his stunning toon wife Jessica (voiced by Kathleen Turner) is playing paddy cake (literally) with Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye), owner of Toontown. The next day, Acme is discovered to have been murdered, and Roger is accused. Enter Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), a cynical private investigator whose brother was murdered by a toon, and this caused Eddie to hate all toons. His job is to prove Roger's innocence, despite his prejudice. Meanwhile, Christopher Lloyd plays Judge Doom, who is out to exterminate Roger, as he is obviously the murderer.I have not read the original Who Censored Roger Rabbit? novel, but this premise is among the most original and creative I've ever heard of for a film. The idea of humans hiring cartoon characters to act out situations is genius. Even more genius is the amazing interaction of the live-action characters with the animated characters. While it had been done in the past, people had not seen it done throughout an entire film before. The interaction is amazing. You do believe that Eddie is picking up Roger by the ears, or that Judge Doom is holding Roger. But what's even more amazing is when a live-action character is in an animated environment. I can't even describe Eddie's scene in Toontown. It has to be seen to be believed. This film has great characters as well. Roger himself is a funny, lovable doofus, and is just as good a character as any Looney Tunes character. Jessica is not only a stunning toon woman, but she's smart and funny as well. Christopher Lloyd is a great actor, and his casting as the insane Judge Doom is perfect. But the character that makes this movie is Eddie Valiant. He's a sad and flawed person, but he has a sense of decency, and is possibly the funniest character next to Roger. Bob Hoskins is perfect in the role, feeling very natural in the role. Despite the somewhat darker than usual nature of the movie, it's not too cynical for kids, because the film understands that it's a family movie. It isn't too stupid for adults, either, because of how smart it is. The movie also has a great sense of comedy. Its situations, characters, and jokes are all funny. I was smiling while watching it for such a long time. The movie manages to be funny and surprisingly exciting. The movie is one of the best film experiences I've ever had. It's a great example of why I love film. I have never enjoyed a comedy so much. Even Monty Python and the Holy Grail wasn't as much fun as this.

I was smiling while watching it for such a long time. The movie manages to be funny and surprisingly exciting. The movie is one of the best film experiences I've ever had. It's a great example of why I love film. I have never enjoyed a comedy so much. Even Monty Python and the Holy Grail wasn't as much fun as this. I love this movie.A+ ","genre":"Animation, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"7 November 2013","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Horror Express is a great little horror film.

One thing I'll say is that this movie is filled with amusing inside jokes; even Christian Slater isn't safe from exemption. There are also references about how dated Chucky is, and his struggle to adapt. It also goes the full comedic route. Chucky gets stoned, fires off the one- liners and is now a comedian. He was firmly into Freddy Krueger territory when it comes to one-liners. The gore will have gore hounds pleased. We get John Ritter with a bunch of pins stuck in his face, slit throats, stabbings. A doll is burned alive in a nasty way, a gory birth. Somebody gets drilled with a truck, gunshot wounds, and more. My personal favorite is a death involving glass shards and a water bed.

With the recent Batman franchise, Nolan became more about the darkness aspect of the story and noticeably amplified the action spectacle, but with his directorial debut Memento, he was all about the mystery. Memento is a great film mainly because of its element of surprise, mystery, and its narrative device. Nolan conducts the story atypically from the end of the story all the way to the beginning, focusing on an array of characters that may or may not have anything to do with the outcome of the story. But is the outcome the first scene (the story's conclusion) or the final scene (the story's beginning)? That is one of the many questions you'll ask yourself when watching Memento for the first time. Seeing it for the first time, I wasn't prepared for the constant mind-race I'd be experiencing. The plot should not be spoiled, so I'll give basic the story's basic framework. Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man suffering from a memory disorder after a man apparently attacked and murdered his wife before knocking him unconscious. Now, Leonard wants to avenge his wife's death, but his memory loss makes it more of a challenge than it already is. Leonard can't hold onto newer memories but has all the ones prior to the incident. To keep with the information about his attacker, Leonard tattoos himself with crucial information in his search for the murderer and takes many Polaroids of the people he meets along the way.That's as far as I'll go in trying to sum up the plot. If you haven't seen it, you don't need to know much else. The story, being told backwards to forwards, intrigues and mystifies, as it should, and heightens the mystery of the entire premise. However, I question the impact the film will have with repeated viewings. Seeing it once and exploring the ins-and-outs of online movie-guides and analyses for Memento, I am seriously skeptical about it being as exhilarating and as gripping as it was the first time around.Despite my speculation of whether or not Memento will hold up for a second viewing, the film should be commended for its intrigue and intricate use of characters and story development. Sometimes the value of characters' motives - and characters themselves - are questionable, making the film tricky to piece together. This is not a criticism because it makes you connect with the stress and confusion of Leonard. The whole thing is akin to a hazy, vigilante\/detective story. Nolan puts us in the position of Leonard so deeply that there's hardly a frame or scene where he isn't there. This gives us the feeling of confinement; the odd and often eerie feeling of embodying a character in a film.Guy Pearce's enticing performance only levies this. Pearce adds the hazy and disoriented qualities of Leonard's character subtly but effectively as she makes the character sympathetic but simultaneously unreliable. With Leonard's severe condition, even his buddy Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) sometimes seems like a complete stranger. This not only leads to an unreliable narrator, but an unreliable cast of characters, seeing as Leonard feels as if he can't trust his own friends and acquaintances due to his condition. The same applies to us.Memento is a great thriller thanks to its mystery and high-levels of intrigue. The great performances of Pearce, Pantoliano, and Carrie Anne-Moss as a woman Leonard meets during his search. The scene that rings in my head the most from the film is when Teddy informs Leonard that even if he does kill the person responsible, it isn't like he'll remember it. Leonard has the most logical response there could be. My wife deserves vengeance. Doesn't make a difference whether I know about it. Starring Guy Peace, Joe Pantoliano, and Carrie Anne-Moss.

","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"7 November 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Robert Altman made great films, such as Nashville, The Player, and McCabe and Mrs. Miller. What defined these movies was a great and engaging script that kept the audience involved for the entire film. Such is not the case with Buffalo Bill And The Indians. It as if Altman was in too much of a rush to make this film, because he wanted to make a statement about Native American history. There were a lot of interesting bit roles in this film, but these characters were never developed very well. I felt robbed that not much time was devoted to explaining them a little more. Altman assumed that the audience understood that it was 1885 and the Wild West was now tamed. That was clear, but still I feel that the film would have been much stronger if it began with a flashback to nine years before, explaining where each of these characters were at the time. That way we would have had more understanding for the points Altman was making. For example, it is hard to believe that the great actor from the Heche days, Burt Lancaster, was reduced to this engaging and enigmatic role, who waxing philosophically, but we have no idea who he is and how he relates to Buffalo Bill. This is the downside of this film. The script seems winding. There is a lot of dull time where one is just yawning and wondering when this movie will start going somewhere. Is that part of the point of the film? Altman never makes it clear. It is quite possible the point was that this town in the prairie had basically become filled with bored, opportunistic townies who sought significance even if it was tormenting someone by hanging him up on a rope and swinging him like a baby. In many ways this movie was uneven. For example, the ideas were brilliant. The idea was that Buffalo Bill was no longer the man he once was, but now just a money grubbing tool who made up myths and tales about his exploits. Buffalo Bill must have been a very handsome and engaging man in real life. He may well have been a great actor and promoter. You could not help like Buffalo Bill, and Paul Newman plays him brilliantly. Bill was also very childish, probably an alcoholic, who used to have infantile temper tantrums. The racial arrogance was also very clear. Buffalo Bill was very happy to exploit the myth that Native Americans were just 'savages who brutalized women'.

Although he was the Great White Father, he was mainly about finding a way to win re-election and defeat his opponents. There was another beautiful moment, where a woman sang an opera song, and the camera showed the various reactions of members of the audience.

The film engaged me in listening to the characters and knowing what they felt. I wanted to know what Mrs. Wilkinson was feeling as she realized what great talent billy had and i also wanted to know what was going to happen once Billy's father had found out and what Mrs. Wilkinson did to try and keep billy at the ballet lessons. When his father finally let go of his emotions towards Billy's going to ballet and excepted him for it on the cold Christmas night it was great to watch. When Billy's dad chose to boycott the strike and go back to work it showed how much love he had for his son and knew that if ballet was truly what Billy wanted to do he would not stop him.

It is a classic in the form of the film. Black and white but already bigger wider screen, and the film permits good image quality so that it can work on a mass of people and on detail in the set or the costumes. They can also have that poor Marty running and dancing across a street with a wide shot. At the time television, we have the Ed Sullivan Show in one scene, could not have done that due to its low definition.This film is all the more important because it is on such works that Marshall McLuhan built a whole theory about hot and cool media. The cinema is hot because of the high definition, the wide screen and the wide shots, whereas television is cool because of the low definition and the image concentrating on one character if not a close-up shot. The picture of the Ed Sullivan Show is typical Ed Sullivan filling the whole screen.It is funny to read all that theory built on such a film and the black and white television with an oblong screen. What is most surprising is that McLuhan could not imagine what high definition TV and DVD could be. If you really want to see the difference with today's TV you watch the series Lost high definition and big screen permit wide pictures, a lot of action and numerous characters with a lot of detail. But Television enables the director to use a lot of flashbacks and flash- forwards that a cinema film could not sustain because a film has to have a rather tight timeline. Pulp Fiction is one rare film that does not follow a timeline within the plot but cut it up and jumbles the pieces. But it is one film, even one exception. The series Lost is entirely built on jumping backward and forward at every single moment. Note this is all the more possible because of the pauses in the shooting due to the presence of advertising.

This is especially odd, as the plot isn't even especially complex, it's just presented in an needlessly complicated way. Still, all story and screenplay issues are easily redeemed by the thrilling action scenes and nifty (and dated) espionage scenes.Ethan Hunt, framed for murdering his entire mission team, is out to clear his name. And while that's the gist of the film, it is very possible that you won't understand what's going on for significant portions of the film.There are several twists throughout the film, but few of them really register as surprising or stunning, as the audience is often scratching their heads, wondering what just happened. Mission Impossible does not have a strong story, but it's made worse by a poor script and convoluted story-telling.Thankfully, the action scenes are fun enough to make one temporarily forget the filler in-between. Sure, they're all a bit ridiculous (not to tell a bad joke, but Mission Improbable anyone?), but they're reasonably entertaining, and at times, highly suspenseful. Still, one feels like the impact of the action scenes could've been heightened by more interesting characters. There is not a single memorable character in this film (with one exception, though it would be a spoiler to say whom this character is). The characters have absolutely no personality, which hurts the film dramatically.As a result of the bland characters, the performances are bland, but at least serviceable. The actors and actresses try to get as much out of their weak characters as possible, but it doesn't make anybody more memorable. The score, composed by Danny Elfman (utilizing themes by Lalo Schifrin) is really fun at times. The use of the Mission Impossible theme is great, but the score doesn't rely entirely on the use of this theme, which is refreshing for a film like this. The only problem with the score (which doesn't have anything to do with Elfman himself) is the ear-bleedingly terrible arrangement of the Mission Impossible theme during the credits by Larry Mullen, Jr. and Adam Clayton.While Mission Impossible is heavily convoluted and not especially original (one scene involving a telephone call is highly reminiscent of 1993's The Fugitive), but there's enough entertaining action sequences to make up for this.

Still, all story and screenplay issues are easily redeemed by the thrilling action scenes and nifty (and dated) espionage scenes.Ethan Hunt, framed for murdering his entire mission team, is out to clear his name. And while that's the gist of the film, it is very possible that you won't understand what's going on for significant portions of the film.There are several twists throughout the film, but few of them really register as surprising or stunning, as the audience is often scratching their heads, wondering what just happened. Mission Impossible does not have a strong story, but it's made worse by a poor script and convoluted story-telling.Thankfully, the action scenes are fun enough to make one temporarily forget the filler in-between. Sure, they're all a bit ridiculous (not to tell a bad joke, but Mission Improbable anyone?), but they're reasonably entertaining, and at times, highly suspenseful. Still, one feels like the impact of the action scenes could've been heightened by more interesting characters. There is not a single memorable character in this film (with one exception, though it would be a spoiler to say whom this character is). The characters have absolutely no personality, which hurts the film dramatically.As a result of the bland characters, the performances are bland, but at least serviceable. The actors and actresses try to get as much out of their weak characters as possible, but it doesn't make anybody more memorable. The score, composed by Danny Elfman (utilizing themes by Lalo Schifrin) is really fun at times. The use of the Mission Impossible theme is great, but the score doesn't rely entirely on the use of this theme, which is refreshing for a film like this. The only problem with the score (which doesn't have anything to do with Elfman himself) is the ear-bleedingly terrible arrangement of the Mission Impossible theme during the credits by Larry Mullen, Jr. and Adam Clayton.While Mission Impossible is heavily convoluted and not especially original (one scene involving a telephone call is highly reminiscent of 1993's The Fugitive), but there's enough entertaining action sequences to make up for this. Mission Impossible isn't exactly sophisticated fare, nor is it as breezily fun as other popcorn flicks. But it's got enough thrills to justify a watch- and enough issues to justify a pass.
