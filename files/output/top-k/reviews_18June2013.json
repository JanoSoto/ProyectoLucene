This is basically what happened when I watched Memento. I went into this movie dry. I didn't know much about it other than it is about a man with memory loss and he tries to avenge his wife. That is basically the story but it sort of plays backwards. I watched this movie on recommendation by a few friends and when I heard Christopher Nolan was involved I was sold. Without further ado here is Memento.Like I said the story is kind of backwards. The movie starts with a lot of confusion but as the scenes progress a few questions get answered with even more questions. The big overall question is, who killed Leonard wife and who is responsible for the situation he is in? Leonard is a husband out for revenge but has severe short term memory loss. We are introduced to a lot in the first few scenes including Trinity form the Matrix and the bald guy from Baby's Day Out. As the story unfoldswe understand their importance and the story slowly starts to makesense. The only flaw I see in the movie is that it really drags and thebeginning is very slow. I wanted to watch the entire movie but it took me a little while to get into it and really into the story. To make it even worse I paused it to go to the bathroom and before I did I thought the movie would be wrapping up soon. Little did I know I was only about an hour into it with a little over an hour left. I did enjoy the movie once I got into it but it felt like I was watching it for six hours. The characters themselves were nothing short of hit or miss. The unpredictability of them was what I enjoyed the most. Leonard was a little bland but it made sense because he was always confused. Obviously he was confused because he suffers from memory loss so his simplicity was expected. He has tattoos all over his body and writes things down on pictures so he remembers what happened the day before. It is really a brilliant idea and we see the severity of his obsession on finding the man responsible for everything. Natalie started out as a really strong character I really enjoyed but there was one scene where I really didn't expect her to do what she did. That was where she takes advantage of Lenny. It was really unexpected but I thought that whole scene was great and it made the story that much clearer. My favorite character in the entire movie is Teddy. I love the actor, I think he is very underrated but fits best as a secondary role rather than a star. His actions are unclear because on the back of his photo it says don't believe his lies so his intentions are unclear. It is another huge question throughout the movie. He randomly appears everywhere always advising Lenny to leave town. He is always involved in some way and he does an amazing job in dragging me into the story. Once I got into the story I was stuck in place and I wasn't going anywhere. Throughout the story there are a bunch of scenes in black and white where Leonard is on the phone telling a story about Sammy. The big question in my mind is how it was relevant to the story but I liked those scenes a lot better than any others. Maybe I liked the psychological aspect of memory loss and in these scenes we dive deep into the condition and the character of Leonard himself. This is where he shows his colors as a normal person and the type of man he was. If you see this movie and are bored with the chain of events and how it constantly backtracks take my advice, stick with it. The ending to this movie is mind blowing and what I really love about movies. Movies can play with your mind and make you believe one thing so strongly then completely switch it up in a matter of minutes. The final scenes to this movie answer everything and it all makes sense. We see the true intentions of each character and we get resolution in the story and it was very satisfying. I was thinking how I would have liked to see everything in order but if I did I probably would have hated the movie. Overall, Memento is a unique movie with an interesting enough premise to make me sit though the drag of the first act. I loved the black and white affect and the writing of the story. Christopher Nolan was involved so I had high hopes and he did not disappoint. The characters were good for the most part. I would have liked to see a little more form a few but the movie dragged enough as it was. The second act was a lot better than the first and the third blew me away. The acting was good for the most part, no Oscar worthy performances but it did get the job done. The ending did save this movie from being a wreck because if that failed then all the events prior would have been for nothing and a waste of time. Memento gets the WillyT Recommendation for its uniqueness and originality. The risk taken in the movie did pull off and is something I could easily watch again and probably should so I can make sense if it completely.

Brosnan wrote Future Tense one of the most readable books on the history of science fiction cinema ever written . He also wrote a highly regarded column in the SF magazine Starburst which over the years degenerated in to a soapbox where Brosnan stated his hatred for both STAR TREK and the works of James Herbert at every opportunity .

The basic plot outline is that some schoolgirls and a teacher disappear while on a picnic to a local landmark. Attempts to find them are unsuccessful, and the mystery is never explained. I find this interesting because there are several real-life events that are somewhat like this, for example the Dyatlov Pass incident and the Mary Celeste. And indeed, what is interesting about the events is not the explanation, but the mystery itself, so the fact that the mystery remains unresolved at the end of the film doesn't bother me.However, despite its potential, several things about this film do not work, in my opinion. First of all, the time period and setting are not executed convincingly. I can't really put my finger on it, but there is an artificial feel to the film and its characters that makes it impossible to believe that these are real people in a real time period. Granted, the characters are fictional, but the film fails to effectively create the illusion of a cohesive reality.In addition to this, the film is rather heavy-handed with its delivery of themes. For example, setting the picnic on Valentine's Day seemed unnecessary. The description of the rock as the girls are riding in the carriage is another overly blunt attempt at symbolism Siliceous lava forced up from deep down below... Yeah yeah, repressed Victorian sexuality, whatever. This is the sort of thing much better shown through actions and visuals than communicated so directly. The repetition of important lines at later points in the film also seemed over-the- top and unnecessary. Clearly the director did not trust the viewers enough to let them figure this stuff out for themselves.Finally, the film suffered from plotting and pacing issues. In contrast to some of the reviewers here, I actually thought the film had too much action, not too little. Despite its slow-moving feel, the film actually jumps from one event to the next for the entire film. First the girls disappear, then there's the investigation, then Michael and Albert return to the rock, then Michael is found by Albert, then Irma is found, and so on and so on. It's like the writer is afraid we'll get bored with the film if we don't have something new to consider every few minutes. Unfortunately, all these peripheral events distract from the film's essence and diffuse its energy, leaving little time to fully explore the strangeness of the first disappearance or its effects on the remaining characters.To conclude, though built on an intriguing premise, this film lacked the subtlety, insight, and craftsmanship necessary to develop its premise in any meaningful way.

","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance"},{"date":"18 June 2013","score":"21 out of 40 people found the following review useful","review":" Martin Scorsese is one of those directors whose work I just don't seem to get. His films are not totally inaccessible, like most of the work of Stanley Kubrick, but sitting through a Scorsese production is often an exercise that pendulums back and forth between crashing boredom and utter incomprehensibility.Of course, everyone knows by now that TAXI DRIVER is about isolation. Specifically the isolation of one man in the midst of a bustling city. Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a Viet Nam veteran, applies for a job driving a taxi in New York on the graveyard shift; the reason he gives for wanting the job is that he does not sleep at night. That anyone would hire him to actually drive a vehicle under those conditions seems odd, but then everything about Bickle is odd. Clearly he suffers from a profound sense of isolation, but most of that is of his own making, since when it comes to social interaction this guy is so clueless that he makes burnout Reverend Jim from the television show Taxi seem like Albert Einstein by comparison.Travis finds himself attracted to Betsy, a woman working on the presidential campaign of a politician (Cybill Shepherd, proving yet again that she cannot act her way out of a cream puff factory), and he has sufficient social skills to get her to agree to a movie date. Then he takes her to a XXX porn film. Of course she cannot get out of there fast enough, and he is totally bewildered; in his mind it was a perfect date movie.A good deal of the story is told via Travis's inner thoughts, spoken by De Niro on the soundtrack. This device was old even in 1976, and there is too much of it; the audience is already alienated from this man, and having his thoughts overdubbed places him even farther from anything remotely approaching understanding.Possibly the best scenes in the movie are the ones with Jodie Foster as Iris, a twelve-year-old prostitute whom Travis attempts to rescue from what he sees as a sordid life. Iris is possibly the most interesting person in the film; Foster plays her as a girl walking a tightrope between what she has to do to survive and the necessity to avoid danger; she is receptive to Travis at first, but even a twelve-year-old can see that this guy is not playing with a full deck. And at least she breathes some life into an unbearably tedious movie.Which brings us to De Niro. He's good here, but he's much better elsewhere; watching him I had the impression that Scorsese went to one of two extremes either he gave the actor no direction at all and let him do as he pleased, or he micromanaged every nuance of the character and in the process sucked the life out of it. Whatever, the result is a stilted and peculiar bit of acting that seems beneath a major talent like De Niro. Yes, we get Travis's isolation, but we never know what caused it, or why he is just so damn WEIRD.And of course, as is Scorsese's habit, all of this is presented under the guise of gritty reality (think GOODFELLAS and RAGING BULL, both of which ram gritty reality down the viewer's throat until the urge to run screaming from the theater is almost overwhelming).I am a native of New York City; I was born there and lived there until I was forty-two. Martin Scorsese is also a native of the City, but I do not recognize the picture of NYC he paints in this film at all. The simple answer is that we are seeing the City through Travis Bickle's eyes, but while he describes what he sees, we never find out WHY he sees things the way he does; it is perhaps the most frustrating aspect of a very frustrating film.Great film? Depends on which critic you ask. The late Roger Ebert loved it. Leonard Maltin thinks it's awful. I suspect that, like most of Scorsese's oeuvre, this is one of those movies you either love or you hate. Well, I didn't exactly HATE it, but most of it is insufferably boring. De Niro presents us with a wacko character but fails to provide a provenance for his behavior. About the only good thing I can say about Cybill Shepherd is that her role is brief; she's absolutely PAINFUL to watch. It is only Jodie Foster, all of twelve years old yet wearing an ancient expression in her eyes that tells the story of where this girl has been, that draws and holds the audience's attention; honestly, without Foster the film would have no life at all.And possibly the worst of it is that Bickle's increasing descent into violence is left totally unexplained.

His films are not totally inaccessible, like most of the work of Stanley Kubrick, but sitting through a Scorsese production is often an exercise that pendulums back and forth between crashing boredom and utter incomprehensibility.Of course, everyone knows by now that TAXI DRIVER is about isolation. Specifically the isolation of one man in the midst of a bustling city. Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a Viet Nam veteran, applies for a job driving a taxi in New York on the graveyard shift; the reason he gives for wanting the job is that he does not sleep at night. That anyone would hire him to actually drive a vehicle under those conditions seems odd, but then everything about Bickle is odd. Clearly he suffers from a profound sense of isolation, but most of that is of his own making, since when it comes to social interaction this guy is so clueless that he makes burnout Reverend Jim from the television show Taxi seem like Albert Einstein by comparison.Travis finds himself attracted to Betsy, a woman working on the presidential campaign of a politician (Cybill Shepherd, proving yet again that she cannot act her way out of a cream puff factory), and he has sufficient social skills to get her to agree to a movie date. Then he takes her to a XXX porn film. Of course she cannot get out of there fast enough, and he is totally bewildered; in his mind it was a perfect date movie.A good deal of the story is told via Travis's inner thoughts, spoken by De Niro on the soundtrack. This device was old even in 1976, and there is too much of it; the audience is already alienated from this man, and having his thoughts overdubbed places him even farther from anything remotely approaching understanding.Possibly the best scenes in the movie are the ones with Jodie Foster as Iris, a twelve-year-old prostitute whom Travis attempts to rescue from what he sees as a sordid life. Iris is possibly the most interesting person in the film; Foster plays her as a girl walking a tightrope between what she has to do to survive and the necessity to avoid danger; she is receptive to Travis at first, but even a twelve-year-old can see that this guy is not playing with a full deck. And at least she breathes some life into an unbearably tedious movie.Which brings us to De Niro. He's good here, but he's much better elsewhere; watching him I had the impression that Scorsese went to one of two extremes either he gave the actor no direction at all and let him do as he pleased, or he micromanaged every nuance of the character and in the process sucked the life out of it. Whatever, the result is a stilted and peculiar bit of acting that seems beneath a major talent like De Niro. Yes, we get Travis's isolation, but we never know what caused it, or why he is just so damn WEIRD.And of course, as is Scorsese's habit, all of this is presented under the guise of gritty reality (think GOODFELLAS and RAGING BULL, both of which ram gritty reality down the viewer's throat until the urge to run screaming from the theater is almost overwhelming).I am a native of New York City; I was born there and lived there until I was forty-two. Martin Scorsese is also a native of the City, but I do not recognize the picture of NYC he paints in this film at all. The simple answer is that we are seeing the City through Travis Bickle's eyes, but while he describes what he sees, we never find out WHY he sees things the way he does; it is perhaps the most frustrating aspect of a very frustrating film.Great film? Depends on which critic you ask. The late Roger Ebert loved it. Leonard Maltin thinks it's awful. I suspect that, like most of Scorsese's oeuvre, this is one of those movies you either love or you hate. Well, I didn't exactly HATE it, but most of it is insufferably boring. De Niro presents us with a wacko character but fails to provide a provenance for his behavior. About the only good thing I can say about Cybill Shepherd is that her role is brief; she's absolutely PAINFUL to watch. It is only Jodie Foster, all of twelve years old yet wearing an ancient expression in her eyes that tells the story of where this girl has been, that draws and holds the audience's attention; honestly, without Foster the film would have no life at all.And possibly the worst of it is that Bickle's increasing descent into violence is left totally unexplained. It would be easy to assume that it was his Viet Nam service that unhinged him, but the movie does not play that way and at any rate if that were the case it would have been an easy matter to communicate it.

The film is told as a look back of the life of a death row corrections officer, Paul Edgecomb, during the Great Depression of the 1930's, and the supernatural actions that took place during his employment with the penitentiary.The plot of the film, The Green Mile, begins at the Cold Mountain Penitentiary and the corrections officer, Paul Edgecomb played by Tom Hanks, is in charge of death row, also known as the green mile, and the inmates that are housed there. Paul works with three other officers Brutus Brutal Howell played by David Morse, Harry Terwilliger played by Jeffrey DeMunn, and Dean Stanton played by Barry Pepper. John Coffey played by Michael Clarke Duncan, is an inmate on death row that has been accused of the rape and murder of two white little girls. John Coffey's appearance is intimidating, as he is eight feet tall and huge, however he is very shy, soft-spoken, emotional, kind hearted, and scared individual. This is where one theme is presented in the film; you should not judge a book by its cover.While Paul is watching over John he witnesses acts of super natural ability that John performs by healing Paul's urinary tract infection and bringing a mouse back to life that was killed. Eventually John heals the Warden Hal Moores's, played by James Cromwell, terminally ill wife that is dying of cancer. This is another theme presented in the film, to use your gifts wisely. When John is questioned about his super natural ability to heal he replies that he took it back. Paul befriends John and tries to find out what happened to the two small girls, John states that he punished the bad men, but couldn't take it back. John than takes Paul's hand, gives Paul apart of him, and shows Paul what really happened to the two girls. John was only trying to heal them. When it is time for John's execution, Paul is torn with letting him go or continuing with the execution. John is tired of all the pain and is ready to be executed. John takes the last mile, which is the walk from his cell to the execution chamber. After the execution, Paul goes on and lives to be 108 years old- a sure side effect of John giving a part of himself to Paul. However, John feels like his long life is a punishment from God for killing one of his miracles, and wonders how long it will be before he dies.There are many themes in the film, The Green Mile, from God's calling for you, quilt or regret, miracles, wrongly accused, life after death, healing and forgiveness. The calling from God, when John touched Paul, Paul changed. Paul carried a lot of quilt and regret for allowing John, a miracle from God, to be executed. John Coffey was able to heal and restore life. Another film that deals with quilts or regrets, God's calling for you, life after death, healing and forgiveness is the film, Dead Man Walking.Dark lighting used in the film, The Green Mile, represents fear and hope of the inmates. Hope for forgiveness and life after death. The light lightning, such as sunlight, represents the innocence of the two little girls that were raped and murdered. The colors used by the director were dull colors that represent the Great Depression and death row for the inmates. The motif presented in the film is the way John's takes it back, takes the bad or illness from someone. This is presented several times and involves John inhaling the badness or illness out of the other person, he inhales it, coughs it up and it comes out in a black mass.According to Paul from The Green Mile 1999, And my curse is knowing that I'll be there to see it. It's my atonement, you see &#x97; it's my punishment for letting' John Coffey ride the lightning. For killing a miracle of God You'll be gone like all the others, and I'll have to stay. Oh, I'll die eventually; of that, I'm sure. I have no illusions of immortality. But I will have wished for death long before Death finds me. In truth I wish for it already. On the day of my judgment, when I stand before God, and he asks me why&#x85;did I&#x85;did I kill one of his true&#x85; miracles&#x85;.what am I going to say? That it was my job? It was my job&#x85;.. This is a great quote from Paul that hits the nail on the head about the themes presented in the film, The Green Mile.

The film is told as a look back of the life of a death row corrections officer, Paul Edgecomb, during the Great Depression of the 1930's, and the supernatural actions that took place during his employment with the penitentiary.The plot of the film, The Green Mile, begins at the Cold Mountain Penitentiary and the corrections officer, Paul Edgecomb played by Tom Hanks, is in charge of death row, also known as the green mile, and the inmates that are housed there. Paul works with three other officers Brutus Brutal Howell played by David Morse, Harry Terwilliger played by Jeffrey DeMunn, and Dean Stanton played by Barry Pepper. John Coffey played by Michael Clarke Duncan, is an inmate on death row that has been accused of the rape and murder of two white little girls. John Coffey's appearance is intimidating, as he is eight feet tall and huge, however he is very shy, soft-spoken, emotional, kind hearted, and scared individual. This is where one theme is presented in the film; you should not judge a book by its cover.While Paul is watching over John he witnesses acts of super natural ability that John performs by healing Paul's urinary tract infection and bringing a mouse back to life that was killed. Eventually John heals the Warden Hal Moores's, played by James Cromwell, terminally ill wife that is dying of cancer. This is another theme presented in the film, to use your gifts wisely. When John is questioned about his super natural ability to heal he replies that he took it back. Paul befriends John and tries to find out what happened to the two small girls, John states that he punished the bad men, but couldn't take it back. John than takes Paul's hand, gives Paul apart of him, and shows Paul what really happened to the two girls. John was only trying to heal them. When it is time for John's execution, Paul is torn with letting him go or continuing with the execution. John is tired of all the pain and is ready to be executed. John takes the last mile, which is the walk from his cell to the execution chamber. After the execution, Paul goes on and lives to be 108 years old- a sure side effect of John giving a part of himself to Paul. However, John feels like his long life is a punishment from God for killing one of his miracles, and wonders how long it will be before he dies.There are many themes in the film, The Green Mile, from God's calling for you, quilt or regret, miracles, wrongly accused, life after death, healing and forgiveness. The calling from God, when John touched Paul, Paul changed. Paul carried a lot of quilt and regret for allowing John, a miracle from God, to be executed. John Coffey was able to heal and restore life. Another film that deals with quilts or regrets, God's calling for you, life after death, healing and forgiveness is the film, Dead Man Walking.Dark lighting used in the film, The Green Mile, represents fear and hope of the inmates. Hope for forgiveness and life after death. The light lightning, such as sunlight, represents the innocence of the two little girls that were raped and murdered. The colors used by the director were dull colors that represent the Great Depression and death row for the inmates. The motif presented in the film is the way John's takes it back, takes the bad or illness from someone. This is presented several times and involves John inhaling the badness or illness out of the other person, he inhales it, coughs it up and it comes out in a black mass.According to Paul from The Green Mile 1999, And my curse is knowing that I'll be there to see it. It's my atonement, you see &#x97; it's my punishment for letting' John Coffey ride the lightning. For killing a miracle of God You'll be gone like all the others, and I'll have to stay.

On the day of my judgment, when I stand before God, and he asks me why&#x85;did I&#x85;did I kill one of his true&#x85; miracles&#x85;.what am I going to say? That it was my job? It was my job&#x85;.. This is a great quote from Paul that hits the nail on the head about the themes presented in the film, The Green Mile.

It's like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema, never happened, or as some want you to believe, doesn't matter. I can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately, under the influence of liquid refreshments, admit to having affection for the film, but socially in a circle environment? Not a bit of it! I have no such problems admitting my love for the film, I love it as much now as I approach 50, as I did when I sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997.You jump - I jump.Titanic is far from flawless, where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky. While it's true as well that away from Rose and Jack the characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is Rose and Jack's story, fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half. The tie-in to the present day is superbly constructed by James Cameron - the search for the diamond - the real life filming of the Titanic wreckage - and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful Gloria Stuart as old Rose, and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measure.Never let go.So may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever. The band playing on, the captain awaiting his fate, the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them, the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in, or just Jack and Rose, polar opposites in society's class structure, making love, making art or just professing that neither will ever let go.

I felt the Martians character was creepy and somehow really fun, I watched it over and over again but never got bored. But after about 15 years and watching it again yesterday, my point of view about 'Mars Attacks!' suddenly change. This is a type of movie that gives different impression if you watched it in 1990s and nowadays. May be in 1996 or few years after, 'Mars Attacks!' is still fine and exceptional for viewers but it's boring and silly when viewers watch these days. In other words, this movie gets old for young generation.The storyline itself is more like B-movie. It has no heart and chemistry between their entire casts. I have no idea what was Tim Burton purpose by directing this poor movie. It's one of his worst movie I've ever seen, even worse than 'Dark Shadows'. The only thing that could save this movie is their casts. They didn't act remarkably though but it's fun to see star like Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Benning, Pierce Brosnan, Danny De Vito and Michael J. Fox in a movie. And don't forget, it also had young artists that becomes popular these days like Natalie Portman, Jack Black and Sarah Jessica Parker. Overall, 'Mars Attacks!' is not a film that audience would enjoy nowadays, the more years you watch it, the more you dislike this movie. It's different with classic movie like 'Godfather', 'Star Wars' or 'Jurassic Park' that never gets old and everyone could still enjoy even for future generation.

We're following a character down the street; something's around the corner, we don't know what it is, neither does he...That's still one of my favorite things about it. It's also a lot about sex - but it all feels very cold for us in the audience; nothing ever feels sexy. When I thought over Kubrick's films, this at first seemed an odd choice. Then I realized he has depicted sex a lot - but always in very non-erotic ways. For instance, Lolita is about an older man's desperate desire for a young girl. But it's his doomed attempt at finding happiness through possessing her that endures in the mind, not anything sexual.Eyes Wide Shut depicts many characters trying to, or having sex with each other - but never in ways that seem sexy. One undercurrent is that people are, or are trying to, feed on one another, in an almost animal-like way.Another theme is a husband, Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) trying to find a safe sexual outlet outside of his marriage, outside his wife (Nicole Kidman). Perhaps reflecting the fears of the times, almost every one he finds turn out to be potentially deadly.There's also a secret society engaged in satanic sex rituals.We are left questioning whether or not a woman was murdered after she offered herself as some kind of sacrifice in the doctor's place, when he is uncovered as an outsider who doesn't belong at their party. Questions left unanswered include why do they allow the doctor to see and learn so much about them? And why would this woman do this (if, in fact, she does)?Sydney Pollack's character Victor Ziegler may be the clue to our unraveling what's happening just on a simple narrative level. Take a close look at what he's doing right before doctor Bill enters his upstairs chamber, at the first party . For me, it confirmed my fears of about what Ziegler tells the doctor towards the end of the film (a scene that has my vote as the most frightening, diabolical dialogue scene of the decade). We'd like to believe Ziegler is telling Dr. Harford the truth - but the assurance we would feel if we knew he was is denied us.The mystery surrounding the secret society is more compelling than the story that frames it, so when the conclusion returns to the issues the doctor and his wife are trying to resolve, things feel less interesting. Maybe this was another joke Kubrick was making - obsessions over sex can sometimes leave one with anti-climactic feelings.
