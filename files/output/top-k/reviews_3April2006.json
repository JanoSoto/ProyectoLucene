It's not just that I couldn't sleep it's that I couldn't stop thinking about it. And here I am, up again, writing this review. Requiem for a Dream is a masterpiece of a modern cinema! It is one of those rare movies that can truly move you. It gives you the chills, it makes you think! Ellen Burstyn is so real that at the moments I felt like I wanted to extend my arm and help her. Her acting in this movie was breathtaking. The talk she is having with Jared Leto about her being lonely is one of the best performances by an actress I have ever seen on the screen. It's all there on here face, sadness and loneliness mixed up with hopes and dreams. Absolutely brilliant! And what is more important this movie is not just about addiction, it is about dreams, hopes and solitude. And much, much more! Definitely a must see! 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 April 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Wow!

SOME FRIGGIN TUNA FISH CAN'T HEAR RIGHT. The CORRECT line is Aha. Well, that's always how it goes. FIX IT! OR MY SHOES AREN'T GOING BACK ON! I am not pleased at ALL. There is also a typographical error in one of the memorable quotes that I can't remember at the moment, but there is a word spelled WRONG and I do NOT appreciate it! This movie is a CLASSIC. People do not appreciate it enough. From the eloquent dialog to the impeccable animation, this movie continues to wow me each and every time I watch it. My life would not be the same without this movie. Without it, I would spend hours on end in the corner of my garage in tears. So thank you Looney Tunes. Thank you Michael Jordan. And thank you so very much Warner Brothers. You are all a little delicious piece of Heaven's shoelaces.
