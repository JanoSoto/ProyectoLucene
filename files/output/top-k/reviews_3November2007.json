It appears this movie has been in the IMDb Bottom 100 for quite some time! Some films are in there for a while, but then drop out, as their rating increases slightly, not that I'm saying that means they're any good. However, Baby Geniuses is one of those films that seems to remain up there (or down there). I may not dislike this total flop as strongly as many do, but like the vast majority of people who have ever seen it, I got absolutely nothing out of it! Dr. Kinder and Dr. Heap are members of a company called Babyco. They are secretly studying babies and their communication, so they can learn the secrets of the universe! After a highly intelligent baby in their secret lab named Sly manages to escape, he goes out to form an army of babies from outside the lab to help free those being held captive inside! This is supposed to be a comedy, but since I didn't laugh or even smile once, I can't give it any credit as such. Now, I will admit that I thought it could have been worse. I think the diaper gravy part grossed me out a bit, and still does when I think back to it, but also feel that this movie would have been worse had the excretion jokes been more extreme, like the ones in a rightfully obscure cartoon show called Mega Babies. Unfortunately, I sound like I'm defending Baby Geniuses now, but I can assure you, just because I say it could have been worse doesn't mean I'm saying it's not bad! So many others have criticised it for being stupid and boring, as well as having a bad script and bad acting, and I certainly can't deny any of these things! I also think it's a bit strange, in a way I can't really describe.As displeased as I was by this film, it wouldn't feel right for me to go with over 50% of the other IMDb voters and give it a 1\/10, as it was a tad too forgettable to be my worst movie experience. I'm not even sure about my 2 rating, and might be able to give it a 3. However, that's still far from a positive rating, and I can say without ANY doubt in my mind that it was NOT worth it! Should kids watch this film? That's debatable, but since I'm not a parent, it's not my decision. I feel I should just mention that it's not 100% clean. For adults, however, Baby Geniuses is hands down a must-see! Just kidding. It's pretty much the opposite, so I strongly advise you to steer clear!

Yet still the film thrills, chills, and brings justice and revenge style terror that any horror fan will cherish and consider a classic to watch over and over.First story is a good old western justice tale of revenge titled Old Chief WoodenHead which is set in a rural desert small Arizona town.

And yet the only hope that he puts in return and what he lives for is a stature of a wooden Indian outside his store. One day he receives a gift of worthy stone from an Indian man named Ben Whitemoon who says this is payback for his people's debts. Only the episode turns to a violent and tragic end with the store getting robbed and destroyed by modern day punks in search of money so they can flee to Los Angeles to start a new life. After the tragic end, it's payback time and justice Indian style with warpaint and all! Overall good segment that was well done and I love the justice and revenge it shows.Next tale is The Raft about a group of weed smoking and sex driven teens that being two males and two females who take a trip to a lake to do some supposed harmless swimming.

So while speeding back on the interstate when exited onto the I-395 Maine ramp she hits a hitchhiker. And it shocks her, now it's hit and run.

He hated it (I should add that, on another occasion, he took me to see 'Stealing Beauty'??? Hardly a guys flick!)and I was blown away. I remember being terrified during the second Bear attack; the one at night when Steve is killed. Absolutely horrific. I'd forgotten about this film till just recently when a colleague at work brought it up and we both agreed it was fantastic. So... I rented it just this week and have watched it a couple of times now. There's no doubt about it - a truly fantastic film. You have everything here - a great cast, a WONDERFUL score, beautiful locations and cinematography, an excellent script, and a genius two act plot. If I could fault anything, it would be that the Hopkins character is almost too pious and measured. But then I just think of his wife's line at the beginning Did I ever tell you that you're an angel? Everything but the wings! and it somehow all makes sense. Baldwin proves himself to be an excellent actor with a great range. He can be funny, infuriatingly arrogant, ignorant, scared, scary. You have to give him due credit. Hopkins is dignified, wise, selfless, a quiet leader. His character here says so much with so little at times. Being a New Zealander,I feel I should add that this film is almost a forgotten feat of N.Z cinema. In the store I went to, it wasn't even in the N.Z film section, it was in the 'Adventure' section. I guess, what with all the hooplah surrounding L.O.T.R and directors like Jane Campion et.al, Lee Tamahori has been somewhat forgotten for this - a timeless classic and a textbook example of a 'ripping yarn' as my ol' Dad used to say.What are we going to do, Charles?
