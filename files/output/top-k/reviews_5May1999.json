It is kinda dated - no blacks nor hispanics, and one can sit in a relatively safe Central Park - how did they film that breakfast in front of the Tiffany's window without getting mugged? hhmmm oh well. Everyone dresses like a mensch, so you can see this film pre-dates the Beatles. Audrey Hepburn, George Peppard, Mickey Rooney, Buddy Ebsen and Patricia Neal are perfect in their respective roles. Audrey Hepburn was a marvellous Holly Golightly; although perhaps Marilyn Monroe might have been excellent,  but we shall never know and who cares? George Peppard was perfect in his role of Paul Varjak. He never tries to overshadow Holly and yet he turns out to be quite a tower of strength for her at the end. Buddy Ebsen was great as the bewildered and good Dr. Golightly who is genuinely loved by Lulamae Barnes i.e. our Holly.But.....I adored Mickey Rooney's  Mr. Yunioshi, since I live in Japan and Mickey Rooney gives a slapstick rendition of all the stereotyped Japanese we admire. No one has such horrible buck teeth and I have yet to find a Japanese who talks like Mr. Yunioshi but hey it's funny!!! I kept laughing till my sides hurt at the opening scene when Yunioshi takes his own picture. No, Japanese men are not that myopic either,  really!!! The party at Holly's apartment is fabulous - the cheap tawdry phonies are all there and Martin Balsam.'s O.J. Berman starts off as a true slime ball but later on shows a genuine worth when Holly is in trouble with the law. There are no real boring moments except I felt uncomfortable with Patricia Neal's character - but that is because Neal is so good at it, that we do feel uncomfortable with her. A great film and the music is sooooo good.PS LOVED that cat!!!

There are moments of chilling visual symbolism. The climactic space battle is extremely well-choreographed, possibly one of the most well done special effects sequences in cinematic history. And George Lucas does well on finding a suitable climax for the series. There is a minority that says this was a cheap thing to throw in but I totally disagree. This scene is sad but ultimately touching, which I think will be made all the more so when the six stories are complete. The ending scene in the special edition is far more satisfying than it was originally.Which brings me to my complaints.Jedi is slow-moving, from the long, drawn-out scenes in Jabba's palace, to the Endor battle with the Ewoks, an act in the film that is so poorly marred by bad pace and editing that you have to wonder whether the editors were suffering from severe attention deficit disorder while they were doing it. And let's not forget those Ewoks. Don't get me wrong, they are cute. But what in God's name do these little furballs have to do with the Force and the Rebellion?And then of course we have the acting. The one guy who seems to be really trying here is Mark Hammil (for once), who was never a very capable actor anyway but he does have some moments in which he shines here. I think what he did best in this one was actually underacting the role rather than playing the same old farmboy whiner (A New Hope) or the hero who thinks he can do anything (Empire). Then there's Carrie Fisher. I actually thought she was decent in A New Hope, and she was occassionally quite beautiful in Empire. And she was attractive here as well, but man, that acting has got to go!!!I think this is the one film I did not really care for Harrison Ford, which is rather difficult because he is one of my top three favorite actors. Between the first two films we got the sense this character was changing, becoming a better man than the wisecrack we were used to. But in Jedi he's back to the same old wisecracks. In Empire he really started to look like he was caring for people, especially Luke- which is totally evident in the beginning of Empire. In Jedi he's already back to looking down on him. Above all Ford himself seems disengaged from the film, bored with the material- something he admits, and something I do not blame him for at all.Again, there are moments of greatness in Jedi. The score by John Williams is very good, some of the sets are impressive.These are the moments that illustrate to me the style that should have prevailed throughout the whole film.

This movie is less a story than a symbolic examination of the place of technology in our lives and our desensitization to even the most disturbing elements of our everyday lives. And as such it's smart, funny, entertaining, and engaging. I was totally blown away.This movie is a good double-feature with the Matrix, but it certainly goes a lot of areas The Matrix isn't prepared to go-- the only hint of this sort of thing in The Matrix is when the mirror crawls over Keanu's body until it slides down into his throat.It's also amazing that this film came out at the same time as the Littleton Massacre-- Cronenberg sees the place that violent and realistic video games play in real life violence. He also questions WHY reality isn't good enough for people, why they would want to live in a game. Cronenberg is SO far ahead of everyone in terms of thinking about these things.One of the most disturbing elements of the movie, which I think is an amplification of trends in our world, is the character's blase attitude toward the mutant amphibians that are everywhere through the film, and the LACK of concern or disgust toward machines made out of the body parts of these animals. I loved how mundane it was to stick an unbilical cord into your back. This was most disturbing to me during the scene when the two-headed lizard wanders out from behind the gas pump.One of the most brilliant aspects of this film is to set these fantastic creatures and events in settings that are NON-futuristic, ordinary, and dirty. Cronenberg, the man is a genius.I must also mention the INCREDIBLE opening credits sequence. It was just SO BEAUTIFUL. I have no idea what we were looking at (I was trying to figure it out), but whatever it is was so rich and gorgeous, it was really as if he was using the screen as a canvas. The score is also mournfully beautiful. I'm going to go buy it after work today.Don't believe anything negative you hear about the performances. They are, across the board, amazing. I think people don't understand that the movie KNOWS that these people are speaking dialogue-- we're not supposed to believe that these are real characters speaking real lines. Both leads are incredible-- Cronenberg was so smart to spot Jude Law's intensity in his other, smaller roles. The real challenge of these performances is for the actors to express emotions and states of mind that are completely out of sync with what is happening, and they pull it off incredibly.Also, I MUST say that Cronenberg is the ONLY director I know of who is really delving in a very deep way into homosexual themes (no, I am not saying he is gay, and I don't think that's the main focus of his films). Without being graphic, each of his films since Naked Lunch has explored the issues of being bodily penetrated, absorbing bodily fluids, the meshing of two bodies, etc., in a way that INCLUDES homosexual themes in a way other films shy away from. The bioport looks rather like, and is located rather close to, another hole on Jude Law's body, and you just can't deny that SOMETHING is going on when Jennifer smears vaseline all over it and then shoves her finger inside! I was lucky enough to see this film with a great audience, and there were several snickers when Jude Law say he doesn't like being penetrated. (This is also the only audience that snickers wickedly after the Partnership for a Drug-Free America PSA that preceded the film!).Cronenberg has always been interesting, but I've become acutely focused on him since he's headed into more artful films. This is the most focused and tightly themed film of his that I have ever seen. I think it's his very best, and I'm sad that there isn't more of a literate audience for him. He is one of those filmmaker's whom one is simply thankful for.

I also like horror movies that do not take themselves too seriously.  I hated The Exorcist, but I loved Halloween and Friday the 13th.  So, this movie is right up my alley, not your typical movie.  I had somewhat high expectations, lowered only by the fact that it is a rip-off of the best comedy, and horror flick ever, Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn.  I enjoyed myself.  This movie is a good waste of time for those who have nothing much better to do, although see it with friends.Acting Devon Sawa cannot act interesting for two seconds.  Out of everybody in the whole movie, I hated him the most, and he was the lead!! I loved his friends, on the other hand.  I also liked Vivica A. Fox in this role, simply because it was forced, contrived, fake, and insanely bad.  I could not have seen a better person in that bad of a character in this type of movie.  The only reason to see this movie is Seth green and the other guy, who are cool.  Green takes laziness to a humorous level, and makes decent comments.  He is actually really funny in this role.  The chubby one makes a party animal look like someone obnoxiously fun.  No oscars for either of them, the role is not that hard, but it looked like fun anyways. The reason I hated Sawa so much is he was boring, and unmotivated.

Emily Watson her steady-delivery self as Marion the wife.Films with stories about the woman\/wife straying\/taking a diverted course from married life we have Francis Ford Coppola's 1969 The Rain People with Shirley Knight and James Caan; Benoit Jacquot's 1997 Seventh Heaven (French Le Septieme ciel) with casually cool Sandrine Kiberlain as the young married woman, Vincent Lindon as the doctor husband, and Francois Berleand as the mysterious doctor who talked of Fung Shui with Mathilde (Kiberlain's central character), performed hypnosis and cured her of her sexual deterrence; Tony Goldwyn's 1999 A Walk on the Moon with Diane Lane as the mature-naïve mix of a restrained  housewife, Liev Schreiber as the hardworking husband, and Viggo Mortensen as the arousing outsider.Here's a different angle from the perspective of the man\/husband having diverting thoughts from his marriage. A settled family life seemingly perfect and fine, along comes the diversion his best friend (male) from 10 years ago, bringing back memories of those carefree artist life of the '60's and being in Paris. Story setting began in England's Eastwood 1977, where husbands go to work in the city by train and return home in the evenings to their wife and family in stable quiet suburbia Metroland. Flashbacks of '60's scene in Paris gave us clues to how it was and has been for Chris (Bale's character). We also get to know Marion (Watson's character, Chris' wife) in and out of flashbacks and also in Chris' daydreams.The film raises questions on marriage. Watson's character Marion pointed out that marriage and relationship are not two separate things. Here, in this movie, the women (both Marion and Annick) do seem to be more mature in their views of relationship while the young men seem to be still in want of learning and growth in that department of life.As the film's tagline goes Metroland is a state of mind -- it doesn't matter where you go. It's really up to you how you see yourself and adapt yourself to the environment you're in. Occasional dissatisfaction prompts one to do re-thinking and it is a means to improvement and changes in life.I've noticed Christian Bale's performance in Gillian Armstrong's 1994 Little Women with Winona Ryder and co. He did a terrific job in Todd Haynes' 1998 Velvet Goldmine -- he's actually the central character of that story even though he's billed after Ewan McGregor and Jonathan Rhys-Myers. Here he is in the leading role and deserves his top billing recognition. Look forward to seeing him in the upcoming A Midsummer Night's Dream and American Psycho. Emily Watson delivered an equally matching performance and complemented Christian's character well.Probably more appreciated by audiences in the Baby Boomer age, who's been through the '60's and '70's and understand what identity crisis and chasing after one's dream could be like. It's a mature topic.For marriage\/sexual problems, a more in depth conscientious treatment of the sexual revelations approach can be found in 1996 Bliss with Sheryl Lee and Craig Sheffer, and Terence Stamp in the sexual therapist role (NFE explicit scenes and story content for mature audiences only; film provides probing questions to one's way of loving and what loving is). A slightly lighter approach is Benoit Jacquot's 1997 Seventh Heaven (French), while a tense emotional approach is Christian Vincent's 1994 La Separation (French) with Isabelle Huppert and Daniel Auteuil, a wonderful pair to watch in spite of the hard medicine.

His mother, a rough woman, close to nature and keeping her son away from the Real World, kept reminding me of the movie Boxing Helena; Waterboy Sandler and his mother (played by Kathy Bates) truly have their first Oscar-winning performance here. Not only do they appeal to the audience by their vivid acting and obvious involvement in their parts, they also carry the characters to such heights as has never been done before in a genre like this. I even dare say Shakespeare is eating his heart out.Please go and see The Waterboy; you will be able to tell your children in fifty years You Were There when The Waterboy came out, and you will say it with pride. Thank you, Sandler, for taking your audience serious and showing us the hard life of the underpriviliged in our society.

The F\/X are awesome and Freddy is at his wisecracking best. Although this movie takes a different direction than the previous ones i like its slightly less darker attitude and the fact that it's based at the high school, and doesn't have too much time devoted to the parents (as was did in no. 1) The return of Joey and Kincaid  was a treat although they followed in traditional horror movie tradition by dying in the first five minutes.

A lot of people would say that THE EXORCIST is, but I gotta stick with THE SHINING, no contest.But like THE EXORCIST, it creates the perfect atmosphere for a horror film. Fans of Stephen King have serious problems with this film, but they need to get over themselves. THE SHINING is Kubrick's movie and I don't think there is a single director who could've made it better. I've seen King's version on television and laughed through the whole thing, that's how inferior it was.A lot of people also had a problem with the slow pace & Mr. Nicholson's acting. Stanley Kubrick's technique of slow, drawn-out pace is absolutely necessary in a film like this as it was in BARRY LYNDON. It's used to absorb the viewer totally into the film and it's story. As for Mr. Nicholson's acting, how do you expect a man being confined in a large haunted hotel to behave? I think he did a great job, but the real praise I think belongs to little Danny.THE SHINING is a horror masterpiece, which is why I think, Kubrick didn't make any others; how would you top this? The story centers around a family struggling as caretakers of a huge haunted hotel. Although some people believe that THE SHINING is about the haunted hotel, I honestly focused more on the extreme cabin fever.
