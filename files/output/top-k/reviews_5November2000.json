As a matter of fact, I think if Snow Day had been made more for adults with Chase in the lead it might have been a much better movie. Chase does get a few laughs here, but he's not on screen as much as you would like him to be and in the process he's wasted. That stinks.

My favorite movies happen to be time piece dramas.....it's not like I am an action genre fan. However, this movie is completely limited because of the script and the story line in genearl. It wouldn't matter who played the roles and who directed, the movie would have fallen flat. The biggest problem is that the movie focuses far too much on the overall theme......they try to smack you upside the head with the theme time and time again.....it is forced, and the theme is pretty generic......Worse yet, and most importqantly, the characters have no dperth to them......they are boring and you never quite fully understand where they were in the past to care about them in the present. They try to elude what these characters were like before we get to the present, but they do it in such a shallow fashion, that we never really know any of the characters, nor do we dare about them. Bagger Vacne(Will Smith) is a forced, generic, unnecessary character, just their to swarm us with his annoying logic on life...and we never know where he got this logic from....he is just a mystical chracter who we are not allowed to know anything about. Runnolph Junah(Damon) is scared from his past, and we know so little about that past when he was in war...We know he returns home a different guy then when he left and that he has lost his swing(he was an up and coming golfer legend before he went to war). Now he is home, a drunk, and trying to drink away the memories....He makes the transition from drunk to golfer again literally in the snap of a finger......it is VERY unrealistic. And Charlize Theorn's character, no matter how hot she is, is a waste as well....We never feel like we know enough about her and Damon's past relationship to care what happens with it now...Their romance could be the weakest, unbelievable portion of the filme. There is never a level of excitment or conflict that can make this movie anything but drab. A River Runs Through It is one of my all time favorite movies. In that film, a more boring topic than gold was chosen...that of fly fishing, but you cared about the characters...you felt like you knew them, and because of that, yoiu were drawn to the entire movie....The Legend of bagger Vance comes no where near achieving this.

I still have yet to see a movie that will actually scare the wits out of me).Nothing prepared me for Alien.  I already knew exactly what was going to happen, and I still found myself in the dilemma of who would live and who would die.  The suspense was incredible, almost unbearable--at the end of the movie, I felt like I was gonna hurl!  Not because of the gore (I've actually got a pretty strong stomach for that), but because of my connection to the characters trapped aboard the monstrous Nostromo.  The feeling of hopelessness, despair, stranded in the middle of nowhere and awaiting the inevitable was so effective, I almost couldn't take it.  The claustrophobic sets (especially the scene with Dallas chasing the alien through the ventilation shafts) and the grisly alien effects, combined with surprisingly good acting from the cast, made this the beginning of a new era in science fiction.  Director Ridley Scott took us where no one had gone before--into the lives of the characters fighting the trauma.Before anyone died, we got to know each member of the crew.  By the time the baby alien violently burst from John Hurt's chest (and what an amazing scene!  Oh, but don't watch Spaceballs before watching this...it'll make it seem silly), we actually felt like one of the members standing around him, trying to hold him down, trying to save him but without any luck.  We had gotten a taste of everyone aboard, and every time someone died, we could really feel for them, a feeling of It's not fair!The slick camera angles were another fairly influential part of the film, somewhat shaky at times but it all adds for effect, especially near the end with Ripley frantically tearing down the tight corridors, steam spewing from all around, blinding her from what's ahead and what's behind.  If only I had seen it in theatres...that would have made it truly haunting.And a clever trick from Scott...the use of our own imaginations to decide what really happens to each character.  The only person we actually see dying was Kane and the chest-bursting incident, but we only get a glimpse of what happens to everyone else.  We see a bloody Parker, hunched over lifeless later on in the movie,  but we have no clue what happened to him. We saw the alien whip around, grab him and begin a short struggle, with blood pouring from Parker's mouth when all of a sudden, the alien's second mouth shoots out and--where does it go?  Who knows...this isn't even answered in the sequel.  All we know is that it tears into some part of the body and kills them almost instantly.  Personally, I think it grabs the heart (or some other major organ) and rips it out, but that's just me.Ridley Scott must be among the most talented directors in history.  I can't see a resemblance in his directing between Gladiator and Alien (or Thelma and Louise for that matter) besides stunning sets and stomach-churning gore.  He proves here that he can master the art of film as well as Hitchcock and Kubrick (actually, he combines both their talents in this film).

The claustrophobic sets (especially the scene with Dallas chasing the alien through the ventilation shafts) and the grisly alien effects, combined with surprisingly good acting from the cast, made this the beginning of a new era in science fiction.  Director Ridley Scott took us where no one had gone before--into the lives of the characters fighting the trauma.Before anyone died, we got to know each member of the crew.  By the time the baby alien violently burst from John Hurt's chest (and what an amazing scene!  Oh, but don't watch Spaceballs before watching this...it'll make it seem silly), we actually felt like one of the members standing around him, trying to hold him down, trying to save him but without any luck.  We had gotten a taste of everyone aboard, and every time someone died, we could really feel for them, a feeling of It's not fair!The slick camera angles were another fairly influential part of the film, somewhat shaky at times but it all adds for effect, especially near the end with Ripley frantically tearing down the tight corridors, steam spewing from all around, blinding her from what's ahead and what's behind.  If only I had seen it in theatres...that would have made it truly haunting.And a clever trick from Scott...the use of our own imaginations to decide what really happens to each character.  The only person we actually see dying was Kane and the chest-bursting incident, but we only get a glimpse of what happens to everyone else.  We see a bloody Parker, hunched over lifeless later on in the movie,  but we have no clue what happened to him. We saw the alien whip around, grab him and begin a short struggle, with blood pouring from Parker's mouth when all of a sudden, the alien's second mouth shoots out and--where does it go?  Who knows...this isn't even answered in the sequel.  All we know is that it tears into some part of the body and kills them almost instantly.  Personally, I think it grabs the heart (or some other major organ) and rips it out, but that's just me.Ridley Scott must be among the most talented directors in history.  I can't see a resemblance in his directing between Gladiator and Alien (or Thelma and Louise for that matter) besides stunning sets and stomach-churning gore.  He proves here that he can master the art of film as well as Hitchcock and Kubrick (actually, he combines both their talents in this film).  Alien will always remain one of the most inventive and influential additions to cinematic history.

I found the end chase scene to be kinda contrieved with Ripley going back to get the damn cat...but oh well...the first hour built up the characters and the tension until the Alien literally burst from Kain's chest and slithered into the dark. Then the Alien would systematically hunt down the crew until one was left...like a slasher film, only better. The ending, while flawed, was very tense with the death almost lurking around every corner until the final confrontation. It essentially uses the first hour to establish the characters, the story, and mood...the second hour is when all hell breaks loose. Slow by today's standards, but it works well.Direction Ridley Scott truly turned what could've been a bad move into a piece of absolute art...well except for Ripley going back to get that damn cat! But seriously, the atmosphere is what makes this movie as well as the direction. We never fully see the Alien, which stops it from becoming another cheese-fest with a guy in a suit popping out..Scott truly made one of the most tense movies ever,simply due to the atmosphere, the setting, and some slow direction....speaking of which...Setting The idea of chains hanging from everywhere around would make it into all the following Alien films and it works quite well here. The fact that the Alien blends into the dark side parts of the ship make it all the better. Characters Well acted and diverse characters all around and an Alien beast. Nuff said.My last thoughts I think the best movies are the ones with lots of emotion. In this movie, the emotions happen to be absolute fear and paranoia. The next two sequels were movies I enjoyed a bit more than the original, but all the Alien movies were different because they were made by four different film makers with four different styles and four different stories to tell. Other franchises should take a hint from the Alien series...3 out of 4 were excellent films with Resurrection being weak compared to the others...All in all, if you have two hours to blow and you want to see a good movie that keeps your eyes glued to the scene and doesn't have a loud explosion every two minutes or doesn't have an sensitive back story, this is for you. A must see. ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"5 November 2000","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  I don't think I've ever seen a worse movie than this.

It is rated #33 by the American Film Institute on their top 100 of the 20th century.  It was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four, including best actor for Gary Cooper, best song and best editing.  But, was it really that good?  After all, it was a bare bones black and white Western in an age of Technicolor spectaculars.It was that good and more.  `High Noon' was not really a Western as the genre had been defined to that point.  It was more of a character study of the human condition.  It just happened to be set in the American West.  Westerns at that time were action films with white hats and black hats.  There were fistfights and gunfights throughout the entire film.  They clearly differentiated good guys, on the side of justice and righteousness, from bad guys who spurned laws and sneered at those who obeyed them.  The heroes were always noble and fearless, typified by actors like John Wayne and Roy Rogers.  Moreover, the good guys always stuck together, despite all odds, to prevail against the outlaws.`High Noon' was the complete antithesis of this formula.  Kane is a flawed hero who is proud to a fault.  Although it is clear who the villain is, we never see him until the last ten minutes of the film.  The story is not about good and evil in the larger sense.  Instead, it is about conviction and integrity on a personal level.  Kane is portrayed as stubbornly putting his own feelings above the safety of the town.  He stands against everyone, willing to sacrifice his marriage, his friendships, his good name and his life for his honor and self-respect.  The biggest departure from the formula was his unabashed manifestations of fear.  This was unheard of for a Western hero.Controversy swirled around this film, released in 1952 amid the Red Scare and the McCarthy Era.  The fearful and selfish townspeople who turned their backs on Kane were seen to be allegorical of the movie industry that abandoned those who were blacklisted as communists.  Many in the industry saw it as smug slap in the face.  John Wayne called the film `un-American', preferring to think that Americans would always stick together to fight injustice, ignoring the reality of numerous branded actors who couldn't get work.  Stanley Kramer, in an interview forty years later, continued to deny that there was any hidden agenda.  He said it was a film about human nature, and the coincidental fact that there was such a striking parallel was just an indication that human nature doesn't change.The vanguard direction by Fred Zinnemann was nothing short of brilliant.  Zinnemann eschewed the Western formula and struck out in a completely different direction.  He chose black and white to give it a stark look.  The sky was overcast rather than sunny and blue.  The entire film was shot for only $700,000 (an extremely small sum even for 1952) almost completely on a studio lot.  This was the first Western, (and possibly the first film) to tell a story in real time (the story transpires in roughly the same amount of time as the length of the film).  The villainous Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) was known only through dialogue and he did not actually appear until the end of the film.  Zinnemann hung the pall of Miller ominously in the air like an evil spirit who was feared but unseen.  This made the villain bigger than life and added to the suspense.  Even when Miller finally arrived on the noon train, Zinnemann didn't let us see his face for a full two or three minutes, showing him strapping on his guns from behind and talking to his gang.  Finally, there was no action until the very end of the film.He uses two very effective techniques to build suspense.  The first is the use of clocks.  In the beginning of the film, they were small clocks in the background that had short pendulums that swung quickly.  As we got closer to noon, the clocks got bigger and the pendulums swing more slowly making them more menacing.  At noon, the clock took up the entire screen as we waited for the last tick and the train's whistle.The second technique was the repeated use of a static vista looking down the railroad tracks from ground level with no train.  This was a constant reminder that Frank was coming.  This created an extraordinary amount of tension.  Tinnemann's use of reaction shots and the editing by Harry Gerstad and Elmo Williams (who won an Oscar) were also brilliantly done.The use of music was also innovative.  Rather than a full orchestra pumping out heart pounding adventure music, we had a simple ballad featuring a harmonica and the voice of country great Tex Ritter.  This haunting tune emphasized the loneliness of Kane's situation.  The acting was marvelous.  Gary Cooper is masterful as the tormented Marshall who stands against the entire town and his own fear to face down the Miller gang.  This film launched Grace Kelly's career.  She was not only shockingly beautiful but gave a fantastic performance as Kane's wife, who all but abandons him.  Lloyd Bridges also shines as the hotheaded deputy.  Other notables included Lon Chaney, Harry Morgan, Katy Jurado and Lee Van Cleef.This film redefined an entire genre.  It has been called the quintessential Western, but that is too narrow in its praise.  It is quintessential filmmaking, a perfect 10.  It is required viewing for film buffs who appreciate the creative aspect of the art.  Besides that, it's great entertainment.

I can only compare it to THE HAUNTING in terms of power and intelligence.Based on the Henry James novel The Turn of the Screw. Ms. Giddens (Deborah Kerr) is the new governess of two orphan children, Miles (Martin Stephens) and Flora (Pamela Franklin), after their rich uncle wants nothing to do with them. Living in the uncle's country mansion alone with the children and the housekeeper, Mrs. Grose, Miss Giddens begins seeing the specters of the dead valet, Quint, and his lover, the dead former governess Miss Jessel. Giddens discovers that the specters are continuing their love affair through the bodies of the children and fights to save them from ultimate destruction.     Deborah Kerr is great as Miss Giddens, but I was much more impressed with the child actors, Martin Stephens (VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED) and Pamela Franklin (LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE). They are both magnificent in their portrayals of the innocent pawns in the games of the dead lovers, who are also revealed to have made love in front of the children. The themes of incest and pedophilia (is that a word?) are underplayed, but are quite obvious when the facts are laid out. It's too bad that the careers of both Stephens and Franklin were cut short, but both appeared in a few films in their adult years Stephens was in Hammer's THE WITCHES and Franklin almost stole THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE from veteran actor Roddy McDowall.Many of the scares are implied, but the images of the ghosts appearing to Miss Giddens are still chilling today. I could never accuse this movie of being slow. Every scene without the children is well-crafted and attention-grabbing; every scene with the children is a bonafide winner.THE INNOCENTS deserves to be on DVD, but isn't. I hope FOX wakes up one day and realizes they are sitting on one gem of a movie and finally releases it for a whole new generation to enjoy. I would even recommend it for family viewing on Halloween night; kids won't be bored by it. It is still effective after all these years, quite an accomplishment for a film of this type. Seek it out, it's worth it.

I can only compare it to THE HAUNTING in terms of power and intelligence.Based on the Henry James novel The Turn of the Screw. Ms. Giddens (Deborah Kerr) is the new governess of two orphan children, Miles (Martin Stephens) and Flora (Pamela Franklin), after their rich uncle wants nothing to do with them. Living in the uncle's country mansion alone with the children and the housekeeper, Mrs. Grose, Miss Giddens begins seeing the specters of the dead valet, Quint, and his lover, the dead former governess Miss Jessel. Giddens discovers that the specters are continuing their love affair through the bodies of the children and fights to save them from ultimate destruction.     Deborah Kerr is great as Miss Giddens, but I was much more impressed with the child actors, Martin Stephens (VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED) and Pamela Franklin (LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE). They are both magnificent in their portrayals of the innocent pawns in the games of the dead lovers, who are also revealed to have made love in front of the children. The themes of incest and pedophilia (is that a word?) are underplayed, but are quite obvious when the facts are laid out. It's too bad that the careers of both Stephens and Franklin were cut short, but both appeared in a few films in their adult years Stephens was in Hammer's THE WITCHES and Franklin almost stole THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE from veteran actor Roddy McDowall.Many of the scares are implied, but the images of the ghosts appearing to Miss Giddens are still chilling today. I could never accuse this movie of being slow.
