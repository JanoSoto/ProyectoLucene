This is one of those films considered to be not only the first signs of what Hitchcock would do in his later life, but also a film that is considered one of the very best British cinema has to offer. I though have to disagree, now don't get me by any stretch wrong here, I like this movie and I thought it was a good watch, but I just couldn't look at this and say it was great let alone really liking it.The story is exciting to be fair, man on the run, secret agents, a man who can memorise anything he see's or hears, it is absolutely crazy, but good. The plot plays our rather nicely, the timing is crazily off mostly because of its short running time and bits can seem rushed but all in all it is fairly exciting. I think it feels different than from other films of the day, it just seems much more like what you might see in films today, whether or not this has stood the test of time well that is for you to see, but it still feels refreshing-ish amongst the classic films.Robert Donat is our main man, trying to find out what these 39 steps are all about and also getting into a few pickles along the way. Donat is fine in the role and is really good here, not only is he calm and sophisticated but he also deals with the more serious moments well, and still in them can seem oddly charming. Madeleine Carroll is alright as Pamela but I did feel no one in the cast can quite match Donat and his performance. The characters are very complex I will say, Hitchcock makes sure he is not letting us the viewer know what the hell is going on until the every end, a good bit of suspense.And to the legend himself, Alfred Hitchcock whose skill is plain to see but also in my opinion overrated here. Now alright alright I'm not saying he's bad here, far from it but what I think is that people who watch this and see Hitch directed it instantly just say he directed it amazingly and he makes it good. Now although I don't fully disagree, I think it is actually those like Robert Donat who make this enjoyable and the whole thrilling plot is based on a book, Hitch does do a fine job, just not as good as he would do one day.If your looking at this film as either a Hitchcock fan or want to see his movies, I wouldn't say don't watch but don't also think this will be a masterpiece, it isn't all perfect. It is the length that didn't work for me and I even love short movies but it just feels too rushed like I previously said and you can't fully engage into the characters and their lives, we just don't get to know them well enough. I hear a lot of people compare this to the future Hitchcock film North by Northwest and that is true it is the man on the run kind of film, but what I will say is Hitchcock didn't copy this when he made that, this is very much his own style and one that is in line with British Cinema, not over in Hollywood.Overall I did (even if my review seems kind of oddly negative) enjoy this piece of cinema. I would recommend it to people mainly because I think some will really enjoy it, the excitement is there and the leading character is well acted out. I do however feel this is yet another old film overrated by us in the future, I mean not by a lot but just watch it properly and don't keep thinking about Hitchcock directing it.

I had heard it was a good movie and that Jeff Bridges' performance was somewhat memorable in contrast to his other work.What I got however, was a beautiful film about the understanding of our own inner fears, whether they are justified or not, and by extension, our established concepts of life and death.Although I'm not giving away direct spoilers, some of the analysis might prove to show minor aspects of the narrative.We start off moments after the tragic plane crash and we are soon shown that Max, our lead character, is not reacting to his near death experience the way we would normally expect. He seems calm and not very interested in giving interviews or even getting medical attention.As the narrative progresses, we notice how other survivors deal with their horrific experience and it becomes clearer that, when people endure through such an overwhelming experience, their own psychological reactions are not really alike. That is, people's own personal experiences and fears shape how their minds are going to process such an unusual and traumatic incident. This notion is very well constructed throughout the film due to some fantastic acting, specially on Rosie Perez's part, and great writing. Indeed, the supporting cast is very well written and the characters around Max are three dimensional and pose interesting ideas all trough the film.Even still, what makes this film great and unforgettable is the constant existential debate of what it truly means to be living, backed by, in my opinion, Jeff Bridges's greatest performance yet. After surviving the plane crash, Max loses the sense of fear as he comes to the conclusion that life and death are, ultimately, out of our control. With that said, is there necessity for rational fear or any instinct of preservation?The ending serves as an interpretation of the answer to this question. It only helps that the final crash scene is one of the most memorable and emotional scenes I have ever seen. We are shown how terrifying and destructive the sight of a disaster can be. The final scene works almost as a film in its own right by showing how people try to cope with the fact that death is imminent, and at the same time beautifully showing Max's transition into the mind state he was in through the entire film up until the end.It is hard to understand how such a film is not more broadly known and praised. Perhaps a more thorough study of the marketing process or the box office context could serve as an answer, but not an excuse. Jeff Bridges is sensational and delivers a dominant performance. He truly is one of the most underrated actors of his generation. After seeing this film, I doubt many would disagree with me.

But it is the movie that I deem to best represent the cinema and spirit of the decade. If you're wondering, that movie for the fifties is Rebel Without a Cause. For the sixties, it's Planet of the Apes. For the seventies, it's Apocalypse Now. For the nineties, it's the Truman Show. For the 2000s, it's The Dark Knight. For the 2010s, it's... I don't know. The Social Network? Anyways; let's dive in to this film, possibly my favorite true action-comedy of all time. If I want to be entertained for two hours, this is the film I'll pop in. There are two kinds of excellence in film; the kind that appeals to what 'normal people' want in movies and the kind that appeals to those who deal probably deal far too much in the esoteric. While I firmly belong in the second group, I am a film-goer, and as such, I do enjoy the first kind. And no film offers more of the first kind than this one.The comedy, the action, the tone, the stylings; they're all here. It does not try to be a big, emotional artsy movie. Instead, it just takes you for an enjoyable ride. The eighties did this kind of movie better than any decade. When you think of eighties movies, you likely think of these movies. This is the best one, but the likes of The Goonies, Ghostbusters, Gremlins, and likely any other movie in this decade with the involvement of Steven Spielberg comes to mind.Not to say that the eighties didn't try to make serious movies too. they just weren't very good at it. If you're interested, look up a list of Best Picture winners. Watching them is a bit weird; they have some eighties stylings but are dead grim and often depressing. It's like watching a film from a different dimension. Some were fine (Terms of Endearment) some were not as good (Out of Africa).I like the lot of them as a whole better than most. And the ones that people really like (Amadeus, Platoon, etc) that people love, I likely love more. But I will admit that they aren't exactly foremost on most people's eyes. There's a reason that there aren't talks to remake Driving Miss Daisy. And it's not because it's artistic blasphemy. They would remake The Godfather if they thought that it would make them money.Here's a novel idea how about I actually discuss Back to the Future? A high school kid named Marty McFly, down in the dumps from his high school life, where he is bullied by Biff Tannen and is under the control of the aptly named Principal Strickland (strangely, growing up, I had an insurance agent with that last name around by neighborhood. It was weird.) His home life isn't much better his dad is a wimp, his mom is prudish enough to make one shrivel up, and his siblings are layabouts. But his life changes once his friend Doc Brown makes a time machine (2015 here. still waiting for one). As he stole plutonium form Libyan militants, they chase and kill him. While escaping in a DeLorean, Marty transports them back to 1955.Thus begins the best use of nostalgia for the fifties in an eighties movie I've ever seen. Their cleverness in weaving in it is matched only by what they do with their setting. Where as a lesser movie would just throw up scenery and call it a day, this film uses every opportunity to use its setting for purposes both comedic and dramatic.Whereas films like Dirty Dancing couldn't even immerse their film completely in one decade (if you're gonna be a fifties movie, don't use an eighties soundtrack), this movie somehow manages to immerse you in two decades. Their version of the fifties is solid and fully fleshed out. It does not use pandering or too many rosey tones but still manages to capture the sensation of time traveling there.All this is only likely noticed on a third viewing. The first time, you are too immersed in the perfect blend of action and comedy, a trademark of Zemeckis at his best, from Forrest Gump to Who Framed (not Killed, no matter what my brain thinks) Roger Rabbit, as well as in the tight writing. The second time, you are two invested in the characters and one of the best and catchiest soundtracks of the decade. But if you watch this movie as much as I do, you notice that it is there.What else is there to say? there is a reason that I have such a personal attachment to this film. The only bad thing is that we don't have a time machine that would allow this film to be watched an infinite amount of times without any real time passing. But maybe someday.

Where as a lesser movie would just throw up scenery and call it a day, this film uses every opportunity to use its setting for purposes both comedic and dramatic.Whereas films like Dirty Dancing couldn't even immerse their film completely in one decade (if you're gonna be a fifties movie, don't use an eighties soundtrack), this movie somehow manages to immerse you in two decades. Their version of the fifties is solid and fully fleshed out. It does not use pandering or too many rosey tones but still manages to capture the sensation of time traveling there.All this is only likely noticed on a third viewing. The first time, you are too immersed in the perfect blend of action and comedy, a trademark of Zemeckis at his best, from Forrest Gump to Who Framed (not Killed, no matter what my brain thinks) Roger Rabbit, as well as in the tight writing. The second time, you are two invested in the characters and one of the best and catchiest soundtracks of the decade. But if you watch this movie as much as I do, you notice that it is there.What else is there to say? there is a reason that I have such a personal attachment to this film. The only bad thing is that we don't have a time machine that would allow this film to be watched an infinite amount of times without any real time passing. But maybe someday. After all, where we're going, we don't need roads. ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"31 August 2015","score":"","review":" No need to recap the plot. This artful fantasy amounts to one of Stewart's signature roles. And what an outstanding actor he is. Hard to believe the flinty-eyed hard case from Anthony Mann westerns could be so utterly engaging as he is here. His constant geniality comes across as so unforced, it transforms the darker undercurrent into a charming gem. Note, however, that Dowd's only a drinker by innuendo; at the same time, he's not really shown either drinking or being drunk. Of course, real inebriation would have put a different complexion on things. A fantasy character like the 6-foot rabbit invites some kind of speculation on what his presence in the film might mean. Here briefly is mine. I take Harvey to be the spectre of our better nature that we usually shove aside in favor of the hardening demands of the practical world. For example, curing Dowd of Harvey would make him more normal by everyday standards, which is the mission of the sanitarium. But Dowd's cooperative, friendly manner would be erased in the process. His mother almost realizes this too late. For practical purposes, we might not want everyone to see a Harvey as Dowd does. After all, how could the extremely altruistic Dowd or anyone hold down a hierarchical job in a competitive world. Yet Harvey may also point the way to a better world; that is, if we can bring the real world and our better nature into greater harmony. Maybe that's what Dr. Chumley experiences once he begins to see Harvey. After all, the 6-foot rabbit may be imposing, but being a rabbit, he's not threatening. As a result, he's always present but never coercive. Thus, in order to be seen, our better nature has to be embraced, even if it seems a delusion to the practical world. However, I assume drinking is not a part of that nature. But just how that fits into my little picture, I'm not sure. Perhaps you have a conjecture.Anyway, the movie can certainly be enjoyed apart from any conjectures. And thanks to a sterling central performance, an outstanding supporting cast, and smooth direction, it remains an amusing gem, without necessarily being food for thought.

After transferring his soul into the doll, Chucky (as he would later be addressed) gained quite a following for his disruptive antics and morbid enthusiasm. Upon his first appearance, Chucky had an imposing presence that made several viewers uncomfortable because of how creepy dolls are in general. However similar to other franchises, the scare factor and level of seriousness viewers began to accept was beginning to stretch too thin. By the time Child's Play 3 (1991) came out, fans and viewers a like became fed up with Chucky's goal of trying to transfer his soul into the body of Andy Barclay. For writer and creator Don Mancini, a small hiatus was in order after being pushed around to make sequel after sequel for his brainchild. A decade after the release of the original Child's Play (1988), Mancini returned and wrote for this feature that began Chucky's new trilogy.To some this was an improvement over Child's Play 3 (1991), while others were shocked the see the abrupt change. What Mancini had changed was the tone of the script. For the last three films Mancini wrote them as if they were literal; happening in the real world. The new intonation was that the story would be self aware in its execution but still continue from where the last film ended (roughly). An old lover of Charles named Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) acquires the shredded remains of Chucky (Brad Dourif) and resurrects him. After being brought back, Chucky decides in order to finally get out of his body, he needs the amulet he had from the time of Child's Play (1988) located in his casket where he was buried. Paralleling these events is troubled couple Jade (Katherine Heigl) and Jesse (Nick Stabile) who are constantly harassed by Jade's uncle Chief Warren Kincaid (John Ritter) for Jesse supposedly being a bad influence.As much as some viewers find the self-aware script jarringly different, having the series turn a comedic cheek to that of serious was a good move. Considering it became sillier as time went on, parodying it seems like an okay solution even with its flaws. For example the fact that it pays homage to its own films by clearly making a comment about it is funny for the fans to see. Even better, it references other horror icons directly and indirectly. It does bring up some clerical issues though. For example, other than Chucky how would another character know how Chucky killed people in the prior films? Also, is this now a universe where all the horror icons have been locked up or killed that their item that made them popular is now in storage? It doesn't make sense even if it is funny to see on screen. As for physical comedy, there are some ironic moments in the film involving Chucky's plastic body. Yet again, some bits are silly because of how physically impossible it works out.One other component to the writing that may make the plot feel predictable is because of how familiar viewers are with Chucky's nature. If you know how Chucky works, well then things may be more transparent than expected. The acting is adequate for what is asked though. Brad Dourif again succeeds at voicing his plastic counterpart with just the right amount of comedic and quotable lines. Jennifer Tilly as Tiffany matches Dourif's chemistry nicely by being just as foul-mouthed and violent. Nick Stabile and Katherine Heigl as the troubled couple feel authentic and end up demonstrating the power of teamwork later on. John Ritter as the annoying uncle plays his part like it should be too. There's even an appearance of Lawrence Dane from Darkman II The Return of Durant (1995) playing a detective. Since this is a comedy now, there is no scare factor unless the viewer doesn't like stitched up Chucky. The violence though is just as bloody as were compared to its other sequels. The kill scenes just keep getting more and more inventive by the jigsaw doll.The cinematography shot by Peter Pau was decent too. Pau as director of photography has had more experience in the action genre and his skills are highlighted when the few action scenes in this feature show up. For every other frame, the scenes are well lit and conceal the illusion of the living dolls. Also an important side note; as time has gone on, Kevin Yagher's production of puppet effects designers \/ puppeteer coordinators has really gotten the knack for lifelike movement. The original Chucky was pretty convincing but now it looks great and perfected. The film score by returning composer Graeme Revell was unique. For this entry, Revell creates a new theme for Chucky and keeps some old ones from his score of Child's Play 2 (1990). He also has a theme for Chucky and Tiffany, which consists of solo guitar and chanting girl choir. The rest of his score has a mix of the classic horror cues and action related arpeggios. The soundtrack containing songs sung by Rob Zombie and others is an okay addition but not necessary per say. It does make it feel quite 90s.It still has its problems of unexplained loopholes, ridiculous concepts involving physical comedy and continuity errors but it's a nice self- twist. The self-aware referencing script, the violence, the musical score and acting help make it watchable fluff.

He plays the con man Gregory Anton (his real name?) who somehow seduces singer Paula (Ingrid Bergman) and marries her. He suggests moving to London and to a particular house... a house where she found her Aunt, murdered. They didn't find who did it, but for the moment that doesn't matter that was in the past, right, and now they can make a new home for themselves in this house (with the upstairs of her aunt's relics boarded away. But about Boyer is this he at first seems so evil, so conniving, that I thought that from here on it would be a little hard to take him seriously as a real threat to the real hero of the film, Paula. But as the story goes on, and this gaslighting takes place - as this has been coined now due to this film - I bought into Boyer's performance more, as this man who can turn on and off the charm when he needs to, at a whim, and is rapidly making this woman go out of her mind.It's all about, of course, where one puts the blame for things. You lost this object? Oh, wait, did I? No, I had it a moment ago, it can't be, where was it? Oh, I'm sorry I lost it, I can't believe it. Oh, it's alright dear (and in reality the item is not lost, just 'put away' somewhere else). It's all about mind-games, but in a very particular, passive-aggressive manner. This is all about mental abuse - of course, if Gregory were to ever raise a hand to this woman, it'd all be over - so that he can go after his real prize, the jewels that he just knows are in her late aunt's possession in this locked room. At first though the audience doesn't (or may not) quite know what his game is at, despite getting a clue early on, when Paula is privy to a letter from her aunt that he quickly snatches away, and how he gazes lovingly (like in a brief trance) at some jewels in a museum.And yes, Joseph Cotten thankfully is here as the police inspector who sees something odd - that this Paula woman is the spitting image of her late aunt, who he knew as a younger man - and that they are back at THIS house. Oh, and that nobody comes out, sometimes driving the maids a bit harried themselves (including debut performer Angela Lansbury, wow is she young and good in this). But really, this is Ingrid Bergman's show all the way; she has to make Paula fragile and yet not someone who we should think is stupid or ignorant. Or, rather, the gaslighting - coined due to what Anton is doing to the gas from behind the houses to make it seem like things are going up and down - may make her feel like she doesn't have control. That's the key here who is in control of things, and how much will the control be twisted into something that is too painful to endure? Bergman has all of her capabilities as an actress at full tilt here; she embodies this woman's anxieties, but also how this man in her life can't ever make her fully happy. Actually, it's worse than that, as he dangles happiness and then takes it away in such a way as to make HER look bad. Watch the scene where the couple finally does go out - she insists to go to a music recital party to see an old mentor - and he does it again, acting like he's lost something, and it makes her break down in front of everyone. You can see in Bergman's performance, she really doesn't want to do this. But what expectations are there in this relationship? The man knows best, right? This man is trustworthy, correct?

He plays the con man Gregory Anton (his real name?) who somehow seduces singer Paula (Ingrid Bergman) and marries her. He suggests moving to London and to a particular house... a house where she found her Aunt, murdered. They didn't find who did it, but for the moment that doesn't matter that was in the past, right, and now they can make a new home for themselves in this house (with the upstairs of her aunt's relics boarded away. But about Boyer is this he at first seems so evil, so conniving, that I thought that from here on it would be a little hard to take him seriously as a real threat to the real hero of the film, Paula. But as the story goes on, and this gaslighting takes place - as this has been coined now due to this film - I bought into Boyer's performance more, as this man who can turn on and off the charm when he needs to, at a whim, and is rapidly making this woman go out of her mind.It's all about, of course, where one puts the blame for things. You lost this object? Oh, wait, did I? No, I had it a moment ago, it can't be, where was it? Oh, I'm sorry I lost it, I can't believe it. Oh, it's alright dear (and in reality the item is not lost, just 'put away' somewhere else). It's all about mind-games, but in a very particular, passive-aggressive manner. This is all about mental abuse - of course, if Gregory were to ever raise a hand to this woman, it'd all be over - so that he can go after his real prize, the jewels that he just knows are in her late aunt's possession in this locked room. At first though the audience doesn't (or may not) quite know what his game is at, despite getting a clue early on, when Paula is privy to a letter from her aunt that he quickly snatches away, and how he gazes lovingly (like in a brief trance) at some jewels in a museum.And yes, Joseph Cotten thankfully is here as the police inspector who sees something odd - that this Paula woman is the spitting image of her late aunt, who he knew as a younger man - and that they are back at THIS house. Oh, and that nobody comes out, sometimes driving the maids a bit harried themselves (including debut performer Angela Lansbury, wow is she young and good in this). But really, this is Ingrid Bergman's show all the way; she has to make Paula fragile and yet not someone who we should think is stupid or ignorant. Or, rather, the gaslighting - coined due to what Anton is doing to the gas from behind the houses to make it seem like things are going up and down - may make her feel like she doesn't have control. That's the key here who is in control of things, and how much will the control be twisted into something that is too painful to endure? Bergman has all of her capabilities as an actress at full tilt here; she embodies this woman's anxieties, but also how this man in her life can't ever make her fully happy. Actually, it's worse than that, as he dangles happiness and then takes it away in such a way as to make HER look bad. Watch the scene where the couple finally does go out - she insists to go to a music recital party to see an old mentor - and he does it again, acting like he's lost something, and it makes her break down in front of everyone.

That right there should give you an indication of the caliber The Highlander. Anyway, the story is that there exist Immortals who roam the Earth hunting each other. They can't be killed unless they are beheaded. At some arbitrary time in history (which turns out to be 1984), they will be drawn to a far off country to partake in what's called The Gathering where they will fight for The Prize which only one can have hence the famous line There can only be one.I found the bizarre transitions somewhat entertaining. That is, they are entertaining in the way a car crash is entertaining; it is more of a morbid curiosity than joy. A shot of the bottom of a lake in Scotland circa 1500, for example, wipes to the bottom of a fish tank. To signal a flashback to WWII the image on the screen shatters with the sound of cannon fire.In terms of acting, we have three main characters, The Highlander (Lambert), Sean Connery, and Victor Kruger (Brown). I've never been a big Christopher Lambert fan particularly because of his laugh. It makes me feel like kind of a bad person if I dislike the guy because of his laugh, but have you heard it?! It always sounds forced and what is more unfortunate is that he laughs at inappropriate times throughout the movie. It reminded me of Tommy Wassau's laughing in The Room.I included Sean Connery as a character instead of his ludicrous character name because he's just being Sean Connery in a fluffy red suit. I have a soft spot in my heart for Sean Connery so I'm down for his role as The Highlander's instructor. I never grew emotionally attached to his character, but I could say that about everything in this film.Victor Kruger is the Ultimate Warrior, according to Sean Connery. He is a Russian who has traveled across the world hunting Immortals. Clancy Brown's baritone voice fits the character of Kruger perfectly. I believe one of my favorite scenes in the movie is Kruger's modern day entrance. He is listening to the radio while driving in a 1975 Cadillac Coup DeVille. A reporter is commenting on a series of recent decapitations saying, Police currently have no suspects. I know who it is, Kruger bellows. He proceeds turn on a cassette of Queen's Gimme the Prize. If ever there was a scene in a movie that characterized the 80's. Now, even though he fits the role, there isn't much Brown can do to salvage the movie. His dialog, much like the rest of the dialog, is lacking.Now, I found Kruger and Connery entertaining but they aren't enough to save this movie. Cheesy special effects are all fine and dandy, in moderation, but there has to be something to balance it out; The Highlander's choreography is on par with some of Star Trek's fight scenes. The cinematography isn't very appealing either. Most of the odd camera angles seem unnecessary and, without any sort of justification, they are more distracting than anything.Overall, The Highlander is a very 80's fantasy action movie. Would I recommend it? No, not really. The cinematography is blah, as is the acting and dialog.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"31 August 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Director Bill Forsyth crosses the bridge between whimsy and despair in this spellbinding yet perplexing adaptation of a renowned Marilynne Robinson novel.Sisters Ruth (Sara Walker) and Lucille (Andrea Burchill) share a home in a forlorn Idaho railroad town, conflicting memories of their long-dead mother, and social isolation. Enter Aunt Sylvie (Christine Lahti), who comes to live with them. She is supposed to take care of them, but as Sylvie's many eccentricities pop up, like sleeping on a park bench and lighting candles with rolled-up newspaper, it seems the question is who will care for who. Will anyone?Mislabeled by its marketers as a comedy regarding a woman slightly distracted by the possibilities of life, Housekeeping seems more like a prison story, the prison being one's own family and\/or genetic destiny, of being born into a family of chronic outsiders and drifters fated to sad and lonely ends.Sylvie is carefree, yet detached both from her nieces and the rest of the world. Sylvie's behavior was annoying, Ruth tells us in a running narration. Then it became frightening. The different reactions of the sisters to their aunt become the lynchpin of the drama.While Lahti makes an impression and deserves the praise she got, the film's standout performances are those of Walker and Burchill, who inhabit their roles rather than just play them. To the extent Housekeeping develops your sympathy and engagement (for me the first hour does this quite handily) it's from watching these two interact and register as distinct personalities as the story goes on.Otherwise, the film is a bit of a slog, especially in the second half when it focuses on Sylvie and Ruth. Forsyth once said he was less attracted to making a movie than he was an advertisement for reading the Robinson novel.

We follow the eccentric, particular, and peculiar Victorian gentleman, Phileas Fogg. By particular, I mean, he orders that his breakfast be served at 837, not 836 or 838, and that his toast be precisely 87 degrees. As with most gentlemen around that time he has a valet to help him with his day to day tasks but because he is so difficult he's gone through half a dozen in five months. His latest valet is an earnest, Spanish acrobat named Passepartout. Now, the journey begins when Fogg bets his fellow Reform Club members that he can go around the world in 80 days. Hence the name. They visit places like Madrid, Pakistan, Thailand, Japan and it was filmed on location in many of these places.At 167 minutes, this is a long movie and it feels like it. When the group is in Madrid, Passepartout takes part in a really lengthy bull fight. Being from 1956, before I saw it I anticipated a musical. That would explain the length, I thought. That's one of those things about musicals around that time. There is always a song followed by an extended dancing sequence. Not that there is anything wrong with dancing but, you know, after a while, let's just keep the movie going. But Around the World in 80 days is not a musical. Instead of dancing sequences, they have parades which are used to showcase a given culture. This is something interesting about this movie too. It provides an opportunity for the 1950's audience to see cultures around the world. There are lots of very relaxing shots with the camera mounted on the front of a train as it passes through the landscape.Now, this is 1956 after all, and being 1956 you have the problematic racism and sexism that you'd expect. For example, when the group goes through the jungle somewhere in India, they come across a group of cannibals who are sacrificing an Indian Princess, played by the ever so Indian Shirley McClaine. When the groups goes through America, they encountered a group of the Sioux or as the movie calls them violent red skins. It was one of those movies that I just had to say it was a different time.Something that struck me as odd was the massive number of cameos. If you look at the wikipedia page for this movie there is a whole section devoted to just the cameos. Frank Sinatra for example is a piano player in a Wild West saloon. He's on screen for maybe a second and has no lines. He just turns around and smiles. I only recognized a couple of people but I'm sure it would be fun if I knew more of them.The acting overall is good. I liked David Niven as Fogg. He is persnickety but at the same time endearing. Passepartout is a really nice character too. He's like a Spanish acrobatic Charlie Chaplin. The whole tone of this movie is that of a lighthearted adventure.Would I recommend Around the World in 80 days? Because it is colorful and long, I can see it projected on a wall to be a backdrop for a party. I once went to a club where Rapmania the Roots of Rap was projected over the bar. Rapmania is a hip hop concert from the mid-nineties. While it was projected on the wall, current music was being played over the speakers. Nobody was really watching the movie unless they were using as a break from conversation or if they were sitting at the bar. It served as a sort of visual stimulation. On it's own though, because it is rather racist and sexist and very long, I wouldn't really recommend it.

David Mamet's compact and incisive script, adapted from his play, not only offers a fascinating and provocative dissertation on ethics, friendship, loyalty, and betrayal, but also paints a bleakly compelling portrait of two hopeless small-time losers who are fatally undermined by their own pathetic intrinsic fallibility. Franz and Hoffman act off each other exceptionally well while Sean Nelson more than holds his own as Don's eager young protégé Bobby, who isn't nearly as naive as he seems to be. Richard Crudo's sharp cinematography wrings plenty of claustrophobic tension from the cramped primary location. Kudos are also in order for Thomas Newman's spare bluesy score. Granted, there's virtually nothing in the way of action, but the poetically profane rat-a-tat-tat dialogue and spot-on stinging insights on the cruel manner too much talk can betray people by revealing their shortcomings more than compensates for this.
