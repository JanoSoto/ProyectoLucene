It starts off with about 15 minutes of fart jokes and standard stoner movie chaff. We are introduced to two worthless teenagers, sons of rich families, who basically do nothing but have sex, get high, and drive around. Then we meet the older woman whose husband cheats on her, who decides that sleeping with teenagers and then killing herself is the best solution. They drive and talk and have R-rated sex and that's about it.People often confuse commentary on nihilism with documentary of nihilism. This movie is the latter. There is no real commentary given. Some have praised the movie for showing the poor side of Mexico - but that's all it does. It shows it. Like it's a sideshow. It's an obvious attempt to lend the movie more credence than it has. Then it rolls on, and the fart jokes and adolescent sex continue.If you get great kicks out of seeing teenage boy ass, or from seeing two teenage boys make out with each other while an older woman pretends to give them oral sex, well, this is your movie. There's more nude adolescent in this film than five Joel Schumacher movies. And the sex is boooorrring. It's Skinemax standard - covered shots, rapid movement, concealing camera angles.And the most annoying bit about the movie is the ending. Suicide endings are cop-outs. They are blatant heartstring tuggers, used when the person writing the movie can't think of a logical character arc. It's weak and tiresome.If you want porn, rent a porn.

This movie was obviously never meant to win any Academy Awards (otherwise they wouldn't have cast Bruce Willis, at least at that stage in his career), but it does have some effective action sequences. The problem that I have with the movie is not that it fails as an action movie, but that it could have been so much better. The good action sequences are padded with at least as many awful ones, and there was plenty of thought put into about 5% of the story, while the rest is on auto-pilot.There is a great opening action scene where Arthur Jeffries (Bruce Willis) plays an undercover FBI agent acting as a robber in an effort to end a bank robbery safely, before the trigger-happy cops outside suddenly decide to open massive fire, completely unprovoked by anything except the passage of time. What follows is one of those endlessly satisfying scenes where the angry hero stomps out to the official in charge who's stupid decision resulted in the deaths of all those bank robbers, criminal or not, as he defies all ranking by smacking him in the face with his pistol, although I can't help wishing that he had done something even more. Unfortunately, this is one of the most satisfying scenes in the movie, which goes gradually downhill from here until the end.Miko Hughes, one of American's beloved child actors who can actually act, adds to his already extensive filmography with his portrayal of Simon Lynch, an autistic boy who loves puzzles a little too much. Autism is presented in a fairly straightforward manner, although the potential for massive intellectual processing is hugely enhanced and milked for all it's worth here. The problem with the movie is that it takes an enormously unlikely scenario related to autism and makes and entire film out of it.Simon has cracked a government super-code that was placed deep within a puzzle in a `geek's puzzle magazine' to test it's durability, and when he manages to decipher and call the secret phone number, all hell breaks loose. And by `all hell,' of course, I mean the rest of the goofy plot of the movie. The film starts off presenting an intelligent story about national security, until we realize that this is a code that they spent billions of dollars on without bothering to explain where those dollars went. This may be something that I just don't know, but what is it about a code that costs billions of dollars to make? Is it the two guys in the little computer room who charge too much for their services? Are the rates for Federal Hitmen getting out of control?This is where the movie really slips, by the way. Instead of simply admitting that there is obviously a problem with the code, which can be solved by a 9-year-old boy, autistic or not, and then setting about changing the code, the FBI agents involved literally turn into murderers, sending out a hit man, black gloves and all, to murder the boy and his parents, erasing him from existence and then hoping no one ever asks any questions.The action in Mercury Rising succeeds, for the most part (except for some awful blue-screen scenes, like the one between the trains), but it has enormous problems on a foundational level. Some stuff succeeds (I rather enjoyed the scene in the wine cellar, but even this is founded on a movie with an unstable premise.

However, director and cinematographer, Ron Fricke already covered that angle in 1983's Koyaaniqatsi. In that film Frick photographed Los Angeles, Manhattan and Las Vegas. Caucasian faces abound so I disagree with that argument. It's obvious that Fricke wanted to move on to other parts of the world. What a success it proved to be! Every aspect of this film is amazing.I first saw it in 1993 at the Laemmle Sunset 5 in West Hollywood. When viewed in its full 70mm glory with that thunderous score coursing through your body it's truly an amazing experience. *BLUSH* OK. I admit I was moved to tears at one point near the end. The images and music became so powerful. Those time-delayed tracking shots are amazing. I love the awesome photography of the inside of mosques, cathedrals and synagogues. Places and people that many of us will never see in our lifetimes have been lovingly captured by Ron Fricke. I watch this DVD at least once a month but it's not the same on the small screen. You should check local movie listings in your area because sometimes it'll pop-up at smaller, art-house type theatres.Here's something interesting Has anyone else noticed the similarities in some Madonna videos to Baraka and Koyaaniqatsi?

It's up to Poe to regain control, and make sure the bad guys don't escape... and he does just that... except for one man!!

You're less inclined to hit fast-forward in those lengthy scenes. This movie will resonate well with mature-age viewers because the story is not what you would expect from today's action packed cinema.  I appreciated the movie more as I got older.  Bob Wise explains on the DVD that production was extremely rushed and had no time to preview the film with an audience that would now after 20 years, tell him to tighten the opticals and emphasize characters.  This is precisely what he has done in the DVD version and its magnificent.Aesthetically, the DVD version shows you the best Star Trek The Motion Picture can possibly look.  Film is sharper; color is dead on however there is still a lot of film grain present unfortunately.  My guess is they cleaned the original negative up as much as they could but it had deteriorated so much in storage, or was badly preserved.  Certainly looks better than my bad pan\/scanned  VHS copy.The DVD truly shines with its brand new sound mix. This isn't your standard stereo to 5.1 DVD conversions like they are doing for movies pre 5.1; they have gutted it up and added new stuff.  The original release was so rushed that very little in terms of ambient sound and special effects audio elements were done on the sound mix amongst other production elements. For this DVD they went back to the original audiotapes and remixed them digitally.Goldsmith's score sounded fantastic when it originally came out now sounds even better on the DVD version.  It's tremendous, you will hear what your suppose to hear now with the added advantage of 5.1 surround sound. Goldsmith score truly has a chance to soar now by stretching into a clean high fidelity 5.1 environment rather than being squeezed onto a mono or stereo track.  Bass kicks in often especially on big musical cues.  You'll hear nifty panning and those surrounds and subwoofer will definitely get a workout.  In instances they isolate different parts of the orchestra through different speakers, mainly the bass and percussion.Most onstage dialog was re-recorded afterwards because of onstage noise due to mechanical devices etc; this is now common practice in the industry. The result is cleaner dialog that comes prominently out of your center speaker. The dialog audio is good, but on occasion it shows a mild muffled and tinny quality probably due to age of material or analog technology of the time, nevertheless I guarantee you, the average viewer will like it, I'm just being picky. In short the movie will sound almost as good as if the movie was made recently.Not only having rebuilt the original audio they have put in more surround elements, like ambient bridge noises and computer voices.  Not sure why they changed the `Intruder Alert' voice, I don't mind but I guess it was because they rushed the sound mix in the 70's and chose that voice as a last minute thing.  There are other elements that have been changed, for the better I would say.The DVD contents have been remastered with Wise's overseeing.  There are too many subtleties to comment on so shall briefly discuss a few.   Before opening credits you are treated to Goldsmiths V'ger\/Love theme, a nice touch.  Then you hear the bombastic Star Trek Theme. Newly done credits over moving starfield.First main new special effect is the Vulcan landscape, tilting from sky to the surface. Then cuts to a new matte painting of the beautiful orange sky. Originally Spock shields his eyes and in the reversal, not only is there no sun there is little sky visible.  The new matte painting now fits in nicely.San Francisco sequence has been redone, 3 new matte paintings that better show the futurized city, Golden Gate Bridge and a bigger shuttlebay.When they get into V'Ger they encounter a weapon heading towards them that is suppose to dissipate, in the original it simply disappears instantly, now we see a new visual that shows it dissipating just before it hits the ship.Later we see a probe heading towards the ship on the viewscreen and then through some hokey editing it appears on the bridge.  This has been replaced with an improved FX shot showing the approach of the entity on an exterior shot.A new 'Wing Walk' sequence.  Breathtaking new CGI's that show the away-team walk from the hull to the V'Ger stage, some using the original live action shots.  New FXs for the most part are based on original storyboards.  They didn't go overboard with the effects which is good, Bob tells us that they made FX that they could only do in the 1970's, unlike Star Wars whom George Lucas went overkill on new FX when he redid his in the 1990's.There are trims, some rearrangements of shots for the better.  E.g. Ilia\/Deckers exchange of looks, Kirk's `Oh My God', his second `Viewer Off.' I suspect they had to edit within Jerry's score, or have to also edit Jerry's score to accommodate the new editing, if so they have done it very well, I couldn't notice.  Some lengthy scenes remain in its entirety, e.g. flying up to the enterprise, I don't blame them for not trimming them, some are sentimental.The 2 DVD's come with a plethora of information. Audio commentaries by the director, 2 special effect's guys, an actor and the composer guide you through the director's edition.  Text commentary by Okuda gives even more scene specific info.  Disc 2 gives you most of the trims, deleted scenes from the TV and Theatrical release not used in the DVD version and an outtake of an abandoned visual effect.  Plus 3 documentaries about the abandoned TV series STPhase II, Directors edition DVD and the movie itself.  Plus advertisements\/trailers plus storyboards.A MUST BUY FOR FANS! You'll Love It!

Helena Bolham Carter is fine here, she acts like a suicidial, crazy person with good percsion. The real star here is Brad Pit whose performance in this movie is only equalled by his performance in 12 Monkeys. He adds such a great presence to Tyler Durden, its amazing. The only problem I had with this film is one Norton learns the deal with Tyler Durden, the movie loses its impact and becomes more of a hollywood type of movie. Concerning the rating, there are one or two heavy sex scenes, the occasional swearing, but I was surprised by the amount of violence. There isn't really that much, but when there is, it gets bloody. Really bloody. Unfortunately I knew the ending before hand, so not much of a surprise there. Fight Club combines ingenius storytelling to amazing visuals.

That's why, after seeing commercials and reading reviews for `The Man Who Wasn't There,' I expected a lot from the film. Unfortunately, it was very disappointing.Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is second-hand at a barbershop in 1949. He `doesn't talk much,' he says `I just cut the hair.' Well, that's true. Ed Crane barely talks at all. The only thing we hear from him throughout the film is his strangely soft and unmoving voice-over narrative recalling the accounts of the past few weeks of his quiet life.  The story begins when Crane suspects that his wife (Academy Award Winner Frances McDormand) is having an affair with the rich manager of a clothing store, named Big Dave (James Gandolfini). After Crane hears about a dry cleaning scam from a customer, he blackmails Big Dave for ten thousand dollars to invest in the dry cleaning business. Unfortunately, Big Dave soon finds out who the blackmailer is, and in a moment of self-defense, Crane kills Big Dave. Now, Crane's wife has been convicted of murder, and everything in his life goes downhill from there on&#133;`The Man Who Wasn't There' starts off very good. The beginning credits were more than reminiscent of the Humphrey Bogart era, and so was the calm voice-over by Thornton. I was instantly engaged in the story of this man living in a small town in California, and how his life could possibly get any worse. Well, after about an hour, the film had barely moved along at all. The pacing for this movie is very slow, and there are many films that could &#150; and should &#150; have been cut not only due to time, but because they paid nothing to the film's progress or character development in any way.Billy Bob Thornton is very good as Ed Crane, and uses the same quiet technique as he did with the character in `Sling Blade.' The movie is worth seeing just for his convincing performance.Frances McDormand is quite believable as his wife; the kind of small-town wife you always hear about. Bingo on Tuesday, alcohol throughout the week; she seems very depressed, and that is probably why she begins to have an affair with Big Dave. James Gandolfini would not be my first choice for the character of Big Dave, but he pulled it off quite nicely. The obese man proves he has more acting talent than just playing Tony Soprano (John Goodman would have made a nice choice for Big Dave, only because he is almost always in the Coen Brothers' films and it seems like they wrote the part for him. I'm surprised they didn't get him for the part &#150; maybe they tried and he refused?).Tony Shaloub (`Men In Black') plays the most enjoyable role of a big-town lawyer sent in to defend McDormand's character. He is wacky, enjoyable, and his crazy antics make the film. His are the only scenes I really laughed at. It seemed the most like a `Fargo Moment.' The Coen Brothers, creators of `Fargo' and the disappointing `O Brother, Where Art Thou,' wrote and directed this film (well, Joel directed, Ethan produced, they both wrote the script&#133;). I was in the minority about `O Brother, Where Art Thou.' I thought the film was boring, slow-paced and weird (what was the ending all about?). `Fargo' was excellent, mainly because it was demented humor and a great script, with some great actors. This film, however, seems to be boasting `original' all over. It seems the brothers are trying to stuff their recent films with odd bits and pieces to make them original. Well, I didn't find it original.In the end, `The Man Who Wasn't There' is not a winner.

Get a memory implant, of course! Using the latest technology, memories can be implanted in your brain in a matter of moments. You choose the destination, identity (spy, civilian, etc.) and Total Rekall (yes, Total Rekall) will install it for you.Warned by his friends not to get the implant, Quaid does so anyway. But something goes terribly wrong. Soon, his wife, friends and co-workers are all trying to kill him.but why? The answer may kill him.Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect for the role of Quaid. People can argue all they want about how bad an actor he is, but you can't say that after seeing this movie. He pulls the film's acting and stunts off with ease, all the while spitting out his catchy one-liners ('Consider this a divorce!').Sharon Stone is probably at her best here, seeing that her career went mainly down-the-drain from here on (okay, she won - or was nominated - for an Oscar for 'Casino.' This movie made her).Paul Verhoven directs this film, and there are no arguments that this is his finest work - by far. He was the director who went on to make such 'critically acclaimed' (*guffaw*) films such as 'Showgirls' and 'Hollow Man.' His only other film that was remotely good was 'Basic Instinct,' but this is still ten times better (Sharon Stone would not have starred in that film if not for 'Total Recall' - Verhoven said so himself.).The special effects in this movie are excellent; supposedly, they spent millions and millions on the fake Mars sets, and I bet they're glad it paid off.I recently bought the 'Total Recall' Limited Edition DVD with a newly remastered digital makeover, Dolby Digital 5.1, behind-the-scenes documentary(s), a commentary by Verhoven and Schwarzenegger, and much, much more. If you can find one now (it was limited edition so it might be off the market, now) I would recommend picking a copy up. It was fourteen dollars, and it definitely packed a punch for that much (no, I'm not a salesman!)'Total Recall' stands as Arnold's most 'thought-provoking' film and best conspiracy-type thriller. In fact, it is one of the best sci-fi\/futuristic thrillers ever.Many people do not realize that 'Minority Report' with Tom Cruise is actually a sequel to this film, and Verhoven and Schwarzenegger had talked about making it for a long time, but now, it looks like the deal is off. There is still a sequel in talks, however, not based on a story by Dick. Supposedly, the company (Miramax, was it?) wants Arnold, Stone and Verhoven back. Oh well. I, for one, am looking forward to it (though I don't understand how Stone is coming back.prequel?)Anyway, I'm getting off the subject. 'Total Recall' is a good movie, and a darn good one at that. It provides everything we want - and more - in a movie.4.5\/5 stars - maybe I'm overrating it. However, I feel it deserves that many stars.

He has a way of turning every movie he produces into s---, such as Black Hawk Down, although that was still good it could've been great if Ridley Scott was free to do as he pleased. Okay, now for this movie. The premise is somewhat interesting since it has never been tried before. The cast looks worthy, good actors such as Cage, Buscemi, and Malkovich. The execution is just plain bad. Instead of being a somewhat intelligent movie about its characters such as The Rock it becomes a mindless action film. It doesn't even have enough action to be called an action film. It tries to be dramatic and funny but utterly fails. Cage is all right here, he doesn't have much to act out. Buscemi is okay too, he doesn't do that much. Malkovich is too stereotypical, watch him in Being John Malkovich and In the Line of Fire. The ending was so pathetic with that song all of a sudden starting, it was such a sharp contrast to the overall feel of the film. That song even got nominated for an Academy Award (seriously, this is the first time it was played??) The wife and kid of Cage were really annoying, I wanted them to leave him alone. Overall, this is a stereotypical film with a weak plot and bad action. The only reason I give this above a one is because of a rare memorable action scene or a good joke. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 February 2003","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Jerry Bruckheimer.
