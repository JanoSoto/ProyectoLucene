The ship is going to sink. If filmmakers want to make a movie in which the audience already knows what is going to happen, they need to do a better job than to simply turn it into a sappy love story.

The acting is terrible, and the characters are very uninteresting.Reason 3 Time. This movie is more than three hours long! Is that really necessary? No it isn't. It is a three hours of my life that I could have used way more productively. It is a three hours of my life, gone forever! Wasted! And I can never get it back! I was thankful when DiCaprio died, because I knew the movie was almost over. I can't believe this movie got so much praise. Its right there in the same league as Pearl Harbor.

Not only is this an ingenious piece of comedy cinema, it also stars Hollywood babes such as Reese Witherspoon and Selma Blair, which I'm sure no one is complaining about. Reese Witherspoon always a treat to a persons eyes looks even more lovely and radiant than ever in this film, or to put it bluntly she looks damned fine throughout the film. With hilarious jokes and comedy pieces such as one occasion when Elle Woods, Reese Witherspoon's character, goes to a party but the bitchy Vivienne Kensington, played by Selma Blair, has told her its a costume party. Needless to say she turns up in a very comical outfit, the result unstoppable laughter.For a basic overview the film is about a blonde bimbo who gets dumped by her boyfriend, because he wants to marry a smart lawyer or other such girl, because thats what his upper class family of serious law types expect. The lovely and naive Elle Woods(Witherspoon) will not be left behind that easily however and decides to follow her boyfriend,leaving her sorority home filled with other bimbo types for the somewhat more serious Harvard Law School. With muchcramming, and the help of her two sexy best friends in her interview video she manages to get accepted into Harvard, proving from the onset that she's more than a pretty face.Once at Harvard, however she realises that though she came to Harvard for a man she has discovered a new passion, the law, and excels in her studies. Harvard is where she encounters other obstacles and hidden evils such as a corrupt college professor and Vivienne Kensington(Blair) and co who are less than amused by her cheerful naivety and surprising intelligence. Elle also finds good friends like Emmet Richmond played by Luke Wilson and Paulette Bonafonte played by the very funny and very sexy Jennifer Coolidge.However she manages to overcome these obstacles, and also finds that her knowledge of beauty and makeup etc is more than helpful in her college studies and in her court cases. Eventually she also realises that shes too good for the loser who dumped her, and finally lets go of her past and with it her ex boyfriend, instead she looks forward and fills the gap in her heart with a new handsome man. In the end she graduates from Harvard and starts the bright journey ahead of her. In short, it's a bit girlie, but also compulsory viewing and often quite serious and touching. You'll be laughing and crying alternately, but emerge with a warm happy feeling as you see Elle overcome hate and corruption to become truly, Legally Blonde.A great feel good, laugh out loud movie.

Working in a music\/video store, i often browse the stock for potential purchases and have often browsed straight past this hidden gem. Except maybe to stop and dream of skipping through a meadow with Miss Aniston. I'd never been interested for two reasons. 1. The cover doesn't exactly scream BUY ME I'M REALLY BLOODY BRILLIANT...PLEEEEAAASE!. And 2. Jen hasn't had a lot of luck in the movies, at least not in the height of Friendsmania. Picture Perfect bombed as did that other garbage she did with Cam Diaz, i forget the name. But after seeing this movie glaring at me from my TV guide last year - it was during her break up with Brad (THEDEVILHIMSELF) Pitt - and i thought..why not? She's needs the support of her fans right now and her performance in The Good Girl left me speechless. So here goes...Within 5 minutes i new i'd got this all wrong. Jen looks dowdy and well, normal, just like good girl (Having bad hair and wearing terrible clothes seems to somehow enhance her performances). You instantly believe the connection between Nina and her new gay best friend, George, played by the equally brilliant Paul Rudd. But before you know it the story has progressed so much that you're lagging some way behind. All of a sudden Nina's pregnant and wants to raise her child with George. But hold the phone! George is gay...and Nina has a boyfriend! Whats a boy to do? Simple, George watches a guy playing baseball with his son and get all broody. Hooray, Nina dumps the boyfriend and George buys a catchers glove. Everythings great and we're nearly done...but hang on a sec, i've only been watching this for an hour. It's OK, put the phone down, no need to complain. Their kissing - that looks fun - and she's undoing his pants and...the phone rings. Damn It! We suddenly find ourselves with two new characters and again we're confused. And so is George who finds himself having funny feelings for the young friend of a theatre critic played by the wonderful Nigel Hawthorne. Suddenly Nina's spending her nights alone while George has some bum fun. And there it is. An hour and a half later this movie is getting good, really good. You see Nina loves George but doesn't know that George now loves Paul (the friend), as does Rodney (the critic). It's becoming less confusing, a lot less. This all explodes after Thanks Giving dinner where Rodney lets slip about all of George's late night visits to his and Paul's place. The next 5-10 minutes are heartbreaking. Nina's world implodes as she realises for the first time what's going on and confronts George in the movies best scene. Sreaming and shouting ensues and we're finally left in no doubt that this gay\/straight relationship will never work out. She loves him, but he loves someone else, thats all it comes down to. This movie rules. I love it when you watch a movie thinking you know what its all about, but then it sneaks up behind you and screams BALLS in your ear. The ending however, is bizarre. I won't let to much slip but lets just say if you thought this movie was heading to a really depressing finalé...it doesn't. Really...really...strange. But it works! And that really sums up this movie, strange...but it works. Give it a chance, excellent performances throughout ensure you won't be disappointed.

This movie rules. I love it when you watch a movie thinking you know what its all about, but then it sneaks up behind you and screams BALLS in your ear. The ending however, is bizarre. I won't let to much slip but lets just say if you thought this movie was heading to a really depressing finalé...it doesn't. Really...really...strange. But it works! And that really sums up this movie, strange...but it works. Give it a chance, excellent performances throughout ensure you won't be disappointed. Special mention to the vastly underused Nigel Hawthorne and subtly hilarious Alison Janney.All in all, a treat. Head up young Person...

An amazing film for 1960, the story is the best horror of all time, the lonely hotel, the eerie house and the quiet mysterious deranged proprietor make the atmosphere sensational. Would have been very enjoyable to have seen this movie when it was first released as the story was unknown and to have the beautiful main character (Janet Leigh) killed so early and in the most vicious way in the shower was such an unexpected and shocking turn! The scene is one of the most famous in movie history but was not done by Tony as he was very squeamish and shy around woman! What began as a young woman running away with some money to better her and her boyfriends future turns into the murdering, deranged world of Norman Bates. You never know that Norman is the killer until the end, nor do you know he is mentally ill, but of course you always have this feeling! The film especially for its time is just so different, so wonderfully done and the story is made from amazing imagination.

This was Perkins role of a life time and he does it amazingly, he was born to play this part and will always be here with us as Norman as the film will always be in the memory as it is the best film ever made.It has also influenced every horror movie since and continues to be influential to this day.

When I heard John Woo was directing MI2, I thought - great, instead of a good spy\/action movie I will get a slow-mo fest with car wrecks and pigeons. Was I right? Unfortunately, one hundred percent.MI2 looks and feels like a 2-hour recording of a video game. Pretty people (people in question mainly being Cruise and his love interest) run, drive, shoot and generally do acrobatic things, almost half the time in slow motion. There is a generic action movie plot (villain steals thing X to do a dastardly thing Y and our hero has to stop him while THE CLOCK IS TICKING) right out of a B-action movie starring Steven Seagal or Michael Dudikoff, or an episode of Action Man cartoon series. No real team-based action, no spy angle, nothing. Just Cruise selling his hairspray commercial smile before doing some acrobatic stunt which should kill an average men ten times over.The flick really goes for the lowest possible denominator. No effort is spent into putting some logic or thought into the plot. The rubber mask shtick is so overused it is painful to watch. The action scenes never end, bullets, crashes and explosions are non-stop, yet the main characters never even get bruised.

Together they created a movie that is hardly worth seeing it for free, let alone paying for it.3\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"21 April 2006","score":"","review":" The first time i saw this film it was on the recommendation of my father and i'm so glad he did! i must have been about 14 and it instantly became my favourite movie and looking back now at 24 it still is for many reasons.

He couldn't be bought off. He didn't sell out. Woody Guthrie felt his music. It came from a sense of caring about people. As a film, Bound for Glory does a ten-star job of conveying the spirit of a man who could joke when the chips were down and who could sing out with an affection his listeners could believe. Guthrie made music move people to see themselves as worthwhile, as creators of vitality, gusto and dignity. And he did this during the Great Depression. People, especially people in the industrial world, feel less and less a sense of connectedness to each other. Community tends to lose quality as the rule of quantitative cheapness triumphs. The more the narrow, modern sort of individualism envelops them, the more humans slip into an alienation reinforced by commodified cocoons. Wage-slaves we are and wage-slaves we were in the 1930s. Only back then, we still had some remnant of solidarity, some spark of humanity to touch each other with. We still do, but it's fading fast. Woody's life was about fanning those embers into flames as people worked for wages, while others, the unemployed and under paid caught up in the depression of the Great Depression, wondered whether their families and other families like them would ever make it. Woody came from them and he sang for them. Woody was a working class hero, a modern day troubadour. He infused his listeners with his humorous, never give-up gumption, which, if you weren't lucky enough to know him personally, came out in waves as you drank in his warm words and tunes. Woody made them feel that maybe they could be bound for glory!If you find this movie on the rental shelf, pick it up and see it. It's great. I especially loved the scenes with Ozark Bule (played by Ronnie Cox). He must have been something.
