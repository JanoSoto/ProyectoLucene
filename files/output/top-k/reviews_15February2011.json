While the movie is scary at times, it is also insanely predictable and the characters are so stupid that it's astounding.The premise of this movie, while it seems somewhat like the Exorcist in the sense of the demons infecting living bodies, is pretty creative for the time. Basically, cursed words are spoken while a group of teenagers (or young adults, I can't really tell) are at a isolated mountain cabin and this wakes up demons which inhabit the bodies of the living. While the premise is pretty interesting, it is very formulaic. First off, there are FIVE friends as the main characters, the main character is a quiet, reserved guy, there's the arrogant, I can do anything type friend, and for Christ's sake, they're young adults ALL alone in the mountains in a small, creepy cabin. This movie just screams the HORROR genre. To the movie's credit though, the characters were picked off in an order I didn't expect, so it's not completely formula Horror style.Let's get right into this, plot holes and characters' decisions are the big downfall of this movie. I don't know if I ever rolled my eyes so much when watching a movie. There are a ton of them, so I list the ones I can remember. First off, why does the guy from the past on the tape actually say the cursed words that summon demons? Was he trying to bring horror to a bunch of random people in the mountains? I'd think that they be on a level beyond swear words, like since swear words are said on occasion when you're really mad, these words would never be said because they bring about the freaking apocalypse. Next, after they realize that the only way to get rid of these demons is body dismemberment, why don't they just take a shotgun to evil Cheryl's face then chainsaw her in pieces? This also brings up the question, why didn't evil Cheryl break out earlier? She showed at the end of the movie that she could just break the lock on the cellar, so why didn't she break out and sneak up on them when they weren't looking and just kill them all? It's obvious that that was the demon's goal was anyway, so why put it off? Then, once stupid Shelly becomes demon person number 2, the arrogant character seems to know what the hell he's doing and starts trying to kill her in many different ways, but the main character is just standing on the sidelines holding a dang ax doing nothing while his friend is beating up, and getting beat up by his girlfriend. Where the heck are this guy's balls? He knows that this isn't the same chick that he knew, so why doesn't he just help him out? You know this would be a great time for Cheryl to surprise her brother. Then the friend has to take the ax from him to kill Shelly for good. During this whole time, Linda has been snoozing up a storm not batting an eye. Why? Wouldn't she hear a demon screaming in the other room? Then Linda wakes up as demon number 3 after being stabbed by a pencil by Cheryl. This begs the question, how come Ash can have their blood all over him but not turn into a demon and Linda can just get stabbed by a pencil, not even like physical contact with the demon, and become infected? Then, once Ash finally seems like he's getting some balls and is about to dismember his girlfriend with a chainsaw, he stops because he looks at a necklace which holds no significant value, except that he gave it to her. Doesn't he know that she'll just come back as a demon and try to kill him? And on that note, for a large portion when Linda is a demon she just sits and stares at him and does nothing at all to try and kill him. Why? He's already dealing with another demon so why not just double team him to take him down? That was their goal, so why not set out to accomplish it? Skip ahead to the end, and all it takes to bring these guys down is to destroy a book that they found in the basement. If that's all it took, then why didn't he do it earlier? Nothing told him at that very moment to burn the book, so that tells me that he knew about this beforehand, so he could have just ended the crisis from the start by just burning it when Cheryl became a demon. Then in the last shot we see that everything seems fine and resolved, but then something comes up from behind and scares Ash white. What was it? It couldn't have been a demon, or at least it shouldn't have, because he burned the evil book, which seemed to do wonders to the other two in the room at the time. Maybe it was a scarecrow. I assume that we're suppose to believe it is another demon, but that doesn't make sense given that their book was destroyed. Maybe it was explained in the sequel, but the ending just doesn't make sense to me at all.There are tons of holes in this movie, and I don't get how people can just sit through all the BS that these characters do. I've heard the sequel is better, but I'm not going to hold out much hope given how disappointed I was with this one.

My one negative comment about the film would have to be the pathetic mama's boy protagonist, Freder. He literally faints at every sign of opposition, can't fight even the weakest villain, wears sissy parachute paints and too much makeup, and has a serious door problem. He runs around, falling in love at first sight and beating himself up at the thought of his love turning to the dark side, without ever trying to do anything about it except get himself into trouble. He gets bedridden after realizing Maria has gone to the dogs. And he can't save her when she's captured by the evil scientist because doors repeated keep closing on him and he doesn't recognize the pattern. As in the door opens, he walks through it, and it closes and locks. I could just picture him thinking the door opened! It must lead me to Maria! every single time it happened. It was almost sad to me that so talented and good a woman would fall for such a dunce.

Another great thing is the cinematography by Robby Müller, creating an European look to an American story set in 1800's.On the downer side comes a annoying and repetitive soundtrack composed by Neil Young, which seems out of place in some moments, very distractive. The film doesn't know how to hold its audience for too long; and there isn't much of a purpose neither a statement in the sense of telling something important.

The already mentioned quote says much about the film in a strange way, since this is a work that doesn't say anything new, or almost anything at all, but it has a silent and mysterious appeal to many audiences and for some odd reason I enjoyed it a lot, despite its emptiness.Good points favorable to Dead Man a good ensemble casting with names like Depp, Byrne, Iggy Pop, Robert Mithcum, Lance Henriksen, Michael Wincott, Alfred Molina, Jared Harris, Billy Bob Thornton, Crispin Glover and others, but most of them appear in small parts, and of course a great performance from Gary Farmer, who shadows Depp's character for the most part. Another great thing is the cinematography by Robby Müller, creating an European look to an American story set in 1800's.On the downer side comes a annoying and repetitive soundtrack composed by Neil Young, which seems out of place in some moments, very distractive. The film doesn't know how to hold its audience for too long; and there isn't much of a purpose neither a statement in the sense of telling something important. You can try and try again to find a meaning to it but there's none. Perhaps it's just a tribute to western directed by Jim Jarmusch (he made better things than this one, but still a good watchable film). The only thing that sounded like a meaning for this film comes of Depp's character, all he was trying to do is working out his own salvation, but instead he only got condemnation by killing several characters in the story.

Steven Spielberg's Jaws is brilliant, not only one of his best films but also the very movie that made me afraid to go into the sea.JawsThe Revenge didn't have that effect on me whatsoever. In alternative to giving genuine scares and thrills, the whole film is laughable. Especially in the plot, which is really quite inept, and in the climax, which is the epitome of WTF? JawsThe Revenge also has some embarrassingly cheesy dialogue and poor pacing. Then there's the direction, Spielberg's direction was one of the many things that made the 1975 film so good, but the direction here from Joseph Sargent is incompetent.The production values don't fare much better. The locations are quite nice but the cinematography and lighting are altogether unexceptional. The music is also disappointing, whereas the music was what made Jaws so unnerving in terms of mood, it was way too gimmicky here. The less said about Bruce the shark the better, he is not menacing at all, instead he is one of the many laughable assets of the film. Also he is not used well at all, and there is little to no build-up or suspense whenever he appears on screen. The acting is atrocious, the only actor who tries and the only redeeming quality is Michael Caine who deserves better. Lorraine Grey is annoyingly neurotic, while I was shocked that the talented late Judith Barsi would participate in such a mess, and her talents aren't even put to good use.

Here though, I felt that too much was not enough as we get two villains for the price of one, as The Penguin and Catwoman make their bows in Batman's rogues gallery meaning we get two origin stories, a changing shift of perspective and of course two big (or is that one?) deaths at the end. I can't fault the acting - as I said earlier, I like Keaton's calm demeanour as Bruce Wayne which turns to cold steel when he changes to his alter-ego, while Danny Devito, if never looking like my image of the comic-book Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer (who certainly does) obviously have fun wearing the clothes and hamming it up in the dark. Christopher Walken also gets in on the act as an un-costumed mega-rich do-badder who casually throws a pre-feline Selina Kyle out of a high-storey building amongst many other sins.Overall though, I felt the narrative was over-cluttered and that a shorter film concentrating on just one enemy would have made for a less demanding watch.

It's the perfect trifecta for your typical political thriller, which is what In the Line of Fire is. It's directed by Wolfgang Peterson, a German director who hit his highest mark in 1981 with Das Boot, a thrilling story about soldiers stranded in a German U-Boat during WWII. In the Line of Fire won't be the most memorable film you'll ever see, but it's a good film regardless. In it, Clint Eastwood plays Frank Horrigan, a long time member of the Secret Service who was alongside President John F. Kennedy when he was assassinated. Frank has always been haunted by this, and those fears really come back to life when a psychotic and elusive man named Mitch Leary, played excellently by John Malkovich, contacts him and tells him he plans on assassinating the current president. Frank makes it his mission to catch this nutcase and protect the president at all costs as he campaigns around the country. As a whole this movie falls just short of great, but still in the range of well worth watching.An entire movie from the perspective of the Secret Service agents is something I haven't seen much of, so that was one of the most interesting things about this film. Most of the characters in this film are given very human qualities, breaking the mold of the robotic, stoic Secret Service character stereotype. This is a film that shows the inner workings of the Secret Service and some of the conspiracy that goes on within the service. Eastwood's character makes the film the most interesting, as he is someone who wants to defend his own reputation and disprove the theories that he doesn't have what it takes anymore, while also showing undivided loyalty to protecting the president. He is obviously a man who has devoted his life to his job and also someone who, ever since that fateful day in Dallas 1963, has been trying to prove himself worthy and put his past behind him. Eastwood plays the character at just the right level of remorse, intensity, and respect.Undoubtedly the most interesting character of the film, however, is John Malkovich's Mitch Leary. His character is excellent and truly menacing. Malkovich is an odd looking guy, as we all know, and he uses his strange appearance to become much creepier for this role. He is the kind of subdued, passive-aggressive psychopath who you can never feel completely comfortable watching. His dialouge is written fantastically, riddle with double entendres, parallel structure, and darkly insightful proverbs. He makes for the best moments of the film and his character is what draws in most of the emotion of the film, especially alongside Eastwood and the relationship that develops between those two characters. Leary wants to be remembered and he wants to be written into history, never to be forgotten. He drags Frank into the mix in order to share his experience with someone else on the presidents side. He's a true psycho, making his character a lot of fun to watch operate.In the Line of Fire is a good movie, but when looked at in the overall spectrum of political thrillers, it isn't something very revolutionary or groundbreaking. The story is fun, despite some kinks such as a romantic subplot that is awkward and serves no real purpose to the main storyline. The characters are fun and their dialouge is written very well, making for a consistently exciting two hours of film. Eastwood and Malkovich are fantastic and the interactions between their characters are the most intriguing and interesting thing about this movie. But the movie seems to lack a certain umph that is needed to make a movie memorable. I don't regret watching the movie, but I feel like I'll forget about this one within a week.

I'm taking the time to post this edited version of a review I wrote back when I first saw the film (opening night, 1998) not because I think anyone on this site will care (or even read it), but because I feel compelled to work on covering a wide variety of my favorite films on this site. I watched the film again a few days ago (probably at least my twentieth viewing), and wanted to reflect on the differences in the initial viewing experience compared to this recent one.Saving Private Ryan is a film about honor, at its core, and is as genuine a salute to men who have laid down their lives for their country as anyone could ask. Director Spielberg and writer Robert Rodat deliver a ferocious look at the intensity of modern close combat and its effects on its participants, and raise questions for which there are no confident answers, if indeed there ever have been any at all.The structure of the film is symmetric, opening and closing in a Normandy military cemetery, where an aging vet and his family visit the grave of a fallen comrade. Book-ended between are two blisteringly enervating combat sequences and an episodic journey through horror and hard questions.I say the film is about honor, and it is. What else is an act of saving someone else if not an act of honor? And in the process of doing so, the most difficult of all choices must be made--whether to sacrifice one's own life that others might live, or make the other poor, dumb bastard die for his country. Spielberg's exploration of this dilemma follows several paths and, in keeping with the general tenor of the film--terrifying, numbing, disorienting, and possessed of a great sorrow--he never provides sophistic or glib answers. He leaves us at film's end still reeling from the dense insanity of a desperate bridge defense, with an old man who after all the passing years still struggles with unanswerable questions.Where is the honor in war? What is the relative value of a man's life? On a personal level, is there anything worth the risk of unimaginable pain and suffering? Other films have tackled these questions in the past, but rarely had such visceral impact. A sniper's duel culminates in a blasted eye socket that makes the audience cringe; a sapper is blown to jelly by a defective sticky bomb an excruciating knife fight in which the victor soothes his dying opponent almost crucifies the audience with its grim denouement. Critics have harped on the unrelenting violence as pandering to a jaded, bloodthirsty audience, but they miss the point. Spielberg goes so far beyond the limits of typical cinematic Grand Guignol that no one can mistake the overt nature of the message killing people, especially ones that are trying to kill you, is a brutish, messy business, and no one in their right mind has any desire to engage in the trade any more than they might be otherwise compelled.After an opening 25-minute barrage that sets the tone, Spielberg and Rodat's story begins to unfold. Capt. John Miller (Tom Forrest Gump Hanks) must lead a squad of his men through a highly fluid battle zone in search of a Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Good Will Hunting Damon), the sole surviving brother of four. Ryan is somewhere behind enemy lines, a trooper of the scattered 101st Airborne Division, who had dropped the night before the invasion. It is D+3 and Miller has orders from General George Marshall to bring Ryan out of the raging Normandy battle, to be returned to the safety of his motherland and his family. And so we set off on a trek through hell, a journey that will leave most of its participants dead.Each man in the squad is an archetype, and a symbol. Pvt.Caparzo (Vin Pitch Black Diesel) is Innocence, The Child. Wade, the medic (Giovanni SubUrbia Ribisi), is Mercy, The Angel. Mellish, a Jewish soldier (Adam Dazed and Confused Goldberg), and Jackson, the prayerful sharpshooter (Barry 61* Pepper), embody twin motivations of Retribution and Righteousness, the Hammer and the Sword, while Sgt. Horvath (Tom Natural Born Killers Sizemore) and Capt. Miller serve as Fortitude and Conscience, dual engines of strength and courage that keep the small patrol on its fated course.These are the ones who perish--each slain in ascending order of significance within the simple tapestry of the plot--the human qualities that are inevitably stripped from a man as he confronts the implacable juggernaut of war. The only ones to survive the charnelhouse are Pvt. Rieben (Ed The Brothers McMullen Burns), the Witness, Chance (I was born lucky, Captain!), and tag-along interpreter Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Spanking the Monkey Davies), the Everyman audience surrogate, the Fool. Ultimately, it is he who must make the crucial moral choice of the film.Saving Private Ryan is not a comfortable film experience. Overly sensitive film-goers will probably be overwhelmed by it; if they can make it through the Omaha beach sequence, they'll do okay. For the rest of us, it's a film worthy of the accolades it has so far received. Personally, I was a bit surprised that it didn't get the Oscar for Best Picture over Shakespeare in Love, especially since Spielberg got the nod for Best Director. Such are the whims of the Academy. Never mind. It takes nothing away from the raw power of Saving Private Ryan.Addendum one noticeable difference between the theatrical and home video experience is visual. The stuttery, bleached-out quality of the film (primarily in the battle sequences) is much reduced in the transfer to small screen presentation. It's not a tremendous flaw, but moves me to definitely recommend a theatrical viewing should it ever present itself.

John Miller (Tom Forrest Gump Hanks) must lead a squad of his men through a highly fluid battle zone in search of a Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Good Will Hunting Damon), the sole surviving brother of four. Ryan is somewhere behind enemy lines, a trooper of the scattered 101st Airborne Division, who had dropped the night before the invasion. It is D+3 and Miller has orders from General George Marshall to bring Ryan out of the raging Normandy battle, to be returned to the safety of his motherland and his family. And so we set off on a trek through hell, a journey that will leave most of its participants dead.Each man in the squad is an archetype, and a symbol. Pvt.Caparzo (Vin Pitch Black Diesel) is Innocence, The Child. Wade, the medic (Giovanni SubUrbia Ribisi), is Mercy, The Angel. Mellish, a Jewish soldier (Adam Dazed and Confused Goldberg), and Jackson, the prayerful sharpshooter (Barry 61* Pepper), embody twin motivations of Retribution and Righteousness, the Hammer and the Sword, while Sgt. Horvath (Tom Natural Born Killers Sizemore) and Capt. Miller serve as Fortitude and Conscience, dual engines of strength and courage that keep the small patrol on its fated course.These are the ones who perish--each slain in ascending order of significance within the simple tapestry of the plot--the human qualities that are inevitably stripped from a man as he confronts the implacable juggernaut of war. The only ones to survive the charnelhouse are Pvt. Rieben (Ed The Brothers McMullen Burns), the Witness, Chance (I was born lucky, Captain!), and tag-along interpreter Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Spanking the Monkey Davies), the Everyman audience surrogate, the Fool. Ultimately, it is he who must make the crucial moral choice of the film.Saving Private Ryan is not a comfortable film experience. Overly sensitive film-goers will probably be overwhelmed by it; if they can make it through the Omaha beach sequence, they'll do okay. For the rest of us, it's a film worthy of the accolades it has so far received. Personally, I was a bit surprised that it didn't get the Oscar for Best Picture over Shakespeare in Love, especially since Spielberg got the nod for Best Director. Such are the whims of the Academy. Never mind. It takes nothing away from the raw power of Saving Private Ryan.Addendum one noticeable difference between the theatrical and home video experience is visual. The stuttery, bleached-out quality of the film (primarily in the battle sequences) is much reduced in the transfer to small screen presentation. It's not a tremendous flaw, but moves me to definitely recommend a theatrical viewing should it ever present itself.

I'm taking the time to post this edited version of a review I wrote back when I first saw the film (opening night, 1998) not because I think anyone on this site will care (or even read it), but because I feel compelled to work on covering a wide variety of my favorite films on this site. I watched the film again a few days ago (probably at least my twentieth viewing), and wanted to reflect on the differences in the initial viewing experience compared to this recent one.Saving Private Ryan is a film about honor, at its core, and is as genuine a salute to men who have laid down their lives for their country as anyone could ask. Director Spielberg and writer Robert Rodat deliver a ferocious look at the intensity of modern close combat and its effects on its participants, and raise questions for which there are no confident answers, if indeed there ever have been any at all.The structure of the film is symmetric, opening and closing in a Normandy military cemetery, where an aging vet and his family visit the grave of a fallen comrade. Book-ended between are two blisteringly enervating combat sequences and an episodic journey through horror and hard questions.I say the film is about honor, and it is. What else is an act of saving someone else if not an act of honor? And in the process of doing so, the most difficult of all choices must be made--whether to sacrifice one's own life that others might live, or make the other poor, dumb bastard die for his country. Spielberg's exploration of this dilemma follows several paths and, in keeping with the general tenor of the film--terrifying, numbing, disorienting, and possessed of a great sorrow--he never provides sophistic or glib answers. He leaves us at film's end still reeling from the dense insanity of a desperate bridge defense, with an old man who after all the passing years still struggles with unanswerable questions.Where is the honor in war? What is the relative value of a man's life? On a personal level, is there anything worth the risk of unimaginable pain and suffering? Other films have tackled these questions in the past, but rarely had such visceral impact. A sniper's duel culminates in a blasted eye socket that makes the audience cringe; a sapper is blown to jelly by a defective sticky bomb an excruciating knife fight in which the victor soothes his dying opponent almost crucifies the audience with its grim denouement. Critics have harped on the unrelenting violence as pandering to a jaded, bloodthirsty audience, but they miss the point. Spielberg goes so far beyond the limits of typical cinematic Grand Guignol that no one can mistake the overt nature of the message killing people, especially ones that are trying to kill you, is a brutish, messy business, and no one in their right mind has any desire to engage in the trade any more than they might be otherwise compelled.After an opening 25-minute barrage that sets the tone, Spielberg and Rodat's story begins to unfold.

I was somewhat skeptical upon hearing this, but that night I rented and watched it. Do the Right Thing is set in a primarily African-American area of New York City during the hottest day of the year, and is centered around an Italian-owned pizzeria. The first thing I noticed about the film was that it was absolutely brimming with the essence of the late '80s. The colors were bright, the music was relatively corny, and the costumes were strangely elaborate. I'm not a huge fan of the late '80s culture, but somehow the film was able to combine these features into a very watchable form. I was able to watch the entire movie without interruption (which is a pretty remarkable feat for me). As the story unfolded, I found myself becoming more and more frustrated. I believe that this frustration may have been intended by Spike Lee, but it somewhat diminished my enjoyment overall. Everyone in the film was so angry all the time, with the exception of Danny Aiello's character for the most part. I found myself repeatedly at my boiling point of rage when I saw how much ignorance was portrayed in the film. It seemed that much of the movie was sympathetic towards racism, as many of the situations that would rouse sympathy for African Americans were caused by their own ignorant actions. Most notably, the actions of Giancarlo Esposito's character struck me as extremely inflammatory. This film taught me one important lesson, however Ignorance leads only to more ignorance. I was glad when, at the end, the text shown alluded to that idea. Before then, I was somewhat disappointed with the film, really. I felt like it was a movie that merely hated the white man, which wouldn't really appeal to a middle-class white kid like myself. Overall, though, I thought that this movie was pretty great, and for all my gripes, the story came together very well and exceeded the sum of its parts. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 February 2011","score":"","review":" I decided to watch this movie after an English teacher of mine touted it as the greatest film ever made.
