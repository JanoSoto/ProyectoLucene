[{"date":"19 November 2005","score":"","review":" Scream 3, directed by the horror legend Wes Craven, is incorrectly regarded as one of the better in the series. It is most definitely the worst, probably due to a different writer. The previous two films were written by Kevin Williamson, this was written by Ehren Kruger. This movie doesn't have the same jist the others had. The deaths are boring and tame, the dialogue isn't as witty and the movie just has a feel of being poorly done.Sidney (Neve Campbell) is in hiding. She has isolated herself from the world. Stab 3 is in production but there is one problem. The cast are being killed of one-by-one (as you would have guessed by now). There is a twist though, the killer is leaving pictures of Maureen Presscott, Sidney's mother, at every death scene. This draws Sidney out of hiding into a final confrontation with the killer.The acting in Scream 3 is, as with all the Scream films, very good. Neve Campbell is always great as Sidney, David Arquette always good as Dewey and Courtney Cox-Arquette hilarious as Gale Weathers. The supporting cast is great again. Parkey Posey is the stand-out as Jennifer Jolie. There is also Patrick Dempsey as Detective Kincaid, Scott Foley as Roman Bridger and Jenny McCarthy as Sarah.The few problems I (and many other people) have are the following 1. The deaths in this are just not creative or scary enough. In this almost every death is a stab in the back.2. There is not enough witty, movie based dialogue in this.3. The ending seemed to quick. A lot of deaths were shoved into the end.Other then these annoyances it is still an enjoyable movie. If only Williamson wrote it.2½\/5.
