Usually a movie being held this long is a bad thing--indicating, most often, that the movie is a dud. However, this great channel indicated that because the previous Hope & Crosby film was so popular, it stayed in theaters longer and the studio decided to wait until 1946 for The Road to Utopia.The style of this film is rather different from previous ones in two ways. First, the film begins with an elderly Hope married to an elderly Dorothy Lamour--the one and only time that Bob got her in one of the Road films AND the only one that is, essentially, entirely in flashback. Second, it is narrated by the raconteur, Robert Benchley, who interrupts the film periodically to make comments about it. But, as usual, this film still finds the two men as partners and chiselers. Their fraudulent stage act is discovered and they decide to relocate--heading to the Yukon and the gold rush at the beginning of the 20th century.Along the way, the pair are mistaken for two famous killers, Sperry and McGuirk, and they take full advantage of it! Everyone in town is so afraid of them that they give them anything they want--and they plan on living like kings. Lamour and her confederates think the pair are Sperry and McGuirk and sets out to weasel the secret of a gold mine from them--a gold mine that they think they boys have but don't.This film is pretty much what you'd expect, though Hope's one-liners are amazingly flat compared to other Road films. But, on the positive side, I liked how the film broke through the fourth wall repeatedly--making fun of itself, the studio and the roving commentary about the film by Hope and Benchley. As a result, it was a lot of fun--and a bit better than the typical Road film.

But while it still ranks as one of the best epics in movie history, the passing decades have also recast it as one of the greatest cinematic testaments to the awesome power of distance that so dominated the affairs of men before the 20th century.T.E. Lawrence was a British army officer serving without distinction in Cairo during World War I who was dispatched by his country's foreign service to Arabia. His assignment was to observe and evaluate the fractured nature of the land and its Arab tribes and their ability to assist the British war effort against the Turkish Ottoman Empire. What Lawrence did was what no one since Saladin himself had achieved. He united the Arab people and led them to an astonishing victory, only to see that victory and Lawrence's dreams for the Arabs shattered against the relentless and unforgiving way of the world.It's hard to say which ranks first with this film. Is it the stunning, captivating bleakness of director David Lean's desert vistas or is it the electrifying and heart breaking Peter O'Toole as Lawrence? They each rank among the best work of their kind you'll ever see. I think the edge has to go to O'Toole because the vast landscapes and searing open spaces that Lean throws up on the screen would dwarf the efforts of most actors. Lean creates a world that emphasizes the smallness of man, making it that much harder for O'Toole to imbue Lawrence with a larger-than-life essence. That is exactly what O'Toole does, however, crafting Lawrence as a figure of staggering potential who finds his greatness realized and then spoiled by mundane realities even he cannot overpower by force of will.O'Toole is back up by a slew of other fine actors, particularly Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif and rival Arab chieftains who first doubt and then come to believe in Lawrence when he no longer does. Claude Rains is also almost unforgettable as Dryden the diplomat. He and Lawrence represent the twin sides of the British Empire. Lawrence is the heroism and the high ideals; Dryden the calculating, self interested reality those ideals were too frequently tamed by.Watching this movie today, beyond being grandly entertaining, is also a primer on the primacy of distance in human affairs. Though the locomotive had helped shrink much of the West by the end of the 19th century, other parts of the globe like Arabia remained trapped in the iron grip of how difficult it was to get from here to there. Before the airplane truly revolutionized travel, the most towering challenge that faced any man or people wasn't doing what they needed to do. It was getting where they needed to go in order to do it. When you can board a jet today, fly across the international dateline and disembark on the other side of the world yesterday, there may be no better way than watching Lawrence of Arabia to understand the limitations imposed on humanity by the burden of pre-Jet Age travel.Now, this film is long. I mean, it's loooooooooong. They stopped making movies this length over a generation ago. As entrancing as it is, and even with an intermission, this is still a viewing that requires some commitment. That's particularly the case because the second half where Lawrence is broken down by the burdens of his greatness and the immutable nature of his era is intentionally meant to be disappointing and dispiriting, at least on some level.Taking all in all, Lawrence of Arabia isn't merely an outstanding motion picture. This is a legitimate must see for everyone out there. If you haven't seen it, go rent it&#x85;though you might want to be sure and get it over the weekend so you've got time to watch it.

While the likes of Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine seem to be competing against each other to see who can chew up the most scenery, such is their over-acting. None of this hurts the film though, it's all for the greater good. It also makes me chuckle to think that the most ridiculous screen couple in cinematic history &#x96; Martin and Nonnie &#x96; actually couldn't bear each other in real-life, and only inter-acted when they had to shoot a scene. In addition it is an absolute impossibility to watch Leslie Nielsen as the captain of the ship without thinking of his comic turn in the disaster movie spoof Airplane!Despite all this the movie works as a good adventure film. The setting of the up-turned ship is great, and is used to good effect. There are a number of nicely staged set-pieces throughout that ensure that the pace never gets bogged down. The New Year's Eve aspect also works in its favour as it ensures the movie will always be a festive season staple, which certainly adds to its overall appeal.

His unconcerned incessant upbeat chat was, I suppose, meant to reflect the innocence of youth but really it made you actually think that he was either moderately autistic or annoying beyond belief; my guess was it was probably the latter and I wouldn't have blamed the group if they had decided to throw him in the sea.Overall, a good bit of escapist hokum.

This Hester runs and skips and talks to the animals on the Sabbath and is punished for this(?). In the process, she is taken under the wing of the local minister--changing the story significantly from the Hawthorne of the tale. In the original story, it begins with a pregnant Hester being labeled an adulteress and ostracized by the community--how she fell in love and the sort of woman she was before this was never really part of the original story--here, there is a lot of back story--so much that who the father is of the illegitimate child never is in question. It's obvious that the minister is the sperm donor and the film is much more about WHY the affair began.Aside from this unusual reworking of the story, this MGM production is first-rate. The costumes are excellent, the direction very good and the acting (aside from just a couple times where Gish over-acted--in a style that would have been fine in her early films--when such reactions were the norm) was very good. In fact, it's probably the best version I have seen--far better than the 1930s version or the god-awful Demi Moore version (where they gave this bleak story a happy ending!!!). So, even with an odd reworking and an incomplete ending (the film stopped at the death of the minister--whereas the book continued beyond this), it's about as good as you may find. Now there COULD be a better version out there and I'd love to hear any suggestions about a more definitive version (if it's available).By the way, although the print looks great, at about the one hour mark it really deteriorated.

Having watched it for the first time recently without reading very many reviews or hearing much about the plot, I was able to interpret the character of Chance considerably different than I have seen done in almost every review I've read of this film.Where in the film does the character of Chance prove his retardation? Sure the woman who raised him claims he is stupid, but this cannot be regarded as definitive. Imagine a perfectly normal person, isolated from culture and society, who's sole occupation is gardening and who otherwise knows nothing except that which is on television. Naturally this person would have very little notion of how the world actually works, how to engage in the culture of the day or how to perform certain societal functions. This lack of knowledge was certainly evident throughout the movie and perhaps gave many audience members the idea that Chance is truly mentally handicapped.But what if he isn't? Maybe I'm simply a victim of the ingenuous Chauncey, but I truly believe that those who slide Chance into the category of mentally challenged are missing a large part of this movie. Think about it, from Chance's perspective what he does is entirely logical. He believes that what he sees on television is reality and when he finds himself engaged in what he saw on television, he realizes that he now is part of that reality. Most importantly he believes that he has the power to change that reality at will, first he tries the remote, but eventually he begins to use the only other tool he has gardening.From there it is fascinating what he begins to do - he takes the only real knowledge he possesses and applies it to the real world problems he is asked about. He takes his incredible knowledge of gardening and given that simple, yet incredibly deep, knowledge he begins to create a moral framework which drives both his conversation and his actions towards the characters.In this way, Chance's gardening knowledge is really his ethical core. This knowledge centers around a great value for life and an incredible understanding of how that life should be cared for and loved. This philosophy carries over into his political insights as well as his clear concern for Ben and especially his wife.I think the doctor is the only character who truly realizes Chance's genius despite his apparent duplicity (Chauncey). He finds out that Chance is really a gardener, but at the same time he understands the good Chance has done for Ben in the waning years of his life, along with his wife.Under this interpretation of Chance, the ending makes perfect sense. Chance's fantastic televised view of reality (where anything is possible) combined with his clear sense of purpose (or being?) - as represented by his gardener aspect - create a moment in which Chance transcends our view of reality to discover wholly unknown truth. He walks on water.To me that moment in the film is where the character of Chance suddenly comes into sharp focus. Here is a man who is distinctly separate from society's assumptions and self-imposed limitations and contradictions, yet possessed by a simple love for life which drives his moral being in a direction that society ultimately wants to go. To Chance, there is nothing that can get in the way of achieving this moral goal; like on TV, the possibilities are endless, the impossible possible. Read that last paragraph again. Now tell me you wouldn't want a man like that as president...Clearly this movie is on to something.

To Chance, there is nothing that can get in the way of achieving this moral goal; like on TV, the possibilities are endless, the impossible possible. Read that last paragraph again. Now tell me you wouldn't want a man like that as president...Clearly this movie is on to something. ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"22 November 2010","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" This film is all about Chance, Peter Seller's character, how you understand this character dictates how you interpret the movie as a whole. Having watched it for the first time recently without reading very many reviews or hearing much about the plot, I was able to interpret the character of Chance considerably different than I have seen done in almost every review I've read of this film.Where in the film does the character of Chance prove his retardation? Sure the woman who raised him claims he is stupid, but this cannot be regarded as definitive. Imagine a perfectly normal person, isolated from culture and society, who's sole occupation is gardening and who otherwise knows nothing except that which is on television. Naturally this person would have very little notion of how the world actually works, how to engage in the culture of the day or how to perform certain societal functions. This lack of knowledge was certainly evident throughout the movie and perhaps gave many audience members the idea that Chance is truly mentally handicapped.But what if he isn't? Maybe I'm simply a victim of the ingenuous Chauncey, but I truly believe that those who slide Chance into the category of mentally challenged are missing a large part of this movie. Think about it, from Chance's perspective what he does is entirely logical. He believes that what he sees on television is reality and when he finds himself engaged in what he saw on television, he realizes that he now is part of that reality. Most importantly he believes that he has the power to change that reality at will, first he tries the remote, but eventually he begins to use the only other tool he has gardening.From there it is fascinating what he begins to do - he takes the only real knowledge he possesses and applies it to the real world problems he is asked about. He takes his incredible knowledge of gardening and given that simple, yet incredibly deep, knowledge he begins to create a moral framework which drives both his conversation and his actions towards the characters.In this way, Chance's gardening knowledge is really his ethical core. This knowledge centers around a great value for life and an incredible understanding of how that life should be cared for and loved. This philosophy carries over into his political insights as well as his clear concern for Ben and especially his wife.I think the doctor is the only character who truly realizes Chance's genius despite his apparent duplicity (Chauncey). He finds out that Chance is really a gardener, but at the same time he understands the good Chance has done for Ben in the waning years of his life, along with his wife.Under this interpretation of Chance, the ending makes perfect sense. Chance's fantastic televised view of reality (where anything is possible) combined with his clear sense of purpose (or being?) - as represented by his gardener aspect - create a moment in which Chance transcends our view of reality to discover wholly unknown truth. He walks on water.To me that moment in the film is where the character of Chance suddenly comes into sharp focus. Here is a man who is distinctly separate from society's assumptions and self-imposed limitations and contradictions, yet possessed by a simple love for life which drives his moral being in a direction that society ultimately wants to go. To Chance, there is nothing that can get in the way of achieving this moral goal; like on TV, the possibilities are endless, the impossible possible. Read that last paragraph again.

Upon my viewing 9 years ago I could understand why censor boards in other countries had to adopt a harsh and strict attitude towards the movie. In this present day a movie such as this would not be considered violent or brutal at all due to many laws that have been amended and altered over the past few years. The average movie goers attitudes towards perceiving movies has changed considerably. This can be one reason for why many movies that are disturbing as this are released with only a few minor cuts.Tobe Hooper the director had managed to create a new trend in the horror genre which led to characters like Freddy Kruger and Micheal myers to come on screen. This is one of Hooper's best works to date. Despite the low budget he has managed to make a movie that cuts to the core of the movie watcher's mind. 'The Poltergeist' and 'The Mangler' I consider also to be movies of his that are worth watching too. Unfortunately Hooper's career has been left to nothing but producing franchise movies and giving rights to remakes. He had a lot of potential to sustain a good directing career.I had a terrifying experience the first time I watched the movie. The only other two movies that I feel would match up to the level as this would be 'The last house on the left' and 'The exorcist'. These movies too grind to the nerve. The frightening factor of TCM roots from continuous non stop screaming that the female character of Marilyn Burns evokes. Her display of terror and struggle was very convincing and contributes heavily towards making the movie a cult classic. If her acting was not so realistic maybe the movie would not have been so successful. The movie was shot in a grainy documentary style to give the viewer the feeling of realism. The low production value does not deter the movie from generating so much fear on a small scale. Special mention has to be given to the cinematography department. Many wide angle shots at a slow rate are a delight to watch. This helped to bring a feeling of suspense and was very stylish. The background score which is simple as can be, was suited to the relevant scenes helped create the correct atmosphere. My only complaint with the movie was the lack of face value. Casting some established actors would have made the movie enjoyable to watch.

Bruce Campbell already stands out a bit from the others in my eyes, although he does vastly improve the quality of his performance in the sequel. The cast here is secondary, the atmosphere set up by the very creative and clever photography being its strongest point. Tom Philo came up with interesting visuals, under the guide of Sam Raimi. Our director creates a true sense of terror and helplessness just from the way it's shot, for example one of the opening sequences as the characters arrive at our cabin. It's just so ominous.This is greatly helped by one of the few good horror composers, Joseph LoDuca. The music was chilling and got to your nerves every time you hear it. The effects are good old 80s material, which I prefer when it comes to the horror genre. CGI can ruin an otherwise good horror film; alas I am Legend. The makeup was gruesome and the photography effects just plain scared the hell out of me! The movie hits you hard with excellent carnage and some very disturbing shots, like that infamous tree scene.

When they die in a car accident they become ghosts and must haunt it for a century. To make matters worse, the house is bought by the less-than-lovable Deetz from the big city. Can the Maitlands somehow use their spook smarts to get rid of the new tenants ?This movie is in equal parts charming, funny, crazy and touching, and although he had made one feature before it (Pee-wee's Big Adventure), it's really an introduction to The Crazy World Of Tim Burton. This is a universe of engaging, interesting characters - a lonely teenage girl, a wholesome Norman Rockwell couple, a frustrated would-be artist - but also a film where dead citizens need to find the right office to process their claim to the afterlife, bad sculptures start moving and attack people, and the groom at a climactic wedding scene removes a severed finger from the ring in his pocket with assurances to his bride-to-be that, She meant nothing to me !. Burton has an almost unique knack of combining his wacky ideas and insane visuals with solid entertainment values; homespun humour, agreeable drama and wry observations. Even if the messages in his movies are as simple as it's good to listen to some Harry Belafonte once in a while, they're delivered with panache and are more profound than a lot of so-called grown-up films aspire to be. The whole cast here are obviously having a ball, and Keaton is motormouth hilarious in the showstopping part, but for me the two best players are sixteen-year-old Ryder in the pivotal role of Lydia, who manages to be both hilarious (I, myself, am strange and unusual.) and tender, and O'Hara as the wicked stepmom whose rendition of Day-O alone is worth seeing the whole movie for. Speaking of music, this is also composer Danny Elfman's calling card film - starting with a delicious brass-thumping main theme, it's shot through with outstanding musical moments which get progressively weirder and more operatic as the mayhem surges. A note about the title of this film, which I must confess I don't quite understand. According to IMDb, it's formally Beetle Juice (two words), despite the fact that the title card for the movie has it written as one word, and it surely comes from the character, whose name is not only definitely one word, but is also spelled Betelgeuse (as in the star in the constellation of Orion). I smell the stench of movie executives who can't even read let alone spell. Brilliantly written by Larry Wilson, Warren Skaaren and Michael McDowell (a great horror scribbler, who also worked on George A.

When they die in a car accident they become ghosts and must haunt it for a century. To make matters worse, the house is bought by the less-than-lovable Deetz from the big city. Can the Maitlands somehow use their spook smarts to get rid of the new tenants ?This movie is in equal parts charming, funny, crazy and touching, and although he had made one feature before it (Pee-wee's Big Adventure), it's really an introduction to The Crazy World Of Tim Burton. This is a universe of engaging, interesting characters - a lonely teenage girl, a wholesome Norman Rockwell couple, a frustrated would-be artist - but also a film where dead citizens need to find the right office to process their claim to the afterlife, bad sculptures start moving and attack people, and the groom at a climactic wedding scene removes a severed finger from the ring in his pocket with assurances to his bride-to-be that, She meant nothing to me !. Burton has an almost unique knack of combining his wacky ideas and insane visuals with solid entertainment values; homespun humour, agreeable drama and wry observations. Even if the messages in his movies are as simple as it's good to listen to some Harry Belafonte once in a while, they're delivered with panache and are more profound than a lot of so-called grown-up films aspire to be. The whole cast here are obviously having a ball, and Keaton is motormouth hilarious in the showstopping part, but for me the two best players are sixteen-year-old Ryder in the pivotal role of Lydia, who manages to be both hilarious (I, myself, am strange and unusual.) and tender, and O'Hara as the wicked stepmom whose rendition of Day-O alone is worth seeing the whole movie for. Speaking of music, this is also composer Danny Elfman's calling card film - starting with a delicious brass-thumping main theme, it's shot through with outstanding musical moments which get progressively weirder and more operatic as the mayhem surges. A note about the title of this film, which I must confess I don't quite understand. According to IMDb, it's formally Beetle Juice (two words), despite the fact that the title card for the movie has it written as one word, and it surely comes from the character, whose name is not only definitely one word, but is also spelled Betelgeuse (as in the star in the constellation of Orion). I smell the stench of movie executives who can't even read let alone spell. Brilliantly written by Larry Wilson, Warren Skaaren and Michael McDowell (a great horror scribbler, who also worked on George A. Romero's Tales From The Darkside movie \/ TV show, adapted The Nightmare Before Christmas and scripted Stephen King's novel Thinner), this is a fabulously funny feelgood spook story.

For every Rider On The Rain, Red Sun, The Mechanic, Mr. Majestyk, or Hard Times there was a good deal more movies like Cold Sweat, Love And Bullets, St. Ives, and all of his 80's material(though I admit to liking Death Wish 3 and 4 as b movie ridiculousness). Now My point is, many will tell you Death Wish is his masterpiece, and though I don't quite agree it's undeniably the best of the series and does show that he had hidden acting skills that unfortunately weren't tested often enough.Everyone knows the story by now Architect Paul Kersey, when coming home from work finds that his wife and daughter have been raped. He then goes on a business trip where a guy there re arouses Kersey's interest in guns, he comes home where he finds said guy gave him a gun for a present. Kersey uses it in self defense at first against the mugger, and finds he gets great relief in it. He then begins posing as mugger bait for revenge on the kind of people that raped his wife and daughter.It's a pretty good movie. The action is restrained, and has a lot of suspense in it leading up to the actual killing, the dialogue is surprisingly well written given the genre, and it's quite compelling. Though I give it an 7, it's really more of a 7.4. The thing that makes it above average is it really shows the effect violence can have on someone, and the how someone will attempt to escape their problems through it. Sure it seems like he's solving the problem to him, but as the movie unfolds you certainly get a sense of the wrongness in his actions. Self defense is one thing, getting revenge is one thing, taking it out on a large group of people whom despite being a problem and a nuisance, don't quite deserve death.It's a well told story, but the points it's trying to make are hard to find at first, and could have been done slightly more effectively, but it's nevertheless a pretty good movie. But the reason it isn't Bronson's best is because it doesn't quite succeed at doing what it sets out to do but also because he has movies like Once Upon A Time In The West(his masterpiece), Hard Times, and Red Sun which are my personal favorites and I would argue far outclass this. Nevertheless it's a very enjoyable movie thanks to the strong performances, good screenplay, well done action scenes, and a great score.

The following day another tape is left outside their door which show's the house again but whoever filmed it going inside & filming them both asleep in bed, shocked Fred & Renee call the police who take note of the incident. After a party Fred finds a third tape that show's him standing over Renee's dead & bloodied body, Fred then abruptly wakes up to find himself sentenced to death for Renee's murder. While on death row Fred goes to sleep one night & inexplicably wakes up as a different person, a young car mechanic named Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty), baffled the police let him go free to return to his life. However Pete has an affair with Alice Wakefield (Patricia Aquette), the girlfriend of a violent man named Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia) but not all is as it seems in a bizarre world where anything can happen...This French & American co-production was co-written & directed by cult director David Lynch & Lost Highway is as culty as any of his other films, after a five year absence from making films after the critical & financial failure of Twin Peaks Fire Walk with Me (1992) he storms back onto the silver screen with yet another bizarre, surreal & often incomprehensible thriller that really has no logic or sense to it at all. To be fair to Lost Highway the first forty odd minutes are great, the deep mystery surrounding the videotapes, the murder of Renee, the strange little things that keep happening like the message telling Fred that 'Dick Laurent is dead' & the bizarre encounter with a creepy man at a party who seems able to be in two places at once but once Fred transforms into Pete the film never recovers from such an audacious & frankly odd moment. All the intriguing videotape & murder angle is abandoned completely & is frustratingly never explained, sure there are the odd character that is the same or the odd line of dialogue or the odd reference to what has gone before but for all intents & purposes Lost Highway completely changes it's main character's, it's location & it's entire plot about halfway through & it's a rather jarring experience. The boring romance between Pete & Alice had me wanting to know what happened to Fred & who killed his wife even more, sure Fred makes an appearance at the end but what actually happens during the final ten minutes or so is anyone's guess, quite simply it's incomprehensible & makes less than zero sense. There's a nice reference back to the opening scene but otherwise I was just baffled by the end like I am sure most people will be, Lost Highway just isn't that satisfying as it never delivers anything substantial or even concludes any of it's various plot lines. Lost Highway is a really strange film, it really does make no sense despite all the 'theories' that people have written & posted on the web, I suppose if you have to think about the symbolism & commentary too much like me then the film isn't clicking with you, to fully enjoy & appreciate a unique & different film like Lost Highway it's messages & parallels should be obvious & instinctive so maybe if you have to think about it too much it didn't work for you as well as maybe it might other's. At over two hours long Lost Highway is sometimes a slog to get through but I always found it fascinating & hoped that it would deliver on it's inventive build-up & narrative but it never does & it just fizzles out as it gets weirder & weirder as it loses all touch with reality & logic.Lost Highway is a great looking & very stylish film, I can imagine a director like Lynch wanting everything perfect. Apparently Fred & Renee's house in the film is actually where Lynch was living at the time he made Lost Highway & which he designed, it's a very modern home with a slightly odd look & feel about it that sets you on edge & works in the film perfectly. Lynch has said the 'Dick Laurent is dead' incident actually happened to himself in real life, he also states that he was inspired by the O.J. Simpson trial while writing Lost Highway. For some odd reason although filmed & released in 1997 Lost Highway wasn't released on DVD in the US until 2008. There's a bit of violence & gore here, there's a nasty slit throat & a bit of blood splatter as a guy is impaled on a glass coffee table(!). There's a fair amount of sex & nudity too, Patricia Arquette strips a few times & there's a few sex scenes here.With a supposed budget of about $15,000,000 this had quite a decent budget, it's extremely well made with striking production design & visuals. The acting is very good from a solid cast, Bill Pullman is great even if he gets to sit out the middle hour while Patricia Arquette is very sexy here, Robert Loggia & Robert Blake are both suitably creepy as the bad guy's.Lost Highway is a film I enjoyed for hat it was, a collection of striking images & visuals randomly strewn together in a bizarre plot that made zero sense to me. Sure, you could say part of the fun & charm is coming up with your own theory & what Lost Highway actually means to you n a personal level but for me it meant nothing overall & I really don't want to be spending hours dissecting a film in some attempt to find the meaning of life or reality or whatever Lynch was aiming for.
