The plot is very far fetched of course, but the terrific all star cast and a great performance by Ewan MacGregor make this a very enjoyable movie.  There is also few moments in the film that are actually very funny, especially the scene with Maury Chaykin(Dances With Wolves, My Cousin Vinnie) as the paranoid mountain man, which really made me laugh.  Although its not the best movie ive ever seen, It was cute and I'll watch it again. ***1\/2 out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"18 January 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  A Life Less Ordinary is a nice little movie that is quickly becomming a cult film along with the other MacGregor\/Boyle collaborations.
