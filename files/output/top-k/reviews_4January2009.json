A very apparent passion project for him, DeVito stars as the father to the titular Matilda, the story's narrator, (which is a bit confusing since the father neglecting her is also the one telling the audience about what she is doing, but it's just the same voice, not the same character), and is the film's director, making sure his vision comes across. I'll admit to never having read a Dahl book, but I do generally enjoy the films made from them, (except the Burton Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). This one is no exception, as the heightened reality is played just tongue-in-cheek enough to stay cute while also having an edge of danger and eccentricity. Kids should love this little girl with powers and intellect, punishing her parents, and adults will enjoy the absurdity and fantastical elements, reminding them of a time when stories and fun ruled the day.Who better to portray this savant's white trash, crooked parents than the unique pairing of real-life husband and wife team DeVito and Rhea Perlman? The two of them exude sleaze throughout, always trying to make their daughter into a true Wormwood, one who doesn't waste her time in books when she can get all the information she needs, quicker, by watching television. I mean, who would rather read Great Expectations when you can watch the Million Dollar Sticky game show? DeVito excels in roles like this, just put a salesman moustache on him and he's the conman stereotype you know and love, putting stolen car parts (how great are the packages wrapped in the shape of the part they are?) into cheap shells and making 200% profit. And Perlman is transformed into a shrill gaudy looking woman, so confident that her wardrobe and appearance are beautiful that the fact she looks like a ten-cent prostitute is even more entertaining. Her whiny voice and ability to laugh at her husband is priceless; I'd have gone to the library to Xerox adoption papers, just in case, as well if they were my guardians.As far as the story goes, what at first just appears to be a hyper-reality&#151;bright colors mixed with drab and dull sets, a precocious six-year-old making breakfast and going to the library herself to learn, and a very black and white delineation between good and evil&#151;becomes so much more in the second half. Eventually Matilda learns that she has telekinetic powers; she can move things with her mind. This aspect brings the tale into even more of a fantasy world, but it works in spades, especially with the introduction of a new villain besides her parents, Agatha Trunchbull. This taskmaster of a school principal will not allow the children to learn anything creative. She is unafraid to throw a child into the next town with her super-strength, nor to berate anyone who crosses her path. With a revelatory relationship between this witch and Matilda's favorite teacher Miss Honey, the young girl does what she can to save her classmates from the abuse and intellectual prison they are being educated in.This trio of actresses is at the core of the film's success. The always radiant Embeth Davidtz plays Miss Honey as a woman who wants change, going behind the back of her boss to attempt at teaching the children something good and wholesome, to get them to find their creativity. Very much a child herself, enjoying the simple things in life and just as afraid of Trunchbull as the children, her calm, shy demeanor is a perfect sidekick to Matilda's strong-willed older-than-her-years heroine. As far as Agatha Trunchbull goes, Pam Ferris is absolutely perfect. A DeVito favorite, (she is also in the classic Death to Smoochy), Ferris is witch incarnate. Possibly having killed her brother to take his mansion, she has oppressed her niece, kept everything sweet and nice for herself, and became a strong-woman with immense throwing ability. A formidable foe indeed, her scowl and heavy-hitting footsteps as she runs through her house trying to capture an intruder are so over-the-top that they work.The true star, though, besides some great art direction, is young Matilda herself, Mara Wilson. Yes, that cute little girl with the lisp from Mrs. Doubtfire is the heroine of the film. Able to handle the appearance of a six-year-old while also acting like someone so much older, Wilson embodies the character three-dimensionally. The facial reactions when she is thinking what the narrator is telling us are perfect, her smile and sheer joy at helping herself and others, and the girlish voice saying such educated things all make for a role that little kids can watch and aspire to be. Because at the heart of this story is the message that no matter where you come from, no matter what hardships and obstacles stand in your way from being an important contributor to society, you can find a way to succeed. Maybe you shouldn't leave the house to explore the neighborhood at four-years-old or put peroxide in your father's hair-oil, but you get the idea.

This is exactly how I would describe THE 5,000 FINGERS OF DR. T. While the film suffers from being too long and at times too slow, it is so visually arresting that it's still worth seeing...at least once.The movie is a fantasy written by Dr. Seuss (Theodor Seuss Geisel ) and came out during a time when the writer\/illustrator was not as famous or ubiquitous as he would become later. Because of this, the public was less likely to embrace the film's weirdness and left many in the audience confused--and as a result the film bombed at the box office. I think if such a film came out now that it would do much better as people are more willing and able to embrace weirdness and unconventionality.In addition to writing the script, Seuss also wrote many, many songs for the film--and therein lies some of the problem. While some of them are clever and fun, many of them simply aren't and make the film drag. Cutting several songs might have really helped tighten up the picture and kept the audience's attention--I know it felt like a real chore for me to finish the film.So if the film was slow and had too much music, then why do I say that you should see the film? Well, the look of a Dr. Seuss book is there and in glorious 1950s Technicolor. The look of the books are replicated exceptionally well--with amazing set designs. The bizarre color pallet, stairs and ladders, disembodies hands, hats, costumes, etc. all look like they were pulled straight out of a Seuss book--and you marvel at the care that went into making the film. Despite having lesser-known actors in the roles, it must have been a very expensive film to produce just because of the sets alone.Now the question is who will enjoy the film? For younger kids, the film is occasionally too scary and slow, so I'd never dream of showing it to them. For everyone else, it still might be a chore due to the songs and pacing, but for anyone who is artistically minded or just loves Seuss' books it is a treat.Finally, where can I get one of those wonderful hats?

For younger kids, the film is occasionally too scary and slow, so I'd never dream of showing it to them. For everyone else, it still might be a chore due to the songs and pacing, but for anyone who is artistically minded or just loves Seuss' books it is a treat.Finally, where can I get one of those wonderful hats? There must be some floating around somewhere.

Can enemies work together to insure their survival under the harshest circumstances, or will hate prevail and both men die? It is a very touching story about how friendship is formed out of necessity, and fueled by the human survival instinct.At the end of the film, Marvin and Mifune escape one island and land on another that had been conquered by U.S. soldiers, then abandoned just as quickly in the swift series of battles throughout Pacific islands toward the end of World War II.With supplies left behind on the island, the two men get cleaned up and shaven, and are able to find something to eat and even find sake on which to get drunk.While drunk, Mifune finds a copy of LIFE Magazine which shows Japan losing the war rapidly. Mifune understandably gets upset and angry, then he and Marvin get into a drunken argument.In the theatrical release, bombing can be heard in the background during this argument, and the movie just ends abruptly with an explosion that tragically takes the lives of these enemies-turned-friends. End of story, war is hell, now go home.Luckily, I was watching the 2004 released MGM version DVD, which has the alternate ending that presumably director John Boorman had submitted to the studio as the ending for his film.In this ending, no bombing can be heard in the background. Mifune reads the magazine, gets upset, and the argument takes place. This version, however, contains no convenient explosion to make it seem like both men became enemies again, only to be killed together. The tragedy here happens when both men seem to realize, with dialogue-free fantastic physical acting by two legendary actors, that despite everything they have been through, and despite having becoming friends, their place in this world is not meant to be together. They both exchange sad final glances, and quietly walk off in opposite directions.I like to think that both men returned home to their respective countries, and became actors, who went on to star in movies like The Seven Samurai, and The Dirty Dozen.This alternate ending is a much more complex, more interesting, more ironic, more tragic, and infinitely more satisfying ending than the one that was slapped on the end of the film for the theatrical release. I hope this movie is restored to the better ending, and featured as a Criterion Collection release with commentary from director John Boorman some day soon.

My elementary school years in Florida saw our librarian reading us many of his lusciously detailed books and I fell in love with the paintings as well as the stories. So when I saw that Jumanji had been made into a film, I was very excited. Watching it back in 1995, I think I really had fun, and revisiting it now keeps a lot of that childish enjoyment intact, even if the special effects may not have aged well. Going through the first little bit, a prologue if you will, I was completely in the dark, not remembering any of those moments. It's been even longer since I last read the book, but I want to say that backstory was added for cinematic effect, although I could be totally wrong there. Either way, it is a nice set-up, starting in the 1800's as two young kids bury the game in hopes to rid the world of it, only to be found again by Alan Parrish in 1969, transporting him into the jungle world for 26 years until two new children stumble upon its drumming.Special effects are a very interesting thing. Whenever you get groundbreaking, never been better graphics, they will never hold up with time &#133; well maybe not never. I recall films from my childhood that were so vividly magical, yet when I revisit them now I can hardly understand what I could have been thinking. Stop-motion animation or blue-screen work that is a different tint or animatronic creatures feeling plastic, if it's fake it will look fake when you become accustomed to newer technology. This is true with Jumanji, but being a children's fantasy it doesn't hurt the replay value. Sure the backgrounds start to look flat, telestrating that an effect will be coming because you know there is a blue-screen behind the actor, and interaction with computer elements becomes forced as the humans don't quite match up when touching the objects not really there, but it still works. The lion is quite effective, the set-piece water and quick growing vines portray some realism, and really the only things that may be a touch off are the monkeys, (very cartoon-like), the stampeding animals, (definitely not in the same color scheme of environment with what they run through), the jelly-like plastic spiders, and the quicksand floors. Otherwise, you kind of give it the benefit of the doubt because I truly believe the story holds up strong and you will be engrossed in the plot progression, hiding the inadequacies of effects.The film is an inventive tale about a game that affects the real world. You role the dice and bring creatures from Jumanji into your own living room. It's a dark magic that rears its ugly head first by entrapping a young boy until the next player rolls a five or eight. His disappearance so frightens his friend, however, that she runs off and seeks psychiatric help over the next three decades to prove to her that it never happened. As a result, young Alan Parrish grows up in the jungle world of violence and fantasy, only to be brought back as a grown man when the new inhabitants of his now-deceased parent's house roll the dice themselves. Judy and Peter start to understand what is happening, and unlike Alan and Sarah, they read the second half of the instructions which state that only when the game is won and the word Jumanji spoken do the fantastical elements entered into their world go away. While it might not be real, it is all very much alive and solid until the game takes it back again at the end.The cast resides in the tale very nicely, containing many familiar faces and effective turns. Alan, the boy trapped and returned, is played as an adult by the always fun Robin Williams. It's a somewhat more subdued role for him, yet the knowledge of all these creatures and having first-hand lived in Jumanji, allows for a little of his manic mannerisms to show up. But I think his relationship with the adult Sarah, played by Bonnie Hunt, works best. The two of them are very much still children&#151;one had been trapped in a fictional world and the other in her own head. Only now, so many years later, do they finally have a chance to grow up&#151;and with a very intriguing and somewhat surprising ending, they get to do so in more ways than you may think.There are also some nice small supporting roles, including Bebe Neuwirth as the present-day children's, (Judy and Peter), aunt; Jonathan Hyde as Alan's father and fictional villain Van Pelt, who is very much an embodiment of the father; and David Alan Grier as Soulman Carl Bentley. Grier is a lot of fun playing someone from Alan's past that becomes a policeman, with his new job putting him right in the mix of things in the present. The two roles that really make the film work, however, are the new game players played by Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Both are great as two youngsters who are battling their own fears about what is happening while also trying to be the adult figures to Alan and Sarah, keeping them on task to finish the game they started and hopefully bring their world back to normal.

It is a vastly superior film to Nemesis (No. 10) or First Contact (no. 8). Even The Undiscovered Country doesn't hold up well.The plot, as we all know, is that Kirk must return to the Genesis Planet and retrieve Spock's body to reunite it with his katra, now unfortunately and comically trapped in the head of Dr. McCoy. The crew decides to steal the slated to be decommissioned USS Enterprise, and have a showdown with the Klingons.So, why does this movie work? Well, first, there is the fact that the minor characters get a chance to shine in the absence of Spock. Scotty, Sulu, Uhura, Chechov, all get to do some fun things and have some character development.Secondly, there is Christopher Lloyd as Kruge. Yes, he's the first in a long line of Trek movie villains trying to top Ricardo Montalban's turn as Khan in the second movie. Granted. He's wonderfully over the top.Third, the Destruction of the Enterprise.

The first time I saw it, I thought it was utterly brilliant. The second time? Utterly brilliant. One of the few films that remains just as excellent on rewatch and possibly even gets better.I'm shocked and disconcerted to hear it's considered by some to be one of the worst classic Disney films. If this movie is an really an example of Disney when it's being half-assed, then I wish it would half-ass its movies more often, because the result of their supposed insouciance is a wonderful, delightful, and perfect movie, an extremely charming, fun, and well-written interpretation of Robin Hood.I think one thing that seems to throw some people off about it is that it's not like any Disney movie that came before it. To me, that's part of what makes it so fantastic. Many of the jokes and scenes are ones I wouldn't expect to see from a Disney movie, and it seemed like this was the first Disney movie that wasn't afraid of taking a few risks with its characters, jokes, tone, structure, et cetera. And the risks they took with comedy stand the test of time; the jokes in this movie are not dated or forced in the slightest.The lack of an overarching plot was another thing I love about the movie. It all flowed very well and sucked me into the world of Nottingham, as the narrative depicted a time period in the lives of the denizens. Instead of offering a formulaic, beginning-middle-end type of plot, it offered several episodes of different events in Nottingham, each intriguing and engaging.These episodes also balanced each other out quite well in tone; we got to see both the carefree, down-to-earth moments and the darker plights of all the characters, making the whole movie feel very well-rounded and very real. It wasn't as if the movie portrayed everything in black-and-white. There were shades of happiness in the sadness, and it was great to see the characters sometimes be able to forget about their struggles for the time being and just live in the moment. The happy moments made me feel happy and free, and the sadder moments touched me. The emotion was handled in a very rare way it was subtle and understated, executed perfectly, not overdone, not forced, and not unconvincing.While this lighthearted yet dark, exciting, and yet down-to-earth tone and the sporadic structure were two things I really love about the movie, I think its strongest point lies in its characters. They were not cookie-cut-outs of their traditional roles and were subtly multifaceted. Robin Hood himself was not exactly a perfect Prince Charming, but yet was much more charming than any of the heroes that preceded him (and most of those who were his successors). He was engaging in every scene he was featured; he was funny, compassionate and selfless, intelligent and clever, jovial and fun despite his mission of great somberness, and is easily one of the most likable and quite admirable Disney heroes.Maid Marian could have been typical in her role, but instead she still came off as quite unique, as she carried with her none of the usual melodrama and overreactions of most Disney female characters; she was instead genuinely lighthearted, caring, and kind-hearted, a perfect match for Robin Hood. Little John, while not shown as often as I'd like, served as a perfect foil for Robin Hood in the scenes he did have, was just a very entertaining character overall, and really was the one to save Robin Hood from Prince John...he was an overlooked hero, for sure, and his friendship with Robin was endearing.Of course, Prince John and Hiss were hilarious. John's combination of being utterly insane, pathetic, spoiled, and at times just plain stupid made for an extremely funny and interesting character, and Hiss was a perfect counterpart for him. All the other characters--from the family of bunnies to Lady Cluck to the singing rooster to Friar Tuck to the sheriff--each had a discriminating personality all their own and all contributed something worthwhile to the film. It was definitely an ensemble film, completed with a greatly diversified and captivating ensemble of characters that play off each other wonderfully.So, the only flaw I find in it is the one that's already been mentioned on here several times the reused animation and choreography. That's not a major detriment at all though, and I really couldn't care less about it when the overall package of the movie was so spectacular. This movie just oozes with great spirit, camaraderie, fun, charm and delivers the very true and relevant message of the power of unity, hope, and love for one's fellow man in times of hardship. It's a pure joy to watch, my favorite Disney movie, and one of my favorite movies of all-time.

When a beautiful woman turns up on his doorstep seeking signatures for a petition to the US Government to support the rebels in a small South American country, Fielding falls for her immediately. They date for a while but ultimately Nancy is put off by his lack of passion for political suffering and breaks it off with him. As part of his rebound, Fielding heads to the military dictatorship of San Marcos and manages to find himself embedded amongst the rebels as they prepare to storm the capital from the mountains.Watching some modern Woody Allen films put me in the mood to go back to the start and watch some of his earlier films that I hadn't seen for ages or had never seen. Bananas was one of these as I don't think I had ever seen it but I had heard good things about it as it is considered one of those captured by the phrase earlier, funnier films. Loving Love & Death and other of his films from this period, I had no reason to suspect it would not be as good as others have said, but sadly it is not. The plot is a doozey of an idea and offers so much but it is only here and there that Allen's script manages to hit this target. Outside of thee moments a lot of it is more hit and miss and a lot more sporadic in terms of the type of humour it is.

First of all this is unique movie, since it's a romantic comedy with supernatural case as well. And what a supernatural it is  reading the mind of the women (the dream of all the men!). The movie's first 2 thirds are super; everything looked masterful, hitting the mark brilliantly. But the third act wasn't the same at all. From the moment of the unexplained matter of losing the superpower till the laconic end is nothing but a dismal, especially when all the good funny memorable characters that we saw before got no chance at all to have a final statement or a reasonable end or anything equals their earlier nice noisiness. (Josh Goldsmith & Cathy Yuspa)'s fantasy factor wasn't built on solid ground or even got its own fantastic logic, which's something you'll going to witness again and clearly at their next project (13 Going on 30 - 2004). The storyline of (Marisa Tomei) was trivial and just for assuring how the lead's character, by his lie about himself as a gay, will go straight in his new relationship. It didn't also give us the great chance to see how the man's man would do when he got faired at the end, or how he would work under the authority of his woman lover; a never done anticlimax. Obviously we have a very smart script as a criminal here, which mistreated the third act. Though  this is one enjoyable movie, got the esprit, rhythm, and the glamour of Sinatra's songs (something not existent in any of today's movies), it even managed somehow to be a very rare superhero movie where the main idea is so cinematic and not based on a comic. (Nancy Meyers) handled the job of directing so fine, I think it got something to do with the fact that she's a screenplay writer herself. She knows the good script when she sees it, still in love with the intelligent determined working women like her movies as a writer (Private Benjamin, Jumpin' Jack Flash, I Love Trouble), and she's capable as a director of transforming the witness into image, performance, and lovely pace. Look at the movie's smooth status like a dream, no, it is a dream comes true. It has some amusing moments that all the elements succeeded in giving it a tasty flavor  the scenes of the lead alone in his apartment (talking, dancing, waxing !) there is so serene sense about them, the photomontage of the daughter trying to select the right dress with (Christina Aguilera) singing What a Girl Wants, the shot of (Gibson) standing in the face of fate asking to take his gift back; that was the top of them all summarizing the movie's distinctive talents and its magical personality in general. (Mel Gibson) looks great in his very late first romantic comedy (or his first pure comedy without action), the 44-year-old star used all of his real gifts to dazzle us with some brilliant performance that I didn't expect it to be as very good as this. He owns the role as if he is Nick Marshall in his real life ! (Helen Hunt) is a mine of live emotions, she can deliver at least 10 different reactions in one scene so simply, also her vocal performance was perfectly sharp, confidence, and sentimental exactly like her character. The writing mastered all the scenes that got a mind reading to be one of the movie's treasures. The too many characters made such a wonderful world around with fancy details. I loved the basic wicked idea of it where the man is just intimidated by the woman's intelligence. The message of a more sensitive man, or a more feminine one was well put, where the whole thing is about how he must Listen carefully, yet not in a deceitful or manipulative way. Actually (What Women Want) has the rare ability to attract men and women equally, believe it or not my most male-fanatic male friends love it so much !! It will live long as a classic example for a highly entertaining meaningful movie that we wouldn't have many of it along the years, a solid romantic comedy where there is some analyzing for its 2 main characters, and as a movie where everything is great except its third third !

What he doesn't know is that the woman is mentally unstable and soon she begins to stalk him. Needless to say, this here predates Fatal Attraction but unlike that film this one here was made on a pretty low budget. Considering the budget the film turned out a lot better than it could have, although I'll stop short of calling this a masterpiece, which is something a few critics seem to think. While this is extremely well made I can't help but feel there are a few major flaws with one being how dumb the main character is. There are countless times this whole thing could have been avoided yet Eastwood's character does something dumb to keep it going. There's another logical issue with the woman getting released somewhere that happens a bit too easy but even with these problems the film still works on many levels. The suspense level is something Eastwood seems to be playing with a lot during the movie. He never really builds up suspense but instead just throws it at the viewer out of no where. He doesn't let it build up or grow but instead it just jumps out at the viewer just like the female character is constantly jumping out of various places. A lot of the film's success is due to Walter who does a terrific job in her role. There are times that she's so incredibly chilling that you can't help but really think she has a few mental problems of her own. Walter handles all of her scenes very well and comes off quite chilling, which is the most important thing. Eastwood's role is an interesting one as he doesn't play a tough guy but instead just a normal one. He pulls this off pretty well, although I had somewhat of an issue at the end of the film as to how easy he's able to be pushed around.

On the other hand, if you are like me and enjoy watching all types of movies from low budget yet entertaining disasters to box office hits than you would probably enjoy this movie.I love Tim Curry as Vladikov. He is a great actor and always does extremely funny roles.I love this movie.It was extremely cheesy but it is so entertaining. When ever I want a good laugh this is one of the films I watch.

It is no small achievement that the movie takes stiff real-life dialogue and even some lame 'true' jokes and by sheer screen presence and charisma of its stars again makes all of it sparkle, not to mention the traumatic scenes in space of the crippled spacecraft as it wobbles its way back to Earth. It is fair to say 'Apollo 13' makes its story much more exciting than it seemed in real life, which somehow just doesn't seem right, but which feels like an unimportant thing to worry about while you're watching it. Part of this success I think is due to the fact that most of us really DON'T (or didn't) know the whole story of what happened on this space flight. I know I was shocked to realize just how badly the spacecraft was damaged in the initial explosion; one whole side was ripped away. Given what the astronauts and NASA had to work with at the time in terms of technology, and witnessing as we have even greater tragedies since with the space shuttle, it really is nothing less than a miracle the three men made it back to Earth safely. Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon are all fine as the astronauts; each gets to be heroic at various points in the film though there is subtle stereotyping Hanks as Commander Jim Lovell is level-headed, compassionate, almost too good to be true (the film is based on Lovell's book); Paxton's Fred Haise is quite ill during much of the flight and puts up a brave front but, well, he's no Lovell; and Bacon portrays Jack Swigert, who garners nearly everyone's resentment as a hotshot young pilot, a last-minute replacement for the more respected Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise). Back on the ground in Mission Control, Ed Harris is wonderful to watch as Flight Director Gene Kranz, and 'director' is a good description of his role- he orchestrates the rescue effort, cool, determined, confident. The scenes in space are quite convincing, many of them shot in weightlessness, and convey believably the crisis which faced the crew and their counterparts on Earth. I didn't realize how good a film 'Apollo 13' was until I watched it the other night for the first time in about five years. It is an uncommon example of Hollywood telling a 'true story' and getting it right.
