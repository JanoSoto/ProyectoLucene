Hard to believe it's been practically a decade since The Blair Witch Project was all the buzz, revolting some with how it would not give in allowing us to see what is terrorizing these three unfortunate would-be documentarian filmmakers, causing some audience-goers to almost up-chuck at the dizzying, skakey camera work(..but, if you think about it, this only gives this piece merit, these are amateur filmmakers who have yet to truly master the right form of precise camera-movement), and leaving many furiously duped at how producers claimed it was real, that footage of vanished film students had been found and pieced together for our benefit. Watching it for the first time since, hell, 2000 I guess, I was surprised at how this gave me the creeps. It was as if I were with them, deep into the woods lost, the sinister trappings of wilderness imprisoning me. I envisioned just what it would be like, there in that tent hearing noises out in the distance, even those giggly sounds of children brought chills up and down my spine..particularly when you see and hear the slight pounding on the exterior of the tent. I mean, snapping twigs and sticks out in the darkness actually gave me the willies. At first, I could understand how three film students, Heather, Josh, & Michael would find their little adventure such a thrill..it was like a vacation with the goal of capturing a documentary for an extra grade in school lifting their average of say B- to possibly a B+. This documentary, as seen early on, seems to be little more than to photograph and convey the legend of some Witch who supposedly haunts the woods. It's treated with rolled eyes as locals share what they know second-hand about it, providing our students with fuel for later laughter. I enjoyed how, as this continues, the camaraderie deteriorates eventually leading to shouting matches and ridicule. I found this actually rather believable and realistic, it worked for me. I could see a couple of people I either barely know, or know just from reputation, getting lost with yours truly as the guide with these sort of reactionary emotions and situations happening. These are just people with everyday jobs hoping for brighter futures facing unforeseen horrors which spiral out of their control despite the fact that getting lost in the woods in our modern age shouldn't happen. Is it some mythical witch behind the spooky noises and unusually shaped rocks and stick-men? The film sure paints a picture of this in the final moments as Heather and Michael enter an eerie dilapidated house with children's hand-prints and ritualistic symbols inscribed on the walls as Josh cries for their help. The basement with a person standing with their face to the wall as a camera falls helpless to the ground after a hard thud sure opens up the scary idea that something truly disturbing was happening away from the camera. I like not knowing because I could just imagine the horrors taking place as if it were me being treated to a rude awakening that far from the civilization I know lies in the heart of the wilderness evil has freedom over those unlucky enough to enter it's domain. I know that a lot of f-king people hate this with an absolute passion, but this sure worked for me..I mean just think about it for a minutelost in the woods, sounds and voices in the distance, you have heard about a supposed witch haunting the woods, one amongst your party is kidnapped with his agony just out of reach echoing the wilderness, and rocks(..not to mention something bloody wrapped in a napkin, neatly intertwined within sticks, cloth & string)formed in a specific manner warning you that you are not alone.

If John Doe's sin was the envy, the only sin that remained was the wrath, but I don't think that this had anything to do with the detective's wife.

But those humans have done considerable progress in all fields, especially Robotics.Storyline This is a movie about a robot child adopted by a couple whose only son is suffering from some grave illness and is placed in a cryogenic chamber in a comatose situation. There are almost no hopes of him being recovered and hence the couple decides to adopt a artificially intelligent (possessing a self learning processor) robot child called 'David'. Initially he is just a robot coming to grasps with his new surroundings, his new family. But then as time passes on he starts adapting himself to the humans. Then one day the comatose son of the family recovers suddenly and then he has to share the love of his parents with David, the robot. But then the human child, under pangs of jealousy, mistreats David till his mother decides to have David disassembled and hence takes along with her to the manufacturers. But the 'mother' factor in her does not have the heart to do that and so she leaves him mid-way in a jungle. Here David meets a Robot who works as a Gigolo and has run away from the world. And then this movie is the saga of their adventure together as they travel.Acting Perhaps the most mesmerizing in the world considering it comes from a child - Osment(Sixth sense, The(1999)) as the Robot. No, wrong ... Let me rephrase it. OSMENT 'IS' THE SELF-LEARNING, ADAPTING, TRANSFORMING ROBOT.Undoubtledly best by any child in movie-history considering the demands\/complexities of the role. Jude Law's performance is ON PAR with Osment's but he is shown to us as the already adapted robot so no more major transformations in personality here.Connor's performance of the heart-broken mother made me speechless.What NOT to expect If you are a fan expecting that a sci-fi movie ONLY means black leather, Ray-Bans, bullets, guns, explosions, ruthless man-killing robots and mind-boggling action scenes, this is not the movie for you. Sorry, but ordinary life situations in a realistic sci-fi movie do not demand fireworks. (I do love the Terminator \/ The Matrix series but they are a LOT futuristic and contain Time warping events.) 'AI' is a LOT PRACTICAL and talks of only practical near-future life of any ordinary human being \/ Robot.What to Expect Mind-boggling performances and even more Stunning Visual Effects Extravaganza. A flawless direction and script considering the demands of the movie. Remember, its easy to make a series of totally-out-of-the-world 'Star-Wars' movies but very difficult to create one single practical movie like this. Get Real.This is the Ultimate Masterpiece in cinema history. Simply because it not only required realism\/practicality as a base to the Plot but also Brains and Science. Also the Emotional and Philosophical Factors in this movie will undoubtedly touch any existing living human being who understands English. But the technicalities depicted in this intelligent film (...And I am not talking about the visual\/sound effects of the movie) can be only be grasped (not totally but still...) by those in the engineering fields especially Software(like me), Robotics and Electronics, basically anyone from the field of Artificial Intelligence. This movie is made for people like us. People like us don't care if this movie becomes the Greatest blockbuster of all time or not. Simply because this movie satisfies us.Ironically, this is movie has not been made keeping the ordinary non-technical movie loving public in mind even though it IS concerned with the near-future of all human beings.Perhaps this is the ONLY perfect example of any masterpiece voted down by some people NOT because they did not like it BUT because they did not like it since they did NOT understand it in the first place. It is the various Technical Theories in this masterpiece that some people could not properly interpret and digest. This movie takes itself seriously and correctly so.

'Artificial Intelligence' gets a complete 10 \/ 10.Buy\/ study this movie and Enlighten yourselves.

The filmmakers don't waste a lot of time with unnecessary dialog or a sappy romance. They get right to it and stay on track for almost all of the 82 minutes.Thus, if you like somewhat-hokey 1950s science-fiction movies dealing with space or monsters, or in this case both of them, you should enjoy this little film. Most of it involves trying to cope with a specimen from Venus which quickly grows into a Godzilla-like monster (but smaller).It seems a space ship had gone to Venus, but crashed on the way home. Only good-guy William Hopper, who used to help Perry Mason win courtroom cases on TV about this same time, survives the crash. The ship lands in a big body of water off Italy. The specimen, about the size of a trout, washes onshore where a little boy finds it and then shows it to his scientist-uncle. Within hours, it seems, the thing begins to break out of its ice encasing and - presto! - we have a small little Godzilla. Hours later, it's about the size of a small man. Very soon it's several times the size of a man.Here's the good and bad news on the special-effects, which are crucial to a film like this. With Hall of Fame FX man Ray Harryhausen, you know you're going to get the best of what you can expect from a film 50 years ago. Compared to most films of its ilk during the '50s, this is good stuff and the creature looks and moves in a pretty realistic manner. The only goof is that in some scenes, such as the one in the barn, the monster looks about three feet high in some shots, and 20 feet in others. The scale gets thrown out of whack a few times and then several times later in the film. Thus, you never really know how big this lizard-creature is. Overall, however, it's still done extremely well for its time period. There is a scene, too, where the alien creature fights an elephant! Once again, for something 50 years old, they did an excellent job re-creating what that fight might look like. It was well done....and how often do you see a monster fighting an elephant?? Pretty cool stuff. By the way, I watched the colorized version and the monster was green.The acting is passable, too. Hopper, as Col. Robert Calder, knows what's he doing, as do most others in here. Some of the actors are familiar faces from '50s and '60s television. The female interest - which is played down - has Joan Taylor as Marisa Leonardo. She's a bit bland but not bad-looking. She reminded me of Phyllis Coates, from the first season of The Adventures Of Superman.All in all, if you're looking for a campy and fun, along with fast-moving classic-era sci-fi flick, this is highly recommended. You won't be bored.

The characters, plot, and feel of the movie leave you wishing for more at the end, and most of its flaws are minor and easily overlooked in light of the movie as a whole.The story picks off where the first movie left, only about ten years later. Rick and Evie are married, they have a ten year old son, and they have a manor in England which they share with Evie's brother, Jonathan - but of course, their passion is still Egypt and they're off to explore more tombs with their slightly over-inquisitive son. In this case, Evie has been having visions of the past and it's led her to an ancient bracelet. Alex, being the annoying ten year old, puts on the bracelet and is promptly kidnapped along with Evie by a cult dedicated to the destruction of the Scorpion King, a mythical warlord. Of course, in their efforts, they've decided to resurrect Imhotep, the villain of the first film, and use him to kill the Scorpion King to take control of his army of Anubis warriors.Rick and Evie are, of course, not about to let this happen, especially not at the expense of their son, and they go on a long journey across Egypt and Africa to recover him. They realize that Evie's visions are from a past life and that she was the daughter of the Pharoah Seti, Nefertiti, who was the sparring rival of Anck-su-namun, lover of the Pharoah, and also the witness to the murder of the Pharoah. With the help of Ardeth Bay, the Med'jai warrior from the first film, they discover that Rick is also a reborn Med'jai warrior destined to bring about the demise of the Scorpion King.The film has some very high points. Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weisz are excellent actors and have a deep, almost explosive chemistry with each other, and with their on-screen son. Freddie Boath, as Alex, is hilarious, a great fusion of Rick and Evie, figuratively as well as literally. However the one character that I had my eye fixated on was Oded Fehr's Ardeth Bay. Not only is he the first Islamic warrior to be portrayed in a favorable light and leads the first full Islamic army since Lawrence of Arabia that is cast in a good light as well. He's the most emotional (and yet somewhat funny) character, and doesn't cling to the general stereotypes of an Arab that we tend to see in cinema nowadays. Jonathan is hilarious, and we get to see him showcase more than just his humor as he proves his worth in battle. And of course, Arnold Vosloo was fantastic as Imhotep, a villain to (almost) the very end and yet not a one-dimensional monster. His love affair with Anck-su-namun is more completely explored within the film and how it leads his actions is very obviously apparent.Compared to the first film, though, it feels slightly less like it's designed for its time than the first film, which felt distinctly placeable in the 1920s like advertised. The film still feels stuck in that time instead of a decade later during the stirrings of the Second World War. The cult henchmen also felt a bit bloated and disproportionately stupid even for a film where the good guy is near invincible.The references to the first film, far from coming off as cheesy, felt well placed and distinctly funny when it needed to be.Truly a movie worth renting. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 August 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The original Mummy was a good movie, and it's immediate sequel deserves no less commendation.

The cult henchmen also felt a bit bloated and disproportionately stupid even for a film where the good guy is near invincible.The references to the first film, far from coming off as cheesy, felt well placed and distinctly funny when it needed to be.Truly a movie worth renting. 8\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"12 August 2008","score":"10 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" I first saw this film not longer after its initial release some 20 years ago and images and scenes from it have stayed with me ever since, so that it was with considerable anticipation that I re-watched it again recently.

I've lost count of the number of times I've watched this film, and each time I do I always find something new to admire. It gained a lot of publicity at the time of its release thanks to the steamy clinches shared by Hurt and Turner, but there's a lot more to this film than Hollywood erotica.This was Kasdan's first effort as a director and he chose a pair of young and relatively inexperienced leads in William Hurt and Kathleen Turner. They didn't let him down, both delivering eye-catching performances that rank among their best (and if you ever get a chance, catch Tommy Lee Jones in Gothic he pretty much copies Hurt's performance here in much of that film).Hurt plays Ned Racine, a small-time lawyer living a life of quiet desperation, desultorily looking for that one big score that will transport him away from a life that is both stifling and aimless. The problem is that Ned is both lazy and a little sloppy, a fact that femme-fatale Maddie Walker (Turner) relies upon as she effortlessly lures him into a plot to murder her husband (Richard Crenna), a lawyer for the mob whose lifestyle contains all the trappings Racine so fervently desires. Things slowly begin to unravel once the murder is committed though, and Racine (and the audience) almost immediately begins to feel the net closing around him as his police investigator friend doggedly (but reluctantly) narrows the list of suspects down to just one.Kasdan fills the screen with noir images that give his film an unusually rich atmosphere, and it's all played out against a sultry heat wave in the deep South. This atmosphere is further enriched by an insuperable score by John Barry that transmits by turns the languid allure of Walker and the life she offers and Racine's heart-racing delirium, firstly at the plot in which he and Walker are entwined and ultimately as he sees his life spiralling out of his control. Superb stuff.

Earthquake is a 1974 American disaster film that achieved huge box-office success, continuing the disaster film genre of the 1970s where recognizable all-star casts attempt to survive life or death situations. The plot concerns the struggle for survival after a catastrophic earthquake destroys most of the city of Los Angeles, California. Directed by Mark Robson and with a screenplay by George Fox and Mario Puzo, the film starred Charlton Heston, Ava Gardner, George Kennedy, Lorne Greene, Geneviève Bujold, Richard Roundtree, Marjoe Gortner, Barry Sullivan, Lloyd Nolan, Victoria Principal, Monica Lewis and Walter MatthauSUMMARY The film opens on Stewart Graff (Charlton Heston) jogging underneath the Hollywood sign. Back home, as he finishes his workout on a resistance machine, his wife Remy Royce-Graff (Ava Gardner) starts her morning by picking a fight with him. At the peak of their argument, Stewart says to Remy, You'd hardly call this a marriage would you? After he's showered and preparing to leave, Stewart finds Remy unconscious with a bottle of pills nearby. Accustomed to her periodic suicide attempts, Stewart prepares to induce vomiting when a violent tremor shakes the bedroom. Remy bolts out of bed, revealing that she was faking. At the Mulholland Dam, two workers begin a routine inspection of the structure in response to the tremor. One of them is drowned in an elevator shaft, which has filled with water after the quake. In downtown Los Angeles, Sgt. Lou Slade (George Kennedy) and his partner Emilio Chavez (Pedro Armendáriz, Jr.) are in pursuit of a suspect. They chase him out of their jurisdiction, finally crashing into the hedges at Zsa Gabor's house. After an LA County Sheriff yells at Lou for ruining Gabor's hedges, Lou punches him out. When reprimanded, Lou explains to his supervisor that the suspect had stolen the car, been stoned, and then driven over a 6-year old Mexican girl without stopping. To his disgust, he receives a temporary suspension. On his way to work, Stewart visits Denise Marshall (Geneviève Bujold), an actress who is the widow of one of his friends and co-workers. He drops off an autographed football for her son and helps Denise run her lines for a scene she is shooting later that day. A junior staffer, Walter Russell (Kip Niven), at the California Seismological Institute has calculated that Los Angeles will suffer a major earthquake in the next day or two. He frantically tries to reach his superior, Dr. Frank Adams, who is busy placing seismic sensors in the field. Another tremor hits as Adams and his assistant are working in a deep trench and they are buried alive. The scientists at the center argue about whether or not to go public with their prediction of a major quake. The acting supervisor, Dr. Willis Stockle (Barry Sullivan), insists that if they are wrong their funding will be jeopardized. He also argues that the panic such a warning would cause could be worse than the earthquake itself. They agree on a compromise to alert the National Guard and police so that they can at least mobilize to help deal with the fallout. While checking out at a grocery store, Rosa Amici (Victoria Principal) realizes she doesn't have enough money to pay for all her items. Jody Joad (Marjoe Gortner), the seemingly kind store manager, insists that she keep the items and make up the deficit the next time she shops. Later, when he hears that the National Guard reserves are being called up on the radio, Jody leaves the store in the middle of his shift, revealing himself to be part of the reserve army. He goes to his run-down boarding house and changes into his NCO uniform, enduring the abuse and harassment of his bullying house mates who accuse him of being homosexual because he's got pictures of bodybuilders on his wall. Blowing off steam at a bar, Lou orders a double bourbon and ignores all the illegal activity he sees. A drunk (Walter Matthau, credited as Walter Matuschanskayasky) periodically wakes up to toast random people like 'Bobby Riggs'. Daredevil motorcyclist Miles Quade (Richard Roundtree) arrives with his partner Sal Amici (Gabriel Dell) and his sister Rosa. A pool shark collects $50 that Miles owes him, leaving him short for the propane tank he needs to do a stunt for a talent scout. Miles convinces Lou to loan him the money by having Rosa reveal a tight-fitting t-shirt he's marketing with his name on it. QUESTION What canceled Denise shoot? Who goes back to Denise's house? Who is in the running for the Company Presidency? Sam and most of his employees are trapped where? Who suffers a severe illness? Who saves Denise and her son? Who was arrested by the Natural Guard for looting? Who commandeers a truck? What does Lou and Stewart pretend to do? Who hears that another aftershock has threatened Wilson Plaza? Where are there survivors trapped? What does the crew use to the trapped people? What gives during a rescue? Who falls into the water? Does this person survive?MY THOUGHTS The only thing different between this picture and The Towering Inferno was that picture was a fire and this was an earthquake. To me this movie was boring after the earthquake because the only drama left was who was going to die and who wasn't. Based on this I give this movie only 5 weasel stars because it just wasn't that interesting.

A Word of WarningThis user comment is for those who have seen the film.You know, I often take away the memorable frightening images when watching this film, but this particular viewing had me focusing on something else..the ending. If you think about it, the entire film until that baffling final scene is one long nightmare. I was trying to wrap my head around it, because it seems we often overlook this very story arc. I always just told myself, that these four teenagers were being stalked by a nightmare slayer, whose perhaps targeting the children of those who burned him alive. But, it's all(supposedly) a scary concoction in the realm of Nancy's(Heather Langenkamp)sleep. I'm not sure if I just woke up from being under a rock or what, but it was something that startled me. Then the ending comes(..from what I understand, this confusing conclusion was set up by Craven as a favor to producer Shaye who was hoping to benefit from a sequel, and boy was rewarded!)and I was once again, as I always am, left with my jaw swinging open. I'll never truly make sense of that final scene, but Craven leaves enough lasting nightmarish images to take away that I'm completely satisfied each time I watch it. The shocking murder of Tina, sliced across the stomach, blood all over the place, dragged up the wall and across the ceiling. Then later, Tina in a body bag(yikes!)calling Nancy's name, later seeing her body, in bag, being drug across the school hallway leaving a blood trail. The invisible hanging of Tina's thuggish beau Rod(Nick Corri)in his jail cell, locked up as the one responsible for what Fred Kreuger did to her. The monumental death scene of Johnny Depp's Glen, pulled into a void in his bed(..television in tow)with a gushing water fall of blood erupting like a geyser throughout the ceiling and room. The imaginative occurrences which terrorize Nancy(..the telephone-tongue gag, the quicksand steps, the bladed glove slowly creeping from between her legs as she lies in her bath tub nearly asleep). Maybe Craven's overall product has flaws which seep through, but he provides so much to make your skin crawl. What playful ground Craven has to operate his ghoulish tricks..the nightmare world provides such freedom to kill innocent teens anyway you wish, as they run for their very lives with nowhere, it seems, to escape. A filthy child murderer who would brings kids to a boiler room to kill..certainly not the hero many would cheer down the road. Interesting, isn't it, that we often forget the evil fiend he really is. Craven gives this psycho free reign to torment and terrorize, the idea is certainly scary if you think about it. And, as far as Nancy, I was doting on the idea that this film is almost entirely(..if not entirely, depending on your opinion with that crazy finale)inside her nightmare, regarding her parents. Interesting that her mom is an oddball drunk and her dad is always gone. They rarely have anything nice to say to each other, and one can sense that this is in the nightmare for Nancy to deal with..a daughter bothered by the separation of her parents and how her mother deals with it through downing alcohol. And, it's always nice to see Freddy before he was the jokey psycho-clown. You rarely ever get a full glimpse of his face, he's the epitome of a prowler in the shadows who is always near yet hard to find..until it's too late, and you are caught in his grip. While I think the Shoulder's Freddy's Revenge has the scariest incarnation of Freddy, he's certainly given moments in Craven's film..such as that one scene where his arms stretch wide as he comes towards Tina, or when he stretches through a wall spying on Nancy. And, the smashing sequence where he elastically stretches from the center of a bed after carrying away Nancy's mom into some sort of abyss, ripping open the sheet from behind his arch nemesis who has seemingly figured out his ultimate weakness..he preys, like many a predator, on the quarry's fears. If one doesn't fear him, then he's vulnerable. Anyway, the film is always a roller coaster ride I hate to get off of..maybe it doesn't scare the hell out of me as it did when I was a kid, but I appreciate and admire the creativity and imagination Craven's supernatural slasher has.

And, the smashing sequence where he elastically stretches from the center of a bed after carrying away Nancy's mom into some sort of abyss, ripping open the sheet from behind his arch nemesis who has seemingly figured out his ultimate weakness..he preys, like many a predator, on the quarry's fears. If one doesn't fear him, then he's vulnerable. Anyway, the film is always a roller coaster ride I hate to get off of..maybe it doesn't scare the hell out of me as it did when I was a kid, but I appreciate and admire the creativity and imagination Craven's supernatural slasher has.

The typical US stereotyped Russian was hilarious with his one-liners, really put the comedy into the film.Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck are their usual best, and Steve Buscemi was great, very funny throughout the film.The film had a good mix of story, comedy, romance, action and was quite sad at times. The film is very entertaining and although it is quite unbelievable, one should remember that it is a Hollywood disaster movie and should not be taken too seriously. Although entertaining, this film will not be watched regularly, it was nearly 10years since I saw this the first and last time and it could be another 10 before I see it again. But I was well entertained and I will be the next time too.

Superb unparalleled Oscar winning Visual \/ sound Effects ... even today. This is Cameron's Best, better than the 'Titanic', in terms of contents. Schwarzenegger's Perfect here because this is the Perfect role him and nobody can match him, the Greatest Action hero of all time ... OK, just behind Jackie Chan \/ Bruce Lee. But in terms of Biggest Blockblusters at least.What to expect An impeccable script, plot, storyline. Revolutionary Mind Blowing Visual\/Sound Effects. Stan Winston (RIP) was a Master at the effects. Terrific Unforgettable Background Scores By Brad Fiedel(True Lies(1994)), an another Master.As far as I have remembered and observed The following were the revolutionary FIRST steps in the various types of Visual effects we enjoy today. Each of these movies had unique first-of-its-kind Visual effects contained in them Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) The Abyss (1989) Terminator 2 Judgment Day (1991) Jurassic Park (1993) Forrest Gump (1994) Titanic (1997) The Matrix (1999) Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace (1999) The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers (2002) The Polar Express (2004)For me, the most realistic, non-Exaggerated, practical, Scientific movie ever made is Steven Spielberg's 'Artificial Intelligence(2001)' which gets a 10\/10 from me. Nobody beats that.In my personal opinion, as a Scientific movie, I rate both Terminator \/ Matrix series as 9\/10,subtracting one star from each, simply because these movies contained some Time\/Place Warping events (Paradoxes) which are a long way to happen even by today's Physics i.e. they are a LITTLE-BIT unbelievable for me considering I did a Major in Physics.
