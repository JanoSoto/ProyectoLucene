So breathtakingly beautiful I even had the stunning colors in my dream last night and that score playing over and over again. As Spielberg said on the DVD A film which is an inspirational to all and I totally concur with that as I, like Spielberg won't to try direction in the future. This is the film that inspired Spielberg to make movies and the likes of Scorsese. So this is one film that no-one should miss. A film of epic proportion and stunning visuals is overwhelming when you watch it. In modern film making it's unlikely that you will see a film so authentic as this. With the introduction of CGI, a film like this would not be made today! I doubt I'll give such a detailed review, as I am still spellbound by the film...still thinking about it's greatness. I will most likely repeat myself, so bear with me. It took 2 years to film this, but you can see the attention to detail in every frame. So well directed and so well put together with stunning visuals, which makes most films you've seen recently look average. If only films were like this now, I would be so much more happy! The screenplay has to be one of the greatest ever written. Every bit of dialogue, you want to hear and when there's no dialogue you are still engaged by the landscape and the spacial awareness of the characters-who so wonderful portray their characters, you can't help but feel part of the film. Each actor's dialogue so brilliantly play off one another...again it's so wonderful to watch. Some outstanding performances from Peter O'Toole, and Omar Schariff, who rightly gained an Academy Award nomination, and Alec Guiness and Anthony Quale. By the end of the film, I didn't realize it was almost 4 hours long, which again shows how much I enjoyed this film. Perhaps it shows the shot attention span of people today as to some negative reviews I've read on here. That annoys me a lot. All I can say to people is this, it shouldn't matter the length of a film! That score has to be one of the greatest I've seen on film. I am still running over in my mind now, so well orchestrated it's unbelievable. Arabia contains some of the most iconic scenes in cinema history from Omar Scharrif's entrance to Lawrence standing on top of the Turkish train with a background of sunlight....it leaves me Wowed. Again that scene with the entrance of Omar Schariff, wow! One of the greatest entrances I've seen. So well photographed and directed, you'll never see such a scene like that again. Superb!

Even, if you haven't saw the movie, you probably heard of it. If you had, saw it. You might agree with me, in scope, that this movie is indeed, one of the greatest films ever made. Based off, Mario Puzo's 1969 novel with the same name, The Godfather tells the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) on his journey, from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss, during the criminal drug wars of the 1940\/early 1950s. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found that a lot of critics, overpraise Marlon Brando's work in this, a way too much. Don't get me wrong, Marlon Brando does deserve, a lot of credit for making his character, the patriarch Vito Corleone, so iconic. I just don't believe, that he deserve, the Oscar for Best Actor, that year. In my opinion, Al Pacino should had be nominated & won. After all, Michael is pretty much, the main character, not Vito. Also, Pacino is the one actor that kept the movie, going, with his great range of emotional. Brando show-what disappears, toward the middle of the film. If any, Brando deserve to win, Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, because Brando's acting is secondary to that of Pacino. It's not personality, it's only business. Besides that, the acting throughout the film was well-performed, from all the actors. I just wish, there wasn't much, many characters. It was so hard to keep track of each one. Some actors, worth noting for their performance are James Caan as Michael's hot-headed brother, Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Irish lawyer, Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Michael's girlfriend, Kay Adams & last, John Cazale as Michael's weaker brother, Fredo Corleone. As much, as I despise, certain gangster films. There was something, likable with these characters. Yes, they do, horrible stuff, but you can't help, feeling bad for them. Indeed, keep your friends close, your enemies closer. Not only was the film had gifted actors, but it was very well-shot. I love, how the film used doors, as a way to symbolize, the different between family life, and 'the family life'. A great example of this, was the last few minutes of the film in which Kay finds out, the truth nature about Michael. It's a crucial theme of the film. The five families are essentially living the American dream with specific ideals that America at the time greatly treasured. One could easily see this as a deconstruction or even an attack on the idea of the American Dream. So it was no surprise that the families met inside a Federal Reserve Bank. Talk about smart! I also like, how the movie has this stark bleak look to it. All the colors in the film, looks so muted, as if to say, this gangster film was indeed shot in early 1940s, technicolor. I like how, clever, the filmmaker was, when using bright colors. Most of the only bright color, used in the film, was orange. It was used as mostly an item, like a fruit symbol. It representing sin, and greed. It's as if it was the forbidden fruit, in the bible. It was also, used as a sexual way to show impending judgment. Everybody that got near it, end up, dying in the film. While, the movie has tons of other symbolism. It's also shroud in darkness and mystery. The movie even has a few film noir inspire scenes, where shadow, become a big factor to show, how shady, the underworld, can be. Vito's daughter's wedding scene shows the best of this. The movie has a lot of violence as well. Scenes like the real horse severed head were pretty gruesome. Still, compare to modern day, gangster movies, the sex, drugs and violence is pretty tame. For the most part, the movie kept to a somewhat classy mode with its subject matter. I do like the editing. The whole baptize sequence was amazing to watch. The pacing for the film is a mixed bag for me. There were some parts of the film that I kinda found boring or out of place, such as the Sicily, Las Vegas & Hollywood scenes. It felt like, I was watching two different films, due to how unfamiliar, each of those scenes, were, when comparing to the New York settling. I just glad, they were very short. The film also drops a lot of the novel's subplots, such as Sonny's mistress, having a large vagina, and having to get surgery on it. Another thing worth cutting is a lot of Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) and Lucy Mancini (Jeannie Linero) scenes. In the novel they both get big story lines nearly the equal of the main storyline with Michael. I'm glad, they cut it out, because it was too jarring. Though one major one, they cut out in this film Don Vito's youth and rise to power came back, as part of the sequel, 1974's the Godfather Part II. Happy, that they found, a way to add that, back in. Leave the Fontane BS. Take the cannoli, instead. The film score by Nino Rota was great. You really think of the word 'mafia' when you hear that tune. While, the film doesn't deliberately speak that word, it did expose, what was then, a mostly hidden underworld of Mafia organizations. Overall While, some big time criminals and even some stars, like Frank Sinatra were against it, and boycott the film, but they couldn't stop the movie, from being made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release. It's a classic.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"8 September 2015","score":"","review":" I used to watch this tons as a kid, and for me it's this and Puppet Master 2 that tie as my favourite 'killer little creatures' flicks. It's still hugely enjoyable and charming to me and I love it a whole lot to this day. It doesn't take itself too seriously, the deaths range from ridiculous to downright chilling, it's scary and funny when it's trying to be, and even poignant once or twice. I love the music score which somehow brings a little added depth all on its own, surprising that it wasn't done by Richard Band. I enjoy all the classic grotesquerie of a good old-fashioned spookhouse that's rendered deadly for real in some way, that's always a very welcome theme to me. And when the little terrors finally do escape into the carnival at large and briefly cause some real havoc it's just the grisly icing on the cake! When the tilt-a-whirl goes flying off its axis into fiery destruction, that's such a childhood amusement park nightmare come to life! Some of the characters are interesting enough, I like the little drama of alcoholic old Uncle Ned, very well played by the late Royal Dano as a burned-out old fool who mistakingly believes to his cost that it was he who summoned up the Ghoulies. And I absolutely love Phil Fondacaro, it may be an old line, but he had such a big presence for such a small person, and he more than held his own despite putting up with indignities like being picked up and made to wear a stupid gorilla costume. And while I'm sure a lot of films like this back in the day arguably took their basic elements of the idea from Gremlins, so what? I think as far as this sequel goes at least, the Ghoulies are way more frightening than the Gremlins, their particular brand of hijinx are downright vicious! All I'm saying is, if you're gonna take your inspiration from somewhere, at least take it from somewhere worthwhile, and I think there's more than enough different stuff in this movie for it to respectfully distance itself and be much more than just a worthless copy. This does get such an undue amount of criticism dumped on it, it is far from ideal but it's no flaming garbage can like Troll 2 either - good bad picture though that is! And I personally don't think the creature models are bad either. The faces of at least two of them are amazingly expressive. I have a theory that at least some of the people that hate this movie have only ever seen the inferior MGM DVD cut, which until very recently, had been the only version widely available, so I decided to include this list of everything that's included on the UK VHS.. 1 The scene of Patty's death is a bit of a complicated one as both the VHS and DVD have seconds that the other doesn't, but they always leave out when she has a bite taken out of her face and when the cat Ghoulie slashes her. 2 Now this is an odd one. Apparently at the time in Britain, all film scenes involving ninja paraphernalia no matter how mild, had to be removed completely by the thrice-cursed BBFC!! Thus, although it's present on the DVD, Ghoulies 2's rather strange shuriken scene is sadly absent from the VHS cut. 3 During Merle's death it shows slightly more of the buildup to his pendulum slicing, but it still omits the juiciest part.

I guess it explains how she so deftly climbs the big wheel at the end, but it adds nothing and is a terrible scene all around. 6 In the DVD when the poor clown falls into the dunk tank and has his arm bitten off it cuts to this really s****y model of the aquatic Ghoulie that looks completely out of place, but in the true version it shows the little devil with its mouth full of blood and the mangled arm close by - damn scary scene! 7 And finally when P.Hardin takes his faithful trip to the can, before it cuts to his echoing scream, we get to hear a few more choice ripping sounds as the last remaining Ghoulie chomps down on god knows what! Those cuts are mostly mere seconds long, but the absence of the much needed bloodshed really does take the edge off and makes the movie a lot more weaker than it was originally meant to be.

First, you have the first one which I thought it was a classic. Second, you have the sequel where different directors have their own cut of the movie as Lester's cut did fine, but I much prefer Donner's cut. Now, we have the third movie that had just made this franchise go way overboard. I'm not happy with the direction for what this movie went, because like I said it is painful to watch. Here is my take on it The movie centers mostly on Gus Gorman, who is nothing more but a bum as he looks for a job by working as a programmer on computers; while that is going on, CEO of the computer company, Ross Webster hires him to do on what he is being told but Superman foils his plan. So they try to make Kryptonite to kill Superman, but instead of that, his personalities has now change. On the other hand, Clark Kent returns to Smallville for a high school reunion with one of his best friends Lana Lang. So, that is what the movie is about. This plot for the third movie isn't as interesting as you thought it would. Heck, I didn't think it was that interesting either. This movie is not only having its camp factors like Lester's cut of Superman II, but having put too much comedy in it. There is nothing wrong for putting comedy in a superhero movie, but all jokes that were putted in the movie are being forced; its just trying too hard to make something on what is suppose to be funny. None of the jokes ever worked. I hated the opening scene, where instead of the tradition opening credits like the other Superman movies, they just show the city of Metropolis for becoming a madhouse as well as having the credits for making it look like the opening text crawl from the Star Wars movies. Richard Pryor is not funny in this movie, and doesn't belong here to be in this movie. I've read the movie's trivia on IMDb, where Pryor read the script and thought it was terrible, but agreed to do it for paycheck. I'll forgive Pryor for his involvement, but if he wants to be in this movie then have him play a villain or something, instead of being a comedic sidekick. The villains in this movie are uninspiring, because they couldn't used any villains from the comics but just have to be created for the movie. I honestly don't care for Ken Thorne's music or some of Giorgio Moroder's music that he created for the movie, which I find them nothing to be appealing. The acting is so-so for the cast, except for Christopher Reeve, Annette O'Toole and a small appearance from Margot Kidder. Margot Kidder's look for Lois Lane is okay, but miss the way she look in the first one and the second one in Donner's cut. Her acting is still good, but wish that she had more screen time. As for Annette O'Toole, her performance as Lana Lang is well done, but I don't find her chemistry with Christopher Reeve well enough as much as I enjoy the chemistry between Reeve and Kidder. Now for Christopher Reeve, he is still giving a great performance for playing Clark Kent and Superman, and there is nothing to dislike about him. I love him when he becomes corrupted by a fake Kryptonite as he turns to the dark side; he seems to have a blast for this role for playing such a bad superhero. I do like where evil Superman fights his ego Clark Kent as its pretty much a fight between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. As Clark Kent finishes off his evil self, I love when the Superman theme comes in as he is now fully redeem, while he opens up his shirt by revealing his costume and fixed the damage that he caused. That is where I get the feel of that I'm watching a Superman movie, until it goes back to being painful. The child actor who plays Lana Lang's son Ricky is really annoying aside from Pryor's character. Even his acting is very wooden. The special effects are similar to Lester's cut of Superman II as there are parts that are good and bad. Lester's direction is terrible, and you still wish if the Salkinds have not fired Richard Donner for making Superman II as if this franchise would still be strong. This is not an easy movie to sit through, because at least when you have some bad movies like either Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, X-Men Origins Wolverine, or X-Men The Last Stand; there are at least not as painful as Superman III. Although, I do thought the third X-Men movie is okay, but still not good. I'm sure you're going to disagree with me on one of those movies, but that just me being bias about something. This movie sure does feel like Pryor's movie than Superman's, because Pryor really steals the show. This movie should have more scenes with Superman, than having more scenes with Pryor in it. I don't like Superman III, and I strongly don't recommend it. I give it a 3 out of 10.

It tells about a man remembering his youth in a small town where he and his three friends, all of them twelve and about to embark on different schools, decide to crown their last summer together by taking a trip down the railroad tracks in pursuit of a rumour about a dead body seen by the river. A sight that naturally appeals to the horror freaks in prepubescent boys.It is a quintessential Stephen King story in that the basic premise isn't all that complicated, a couple of lads walking down the tracks, but is filled with insight, purpose and life by the smallest of details given to his characters. I've rarely encountered more interesting, yet so believable characters than I have in his books. He's the one author that has made me realize that every single man or woman alive is interesting beyond belief if you only get to know him or her well enough.Unfortunately the novella is so bountiful and full of details that the movie seems pale by comparison. Most of the important plot points are referenced and acted out, but they don't reach the same emotional impact because details are missing and\/or not given enough time to sink in. In addition the film suffers somewhat from the fact that all the main actors are children. They're very good child actors, Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix especially, but you can definitely see through their acting in most scenes.Nevertheless, it's an excellent movie to check out, even if you've read the original novella. It speaks about childhood through very unconventional means, but it rings no less true because of it. Quite the opposite. We really never have friends like the ones we had when we were twelve.

In the first 20 minutes, we instantly understand our protagonist's primary interests and ambitions Gene (her son) and music. These two things carry her forthwith throughout the film, music especially, even when the odds gradually go against her. Dancer In The Dark is a story of betrayal and injustice, themes that were explored in Trier's previous film Breaking The Waves. Selma's viscera manifests in her determination to sacrifice for what she loves, namely her son, so much show that she was willing to sacrifice her own life to ensure that the congenital eye disease that will inevitably effect her son will be cured with the money she saved. Despite the atrocities our protagonist witnesses, she maintains a sense of elation through her affinity with music. Riddled throughout the film are elaborate dance scenes which play out like musical dance numbers. Unfortunately, the songs aren't great and are tedious. They abruptly get in the way of the scenes that are taking place. The dance numbers and songs end up being the film's weakest point, excluding the song before 107 steps (which unfortunately is not on the official soundtrack for the film), in which our protagonists finds peace in singing to the sound of hymns coming from a church. This scene, aside from the last scene, is possibly the most powerful scene in the entire film. The jerky camera that is experienced for a great deal of the film is kept extremely still, and the audience is allowed to see our protagonist's emotional ascent from sorrow to euphoria. I can't say this for all the songs unfortunately. Like my aforesaid remarks, they are tedious and feel like left overs from Björk's debut record. Despite my gripes with the song, they do serve another purpose other than just killing time. As the atrocities of the film only worsen, the audience, like Selma, are just longing for the next musical dance number to appear to escape from the trauma, and thus these songs are effectively used as a comforting tool to distract the audience from remembering that even more atrocities await. This applies to Björk's character as well--a mere distraction. While acknowledging this, these songs last way too long and aren't enjoyable enough to justify their length. Speaking of the camera, the cinematography is consistently good despite the camera that jerks around on more than one occasion. It's not as bad as a Michael Bay film, however the awkward editing (which is most likely an artistic decision on Von Trier's part) becomes distracting at points. All the performances are generally well done, namely Björk's and Catherine Deneuve's. However, these actors don't shine until the latter half of the film. In the first 20 minutes, the jagged editing are especially present and Björk scolding Gene was especially laughable, however this is redeemed by her fantastic performance for the last 40-50 minutes or so. The final scene is a grotesque and agonizing scene, as the audience suffers as much as our protagonist. We see our beloved protagonist struggle for survival, find peace, and then meet their inevitable doom. This film may not live up to Von Trier's other masterpieces (Riget\/Kingdom, Breaking The Waves, and Europa come to mind.) However, this film remains as a powerful naturalistic drama. This film isn't hard to like, alas it is hard to love.Rating 7.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 September 2015","score":"","review":" Lars Von Trier's Dancer In The Dark is set in an isolated working class milieu, where we follow Selma (Björk), a Czech immigrant who's eye sight gradually deteriorates throughout the film.
