Shawn Hatosy stars as Timothy Dunphy, a likable, not-very-bright high school student who, like many of his generation, would much rather party than study and would rather smoke-out than think seriously about his future plans for college or career or even life in general.  When he crashes his vehicle, packed with other drinking and pot-smoking teenagers, right smack into the rear of a parked police car, Tim is sent by his working class father to finish his last school year at a nearby prep academy.  Alec Baldwin, adopting a dese-dem-dose accent for the occasion, plays Tim's father, a well-intentioned widower whose brusque demeanor hides a filial love that Tim is only vaguely aware exists.`Outside Providence' certainly does not bring a whole lot of fresh insights to this well-worn territory.  We have the obligatory scenes of non-stop pot smoking (this being a depiction of 1970's adolescence after all), the inevitable first love between the hero and the sweetest, most understanding and, of course, most beautiful girl from the local distaff school, and the predictable confrontations that develop between the freethinking teen and the anachronistic stuffed shirts of the school's administration.  There is also, of course, the mandatory death of one of the members of the original gang to act as a device to sober the boy's up to an awakened awareness of the seriousness and responsibilities of adulthood.Yet, for all of its adherence to the formula of this particular genre, `Outside Providence' wins the audience over, partly through the breezy likeability of the actors and performers, partly through the unforced realism of the screenplay, and partly through the film's dead-on accurate recreation of a decade that is fast becoming the era of choice for modern day nostalgia.

John Kobal's survey amongst 81 film critics in 1988 saw Robert Benayoun and Krzysztof Zanussi vote this one in as the 57th greatest film of all time.Rebel Without A Cause sees a cocky, less-controlled performance from Dean, and, while being perhaps the weaker of the two, is yet somehow more entertaining.That leaves Giant. A sprawling, three hour plus tale of fueding Texan landowners, it casts Dean in his final role as a villain who earns a fortune after land he is left in a will turns into an oil field. The fact that Dean's character is more likeable than the aggressive, boastful Jordan Benedict portrayed by Hudson deflects the focus of the film, as does the fact that it deals more with the Hudson-Taylor domesticity rather than any clear narrative pull. A catch-all coda dealing with racism is un-neatly tagged on the end, cementing the idea that this is a film about anything, everything, and nothing in particular, a great deal of which could have profited by seeing the cutting-room floor.Dean's salary had notably increased from the $12,000 and $12,500 of his first two major films to a pay of $22,500, a generous fee at that time. This was, however, still notably short of the $175,000 and $100,000 paid to his co-stars, Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson respectively. A harsh shoot for the actor, disliked by almost all crew members except for Taylor, his resentment towards the stern director caused him to display his displeasure by urinating in public places, including the set. So driven was the Kubrick-like George Stevens that he shot over 600,000 feet of film, with less than 5% making it to the finished product. In fact, the record states that the petulant Dean gave Stevens a ride in his new car to celebrate the end of filming, dropping him off with the words now that it's all over, we don't have to bug each other anymore. Giant is certainly pacy, despite it's three-hour plus running time. Hudson and Taylor meet, fall in love and get married, all within the first twenty minutes. And it is kind of fun seeing the posthumously-outed Hudson feigning interest in Liz. Production, save for a few driving scenes using film backdrops, is fine, as is the direction and the mammoth sets. Of particular note is ambitious sense of scale when Dean's Jett Rink first discovers the oil, massive plumes of the stuff spurting into the sky with great cinematic effect. Incidental music is of the period, overblown, and more suited to an MGM cartoon than a serious dramatic movie.Most importantly, it lacks focus. There's hints that Dean's underwritten, but decently played, Jett Rink has affections for Liz's Leslie Benedict - and that the feeling is mutual. However, this is never resolved and so we lose out on what could have given Jordan realistic motivation to hate Rink. It's interesting how the treacherous oil baron has his initials &#150; J.R. &#150; presented everywhere. Wouldn't have influenced a certain Dallas by any chance, would it? Also of note is the fact that we never learn exactly why the film's called Giant in the first place, unless it refers to Hudson's formidable 6'6 frame.

Will she leave him? Is he too bourgeoise to make love to her? Is he drunk? Will he wake up tomorrow and find he has been transformed into a giant cockroach? Or failing that, Saddam Hussein? Why does Jean Paul Belmondo look like a frog whose had an anvil dropped on it's head? We are destined not to know the answers to these questions as Marie goes off to find impersonal, masculine sex with Rocco Stiffready, I mean Siffredi. Rocco is a hardcore porn star who has decided to extend his range by playing the part of Paolo. In the buff. Marie gets things off to a flying start by telling him she despises men. Has Tom Cruise entered the room? (I've got a million of 'em, son). She was lying on the bed and just saw the top of someone's head, so it was an easy mistake to make. Maybe it was Toulouse Lautrec looking for a paint brush (naked, Toulouse? Give me a break).Anyway, our Marie gives laughing boy the shove and is accosted in the street outside by a young man who is feeling hungry and offers her ten francs for a sexual service, which being a liberated, modern women she immediately accepts. This he proceeds to do on the stairs to her apartment block, considerately leaving a gap for people to squeeze by. Suddenly the young man turns her round and proceeds to probe for a tooth pick in an unlikely place. Then he leaves without paying. So he was British. I'm not ashamed! she cries. No, she is a women. She is whatever she is. She is...SHE. Marie believes that when a man has sex with her, he honours her. But has she forgotten that the French have something called 'crime passionalle'? If a man has a mistress and his wife objects, then he can kill her and walk free. What a great system, I'm moving to France! No, it's blockaded again. Who is it this time, golf caddies?Meanwhile, Marie's headmaster at the school she teaches at is giving her the eye. He takes her home and smugly tells her he's slept with a thousand women. How does he manage it when he doesn't stop talking? This plot turn must have the teacher's union in hysterics. Where does he find the time? Does he mark homework during sex? Or are all the school kids at Calais too? Anyway, our smoothy, long in the tooth headmaster proceeds to tie our heroine up. Is he going to show her a French film? But this is too liberated for her, and she tells him she is frightened and trapped. I haven't felt like that since seeing 'Jean De Florette'.So has Catherine Breillat single handedly taken French cinema into a new golden age of exploration and inclusiveness? Has she illuminated the sensual inner world of the modern women and brought us to a startling conclusion about the inexplicable aching sadness within? Has she answered the universal mystery of why when you get on the Paris Metro you always end up exactly the same place you started from with half an hour of your life wasted?Non.

Many in the film industry do not like his books and especially don't like the clichéd way the stories develop. Fans of his books, however, want the exact same excellence, in the film.So it goes with The Rainmaker. If you didn't like the book, odds are you enjoyed the movie, if you never read the book, odds are you found it a refreshing underrated film, if you were a huge fan of the book, seeing a condensed version of it, put you off severely.As a rule, I avoid reading a book before seeing a movie based on it. They are two separate things. If one can separate the book from a movie that went over the usual 120 minute formula as it was, you can see this film for what it is, refreshing, unique, and hardly as clichéd as any other lawyer story or movie.What makes this one tick so well? Fleshed out characters other than the lead, different levels of supporting characters, some that help hold up the story, some that help hold up the main character, and some that could be considered incidental. Then there is the lack of court clichés. There is no rambling speech, not by the main character, the evil opponent, or the judge. No speech. Perhaps because the seamless narration of the story provides a nice subtle speech throughout the film. Everytime the story seems on the edge of the predictable court drama twist, it surprises.Our hero, Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon), has absolutely no idea what he is doing. He chose the law because he idolized the civil rights lawyers who stood up for what was right. A shame that isn't the law he is pursuing. Instead, he is the part of the law lampooned the most, ambulance chasers, suing someone for a bloody nose, a broken arm, hot coffee spilled on one's legs ... you get the drift. Rudy loves the law. It is apparent from the beginning of the film, the law does not love Rudy. His main case, a leukemia patient who did not get a bone marrow transplant because his insurance company, Great Benefits, had the gall to deny his claim eight times, call the patient's mother stupid, stupid, stupid, and call the treatment, an experimental procedure in open court. As a result, the patient eventually dies and Rudy, the lone lawyer in his firm, takes on Leo F. Drummond (Jon Voight) and his band of merry stuffed shirts for the insurance company. Rudy is outgunned and he knows it. His partner in his firm, Deck Schifflet (Danny DeVito), knowledgeable about the law, but has failed the bar five times and has just as much court experience as Rudy ... zero. Rudy also gets distracted with an abused young wife named Kelly Riker (Claire Danes). His attraction to the girl and how her abused past mirrors that of his mother and himself, reveals little insights into Rudy that we will not see in the courtroom.It is the realness of Rudy and Deck, their imperfections, the fact that they are obviously fallible, that makes the movie so refreshing. Drummond too is an enigma; He is merely the lawyer, not a member of the company. There is no specific reason to hate him, he is good at what he does, he overpowers Rudy mainly based on the law and experience, not on money and power. It is never even clear where Drummond's false sincerity begins and ends in his dealing with Rudy. By making Drummond the opponent, it gives the viewers a rare treat. Drummond is doing his job, he is doing it well, and is a rarity in court films, a worthy opponent, who could realistically, crush our hero like a bug. Kelly also has more than one dimension. Being abused does not make her whiny, co-dependant, and unable to think on her own two feet, and make crucial decisions. She is a rarity as the damsel in distress, when it really counts, she is as strong as her hero.Then it goes without saying the acting is also done in a subtle and successful manner. DeVito especially is superb with his delicate balance of humor as the ambulance chasing Deck. In the middle of an important deposition, Coppola's script relieves the tension by showing us Deck preying on a boy with a broken arm for his business. DeVito may be best known for his over the top character in Taxi, an obvious little troll with few redeeming qualities. Contrast Deck, also a troll with few redeeming qualities, but with great subtleness, it is those qualities that shine through and Deck is anything but over the top. It shows DeVito's amazing skill and control and should have earned him an Oscar nomination. Voight, plays once again, the villain, but unlike his pandering and embarrassing role in Anaconda, with a hear through accent, and little effort, as Drummond, he becomes the role. You forget the actor is not really a southern little worm. Danes, also does a strong job. But it is the actors in the smaller, more thankless roles, like Mary Kay Place, as the victim's mother, Mickey Rourke, as Deck and Rudy's former sleazy employer, and especially an uncredited Danny Glover, as the judge, who bring color and extra depth to characters that could have easily been cookie cutter clichés when Coppola found the need to par down the book's plot.Coppola took a rare, unique, and stylish gem by Grisham, one so different from his other books it was either deemed an overwhelming success or failure, in comparison to his other work, and did a good job trimming the fat, without trimming the dimensions of the book's most crucial characters. He takes out what won't work with his vision, without taking out who the characters are.Something about this movie just works in all the necessary places. While it is not a movie of the year, it is a solid film. All films have perceived imperfections by the viewers and critics, and this one is no exception. It, however, does not have major missteps in any important part of the film. The acting is practically flawless, the direction is practically flawless, and the writing, is amazingly, for a court film, incredibly absent of major flaws.It is certainly worth the less than four dollars it would take to judge for yourself.

The most entertaining (in a camp way) is Wag the Dog, perhaps the most intelligent Vanya on 42nd St and the most interesting Branagh's Midwinter's Night. The most financially successful is Shakespeare in Love.This is not a sex farce, nor about love. That's all just grist for motion. Here we have a message from the puppets, underscored by pleasant framing of the film by puppets. What the writers of this work have done is suggest that the life of any play comes from the lives of the actors. This is in contrast to plays written by genius playwrights like Ibsen, that are merely performed. For this troupe to have to participate in such an enterprise is seen as hell.Thus we have their (thinly distilled) lives appear on the stage. Along the way we have an audience that is purely incidental since they don't know what's good anyway. We have the theater owner who likewise is ignorant, but married to a failed thespian who suspects. We have the all-important critic whose real interesting characteristic is not his flamboyant gayness, but his views on art he values writing, values the fulfillment of the author's intent. So he is particularly vulnerable to being abused. The character is a parody of Wilde who came down strongly on this controversy.We have the vain celebrity (Sarandon) who does not have the commitment to the art of acting. She briefly tempts our author who really in his heart loves and respects the actors, here represented by the head of the troupe. Sarandon has a speech where she claims she loves the art, but it is clear she loves herself only. Is she a parody on Ellen Terry? Walkin and Sarandon clearly as actors believe in the supremacy of the actor, so in playing the bad guys they overly ham it up so that we know where they really stand. In so doing, they undercut their purported honor somewhat. Rather unsettling, especially so since they are amusing at it.And we also have the troupe itself. They do double duty here first showing honest commitment. Second providing the material that appears in the play, each representing a distinct stereotype. Wheels turn, people love and not, die and not. This strange crew (and any like it) we are told is worth it despite the strangeness. Along the way many writers are quoted from the Greeks through Chekhov. This is not new stuff, as noted above, but once you know what it is about it is well enough done. However, there is only so much reward one can get, the work can only go but so deep when it is turned over to actors. See where I stand?If you come looking for a sex farce where the theater is incidental, your mistake will lead you to disappointment as it clearly did many who commented before me.

This is in contrast to plays written by genius playwrights like Ibsen, that are merely performed. For this troupe to have to participate in such an enterprise is seen as hell.Thus we have their (thinly distilled) lives appear on the stage. Along the way we have an audience that is purely incidental since they don't know what's good anyway. We have the theater owner who likewise is ignorant, but married to a failed thespian who suspects. We have the all-important critic whose real interesting characteristic is not his flamboyant gayness, but his views on art he values writing, values the fulfillment of the author's intent. So he is particularly vulnerable to being abused. The character is a parody of Wilde who came down strongly on this controversy.We have the vain celebrity (Sarandon) who does not have the commitment to the art of acting. She briefly tempts our author who really in his heart loves and respects the actors, here represented by the head of the troupe. Sarandon has a speech where she claims she loves the art, but it is clear she loves herself only. Is she a parody on Ellen Terry? Walkin and Sarandon clearly as actors believe in the supremacy of the actor, so in playing the bad guys they overly ham it up so that we know where they really stand. In so doing, they undercut their purported honor somewhat. Rather unsettling, especially so since they are amusing at it.And we also have the troupe itself. They do double duty here first showing honest commitment. Second providing the material that appears in the play, each representing a distinct stereotype. Wheels turn, people love and not, die and not. This strange crew (and any like it) we are told is worth it despite the strangeness. Along the way many writers are quoted from the Greeks through Chekhov. This is not new stuff, as noted above, but once you know what it is about it is well enough done. However, there is only so much reward one can get, the work can only go but so deep when it is turned over to actors.

The most entertaining (in a camp way) is Wag the Dog, perhaps the most intelligent Vanya on 42nd St and the most interesting Branagh's Midwinter's Night. The most financially successful is Shakespeare in Love.This is not a sex farce, nor about love. That's all just grist for motion.

This is the first real Godzilla film I've got to see on the big screen, but I hope it's not my last.

It's a shame, because this was more entertaining than a lot of the films I've seen this summer.I really hope this does well, and I encourage everyone to see it.

I stood in line in the clear, pleasantly cool autumn evening. The event was the premiere of Supergirl. A year before, fans were disappointed when Christopher Reeve announced Superman III would be his last. So it was with some anticipation that fans went to watch the latest Super film from the Salkinds and Pierre Spengler, the men who had brought us three enjoyable if uneven Superman movies in '78, '81 and '83. That was my mistake.I shouldn't have gone in as a fan of the Superman movies. This was a whole different animal. There were similarities, to be sure, but mostly with Superman III. Faye Dunaway's Selena is an megalomaniacal archvillain of the same (hammy) school as Robert Vaughn's Ross Webster in III. Both harness formidable forces beyond their ken that eventually slip their control and turn on them. Both make for decent popcorn movies if you sit back, relax and don't think too much.The opening titles were somewhat of a letdown after the gold standard set by the original Superman movie. But the titles had been going downhill anyway. II's was not as good as The Movie's. Supergirl's was still better than III's eye-straining theatrical titles and IV's peerlessly cheesy, cartoonish titles.Jerry Goldsmith's score didn't appeal to me at first. Again, it was the Superman mindset. How could anything hope to compare with John Williams' masterwork in the first movie? As the years passed, I grew to like this score as I learned to judge it on its own merits, just as with the movie itself.Much has been said about Dunaway's over-the-top performance as Selena. Still, Mia Farrow's thankfully brief appearance as Kara's mother was worse, filled with breathy, weepy pronouncements. Compared with his role in Breaking Away, Hart Bochner had more lines but a weaker performance.In terms of scenery, this held its own. The rocky coast of the Scottish Highlands, made famous by Braveheart, stood in for the shores of Lake Michigan. Better technology made Supergirl's twilight and nighttime flying scenes over Chicago brighter and sharper than those in Superman, although with apologies to Chicagoans, the Windy City's skyline is not as breathtaking as the Big Apple's. The Midvale School is surprisingly convincing as an American campus, since it was all filmed in England's Pinewood Studio. The same could be said for Midvale itself, an All American small town that only existed for a few weeks on a British studio lot.David Odell's screenplay is best left uncritiqued. Once you start getting into the numerous and large plot holes, there's pretty much no stopping.Now Anchor Bay Entertainment has issued a limited edition DVD featuring both the International Cut and a Director's Cut. The International Cut was available on Japanese video at the time of the US theatrical release and was partially blamed for its poor box office. After 16 years, it was good to see this in its original Panavision aspect ratio - a welcome improvement as the movie suffered badly in pan & scan.Interestingly, neither cut is 100% complete. Director Jeannot Szwarc seems to have mellowed in his old age, as evidenced by some changes in the Director's Cut. A common swear word was dubbed with a G-rated shoot and Lucy calling a vicious Myra retarded was replaced with a politically correct rotten. Removed were a dig at the door-to-door proselytizing of Jehovah's Witnesses and a moment when Nigel calls Selena a bitch. All unchanged on the International Cut.The extras were a mixed bag. The Making of featurette was rather boring, as they usually tend to be. The audio commentary with Szwarc is dull and tedious, filled with banal or obvious observations, repetitive opinions, vague answers, frequent misunderstandings and awkward pauses.

This movie was custom made for the Oscars, and although it did not take away the awards it would have liked to, two best picture nominations for Darabont's first two directorial efforts ain't bad at all. Maybe it doesn't break any new ground when compared to some of the more outstanding achievements of &#145;99, but that doesn't matter. It's a movie, made for those of us who enjoy going to the movies, packed full of high drama, a decent helping of suspense, and some generally moving sequences. It also finds a way to slip in a message in what has to be one of the most gruesome deaths I've ever seen in a movie, but at the same time it manages to not be preachy. it's not hard to see that this movie is probably against the death penalty, but I think it treats the subject in a fair and even-handed way. I think this movie will have made a Hollywood heavy-hitter out of Frank Darabont, and it couldn't have happened to a more worthy guy. It's also unfair that he has taken criticism for doing two Stephen King novel adaptions in a row, and both having focused around a prison. Besides the obvious similarities, the two films are completely different, and I wouldn't mind if he made a career out of adapting King\/prison movies if they were all as good as Shawshank and the Mile.Let's start with Hanks. Y'know, ten years ago I would never have guessed that Tom would be the huge player that he is now, nor that he would be suited for such roles as diverse as a grizzled army captain in WWII, an unfortunate, gentle AIDS victim, a lovable mentally challenged ping-pong champion or the executioner of death row inmates in a Louisiana penitentiary. Times, they have a-changed, my friends. Doesn't mean I rush to the theatres to see the latest Hanks film, some are better than others, but he deserves a lot of respect for rising to the top of the heap in Hollywood dramatic pictures. I like him. Who doesn't? Other actors of note were David Morse (he never disappoints, but I'd like to see more of him in leading roles.

Michael Clarke Duncan does a good job as the enormous, simple and gifted man, but I wasn't sure it was Oscar worthy. I often wonder how hard it really is to play a mentally challenged person, since it seems every year at the Oscars there are always a few nominees for playing the part. He just seemed a little too sweet to me, but that may be the fault of the writers, but the award did go to Michael Caine for what was considered by many to be a terrible movie, so what do I know? My only complaint would have to be the length of it all. I really feel that is could have used a few cuts to speed it up a bit, but that's about it. The first time I watched it I was constantly comparing it to The Shawshank Redemption in my mind (a superior film, in my opinion), so I was a little disappointed, but that was unfair of me.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"4 September 2000","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  The Green Mile is one of those movies for people who love movies. It's a combination of a terrific cast, a hot director, great script, likeable characters, and Tom Hanks, whom the term likeable seems to have been invented for. This movie was custom made for the Oscars, and although it did not take away the awards it would have liked to, two best picture nominations for Darabont's first two directorial efforts ain't bad at all. Maybe it doesn't break any new ground when compared to some of the more outstanding achievements of &#145;99, but that doesn't matter. It's a movie, made for those of us who enjoy going to the movies, packed full of high drama, a decent helping of suspense, and some generally moving sequences. It also finds a way to slip in a message in what has to be one of the most gruesome deaths I've ever seen in a movie, but at the same time it manages to not be preachy. it's not hard to see that this movie is probably against the death penalty, but I think it treats the subject in a fair and even-handed way. I think this movie will have made a Hollywood heavy-hitter out of Frank Darabont, and it couldn't have happened to a more worthy guy. It's also unfair that he has taken criticism for doing two Stephen King novel adaptions in a row, and both having focused around a prison. Besides the obvious similarities, the two films are completely different, and I wouldn't mind if he made a career out of adapting King\/prison movies if they were all as good as Shawshank and the Mile.Let's start with Hanks. Y'know, ten years ago I would never have guessed that Tom would be the huge player that he is now, nor that he would be suited for such roles as diverse as a grizzled army captain in WWII, an unfortunate, gentle AIDS victim, a lovable mentally challenged ping-pong champion or the executioner of death row inmates in a Louisiana penitentiary. Times, they have a-changed, my friends. Doesn't mean I rush to the theatres to see the latest Hanks film, some are better than others, but he deserves a lot of respect for rising to the top of the heap in Hollywood dramatic pictures. I like him. Who doesn't? Other actors of note were David Morse (he never disappoints, but I'd like to see more of him in leading roles. Remember The Crossing Guard, anyone?), and Sam Rockwell, who must be a rising star because he steals every scene he's in in this one. Wild Bill is one sick puppy, but I'll be dammed if he isn't a riot to watch as he torments the guards on the green mile. Other actors I enjoy are Gary Senise, James Cromwell and Barry Pepper. All are good, but they aren't given much to do so they don't leave a lasting impression. Michael Clarke Duncan does a good job as the enormous, simple and gifted man, but I wasn't sure it was Oscar worthy. I often wonder how hard it really is to play a mentally challenged person, since it seems every year at the Oscars there are always a few nominees for playing the part. He just seemed a little too sweet to me, but that may be the fault of the writers, but the award did go to Michael Caine for what was considered by many to be a terrible movie, so what do I know? My only complaint would have to be the length of it all. I really feel that is could have used a few cuts to speed it up a bit, but that's about it. The first time I watched it I was constantly comparing it to The Shawshank Redemption in my mind (a superior film, in my opinion), so I was a little disappointed, but that was unfair of me.

What makes it special is that it shows a family with little or no parental support struggling to hold together by the fortitude of its siblings.  It is a special film in two other ways characters act out their roles within unstaged, real world settings and, at the same time, the characters are shown, mostly in isolation, responding to these same settings.  By doing so, the film highlights even more the chaotic, transitory, and even aimless behaviors of urban life. We see the mother, Eileen (Kika Markham) relieving her frustrations by playing in an actual bingo hall, the estranged father, Tim (Stuart Townsend) taking his son Jack (Peter Marfleet) to a wildly contested soccer match, an emotionally wounded woman, Nadia (Gina McKee) riding a double-decker bus filled with revelers, and the piece-de-resistance of one of the pregnant characters, Molly (Molly Parker) giving live birth.  The film even uses fast forwarding frames in two scenes, one involving Nadia and her lonely-hearts club failures and the other when the dishonest husband James cannot return home to his wife, to illustrate their out of control,  misdirected lives. Another treat of this film is that we don't initially know the identity of the characters and their connection to each other until the film slowly unfolds bits and  pieces of their story. While that might tax the patience of some people, I became much more alert to the story.  What was annoying was the overemphasis on the background nightlife of London and the heavy dramatic score, a score that seemed to tip off in at least two places that the film was prematurely ending. Overall,  Wonderland is a well-acted, worthwhile film because it successfully portrays real-life situations involving real-life struggles in a unusually candid and poignant way.

The bad news is that the dark and bizarre imagery was at best distracting and at worst detracting.Julie Taymor's imagery was somewhere between nightmarish and hallucinogenic.  It was typical of a style I call Noir Bizarre, where dark themes are augmented by weird and disjointed images, replete with gruesome scenes and morbid undertones.  Tim Burton's work is illustrative of this style.  Taymor conjures a surreal version of ancient Rome with contrived retro\/futuristic costumes, and modern period props such as motorcycles, automatic weapons and arcade games interspersed with horse drawn chariots and swords.  Tamora's (Jessica Lange's) costumes were particularly outlandish.It is invariably mentioned by the directors that make these Shakespearean updates that they provide an opportunity to bring Shakespeare to a new generation.  They hope that adulterating his work by repackaging it with pop culture imagery will somehow make it more appealing to the masses.  The irony is that just about all of them have been abysmal commercial failures.  As soon as the masses discover that the Old English verse has been preserved, they steer clear.  The only people who ultimately see these films are the people who liked Shakespeare in the first place, and they generally resent the visual perversion.Despite my disdain for Taymor's strangely fantastic vision, the film was effective mostly due to the superlative acting of Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming, and Harry Lennix.  Hopkins' sophisticated and wieldy presence provided a dominating force that bolstered the entire cast.  Jessica Lange was maniacal as the evil seductress intent on revenge upon Titus and his family for the death of her son.  Harry Lennix gave an absolutely demonic performance of Aaron, the malevolent moor whose only repentance was for the good deeds he had done in his life.  Alan Cumming was also excellent as the sniveling Emperor being manipulated like a puppet by powerful forces on all sides.In the final analysis, the peculiarity of Taymor's vision distorted but did not negate the excellence of the acting and the power of the play.  I rated it a 7\/10.  I recommend that Shakespeare lovers not be driven away by the avant-garde presentation and allow themselves the opportunity to enjoy the awesome performance of a terrific cast.

However I was stunned how serious this film brought the comic to life. There also were many quotes and moments that become even better, if you know the comic. I don't think it is a good idea to make movies out of comic books but this time and with one or two Tim Burton movies, too, it worked very well. Anna Paquin, Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are absolute convincing, justifying every modification made on the character. Even ruce Davison was great and let no doubt about the sincerity of his action occur. The only thing that bothered me a little was that - at least in the german dubbed version of the film - small touch of arrogant right hand put onto Cyclops but here, too, I think fans of the comic book now better. Although he always said to be no fan of the comic, Bryan Singer seemed to have made a film full of love for the material making that over the top characters like Magneto or Sabretooth appear serious and true. X-Men stands way above the usual superhero flicks in character and plot development but also doesn't try to look more real through cutting superpowers to a more realistic level. And for the visual expressiveness, seeing someone carrying a tray with glasses of champaign in Wolverine's dream or Professor Xavier graciously standing up from a chair inside Kelly's memories are just two little details of many, where the action movie grows to be art. I surely can't wait to see Beast or Gambit in action but for a sequel it would also be an idea to concentrate more on the characters that are standing on the side line in the first movie like Storm or Cyclops. After all X-Men is a great piece of film, fun to watch and almost flawless in portraying some of the greatest comic heroes of all times and lets recent superhero flicks like Batman & Robin look even more hollow than they already are. I hope, their will be more films like X-Men in the future but I also hope, that Marvel understands that there is a big difference between the movies and the comic books and don't repeat the mistake of letting a film change an already existing comic like they did with Blade.

I really think that it is better than Stanley Kubrick's version, and that's saying a lot, considering I am a big fan of his. Anyway, I think that this was more fast paced and detailed than the original. Dominique Swain was perfect as the nymphet, and Jeremy Irons was wonderful as Humbert Humbert. I do however feel that there were certain scenes from the first film that they should have put into this one. For instance, there should have been more scenes between Jeremy's character and Melanie's character, and they should have shown the conversation that Humbert has with Quilty at the hotel. On a personal level, I was awakened to something. Seeing this made me realize how similar I was to Dolores in my youth. Not that I ever had an affair with a man old enough to be my father (I would never have done that!), but closely watching it I began to realize that my mentality and personality were actually quite similar to hers. There were many scenes where I thought, Sounds like me when I was that age. It was a truly eye opening experience. Also, I too noticed that the director, Adrian Lyne, focused on Dominique's feet frequently. I think this was supposed to be something sensual. And I was a bit perplexed by the ending. Why did they have Dolores, aka Lolita, die in the epilogue? In the original Humbert was said to have died awaiting trial, but I don't believe they ever mentioned Lo dying too. Was this the way it was written in the book? I would really like to know. I also think that they drew a lot of attention to Lolita's mouth. Some examples being the banana scene, her constantly taking out her retainer, her rolling the jawbreaker around in her pallet, etc. All in all it was a good film.
