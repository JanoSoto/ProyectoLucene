I would almost swear that parts of this film were actually filmed there. Also, I can remember when Fannie Flagg co-hosted a local morning show in Birmingham. I used to watch it every morning while I was getting ready for school. She was also a weather forecaster for our local TV station. She sure came a long way since then.Not much changed in Alabama between the twenties and the time I grew up there, and seeing this movie brought back memories of all those good home-cooked Southern meals. Fried okra, fried green tomatoes, fried squash, and good old Alabama barbecue. Alabama has the best barbecue in the nation.Folks in Alabama take their food seriously, and they also take friendships seriously. I guess that's why it is so easy to read things into Idgey and Ruth's relationship that may not be there. (Lesbianism? In Alabama? In the 20s and 30s? Get real, people!!!) Anyone even suspected of such behavior in Alabama back then would have been unceremoniously lynched. So, let's try not to read too much into Idgie's and Ruth's friendship, huh? Evelyn's and Ninny's friendship is very moving for anyone who has ever had a friend that changed them, that gave them the strength to keep going when all hope seemed to be lost. And I think posters are being a little too hard on her husband. Ed seems like essentially a good man. He just falls into the same trap that most of us men fall into. We allow ourselves to get too caught up in our own little worlds to pay much mind to what makes our wives ache and thrill. (Come on, fellows, we're all guilty of that sometimes. Be honest.) Throughout the movie, Ed shows that he is devoted to his wife, even if he is totally oblivious to what is going on in her life.This movie reminds me of STAND BY ME, because it makes you want to laugh and cry at the same time and it gives you a snapshot of a time and place that is gone forever.

I had never seen the film, but as hearing so much good things about it and my brother literally praising it, it couldn't be that bad, now could it? I decided to watch it when I really had the time for it, the movie lasts for more than 3 and a half hours after all and it is said to be one of the finest movies in the whole history of motion pictures. That is something that really grows up the pressure of the viewer; You just can't start watching it whenever you want to and without having any expectations on it, it's just that simple. Well anyways, I finally looked up a free spot on my calendar and decided the day when I'd watch it. So, I took my time and watched it like a week or two ago and to be honest I was in a pretty good mood too so nothing could go wrong. Well, I am glad to say that even after 48 years, still to this day, Ben-Hur is an entertaining, fine diamond and an excellent motion picture. You really have to relate to the time when it was made, but even without relating it's surprisingly good. Considering its age some of the things occurring in the movie are just mind blowing.The story in its wholeness is outstanding, it has everything an epic movie needs; Adventure, thrill, drama, romance, tragedy, just everything. And this is, indeed, an epic movie among the best. The story itself isn't just what described in the plot outlines; It has so many more levels of incomprehensible depth, so much power which takes it to an unexpected direction and based on what I saw I'd say it's undeniably one of the best epic stories ever seen or told on the big screen. Based on the novel by Lew Wallace, translated to a screenplay by Karl Tunberg it's quality writing and storytelling in an incredible level, from the beginning till the end. The film does get a bit heavy after the 2 and a half hours, which is really disappointing, as until that point it has a very good flow and the viewer doesn't get bored, but after that point it's slightly long-winded. Despite that the movie manages to be highly entertaining, so for the final rating and your overall opinion the heaviness isn't exactly as crucial as you may think. The music composed by Miklós Rózsa creates tension and comprehension while we progress throughout the movie and though it is as much as any other music in the movies made in the late 50's or early 60's it's still pretty awesome and it can not be ignored.The one significant thing above everything else is how well the whole movie is made, especially when considering its age. It's simply phenomenal how much time and effort has been put to this movie and it can definitely be seen from every single scene streaming across the screen, one after another. The props, the dressing, basically everything is an achievement like no other and the numbers just speak for themselves; 100 000 costumes, 8000 assistants, 300 props and the biggest budget at its era. This all, and more, brought the movie 11 Oscars and it was the first movie to win such many of them. No other than two movies have achieved that to this day; Titanic (1997) and The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King (2003). You have to bear in mind that back in 1959 there wasn't any kind of possibility for a such thing as CGI so basically everything you see on the screen has really happened and has been shot, so even that alone is a huge achievement which really deserves all the attention this movie has. There was this one particular scene that I will most certainly remember forever and that was the scene which probably awoke contradictory opinions and views back then because of its bloody yet realistic violence - The horse race scene. That is a scene I think everyone has heard of and I am one of those people who were left mouth open, as it is indeed fantastic. Honestly, I stood up from the sofa and gave a little applause after the scene ended.Judah Ben-Hur and Messala, played by Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd, are very memorable characters and the chemistry between those two legendary actors is unspeakably overwhelming, as if the opposite personalities of the characters would compensate each other, which then forms that chemistry. Stephen Boyd is excellent as Messala, but Charlton Heston is even better as Ben-Hur and the role even brought him an Academy Award for the best actor in a leading role. It is no wonder. Like I've said before when I've reviewed older movies; The acting is totally different from the acting these days. It's a totally different art form of it's own and it just can not be compared to the acting this day. There is that certain extravagance if I may say it, it requires that relating to the age again, but it's still a real treat for your eyes and ears, giving you something different. It's like a fresh summer breeze.Ben-Hur is definitely a movie worth watching, when first making sure you have the time for it, a movie which you can not stop and continue the next day. Though it does get a bit heavy like mentioned, it's still worth it in the end. The heaviness is the only reason why I'm not going to give this motion picture a perfect score. The film includes brilliant role performances, fantastic story and superior art direction, set decoration and costume design.

Minority Report proves when Tom Cruise keeps his out-landish behaviour to him-self why he is probably one of the best actors to come out of the past century. From the surface Minority Report seems to come across as a super futuristic action thriller but once you check it out you come to the realisation that nothing is what it seems as this is a story with a lot of complex human emotion rolled into it with lots of philosophical arguments on both sides which all in shows both sides of the coin and what it feels like for the hunter to become hunted.

Demi Moore is superb in this tale of urban violence against women and family and drug use. Bruce plays a character that I haven't seen him tackle before. He does it in an outstanding manner. Glenne Headley as Demi's close friend and co-worker drops the accent and does new Jersey as it should be done. I really didn't like this story, I was very uncomfortable, but I realize, looking back that it was right on the money. The subject needs to be dissected. Moreover it needs to be taken seriously and not swept under the carpet, as it has in many cases. Stats' read out to be 1-3 women are being abused, or have been in an abusive relationship. Demi shows her mettle, she also shows what it's like to come to the end of a violent union. Glenne, her friend was supportive and a little shaky at times. I can't figure who wouldn't be, but she was also strength for her friend. This was a dark and intense brief, look into what some are living through. I am glad that this was made, it shows the grit that it takes to just make it through the day with someone of that lifestyle. Demi is the type that is really believable in this, there aren't a lot of other actresses that have the ability to reach the emotionally burned-out look and feel that Moore does in this. Willis, was and I can't say enough about his performance as he was just a 'natural' in 'MORTAL'.When you can be close and taste it even just a little it is hard to try and blame someone for using the extreme method to exit a relationship just that way. Although, they have to take responsibility in it, when it's them that started the life together in the first place. There are 'signs' that any person should be aware of before abandoning them self to a relationship commitment. Seek counseling first, or talk with close friends around you and don't ever simply base your longing on an emotional state of being...for sure you'll be sorry in the end. And you will in deed be looking for the fifty ways to leave your lover.

Watching it again recently, I finally understand why I like it more than the usual rubbish that passes for horror nowadays.The Relic is pretty starts off weird with an inexplicable (yet ultimately rewarding) opening scene, then for most of the movie it veers into a police investigation. Very rarely do we get a monster and it all focuses on the characters and their mundane conflicting interests. So there's Lt. D'Augusta and Sgt. Hollingsworth trying to figure out how their case at the docks connects with a museum murder with the same MO and the overall relation to Dr. Margo Greene's story and her entwining connections to the case.The film builds on each character so they're never faceless when in the last 40 minutes, the film rapidly switches gear into a full on monster movie (One of Stan Winston's decent designs before he was shunned in favour of CGI) and people start getting picked off in true horror fashion. Weirdly enough, it never feels like two different movies. The whole film is about conflict (Greene's science vs D'Augusta's superstition, police vs rent-a-cops, heroes vs monster, etc) and the story's narrative integrates itself pretty well into the themes on display.There's a great handle in editing and direction at one point where exhibition opens; D'Augusta and Hollingsworth finally realise they're dealing with more than a serial killer in the sub-basements and sewers, while everyone upstairs is oblivious to what's happening below. The movie for a while just keeps flicking between these scenes leading to a nightmare scenario that lasts the rest of the movie. Strangely though, the editing gets too frantic after this and makes several scenes confusing at times (probably to disguise the monster and the remaining budget...)Yes, there are some bad moments...plot holes get the film going, the CGI is very dated ('expensive then, but easily recreated now' kind of look), the creature seems to pop up everywhere within seconds and the lighting, though realistic, is just too dark to truly appreciate the visuals. Oh and there are several characters who are unlikeable just because they need to justify the body count.It's a decent movie though and one to watch if you want something a bit different rather than the usual stalk-and-slash.

But then the project took another direction, with it's understandable in some ways (and it's a looong story, trust me).

It's not a typical Disney feature like for example Cinderella and Tarzan, but it still is a fresh and enjoyable cartoon. It has more irony and sarcasm and it's nice to see a Disney cartoon that is pure comedy. While the plot is simple, the script is well-written and hilarious. The score from John Debney is most of the time boisterous, but it actually fits the tone of the movie.The characters are likable\/hate-able (here comes something that could be considered as a spoiler) Kuzco and Yzma are both the same kind; self-pity, but still funny. Kronk is one of the funniest characters in the film, the same with the squirrel and Pacha's kids. Pacha's wife is very cute and charming. While Pacha himself is not so funny like the rest of the cast, he's a nice and gentle character that is likable. SPOILERS over. Besides, the voice actors are doing a great job!The animation it self looks more than a Warner Bros cartoon than the regular Disney-style, but it fits the movie.

The location for the film was exactingly placed in a bland hotel in bland Wichita, Kansas, a worthy stand-in metaphor for the nothingness of existence where the great things of life are in very short supply for these two good friends who are impatiently waiting for the fabled company president Dick Fuller to arrive to provide that life saving big sale that would give them new purpose and reason to feel good about themselves again. Who would ever guess that a big order for industrial lubricants could do that? Transferring very intelligent and talky plays to the screen often doesn't work well, but when it does it is magical and deeply involving. It worked so very well here, and intelligently so, as Spacey and DeVito were wonderful playing off each other as salesmen friends so familiar that talk between them was almost like talking to oneself, or at least to one's wife. It was obvious that they loved each other as well as most marrieds do, as much of their dialogue was similar to that of a married couple, and the story's diverse philosophical meanderings that ranged from marketing to religion to love to marriage to character and to, of course, the meaning of life and the real value of shrimp versus cheese ball snacks, were all the more effective due not only to the well crafted script, but also due to the world-weary resignation of the lead characters playing off their near opposite, a wet-behind-the ears, young company research newbie named Bob who was oddly sent with them to the convention. Bob was innocently sincere and mostly good hearted, but at the same time was cocky and smug about things he knew almost nothing about but thought he knew so well. His gently delivered, but harsh and well-earned comeuppance at the end from DeVito's Phil was the one great thing that I knew all along was coming, and I was so glad when it came down hard on this naive, supercilious, and self-righteous member of the fundamental religious right. But sadly, as he dumbly disagreed with his comeuppance details that were so obviously dead on, Bob was not at that time wise enough to know that he had so much more to learn over the years before he could claim possession of any appreciable amount of human character. From this, such familiar feelings were surely evoked in all of us who once happened to be similarly young and naive as Bob is here. And, as it turned out the same way as in much of real life, the big sale was not made. Or.... was it? Truly a philosophical thinking person's film and one to be seen again and again for full value.There was a bit of resolve in what served as an epilogue, as it showed that these three ended up pretty much the same as they began, but somewhat tweaked for the better.

His gently delivered, but harsh and well-earned comeuppance at the end from DeVito's Phil was the one great thing that I knew all along was coming, and I was so glad when it came down hard on this naive, supercilious, and self-righteous member of the fundamental religious right. But sadly, as he dumbly disagreed with his comeuppance details that were so obviously dead on, Bob was not at that time wise enough to know that he had so much more to learn over the years before he could claim possession of any appreciable amount of human character. From this, such familiar feelings were surely evoked in all of us who once happened to be similarly young and naive as Bob is here. And, as it turned out the same way as in much of real life, the big sale was not made. Or.... was it? Truly a philosophical thinking person's film and one to be seen again and again for full value.There was a bit of resolve in what served as an epilogue, as it showed that these three ended up pretty much the same as they began, but somewhat tweaked for the better. Hopefully, like we all do.

I have in no way experienced the plight of the marginalized. I've never known what it's like to be kept below the line that divides those who should be educated and those who should be left in the dark. For that reason I, by no means, have any right to speak for those people. But after watching the 1996 movie Set it Off, I can't understand why no one seemed to get offended at its ignorance about, and exploitation of, the lower class- in particular the struggling black communities of urban areas.Set it Off is about four close-knit women who have all had tough breaks in life. They made the best out of growing up in the projects and became, for the most part, honest, hard-working and self-respecting young women. The story starts off with Francesca, a bank clerk, getting held up and witnessing a violent shoot out that her fear crippled her from possibly preventing. A by the numbers detective named Strode blames her for it, causing her to get fired. The story shifts to its main character Lida, Francesca's friend who is a janitor in an upper-class apartment building, soon learning she has to compromise all of her good traits just to break even in life. To help her little brother get some money for college, she gives in to her shady employer's sexual demands. When her brother is coincidentally mistaken for the bank robber by Strode, he is shot and killed with no apologies.The movie was off to a good start, but I quickly started noticing that its scenes were getting progressively dumber. First off all, Strode seems to be on every case that the L.A.P.D. has to offer. Being that I have heard much praise for this film, I was surprised when more and more coincidences started trying my patience. The movie started feeling like a predictable crowd-pleaser, although it was supposed to be a hard-hitting protest about why the lower class seems to have abandoned.Any high school or college writing class teaches that to evaluate something is to see how closely or effectively it comes to its intended mark. My problem with Set it Off is that it is unclear as to what its mark really is. It shakily walks the line between action movie and socially-conscious drama so much that I started to question how dumb does the screenwriter thought his audience was. Since there is an objective made early on in the script, that there must be a reckoning for the unfair treatment of these women (and the lower-class community at large), it is questionable when it starts to stray.In his three and a half star (out of four) review of the film, Roger Ebert calls it observant and well-informed. Sure the film had some very relatable characters and situations, but the screenplay is far from Observant and well-informed. If anything, the writing is histrionic. A realistic screenplay would have characters who were less heroic and aware of their exploitation. Sure Queen Latifah is fabulous as a gun-toting lesbian, but does such a character really represent underprivileged women? A competent screenplay also wouldn't rely on coincidences and action sequences to make its point.(1 and 1\/2 out of 4) ","genre":null},{"date":"28 August 2007","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I've never lived in the projects.

The difference more aliens, better cast and better technology (using forklifts to kill aliens is awesome).I have to give a shout-out to Carrie Henn, who played the young Rebecca Newt Jorden. She was amazing, and I really wish she would have continued acting. I hear she's now 31 and teaching in California or something, having never made another film. This is too bad, as she really tied the picture together. I don't know if Ripley needed a daughter figure to replace her dead daughter (this seems very contrived), but it worked.Lance Henriksen appears as Bishop, probably his best role.

Face hugging, chest popping and outright carnage ensue, as one by one the crew is left to fend for themselves.This film goes down as a classic, and it well should have. A giant in the sci-fi world directed this (Ridley Scott, Blade Runner) and it was written by Dan O'Bannon (who also adapted Total Recall from Philip K. Dick and wrote\/directed the horror classic Return of the Living Dead). And a cast consisting of Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm? Amazing! What makes this film great is the real sense of being alone it leaves you with. Even when the crew is grouped together, they know they're trapped millions of miles from home. They must fight to survive, no running possible. The enemy changes and remains unknown, and even one of the crew may not be on their side.This film contains the iconic chest-popping scene, which was pretty cool. Granted, after seeing Spaceballs you might be let down by the version in this movie, but it's still pretty memorable. The face-huggers are also creepy, if you can imagine what that must be like to have a slimy, acid-blooded creature suctioned on your face, dropping eggs. Nasty! The film goes from sci-fi to horror and back again, mixing the two together in way that's rarely successful (although I would give a nod to Event Horizon for being a fine exception). They implement the final girl scenario well. I don't mean to ruin the plot for anyone, but not many of the crew survive and one of them is Sigourney Weaver (which I suppose is obvious since she's in all the sequels). She knows how to be tough, even if she's not exactly pretty while doing it. (I think horror fans crave attractive women more than science fiction fans do, if this film is any evidence.) My only complaint with this film is the alien suit, which seemed too rubbery and human-like. Luckily, the director was smart and saved the reveal until much later in the movie and kept it to a minimum. Sometimes the unseen is scarier than the seen, especially if you aren't able to make the monster as scary as you planned (which is fixed in future sequels).If you haven't seen this one, see it. It sets the bar for all future science fiction films, particularly ones involving hostile alien life. I don't know if a film in the genre can be made any more without somehow paying their respects to this one.

Fargo is the kind of film that people call quirky, which is ironic in the light of its opening claim to being a true story &#150; I had my suspicions the instant it said that the events were portrayed exactly as they happened, a tall order for any film. While I think it's flawed in places, it's still an extraordinary peep into an enclosed environment; while some films like to point out small-town suburbia as a front for some seriously freaky goings on, the great strength of Fargo is that it undermines that sense of juxtaposition; it deals with life in a sleepy town and an investigation into a series of brutal murders without really presenting any major difference between them.In many thrillers setting is used to box the story in, to provide clear boundaries that provide the characters with their definitions and beyond which they cannot pass. A lot of film noir is an example of this. With the white snowdrifts of a Midwestern winter though, Fargo appears to take place in a void it has no need of boundaries since there is nothing for it to mark, no sense of a place where here stops being here and becomes there. In some indoor shots the outside world is literally featureless, as if the entire film takes place inside a giant ping pong ball. This sense of blankness is far more isolating than any found in the kind of crime film that romanticises the idea of Mexico as a criminal's escape route, turning it into an Eden-like haven.The atmosphere of the film comes from the sense that every character in the film feels like they belong precisely there they are so much an intrinsic part of their setting, unlike the usual stereotype of bringing in the hero from outside so that they can in effect become the audience, pointing out the place's oddities from an external perspective. Fargo gives the viewer credit for noticing this for themselves, without really having to actively reinforce the sense of place and culture. Characters are allowed to be people first and narrative devices second they sit around repeating themselves and stating the obvious, while the camera impassively lingers on shots to record them shuffle around doing whatever it is that they do. The best illustration of the film's dynamic is its leading lady, the very ordinary Marge Gunderson (a fantastic performance by Frances McDormand), who slips between her homely personal life and her gruesome professional responsibilities so smoothly that there ceases to be any delineation between the two. Her character's slow, pregnant waddle becomes her greatest asset she is someone so unbelievably good at her job that she has no need to actually look the part and hit all the usual marks. Hers is not a role that calls for an Ellen Ripley, and this justifies the film's endless &#150; and endlessly charming &#150; digressions here there and everywhere, which never feel like they're disrupting the plot.Perhaps it's no surprise then that the lease convincing characters are the out-of-towners, the two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) hired to kidnap a housewife (Kristin Rudrüd) so that her husband (William H. Macy) can collect a fortune in ransom money from her rich father (Harve Presnell). Carl (Buscemi) shows up the film's Tarantino influence most strongly, with his rambling monologues deliberately about nothing. However, this has a tendency to compromise the film's sense of authenticity since his dialogue is nowhere near as natural as Tarantino's; this is screen writing taken to the opposite extreme, with a character casting about for topics of conversation for little reason other than for the sake of not talking about the plot. Far more interesting is Stormare's near mute, Gaear. Carl is the brains of the pair; Gaear is not the brawn, but the will. He is the one who takes matters into his own hands to resolve a problem, but his motivations lie far deeper. While Buscemi's snippy crook is motivated fairly unambiguously by money, Gaear seems indifferent to it. He kills out of necessity, convenience, sometimes just pure whim, while other times it is genuinely impossible to imagine his reasons, making Marge's final words to him &#150; not understanding how he can kill people just for money &#150; all the more resonant.For all its charm and comedy, Fargo is a sometimes distressing film. Innocent people get killed or bereaved, and they evoke sympathy because of their relentless likability. Even Jerry (Macy) still feels like a nice guy in the face of his vile and cowardly crime, because he's so helpless and pathetic. The brutal violence is shocking in Fargo not because of its nature but because these are real characters getting killed rather than nameless meat-puppets who exist merely to provide action scenes to titillate the audience. If only the film had tighter characterisation of its lead villain, we could be looking at a classic with that slightly weak link in place though, Fargo is merely very good.
