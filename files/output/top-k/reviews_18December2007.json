[{"date":"18 December 2007","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Max (Dirk Bogarde) is the definitive night porter in a Vienna hotel. In his prior life, however, he was a Nazi SS camp officer who kept a 14 year old girl (Charlotte Rampling) for his special attention. Thirteen years after the war, Lucia, now grown up and the wife of a symphony conductor checks into the hotel and encounters her former captor and lover behind the night desk. Both survivors of the war experience, Max longs for a quiet existence and will kill to ensure it, while Lucia, a stunning woman, decides to stay in Vienna and rekindle her previous relationship instead of following her husband to Berlin. Flashbacks to the camp reveal that Lucia's survival instincts were honed by her sexual services to Max, as well as her entertainment skills for other SS officers. Max's little girl grown up however, means that she can identify him and the small group of former Nazis who want Lucia out of Max's life set about to ensure the couple's demise. As Max and Lucia fall back into their former master and slave roles, the Stockholm syndrome or the perversity of love under duress is examined.Dirk Borgarde gives a brilliant as well as subtle and sympathetic performance in the role of an evil,guilt-riddled, obsessed man who is incapable of letting go of the past, nor wants to allow Lucia to be rid of him. Stunning Charlotte Rampling, once touted as the most beautiful woman in the world in the 70s, is his willing victim of their sick, deteriorating situation. Unable to break away and incapable of denying the reality of her past lover, the doomed Lucia repeats her shame with Max in Rampling's exquisite performance that is pathetic and magnetic on screen.Written and directed by women, this unusual film examines topics of victimization, obsession, and guilt as a sick, extreme form of love, a subject a head of its time in 1974. With the sub-text of Nazis seeking to avoid discovery, continuation of the decadence, and the seedy, twilight existence of jaded outsiders to society in Vienna, The Night Porter remains an outstanding adult, complex film that leaves viewers in an uneasy limbo to ponder in the end.

Unless the movie remake is absolutely fantastic, critics will rip the movie to shreds and so will a good number of viewers! Initially, I was annoyed by some of the character choices, feeling that the addition of a female for Lt.Carpentrer and a black for Ens. Parker was an act of putting too high a priority on political correctness, over entertainment.But the two, given the chance, proved that their roles were perfectly suited and they portrayed their characters brilliantly. David Alan Grier is a comic genius who had me in stitches! Dean Stockwell portrayed Capt. Binghampton with the same comic brilliance as the Late Great Joe Flynn. Tim Curry's Maj.Vladikov really gets on one's nerves with his constant complaining of being only the second biggest terrorist in the world and it is easy to despise him. But then again, Maj. Vladikov just happens to be the bad guy! So we're supposed to despise him.To really get the most out of this movie, one must forget the original series which took place during World War Two and simply focus on the this movie, which takes place in the present.The movie is funny. It has a action scenes and some edge-of-your-seat action. And if the movie was anywhere as bad as some critics made it out to be, would Ernest Borgnine, the original McHale had allowed himself to be involved with this film? I think not! Enjoy!

However, he has a taste for women and gambling, racking up an enormous debt to the local mobsters. Lawrence, ever a macho man, decides to go double or nothing on a national basketball game that will be played during his graduation ceremony. Lawrence loses and the mob sends the usual henchman for his hide. Appealing to his equally snobby father (George Plimpton) for a loan gets him nowhere. His only recourse is to ask his erstwhile roommate to switch identities with him, with Lawrence hopping a plane to Thailand as part of the Peace Corps and escaping the mob. It works, although Lawrence has to fork over his porsche to seal the deal. Once on the plane, however, Lawrence has second thoughts. Everyone is singing inspirational songs and looking forward to bringing cheer and good works to the Thai people. As he gets off the plane, Lawrence literally goes down on his knees and begs the leader to send him back. But, its no, no, no. However, things look up when a good-looking fellow Corpswoman, Beth (Rita Wilson) is assigned to the same village, along with gung-ho engineer, Tom Tuttle of Tacoma (John Candy). However, Beth won't give him the time of day and Tom is a royal pain. What will become of Lawrence, anyways, whose attitude is its not that I can't help these people, I don't want to! But, wait, how about establishing a card game or two, for money, with the locals? Things are looking up! This is a funny, funny film that is a winner every time. Hanks and Candy are very humorous while Plimpton is a scream in a brief role as the can't-be-bothered-with-details father. Wilson is touching as the woman who truly wants to help others and is torn by her attraction to a man who is a dirtbag. Gedde Watanabe is also fun as a native lad and the other Oriental cast members do a great job as well. The setting in Thailand is lovely, naturally, and the recreation of the early sixties in fashion and other properties is quite good. In fact, the opening montage of sixties photos, set to Blue Moon is very inspiring. In short, if you are stuck with an evening of drabness, get this film by whatever means necessary. You will issue three cheers for a flick that will never fail to provide some genuine laughs and nostalgia.

Though it can make the film seem corny and melodramatic at times, it also adds an emotional layer to a genre so often lacking in one. It's not a typical mad scientist film - Brundle is not crazy, and his mishap is not a scientific mistake, but a mere turn of bad luck - and so it doesn't fall prey to the typical clichés of the form, but instead forges its own narrative path. That makes it highly unique and a refreshing change from the monster movies I'm used to, even if it contains many of the hallmarks.Goldblum is really quite terrific, conveying many different emotions even while masked under layers of terrifying makeup. The way he can switch between drama and comedy, romance and tragedy without overacting is fantastic, and the fact that he manages to create a believable character at the same time is truly remarkable. It's a type of performance not usually seen in a film like this, and it's more than welcome. Both Davis and Getz are solid, but they simply pale in comparison. This is Goldblum's film.In a similar way, the film also belongs to the amazing makeup effects. They're stunning and disgusting simultaneously, and yet add another layer of realism. Even the final transformation, while being even more revolting, manages to evoke sympathy in the audience, an amazing feat for a monster in a horror flick. Indeed, Brundle's story seemed more akin to the monster in Frankenstein than the doctor, though his character embodies aspects of the latter.This is the best film I've seen by Cronenberg so far, and it's largely due the blended story, terrific lead performance, and fantastic visuals. It branches out from the typical mad scientist\/monster movie into something more, a tragedy almost worthy of Shakespeare. Grounded by Goldblum's realistic performance, it does not simply show off the terrific effects, but instead uses them to enhance and perform the story. It's a rare treat in a horror film, and makes this one of the greatest in the genre, bar none.

","genre":"Animation, Family, Fantasy"},{"date":"18 December 2007","score":"","review":" I think Mike goes back to get Nicky in Vietnam for a couple of reasons. The first being that Nicky told him one night before they left that he didn't want to be left in Vietnam alone, and he wishes that Mike would come and get him if that problem ever comes up. Also, I believe that Mike seeing Nicky's girlfriend so messed up from the possiblilty that Nicky might be dead made him want to go rescue him. The third reason I believe Mike went back was a sense of companionship. Even though Mike and Nicky had their disagreements they were great friends, both in the factory and at home. They did everything together, from getting drunk to weddings to hunting. The final piece that made Mike want to go back to Vietnam was when he saw all the money Nicky was sending to Steve. He wondered how he was getting all of the money, and realized it must be from a game called Russian roulette. Mike knew that Nicky was mentally unstable from seeing horrific events in Vietnam, and especially from the game of Russian roulette. The sad part of Mike trying to rescue Nicky, of course, is that Nicky is either so messed up that he can't, or he doesn't want to recognize Mike. In Nicky's final game of Russian Roulette he almost recognizes Mike, but it's too late and he fires the gun into his head. -- Alex Chase ","genre":null},{"date":"18 December 2007","score":"","review":" I think Mike goes back to get Nicky in Vietnam for a couple of reasons.
