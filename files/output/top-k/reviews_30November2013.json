Because I don't like most versions of the Dickens film because it's been overdone so many times that the story has practically become a cliché. Heck, there have been 95 versions of A Christmas CAROL!!! And, among the many versions were even ones that starred Mr. Magoo and Scrooge McDuck! Talk about overdoing things!!! Some of these variations are quite clever--most are not and are just cheap ways to get past writing original material. My feeling about THE MUPPET Christmas CAROL is that if you must see one, this is better than most though not as good as, in my opinion, the best version which stars George C. Scott*.Now, despite all my Scrooge-like comments, I cannot fault the film too much since despite the familiarity of the story, it's actually one of the better Muppet films. I was particularly impressed by the sets. The scenes of rooftops of London and the forest were all created on the sound stage and must have taken a tremendous amount of time and effort--and they are beautiful. Additionally, some of the other sets are amazing--such as the Cratchit house. They are just lovely. Likewise, I just loved the puppets--especially the Ghost of Christmas present. The only negative were that there were perhaps a few songs too many. Otherwise, a lovely family film overall.*While it is a very, very, very different version, I strongly recommend you see BLACKADDER'S Christmas CAROL. It is a wonderful variation on the old story--one where sweet, generous and kind Mr. Blackadder is accidentally turned into a selfish jerk by the same ghosts!

Released in 1973 it was amongst a number of films that broke new ground in dragging 'horror' away from the camp clichés of Hammer etc.The subtle performances of Christie and Sutherland and the delicious lingering direction of the misty winter'd city, which makes Venice the other leading character, set the film above the common thriller and into the realms of 'the art film'. Now this can obviously put off viewers who are looking for a more 'straight ahead' movie experience, but for those who are looking for a more sophisticated experience, 'Don't look now' delivers.Definitely a film from a European tradition rather than Hollywood, the movie uses a filmic language beautifully to express and explore the characters and the situation (providing us with clues, emotions and puzzles to keep us guessing), rather than dialogue to fully explain and tell the audience what to think.The events are taking place some months after the death of their child and Christie and Southerland excellently portray a couple teetering between crisis and denial; hanging on to each other desperately one moment, sinking into their work for distraction the next, arguing the next, taking medication, not taking medication, jumping at hopes of 'life after death' and so on.There are beautifully crafted 'red-herrings' along the way to keep you guessing and the supporting characters (such as the priest) are not spoon-fed to the audience as either good or bad but as elements of the mystery that we may or may not be seeing through the lens of the Baxter's eyes.The final scenes explores the many threads and (especially for a first time viewer) have a superb conclusion which successfully avoids sliding into a trite b-movie ending that simply 'wraps everything up'.In short, this a 1973 movie and as such is obviously a product of its time but if you like a more European style of cinema and would like to see an early supernatural thriller deftly handled by cast and crew, this is it.Oh yes - I forgot to say, it's got what I still consider to be one of the best love scenes in any movie before or since.

Then time passed and the movie became in my mind a silly comedy again, until I taped it and watched it and realised that it was actually quite clever. I had no intention of taping it until I learnt that the late Phil Hartman, the guy who played some of my favourite Simpsons' characters, was on it. As such I decided that I would watch it and when I did I thought it was very good.Sergeant Bilko (Steve Martin) is a master sergeant at Fort Dix Research and Development army base and he runs a very sophisticated gambling ring under the nose of a rather dopey commander (Dan Akroyd). Bilko is not an evil man, rather he is a slippery, fun loving, gambler. He does it not to rip people of, but simply to have fun and make life easy for him and those around him. The problem is that an old enemy of his, Major Thorn (Phil Hartman) has returned from Greenland, and when he learns of where Bilko is, sets out to destroy him.Basically this is a movie about a easy going guy who goes up against a stuck up rule following senior. It is the idea that life is meant to be lived and not taken seriously, and those who do are basically bad and should be out witted. Even though I agree that we need to enjoy ourselves and have fun every so often, there is an extent to which we can do this. Even though we should have fun, we do need to realise that there is an extent to which we need to be responsible for our actions - but this movie does outline that. Bilko is supposed to marry a woman, but he keeps on forgetting the wedding and turns up late. He is confronted with the fact that he must face up to his responsibilities with her. Also, she is even more cunning than Bilko where Bilko can lead Thorn around and outwit him, Bilko is always outwitted by his fiancé. This is seen when she always seems to win when they play cards.I liked this movie and I liked Bilko's character. He is a gambler that always wins that is what his luck is like. What we should remember is that Bilko is a fictitious character and nobody ever really wins like he does. We cannot take after Bilko and go into casinos expecting to win heaps, but rather enjoy the character and remember that like Bilko, the bad characters are also exaggerated (though at times are more realistic - as my friend said about Titanic - the only realistic character was Billy Zane's character).

A movie too uncommercial and ambitious for mainstream Hollywood has become quickly a cult movie and gained fame. You will either love it or hate it. I love it.At it's heart DD is a story about dysfunctional family. Donnie is intelligent , independent and sensitive teenager that can't communicate too well with his family , friends or teachers . It's a teenage drama told with honesty that is hard to find . It's easy to see that Kelly writes about something he did experience too. Not only Donnie isn't understood , but also Chinese girl Cherita , teacher Karen and his girlfriend Gretchen. It's a story about search for meaning of life , fear of death , looking for God , destiny and free will. All those subject are treated seriously and with subtlety. Jake Gyllenhal gives a performance of lifetime as emotionally troubled teenager. He portrays so many different emotions of Donnie with talent never found in his other roles. It's a performance that deserve at least an Oscar nomination. His real life sister Maggie Gyllenhal gives him solid support playing his&#x85; sister. Patrick Swayze gives an interesting performance as the fraud Jim Cunningham. Drew Barrymore (who is also one of the producers of the movie) gives a surprisingly for her mature role as the teacher Karen. Bet Grant shines as fanatical teacher Kitty. I also admire Jena Malone for heartbreaking performance as the delicate Gretchen. DD has a fantastical soundtrack , which includes songs like  The killing moon by Echo and The Bunnymen , Head over hells by Tears for fears , Notorious by Duran Duran , Love will tear us apart by Joy Division and especially Mad world by Gary Jules and Michael Andrews. All the songs are well placed in the movie. The sequence where Mad world appears is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen.Richard Kelly directs this movie in a fantastic way. With the help of atmospheric music by Michael Andrews and creepy photography by Steven Porter he creates a movie that is really dark . A true haunting sadness and mystery seems to be everywhere.

It's also a tribute to the 80's (the action takes place in 1988).Donnie Darko can't be a masterpiece , because of one problem . Richard Kelly wanted to give the viewer as much freedom as possible to make his own interpretation of what is going on. The movie is open to interpretations &#x96; it was a dream , Donnie's imagination , God's interference , time travel paradox or side effect of pills. Kelly achieved that by hiding from the audience information necessary to really understand the movie the way it was always intended. The fact that the Director's cut and the official website exist is a proof that Kelly himself admits of failing to make Donnie Darko a self-contained medium. Without most of the information from Philosophy of time travel (it is expanded in the Director's cut) it's not strange that many viewer's weren't able to understand the complex story .It doesn't change the fact that Donnie Darko is one of the most original , ambitious and thought-provoking movies I've ever seen. Richard Kelly will probably stay a one-hit wonder director . I doubt he will anything even half as good as DD in the future.

A movie too uncommercial and ambitious for mainstream Hollywood has become quickly a cult movie and gained fame. You will either love it or hate it. I love it.At it's heart DD is a story about dysfunctional family. Donnie is intelligent , independent and sensitive teenager that can't communicate too well with his family , friends or teachers . It's a teenage drama told with honesty that is hard to find . It's easy to see that Kelly writes about something he did experience too. Not only Donnie isn't understood , but also Chinese girl Cherita , teacher Karen and his girlfriend Gretchen. It's a story about search for meaning of life , fear of death , looking for God , destiny and free will. All those subject are treated seriously and with subtlety. Jake Gyllenhal gives a performance of lifetime as emotionally troubled teenager. He portrays so many different emotions of Donnie with talent never found in his other roles. It's a performance that deserve at least an Oscar nomination. His real life sister Maggie Gyllenhal gives him solid support playing his&#x85; sister. Patrick Swayze gives an interesting performance as the fraud Jim Cunningham. Drew Barrymore (who is also one of the producers of the movie) gives a surprisingly for her mature role as the teacher Karen. Bet Grant shines as fanatical teacher Kitty. I also admire Jena Malone for heartbreaking performance as the delicate Gretchen. DD has a fantastical soundtrack , which includes songs like  The killing moon by Echo and The Bunnymen , Head over hells by Tears for fears , Notorious by Duran Duran , Love will tear us apart by Joy Division and especially Mad world by Gary Jules and Michael Andrews. All the songs are well placed in the movie. The sequence where Mad world appears is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen.Richard Kelly directs this movie in a fantastic way. With the help of atmospheric music by Michael Andrews and creepy photography by Steven Porter he creates a movie that is really dark . A true haunting sadness and mystery seems to be everywhere. The movie has soul and heart . It's sad , scary and full of black humor. It's art , not entertainment despite using a pop culture imagery (time travel portals , scary figures). It's also a tribute to the 80's (the action takes place in 1988).Donnie Darko can't be a masterpiece , because of one problem . Richard Kelly wanted to give the viewer as much freedom as possible to make his own interpretation of what is going on. The movie is open to interpretations &#x96; it was a dream , Donnie's imagination , God's interference , time travel paradox or side effect of pills. Kelly achieved that by hiding from the audience information necessary to really understand the movie the way it was always intended. The fact that the Director's cut and the official website exist is a proof that Kelly himself admits of failing to make Donnie Darko a self-contained medium. Without most of the information from Philosophy of time travel (it is expanded in the Director's cut) it's not strange that many viewer's weren't able to understand the complex story .It doesn't change the fact that Donnie Darko is one of the most original , ambitious and thought-provoking movies I've ever seen. Richard Kelly will probably stay a one-hit wonder director . I doubt he will anything even half as good as DD in the future. It doesn't change the fact that he created something that deserves to be admired &#x96; drama about loneliness , pain and fear told by using science fiction. I give it 9\/10.

First, I very rarely enjoy science fiction films; less than a handful in my entire life...and I'm 64 years old. Second, I very rarely enjoy military movies. Third, I rarely enjoy disaster films. And those genres are what this movie is. And I love it! The cast does a terrific job here. I was never much of a fan of Jeff Goldblum, but here as an MIT-educated computer expert, he's really good. In fact, there's only a handful of films I've really enjoyed him in, this being the principal one. This film, and Six Degrees Of Separation were the two movies that led me to realize that Will Smith was a lot more than just a sitcom actor and a rapper. I've enjoyed him ever since. He is wonderful here as a Marine pilot. Bill Pullman is no favorite of mine, but he does well here as the President and former war fighter pilot. I always enjoy seeing Robert Loggia, and no less so here as a general and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Randy Quaid is good as comic relief, but his role here is just a little deeper, and he handles it well...though the role as an alcoholic crop duster and veteran Vietnam War pilot who claims to have been an alien abductee is illogical. James Duval, as Quaid's son, does well here. To bad he's just a little too weird to be more Hollywood mainstream; he showed potential. Judd Hirsch...well, too stereotypical as an old Jew in this film for me to enjoy his performance. Mary McDonnell is low key as the First Lady. Vivica A. Fox...this was probably the first time I ever noticed her, though it took quite a few years before I became fully aware of her.The special effects here are quite stunning.The story? Well, as with all science fiction, there's a lot to swallow here. The biggest of which being that during a war for survival the American president would actually get involved in the battle by flying a jet...even if he had been a former military pilot. But, don't over-think the film. Just enjoy it. It's fun and exciting. ","genre":null},{"date":"30 November 2013","score":"","review":" I'll tell you how I know that this is a REALLY good movie.

The ending is more logical and unpredictable and the whole movie doesn't seem to really too heavy on the surprising ending than it's famous older brother. It's like a cherry on the top of delicious cake rather than the main attraction of the movie. The somber mood stays with you and whole picture really feels like a work of art , not entertainment. It does have few things in common with Sixth sense (Willis , atmosphere , twist endings , supernatural undertones) , but please watch it as an completely separate movie.This movie takes time for buildup of atmosphere, strong character interaction, and it's heavily centered on characters and their psychology. Shyamalan might be the best director since Hitchcock with his ability to create suspense. Fall on the stairs , drowning in the swimming pool , the fight &#x96; those scenes are really breathtaking and magical.Unbreakable walks a fine line between being realistic and comic bookish.

The film works well as a sentimental introduction to his oeuvre. Already its title refers to De Sica's favorite subject of childhood which he studied all his life. In this film, he immerses into the realm of the child's gaze.Although all the ingredients for a banal melodrama are present, De Sica eludes them with elegance. He does this precisely by focusing on the subject of childhood and, most importantly, on the child protagonist, his subjective experience and feelings of abandonment. Some may consider the adult characters of this divorce drama thin or black and white, and while this may be true, it is perfectly justified just as well because De Sica defines them by the child's point of view. Thus they are characterized by his mental distinctions, images and emotions.As a matter of fact, the theme of watching is a leading idea in The Children Are Watching Us. Throughout the film the protagonist observes his environment the animals, the city, the puppet theater, the urban movement and, above all, the grown-ups. Not only is the familiar idea of the child's blaming gaze present but also his way of learning by imitation. A certain climax of this theme of watching can be seen in the scene where the boy and his father remain quiet, but experience a moment of understanding which De Sica depicts only by using extreme close-ups of their honest faces. To go further in the analysis of the title, it should be noted that it is in plural, although there is really just one child, thus suggesting a more universal, moral message. The title is especially associated with the blaming gaze; that is to say, the child's ability to judge us by approval and disapproval. This is equivalent with the philosophy of De Sica's masterpiece Bicycle Thieves (1948) where a child character is used as a moral observer or, should I say, the protagonist's moral conscience. In fact, a film historian Peter Bondanella has well noted that Roberto Rossellini's manifesto film of Italian neo-realism, Rome, Open City (1945) established children as the symbol for the future of Italy as a nation. This is evident in many films from the era and especially in De Sica's Shoeshine (1946) where boys must kneel down before American soldiers to shine their shoes. Although The Children Are Watching Us is completely free from such political thought as a sentimental drama, it gains its sadness from precisely similar elements Shoeshine does. In other words, the child protagonist feels emotionally helpless in a situation he doesn't understand, but what makes this even more poignant is the child's awareness of this situation; that is, of his own helplessness.

Throughout the film the protagonist observes his environment the animals, the city, the puppet theater, the urban movement and, above all, the grown-ups. Not only is the familiar idea of the child's blaming gaze present but also his way of learning by imitation. A certain climax of this theme of watching can be seen in the scene where the boy and his father remain quiet, but experience a moment of understanding which De Sica depicts only by using extreme close-ups of their honest faces. To go further in the analysis of the title, it should be noted that it is in plural, although there is really just one child, thus suggesting a more universal, moral message. The title is especially associated with the blaming gaze; that is to say, the child's ability to judge us by approval and disapproval. This is equivalent with the philosophy of De Sica's masterpiece Bicycle Thieves (1948) where a child character is used as a moral observer or, should I say, the protagonist's moral conscience. In fact, a film historian Peter Bondanella has well noted that Roberto Rossellini's manifesto film of Italian neo-realism, Rome, Open City (1945) established children as the symbol for the future of Italy as a nation. This is evident in many films from the era and especially in De Sica's Shoeshine (1946) where boys must kneel down before American soldiers to shine their shoes. Although The Children Are Watching Us is completely free from such political thought as a sentimental drama, it gains its sadness from precisely similar elements Shoeshine does. In other words, the child protagonist feels emotionally helpless in a situation he doesn't understand, but what makes this even more poignant is the child's awareness of this situation; that is, of his own helplessness.

The film works well as a sentimental introduction to his oeuvre. Already its title refers to De Sica's favorite subject of childhood which he studied all his life. In this film, he immerses into the realm of the child's gaze.Although all the ingredients for a banal melodrama are present, De Sica eludes them with elegance. He does this precisely by focusing on the subject of childhood and, most importantly, on the child protagonist, his subjective experience and feelings of abandonment.

Some people may complain that the constant repeat of Rachmaninoff's beautiful music is manipulative and overdone, that there is a lack of humor, and that so many things in the film just don't add up. But when you are touched by a film like this, hard-hearted critics don't matter, you forgive the mistakes, and overlook some of the sillier touches. What results is a time-travel drama about never-ending love that grabs you from the moment an old lady (Susan French) approaches aspiring playwright Christopher Reeve, places an old watch in his hand, and whispers, Come back to me.Who is this beautiful old woman with the face of an angel still wearing turn of the 20th Century get-up and why is she interested in a total stranger? Well, it takes years for Reeve to discover his own interest in her, and it is all by accident. I thought for years that the beautiful Hotel del Coronado near San Diego was the setting for it, having passed by that landmark back in the early 1980's, but further research proved me wrong, even though the original novel was set there and that they had originally intended to film it there. It is a beautiful resort right on Lake Huron where Reeve ends up, coming face to face with a portrait of the legendary stage actress who suddenly retired after a stage appearance there in 1912, ironically the same year as the Titanic disaster.Researching her, Reeve discovers she is none other than the gorgeous old woman who approached him years before, now deceased, and realizes that somehow they are connected. A discussion with a time travel expert makes him realize he must travel back to meet her, and somehow he does. She (Jane Seymour) somehow recognizes him, but her jealous producer (Christopher Plummer) is suspicious. Somehow, he knows just who Reeve is, and believes that this will destroy her. Plummer schemes to keep them apart, but time travel, as Reeve was warned, is a dangerous thing, and just as romance begins to bloom, irony strikes leading to tragedy.There is a gem of casting with Jane Seymour as the young Elise and Susan French as her in her 80's. Ms. French was everywhere in the 1980's on Dallas, Falcon Crest, Bare Essence, Little House on the Prairie and many other T.V. series. It seems to be more than a coincidence that their story is almost similar to that of Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart's in Titanic, with a brooch the prop of history rather than Elise's watch.Reeve, following up Superman with this romantic drama, was a sensitive young actor, and he puts his whole heart into this project. Romance is the word here, and the ability to suspend disbelief is a must in order to appreciate every aspect of this sweet story. Bill Erwin is memorable as Arthur, the old bellboy whom Reeve crosses and meets as a young toddler decades before, and veteran actress Teresa Wright good as old Elise's former companion who reveals Elise's past to Reeve when he visits her.The gorgeous Seymour is a radiant leading lady, filled with both fire and femininity, and here is as far from Dr. Quinn as you can get. This film unfortunately flopped badly during its initial run due to a cynical nature of the world in the early 1980's where the rise of block-busters stood in the way of a quiet old-fashioned fantasy romance from becoming a hit. Fortunately, there are many other non-cynics who are able to see with their heart and leave their brain on pause when watching films like this, and thanks to audiences like us, this film has gotten the cult status that it deserves, even though it is far from the typical cult film as you can get.

Or a dream.The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction, not the formulas of modern movies. Its hero, played by Tom Hanks, is a thoroughly decent man with an IQ of 75, who manages between the 1950s and the 1980s to become involved in every major event in American history. And he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields.And yet this is not a heartwarming story about a mentally retarded man. That cubbyhole is much too small and limiting for Forrest Gump. The movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being too clever by half. Forrest is clever by just exactly enough.Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role.I can't think of anyone else as Gump, after seeing how Hanks makes him into a person so dignified, so straight-ahead. The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths.Forrest is born to an Alabama boardinghouse owner (Sally Field) who tries to correct his posture by making him wear braces, but who never criticizes his mind. When Forrest is called stupid, his mother tells him, Stupid is as stupid does, and Forrest turns out to be incapable of doing anything less than profound. Also, when the braces finally fall from his legs, it turns out he can run like the wind.That's how he gets a college football scholarship, in a life story that eventually becomes a running gag about his good luck. Gump the football hero becomes Gump the Medal of Honor winner in Vietnam, and then Gump the Ping-Pong champion, Gump the shrimp boat captain, Gump the millionaire stockholder (he gets shares in a new fruit company named Apple Computer), and Gump the man who runs across America and then retraces his steps.It could be argued that with his IQ of 75 Forrest does not quite understand everything that happens to him. Not so. He understands everything he needs to know, and the rest, the movie suggests, is just surplus. He even understands everything that's important about love, although Jenny, the girl he falls in love with in grade school and never falls out of love with, tells him, Forrest, you don't know what love is. She is a stripper by that time.The movie is ingenious in taking Forrest on his tour of recent American history. The director, Robert Zemeckis, is experienced with the magic that special effects can do (his credits include the Back To The Future movies and Who Framed Roger Rabbit), and here he uses computerized visual legerdemain to place Gump in historic situations with actual people.Forrest stands next to the schoolhouse door with George Wallace, he teaches Elvis how to swivel his hips, he visits the White House three times, he's on the Dick Cavett show with John Lennon, and in a sequence that will have you rubbing your eyes with its realism, he addresses a Vietnam-era peace rally on the Mall in Washington. Special effects are also used in creating the character of Forrest's Vietnam friend Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), a Ron Kovic type who quite convincingly loses his legs.Using carefully selected TV clips and dubbed voices, Zemeckis is able to create some hilarious moments, as when LBJ examines the wound in what Forrest describes as my butt-ox. And the biggest laugh in the movie comes after Nixon inquires where Forrest is staying in Washington, and then recommends the Watergate. (That's not the laugh, just the setup.) As Forrest's life becomes a guided tour of straight-arrow America, Jenny (played by Robin Wright) goes on a parallel tour of the counterculture. She goes to California, of course, and drops out, tunes in, and turns on. She's into psychedelics and flower power, antiwar rallies and love-ins, drugs and needles. Eventually it becomes clear that between them Forrest and Jenny have covered all of the landmarks of our recent cultural history, and the accommodation they arrive at in the end is like a dream of reconciliation for our society.

The movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being too clever by half. Forrest is clever by just exactly enough.Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role.I can't think of anyone else as Gump, after seeing how Hanks makes him into a person so dignified, so straight-ahead. The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths.Forrest is born to an Alabama boardinghouse owner (Sally Field) who tries to correct his posture by making him wear braces, but who never criticizes his mind. When Forrest is called stupid, his mother tells him, Stupid is as stupid does, and Forrest turns out to be incapable of doing anything less than profound. Also, when the braces finally fall from his legs, it turns out he can run like the wind.That's how he gets a college football scholarship, in a life story that eventually becomes a running gag about his good luck. Gump the football hero becomes Gump the Medal of Honor winner in Vietnam, and then Gump the Ping-Pong champion, Gump the shrimp boat captain, Gump the millionaire stockholder (he gets shares in a new fruit company named Apple Computer), and Gump the man who runs across America and then retraces his steps.It could be argued that with his IQ of 75 Forrest does not quite understand everything that happens to him. Not so. He understands everything he needs to know, and the rest, the movie suggests, is just surplus. He even understands everything that's important about love, although Jenny, the girl he falls in love with in grade school and never falls out of love with, tells him, Forrest, you don't know what love is. She is a stripper by that time.The movie is ingenious in taking Forrest on his tour of recent American history. The director, Robert Zemeckis, is experienced with the magic that special effects can do (his credits include the Back To The Future movies and Who Framed Roger Rabbit), and here he uses computerized visual legerdemain to place Gump in historic situations with actual people.Forrest stands next to the schoolhouse door with George Wallace, he teaches Elvis how to swivel his hips, he visits the White House three times, he's on the Dick Cavett show with John Lennon, and in a sequence that will have you rubbing your eyes with its realism, he addresses a Vietnam-era peace rally on the Mall in Washington. Special effects are also used in creating the character of Forrest's Vietnam friend Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), a Ron Kovic type who quite convincingly loses his legs.Using carefully selected TV clips and dubbed voices, Zemeckis is able to create some hilarious moments, as when LBJ examines the wound in what Forrest describes as my butt-ox. And the biggest laugh in the movie comes after Nixon inquires where Forrest is staying in Washington, and then recommends the Watergate. (That's not the laugh, just the setup.) As Forrest's life becomes a guided tour of straight-arrow America, Jenny (played by Robin Wright) goes on a parallel tour of the counterculture. She goes to California, of course, and drops out, tunes in, and turns on. She's into psychedelics and flower power, antiwar rallies and love-ins, drugs and needles. Eventually it becomes clear that between them Forrest and Jenny have covered all of the landmarks of our recent cultural history, and the accommodation they arrive at in the end is like a dream of reconciliation for our society. What a magical movie. ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"30 November 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The Civil War is an immensely interesting era. The philosopher, the sociologist, the historian of religion or technology, they can't fail each one to find a rich world to explore. It has everything. A rich political tapestry. War of course. Sagas of both victory and loss. It has on both sides a Cause and closure. Stories of both Northern innovation and Southern ingenuity. Gaffes, some truly huge ones.Here we get possibly the most senseless aspect of it the battle itself. The biggest one. The high crest of the Southern tide. The filmmaker has no doubt studied the great battle scenes in film. Eisenstein, Lean, Welles, Bondarchuk. He does mostly well. He covers most of the narrative ground fairly well. He does this all in the naturalistic pace of the western. Overall it conveys a sense of Gettysburg, and yet it's the sense a highschool history teacher would try to convey to his class. Figures. Speeches. Heroism and futility. I don't know if it's constructive history or not. But here they had an opportunity to do something better. They secured close to five hours of screen time to cover just a few days, an opportunity to go from the epic trajectory, the closed saga, to the openended moment-at-hand.And isn't this, as much as anything else, what captivates about the Civil War? At so many junctures things could have gone wildly different. Staying on Gettysburg, what if Ewell had taken the high ground on that first day? There is a rich story, the one jotted in so much Civil War literature, and yet at every point indeterminate horizons suggest parallel universes to ponder. But how to exemplify this as cinematic horizon?A striking moment early in the film is where Lee with his aides is startled to hear artillery in the distance, what Lee doesn't know yet is that Southern troops a few miles ahead have run into Union cavalry and the battle has started. Lee turns and asks whose artillery is that.So here's a war where the commanding general has no way of knowing, and has to wait for someone to ride all the way there to find out, and ride all the way back to report. Can you imagine the eternity of waiting? Of just hearing sounds of war but not knowing just what it means? But this would require a wholly different film, one that goes where the historian can't with his pen and captures confused humans for whom there is no 'Battle of Gettysburg' yet and all that noise beyond the trees is not yet decisive fate.I dream about a Gettysburg film that conveys the density of destiny not with speechifying but with spatial density. That isn't full of rousing music over senseless war. That explores the rich possibilities of sound and space, concealment and presence, one that is as gruelling to watch as it must have been for a young Union boy staring at the woods for hours waiting for rebels to materialize.
