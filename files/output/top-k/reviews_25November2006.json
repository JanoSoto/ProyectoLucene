For example, when the characters type on the keyboard, a echoing sound affect is added which is extremely funny. Also, when they show a virus, it is graphical and it talks and interact with you, which is extremely funny. The last thing that made me laugh was the actual techno talk that they do. It is almost funny and hysterical as most people know something about computers and they know most of the techno talks in this movie are complete blabbing of the mouth. Finally, it seems that this movie is bent on the fact that hackers can take over TV networks and make shows appear in the wee hours of the morning and make traffic lights turn red and turn on sprinklers at certain times. Almost funnier is that the movie is bent on the fact that all hackers are from MIT and that any hacker must go to that school in order to be elite.The one thing I found unusual is that at the time of this movie, laptop computers weren't exactly cheap like they are now. If I remembered correctly, laptops can cost upwards to 2-3 thousands dollars at the time, and I seriously doubt that highschool students (as portrayed in this movie) can just go out and buy one. I also find it odd that the movie portrays hackers take their crimes at payphone boots with laptops and all sorts of hookups to conceal their identity. I even find it more odd that there is a subculture where every hackers know each other. In this movie, it's like, Do you know a hacker named Acid Burn, and then suddenly everyone knows who it is.One thing this movie is true is the fact that nearly all casual hackers are teens (someone who is in highschool). Rarely do you hear hackers who are in their late 30s or 40s. I must say that based on real life cases, the most destructive hackers are the one who goes to college, whereas, the ones who stalks and terrorizes individuals are teens.Overall, I am pleased with the movie. Even though the movie is far from anything technical, it captures the culture of hacking. Namely the clothing style and the attitude are very true to someone who is techno (not exactly a hacker, but someone who really likes computers).

Of course, the trick is, finding an actual good one. The 80s was a decade chock full of them, but the past two decades, we've seen quite a decline on full-powered action movies destined to destroy the plot and still be able to run on fight after gunfight after explosion after unnecessary roughness. The Rundown is an example of an action flick that doesn't allow the plot to conquer the film, and allows for style to conquer substance. The Transporter relies on an extremely simple plot and expands upon it with a long action scene that runs in the second half of the movie. Jerry Bruckheimer knows how to blow things up (a lot of things I may add), and while this isn't always good for Hollywood, which doesn't get many films nowadays that can be attributed to the word instant classic or masterpiece, the technique does indeed work for this movie; the mindless yet satisfying Con Air.Con Air has enough action, blood, and guts to make you look away at the screen and wipe off the bloodstains that have suddenly appeared all over your shirt. While being hyper-violent but not a point of losing too much realism, Con Air stands as one of Bruckheimer's best works, director Simon West's best work, and one of the best action movies to come out within the last 15 years. Also, unlike most action movies released in history, this one actually has believable acting, some convincingly tough and creepy convicts, and also doesn't allow the sappy moments to soak in on the running time.Convicts. Plane. Convicts entering plane. Smart convicts. Hero of story is at the wrong place at the wrong time. Convicts take over. Simple enough? Now, add the fact that more convicts have to enter the plane, add the fact that some feds want to shoot the plane down despite the innocent folks boarding, add the one guy about to die if he doesn't take his insulin, add the one female aboard and a rapist ready for his next victim, and then add the psychotic murderer who scares even the toughest aboard. We get conflict after conflict after conflict; it doesn't end. By the time the movie is over, we'll be able to see four to five fights, one massive gun battle, and a dozen action sequences, some ranging from short, to amazingly loooong.Scott Rosenberg does a superb job in giving the characters in the film a lot to do, even with the film clocking in at two hours. Also, he doesn't sap the movie up with too many tear-jerking scenes about Cameron Poe (Nicholas Cage) wanting to see his wife and daughter after 8 years. John Malkovich is excellent as the main villain, as he is violent, unsympathetic, yet portrays himself as trigger-happy, when he is much smarter than the impression he gives others. Ving Rhames does his usual awesome performance as the main villain's second-hand man. Rounding out the supporting cast is Dave Chappelle, Steve Buscemi, Danny Trejo, Mykelti Williamson, M.C. Gainey, and also John Cusack.Con Air takes no prisoners, literally and figuratively. This is a Man's film, and it's not for the easily offended or queasy. This film has it all good fights, action sequences that stretch beyond the imagination, brutal deaths, amazing gun battles, and then an obsession with pyrotechnics that delivers so many explosions, it almost looks like World War III was going on. The special effects were excellent and was never overused, and rarely did it ever look unrealistic. But for some odd reason, everything flammable that you can possibly think of just happens to show up.With little time to think about what just happened, you are forced to sit there, like some of the victims in the plane, and go along for a wild ride that seemed to have no end. Nonetheless, it's a better ride than you would expect out of an action movie that has more fire than air in almost every frame. Witty dialogue, nice little twists, well-thought out sequences, and a cleverly creepy scene involving the most psychotic killer and the most innocent of children rounds out the 1997 action blockbuster.Bottom Line Lowlifes, single men, get off your seat, and rent Con Air. You'll forget your troubles; you'll forget everything that's going on, because this movie won't allow you to think. Instead, you'll be practically forced to sit there and witness all the carnage, all the senseless violence, and all the bitter, no-holds-barred action that is sprinkled upon every single set and scenery in the movie. No, that's not a bad thing at all. Despite the fact that mixing action with good acting and great writing happens so seldom it can be considered a modern-day contradiction, Con Air pulls it off nicely. The movie doesn't take long to start, and once it starts, it will continue flying high on bloodshed up until the very end. This is indeed a Man's film. Before Snakes on a Plane, there were convicts on a plane. Difference is, the snakes didn't have motivation, or weapons of mass destruction.

But the effects were extremely cheesy, like the four guys beating the sides of tent. Was I really supposed to think it was anything else? Maybe it's because this movie never really took me there.

Also you never actually see the Blair Witch. It's kind of like making a song about a Teenage Wasteland and calling it Baba O'Reilly. Where is Baba O'Reilly? You might say the Witch is invisible to explain her pronounced absence. Ah, but then how did they have an old drawing of the Witch in that book? Hmn? Also the editing was impossible.

This companion movie was obviously shot with a different camera than either of the ones used in making Blair Witch, making it an even more obvious fake, and it was twice as boring.While we're at it, didn't they film the inside of the Witch's house?

There was absolutely no way for me to get into the illusion of this movie with so many flaws continually shouting at me that it was a hoax. They might as well have put that kid from The Last Action Hero in here saying over and over, It's just a movie. It's not real. It astounds me to think that some people actually thought it was a true documentary. On the scary scale, 1 to 10, I give this a 2, only for the few freaky (but not really scary) scenes.

A hoax like this can only be done once. There were a couple of nice touches in the movie, like them trying to follow a stream and winding up in the same spot. That's freaky. Also, good acting. But the effects were extremely cheesy, like the four guys beating the sides of tent. Was I really supposed to think it was anything else? Maybe it's because this movie never really took me there. At least with the Ninth Gate, I could suspend disbelief long enough to accept the idea that the three books really are evil and the hero's life might have been in danger a few times, but not here. Also you never actually see the Blair Witch. It's kind of like making a song about a Teenage Wasteland and calling it Baba O'Reilly. Where is Baba O'Reilly? You might say the Witch is invisible to explain her pronounced absence. Ah, but then how did they have an old drawing of the Witch in that book? Hmn? Also the editing was impossible. If you're recording the same thing with two separate cameras, you will get the same action twice from two separate perspectives, not a smoothly-edited single thread of continuity. I especially chuckled when the one guy was talking into one camera and his voice carried over flawlessly into the footage of the other camera, all supposedly unedited. That was really obvious. By editing it professionally, it lost any credibility it might have had in my mind. And why did they go in that house anyway? How stupid was that? To make matters worse, they made a companion video for this movie (before Blair Witch 2) that you could rent, supposedly of newly-discovered video. At least they threw it in free when I rented Blair Witch. It was the one guy and the girl sitting in the tent saying things like, Wow, that was a lot of weird stuff that happened today, huh?

Al Pacino's Tony Montana might be a coke-snorting low-life and remorseless killer, but he's big on honor and family values so the audience can identify with the character to some extent even if we are shocked by his ruthless methods. The film contains some memorable highlights that made it a real winner at the time of its release and it still holds up pretty well despite the dated automobiles and bizarre clothes. The violence is extreme and makes even the most jaded audiences tend to set aside the popcorn and pay attention. Tony has a psychotic, and in due course, murderous jealously of his sister and we are not left in too much doubt as to the incestuous connotations. He suffers rejection by his mother, who regards him as being beyond redemption; surely the hardest of rods to bear for any villain in the traditional mold.We actually start to feel sorry for Tony and EVERYONE in the movie house cheers when he summarily dispatches the Columbian asshole who is about to blow up a target's car with the kiddies on board.My favorite scene is the famous bath segment , where Tony sounds off at length about the ills of the world while soaking himself in the biggest bathtub in America, coked up to the eyeballs. The message comes through loud and clear You can have all that money, power, and the woman of your dreams, but if mom won't talk to you, then you're going to be just one sorry pilgrim.Al Pacino dominates the film in a similar manner to the way Eli Wallach took control over proceedings in The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly , but unlike the latter film,Scarface tends to suffer from not having a effective foil for the principle character. However, the supporting players all put in some serviceable performances. Michelle Pfiefer is quite effective as the bored trophy-wife and the other hoodlums are all pretty good. As in all the best gangster flicks, the cops have a minor role to play, and are basically just there to tag along and tidy up after the gangland carnage. Like in those old classics where Jimmy Cagney or Edward G Robinson did their stuff, we all know that that Tony has to get it before the end of the last reel. The finale doesn't disappoint, as he takes his leave us in the traditional style, screaming defiance at his multitude of enemies while blazing away at them with a Chicago Piano. As with Cody Jarrett in White Heat, Tony Montana the loner, doomed by his life-style and lack of self-control, is retired undefeated and unrepentant. A good take on the standard down side of the American dream theme, and I found the film more enjoyable than the more sophisticated, but convoluted and laborious Once Upon a Time in America My main criticism of Scarface is its tendency, probably unconscious, to push the vibe that crime may not pay, but its a good buzz while it lasts.

I was impressed by the eclectic range of characters from Hilary Swank, Al Pacino, and Robin Williams &#150; a combination that I may have put money down prior to this film the group that would never share screen time together. I was wrong. I also was eagerly anticipating what Nolan would do with this film, having not seen the original when I went to the theater; I knew that he would bring us a compelling drama that would pull the best out of our cast. I was not disappointed. I loved the combination of acting between Pacino and Williams because they had two completely different styles. I thought Swank was decent, but contributed very little to the simpleton character she was to play &#150; and I thought that Maura Tierney as the reclusive innkeeper was a great fit. I loved the way that Nolan filmed it, the cinematography was excellent, and the music kept me on the edge of my seat until the very, cliché ending. I was in awe of this film &#150; that is &#150; until I saw the original. Now, I find myself questioning the value of this film and of Nolan's honesty to the original director's vision. It nearly makes me tear up to see a great, valued independent foreign film get the slap of U.S.D.A. Hollywood on it with bigger budgets, bigger scripts, and an ending that seemed like it arrived directly from the How to build a great climax handbook handed to new &#133; mainstream directors.For those looking for a review of just this version of Insomnia, I want to initially say that watching this film on its own is good. If you have not seen the original, then this is a great eye candy film with fantastic scenes that prove that Nolan can conquer his trade if given the opportunity (remember what he did with the Batman legacy), but together these films do not match up and fans of the original will scoff at Nolan's poor attempt to bring the honesty and directness that director Erik Skjoldbjærg superbly brought to the screen. I understand that one, when making comments about Insomnia, should keep them separate, but there are so many disheartening differences between the two that I do not want others to purely watch this one with Pacino and Williams, but instead see the two and make their own assessments. To begin, Pacino is no Stellan Skarsgård (as odd as that may be to say), but Skarsgård brings a character to the screen forcing us to follow the emotional level of the events, instead of Pacino's over-the-top reactions to situations. While Skarsgård brings intensity to the character due to events and his unknown past, Pacino brings a visual to the character. You cannot seem to take your eyes off Pacino, but that is just him being the actor that he is. There are elements left out of Nolan's interpretation that are key to truly giving us the bad cop mentality that we are supposed to have about Dormer. Oddly, in the original, we are not supposed to find ourselves liking or feeling sympathy for Skarsgård, but in this one we want to see Pacino come clean and rid himself of the guilt. A big difference between the two films is the cross-referencing between Pacino and Skarsgård, because by seeing each of these two bring something new to the table, we, as viewers, saw a completely different film.Nolan's discreet changes morphs this film into something completely different that originally conceived. To call this film a remake would be tough in my eyes, because it is not a remake. It is a new interpretation of a classic film. Nolan makes some small changes to the plot which ultimately changes that course of our characters and the overall tones of the film. For example, there is quite a bit more Hollywood running in Nolan's film than in the original. Skarsgård captures our attention because of his internal conflicts, while Nolan captures our attention in his film by forcing us to watch Pacino run Williams down, to see him screaming his lines at random characters, and the ending that just epitomizes the standard that Hollywood seems to embrace. Without giving away too much detail, I must say that unlike the original, more gunfire is used, the intensity of the music is increased, and an event occurs with our main character that changes the original film completely. That is why I cannot call this film a remake in any way shape or form. This is an interpretation, albeit a very close interpretation, but not identical. Nolan took chances, he changed the frame of the story, and gave us a pure 100% uncut slice of Hollywood that one could almost witness in any blockbuster released during the summer months. It was pathetic and if I were the director of the original, Nolan's interpretation would have made me rather upset.Overall, I still like Nolan's work, and while I have lowered my enjoyment of this film after seeing this original, I must say that from 2002-present I thoroughly enjoyed Nolan's Insomnia. So, where does that put us currently? I would suggest this film to friends mainly because I am a sucker for Pacino's work (early and recent), and for some strange reason I cannot say no to a Robin Williams' film (even if this took place during his dark stint). I also think that Nolan's craft is unmatched today, and while he will conform to Hollywood (i.e. Insomnia), he uses it to pay rent and finance his next films. I will say this to friends as well, if you want to see a great film, one must see the original Insomnia and witness a truly disturbing character at his best. Skarsgård is on the top of his game with version, and Pacino can not compete.Grade *** ½ out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"25 November 2006","score":"","review":" In 2002 I went to the theaters and saw Insomnia on the big-screen.

I was impressed by the eclectic range of characters from Hilary Swank, Al Pacino, and Robin Williams &#150; a combination that I may have put money down prior to this film the group that would never share screen time together. I was wrong. I also was eagerly anticipating what Nolan would do with this film, having not seen the original when I went to the theater; I knew that he would bring us a compelling drama that would pull the best out of our cast. I was not disappointed. I loved the combination of acting between Pacino and Williams because they had two completely different styles. I thought Swank was decent, but contributed very little to the simpleton character she was to play &#150; and I thought that Maura Tierney as the reclusive innkeeper was a great fit. I loved the way that Nolan filmed it, the cinematography was excellent, and the music kept me on the edge of my seat until the very, cliché ending. I was in awe of this film &#150; that is &#150; until I saw the original. Now, I find myself questioning the value of this film and of Nolan's honesty to the original director's vision. It nearly makes me tear up to see a great, valued independent foreign film get the slap of U.S.D.A. Hollywood on it with bigger budgets, bigger scripts, and an ending that seemed like it arrived directly from the How to build a great climax handbook handed to new &#133; mainstream directors.For those looking for a review of just this version of Insomnia, I want to initially say that watching this film on its own is good. If you have not seen the original, then this is a great eye candy film with fantastic scenes that prove that Nolan can conquer his trade if given the opportunity (remember what he did with the Batman legacy), but together these films do not match up and fans of the original will scoff at Nolan's poor attempt to bring the honesty and directness that director Erik Skjoldbjærg superbly brought to the screen. I understand that one, when making comments about Insomnia, should keep them separate, but there are so many disheartening differences between the two that I do not want others to purely watch this one with Pacino and Williams, but instead see the two and make their own assessments. To begin, Pacino is no Stellan Skarsgård (as odd as that may be to say), but Skarsgård brings a character to the screen forcing us to follow the emotional level of the events, instead of Pacino's over-the-top reactions to situations. While Skarsgård brings intensity to the character due to events and his unknown past, Pacino brings a visual to the character. You cannot seem to take your eyes off Pacino, but that is just him being the actor that he is. There are elements left out of Nolan's interpretation that are key to truly giving us the bad cop mentality that we are supposed to have about Dormer. Oddly, in the original, we are not supposed to find ourselves liking or feeling sympathy for Skarsgård, but in this one we want to see Pacino come clean and rid himself of the guilt. A big difference between the two films is the cross-referencing between Pacino and Skarsgård, because by seeing each of these two bring something new to the table, we, as viewers, saw a completely different film.Nolan's discreet changes morphs this film into something completely different that originally conceived. To call this film a remake would be tough in my eyes, because it is not a remake. It is a new interpretation of a classic film. Nolan makes some small changes to the plot which ultimately changes that course of our characters and the overall tones of the film. For example, there is quite a bit more Hollywood running in Nolan's film than in the original. Skarsgård captures our attention because of his internal conflicts, while Nolan captures our attention in his film by forcing us to watch Pacino run Williams down, to see him screaming his lines at random characters, and the ending that just epitomizes the standard that Hollywood seems to embrace. Without giving away too much detail, I must say that unlike the original, more gunfire is used, the intensity of the music is increased, and an event occurs with our main character that changes the original film completely. That is why I cannot call this film a remake in any way shape or form. This is an interpretation, albeit a very close interpretation, but not identical. Nolan took chances, he changed the frame of the story, and gave us a pure 100% uncut slice of Hollywood that one could almost witness in any blockbuster released during the summer months. It was pathetic and if I were the director of the original, Nolan's interpretation would have made me rather upset.Overall, I still like Nolan's work, and while I have lowered my enjoyment of this film after seeing this original, I must say that from 2002-present I thoroughly enjoyed Nolan's Insomnia. So, where does that put us currently? I would suggest this film to friends mainly because I am a sucker for Pacino's work (early and recent), and for some strange reason I cannot say no to a Robin Williams' film (even if this took place during his dark stint). I also think that Nolan's craft is unmatched today, and while he will conform to Hollywood (i.e. Insomnia), he uses it to pay rent and finance his next films. I will say this to friends as well, if you want to see a great film, one must see the original Insomnia and witness a truly disturbing character at his best. Skarsgård is on the top of his game with version, and Pacino can not compete.Grade *** ½ out of ***** ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"25 November 2006","score":"30 out of 57 people found the following review useful","review":" Spoilers (too late - spoiled movie) I would have killed the kid &#150; too annoying.

When Capt.

The fight scenes are weak, the supporting actors (including Yaphet Kotto and Maria Conchita Alonso) largely lost, and the conclusion lame and obviously rushed in production, but you forgive a lot with Arnold, here tossing off some of his worst quips with obvious relish and finding in Richard Dawson a screen adversary every bit his equal in keeping our attention.Dawson plays Damon Killian, the falsely avuncular, deadly host of The Running Man game show, concerned in the beginning of the film about his show's sagging audience share and seeing in Richards a sure boost They want ratings, I can get ten points for his biceps alone. Dawson makes the most of his opportunity to show he had more to offer than kissing old ladies on Family Feud.Everything's showbiz in this dystopian future, even when it comes to prisoner's rights (Arnold is visited by his court-appointed theatrical agent.)

Here's how they came up with the idea for this movie. They took bits and pieces from every religion they could think of, secured a special effects budget of $50 million, added a medium-sized bag of crap, and ran it all through the high-speed blender. Goku's journey through the death realm in the Dragonball Z cartoon made much more logical sense than What Dreams May Come. Did I mention this movie was bad?

That's about all I have good to say. Does any religion actually think this insult is what the afterlife looks like, or was I unwittingly dragged through someone's bad acid trip?

I understand it now.Humphry Bogart is the quintessential Film Noir detective. He is what all actors should strive to be always in control, smooth and confidant. Mary Astor shows her talent with her brilliant portrayal of Brigid O'Shaughnessy. She goes from innocent victim to cold blooded killer effortlessly.And what can a person say about Peter Lorre except he is a legend for a reason. He is one of those people who can make you care about the character even if he is not exactly a good guy. I haven't said anything about the plot, which is stunning. I will only say that it concerns a mysterious idol called the Maltese Falcon. Saying much more would give too much away and that would be a disservice to anyone who has yet to discover this gem. Don't fall into the trap of thinking it's a dated movie. It isn't. Even though it was a contemporary piece at the time, it has aged gracefully and can now be considered a period piece in my book.A must see for any serious movie buff!!!!!!

It has a very unpromising beginning, just a storm at sea and a rowboat coming in to shore, but hang in there with it. Good movies require patience and, in this case, it will be rewarded. No, it won't be rewarded with something along the lines of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, but it will be rewarded nevertheless. If you like zany, madcap fun, then this movie is for you. The thing I like about it is, as many times as I've seen this movie over the years (and that probably numbers over twenty), I always pick up on something I miss before every time I see it. Robin Williams obviously had fun doing this movie. You can tell, he just seems to be enjoying himself. But you have to really pay attention, listen to some of his mumblings. They are quite hilarious if you can catch them. (Let me help you with the door maybe it needs a little more oil.) Favorite character? Poopdeck Pappy. He hit the nail right on the head where kids were concerned.This is the first movie I saw where they turned a cartoon into a live action movie. It does look a little weird, the zany characters and those gawky shoes they wore. And Shelly Duvall even looks like Olive Oyl in just about every movie I've seen her in. These actors did a great job of portraying the characters, and kudos should go to the costume designers and makeup artists as well. This was very well done. And the story wasn't too bad, either. It was a little slow at times, but that's forgivable. All in all, not a bad effort. Better than expected. 7 out of 10.

Right now I can think of two hours that should have graced the floor in the editing room.

And then they made him look so enlightened when he's contemplating his goofy Zen crap. Is this that Scientology stuff that Germany outlawed? The Human race is really one big soul looking out of many eyes. I don't think a single American soldier ever thought that during the war. The movie had lots of big stars in it, thinking weird stuff like that all day. It couldn't have been cheap to make either.
