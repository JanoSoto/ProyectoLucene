I could say that Keanu Reeves was not the best choice for Neo, but he fits well enough.  A cardboard cut-out of an actor for a cardboard cut-out of a character.

Looking for Meredeth Salenger? Here she is! Wish Luke Skywalker got more work? He's here too! And Mark Hamill still seems to be acting like the spiritually-enlightened Luke from Return of the Jedi. (He was like this in an episode of The X-Files as well.) Christopher Reeve plays a character concerned more about others and the greater good, just like Superman. Kirstie Alley is difficult to take seriously as the chain-smoking government scientist. It is hard to say whether she is intentionally camping it up or not, but she seems to think she's in an episode of The X-Files (it was very big back then). The most hilarious thing she utters here? Supersperm! Hunky Michael Pare seems to pop up in a lot of movies, many on at late night. And finally there's Linda Koszlowski, famous for Crocodile Dundee. Linda probably has the most to do here, emotionally, though that is still not much.Oh- a group of young blonde kids are borne from an unseen force to some of the women folk of a small town. They have incredible psychic abilities, advanced intelligence, yet lack emotion. Using their powers for evil, they plan on taking over the world, and no one is going to stop them. Though it's never really explained how or why. There is not much character development of them or the townspeople, the story prefers to focus on the repetitive destruction the children cause, rather than creating a believable scenario between the children and the townspeople. The story also jumps ahead hapharzardly, and can't decide how much attention to focus on which characters, giving all of them short shrift. It's not a movie to take seriously, unless it's supposed to be about the fear of reproduction, making fathers redundant, and having unfeeling, intelligent platinum-blonde children.It's remake roots show when the townspeople become a mob, replete with pitchforks and clubs of fire. It has an interesting premise and good ideas, but then it goes to camp.
