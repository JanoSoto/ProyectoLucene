I guess there are a few people like Dunn who had lucky escapes, how could he be so sure it would be Dunn? Shyamalan worked on the presumption of WANTING to have Dunn be a superhero, so he went to great lengths to MAKE him one through presenting circumstantial evidence. Everybody knows that circumstantial evidence isn't normally enough to prove anything, but after enough circumstantial evidence is presented Shyamalan presumes he has PROVEN enough and just goes on with the story. That just leaves a big hole!How at all did Elijah come to the assumption of there being real superheroes? Well I don't really got that at all! What stuck though was a very a very stupid explanation or whatever it was meant to be that ancient Egyptian writing was somehow connected to today's comic books. Silly in a sad way!How in hell could a normal person like Dunn never have noticed that he wasn't ever sick or ill or damaged in any way? How would he need somebody who had never met him before to tell him that, with the result of Dunn finding out that that was the truth? Absolutely ridiculous!Water! Again! Water seems to play a big roll in Shyamalan's movies&#133; or at least slightly because it felt like if water would have some climax role in this movie, but instead it became a very unnecessary and pointless swimming pool scene with absolutely no connection to anything important before or after!The scene with the boy and the gun! What a waste of true drama! But where do such ideas come from, what events lead up to such dramatically enormous and powerful moments and what happens with those in the aftermath? Answer The boy just had the gun and just had to point it at his father because he had to prove a point! What a completely chopped off way of putting drama into the movie! The boy could have been shown during the time he came up with the idea. His idea could have been explained and put into perspective! The boy should have been going through some kind of struggle with his conscience before doing that extreme thing, but no! He just gets the gun and points it at his father! The next freaked out thing was that the father shouted at the boy with the gun AFTER having tried a calm approach. A little more intelligent person would have known not to agitate or stress that boy any further in an aggressive way so that the boy wouldn't switch over into an aggressive-defence mode and in the process shoot the father by accident! Next All just break down and sigh a little, instead of springing into action! The father should have gotten very angry at the boy, maybe even slapped him &#150; just out of stress and relief at the same time! I'm not saying that that would have been cool or nice, but it would have been a bit more realistic, but what we instead see next time all of them are together is a scene that would actually make us believe nothing of that had ever happened and that it was forgotten and never spoken about. The wife didn't even tell Dunn to not leave the gun in the house anymore! Outrageously bad!The list just goes on and on and on&#133; such things just pile up to a big mountain of nasty smelly stuff! Shyamalan seems to work in such a way that he knows that he wants certain elements in the movie, lets say&#133; an interesting idea and then some drama and here and there filmed from certain angles and such. Then he comes up with the interesting idea, then he tries extremely hard to explain his (in the end rather ridiculous) interesting idea by means of circumstantial evidence (because he himself can grasp the depth which would be needed to make his idea credible) and tries again and again. In the end he throws all scenes together, knitting those together with lose pieces of drama and that's it. So what you end up with is not a natural building of social storytelling structure, but some kind of chopped up salad in which you as the viewer must piece everything together yourself. And you are very lucky (or in fact unlucky, and I don't envy you if you do) if you manage to do so without compromising the viewing experience!To visualize what I mean a bit more Whenever the family is together or whenever Dunn and his wife meet there seems to be one topic on the table which doesn't really fully connect to anything they have recently been going on about, but it still advances the story because it is something new. The problem is that these advances are too big! Shyamalan tells you mostly about the waypoints in the story, NOT about the interesting and deep things exactly HOW a character came up with his ideas, assumptions and reasons. And that is something utterly too easy, a cheap way out and it is not real story telling. It is like reading the back of the book.

I just got done viewing my copy of NotC (again). This is the first time I've watched it since last year's So-Cal wildfires, and I'd forgotten how red the sky  was. It's weird how so cheap an effect is really effective to those who've seen the  actual thing (a sky that looks post-apocalyptic). NotC is full of that sort of thing. Creepiness, intelligence, and silliness when you  don't expect it. It's got a rhythm like free jazz, and for some people that's a  problem. For me, it's fun. I like a movie that keeps me on my toes, and NotC does that. The tone of the flick changes with the situations, and that's a good  thing. No one ever said comedy had to be monotone. In fact horror and comedy both rely on our fears, and it's really difficult to walk a successful line between  the two while giving screen time to each. Some people wrote complaints in their reviews without really understanding concepts, and then claimed their own misunderstandings as plot errors. For example, one person complained about the movie's disastrous title comet being  a thinly veiled reference to Halley's Comet arriving in 1986. Sorry writer, the  movie clearly states this is a comet that has been away for 65,000,000,000 years and even has a bit of dialog about how harmless Halley's Comet is. This  isn't to say NotC is error free, but it helps to pay attention if you don't want to be  confused. I've read several reviews where people complained about plot holes and inconsistencies, and I'm a little baffled. Didn't these people realize they  were watching an early 80's B-grade farce about two valley girl sisters who  manage to survive the apocalypse? What were they expecting? (Dialog spoiler this paragraph only.) NotC is meant to be ridiculous. It's meant to  have a few good creep outs, and lots of silliness. How else can you explain the  dialog of two brainy nurses who - due to slight mental incapacity - are unable to  remember if they were instructed to draw 30 or 300cc's of blood a day from some less-than-willing donors. The problem being that if they draw 300, they'll  just expire altogether. If the movie were intended to be serious, they'd have  notes. As it stands, they have silly, well-written dialog for a wholly unlikely  situation. (All clear!) I'm not sure if the movie's available, but I can recommend it to fans of sci-fi  comedy for a night of relaxed humor. Sci-fi fans in general will notice themes  repeated in newer films, and even some TV series. People who were in their teens and early 20s in the mid-eighties will probably receive it better.

Quite a number of commentators seem to take the view that hey, it's not a documentary, but I wonder whether their reactions would have been the same if the freedom fighter had been Palestinian (his father has been killed by the Israelis and now he's out to buy Stinger missiles to fight back against the occupation of his home land) or Iraqi ... I dare say that the reception wouldn't have been quite so sympathetic.  As it is, the movie stands for a time before 9-11, when the US position on terrorism was slightly less well defined, if not totally different altogether.But even taken as mere entertainment, this flick fails miserably.  Starting with the preposterous title;  then there is only one blood-guns-and-explosions action scene, at the very beginning (noble freedom fighters vs. the Forces Of Evil).  Next, both the good guy and his opponent are, ahem, good guys, which necessitates the introduction of some more bad guys to keep the plot moving  namely the weapons dealer (boy, didn't they ever try hard to make him look sinister -- I was already expecting a scene where he serves beer to some college kids without asking to see their licenses first) and Harrison's cop colleague;  actually, when he first showed up I thought that he looked somewhat sinister for a good guy --pock marks, greasy hair, Hispanic -- until a bit further in the movie it miraculously turns out that, naturally, he IS a baddie after all!  Director Alan Pakula masterfully rounded this off with some of the most nauseating cinematographic stereotypes in the book -- especially the use of quaint Irishy flutes full blast whenever the subject comes to Ireland, but I also found the scene where the two terrorists play war with water hoses quite memorable.  In a way I'd wager that because the film tries so hard to cover up its sympathies for the militant Irish Republican cause it derails so badly in the entertainment department.But like I said, this movie is quite interesting, if only for historical and political reasons.  Nowadays you it would be impossible to produce a movie which so blatantly justifies terrorism (now that the US have become the victim) or that portrays the British so badly (now that they have become allies #1).  Watch this as an example for how quickly attitudes can change.

Quite a number of commentators seem to take the view that hey, it's not a documentary, but I wonder whether their reactions would have been the same if the freedom fighter had been Palestinian (his father has been killed by the Israelis and now he's out to buy Stinger missiles to fight back against the occupation of his home land) or Iraqi ... I dare say that the reception wouldn't have been quite so sympathetic.

He is about to ask, Please, make me older so I can watch Scorpion King without censorship cuts. He rolls the coin in his fingers, and thinks best, Please, let me watch Scorpion King before they tainted the picture pit black.

I guess I'm a fan of hers because with the exception of Picture perfect I have enjoyed every movie I've seen her in so far.What surprised me so much was, this movie was not at all what I had thought it was in my mind which was- a typical romantic comedy where, in this case, girl falls for boy who is gay, doesn't tell him till end, he realizes he loves her too and they get married. I was quite wrong on that, girl does indeed develop feelings for male roommate but they don't wind up together and the characters' relationship is developed and explored in a very mature, sensitive, human manner. In fact all the characters and the development of all their relationships are interesting and realistic, and the thanksgiving dinner scene was particularly touching. This movie to me is a solid 8 or 8.5 and really goes to show not to make assumptions going into a movie-you never know what you'll like until you give it a shot! Good job by everybody in this movie and I'll add my vote to solidly recommending this flick. Wish I'd seen it years ago.

The most graphic part of the film is at the beginning, when a car driving down a barren road is pulled over by a couple of police officers. Rather then write a ticket for speeding they taunt them and shoot them. We don't really know exactly what happened, we have some idea that these officers are a little more than just consciencous of fast drivers, and that's what hooks us in. Two officers, Gene Hackman and William Dafoe, are sent into investigate, and once we know what they're investigating, there's the irony of the audience now knowing what's going on but the characters don't. Hackman and Dafoe have an interesting chemistry, I won't say good, because they start off in such distant alignments from each other, that there's no real partnering\/interaction at first. Dafoe is a by-the-book guy who's young and inexperienced and Hackman is a somewhat more playful guy who's from the area and tries to act like he's one of the guys when they interact with locals. There's an interesting power relationship between them, because despite Dafoe's inexperience and lack of street smarts, he's the senior officer on the case, but regardless of who really has more power between them, they don't really get anywhere  for a long time with this town. The drama is in a curious deadlock of the FBI officials saying, what happened to these missing people? where are the bodies? and the locals in the town saying, we don't know, we didn't do anything? why don't you just go back and forget about the case?, and the two parties here start acting like my senile grandparents who ask the same question over and over thinking that they'll get a different response. This would get kind of boring, except for the changes happening within Hackman's character who starts to become more passionate about what's happening as he befriends the deputy's wife, Frances McDormand, and just gets more and more p***ed about stuff. Hackman really was at the heart of this movie and McDormand's character really added a lot to the movie, as a more innocent and foolishly youthful woman than the roles she normally gets.

I also liked the poem sequence at the end though I guess just as many people will loathe it as like it I do admire the producers honesty in pointing out that much of this screenplay is invented and I do wish more producers would do this , a pity that those of us such as myself who had never heard of Chopper Read have no idea what bits are true and what bits are fiction though .

While it is rife with Capra's signature sentimentality and less-than-subtle storytelling methods, it is also very effective.  The story is one of a triumph of dogged persistence and idealism over the political machine.  It evokes the spirit of Norman Rockwell's Freedom of Speech.Jeff Smith (Jimmy Stewart) is a young, idealistic leader of a boys' group similar to the Boy Scouts, who is chosen, much to his surprise, to be elected senator. He is filled with hope and aspirations of his country's future, seeing his surroundings with wonder and amazement.  His only plan - aside from patriotic yet vague hopes - is to pass a bill in Congress allowing for the creation of a national boys' camp.  This, of course, earns him favor with boys all across the country, idolizing him and sending him campaign contributions - a nickel at a time. He meets up with his new secretary, the lovely yet callous Clarissa Saunders (usually just Saunders), played by Jean Arthur, who helps to write and introduce his bill.  However, conflicts arise when the proposed land for Smith's camp is the same site as the soon-to-be-proposed Willet Creek Dam.  Soon, Smith discovers an aspect of America he never expected - the puppetry of Jim Taylor, an extraordinarily wealthy tycoon who works his way into the innermost workings of Congress.In many ways, he represents an ambassador of sorts between the world of boys - filled with adventure, ambition and a certain irrefutable yet candidly simple logic, and the world of politics - filled with cynicism, bribery and self-interest. (in fact, aside from Jefferson Smith, just about every politician in the film is either corrupt or simply very stubborn and foolish).  Jimmy Stewart's portrayal of the young senator is so incredibly naive, boyish and filled with blue-eyed wonder far past the point of realism (at one point, he punches several people in the face), yet he manages to retain a certain charm.  Saunders notes that when he left for the Senate for, she felt as if she were a mother wishing him well on his first day of school.  Without giving away any details, despite the implausibility of the character this is one of Jimmy Stewart's best and most entertaining performances.However, the best performance in the film - beyond any doubt - would have to be Claude Rains's portrayal of Senator Joseph Paine.  Paine is a more complex and interesting character than the others, most of whom have rather predictable personalities and story arcs.  Paine, once Jefferson Smith's mentor and good friend, is forced to campaign against him.  He has been justifying his allowance of the Taylors' influence for years, and despite his basic good nature, he has learned how to play the game of politics.  He is a man who at times hates his job, but knows what must do and pursues it with everything he has - and Rains is utterly convincing in the role.Still, the film is far from perfect.  Many of the characters seem simple and hollow - as if they were merely the execution of the story's premise, rather than actual humans in a difficult situation.  Much of the film seems incredibly exaggerated and unlikely - particularly what happens to Smith's fanboys toward the end of the film!  Capra's basic filmmaking strategy is to bombard the viewer with emotion and inspiring, patriotic monologues.Ultimately, despite its flaws, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is very entertaining.  As long as the viewer doesn't take it as seriously as it seems to take itself, (and doesn't mind a barrage of stars and stripes) it is a very enjoyable and significant film.

While this is certainly true, what's often overlooked -- at least after only one run through the film -- is that it's chiefly a tale of God vs. Satan, and the war is there to set a perilous backdrop. No doubt, Platoon shows the Vietnam War was a big mistake, but being a fictional documentary on Vietnam is far from its purpose.The story is told from the point of view of Chris Taylor (solidly played by Charlie Sheen), a middle class kid who goes to Vietnam to do what he thinks is his patriotic duty. In the first ten minutes, Chris is shown in the uncomfortable jungle, struggling just to survive in the natural environment, let alone do any actual damage to the enemy. Quickly we're introduced to the well-known facets of the Vietnam War The lack of sense of purpose, the wraith-like enemies, the obvious prevalence of the uneducated and poor among the fighting grunts -- and, soon, we see how these factors combine to cause widespread low morale and some actions of more than questionable ethical value.Chris sees his platoon fragmented into two halves, each aligned with one of two men -- Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). These two really are the driving force behind the film. They both have nominally the same enemy (the Viet Cong), but, really, it doesn't take long to realize that Elias is Good, and Barnes is Evil (the enemy does not enter into the moral equation of this film, at all -- it's an outside threat, same as malaria-carrying mosquitoes or even friendly fire). I won't deny it is a very black-vesus-white relationship, but this polarity does not feel contrived. Elias feels the futility of the war and has respect for life; Barnes fights the war doggedly and has no compassion, period. Both are efficient soldiers fighting the same enemy, but really -- as is at one point aptly put by Chris Taylor himself -- they are fighting for the souls of the platoon members, as the outcome of the war is never really in doubt.Elias\/Barnes' hold on the platoon, and the viewer, is developed through several war sequences. A chilling scene takes place in a village, where our soldiers find no VC, but they do find a cache of VC weapons. The inhumanity of certain soldiers, including of Sgt. Barnes, is unflinchingly shown here. It leaves the viewer with an empty feeling that is hard to shake, reminding of the similarly empty look on a woman's face after she sees her son killed in front her.Elias doesn't take kindly to this kind of behavior. Elias and Barnes come closer and closer to open conflict, as Taylor becomes a veteran, obviously siding with Elias. Meanwhile, the fate of the platoon comes closer and closer to them, culminating in an explosively shot action conclusion. The end is dark, but morally satisfying.Don't watch this movie for the action. That's not to say it's not well shot, or unrealistic. On the contrary. It's quite convincing. But it doesn't show war as a fun sport, and it's never a question of good guys versus bad guys. There will be no cheering for the good guys or anyone else in this one. Stone succeeds brilliantly at putting the viewer into the middle of it all, and it's not a pretty sigh (and definitely not for the squeamish, either).On the other hand, if you want great acting, it's here. Dafoe and Berenger do incredibly well, with the incredibly good (and seemingly authentically sounding) script. Barnes is horrific as he challenges three men to kill him, drinking hard liquor out of the bottle. They don't make a move, and neither will you, though you'll hate him just as much as them. Dafoe is a ray of light in the dark as Elias. The cast is rounded out with many characters, all well played, and adding another dimension to the film.The technical aspects of the film are superb, though one never thinks about them much, as the movie is completely engrossing. The production values seem quite good, as well. The most stunning peripheral aspect of this film, however, is the music. It's emotional and draining, and used to great effect -- listen for the main theme as you watch the village burn.Watch this one a few times, and you'll likely be quite moved each time.
