I've lost count of how many times I've watched this film over the years but it keeps getting better with each new viewing and I can't help but notice new things each time I watch it. There's really nothing I could add that hasn't already been said about this movie but it's certainly one of my all time favorites and I'd argue that it's one of the greatest ever made. This movie has been called timeless by many people but I really can't think of too many movies where this is more true. I can't possibly see how this movie would ever grow old fashioned or out of touch because there's always going to be people who feel like the main character here. The most amazing thing to me is that the film perfectly captures how someone might begin to feel that they're worthless and I can't help but think that anyone who watches this movie will have a better look on life or themselves after watching it. I really can't think of too many movies that contain as much power as this one but I'd say that's why new fans are gained each and every passing year. The greatness of the film is certainly its heart but Stewart also deserves a lot of credit for his marvelous performance, which is certainly one of the best of his career. There are countless scenes in this movie where Stewart just nails it and I'm sure everyone knows the praying in the bar scene but there are many other great ones as well. On this viewing the scene on the bridge when Stewart begs for his life back hit me unlike any other time. There's also the scene in the bank where George has to bargain with the people not to take all of their money. Lionel Barrymore was always great playing bad guys and I can't help but think he's one of the greatest villains in movie history. The evilness that Barrymore is able to get through this character makes it among the actors best work. Donna Reed, Thomas Mitchell and Harry Travers also add great support. Every inch of this movie works flawlessly and that includes the sequences where George gets to see things as if he were never born. I think these moments contain Capra's greatest work as a director as the darkness and atmosphere he creates is so think and depression that it perfectly puts you in the mind frame of George. Then you've got that priceless ending, which ranks right up there with City Lights and Psycho as being the greatest for any movie.

They are one of my fears, and since that is so, I could not help but cringe at a few parts in this movie, and jump a little, whether I was really scared at any point through the movie or not.If I myself did not have an arachnophobia, I would have probably given Arachnophobia (ironic) a lower rating, because even though it manages to creep out viewers who do, which raises the intensity of the session as always, it is a movie that takes it sweet time on the story line and is spaced out along the kills, with maybe one scene I can remember of really high interest. Viewers who do not have arachnophobia will probably think it is nothing special, unless they are personally into movies that take their time, and even though this movie does that, it does it well. What there is to say about the movie is that a lot of the occurrences are very unbelievable, even though the main concept itself is highly believable, and a lot of the material is just way too far out there, but it is enjoyable, and it really does not get that boring, but the movie does get uninteresting to a certain extent, and some of the characters were faceless, except John Goodman's character, who was really my favorite character. All in all, it was still a good movie, and I recommend you view it whenever you have the chance if you think you could get into it.

We have the amazing (Wrath of Khan) and the absolutely horrifying (Star Trek The Motion Picture). There's also the average (ST Generations), mostly fanboy-pandering films which leave casual viewers out of the loop. Then, you have films like this, which have the double result of giving the franchise life and telling a great story. Perhaps it's no secret that good writing is what makes Trek more so than good FX, but when the two are combined in a spectacular manner, it is none the worse for the franchise.The story continues the saga of the TNG characters, but doesn't make it so obtuse as to cut new viewers out of the loop. They make it clear who is the villain, who is the hero, and provide all the background necessary to watch the film. In terms of continuity, it picks up three or four years after ST Generations, on a brand new Enterprise (NCC-1701E), captained by almost the same crew as the Enterprise-D. The film is fast paced, and jumps into the plot almost immediately. The stakes are incredibly dire and very close to home - the Borg have begun an invasion of the Federation, starting with Earth. The Enterprise is initially called away from the battle, but Picard disobeys orders and returns, using his experience with the Borg to destroy the cube attacking Earth.Within minutes, however, the Borg escape and travel back in time to 2063 - the year in which humans discovered the warp travel that allowed them to exceed the speed of light, and on the date when it was first tested - and brought them into first contact with the Vulcans, revolutionizing their society and ushering in the utopia of the Federation. Picard pursues them back, planning to stop their plans to assimilate Earth and change the future.The story is written by Jonathan Frakes, who is known for being a superb writer as well as an actor. He writes a great deal of character into his story, notably around Picard and the inventor of the warp drive, Zefram Cochrane, who has been alluded to repeatedly throughout TNG (and seen in TOS). Cochrane is portrayed by James Cromwell and is, far from being a visionary and a saint (as he claims the 24th century looks at him) is an alcoholic and driven by desire for money, not for the betterment of mankind. Yet, he changes throughout the film, and both Cromwell's fantastic acting and Frakes' script make it clear where and why he changes his views.Picard, on the other hand, is a different sort of character, who, with the invasion of the Borg, is finally beginning to truly feel the trauma that was done to his mind and body by being assimilated into their collective seven years prior. His infamous bearing and restraint is cracking heavily under the strain of his anger and desire for revenge. In one of the most famous scenes of the movie, a 21st century woman, Lily Sloane, confronts him with brutal honesty, comparing him to the obsessed Captain Ahab of Moby Dick, that the Borg have become his white whale. He succumbs to anger and realizes that she has been right all along. The dialogue, acting and complete honesty of the cast make his emotions seem realistic and terrifying.This is not just a good star trek film, it's a great film - period. For people who wish to be introduced into the Star Trek franchise, this is a great place to start, as it embodies what Star Trek is truly about. The battle sequences, based in land, space, and ship to ship, are at their best as far as Star Trek goes, and the movie's pace doesn't ever truly slow down.

I had borrowed some compilation CD's of festive music as well as some DVD's of various Christmas films that could just be run on the TV in the background on mute. Making an assumption I put this film on mute only to be told that my partner had never seen it and, not having seen it myself for several years, we stopped it as background and decided to watch it at the end of a day of cheer, relaxing, feeding ducks in the park, presents, food and, of course, wine. So it was we came to watch the Muppet Christmas Carol, perhaps with low demands but still unwilling to put up with anything that wasn't good or that dragged the mood down.I needn't have worried because, although it is not a perfect film, Muppet Christmas Carol is a real joy that delivers on several levels. Most surprisingly the focus is on the telling of the story &#150; this has its own modifications but it is surprisingly faithful to the story we all know and it is only really the use of the narrator that changes how it flows. This doesn't matter though because the film is surprisingly engaging &#150; it doesn't just TELL the events, it draws us into the characters &#150; or rather character. I make this distinction because that the film does this is almost entirely down to a performance from Michael Caine that is brilliant apart from one or two minor missteps that are more down to the material than him. It is not just that he plays it deadly straight the whole time despite being surrounded by puppets and people below him working them, it is that he plays it so very well &#150; this is a performance that is way beyond the standard expected for such a film. He holds so much emotion in his eyes and face that minor changes tell of a softening or hardening of his heart. It is in this area that the film engages and it is almost a shame that it is a seasonal kids film because his performance deserves more praise than it gets.In support of him, the film shores up with other aspects that you expect it to deliver in. In terms of laughs there are plenty but no massive killer or sequences that are built around a joke &#150; it is key that he humour never gets in the way of the plot or compromises Caine's part of the film. I say part because, although the narration device has its detractors, I did like it as an easy way of framing the story but more for the fact that it allowed for little comic moments that exist as part of the film without putting jokes into the actual Christmas Carol story so much as in the packaging thereof. The songs are rarely magical but are serviceable at worst and good at best &#150; Caine's singing is not great but his performance bought him a pass on that as far as I was concerned and credit to him for doing it himself. The various Muppet characters are all well received as on paper it is their film, even if reality it is very much Caine's.It seems weird to be praising a children's Christmas film because as a genre they are rarely the place to go for entertainment as they can be obvious, sentimental and not really much good outside of the season. However, thanks to the core work of Caine, this is a good film in its own right and the well-delivered humour and songs around this core only help and don't detract.

Making an assumption I put this film on mute only to be told that my partner had never seen it and, not having seen it myself for several years, we stopped it as background and decided to watch it at the end of a day of cheer, relaxing, feeding ducks in the park, presents, food and, of course, wine. So it was we came to watch the Muppet Christmas Carol, perhaps with low demands but still unwilling to put up with anything that wasn't good or that dragged the mood down.I needn't have worried because, although it is not a perfect film, Muppet Christmas Carol is a real joy that delivers on several levels. Most surprisingly the focus is on the telling of the story &#150; this has its own modifications but it is surprisingly faithful to the story we all know and it is only really the use of the narrator that changes how it flows. This doesn't matter though because the film is surprisingly engaging &#150; it doesn't just TELL the events, it draws us into the characters &#150; or rather character. I make this distinction because that the film does this is almost entirely down to a performance from Michael Caine that is brilliant apart from one or two minor missteps that are more down to the material than him. It is not just that he plays it deadly straight the whole time despite being surrounded by puppets and people below him working them, it is that he plays it so very well &#150; this is a performance that is way beyond the standard expected for such a film. He holds so much emotion in his eyes and face that minor changes tell of a softening or hardening of his heart. It is in this area that the film engages and it is almost a shame that it is a seasonal kids film because his performance deserves more praise than it gets.In support of him, the film shores up with other aspects that you expect it to deliver in. In terms of laughs there are plenty but no massive killer or sequences that are built around a joke &#150; it is key that he humour never gets in the way of the plot or compromises Caine's part of the film. I say part because, although the narration device has its detractors, I did like it as an easy way of framing the story but more for the fact that it allowed for little comic moments that exist as part of the film without putting jokes into the actual Christmas Carol story so much as in the packaging thereof. The songs are rarely magical but are serviceable at worst and good at best &#150; Caine's singing is not great but his performance bought him a pass on that as far as I was concerned and credit to him for doing it himself. The various Muppet characters are all well received as on paper it is their film, even if reality it is very much Caine's.It seems weird to be praising a children's Christmas film because as a genre they are rarely the place to go for entertainment as they can be obvious, sentimental and not really much good outside of the season. However, thanks to the core work of Caine, this is a good film in its own right and the well-delivered humour and songs around this core only help and don't detract.

He went through great lengths to make the film historically accurate. Though the movie is fiction, much of it is based on real history. At the same time, he manages to give the film a soul.It is not just historical events, blood, gore, massacre, bomb blasts and firearms, but the viewer genuinely cares about the characters and roots for the platoon section to make it and feels sadness by the horrible death of each soldier. Alongside the director and writer, credit goes to the actors for displaying a brotherhood where these ordinary men, strangers to each other, are brought together by a very unusual circumstance. War can have a dehumanizing effect where people tend to get carried away and conflicts arise between the soldiers. We see the men get more frustrated as their hope slips away every time they think they are near to finding Ryan when reality says otherwise. But, these men cope with it and move on further.In a particular scene when Private Reiben is about to walk away, Miller for the first time reveals his identity. His 'unknown' identity had given rise to a lot of curiosity among his soldiers but upon hearing that he was an ordinary school teacher, Reiben is able to relate to that and he stays. From then on, he sees Miller differently. Likewise with Ryan and Miller and Reiben and Ryan (in one small subtle scene).There are two beautiful scenes one takes place during a night, when the soldiers are chatting and they end up talking about their mothers. In this scene Wade tells his story as he slowly reveals how he wished he had spent more time with his mother. The next day his brutal death devastates the soldiers fueling their frustration while they are forced to stay in control. Another wonderful scene is when an Edith Piaf song plays on the radio. Upham translates the lyrics and this amuses the soldiers and they are drawn into the song allowing themselves a moment of calmness. It is such scenes that reveal the depth of these strong characters.Tom Hanks arguably leads the cast as Captain Miller who is like the elder brother of the band. This is one of his most restrained performances and he is great. But, his supporting cast members that include Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg and especially Giovanni Ribisi are at least equally excellent. Paul Giamatti makes a strong appearance. Even Vin Diesel, whom I normally do not like, shows signs of a good actor as he impresses in a small role.Spielberg makes remarkable use of Kaminski's cinematography, whether it is long shots, jump cuts or various angles. Kahn's editing is smooth. Williams's soundtrack fits the film. The washed out colour has a harsher and rawer effect that stresses on the brutality of the war. 'Saving Private Ryan' is not sympathetic to those viewers who prefer suggestive images because it is quite graphic and visceral.For me it was an overwhelming experience because I was so drawn into it. Many have criticized Spielberg for heavily manipulating the viewer's emotion. Well, I prefer this kind of manipulation rather than the kind of effect melodramatic tearjerkers have on some people.

Even Vin Diesel, whom I normally do not like, shows signs of a good actor as he impresses in a small role.Spielberg makes remarkable use of Kaminski's cinematography, whether it is long shots, jump cuts or various angles. Kahn's editing is smooth. Williams's soundtrack fits the film. The washed out colour has a harsher and rawer effect that stresses on the brutality of the war. 'Saving Private Ryan' is not sympathetic to those viewers who prefer suggestive images because it is quite graphic and visceral.For me it was an overwhelming experience because I was so drawn into it. Many have criticized Spielberg for heavily manipulating the viewer's emotion. Well, I prefer this kind of manipulation rather than the kind of effect melodramatic tearjerkers have on some people. 'Saving Private Ryan' is a magnificent film. It's one of the best and my favourite of its genre.

Almost 80 years on it's still highly entertaining and iconic; and one of the great films of the 1930's pre-Code era.Perhaps the greatest achievement of King Kong was in the deployment of ground-breaking special effects that not only brought to life fantastical monsters but also, in the case of Kong himself, created a creature that was genuinely sympathetic. The effects are obviously dated but do not get in the way of the entertainment value; quite the opposite in actual fact. The raw special effects give the movie a heart and soul that most recent CGI driven films could never hope to achieve. In any case, Willis O'Brien's stop motion animation is fabulous for the time and you do believe these creatures are alive.Having just seen this movie for the first time in many years one of the things that struck me the most was how explicit it must have been for the time. King Kong was released before the introduction of the Hays Code which dictated to filmmakers many things that were unacceptable. In a couple of scenes on the ship you can clearly see that Fay Wray is not, shall we say, wearing a bra underneath her dress; it may not seem like much to today's audiences but is certainly risqué in comparison to films released in the 40's and 50's. And as for the violence? Well it's pretty uncompromising in places. Kong gets involved in some fairly brutal acts. He rips the Tyrannosaurus's jaws apart, he mercilessly tosses men into the ravine, crushes others underfoot, takes a bite out of various others, trashes the primitive village and, perhaps most shocking of all, throws a poor woman to her death for no reason other that the fact she is not Fay Wray. The Brontosaurus gets in on the act too by eating various unfortunate bystanders. Pretty grisly stuff for 1933!Events slowly build up from scenes in New York to the arrival on Skull Island. Once at our destination, though, the film is non-stop action. The set design for the primitive village complete with giant wall is stunning. And the various monster attacks on Skull Island itself are wonderfully well done and pretty scary for a film this old. Once back in NYC there is no let up as Kong rampages through the Big Apple derailing a train and climbing the Empire State building for the unforgettable iconic climax. There isn't really a lot at fault here but, if I am being picky, the love story between the Captain and Fay Wray's character is unconvincing; although, to be fair, many other films from this period featured love affairs that look hopelessly unrealistic to modern eyes.Much more interesting is Kong himself. He is a fascinating monster. We are clearly expected to sympathise with him at the end - his protection of Fay Wray is quite touching. On the other hand we see him many times committing acts of unnecessary violence. A somewhat complex villain\/hero far removed from some of the one dimensional movie monsters that would follow in his wake. King Kong is a monster movie that works equally as a tragedy.

Trent is certain that is where Cane is & drives out there to prove it, however the fiction of cane's books & reality blur into one another as the terrifying things in the novels begin to happen for real including the end of the world & reality as we know it...Directed by John Carpenter who apparently calls this his third film in his self titled Apocalypse Trilogy after The Thing (1982) & Prince of Darkness (1987) & while I liked a lot of it an equal amount left me rather frustrated & unsatisfied, the potential for something special was here for sure but it doesn't quite work for several reasons. The script by Michael De Luca (who at the time was President of Production at New Line the company that produced In the Mouth of Madness) is very H.P. Lovecraft in it's style, ideas about evil forces from beyond reality, the end of the world apocalypse as it's engulfed by slimy monsters from beyond, all the Lovecraft references & the fact the majority of the story is narrated by a patient in a mental institute also comes straight from a Lovecraft novel. The first thirty odd minutes is rather good as the mystery surrounding Sutter Cane is explored & once the action shifts to Hobb's End itself the films gets weirder & weirder as fantasy & reality mix & lots of slimy monsters pop up all over the place. The twist that a very rational cynical man such as Trent is merely a work of fiction made up by Cane to bring about the end of the world is reasonable if a little uninspired while the final twist in which Trent goes into a cinema to watch the film we have just seen made no sense to me at all & ended things on a bit of a downer. The character's are alright although Linda Styles is a bit useless. The plot is interesting for sure, it's something different & tries to be mysterious, scary, gross & surprising & it almost succeeds but several loose ends & a plot that fizzles out as the film progresses stop it from being classic Carpenter in my humble opinion.Quite a lot of fantasy horror from the 80's & 90's did the whole blurring of reality & fiction & specifically focused on books the most popular of which were probably the rather excellent I, Madman (1989) & the not so excellent The Dark Half (1993) both of which featured killers from the pages of novels coming to life. There's some really stylish Lovecraftian imagery here with a wall of slimy tentacled creatures chasing Sam Neill being one in particular that stands out. The film has a few creepy moments, there's some impressive monster & creature effects on show although there's not really any gore. There's a good atmosphere & there are definitely a couple of unsettling scenes here but they are few & far between unfortunately. The town of Hobb's End is obviously a reference to Quatermass and the Pit (1967) in which the alien spaceship is found in a subway station named Hobb's End too.With a supposed budget of about $14,000,000 this was another box-office failure for Carpenter who just couldn't repeat his earlier critical or financial success he had with films such as Halloween (1978) & Escape from New York (1981).

It was about at that point that Gary Oldman's character was revealed to be a cop, and then the head scratching began. I mean, really, did he and his goons have to take out Mathilda's whole family over a drug deal gone bad? And when Stansfield (Oldman) is questioned about the massacre, he storms out yelling that he doesn't have time for this spit? What police force allows it's own to go renegade like that without stepping in? Then you have Mathilda (Natalie Portman). OK, I know we're pushing our kids like never before into a maturity they can't handle, but come on. Was anything about Mathilda believable? I can understand her wanting to get revenge on the scum that killed her family, but she was more than ready to go out and target practice using live rounds on joggers in the park. Who comes up with this stuff? There was nothing remotely believable about anything that occurred in the second half of the story, especially after Leon (Jean Reno) wasted the two cops right inside police headquarters. After that, it all became too absurd for comprehension.So then I call up this flick's stats on the IMDb, and it sits at #35 in the Top 250 of all time! What's that all about? That's just a total perversion of any kind of integrity in the rating system. This film is an escapist action adventure flick where one's sense and rationality is best left checked at the door on the way in. To give it the kind of adulation that most of the reviewers here seem to bestow upon it just makes me wonder what we all have become. It's not pretty.

People (I'm talking about the masses here)living prior to the 1950s did little psychological ruminating. These same people (my parents, relatives) found psychology and emotional upset distasteful. They were generations of people so affected by poverty, the depression, and war that they became people who didn't question much. The questioning was done by the upper classes and the educated. Most people quit school, got jobs and raised families without ever really figuring out who they were. Their dreams were rather simplistic rooted in the fact that their parents told them more about what they couldn't do than what they could. The thing that made men of the previous generations so tough, rough, scary was their animal behavior and their silence. Dirty jokes were the tonic they drank. Violence was always possible. When you take modern actors with their jaded blase attitudes and try to inject them into the past, it never works. If Woody truly wanted to reflect a period of time, he ought to not have acted in this one and not to have used his script. All the characters are infected by his voice. They are essentially all Woody. They become unsure, frightened kvetchers who stumble around telling everyone everything going on in their minds all the time. This does not make a drama. It's Annie Hall meets a lot of Woodies who pretend to be cops, clowns, murderers. It's like the Three Stooges playing Oedipus Rex. It doesn't ring true. Perhaps he needs a new stable of unknown actors who aren't in awe of him. His actors always appear burdened by their roles as though they are trying to just get through the lines. The whole film is a fog.

Often when one sees an old favourite many years later it turns out to be less enjoyable than one remembered but that wasn't the case with the excellent film.Walter Matthau plays CIA field agent Miles Kendig who quits when his new boss transfers him to a desk job. He doesn't do this by resigning but by shredding his file and heading to Austria where he meets up with an old flame played by Glenda Jackson. He also meets his old adversary, KGB agent Yaskov, played by Herbert Lom, who tries unsuccessfully to recruit him. He does however make a joke about Kendig writing his memoirs which he things is a good idea.Once he has written the first chapter he posts copies to several intelligence agencies including the CIA and KGB. His boss, Myerson, is less than impressed and decides to have him killed before he can cause more embarrassment. Of course before they can do that they must find him and he is always one step ahead of them, often letting them know where he is just before he changes his identity once again and moves on. At one point he actually rents Myerson's Summer house which inevitable annoys him even more.Just because this is a film about a spy on the run don't expect it to be like the Bourne series, after all is is a comedy and Matthau is playing an agent at the end of his career, not an ultra-fit assassin. The acting is good, especially from Matthau and Jackson in the two main roles. The only slight fault with the film is that there is quite a lot of swearing from Myerson which means parents might not want younger children watching it.

It is a real shame but the Directors Cut explains the story a lot better than the theatrical version ever did. The editing and cutting that became the Theatrical release really impaired the story and the characters and left everyone with the same clueless feeling about the overall package that is Alien 3.If you want a lot of guns, cool technology and colonial marines then watch Aliens by Jim Cameron, Alien 3 is more of an exploration of Ripley and her regression back to her normal self before she was mentally scarred by the events of the previous films. Her regression is short lived as (in true Alien style) there is a Xenomorph on Furion 161. You can relate to Ripley, she is a normal person (a Flight Officer profession wise) but a lot of what she used to be had been stripped away by the previous events. What you see in Alien 3 is a small glimpse of hope in her that things might be over.The prisoners of Fury 161 comprise of many talented British actors (not all British of course) who deliver exceptional performances (Charles Dance is a prime example). It was not to everyone's taste. They do however offer a gritty and well balanced malevolence to the whole film.If you want to fully appreciate Alien 3 you really need to treat yourself to the Directors Cut, this offers a better delivery of the story and also explains things in a lot more depth. There is still small room for improvement even in the Directors Cut of the movie (more notable the Queen Face Hugger the comes off the Ox, you see it from a distance however there was a large model made for the puppet and to be honest it looked amazing, you never see this).I still have to rate this film with an 8 though, I would love to make it a higher rating but the effects on the Alien itself are not the best. They literally used a puppet on poles and the result is excessively noticeable and lets the movie down.
