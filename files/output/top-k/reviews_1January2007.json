I couldn't believe it either, but this is one of those special films...It's clear from the start that Instinct thinks it's much more intelligent than it actually is. Sadly, it doesn't even redeem itself by being unintentionally funny.I know little of evolution and virtually nothing about psychiatry, yet the borderline unethical errors* showcased in this film tell me that I'm more clued up than the authors, who also demonstrate laughable comprehension of photography and border control in the 21st Century...and then there's the script. That Donald Sutherland can recite such atrocities with a straight face is testament to his ability as an actor.It's as if the writers had come home from a conversation with a deeply spiritual person (with very reasonable rates) feeling inspired with a message they simply had to communicate to the rest of the world. It seems that we are free spirits, born into cages we can't see past. I'm glad the good people of Hollywood revealed that to us in their own inimitable fashion.*Ah, that man appears to have wet himself. In that case, I think I'll devote my professional compassion to somebody who doesn't smell of urine.
