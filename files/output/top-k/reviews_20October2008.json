The film itself is worthy of all the accolades won; it sends the viewer on an immensely gripping psychological ride, with one of the best and most widely discussed endings you are likely to see in a Motion Picture. This was in fact, the very film that catapulted the legendary Milos Forman to stardom (he would later follow this up with the highly successful AMADEUS). The direction is simply superb as is the writing, and it is evident that Forman knew exactly what he wanted from the offset.Jack Nicholson wins his first Oscar in one of the best roles ever portrayed on film. The viewer will constantly question his state of mind relative to the other patients, and to the persons who society deem as 'mentally fit'. It is worth noting that Nicholson was only Forman's third choice for the lead role, after Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando. Maybe the Fates conspired that Nicholson would eventually get the nod, as it is now difficult to imagine either of the aforementioned topping Nicholson's performance.Louise Fletcher is equally brilliant, and the interaction and conflict between these two key personalities is one of the main selling points of this feature. The viewer will question intensely the ultimate motives of Fletcher's character, and this has made for one of the more interesting character studies of all time. Not to be forgotten is Brad Dourif who, in his debut performance, deservedly garnered an Oscar nomination. Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd also have small roles which they perform admirably well, but all this was before they really became famous. In fact, all the actors portraying patients do convincingly well in their portrayals of a wide variety of common mental illnesses, and the casting in this film was simply genius.For the entire running time of ~125 minutes the viewer is captivated, leading up to, during, and well beyond the ending, which is not quite cathartic but will no doubt impinge upon cerebral impulses rather than visceral. Personally, just considering the first 100 minutes or so, I would have simply stated that the film was quite GOOD; it is the ultimate conclusion that propels this film from good to GREAT; perhaps one of the best of all time.

And if anyone knew suspense back in the day, it was Carpenter. Like his other, older fare, Halloween is a slow-burning, tense little thriller that explodes at the very end, making it a movie worth repeating again and again. Thirty years later, despite the fact the film looks a bit old, it still holds up. Having seen it myself hundreds of times (really) I can say that there are still parts that remind me of why my first viewing of the film as a child was so memorable. Afterall, before Michael Myers was stalking his other sister or was driven by some mysterious cult, he was at his best stalking a group of babysitters and anyone who got in his path for no reason at all. We watch in an opening scene as Michael brutally slaughters his oldest sister and then looks completely emotionless when he is done. After fifteen years of being locked away in Smith's Grove Sanitarium, he escapes, steals his doctor's station wagon and heads to his hometown of Haddonfield to carry on his grisly killing spree.

The idea for this incredibly romantic story was apparently based on the book Bid Time Return, and the main locale in the movie is visited regularly by devoted fans (mentioned above). The real Grand Hotel,is a summer resort, open May through October, and is on Mackinack Island in Michigan.

Awesome things are done with reflections and shadows, and using the camera as a character's eyes. There is an absolute vulnerability to each person-- we are right there routing for them (or not, as the case might be); and because of the incredible attention to detail, we feel as though we've been transported to the period the characters are in.

Franco Zeffirelli had earlier made one of the great Shakespeare films, his Romeo and Juliet from 1968. (I have not seen his version of The Taming of the Shrew). Whereas his Romeo and Juliet was set against the background of the sunny Italian countryside, his Hamlet, in keeping with the play's Scandinavian setting, is appropriately cool and northern, although it was actually filmed in Scotland.Branagh's Hamlet was also filmed in Britain, but the two films are very different in terms of their visual style. Branagh shot his film in the depths of an icy winter against the formal grandeur of Blenheim Palace. The interior scenes, by contrast, are opulent and palatial; all the leading characters wear splendid costumes. (The film is updated to the nineteenth century, so that means crinolines for the women and military uniforms for the men). Branagh's aim seems to have been to contrast outward pomp and splendour with inner corruption and decay. Zeffirelli's film is set in spring against a castle on the cliffs above the sea. The exterior scenes are often sunny; the predominant tone is the bright green of the grass. In this case, however, the interior scenes are dull and claustrophobic; the predominant colour is the grey of the castle walls. The film is set in mediaeval times; not the high Middle Ages, which might have made for greater visual colour, but earlier, in the eleventh or twelfth century. (This period may have been chosen as this was the time when the Danish chronicler Saxo Grammaticus wrote the first version of the Hamlet story). The costumes, even of the royal or aristocratic characters, are dull and subdued; Zeffirelli seems to have intended them to reflect the mood of the characters in the play. I first saw this film in the cinema on the recommendation of my then girlfriend, but I did not hold out any great hopes for it, as Jill tended to judge every film solely on the looks of its leading man, a sort of female equivalent of those lust-stricken males who will solemnly insist, against all the evidence, that Pamela Anderson or Bo Derek really are great actresses. Mel Gibson was one of her particular heart-throbs, but at that time I regarded him principally as Mad Max and just could not envisage him as Hamlet. Well, Jill was right and I was wrong. Talk about coming to jeer and staying to cheer. Gibson is actually very good. He is not as polished as Branagh as a speaker of Shakespearean verse, but he brings his own rough honesty to the part. Like Branagh, however, he has little time for the traditional concept of Hamlet as indecisive, passive and melancholy. His Hamlet is vigorous and robust; his low spirits and disgust with the world are not the result of some innate character flaw but rather a natural reaction to the tragedies of his father's death, his mother's betrayal and the revelation that his uncle is a murderer. Of the other major characters, I liked Helena Bonham Carter as Ophelia (indeed, I preferred her to Kate Winslet). I also liked Alan Bates as Claudius. His performance is rather different to Derek Jacobi's in Branagh's film, but equally persuasive. Jacobi suggests that Claudius could have been a good man under different circumstances, before he allowed himself to be led astray by ambition and lust. Bates' character is a more straightforward villain, but one who is adept at hiding his villainy beneath an outward show of jovial good fellowship. Paul Scofield's Ghost is less frightening than Brian Blessed's, but perhaps more moving. The one major character I did not like was Glenn Close's Gertrude. In 1990 I still thought of her mainly as the bunny-boiler in Fatal Attraction, and her performance here did little to dispel that impression. To start with, she is nowhere near old enough to be Mel Gibson's mother. More importantly, Gertrude seemed to be fatally attracted not only towards her brother-in-law but also towards her son, embracing both with vigour and kissing them warmly on the lips. Close and Zeffirelli seem to have been heavily influenced by the idea that there is an incestuous attraction between Gertrude and Hamlet, something which has always seemed to me to owe less to Shakespeare than to Freud (or possibly to a misunderstanding of Freud), and which I think works to the play's detriment. The big difference between this version and Branagh's is length. Branagh's version is based on the full uncut text of the play and runs to over four hours, nearly twice the length of Zeffirelli's which, like Olivier's, is based on an abridged version. (The Fortinbras subplot, for example, is omitted altogether). Doubtless abridging the play in this manner makes commercial sense; three hours or thereabouts (Titanic, Lord of the Rings, etc) seems to be the outer limit of the modern cinema-goer's patience and Branagh's film did not do well at the box-office. Nevertheless, it is in my view the better of the two films, bringing out not only the full complexity but also the full emotional power of the play. Zeffirelli's version works well as a film in its own right, but it is little more than half of what Shakespeare actually wrote. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 October 2008","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" This was the first of two filmed Hamlets in the nineties, the other being Kenneth Branagh's from 1996.

But 'Sahara' is a first-rate World War II flick set in the desert of North Africa. Although the film itself is not particularly well-remembered, many of its elements and situations have gone on to be imitated and parodied countless times. We have a multi-national cast of characters (a la Hogan's Heroes, but twenty years earlier) and though the film is occasionally heavy-handed and preachy, it provides an interesting look at the interaction between various 'types' represented American and British, British and German, German and Italian. Everyone brings something different to the table in terms of local\/ethnic background, and many of their stories are entertaining. Even Bogart's two American tank crewmen are from very different parts of the U.S.- one from New York, the other from Texas. In fact, the only character in the film who doesn't wear his hometown like a badge is Bogart's (given the almost absurdly generic name, Joe Gunn); Gunn refuses to say where he's from, giving his point of origin as the U.S. Army. The story in 'Sahara' is of a small American tank and its three-man crew making their way south after a disastrous battle that apparently left the rest of the tanks in their contingent destroyed. Sgt. Gunn commands it and his main concern is keeping the tank running and finding enough water on the way to survive, especially after they pick up a few British soldiers, a Frenchman, a Sudanese soldier, and along the way acquire an Italian and a German prisoner.

It is however a terrifically unsettling experience with a stunning conclusion. The film is deeply shrouded in the style and attitudes of pop culture that were prevalent at the time it was made. So much so that much of the music sounds like Simon and Garfunkel type stuff, and the hippie attitudes of the late sixties seem to have been warped to fit pagan beliefs, or vice versa. But whatever the motivations, the finished product is definitely something to behold.Edward Woodward plays a sergeant from Scottland Yard summoned to investigate the apparent murder of a young girl in an isolated island community. Woodward has not even set foot on the land at Summerisle before he suspects the locals have something to hide. Though they are not outwardly hostile, they are hardly helpful with his search. And each step he takes on the island seems to reveal more and more strange behavior. The inhabitants are openly pagan in belief and practice. They make no bones about the fact that Christianity has long since vanished from the island, and now some kind of new-age translation of their old ways has taken roots. Christopher Lee plays the man in charge of it all in a role so delicious, he did it for free.Strange behavior aside, it is obvious that nobody plans on helping Woodward find out what happened to the little girl. At least that's what he's led to believe! Woodward is eventually able to piece together some clues leading him to believe she is still alive and will be sacrificed in a May-day ritual of some sort. He then sets out to search the island from one corner to the next to find the girl and get her out in time. That's his plan, anyway.....To read further would be a grave error if you have not seen this film. The ending was a big surprise for myself, and thankfully I did not read enough about the film to get any hint of the conclusion..... Well, to sum things up, Woodward learns that HE is really the one who will be sacrificed! The girl was never missing. She was just a means of getting Woodward out to the island to be sacrificed. He being a virgin, a servant of the king, and a couple more reasons that I cannot recollect, made him the perfect candidate these pagans were looking for. Since their crops had recently failed, they believed only a proper adult human sacrifice would appease their sun god and bring the crops back. Woodward is placed inside a giant man made of wood, and burned alive along with several animals. The scene was stunning, and for moment I was sure they'd either cop out and tell us it was all a big hoax, or someone or something would come along a save the day for Woodward. Though I felt very bad for his character, thankfully the film never copped out and filmed the ending we see.The Wicker Man is a very good film on many levels. The acting is very good from the main characters. Lee is always a treat, Britt Ekland is particularly stunning, and Woodward is top-drawer. He never really hit it that big in the US, and this is a shame. I've seen the guy in like three films, and he's really talented. Perfect for this policeman role. Breaker Morant is another fine one with him. The hippie music is a little odd, but somehow hypnotic so it ends up actually working. The story is not all that believable, and the final scene may not have been conceived properly in terms of blocking. Honestly, if I were in the cop's shoes, it would have taken one hell of a lot more than one guy to drag me into that contraption. I know, but where was he going to run to? Still, he would have resisted more than he did. Overall, I'd strongly recommend the film. And by all means try and avoid the remake. By all accounts it is terrible. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.

And I wasn't disappointed. I was only a clueless little brat at the time, what the hell did I know about cheesy Hollywood manipulation that makes you close your eyes (and nose) to the nonsense that surrounds the story of Spielberg's brown monster? However, many years later, and I discover that it's not all that it's CRACKed up to be. Plenty of stained holes in the script, and near every hole there's SBM sitting like the badly choreographed creature that it always was. A dumb kid called Elliott discovers SBM and goes all gooey and sentimental in no time. I didn't get it this time around why would anyone in their right mind want to go anywhere near this film?
