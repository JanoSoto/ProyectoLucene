His wife again a hostage, Christmas again , the same reporter from the 1st film, now a janitor Marvin is a helper instead of Argyle and so on. As far as sequels go, Die Hard 2 is excellent. Of course it isn't better than the first, but sequels rarely are. This film is like going to a circus you sit back and watch crazy stuff happen, laugh, cheer, joke, and just have a good time. Bruce Willis gives a great performance in the lead, we have some solid villains, and some brilliant action set pieces. I say check it out. I'm not one to subtract points for a lack of realism, or real world believability in films. Because of that, Die Hard 2 poses a very interesting case study for me. Real world believability is very difficult to not think about when watching this film. Why wouldn't the planes just reroute to other nearby airports? There are a bunch less than an hour's flight away, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, the three New York City-area airports, and so on. Why wouldn't they be able to call another close airport, or the Pentagon, or somewhere else nearby to have them contact the planes? They're near Washington, D.C., after all (don't forget that Dulles is 26 miles away from D.C., in Virginia, making it unlikely that planes out of fuel would begin dropping on the White House lawn). It seems like maybe this film should have been set somewhere like Salt Lake City, Utah instead. Why wouldn't they be able to show the runways through some other means, like a line of emergency or police vehicles with their sirens on? If the terrorists started shooting at the vehicles, or trying to blow them up, at least they'd be given an indication where the fire is coming from\/given their location. Just how likely would it be that there's a big storm in the area on the day when General Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero) is being extradited? How likely is it that he'd be extradited on Christmas Eve? Why the hell is John standing out on the runway in the snow waving a couple of flaming poles--just what does he think that will do? Die Hard 2 is still awesome movie and sequel to the first one for me. and I don't know why people are saying it is the worst one or why they hate it. I don't, I love it, not much a s I love the first one but I still love it. In 2005 was my first best action movie than the first one. What I love in this film is they show John McClain more as a human being. In the beginning at the airport when his car was taken away at the airport, the whole movie show's an actual terror the villains are more of a threat cause they're actual terrorists! The Action sequences are awesome, there is barely any Cgi in it, John McClane is again in another elevator shafts. I love the plot twist that was wonderful, the snow in the film, the mobile snow chase whit McClane was awesome. This film is not perfect It is good, it has some problems in it. Always enjoyed watching it. The problems for the airport I already mentioned, the most annoying to me was after McClane kills the henchman when he was saving Leslie Barnes is he pushed a terrorist of the latter and that latter tower falls on a terrorist you can see that it is a dummy from close that should not been seen from close camera.It is still my favorite movie mostly in the winter when it is snowing. The first movie was hug success, Renny Harlin's job by making this movie make it even harder for him, to find a good story, and make a snow because they didn't had any actual snow at the time it was really hard. I love it. The facts I love Chase with the Snowmobile, shooting with blanks on Carmine Lorenzo, fights on an airplane, double cross, John's jokes... The General Esperanza on airplane from Val Verde the same country was named in Schwarzenegger's movie Commando, John's shooting with snowmobile, than John's fight by the church.

There are those movies that you fall in love with from the first viewing and will always love. On the opposite end of the spectrum are those movies that you hate and no amount of retrospection will ever change that. In the middle of those two polar ends are, to be honest, the majority of movies. Now, I'll split those as well. Sometimes you find a movie that doesn't make much of an impression either way, but repeated viewings make you appreciate the nuances of the film. Sometimes, though, you find that you the more you watch a movie, the less it holds up, and your opinion of it dwindles as times goes on. This is my relationship with this movie.There are ardent defenders of this movie who will go to great lengths on the message board to insult any who dare to denounce this film. I would ask you to look at my rating. I still think this is above the average and better than a great deal of the horror films unleashed on audiences in the 80s. It's just that I've starting to see the cracks in the foundation of this as I watch it over the years.Let's start on the positives, which are what those defenders always want to praise. This movie (much like Carpenter's VAMPIRES later) does an admirable job of mixing the standard look and feel of a western film with a very horror-centric plot. You could, easily, remove the vampiric elements, give these villains black hats and still make this movie work as a western. In fact, one of the best things about the movie is the lack of generic vampire film lore. The word itself is never mentioned through the film. Though our monsters must protect themselves from sunlight, there is no garlic, no crosses, no coffins. This is certainly a much different breed of vampire.Lance Henriksen and Bill Paxton are the very best things about this movie, particularly Paxton's Severin. I find myself biding the time when he is off camera, sloughing through tedious romantic moments, in order to get to the meat of the movie and the mesmerizing presence of Paxton, who plays a vampire that is truly your worst nightmare. There is no suave sexiness and no pretty boy goth drama about him. He is a killer of man, pure and simple, and delights in his destiny. The scene that is usually mentioned is the slaughter in the bar and Paxton is the glue holding this scene together. The swift brutality that he shows to the patrons and the remorseless taking of life show a glee in killing that's hard not to appreciate in a twisted sort of way.The trouble with the movie, though, is that this band of vampires are really not the main attraction. The largest majority of his movie revolves around a farm boy, who meets one of these vampires in the opening scene. In typical Hollywood fashion, they fall in love after about 2 hours of knowing each other and begin to show the sort of deep devotion to each other that takes real time to develop in real life. She draws him into their world and it is this hero that is supposed to draw our empathy, he is the sole presence in this group who feels any sort of guilt and loss for the life he's left behind and the lives that he's required to take.I can't imagine that those scenes would have worked, in this movie, with any actors, though for immediate comparison I would look to THE LOST BOYS (it's obvious counterpoint) and the romantic relationship that develops in that movie. In THE LOST BOYS it is an integral plot point, but never feels like it draws away from the action itself. The romance in this one is painful to watch at times and draws away from any sense of tension and horror that is developed. The blame for this should be placed squarely on the shoulders of the two actors, Adrian Pasdar and Jenny Wright. It is no small wonder that neither had a very successful Hollywood career after this movie. They are not given great dialog to work with anyways and these two clunk their way through that dialog so much that we start hoping that Severin is just going to kill this kid off and end all of our misery. Perhaps in better hands these scenes could have worked, but alas we will never know. What we are left with is a movie with tons of potential, great plot, good cinematography and some great characters, that is ultimately killed by bad casting and wooden acting.

I don't know why Brendan accepted this role At least he had the sense to reject acting in the (cough) sequel. Sam Weisman should have been banned from Hollywood for his directorial work on this picture, but I suppose he redeemed himself, six years later, with Dickie Roberts, Former Child Star.This opinion is coming from a reviewer whose #1 comedy of all time is Ace Ventura When Nature Calls, so that should tell you just how bad George of the Jungle is There is only one joke in the movie, and it is duplicated relentlessly The protagonist swings on a rope or vine into a tree. I think it may have been done ten times in the first ten minutes of the movie, and it was about as un-funny as it was in the original cartoon Another person's misfortune and injury is not funny. It just isn't. At least, it shouldn't be. This is the type of insidious de-sensitization that is fed our kids, in its candy coating, unless we are good enough parents to help them see clearly and feel a sense of empathy and responsibility for those around them.Oh. Yes I forgot about the talking gorilla. Okay, there were two jokes, both gratingly dull.George of the Jungle has no redeeming qualities, and the only reason I am not giving it one star is because it has Brendan Fraser, who tried to do what he could to vitalize a horrible script.

I wasn't sure what to expect because of that controversial X-rating.

Now the film is about a close friendship that forged between two borderline criminals. How they go through life may not be endearing, but the friendship that is forged between them is very striking and moving. By the film's end, I have come to feel for the characters. The film does have a distinct overtone involving homosexuality, which is incredibly rare for a film in the 1960's. I think that is part of the controversy this film received. That being said, this is a fine work of art that stands to keep its hold in most influential films list.John Schlesinger's film is about a Texas hustler named Joe Buck who decides to move east to explore opportunities involving money and women. But he quickly realizes that New York City is nothing like his Texas hometown. He meets this outcast named Ratso who decides to show him how to strike it rich in the Big Apple. As the adventures start sailing, an everlasting friendship is forged between the two men.Now one thing that makes the film work the way it did was the outstanding performances. Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight have incredible chemistry with each other.

Beverly Hills Cop (1984) will always be the best and my all time favorite film that I love to death. That is why I just love the sequel much more and I have always enjoyed this film much better than the original film I did. Here Axel Foley,Billy Rosewood and John Taggart works as a team than they did in the first film. This time Axel Foley returns to Beverly Hills to help Taggart and Rosewood investigate Chief Bogomil's near-fatal shooting and the series of strange robberies alphabet crimes associated with it. Axel Foley comes back which he reunites with Detective Billy Rosewood and Detective Sergeant John Taggart.I love the Action sequences they are all great , humor , suspense , tongue in cheek, shoot'em up and is developed in agility and movement and for that reason is amusing. They are all great, there isn't any cgi in it. Whole cast did a great job. It is my all time favorite sequel to the first film. I seriously I love this film to death and I always have enjoyed so much. I still don't get it why all the hate for this film? The third film was really the worst in the series but I still like it and I will still watch it. Eddie Murphy did a great job as a Detroit detective Axel Foley, he did acted very well. Yes he was shouting one everyone I saw that, but there are things in the film that people didn't noticed. After his friend Captain Andrew Bogomil was shot he didn't hesitate to come to Beverly Hills and helping him out. He cared more about his friend than anyone else did. He hustle Maxwell Dent accountant Sidney Bernstein for $200 but, he later donated the money for Beverly Hills homeless people. He could spend the money but he donated. After he took Billy's vitamins and he bluff out the secretary in Beverly Hills Gun Club for money and he throw the vitamins away. he gave the money back to Billy for the vitamins he throw away! I thought that was very nice. Judge Reinhold as Detective Billy Rosewood did a wonderful job and a support in the main cast along side Axel Foley. He was crazy with guns which I love it. We see poster from Stallone's Cobra and Rambo First Blood Part II in Billy's apartment. I love how he was driving the car and caring so much guns with him. He had a turtle in his apartment awesome. John Ashton as Detective Sergeant John Taggart did a pretty good job as detective helping and solving a Alphabet crime he was awesome. Brigitte Nielsen as Karla Fry did a wonderful job as villainies and it was one of her best roles I have ever seen. Jürgen Prochnow as Maxwell Dent was fantastic villain much better than Steven Berkoff and Jonathan Banks in the first movie did. Dean Stockwell as Charles Chip Cain did a fantastic job as Dent henchman. Allen Garfield as Chief Harold Lutz was fantastic he was so load and funny I was keep laughing at his performance. The Last and at least the best small role that had was Ronny Cox I seriously I love him in this film. He doesn't do much but his still a good as Andrew Bogomil we finally found out that he has a daughter Jan and she is very beautiful. There are other faces in this film like are Hugh Hefner who plays himself, Chris Rock has a small cameo in it.Gilbert Hill as Inspector G. Douglas Todd and Paul Reiser as Detective Jeffrey Friedman also return from the first film and they also do have a few scenes in the film.In the original movie they were only in the beginning of the film than they were cut off from the rest of the film. I seriously think Tony Scott did a wonderful job filming this decent awesome Action Comedy flick. Beverly Hills Cop II is a 1987 action comedy film starring Eddie Murphy and directed by Tony Scott. It is the sequel to the 1984 film Beverly Hills Cop and the second installment in the Beverly Hills Cop series.Although it made less money than the original Beverly Hills Cop and received mixed reviews from critics, the film was still a box office success, making $153,665,036 domestically.I love this film to death!!! I love this film to death! it will always stay in my heart! I love the shooting, action, car chases, playboy girls everything in this film. I love Eddie Murphy! I also love the main theme for Axel Foley from Harold Faltermeyer and songs a Better Way - James Ingram,Shakedown - Bob Seger and Hold On by Corey Hart.10\/10 Grade A+ Studio Paramount Pictures, Eddie Murphy Productions Starring Eddie Murphy, Judge Reinhold, Ronny Cox, Chris Rock, John Ashton, Hugh Hefner Director Tony Scott Producers Don Simpson, Jerry Bruckheimer Screenplay Larry Ferguson, Warren Skaaren Story Eddie Murphy, Robert D.

I thought that was very nice. Judge Reinhold as Detective Billy Rosewood did a wonderful job and a support in the main cast along side Axel Foley. He was crazy with guns which I love it. We see poster from Stallone's Cobra and Rambo First Blood Part II in Billy's apartment. I love how he was driving the car and caring so much guns with him. He had a turtle in his apartment awesome. John Ashton as Detective Sergeant John Taggart did a pretty good job as detective helping and solving a Alphabet crime he was awesome. Brigitte Nielsen as Karla Fry did a wonderful job as villainies and it was one of her best roles I have ever seen. Jürgen Prochnow as Maxwell Dent was fantastic villain much better than Steven Berkoff and Jonathan Banks in the first movie did. Dean Stockwell as Charles Chip Cain did a fantastic job as Dent henchman. Allen Garfield as Chief Harold Lutz was fantastic he was so load and funny I was keep laughing at his performance. The Last and at least the best small role that had was Ronny Cox I seriously I love him in this film. He doesn't do much but his still a good as Andrew Bogomil we finally found out that he has a daughter Jan and she is very beautiful. There are other faces in this film like are Hugh Hefner who plays himself, Chris Rock has a small cameo in it.Gilbert Hill as Inspector G. Douglas Todd and Paul Reiser as Detective Jeffrey Friedman also return from the first film and they also do have a few scenes in the film.In the original movie they were only in the beginning of the film than they were cut off from the rest of the film. I seriously think Tony Scott did a wonderful job filming this decent awesome Action Comedy flick. Beverly Hills Cop II is a 1987 action comedy film starring Eddie Murphy and directed by Tony Scott. It is the sequel to the 1984 film Beverly Hills Cop and the second installment in the Beverly Hills Cop series.Although it made less money than the original Beverly Hills Cop and received mixed reviews from critics, the film was still a box office success, making $153,665,036 domestically.I love this film to death!!! I love this film to death! it will always stay in my heart! I love the shooting, action, car chases, playboy girls everything in this film. I love Eddie Murphy!

Beverly Hills Cop (1984) will always be the best and my all time favorite film that I love to death. That is why I just love the sequel much more and I have always enjoyed this film much better than the original film I did. Here Axel Foley,Billy Rosewood and John Taggart works as a team than they did in the first film. This time Axel Foley returns to Beverly Hills to help Taggart and Rosewood investigate Chief Bogomil's near-fatal shooting and the series of strange robberies alphabet crimes associated with it. Axel Foley comes back which he reunites with Detective Billy Rosewood and Detective Sergeant John Taggart.I love the Action sequences they are all great , humor , suspense , tongue in cheek, shoot'em up and is developed in agility and movement and for that reason is amusing. They are all great, there isn't any cgi in it. Whole cast did a great job. It is my all time favorite sequel to the first film. I seriously I love this film to death and I always have enjoyed so much. I still don't get it why all the hate for this film? The third film was really the worst in the series but I still like it and I will still watch it. Eddie Murphy did a great job as a Detroit detective Axel Foley, he did acted very well. Yes he was shouting one everyone I saw that, but there are things in the film that people didn't noticed. After his friend Captain Andrew Bogomil was shot he didn't hesitate to come to Beverly Hills and helping him out. He cared more about his friend than anyone else did. He hustle Maxwell Dent accountant Sidney Bernstein for $200 but, he later donated the money for Beverly Hills homeless people. He could spend the money but he donated. After he took Billy's vitamins and he bluff out the secretary in Beverly Hills Gun Club for money and he throw the vitamins away. he gave the money back to Billy for the vitamins he throw away!

Soon, his daughter is kidnapped. He is given a gun, and the picture and itinerary of a person, and told that if he hasn't killed that person in one hour and fifteen minutes, his daughter will be killed. The following takes place between 1200 and 130.......In the eighties and the early Nineties, John Badham was the king of really cheesy action movies that featured quite big name actors. The majority of them are not very good, but all of them are ridiculously funny, and, for reasons always unbeknown to myself, they are always worth going back to, for some strange sadistic reason.The gimmick in this particular movie is the fact that it's set in real time, and this just makes the film even more stupidly entertaining than it should be. The narrative is simple, as is the plot. Depp has to kill someone, or his daughter gets killed, and everyone he seeks help from is either in on it, or buys the big one.It shouldn't be as good as it is, it's all over the place, but it's really worth watching for three reasons.1) The film shows that Depp can do normal if he wants. His Watson is a thousand miles away from Jack Sparrow, and him not having to mug his way through a film is quite refreshing.2) The real time. It is a neat gimmick, and this was before the advent of 24. It makes the film that little bit more urgent. But then you have to consider the fact that Badham uses slow motion........and a dream sequence in real time. And Johnny Depp goes to the toilet more times in ninety minutes than Jack Bauer has done in his whole career.3) Christopher Walken. If you appreciate the actors career from 1990 to around 2003, you will understand what I mean when I say the this is him at his most 'Walken'. The little wink when he's angry, the little hunch head and smile when someone disagrees with him. And of course, the high pitch and sudden gravelly voice change he's best known for.It's all here.If these three elements were not included in the film, it wouldn't be anything more than a lethargic, below par, race against time thriller starring a career struggling Stallone or Willis, which is quite surprising as around this movies release, both said actors were struggling with their careers.Worth watching for all the wrong reasons.

They are films that define a genre, sometimes without meaning to. This 1954 Disney film of Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea is one such film. It is so thanks to an unlikely combination that has managed to help it pass the test of time beautifully despite the passing of more than sixty years since its original release.One of the biggest factors lies in its casting, especially of Captain Nemo. James Mason had already established his career in films like Odd Man out and The Desert Fox but it was with the role of Nemo that he earned cinematic immortality. Mason's Nemo is an incredible character a man who is equal parts genius and haunted by a past that hinted at but never quite revealed. There's a maverick nature to Mason in the role and he plays all of these elements beautifully. Yet there's a softer, more human side to his performance where he's almost a poet laureate of the deep, such as in a scene about half-way through the film where Nemo explains why he won't share his technology. It's a wonderful performance and a measured one that rises above the potential clichés of the genre.The rest of the cast is solid, if not always up to Mason's level. There's Kirk Douglas as harpooner Ned Land in a performance that varies from comic foil to action hero, a combination that's unlikely but that works for the most part though the comic elements stand up well for a film made six decades ago. Paul Lukas as Professor Aronnax and Peter Lorre as Conseil round off the four main characters and both do decently though it's perhaps Lorre, cast against type as an academic rather than as a villain, who comes across the better of the two. With the addition of the crew of the submarine Nautilus who have a few lines here and there, it's a solid cast all around.What stands out more than even Mason's Nemo is the production design. Decades before the steampunk genre had been founded, this film established much of the feel of that genre with its design of the Nautilus both inside and out. While Verne described something that was quite akin to the modern submarine, the production design of Harper Goff came up with something that was far more cinematic that combined Victorian style with more futuristic technology. Combined with some excellent costume design for the Nautilus crew, especially the diving suits, it's something that gives the film not only one of its biggest strengths but also perhaps its most iconic element.Outside of these elements, there's plenty of other things to recommend the film for. There's the Oscar winning special effects that bring Goff's visions to life for example. Using a combination of old-school techniques including some incredibly effective model shots, the film beautifully brings to life some great moments and visuals. The effects are perfect though as can be seen in some of the back projection shots used to illustrate what characters are looking at are a bit dodgy at times. Those instances are rare and, on the whole, the effects stand up very well for a film of this age.Then there's the combination of the script by Elmer Fenton and the direction of Richard Fleischer. Anyone who has ever read the original novel will know that, by virtue of it having been written as a serial originally, it's quite episodic with little in terms of an actual plot. Fenton's script manages to bring many of the incidents from Verne's tale together while also adding new elements here and there as well as changing the occasional piece of detail such as Nemo's hinted background. With this in hand, Fleischer's direction helps to keep the film moving throughout while also adding an occasionally campy tone that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.Elsewhere, the film shows some strong production values that illustrate some of the finest big-budget Hollywood work of the era. The cinematography for the film is fantastic throughout, highlighted perhaps by the sequences inside the Nautilus which are a sight to behold. There's also the excellently filmed underwater sequences which expertly mix together shots with doubles and inserts with the actors to bring sequences to life. The film's score by Paul Smith, while definitely a product of the era with a sound that only classic Hollywood could produce, serves the film well throughout, creating a strong sense of atmosphere from the early scenes aboard the US Navy warship the Abraham Lincoln to the underwater sequences which portray both the extreme beauty and the mystery of the deep.Nowhere though does this all of these elements come together better than in the film's signature sequence the fight with the giant squid. Combining performances from the actors, effects ranging from model shots to a full sized attacking squid as well as practical rain and lightning, excellent cinematography and the music of Paul Smith, the results were gripping for audiences both then and now as man battles beast with not only their lives at stake but the fate of the Nautilus as well. It's something that gives the film it's best sequence as well as presenting one of the most incredible action sequences ever produced for the screen.The term classic can be thrown around quite easily but there's little doubt that it can be applied here. From Mason's Nemo to iconic production design that continues to influence the steampunk genre, it's a film that has become iconic in ways that Disney and his filmmakers could never have imagined. As well as remaining one of the best adaptations of a classic into a film, it also remains as watchable today as it was then. If that doesn't make this a classic, I'm not sure what does. ","genre":null},{"date":"4 October 2015","score":"","review":" There are films that not only stand the test of time but become icons in their own right. They are films that define a genre, sometimes without meaning to. This 1954 Disney film of Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea is one such film. It is so thanks to an unlikely combination that has managed to help it pass the test of time beautifully despite the passing of more than sixty years since its original release.One of the biggest factors lies in its casting, especially of Captain Nemo. James Mason had already established his career in films like Odd Man out and The Desert Fox but it was with the role of Nemo that he earned cinematic immortality. Mason's Nemo is an incredible character a man who is equal parts genius and haunted by a past that hinted at but never quite revealed. There's a maverick nature to Mason in the role and he plays all of these elements beautifully. Yet there's a softer, more human side to his performance where he's almost a poet laureate of the deep, such as in a scene about half-way through the film where Nemo explains why he won't share his technology. It's a wonderful performance and a measured one that rises above the potential clichés of the genre.The rest of the cast is solid, if not always up to Mason's level. There's Kirk Douglas as harpooner Ned Land in a performance that varies from comic foil to action hero, a combination that's unlikely but that works for the most part though the comic elements stand up well for a film made six decades ago. Paul Lukas as Professor Aronnax and Peter Lorre as Conseil round off the four main characters and both do decently though it's perhaps Lorre, cast against type as an academic rather than as a villain, who comes across the better of the two. With the addition of the crew of the submarine Nautilus who have a few lines here and there, it's a solid cast all around.What stands out more than even Mason's Nemo is the production design. Decades before the steampunk genre had been founded, this film established much of the feel of that genre with its design of the Nautilus both inside and out. While Verne described something that was quite akin to the modern submarine, the production design of Harper Goff came up with something that was far more cinematic that combined Victorian style with more futuristic technology.
