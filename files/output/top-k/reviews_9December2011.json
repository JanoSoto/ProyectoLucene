[{"date":"9 December 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" There are a few Disney movies that have been favourites of mine and each one is part of a group of movies I can't really separate. They all get the highest rating from me and they are all as good as each other in different ways. Pinocchio is one of those movies.It's the tale of a wooden puppet who is given the gift of life by The Blue Fairy but then has to prove that he deserves the chance to become a living boy made of flesh and bone instead of just wood. He has a conscience in the shape of Jiminy Cricket, a father figure in the shape of his creator Geppetto and a couple of animal friends in the shape of Figaro the cat and Cleo the goldfish. He also has temptation put in his way in the shape of the wily and ironically named Honest John (AKA J. Worthington Foulfellow). The whole story is one long rite of passage that takes in lessons in honesty, a dark and dangerous time unsupervised on Pleasure Island and a big, nasty whale.Perhaps it's the better blend of humour and catchy songs with adorable moments throughout that has always made Pinocchio one of my favourite Disney movies or, more likely, perhaps it's the technical aspect alongside the fact that it's really a film all about an innocent child learning about the world around him and making mistakes along the way. It's the innocence of youth that leads us to do these things, it's curiosity and a sense of invulnerability as opposed to any devious scheming of malicious forethought (like the time my mother trusted me on my own one evening, I must have been about 12-13, and came back early to find that I'd put too much paper into our coal fire and bits had flown out and landed on the carpet, where I was frantically stamping them all out - boy did I get a spanking that evening).It also helps that all of the characters in Pinocchio are memorable for one reason or another. The main character is sweet and likable, despite making many mistakes. Jiminy Cricket is amusing despite being the voice of reason and the one trying to keep our boy on the straight and narrow. Geppetto is a caring father figure who deserves everything turning out well so that his wish can come true. And the villains of the piece are shady and nasty enough, while also having a certain, slick charm.As is often the way with these movies, there are one or two scenes that may prove to be a little bit too scary for younger viewers. Monstro the whale is an intimidating figure and is involved in some exciting scenes but, beforehand, the dark secret of Pleasure Island is something poised perfectly between entertainment for children and outright horror. Go back and watch it again if you've forgotten how scary it gets.There are a multitude of directors and writers involved in this one though the original story was written by Carlo Collodi (AKA just Collodi). I may be doing the people involved a disservice by not mentioning them all individually but this is a real team effort that produces a superb end result, a classic animated movie full of classic songs such as When You Wish Upon A Star, Give A Little Whistle, I've Got No Strings and more.

Many of them have been some strong box office hits. Well here's another film that'll blow your socks off. Atlantis the Lost Empire is visually a sight to behold. Why? Mostly because of its action sequences. There are so many different action sequences that'll keep the viewer staring at the screen because everything is done differently from Disney's previous films.Note for any Disney fan, this movie contains a good amount of action\/violence. If you check out the MPAA rating, you will see why. It is actually pretty violent for a Disney movie. That's just an FYI for any viewer. Going back to what I was saying though, the action scenes are quite interesting because some scenes look like they're close to 3D. Of course they don't look 3D to the point of coming out of the screen but the way the pictures flow is so smooth and well developed that it looks 3D.The story revolves around a wimp named Milo Thatch, played by Michael J. Fox looks to find the lost city of Atlantis. Fox was the perfect pick for Milo Thatch because his voice does not sound that authoritative. It is not until Preston Whitmore voiced by John Mahoney, tells him how he lost a bet to Thatch's grandfather where he must fund the exploration of Atlantis.From here this sets up an introduction to a whole list of voice actors that do a magnificent job in making their characters come to life. To name a couple; James Garner, Leonard Nemoy, Don Novello and Claudia Christian all play characters that resemble them in some way. This is another strong feature to this movie. The voice characterizations are done perfectly. I have to say that my favorite character from this movie was Vincenzo Santorini (Don Novello). Novello uses his voice from Father Guido Sarducci to make this character work, and I will say that he is what makes up most of the comedic parts in this movie. For example Milo Thatch is showing some civilians how to start a carp shaped vehicle of some sort. Novello's character then asks, Hey Milo, you got something sporty? You know, like a tuna. I couldn't stop laughing after that moment for about 5 minutes.Although it is one of Disney's more violent renditions, it pleases with eye opening visuals and fantastic voice-overs. With this at hand, Disney has yet again created another fun piece of film work.

They usually review all of the films released during the week and it seems that the Corrupter missed out, which is really annoying. Anyway, knowing that my tastes generally diverge greatly from those of reviewers, they would probably have given it a one star and labelled it as a pointless movie with lots of violence. This I would object to because Chow Yun Fat is an absolutely brilliant actor and most of the movies that I have seen that he has been in I really enjoy. Okay, Hard Boiled was little more than a huge gunfight through a hospital, but it was still a great movie.Chow Yun Fat is a highly decorated cop in New York's Chinatown. One day a white cop joins up, much to the annoyance of the other cops in the Asian vice squad as they are Asian and a white man does not know how Chinatown runs. It seems that this new cop is an eager and naïve boy who wants to change Chinatown, but as Fat says, you don't change Chinatown, Chinatown changes you. The new cop is portrayed through the movie as being the epitome of innocence caught in the middle of a dangerous a violent world that is Chinatown. The movie opens with a shop exploding and then the members of the Fookanese Dragons, a gang trying to take over from the ruling Tong gang, kill the owner of the store. This violence is contrasted with the almost innocent life of the white cop, who we then learn has a father who is in a lot of trouble with the mafia due to gambling debts.There are two themes that run through this movie, that of shattered hope and that of corruption even the most honoured and respected people have a corrupt side, while even the most corrupt can be capable of huge amounts of good. This is in contrast with Divorcing Jack where the corrupt are trying to create peace, only to have their corruption exposed and the peace being shattered. In the Corrupter, the corrupted are sought after, but even with the evidence to expose the corrupted, it is put aside for they are very much capable of performing great deeds.I thought that this movie was going to be predictable. It is not. As soon as you learn that the white cop is in internal affairs working to expose Fat's corruption, we expect then to turn on each other and begin to fight. The movie is not that shallow. As we remember from the quote made you don't change Chinatown, Chinatown changes you. The internal affairs officer has a purpose but the corruption then seeps into even his most resolute honour. The FBI are portrayed as rather nasty individuals, though they are simply obsessed with their job, and they hide themselves away behind desks, coming out only to claim fame for somebody else's bust.Internal affairs isn't much liked here, but we do sympathise for the white cop because he has experienced what it is like on the street and he is as affected by it as everybody else. He is there to collect evidence against Fat, but in reality he finds himself becoming more closer and loyal to him, when in the end Fat chooses not to shoot but to move to save his life. One cannot expect to move into Chinatown and change everything - rather they need to become a part of it, accepted by it so that the evil may be rooted out and destroyed.The main crime here is slavery. This is where the shattered hope theme comes in. Asians are illegally imported into New York for a price, and then the price is jacked up forcing them to work as prostitutes. Those who refuse are simply killed and dumped into trash cans. It makes one think about the whole idea of America being a better place. They come out to America (and Australia) expecting a better life but find themselves trapped on the streets with no money and having to degrade themselves by selling their bodies to people who simply want to abuse them. This is not the better life that they hoped for.We may all snarl and growl at criminals, but what many of us forget is that this is a harsh and uncaring world, and some people are thrown into situations which they do not know what they are doing and once they are there, they can never get out again. Drug use is the most common example, for they can find themselves without money and jobs and desperate for the drug and thus they must resort to violence to get it. In a way we should not be hating them and calling for them to be locked up in gaol. The true villains are really very few. Many of the criminals are foolish or simply caught up in something that they never expected to land up in. As such we should be helping them not causing them to be cast out.I have digressed from the movie, but we do see are very dark and miserable world here. A world where idealistic youths can't change. This is a real world with real problems that simply cannot be solved by locking people up or even by shooting them.

Yes, we can dream with a man that has knives for fingers a la Freddy Krueger, or we can also be scared of going inside the woods because maybe there's a Blair Witch Project around or a Jason Vorhees just behind our backs that will kill us with a machete, but what it's really scary is when you live a horror story inside your own house with the ones you care about and you're afraid of your own uncle for example.The boogeyman is real and you found it is a quote from House of a 1000 Corpses, but it completely translates into this shocking piece of cinema.Once were Warriors is the story of Beth, a woman who is married with a guy that drinks a lot, and happens to be possessive and abusive, that's why I only drink on special occasions. The awful part is THIS is a real horror story that many women live on a daily basis.The movie has scenes of extreme violence and the acting of Rena Owen, who plays Beth, is great, thanks to a screenplay penned by a woman which has a result a multi-layered character. On the other hand, although I hated the character of the abusive husband, played by Cliff Curtis, sometimes it felt a little bit overacted, but that's just me. Beth Reminded me of Sarah Connor at times and the scenes inside the bar sometimes made me think about The Terminator and the famous scene where the T-800 is looking for Sarah.I wish this movie was in 3D because I wanted to strangle the husband every time he was on screen, I mean it, he's one of those bad guys you just want to see burned and tortured at the end of the flick, but i wont spoil nothing to you because IMDb can burn me and that would be a shame.The directing is great and the way they present the characters in the first five minutes of the film makes me wonder if Quentin Tarantino is a fan of this film, because 10 years later Kill Bill used similar techniques on this particular element.In a nutshell this is a real horror movie, a great date flick (your girl will squeeze you to death) and one of those movies that really helps to create a moral conscience towards the evil that surrounds us in the real world and the nightmare lots of families live inside their own houses.This one will haunt you after you watch it!

Beth Reminded me of Sarah Connor at times and the scenes inside the bar sometimes made me think about The Terminator and the famous scene where the T-800 is looking for Sarah.I wish this movie was in 3D because I wanted to strangle the husband every time he was on screen, I mean it, he's one of those bad guys you just want to see burned and tortured at the end of the flick, but i wont spoil nothing to you because IMDb can burn me and that would be a shame.The directing is great and the way they present the characters in the first five minutes of the film makes me wonder if Quentin Tarantino is a fan of this film, because 10 years later Kill Bill used similar techniques on this particular element.In a nutshell this is a real horror movie, a great date flick (your girl will squeeze you to death) and one of those movies that really helps to create a moral conscience towards the evil that surrounds us in the real world and the nightmare lots of families live inside their own houses.This one will haunt you after you watch it!

Yes, we can dream with a man that has knives for fingers a la Freddy Krueger, or we can also be scared of going inside the woods because maybe there's a Blair Witch Project around or a Jason Vorhees just behind our backs that will kill us with a machete, but what it's really scary is when you live a horror story inside your own house with the ones you care about and you're afraid of your own uncle for example.The boogeyman is real and you found it is a quote from House of a 1000 Corpses, but it completely translates into this shocking piece of cinema.Once were Warriors is the story of Beth, a woman who is married with a guy that drinks a lot, and happens to be possessive and abusive, that's why I only drink on special occasions.

Hit it. - Jake.Director John Landis can make a great movie out of the most simplistic premises. After working with the late John Belushi on National Lampoon's Animal House in 1978, he returns to give us the funny, satirical, wickedly hilarious Blues Brothers. At first glance, the blend of music and comedy may throw many off, but if you're willing to go back to a time when movies were movies, The Blues Brothers is quite a throwback.The film's greatest accomplishment stems from its unlimited energy and desire to have fun. Jake and Elwood (played by Dan Akroyd and John Belushi) are one of the most enigmatic duos who ever made it on the big screen, and provide inseparable chemistry especially when at the mic. Even when they aren't at the mic, they are either doing some of the funniest fight sequences or claiming to yet another strange they're on a mission from God.A formal storyline is almost nonexistent. It's best to just go along for the ride. After getting out of the big house for an armed robbery, Joliet Jake is forced by his brother Elwood to go see a nun at their old home. They both learn that the orphanage will be closed if they do not pay their dues; $5,000 in property taxes. Ultimately, Jake gets the genius idea to reform their old rhythm and blues band. From there on out spawns a sea of insanity and a never-ending line of one liners.The Blues Brothers is lengthy and about twenty minutes could've been set on the scrap floor. But the execution is near perfect. There are two car chases that could very well rank in some of the best ever executed in film. Police cars topple each other, one after another, and the film knows when to start and when to end them.Fun not only stems from the enigmatic protagonists, but the extremely well acted music numbers.

Like a great book, Annie Hall demands your full focus to analyze and understand just what is being said. Recently the thought that I want to be a writer has popped into my head, and no one does writing, directing and acting better than Woody Allen.Annie Hall is about the relationship between cynical Alvy and ditzy Annie. While the film is a rom-com, it's more of a rom-com*. The * is because it's darkly funny, and the level of romance goes up and down like a roller-coaster. It's very honest, there's no closed doors in our viewing of the relationship.Annie Hall came very close to getting the Oscar Big 5, only losing the Best Actor, and while I haven't seen the winner, it must've been a good contest.

The movie involves several officers in the U.S. Air force with the action being divided between the war room of the Pentagon and a nuclear-armed B-52 war plane. The story begins with General Jack Ripper(Sterling Hayden), who is clearly not in control of his mental faculties, giving the order to a squadron of B-52 fighter jets to mount an attack on Russian soil based on paranoid thoughts he has of the Russians putting fluoride in the liquids Americans consume. His assistant, Captain Lionel Mandrack (Peter Sellers), originally thinks the orders are a drill but upon finding out the attack is truly going to take place, attempts to stop it. Meanwhile back at the war room,President Merkin Muffley (also Peter Sellers) warns the Russian president of the impending attack that he is helpless to stop (he doesn't have the code) and they argue over insignificant things instead of focusing on the huge problem of the bomb. General Buck Turgidson(George C. Scott), who is present at the meeting, relays information about the impending attack and tries to sway the president to take his advice, which is centered on his mistrust of the Russians. As time goes on, the war leaders call upon Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers again)who is the science adviser to the president and a former Nazi for recommendations on the situation. His thoughts are to hide underground with ten women to one man in order to perpetuate the world again after it is destroyed. All the men find this most agreeable. Eventually,Captain Mandrack is able to decipher the code from some papers he comes across on General Ripper's desk and calls in a stop order to the B-52 squadrons. One bomber plane, piloted by Major King Kong (Slim Pickens),does not receive the orders and while straddling a bomb as he tries to fix a jammed cargo door, suddenly finds himself riding the bomb as it hurdles toward earth. Of course the Russians are not happy with this new development and proceed to detonate a secret doomsday bomb they have created, which in turn annihilates the world.Dr. Strangelove makes light of a concern that most Americans keenly felt during the years of the cold war with the Russians. It was a welcome comic relief which helped people to put into perspective the fears they felt during that time. If you could laugh at it, it didn't seem as bad. Peter Sellers was very convincing in his triple role especially since I didn't even realize that he was playing the role of President Muffley too until the end of the movie. Peter Sellers played warring personalities as President Muffley and Captain Mandrack with their intense seriousness as opposed to the unfocused, goofiness of Dr. Strangelove.This contributed to the theme which focused on making light of a serious situation. A technique that stood out in the movie was the use of motifs. At different intervals throughout the movie, the word peace would appear on posters and papers. This irony contrasted sharply with the war scenes that were going on all around them and also related to the theme by helping the viewers to understand that peace is highly desired even in the midst of all our suspicions and insecurities. Black and white, while not always the viewer's first choice, was very effective for this film. It immersed the audience in the dark world that was war and lent itself to the satirical nature of the theme.Another darkly humorous movie is Young Frankenstein which was also filmed in black and white. Its theme focuses on making light of the fears surrounding monsters instead of war; however both films help viewers to see their fears for what they are. As long as we have fears to deal with in our lives, films such as Dr. Strangelove will come as a welcome relief. After all, laughing at our fears is not so uncommon.

Scott), who is present at the meeting, relays information about the impending attack and tries to sway the president to take his advice, which is centered on his mistrust of the Russians. As time goes on, the war leaders call upon Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers again)who is the science adviser to the president and a former Nazi for recommendations on the situation. His thoughts are to hide underground with ten women to one man in order to perpetuate the world again after it is destroyed. All the men find this most agreeable. Eventually,Captain Mandrack is able to decipher the code from some papers he comes across on General Ripper's desk and calls in a stop order to the B-52 squadrons. One bomber plane, piloted by Major King Kong (Slim Pickens),does not receive the orders and while straddling a bomb as he tries to fix a jammed cargo door, suddenly finds himself riding the bomb as it hurdles toward earth. Of course the Russians are not happy with this new development and proceed to detonate a secret doomsday bomb they have created, which in turn annihilates the world.Dr. Strangelove makes light of a concern that most Americans keenly felt during the years of the cold war with the Russians. It was a welcome comic relief which helped people to put into perspective the fears they felt during that time. If you could laugh at it, it didn't seem as bad. Peter Sellers was very convincing in his triple role especially since I didn't even realize that he was playing the role of President Muffley too until the end of the movie. Peter Sellers played warring personalities as President Muffley and Captain Mandrack with their intense seriousness as opposed to the unfocused, goofiness of Dr. Strangelove.This contributed to the theme which focused on making light of a serious situation. A technique that stood out in the movie was the use of motifs. At different intervals throughout the movie, the word peace would appear on posters and papers. This irony contrasted sharply with the war scenes that were going on all around them and also related to the theme by helping the viewers to understand that peace is highly desired even in the midst of all our suspicions and insecurities. Black and white, while not always the viewer's first choice, was very effective for this film. It immersed the audience in the dark world that was war and lent itself to the satirical nature of the theme.Another darkly humorous movie is Young Frankenstein which was also filmed in black and white. Its theme focuses on making light of the fears surrounding monsters instead of war; however both films help viewers to see their fears for what they are. As long as we have fears to deal with in our lives, films such as Dr. Strangelove will come as a welcome relief. After all, laughing at our fears is not so uncommon. Often all you need to turn a tragedy into a comedy is time and a little satire.

This movie is 14 years old as I write this (2011, in case you don't pay attention the date stamp). I fished it out of the $5 movie bin at Walmart this evening, choosing it for viewing because it has some big-name actors in a big-budget sci-fi movie, thus beating out Schwarzenegger's Commando and Dickie Roberts Former Child Star. It came with two DVD disks, the second disk for special features.I'll begin by pointing out the positive. The movie has aged well. The cinematography is top-notch, all the lighting, sound, props and special effects look great (to me, a completely untrained couch potato). This positive is one factor that helped me get through the movie, despite my growing irritation with it. The other was the hint that maybe I would be able to see attractive female nudity.Unfortunately, the plot is asinine. Almost all horror movies have asinine plots, so had I known ahead of time this is supposed to be a horror movie, I might have not expected so much from it. Now I've read a few of the other negative reviews of this movie, and I can see I'm not the only person who recognizes the obvious. Virtually nothing that happens in this movie has any business being in this movie. I get angry every time I think about it. So much of the plot is perfunctory climax, bad things happening on cue, and so obvious, because EVERY SINGLE HORROR MOVIE HAS THE SAME STORY ARC! Some people like cheesiness, but this goes so much deeper than even cheesiness could describe.It has nice props. I liked the props. I need to think about that for a little bit, until I feel better. Nice props, even though it seems silly that the living quarters look like the heart of a tokamak.Oh, there is some female nudity in it. In the first half of the movie, we get to see a woman's bare nipple for about 0.25 seconds. I spent the next half-hour wondering why the producers even bothered putting a naked woman in the movie if that was all they were going to show. We spend more time looking into her eyeless eye sockets as she speaks to us in a calm voice. Eventually, Sam Neill's character forces the camera to lock onto those same bare breasts for a minute or so. Visually, nothing else is happening. Then, we go back to the eyeless eye sockets.The movie attempts to introduce tension by the perfunctory personality clashes between crew members, particularly against the new person aboard. The new crew member designed a ship (the Event Horizon) that has been lost for several years, but now has reappeared. This crew was sent to find out what happened to the Horizon. To build this tension, in one scene, the designer shows complete disregard for another person's personal property as he attempts to explain how the ship he designed operates; so in another scene, a crew member damages the ship he built. Let's compromise the integrity of the ship we are trying to rescue, so we can even our petty score! Anyway, nice props. Big name stars. Some glimpses of a woman's bare breasts. The Planet Neptune swirling below. Oh, wait... somehow, the Event Horizon is orbiting Neptune *inside* her upper atmospheric cloud bank, in clouds so dense that she can't even be seen until the rescue ship almost runs into her. So, actually, the Planet Neptune, swirling all around.If you have any regard for scientific accuracy, you may resent this movie intensely much. If you care about logical motivations, the movie may annoy you. If you value intellectual, thoughtful stories, this movie may drive you mad.Of course, there is eventually blood everywhere. Blood and gore and horrific things. People getting bumped in the head. Eyes being dug out of sockets. Sharp, spiky things. Dead people. Age-inappropriate children in a Rated R movie, causing havoc.

Actually, I don't think political thriller is the exact title that one would use for this film, but I think that it is the closet description that I would give it. Anyway, it is a film set on the brink of world war III. A mad Russian general has captured a military base when the rebellion in Chechnya spilled over into neighbouring republics. Capturing the base he then made a threat that he was going to launch missiles at the United States so their subs are sent out. The situation reaches a point where they are about to launch the missiles so the US orders a nuclear strike. But a couple of minutes later another message is sent out but the sub receives only half of it which leads to a conflict between the captain and the executive officer as to what course to take. The captain wants a nuclear strike while the XO wants to confirmation of the orders.This leads to a couple of interesting things. The first thing that raises is that even with the collapse of communism in Russia and the end of the cold war does not mean the end of the threat of nuclear war. If a mad dictator like Hitler were to gain control of Russia, even though it is little more than a third world country, it still has a military force that can seriously threaten the United States and the world. It also has a lot of nuclear weapons meaning that a very anti-US dictator could still start World War Three. In fact, they say in a mess hall meeting they discuss the fact that the US is the only nation to have ever used an atomic weapon in war and there are a lot of countries that really want to get back at them for this. The thing is that nobody is really wanting to plunge the world into World War III.It is interesting how this movie portrays the captain and life on the sub. In the cramped spaces tensions really start to get tight and guns are even pulled.

Even though Russians are supposed to be friendly now, they are not going to be too happy if an American nuclear missile lands in their back yard and will probably retaliate.I guess this movie returns to the theme that was addressed in War Games and that is the threat that nuclear weapons bring. An accidental firing of a rifle might kill one person, and even if a war breaks out, casualties will be small. If a nuclear missile is accidentally launched them a lot more people are going to die and even if a compromise is made then the damage is already done and a large place will be radioactive. A nuclear strike of any magnitude is enough to wipe out large portions of the world. I guess this movie reminds us that the threat of nuclear war is still very present, especially with North Korea launching missiles over Japan.On the movie as a whole it is very tense. The cramped confines of the submarine adds to the tension and the news broadcasts set the scene very well. As soon as the sub goes down and all contact is lost then we don't know. The cinematography is very good and Gene Hackman, once again, steals the show, but then again so does Denzel Washington, who has started to earn his honours.

Actually, I don't think political thriller is the exact title that one would use for this film, but I think that it is the closet description that I would give it.

Capturing the base he then made a threat that he was going to launch missiles at the United States so their subs are sent out. The situation reaches a point where they are about to launch the missiles so the US orders a nuclear strike. But a couple of minutes later another message is sent out but the sub receives only half of it which leads to a conflict between the captain and the executive officer as to what course to take.

The first thing that raises is that even with the collapse of communism in Russia and the end of the cold war does not mean the end of the threat of nuclear war. If a mad dictator like Hitler were to gain control of Russia, even though it is little more than a third world country, it still has a military force that can seriously threaten the United States and the world. It also has a lot of nuclear weapons meaning that a very anti-US dictator could still start World War Three.

For all we know the quote could have been it is not a slick &#x85; movie). I have not seen Carrie (as of the time of writing), but The Craft is nothing like Clueless, nor is it slick, hip, or smart arse. It isn't a bad movie, but it isn't one that catapults to the top of excellence either.The Craft is about a girl who moves to Los Angeles and goes to a Catholic School. She begins as an outcast because she is new, and is pushed even further out when she refuses to go to bed with Chris, the school stud. As such she ends up joining with the school's misfits who are rumoured to be witches. They are actually witches, but they need a forth person to make their power work, and Sarah, the new kid, happens to be the perfect forth person.They claim to worship the god Mamoun, who is basically all of nature. They claim that Mamoun is older than any other god and is the only true god. God was only created by mankind who chose to ignore Mamoun. This I dispute because I believe Mamoun was created by man who did not want to worship the true God. Mamoun is nature while God is beyond nature as he created nature and as such expects us to look after it.Mamoun bestows these girls with magical powers, but whatever these girls do is revisited upon them three times. Sarah wants to get back at Chris so makes him fall in love with her, but this love spell backfires and she cannot get away from him. He is so madly in love with her that his sexual urges are fired up to the point where he is do anything to have sex with her, including raping her.Danny becomes corrupted by the power that she works with. She is little more than white trash, living in a small house with quarrelling parents. She wants out anyway she can so she basically asks for the power of Mamoun, but after somebody close to them dies Sarah wants out and Danny will not let her.This movie is about how power corrupts people if one is not careful. The one that was corrupted the most was the one that had the least. As such it seems that it is attacking the rags to riches philosophy. Those who are poor and powerless are that way because they do not know how to handle power. This is not always the case though because some poor people rise to power and are remembered for their goodness, while others who are born rich are intensely corrupt and abuse their power constantly.My friends rave about this movie, but I don't think that it is that great. It is just fancy effects and magic in the modern time with a pretty simple plot. The plot itself does not grab me and the characters have little depth. They are simply unpopular people who really want to become popular, and there is little else to them. Thus, unfortunately, is the way people are anyway.

After all, Neill's voice could be heard talking to Neill (1) on the phone, early on in the film. And why not? Adjani gets to have a nonsensical double, so why not poor ol' Neill. I think they shouldn't have even stopped there; the German granny should have been doubled, ditto her strange Kung-Fu-loving son, and the all the rest of the cast, turning this into a body snatchers kind of scenario. Not that this would distract from the essence of the movie, the real message, the main story, for there is no message and no essence at all, and the story becomes increasingly disjointed and comical as the movie ends its amazingly bizarre conclusion. To be fair, occasionally I had the impression the director wanted laughs. But how can I be sure? It's all guess-work.In P every single character needs to be locked up in a maximum security loony bin. I guess if they had told me at the outset that all the events here take place on planet Zong, I'd have been far better prepared for all the lunacy they had in store for me.Utterly bizarre nonsense, but entertaining because totally unpredictable, with bombastic over-the-top performances by the leading pair. I can picture Neill and Adjani asking the director for water and some rest every five minutes or so, what with all the shouting, contorting and general mayhem, having to be manic for almost the entire movie-shoot in order to satisfy the insatiable director who was truly out for blood. The pinnacle of all this madness was perhaps the scene in the subway, when Adjani hollers, jumps around, and bumps into walls for several minutes.George Lucas is legendary for giving out instructions such as faster! more intense! to his actors during the filming of Star Wars. I kind of picture this director going stranger! more odd! overact more! shout and salivate! look wild and crazy! shake your head more! being the standard vocabulary in usage here. If only I'd been a fly on the wall.There are attempts to inject meaning into the chaos by having characters occasionally utter philosophical musings amidst all the silly proceedings. There was babbling about sisters faith and chance by Adjani - a monologue so vacuous that it really could only come out of the mouth of a person who tries to cut their own throat with an electric kitchen knife. There are several religious references, too, in which God's existence is the subject, plus a totally weird and baffling scene in which Adjani stares up at a statue of Jesus, holding a grocery back directly under her crotch (her, not Jesus), and making faint noises that I used to think could only come out of a drunken hamster spinning on a wheel.P starts of as a heavy-handed relationship family drama then takes a totally unexpected horror turn. Well, it WOULD have been unexpected had the opening credits not mentioned that there were creature effects i.e. that there was a monster! Now, WHY the hell would they tell us that in advance??? I for one was none-too-pleased that the monster surprise-twist was taken away with that idiotic decision. What director IN HIS RIGHT MIND gives us a SPOILER in the first minute?! Whatever one might say about this hugely absurd film, one thing can't be taken away from it it remains interesting throughout, not boring for a minute, in spite of running over two hours. Additionally, TP has been quite an influential movie, as I've realized. Clive Barker's Hellraiser was not nearly as original as I'd thought it was; he must have stolen the idea of the slow transformation from-blood'n'bones-goo-to-human-form from this zany flick. Naked Lunch (the monster sex) and Lost Highway (the total lack of story within the story, and Neill talking to himself on the phone) also come to mind, though it's difficult to say who borrowed from whom in the case of the former.

To be fair, occasionally I had the impression the director wanted laughs. But how can I be sure? It's all guess-work.In P every single character needs to be locked up in a maximum security loony bin. I guess if they had told me at the outset that all the events here take place on planet Zong, I'd have been far better prepared for all the lunacy they had in store for me.Utterly bizarre nonsense, but entertaining because totally unpredictable, with bombastic over-the-top performances by the leading pair. I can picture Neill and Adjani asking the director for water and some rest every five minutes or so, what with all the shouting, contorting and general mayhem, having to be manic for almost the entire movie-shoot in order to satisfy the insatiable director who was truly out for blood. The pinnacle of all this madness was perhaps the scene in the subway, when Adjani hollers, jumps around, and bumps into walls for several minutes.George Lucas is legendary for giving out instructions such as faster! more intense! to his actors during the filming of Star Wars. I kind of picture this director going stranger! more odd! overact more! shout and salivate! look wild and crazy! shake your head more! being the standard vocabulary in usage here. If only I'd been a fly on the wall.There are attempts to inject meaning into the chaos by having characters occasionally utter philosophical musings amidst all the silly proceedings. There was babbling about sisters faith and chance by Adjani - a monologue so vacuous that it really could only come out of the mouth of a person who tries to cut their own throat with an electric kitchen knife. There are several religious references, too, in which God's existence is the subject, plus a totally weird and baffling scene in which Adjani stares up at a statue of Jesus, holding a grocery back directly under her crotch (her, not Jesus), and making faint noises that I used to think could only come out of a drunken hamster spinning on a wheel.P starts of as a heavy-handed relationship family drama then takes a totally unexpected horror turn. Well, it WOULD have been unexpected had the opening credits not mentioned that there were creature effects i.e. that there was a monster! Now, WHY the hell would they tell us that in advance??? I for one was none-too-pleased that the monster surprise-twist was taken away with that idiotic decision. What director IN HIS RIGHT MIND gives us a SPOILER in the first minute?! Whatever one might say about this hugely absurd film, one thing can't be taken away from it it remains interesting throughout, not boring for a minute, in spite of running over two hours. Additionally, TP has been quite an influential movie, as I've realized. Clive Barker's Hellraiser was not nearly as original as I'd thought it was; he must have stolen the idea of the slow transformation from-blood'n'bones-goo-to-human-form from this zany flick. Naked Lunch (the monster sex) and Lost Highway (the total lack of story within the story, and Neill talking to himself on the phone) also come to mind, though it's difficult to say who borrowed from whom in the case of the former. TP is truly a one-of-a-kind horror film. It's just a pity that laziness (under the banner of surrealism) overtook the script-writing process. There could have been an actual story here that made sense, if only more effort had been placed.Let's face it. P is an original movie, and it is interesting, fascinating even at times, but to write this kind of meaningless nonsense requires little thought and absolutely no planning whatsoever. Kudos to the director and cast, shame on the writer. There is no message or point to convey, no at least semi-reasonable conclusion to wrap things up, just a bunch of people being weird for the sake of it (for the sake of oh-so artistic surrealism (that word alone gets some people to drool and swoon)). Naturally, there are going to be art-house movie-goers and deranged critics who will find the deepest cosmological meanings in all this, but I think it's about time that European cinema finally moves away from lazy overly absurdist writing, with more productions based on compact, well-structured scripts that actually take TIME to write. Nobody is saying go Hollywood, but a middle ground between self-indulgent boring meaningless drivel a-la Godard and totally commercial garbage a-la J.J. Abrams is probably the way to go. ","genre":"Drama, Horror"},{"date":"9 December 2011","score":"","review":" Adapted from an Irwin Shaw novel, The Young Lions follows the lives of three men from the beginning of WWII to its final days. Marlon Brando plays a modest German villager who finds that he makes quite an effective soldier even as his innate humanism causes him to continually question the cause for which he is fighting; Montgomery Clift is an American Jew willing to fight for a country that is still rife with anti-Semitism, and Dean Martin is a showman whose reluctance to join up is due more to a trace of cowardice than any moral conflicts.For the most part, it's almost like watching two films although Clift and Martin share plenty of screen time, the three stars only share one fleeting scene. Sometimes, this can work if the separate strands contain some mirroring, but in this case there are few comparisons between the German and American stories to be made, leaving the film with a disjointed feel that refuses to go away.I'm not sure whether Brando's performance is good or not. His accent definitely sounds German, but occasionally seems to tip over into parody. I suppose you'd need to be a German to know for sure. Anyway, his performance is good enough. Martin, although making his dramatic debut, is still just Dean Martin in a uniform. They even manage to squeeze in a couple of numbers for him. His character isn't very likable for much of the film &#x96; especially towards his girlfriend (who shares a few scenes with Brando's character early in the film). It's possible his guilt causes him to push her away, but knowing that doesn't really help us like him. Clift's performance is hesitant, low key. It's supposed to hint at hidden depths. He takes on four of his unit's biggest men after they claim to have stolen his twenty dollars, receiving a sound beating for each of the first three fights before overcoming his final tormentor. It's a pretty poor piece of storytelling, if you ask me, but I suppose it serves its purpose.

Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is very bland at best. Even in the love scenes with Juliet, he had about as much personality as a piece of wood. Claire Danes was fine as Juliet.

Harold Perrineau's performance as Mercutio was (much like Leguizamo's) plagued with another case of overacting. The only actor who seemed to do very well in his role was Pete Postlethwaite as Friar Laurence. He had the calm, mellow attitude that was accurate for a modern version of the character. As for the supporting cast, none of them really stood out and even if they did it wasn't for anything good at all.As for the production elements, it was very lack luster.
