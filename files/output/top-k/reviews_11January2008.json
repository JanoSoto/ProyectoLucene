It's a great movie for teens everywhere.It starts out when Ferris' mother Katie checks up on him. She sees him in bed and he doesn't look too good. When I see Ferris, I laugh. It's just the way he looks; he looks dead, eyes open. However, he is only pretending, and his sister Jean knows it from the second she sees him. It's odd how Jennifer Grey and Matt Broderick were dating when they filmed this. Of course, the parents buy it, and they leave him to rest and he will miss school for the day. A classic line from Ferris They bought it. He then teaches us how to fake the parents out. It's pretty good. At school, the Dean of Students, Mr. Edward Rooney, is suspicious of Ferris' increasing amount of absences from school. He feels as though Ferris is skipping. Well, of course, he's right. Meanwhile, in Ferris' class, the teacher--who I do feel bad for--repeats, Bueller? Bueller? Bueller? At that same time, Ferris' best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) is actually sick. A line that I still like from there is, When Cameron was in Egypt's land...let my Cameron go. Eventually, Ferris gets Cameron out of bed. Back at school, Sloan (Mia Sara) is asked to go home after the passing of her grandmother. Rooney thinks that Ferris is behind it. However, he calls on the other line. It turns out that Rooney is talking to Cameron, doing his best impersonation of Sgt. Peterson, Sloan's dad. They pull it off, and they steal Cam's dad's 1961 Ferrari GT California. It's something along the lines of that. When they get to school, they pick her up, and drive off into the late morning. Most of the movie takes place in the heart of Chicago, with the 3 of them seeing the sights of the city. Various things include cheating a snooty waiter into thinking Ferris is Abe Froman (The Sausage King of Chicago), and seating them in a restaurant that Ferris' father Tom goes to. They see a museum with some very nice paintings including A Sunday at Grand la Jatte. For those of you who don't know, that's the one that has all those individual dots of pigment. It's really cool; I don't know how that guy did it.In between this, Rooney invades the Bueller home, while Jeanie goes home to prove that Ferris is faking. When she gets there, she thinks Ferris is home when it's really Rooney. Rooney thinks that Jeanie is Ferris, with the 2 of them saying--Jean, then Rooney--Ferris.. Bueller.. When they jump for the other, Jean screams and kicks Rooney in the face. Her look is priceless. Her call to the police is funny. This isn't a phony phone call! There is a intruder, male Caucasian, possibly armed...my name is Bueller...look, it's real nice that you hope that my brother's okay but I am in danger! I am very cute, I am very alone and I am very protective of my body! I do not want it violated or killed, ALRIGHT???!! I need HELP!! SPEAKING IN English????!!!!!! D\/CKHEAD!!!!!!!!! Excuse me, whoever was in the house is still in the house, I'd like to let you know that I've just called the police, so if you have any brains whatsoever you'll get your @ss out of my house..... I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and a scorching case of herpes.Of course, last but definitely not least, Ferris goes on the float in the parade, first singing 'Danke shen', then 'Twist and Shout' by The Beatles, with a group doing, 'coincidentally', moves from the Thriller music video. It is a very memorable moment, and it would be so cool to do that!! With the last bit of time left for Ferris, they return the Ferrari back to Cam's place, but with the mileage too high, Cameron kicks the car's front because Cam's father loves the car more than he loves Cameron. When he leans on it, it drives backwards since they still had it in reverse to bring back the mileage, it smashes into the glass wall behind it, falls, and lands on the ground. Cam had killed the car, as Ferris stated. Cameron accepts this, and says he'll deal with his dad.With 5 minutes left, Ferris kisses Sloan, who says, He's going to marry me, and Ferris runs off home to beat his dad, mom, and sister. As the race gets more intense, Ferris runs to the back but gets caught by Rooney. However, Jeanie saves him, and lets him get back in bed. Jeanie throws Mr. Rooney's wallet that fell onto the floor into the mud. Ferris manages to get into bed as though nothing had happened just in time. When Katie and Tom check on him, they still think that he's still sick. The movie ends with Ferris saying as he said before in the beginning, Yep. I said it before and I'll say it again... Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around, you could miss it.Good words to go by. The movie is lots of fun. Clever one that Ferris is.

I remembered it as an exciting near-chaos-future adventure with highway cops in muscle cars and one insane biker gang. It's great how it keeps on standing the test of time. High speed and raw power are of every age, past and future. The way the highway action is shot in this movie simply stays exhilarating, putting it in the top ranking of best high-speed-chase movies ever. Seeing the camera follow the highway marker at high speed, along with the sound of a bike- or V8-engine delivers a Mad and chaotic but really cool result. The pace of the movie remains considerably high, without many slow moments.Some aspects of the movie have (understandably) dated. Obviously the 70's clothing and hair styles. Sometimes the acting is a little over the top, and some characters could come directly from a comic book. And of course the story is not that deep or difficult. It's partly action-thriller, partly science fiction adventure. All weaknesses are covered and compensated by lots of a-moral fun though.At the heart of this one of a kind look movie, there is a hero character named Max. This speed-demon-cop is at the top of his game on the highway, ruthlessly dealing with maniacs ravaging his jurisdiction. But he is also a happy family man with his wife and son. This duality makes the character human, timeless and very memorable. In some scenes you can clearly see Mel Gibson was only just getting into acting. For a rookie he was doing a good job nonetheless.Others strengths lie within the scary nature of the biker gang. An extravagant rag-tag band of maniacs, led by the iconic villain The ToeCutter. To this day, their actions remain tough and very disturbing. It will have you staring at the screen dead serious, making Max' battle against them even more gratifying.There is much to say about this movie, but first and foremost it is a must see.

The plot to Alien was that a group of miners in outer space are woken up from hibernation after a long shift to respond to a stress signal but what they don't know is that they're really supposed to bring back an Alien. Leviathan is a group of miners 2 miles below the sea unknowingly stumble upon a sunk Russian boat and all the sailors dead from what turned out to be genetic mutation. I can understand the similarities where both movies the characters are miners and there was a cover up for the situation ready, but other than that its two entirely different stories. The crew of Alien was supposed to search out the aliens while the crew of Leviathan accidentally stumbled upon everything. Meg Foster's character tried to cover everything up in the end but at first I doubt she knew or had any intention of sending Peter Weller and company to certain death. So now that I've cleared that up, on with the review...I thought the cast was incredible. Peter Weller always was underrated and I say he shined better in this than in Robocop. Amanda Pays was GORGEOUS in this movie, just hearing her British accent makes her even more beautiful. Richard Crenna, Lisa Elibacher and Michael Carmine did their best to fill out the roster while Daniel Stern, Hector Elizondo and Ernie Hudson were their usual selves. Hell, Daniel Stern had the best lines in the movie, why'd they have to kill him off so fast? Meg Foster freaks me out, even in They Live she was freaky but this takes the cake, she scared me more than the Leviathan monsters.The only negatives I can think of were the opening scene where Doc (Crenna) took the day off and wasn't there when Dejesus (Carmine) almost imploded. Beck (Weller) then has to chastise Doc the next morning, for him not being there, which is where reality doesn't jive. They're 2 miles below sea level meaning he had to have been somewhere inside the mining shack, how can you convince the audience that someone can't be found in a closed environment like that? Not to mention how he can take a sick day if he himself was perfectly fine in the before mentioned closed environment? The positives are everywhere, the one liners, the thrill ride when the shyt hits the fan, the ending scene. I don't want to give away too much but needless to say if you liked Alien I'm pretty sure you'll like this movie. The highlight of the movie was when Doc starts getting excited about the idea of genetic mutation and how people could possibly live underwater so Beck scoffs and says Well what if we run out of airplanes, do we just grow a whole bunch of bird people?7 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 January 2008","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" What I don't understand is everyone says this movie is nothing but an Alien ripoff, and while in some cases that's true....the simple fact is its a good movie if you don't look at it that way.

The highlight of the movie was when Doc starts getting excited about the idea of genetic mutation and how people could possibly live underwater so Beck scoffs and says Well what if we run out of airplanes, do we just grow a whole bunch of bird people?7 out of 10 ","genre":"Adventure, Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"11 January 2008","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Amazing I didn't hear about this one until recently, but that seems to be the song and dance with these cult films.

At least among those who might have some identification with these blokes it's about twenty-something out of work actors in 1969 who go aimlessly through a holiday at one of the bloke's uncle's house out in the country where nothing goes right (least of which with the uncle itself). But it's also got sharp-as-a-tack dialog, the kind of zingers that seem to have a droll way about them even as the actors deliver them with a style that fits the malaise or eccentricities or just plain ego they carry with them.And, of course, it's very funny. It's the kind of humor that snuck up on me, where the oddball seems what it is, but also with an air of reality that doesn't seem false. It would be one thing if Bruce Robinson were after simple quirks. But he's lived this world he's created (it's largely autobiographical), and the gray look and the grime and grit and rain et all fits the sensibility of the comedy.

And, of course, there's straight-man and comic-relief, so to speak, with I and Withnail respectively.I\/Marwood (Paul McGann, great at doing an half-neurotic, half-awkward-around-the-flaming-uncle bit) is a bit of a wreck emotionally, swinging between slightly normal and totally on edge scene to scene, and Withnail (the brilliant Richard Grant, probably one of the best things, if one could point out in the movie in and of itself) who's a bigger than life dude, who thinks of himself as such more than anything, and washes his (somewhat) hidden misery with booze. Like all lovable jerks, he sees himself as being much more than he is because he acts it, whether he gets into a jam (i.e. at the pub, with the cops, with a farmer) or if he's just fobbing off whilst drenched in body lotion. It's a solid match. Then there's also two key supporting roles with Uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths, the kind of British character actor you spot here and there in movies), who's a total nut with a penchant for weird carrots- as well as, gulp, Marwood- and Danny, who in the first scene almost appears as a wild fluke, as a kind of deranged bad-ass in the guise of your common spaced-out drug dealer, and then later on appears again and brings it full circle in one of the funniest pot scenes I've ever seen.Sometimes a joke or a look goes over the head, or the 'British-ness' of the comedy, where it's sometimes in a mood that relies on a sudden reaction or another line to bounce back. But these aren't often enough to bring down this recommendation Withnail & I is a slightly crazy movie about sad sacks who've got their lives ahead of them, or not as case might be, and it's another in a lot of many quasi-nostalgia tales of the late 60s, only with a bit more deep-down lament than some others.

Such a smooth and exciting film. It flows style and finesse. And then in 1990 came the obligatory sequel. A substantial step down, notably because of Renny Harlin's presence in the director's chair, it took the flawless, tightly plotted original and turned it into an action-packed no-brainer.Die Hard With a Vengeance has quite a lot to make up for. And judging from the talent that went into it, I had very high hopes for it. Not only does it bring back Bruce Willis as Detective John McClane, it partners him up with Samuel L Jackson. It has Jeremy Irons in the role of the villain. And sees the welcome return of Die Hard director John McTiernan.I was expecting great things. But unfortunately, I ended up being a bit disappointed. Its certainly nice to see McTiernan back, and wisely he's adjusted the plot so its not a straight out rehash of Pt 1. The mistake Pt 2 fell into. But somehow, it has more flaws than it should for a film with so many good things to recommend it.It begins with a cracker of an opening. New York is going about its business when suddenly an explosion rocks the streets of Manhattan. Thoughts of 9\/11 immediately spring to mind. The film even includes shots of the World Trade Center in the background, making DHWAV a very eerie film at times.The bomber who claims responsibility has only just begun. And he has a request to make of the NYPD. Get John McClane on the case. They're going to play a game of Simon Says. Simon gives McClane hints about where other bombs are planted in the city. And if McClane doesn't figure out how to defuse them, or even find where they are...well you can guess the rest.A hungover McClane, separated from his beloved Holly (sadly Bonnie Bedelia couldn't make it), is on suspension. But he's back on active duty quicker than you can say Yippie-Kayee. Saddled with Zeus (Jackson), a Harlem shopkeeper, the two must unravel Simon's riddles before the next bomb goes off. But things are not what they seem.The good news about Die Hard With a Vengeance is that it is a better film than Pt 2. McTiernan keeps the action steady, Pulp Fiction stars Jackson and Willis are an inspired double-act, and Jeremy Irons clearly loves chewing on the scenery before he blows it up.But somehow I was left with a nagging feeling of disappointment. And I only realised why after seeing it for the second time. The film begins promisingly enough with Simon's little games. They're quite lively, with lots of witty banter between Jackson and Willis, and some of the finest action not seen since...well Die Hard actually!But when it gets to the halfway point, the film then heads off in another direction. It turns out Simon's little game of Find the Bomb is just to keep the NYPD distracted, while he gets what he really wants. A gold heist. While everybody is running around like headless chickens trying to find a bomb he's put in a school, Simon's looting every gold depository in town.When I first saw DHWAV, this new angle seemed novel and inventive. But gradually, it was a plot development that rang a bit hollow. Its almost like the film is trying to be a bit too clever for its own good. Some people may accept it. And others may not. I suppose the film just about gets away with it, but the effort to do so does show through.Nethertheless, this film is a considerable improvement over its predecessor. It never gets quite as mindless as Die Hard 2, but that's because John McTiernan is a much better director than Renny Harlin. And he brings his usual style and finesse to this film as well. The action scenes are just as exciting as you'd expect. But more importantly, McTiernan made the wise choice to emphasise on the buddy relationship between McClane and Zeus.The two of them have cracking chemistry. In fact if truth be told, the film sags whenever McClane and Zeus aren't around. The Die Hard series up to this point has always been a one man show. With the inclusion of Zeus, its become a buddy movie. It does tread over some of the usual racial jokes, but I always believed they're grudging respect for each other.As for Jeremy Irons, he does not too badly at all as Simon Gruber, the brother of Hans Gruber, the villain of Die Hard, played by the magnificent Alan Rickman. Irons never quite leaves an indelible impression upon the film the way Rickman did, but at least he keeps himself in check. He never launches into the over the top theatrics that scuppered Dungeons & Dragons. His German accent is convincing enough. But his attempt at an American accent...well, the less said the better.As the film draws to a close, I did start to get a bit lost. I think McTiernan overdoes some of the action to the point of overkill. In fact McTiernan is guilty of some of the things he was parodying in his previous film, the very underrated Last Action Hero.Also it makes it that much harder to follow the film at that point. If only the ending had some of the first half's cohesion, I might have praised it almost as favourably as Die Hard. Some of the film's plot holes are so big, they come dangerously close to capsizing it. But still, Die Hard With a Vengeance is a worthwhile addition to the series. Its just starting to feel a bit stretched at this point. At least its not as noticeable here as it was with Die Hard 4.

It starts with the common thread, the bellboy, Tim Roth. It seemed like he was trying to be the British incarnation of Don Knotts trying to be Jerry Lewis. It was one of the most annoying and incomprehensibly bad performances, I've ever seen from a mainstream actor.He gets no help from what passes for plot. The first two stories seemed like they came from a 10 second pre-improv conference.

Kenton, Screenplay...Scott Darling, Eric Taylor.The final Frankenstein movie, The Ghost of Frankenstein was released in 1942, while World War II raged in Europe. Americans flocked to see the resolution to their favorite horror film franchise, escaping reality and living in the eerie and mysterious Gothic Germany of Mary Shelley's fiction and brought to life by Universal Studios. The first film had starred Boris Karloff, the best interpretor of the Monster role, which he reprised in Bride of Frankenstein. But the equally terrific horror film actor Lon Cheney also donned the Frankenstein outfit and did a good job. In the final movie, following the plot to Son of Frankenstein, the son and heir of Dr. Frankenstein (Cedric Hardwicke) is once again in trouble due to his father's legacy and his monstrous creation. Ygor (Lugosi) has been seen in town when the villagers had believed he had died along with the monster. In his exile, the Doctor is powerless to stop the wicked deeds of Ygor and it is obvious to viewers it is Ygor, not Frankenstein, that is the real monster. Ygor is a conniving, cynical and wicked,deathless little troll who likes to create mayhem. Frankenstein has only two weaknesses - his master Ygor and children. His actions are only reactions to the villagers shunning him and hating him for being different, despite the fact that he becomes more and more human as the film series progressed. Before long, Baron Wolf Frankenstein devises a plan to rid the world of Frankenstein. He will perform a brain transplant, which his father had once done with Frankenstein. His evil ways owe to his criminal brain which should have been a normal brain. But Ygor interferes and makes it possible for his brain to be in Frankenstein's body. This science-fiction element really works and despite the criticism it got, I find it very exciting. This film is not slow-moving or full of too much mystery as the other preceding films which ran too long and hardly any action occurred up until the final minutes of the film, usually ending in a climax in which it is believed Frankenstein dies only to discover in the next film that he was alive. Well, this time it's all over for good. The film has wonderful music, acting and cinematography and is a marvelous way to end the Frankenstein movies. Lon Cheney proves to be quite the versatile actor. Bela Lugosi (best known as Dracula) is probably better as the less in-your-face and more subtle Ygor than Dracula. Lugosi and Lon Cheney, despite being real life actor rivals, were wonderful to see on screen. Universal would not end their horror film series completely. They went on to make many other movies and Frankenstein appeared in other films in which he was not the star (Abbot and Costello Meet the Wolf Man, for instance) Frankenstein was borrowed by many other directors and producers and would become as much an American icon as Superman.

In the final movie, following the plot to Son of Frankenstein, the son and heir of Dr. Frankenstein (Cedric Hardwicke) is once again in trouble due to his father's legacy and his monstrous creation. Ygor (Lugosi) has been seen in town when the villagers had believed he had died along with the monster. In his exile, the Doctor is powerless to stop the wicked deeds of Ygor and it is obvious to viewers it is Ygor, not Frankenstein, that is the real monster. Ygor is a conniving, cynical and wicked,deathless little troll who likes to create mayhem. Frankenstein has only two weaknesses - his master Ygor and children. His actions are only reactions to the villagers shunning him and hating him for being different, despite the fact that he becomes more and more human as the film series progressed. Before long, Baron Wolf Frankenstein devises a plan to rid the world of Frankenstein. He will perform a brain transplant, which his father had once done with Frankenstein. His evil ways owe to his criminal brain which should have been a normal brain. But Ygor interferes and makes it possible for his brain to be in Frankenstein's body. This science-fiction element really works and despite the criticism it got, I find it very exciting. This film is not slow-moving or full of too much mystery as the other preceding films which ran too long and hardly any action occurred up until the final minutes of the film, usually ending in a climax in which it is believed Frankenstein dies only to discover in the next film that he was alive. Well, this time it's all over for good. The film has wonderful music, acting and cinematography and is a marvelous way to end the Frankenstein movies. Lon Cheney proves to be quite the versatile actor. Bela Lugosi (best known as Dracula) is probably better as the less in-your-face and more subtle Ygor than Dracula. Lugosi and Lon Cheney, despite being real life actor rivals, were wonderful to see on screen. Universal would not end their horror film series completely. They went on to make many other movies and Frankenstein appeared in other films in which he was not the star (Abbot and Costello Meet the Wolf Man, for instance) Frankenstein was borrowed by many other directors and producers and would become as much an American icon as Superman.

Balderston, Josef Berne, Lawrence G. Blochman, Tom Reed, R.C. Sheriff.Audiences adored Frankenstein, Universal's successful horror film based on Mary Shelley's classic tale of horror. Boris Karloff won instant Hollywood fame as the Frankenstein monster and this would become his signature role despite taking on many other horror roles. Because the first Frankenstein film was such a hit, it soon became clear to Universal Studios that they should make a franchise and series of horror films with recurring characters and monsters. These would go on to include Dracula (portrayed by both Bela Lugosi and Lon Cheney) Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, The Mummy and The Invisible Man. This is an unauthorized sequel since Mary Shelley had nothing to do with writing it and it's purely the work of Hollywood writers. Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) turns out not to have died in the mill the angry mob set fire to. They believe they destroyed the Monster but it becomes gradually apparent that the monster is alive and well. He runs a muck and begins his killings in the German forests, scaring off his first victim (Una O'Connor in a hilarious role) who warns others that she has seen the monster with her own eyes come back from the dead. In one early scene, he spies a beautiful shepherdess (Anne Darling) and he attacks her in what is almost visually a near-rape-scene. The monster is soon out of control but only the violin music of a blind man and hermit (O.P. Heggie) has the power to soothe the monster and puts him on a hypnotic and tranquil state. Dr. Frankenstein abandons his wife and citizen's duty once again, enamored with his power to create life. He discovers that another scientist has created miniature life through a combination of strong magic and science. The mad scientist has his work cut out for him again. This time, discovering that all Frankenstein really wants is a mate, he sets out to create a Bride for him. She is made up of dead body parts like Frankenstein with a human female brain. She is beautiful but strange and upon seeing Frankenstein she is repulsed by him. Frankenstein, feeling his first heartbreak, decides to end his life and hers. This would have been a strongly romantic and tragic story if the horror\/mystery element wasn't so heavy and in the audience's faces. In 1935, the Hays Code did not permit too much violence, not even in horror films and looking at these types of movies, they were nothing more than heavy Gothic melodrama with more mystery than horror. Audiences scared more easily. This sequel to Frankenstein has been considered the best in the Frankenstein series but I thought it was too slow-moving and lacked enough suspense and thrills and chills to make it a good horror film. The best in the series is the original Frankenstein and the last Frankenstein film -Ghost of Frankenstein. Bride has its moments and what most people remember is Elsa Lanchester's memorable get-up as the Bride, with that high-piled hairdo and her bloodcurdling scream. But really Elsa Lanchester is not doing any real acting as she appears only two times, first as Mary Shelley the Victorian novelist entertaining guests with her stories and then as the Bride who cannot speak but can sure scream her head off. Frankenstein is able to talk (Boris Karloff's voice) and he appears to be very human and intelligent. Apparently, this did not catch on and in the other movies he's back to being just a growling and stupid killing machine. Colin Clive hams it up again as the ambitious mad scientist. Another wonderful aspect of the movie is the music by veteran Hollywood film composer Franz Waxman (he would do the music to Sunset Boulevard among his many film scores). Waxman creates an atmosphere of eerie mystery and Gothic beauty and even romance. It's too bad the movie moves too slowly and has very little to offer save for visual grandeur. But this is a favorite of many horror film fans and a definite classic.
