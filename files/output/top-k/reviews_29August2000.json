I agree with the other viewers who commented that 'Loser' was predictable, it is. However, it's entertaining - it's a very light movie, ideal for watching to relax. Nothing special, but definitely not lousy.

Which I also disagree with.Because Halloween 3 had nothing to do with Michael Myers. It was a competely different story, with no connection with the rest of the series. Which in my opinion sucked. In Friday The 13th part 5 we are still following the story of Tommy jarvis. The guy who went against Jason in the last movie, So we have some of the same characters here. This movie still has the familiar music score of the series, that hasn't changed. We have the same eerie dark feel to this movie which the first 4 movies had. And I might add that this is the last movie in the series with the original darker approach. Before the series went for a more unserious comedy atmosphere. The characters in this movie are pretty cool. The production of the movie is very good as well, a step higher from the final chapter. While watching this, I still feel like I'm watching a friday the 13th movie. unlike how I feel when I watch Jason Goes To Hell. which to me isn't really a Jason movie. This one is.

It is a wonderful portrayal of four pre-teen boys who spend the last weekend of summer on an adventure before facing the difficult changes of junior high.By now most everyone has seen this movie so I won't go into detail about the storyline, but I will comment on a couple of my favorite scenes, which hopefully should not serve as spoilers for anyone who might not have seen this yet.  One of those that I really like is where Chris (River Phoenix) shares with Gordie (Wil Wheaton) how hard it is to be judged and ridiculed because of the family he comes from.  Then later on Gordie in turn shares with Chris how hard it has been still living under the shadow of his popular older brother, who had been killed several months beforehand, and whom Gordie felt his parents loved more.  Both scenes displayed compassion and total acceptance of best friends, as well as the insecurities each of them face even at that age.This was a wonderful movie with a mixture of humor and sensitivity, without being downbeat at all.  Wonderful performances by all of the cast, especially Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix.  My only complaints about this movie are the profanity, which I understand was not quite as prominent in that era; and the fact that I wish it could have been longer.  However, as I stated before it is my definite all-time favorite movie.More than anything else, I believe that this movie is a reminder that no matter how far friends may drift apart as they get older, the memories they had shared will always remain in a person's heart.

Unless you see this film, I don't think you'll have the necessary frame of reference with which to to base any expectations on.  It's an incredibly engrossing, moving and often comedic experience, but time and time again what knocks you over is the absolute finesse with which this script was crafted.  The fact that the acting and direction are flawless and surprisingly natural-seeming (most old movies usually seem stiff or people seem to act too much) only enhances it that much more.  With this film, you can really imagine the *people* the actors are portraying.All About Eve shows some similarity to one of my other favourite 50s films A Face in the Crowd.  Both are studies of fame and celebrity.  Eve shows how a person will corrupt themselves in order to attain it, whereas A Face's premise is that fame corrupts those who find themselves in the spotlight. Both have themes that are perhaps even more resonant in our celebrity-obsessed culture now than when they were made. Interestingly, Eve predates A Face by several years.And possibly most interesting of all is the honest and often raw way in which women are portrayed, the strength of their character and the power they wield.  The male contingent is practically relegated to the back seat. One might be hard pressed to find a movie quite so liberated today.  So what more can I say?

The only real performance might be Vincent D'Onofrio, but even he couldn't save the film.Jennifer proves once and for all that her a** is hers and not surgically altered. Many people will see it for that few seconds at her refrigerator.The film has been described as a cross between Matrix and Silence of the Lambs.

Fact is, if you are looking for Silence or Matrix, go and rent them, because this falls short of the mark.After my negative comments, let's look at why I was generous enough to give rehashed plot and characters a 7 out of 10.  The visual imagery is simply stunning, beyond compare.  What the plot and actors lack, the sets more than make up for.  This is a film made for the big screen!  See it in the theater.  DVD isn't even quality enough for this.  Experience it in the theater at least once.Check your brain at the door and just enjoy the colors, bright, dark, emotional.  The cinematography is the real film, not the shoddy story along with it.Spoilers!!!!  Warning, do not read if you do not want to know more...Shoddy detective work by the FBI is simply disappointing.  The whole film pins the detective work on a woman entering a serial killer's mind to find a woman we barely care about.  She is never given much of a soul to make us care if they find her alive or not.  What agent would see a strange piece of machinery, which is obviously part of the mutilation chamber in the killer's home and no one is working on checking that angle until said detective goes into the killer's mind to save the well experienced child psychologist from remaining trapped.  Then, like a revelation, he sees the symbol from the machinery in the killer's mind and connects it to the real world, calls his people to find the manufacturer.  In the 30 plus hours they had to crack into the killer's brain, the FBI still hadn't finished setting up a grid in the killer's tiny home and no one had bothered to examine the cellar, where they found the incriminating video.  Instead, the FBI had focused on the messy, tiny attic for the grid.The little boy - his father is wealthy and the boy is found on a seal island in a coma.  Why tell us any of that?  Why introduce his parents for 2 minutes and introduce a possible bad relationship between the kid's father and Lopez, then never examine either thing?I feel that Singh has a brilliant career ahead of him if only he can find a more polished screenwriter than Protosevitch, who also might have a career if he puts his own thoughts on his own stories rather than churning out bad imitations of other original screenplays.We already know Lopez has a glorious career ahead of her.  Between modeling, acting, and singing, we will be seeing her for years.  She needs to be more careful about script control.  This character could have been more interesting, but again that falls on a poor writer.  At least she isn't acting with snakes anymore.Vin D'Onofrio needs more vehicles to show his talents.  Certainly, when the bio of Stephen King is made, he should get the role!Vince Vaughn has potential, but also needs to screen his roles more in the future, selecting the best vehicle to display his acting ability.Jake Weber, as usual, plays it low-key, barely noticeable by most movie-goers.

What agent would see a strange piece of machinery, which is obviously part of the mutilation chamber in the killer's home and no one is working on checking that angle until said detective goes into the killer's mind to save the well experienced child psychologist from remaining trapped.  Then, like a revelation, he sees the symbol from the machinery in the killer's mind and connects it to the real world, calls his people to find the manufacturer.  In the 30 plus hours they had to crack into the killer's brain, the FBI still hadn't finished setting up a grid in the killer's tiny home and no one had bothered to examine the cellar, where they found the incriminating video.  Instead, the FBI had focused on the messy, tiny attic for the grid.The little boy - his father is wealthy and the boy is found on a seal island in a coma.  Why tell us any of that?  Why introduce his parents for 2 minutes and introduce a possible bad relationship between the kid's father and Lopez, then never examine either thing?I feel that Singh has a brilliant career ahead of him if only he can find a more polished screenwriter than Protosevitch, who also might have a career if he puts his own thoughts on his own stories rather than churning out bad imitations of other original screenplays.We already know Lopez has a glorious career ahead of her.  Between modeling, acting, and singing, we will be seeing her for years.  She needs to be more careful about script control.  This character could have been more interesting, but again that falls on a poor writer.  At least she isn't acting with snakes anymore.Vin D'Onofrio needs more vehicles to show his talents.  Certainly, when the bio of Stephen King is made, he should get the role!Vince Vaughn has potential, but also needs to screen his roles more in the future, selecting the best vehicle to display his acting ability.Jake Weber, as usual, plays it low-key, barely noticeable by most movie-goers.  Good character actor.

This movie makes the movie makes Flash Gordon (Sam Jones version) look like THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and The Last Star Fighter look like an Shakespearian epic.I find myself asking what were they thinking?  Couldn't you see this bomb a mile away?  I went to see this movie not having heard any of the bad review but good ones and the one that stands out in my mind is the review that said John Travolta is the new face of evil.  I said okay, I'll give it a shot and went out to see the movie.  After seeing it, I was like WAIT A SECOND!!!!!!!! Now let's go back to the year 1977.  People are standing in line around the block to see Star Wars A New Hope.  Now the movie has started, you see two of the biggest ships  you have ever seen, the good guys are running down the hall to fight the bad guys who suddenly storm in shooting.  The good guys are defeated and then out of the smoke comes this big, huge, gigantic man.  He is dressed all in black leather, wearing a mask that would make ancient Chinese warriors wet themselves and he has a huge cape on.  He steps in with authority and his men quickly come to attention at his presence.  He says nothing as he surveys the damage and then moves on.  From this point, you know this is the man who is in charge and this is a man that you do not want to mess with.  That is the face of evil.  Travolta looked like Lt. Commander Worf's, the Predator, Mili Vanili, and Jean Simmons (of KISS) love child from a wacked out orgy.One of my favorite scenes is when Johnny Goodboy's girlfriend decides to leave camp to help ol johnny and then she is captured and nearly put's johnny's life in danger.  And if I hear the word leverage one more time, I'm going to die.  What was Travolta's obsession with leverage.  What he needs is a nice Psycholos woman to help him get over his urges of leverage. Let's not forget about Fred Flintstone flying around in a Harrier Jet with Barney Rubble as his wing man.  And what's the deal with the dome?  First of all we destroy the dome but has someone forgotten the fact that our brave men and women are still in the dome fighting when it comes crashing down. And Travolta must have been the only excellent shot in the entire military because they couldn'taim straight to save their lives.  The only good part in the movie is the end and the scene where Forest Whitaker finally gets `leverage' over Travolta.  The rest of the movie is nothing but Travolta talking about `leverage', laughing hysterically at every stupid joke that you saw coming a mile away and then him giving Johnny Goodboy all the information he needs to win the war. Alexander the Great he is not.Anyway, before spending any of your hard earned money on this total flop, I would recommend doing something more useful with your time, such as watching moss grow or watching the birth of a newborn child by cesarean or maybe skinny dipping in zero degree weather.  Because you will regret having spent American money on this film. Some of you may have givin Battlefield Earth thumbs up and some thumbs down, but I give Battlefield Earth the finger. Both of them.

If you think the mindless platitudes spouted by the various and indistinguishable narrators in this film is poetic, then you must think Brittany Spears is more poetic than Shakespeare or Frost. Doesn't it bother anyone that every narrator regurgitates the same mindless drivel? Could anyone tell, from narration alone, which character was speaking? The idea that these narrations are supposed to be the thoughts of individual soldiers is about as believable as guests on the Jerry Springer Show using more than one multisyllabic word in the same sentence. Real WWII soldiers don't think, What is the face of nature? Do I know you? Are you my friend or my enemy? They think, How am I going to stay alive so that I can get back home to my family and friends? It is an insult to real WWII veterans to suppose that they thought the same thoughts as shallow models in Calvin Klein Cologne commercials.Number 2, One can't care about the characters. Characters in this film seem to have been an afterthought added at the end, as if the director made the film then said, Oh yeah. We need characters. Throw in a guy who fantasizes about his wife, a guy with a smirk who talks about inner strength, twenty guys who look scared, and a maniacal colonel. We'll pick up each character's story line at random, then dump it completely at the first opportunity. Characters, who needs 'em anyway? At the end of the film I was still seeing just a bunch of faces under metal helmets, not being able, or caring, to distinguish one from the other. It is understandable that this happens in the beginning of the film. But if, at the end, it is still happening, it is unforgivable.Number 3, It is boring.

Slow and methodical does not mean pointless and meandering, which is what this movie was.

It is also impossible to talk about such a film without discussing some the events that occurred.Lars Von Trier must be one of the most interesting directors working. This film is not only unique it is ultimately staggering. It starts out as one of those arty movies where middle-class types try to find their true selves by rebelling against the establishment and by taking advantage, upsetting and shocking others outside their group.The shock tactics of the group have some success, but does their behaviour really have the positive therapeutic effects they think it will have ?The characterisation is brilliant, Stoffer, Karen, Jeppe and others are quite superb, entirely believable it is like watching a documentary.The film say the the usual things about the restrictions imposed by middle-class lives, the desire to really express themselves free from protocol and exposing, as the group delightfully sees it, hypocrisy amongst others.To answer my earlier question, the 'idiots' play-acting has ultimately no therapeutic effects for anyone other than the existence of the group itself and the companionship, friendship and 'pleasure' it offered it's members. Otherwise, Stoffer, into rebellion and himself, gained nothing, Jeppe found love but would it last, most of group members were unable to carry on with their self-liberating play-acting outside of the group, and Karen's only - but important  - consolation was the fellowship she gained in the group.Karen's consolation carried her through to the final scene, as understated as it was, it went off like a hydrogen bomb, truly staggering. This is what Lars can do, he is an extremely clever man, anything he makes is worth watching. As for Karen's scene I have never seen a sadder, more poignant moment on screen about loss and suffering created so simply but with such force.There are one or two other punctuations in the movie, Stoffer going 'crazy', Jeppe's love interlude. The movie asks many questions and leaves the viewer to give the answers. Can you ever justify breaking one of the final taboos, pretending to have learning difficulties, and perhaps seemingly mocking the handicapped  ? This does not ever happen in the movie, except ironically via Stoffer's attitude on an occasion. Is the group's behaviour liberating and beneficial ?. How do people obtain comfort emotionally ? Lars lets us see answers to all these and more questions, brilliant.

It is also impossible to talk about such a film without discussing some the events that occurred.Lars Von Trier must be one of the most interesting directors working. This film is not only unique it is ultimately staggering. It starts out as one of those arty movies where middle-class types try to find their true selves by rebelling against the establishment and by taking advantage, upsetting and shocking others outside their group.The shock tactics of the group have some success, but does their behaviour really have the positive therapeutic effects they think it will have ?The characterisation is brilliant, Stoffer, Karen, Jeppe and others are quite superb, entirely believable it is like watching a documentary.The film say the the usual things about the restrictions imposed by middle-class lives, the desire to really express themselves free from protocol and exposing, as the group delightfully sees it, hypocrisy amongst others.To answer my earlier question, the 'idiots' play-acting has ultimately no therapeutic effects for anyone other than the existence of the group itself and the companionship, friendship and 'pleasure' it offered it's members. Otherwise, Stoffer, into rebellion and himself, gained nothing, Jeppe found love but would it last, most of group members were unable to carry on with their self-liberating play-acting outside of the group, and Karen's only - but important  - consolation was the fellowship she gained in the group.Karen's consolation carried her through to the final scene, as understated as it was, it went off like a hydrogen bomb, truly staggering. This is what Lars can do, he is an extremely clever man, anything he makes is worth watching.

USA, 2000, Directed by David McNally starring Piper Perabo, Adam Garcia, John Goodman.  I went to see this movie without my wife.  She decided from watching the trailers and see the ads that it was some dumb T&A drunk guy bar movie.  I mean that sounded OK to me; but I was really surprised.  `Coyote Ugly' is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year.  `Coyote Ugly' is the best romantic comedy that I've seen since `Notting Hill.' Violet Sanford (Perabo) is a young woman from small town New Jersey and she's moving to the Big Apple to seek fame and fortune as a song writer.  Her dad (Goodman) and her friends don't want her to leave.  Her best friend reminds her that they have never carried through on any of their dreams (preserving their virginity, going to college, going to beauty school) so why does she want to pursue her dream of being a famous songwriter?  But Violet is off to the city, where she naïvely goes from one agency to the other trying to sell her songs.  Needing to earn money she ends up working at `Coyote Ugly' serving drinks and dancing on the bar.  All the familiar plot points of a romantic comedy follow and you just know everything is going to end up happily ever after.  And it does.  But there are a number of things that make `Coyote Ugly' a good movie.  The acting is good.  John Goodman is especially good as Violet's father.  All the girls at the bar are good.  Garcia is good as the boyfriend and love interest.  Another thing I liked about the story is the persistence of the main character.  When life was getting her down, she'd have a good cry and go back out and kick some butt.  She stuck to her dream and worked hard to achieve it.  In the end she has friends, family, the promise of a carrier, and a boyfriend.  The more I think about this movie, it's not a movie for oafish guys who want a T&A moment.  `Coyote Ugly' is a movie that young girls should go see; a really good date movie; one of the best movies of 2000.

Audience titters at the UK premiere were also apparent at the unconvincing hand which the mutilated girl picks up between her teeth.

Even when asked what movie makes him laugh, Dana Carvey said without a doubt, Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstien is still one of my all time favorites. Mine too.

I won't belabor all of the inane mistakes made by the filmmakers; you'll have to read the Goofs page for most of them.Hollow Man is a great description of the men who created this dreck and stuck it up on cinema walls.  The movie starts off formulaic but interesting; it seems nothing intrigues like the idea of invisibility.  What would you do if you could make yourself completely invisible?  Apparently, the creators of this film would ogle women, fondle women, rape women, and then kill women.  Coming from Paul Verhoeven (Showgirls, Basic Instinct), this is starting to look like a pattern to me.  Any unsolved sexual attacks in Verhoeven's neighborhood lately?The last half of this movie then descends into bad acting, bad writing, and very bad science.  Besides what you see on the goofs page, here's a few highlights* After locking everyone into a freezer, Cane turns the temperature all the way down, and the temperature drops about thirty degrees in three or four seconds.  WRONG!* In said locker, Shue dithers around for a while, then makes an electromagnet out of a cardiac crash cart _while frost is forming everywhere_!  Can we say, SHOCK!!* After implausibly (at best) freeing herself and her boyfriend from the locker, and being surrounded by her dead friends, Shue leaps through the door into a pool of blood with an extremely perky and completely inappropriate grin on her face.  Look at me -- I'm a scientist!  Definitely one of the humor highlights of the film.* The boyfriend has the hook end of a crowbar buried into his stomach, but is able to survive when perky scientist Shue duct-tapes the wound closed.  (How's that for your typical male fantasy?  A sexy girlfriend with a genius IQ who likes duct tape.  If only she had brought the beer.)  A few minutes later, the boyfriend is able to hang from a ladder and pull Shue up to him with this tremendous tear in his abdominal muscles.* Shue sets a fire under one sprinkler head and all of them open up and spew water all over a metal floor.  Sprinkler heads are individually activated.  This would only set ONE head off. Doesn't anyone do research in Hollowwood?* Besides the infrared goggles magically appearing and disappearing throughout the film, when the team of geniuses decide they have to hunt Cane down, all but one of them takes off without the goggles.  The only one smart enough to go get one is the first one killed.  So much for Darwin's theory, huh?* If you were hunting down an invisible man and you had IR goggles, wouldn't you turn out the lights so he couldn't see you coming????I give this a 3 only for the special effects, which were very well done.  Everything and everyone else in this movie stinks, and someone needs to get Verhoeven and the writers some therapy.

Plus, more importantly, it's a great character exploration.  While other people have noted that the characters almost never talk about what they're doing or why they're doing it and are also rather expressionless (which is very much in character for both of them), the movie uses a different means of revealing character  it allows the characters to do absolutely anything.

These show that he is protective of and jealous for Eris, and that there is no limit to what he'll do for her; few hollywood heroes have been able to prove their emotions so fully.Basically, I'd say that it's the story of someone who is already outside the law (for his job) and who takes a step further and becomes a law in and of itself.  There have been a lot of stories where heroes have done this for revenge or for their perception of the good of society.
