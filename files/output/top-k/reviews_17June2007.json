The screenplay is so good that even if it was directed by Joel Schumacher, who is a horrible director, its power cannot be diminished. I love the tone and the pacing and the general concept of the story. The ending, at Machine's house, is truly suspenseful. Some scenes are genuinely heartbreaking. There's nothing happy happy about this story. The only thing that prevents it from being great (aside from the sometimes pedestrian direction from Joel) is the presence of Nicholas Cage.I always have difficulty accepting Cage in any normal role. Nic usually excels in neurotic roles but in 8MM, he plays a normal guy, a private detective, who is slowly lead into a dark world with almost no point of return. The story needed an actor who could play a dull normal of sorts who becomes obsessed with his new case and is seduced by a dark side within him, a side he never knew existed in him. One of the many tragic aspects of the story is watching a married man with a newborn baby go over the edge and lose all sense of what's good and what's wrong. This aspect about the story automatically makes the casting of Cage a mistake does anyone really believe Cage as a nice guy who never explored his dark side? Any other actor would have been a better choice than Cage, who seems to confuse normal with lifeless. He's such a non-presence here that the film almost falters irremediably because of it. The role needed an actor who was able to emote internally as he becomes more and more involved with the story. We needed to see him change gradually and see him fight with his internal demons, which never really happens with Cage. He has a blank expression almost throughout the entire film. Things aren't help much with Joaquin's star-making role stealing the film from right under Cage's feet.The other awful aspect about 8MM is the villain played by Peter Stormare. He 's way too camp to be 100% believable here. He almost looks like a villain who belongs in a, huh, BATMAN movie. I don't blame Stormare but Schumacher's direction here. His character should have been more subtle and Schumacher couldn't help but include some campy element in the grim story.But aside from those weak aspects, 8MM is one of my favorite stories ever. Notice that I didn't say films. Like I already said, the film is pretty good but the story itself is great. Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplays is one of my favorites. I like the story so much that I downloaded the screenplay from the web and read it. It's that good. It's well reported that Walker and Schumacher fought during production and I definitely believe this happened. What could have been a great one-of-a-kind film was turned into just a good thriller with some really thought provoking ideas in it. It's a shame really. But as it is it's still worth watching, certainly for fans of Joaquin.

But it is a truly absorbing effort nonetheless, and one that I wouldn't pass up if it arrived on TV at some random moment in time. For all of Parker's dips into the kinds of montage-style editing that he perfected in the Wall, it's also in some small bits with a documentary feel, and in the most part a mood that melds together those dark crevices and corridors and alleys and shadows that one finds in the best of the film-noir period with the same dark tendencies of the supernatural film. It's even got a very typical 'noir' set-up- gleefully typical in actuality- as private eye Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is sent by Louis Cyphre (ho-ho, though not as such played by the totally dead-pan De Niro) to seek out a man who welshed on a contract signed with him. It leads him through Harlem, then to New Orleans, into a whole web of black magic, voodoo, and sinister figures on his trail, and other skeletons in the closet to find.Parker's style is meant to ratchet up the questions raised in the viewer as the film progresses, and as any good twisty thriller goes it deepens these questions by the complexity of the protagonist, leading to the final twist that one may have seen done in quite a number of films since, but does retain its power as something of a dark catharsis for this character. Parker's success here rests on two facets his blending of a mood of the nature of the people and of New Orleans in general, how people on the street, or in the voodoo dance at night, aren't overdone into some cliché but are shown as they are, as figures in this quasi-limbo Angel has gotten himself into. The other being the casting or Rourke and De Niro. The former gives Angel Heart much of its appeal it's almost too easy to see Rourke as a gum-shoe, but here he plays it as a person cynical and witty, but also sort of damaged goods, hiding past wounds with a cigarette and look of the eyes. And as things become crazier all around him, little by little one sees the wear and tear on his psyche, until the final scenes when he breaks down into the other side of his tough guy act- vulnerability. De Niro, on the other hand, is so sinister in what he doesn't do. Considering how over the top his contemporaries- Nicholson and Pacinio- went with the role of the devil himself, this may be the most subdued of them all, which makes it all the more chilling (see the egg scene), with the Scorsese-esquire beard a good asset.Although the casting isn't altogether perfect- Rampling is given an all too brief role to work wit, the minor characters being reasonably well suited for the atmosphere, and Lisa Bonet being just about adequate, though not quite the same caliber as Rourke, in her role as a mysterious bayou teen who is the daughter of the suspect in question- having these two heavyweights under Parker's command is quite staggering for any movie fan to enjoy. It's a strange feat to accomplish, but somehow Angel Heart holds up since its release twenty years ago as a genre hybrid sleeper, where the hardest- and darkest- thing to find is probably right inside of oneself.

It looks like it cost a billion bucks to make. The sets by Ken Adams are amazing (he should have won an Oscar for them). The locations are stunning. The fx are well made and still hold up today. The women are above average gorgeous (they all look like supermodels before supermodels were in). All of this beautifully filmed by cinematographer Jean Tournier. I love watching MOONRAKER just because it's so damn gorgeous to look at. I don't know how many times I saw it at the movies when it came out just to appreciate the beauty of it all. Unfortunately, we are talking about a James Bond film and of course there has to be the usual formulaic stuff seen in every other James Bond film. Basically, MOONRAKER is a remake of YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME. I always preferred MOONRAKER over the schintzy SPY WHO LOVED ME, which was made just before this one. Lewis Gilbert directed those three Bond films and MOONRAKER is his crowning achievement. Personally speaking, Gilbert is a bad director. His films are always bloated and sorta soulless and yet still gorgeous. Aside from his Bond films, he rarely made an impression with his other films. In fact, he's the one who directed THE ADVENTURERS, which is a good looking film but it's really, really awful. I'm glad Gilbert stopped making Bond films. He was always too laid back for action films like this.There ARE a lot of memorable scenes in MOONRAKER the entire intro is now a classic and much better than the one in SWLM. Corinne being chased by dogs. The simulator scene. Bond fighting with Chang in Venice. My favorite scene is when Bond and Goodhead are stuck below a shuttle's rockets and are about to be burned alive. A near perfect action moment there. The climax in space is fun if improbable. I love the scene when they have to destroy those globes as they re-enter the atmosphere. Really suspenseful. But as good as those scenes are individually they almost don't register as a whole because the story and direction are so lackadaisical, so relax. It's like everyone was on vacation. There's absolutely no grit to this film. It's really sleek and smooth but nearly bite-less. The whole story seems to be just a preamble to the action set in space. What really stands out about MOONRAKER are the many long moments with no dialogue. I'd say about 50 to 60% of the film has no dialogue. Just music and sound effects. It's almost a silent film. Moore didn't have a lot of dialogue to remember and this was an easy film to dub. The story is as easy as connect-the-dots The British owned Moonraker 5 disappears in mid-air and 007 is sent to California to investigate its disappearance. At the Moonraker plant in California (France really) Bond find blueprints of vials which leads him to Venice, where the vials are fabricated. And from Venice Bond goes to Brazil where the vials, filled with deadly nerve gas, are shipped to the underground layout of Drax (boringly played by the usually reliable Michael Lonsdale. Love the name Drax though). Oh and we learn that Drax wants to create a new race of super humans by killing everyone on earth by dropping those nerve gas filled globes from space while Drax and his super humans reside in Drax's space station. I actually like that part of the story and some of the grandeur of it (Drax wanting to be God) is actually achieved with the striking visuals and the amazingly lush score by the brilliant John Barry. Unfortunately, again, this is a James Bond film and thought provoking ideas are set aside for formulaic action. I wish this wasn't a James Bond film. Take away all the Bond elements, the stupid humor, flesh out the screenplay and this would be a spectacular kick ass science fiction film.Anyway, back to James Bond.I really like Lois Chiles as Holly Goodhead. She's my favorite Bond girl ever. Beautiful and sophisticated but tough. She's no bimbo. I remember a lot of my friends in school didn't like her because they thought she was too tough for a babe. I guess Holly Goodhead was Girl Power before Girl Power was in. For me, Chiles epitomizes everything chic and sexy about the late 1970s. She's unforgettable in that black jumpsuit. But the Holly Goodhead role is a really badly written one. She's almost an afterthought to the whole story. They basically needed a character to fly the space shuttle and Bond into space (something 007 obviously couldn't do) and Goodhead was basically that just a pilot. Then there's Corinne Clery who is truly gorgeous but sadly, again, her role is minimal. Then there's the not so beautiful Jaws. Jaws was so popular in SPY WHO LOVED ME they brought him back here. I don't mind this but they turned him into a good guy and he even falls in love with a ditsy girl. This part of MOONRAKER is *really* bad. Someone should completely edit that storyline out of the movie and its rating would go up exponentially. And like in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, the musical in-jokes were needlessly distracting.These bad aspects about MOONRAKER are almost negligible though because the film is such a visual (and aural) feast. Whether it's one of the best or worst of the series, I really don't care. I can positively state though that this is THE best looking Bond film ever, with an actually cool science fiction story somewhere in it. I give MOONRAKER 10 stars for the look of it all but 5 stars for the laid back and sometimes silly direction. So an average of 7 stars.

Oh and we learn that Drax wants to create a new race of super humans by killing everyone on earth by dropping those nerve gas filled globes from space while Drax and his super humans reside in Drax's space station. I actually like that part of the story and some of the grandeur of it (Drax wanting to be God) is actually achieved with the striking visuals and the amazingly lush score by the brilliant John Barry. Unfortunately, again, this is a James Bond film and thought provoking ideas are set aside for formulaic action. I wish this wasn't a James Bond film. Take away all the Bond elements, the stupid humor, flesh out the screenplay and this would be a spectacular kick ass science fiction film.Anyway, back to James Bond.I really like Lois Chiles as Holly Goodhead. She's my favorite Bond girl ever. Beautiful and sophisticated but tough. She's no bimbo. I remember a lot of my friends in school didn't like her because they thought she was too tough for a babe. I guess Holly Goodhead was Girl Power before Girl Power was in. For me, Chiles epitomizes everything chic and sexy about the late 1970s. She's unforgettable in that black jumpsuit. But the Holly Goodhead role is a really badly written one. She's almost an afterthought to the whole story. They basically needed a character to fly the space shuttle and Bond into space (something 007 obviously couldn't do) and Goodhead was basically that just a pilot. Then there's Corinne Clery who is truly gorgeous but sadly, again, her role is minimal. Then there's the not so beautiful Jaws. Jaws was so popular in SPY WHO LOVED ME they brought him back here. I don't mind this but they turned him into a good guy and he even falls in love with a ditsy girl. This part of MOONRAKER is *really* bad. Someone should completely edit that storyline out of the movie and its rating would go up exponentially. And like in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, the musical in-jokes were needlessly distracting.These bad aspects about MOONRAKER are almost negligible though because the film is such a visual (and aural) feast. Whether it's one of the best or worst of the series, I really don't care. I can positively state though that this is THE best looking Bond film ever, with an actually cool science fiction story somewhere in it. I give MOONRAKER 10 stars for the look of it all but 5 stars for the laid back and sometimes silly direction. So an average of 7 stars.

The result, a huge franchise that has launched into a huge success. Spider-man is a terrific movie with good casting, a good story, a good theme song (courtesy of The Amazing Danny Elfman), and amazing special effects.Tobey Maguire fills the role of Peter Parker perfectly. He has the appearance and the attitude of a young Peter Parker. His appearance is enough to convince me he is good for the role. He looks like he was born for the part and he does a fantastic job of filling it. I have been somewhat skeptical about Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. I never pictured her as being the Mary Jane type physically although she does a good job with the part. I have always been skeptical with James Franco as well. I do not think he did a fantastic job as Harry Osborne and I still ponder on him being cast (although he had a much better portrayal in Spider-man 3). His character just seems to outgoing, to selfish, and almost annoying(?). Willem Dafoe, in my opinion, stole the show. He plays Norman Osborne and the villainous Green Goblin. An absolutely perfect choice for the character. He has the anger to play the character and the ability to transform characters (From Osborne to the Goblin) easily and perfectly. His mental psyche is absolutely perfect for the character. I will admit, I did not really like his costume, but that is just his costume! His character is perfect! And there is some comic relief in this film, J.K. Simmons plays an unforgettable and perfect J. Jonah Jameson (editor in chief of the daily bugle).The story is very good though I feel the movie starts out awkward. I do not like how they really rush into Spider-man's transformation and the movie seems somewhat off tempo to start. The entire initial movie sequence up to when Peter's Uncle Ben confronts him in the car seems just rushed. After that, it seems like the movie moves more smoothly. Other than that, there is little I have to dislike about the film. The special effects are amazing and the design work done on Spidey's costume is terrific. The fight sequences are great and the final showdown between Spidey and the Goblin is awesome. The entertainment in this movie is high quality. Spider-man is a hero people feel they can relate to. He has duties that he feels he must commit to as a superhero and he faces real life challenges and personal problems outside of that life. This movie does a great job of capturing that.Whether you think of Spider-man as being Amazing or Spectacular, either of these words can be used to describe the Spider-man film.

You'll never see anything remotely like this again, and if you do then it will be naught but a poor ripoff. It's the story of a man named Jody, who is tricked and kidnapped by the Irish Army and held there for three days as a hostage. He will be killed on the third day if the English government does not release a captive of their own. He is watched over by a timid, quiet young man named Fergus, who he asks to visit his lady friend, Dil, after he dies, to tell her 'that he was thinking of her.' After Fergus slips up and Jody dies, Fergus obeys Jody's last wish and goes to see Dil. The two become closer, but both of them are holding secrets...This movie was obviously very well made. Very touching, even with the little 'surprise twist' thrown in halfway through it. The performances by Stephen Rea and Jaye Davidson were amazing, and Jody (Forest Whitaker) was a great character too, very believable. The film is a groundbreaking one emotionally, probably better then the most polished and mainstream normal romance films. The emotional depth is stunning, despite the...nature...of it.You have to watch this film with an open mind. Because if you don't, you'll be very offended and most likely dislike it. It's a very strange film and not for the weak-hearted. Filled with cursing and heavy sexuality, it's not one for fans of timid romance-dramas. This one's original. Some very violent scenes too, like when Jude is murdered. A very deserved death.Now onto my problems with the film. OK, so the twist in it makes it very original and dramatic. Yeah. But what about the other side of the plot? The assassination plot of the Irish army. Who is the old man? Why do they want to kill him? They never revealed this; focusing far too much on the drama between Fergus and Dil and not enough on the militaristic side of the plot. They did not even fully flesh THAT out. What about the relationship between Dil and Jody? It was very foggy and unclear for the duration of the film. The movie tried too hard to be innovative, and it succeeded. But there were several factors that brought the movie down, and it truly could've been better then it was.Overall though, this is a great movie and truly one you have to see at least once in your lifetime. I'm not going to proclaim that it's a masterpiece, or the best movie ever made, but it's unique, and I promise that you'll never see anything like this again.

Stewart must show that the Lieutenant was temporary insane, a task that is not made easy by the overzealous of the prosecution team.What Otto Preminger does with this film is give no affirmative answer at the end of it, it is left up to the audience to decide what is the truth and he doesn't tell the audience one side is lier's and the other isn't, there is evidence that supports both the rape happening and the Lieutenant being temporary insane when he killed Quill and evidence that contradicts the story the Lieutenant and his wife has given the court.The supported evidence is the bruises the wife had after the attack. Tourists heard the screams. The police believed the wife. The police saw car tracks and dog tracks where the wife said the attack happened. Also, they find where her glass case fell, near to the rape. She took a lie detector test. Her ripped panties are found in the laundry, right next to Quill's room. The doctor can't be certain, one way or the other that she was raped. At that time 1959, it was hard to determine this especially with a mature married woman. The Army doctor said Manion was temporary insane. The dead man was a very good marksman and had guns behind the bar.The evidence that doesn't support the wife and Manion is there were no witnesses to the rape. The wife's conduct before and after the rape, she is very flirty. She wore tight clothes and seemed to touch the dead man in some sexual way. When she is telling Stewart her story, there is no emotion, she is not upset talking about it. There are the hidden looks between the husband and wife that seem to say there is more to the story then they are telling. The wife is obviously scared of her husband and she has been hit by her husband before. She swore on a crucifix so her husband would believe her and that seems to say that he didn't believe her before she swore on it. The prosecution doctor says Manion wasn't temporary insane and the eye witness backs this up by saying he was calm and cool when he killed Quill and even threatened him. Manion is clearly jealous of men who show his wife any attention.In the end, Manion is found Not guilty but there is no overall thing that says what truly happened and it makes a refreshing difference that the audience watching the film has to think what might have been the true events.I don't agree this was James Stewart's last best film, he carried on his stealer performances in other films and TV roles after this film. Lee Remick is brilliant as Laura Manion who has two sides to her personality, she likes men and can come across as a tigress and then she has a vulnerable side who is lonely at times. George C. Scott has a small role as a state Attorney who is trying to help the prosecuting attorney convict the Lieutenant.The music fits so well with the film, music by Duke Ellington who plays a cameo in the film as Pie eye.The film keeps the audience guessing and makes you pay attention throughout to get you to think and decide what you believe. I can understand why the film was considered racy at the time because it mentions sperm, contraceptive, climax, penetration, bitch and slut and it shows the ripped panties but it is pretty tame compared to the films that have followed such as The Accused but I say well done to all the people who worked on it as they didn't try to shy away from any aspect of the rape and that must have been a hard thing to do with the society being what is was when the film was being made.

However under the calm & calculating exterior Patrick has psychological problems as he has a violent blood-lust which he satisfies by killing people he has contempt for & he also likes perverted sex sessions with prostitutes (then again who wouldn't?). His latest victim Paul Allen (Jared Leto) is missed & his fiancé hires private detective Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe) to find him, will Patrick be exposed as the homicidal maniac that he is or can he get away with it...This American Canadian co-production was co-written & directed by Mary Harron & I have to say that I didn't think that much of it despite it's reputation. The social satire laden script by Harron & Guinevere Turner who played Elisabeth the high class prostitute in the film was based on the controversial novel of the same name by Bret Easton Ellis & I just don't 'get' it's appeal or why anyone would particularly want to sit down & watch it, overall I think it's quite a dull & repetitive film with some nice dialogue & a few decent scenes which save it from total banality. Some of Bateman's monologues along with the amusing yet pointless speeches about the merits of 80's pop groups & the style of people's business cards are pretty funny at times if trivial & if your looking for some sex & nudity then American Psycho might do it for you. I was expecting more in the horror department if I'm honest, there's barely a drop of blood in it & certainly nothing graphic, pretty much all of the character's are very unlikeable & one dimensional with Willem Dafoe's cop getting about three scenes before he is completely dropped & I also thought it was boring with pretty much the same thing happening scene after scene. I wasn't impressed by the ambiguous ending either which tries to be clever but I just found it frustrating as it never clarifies if it was all in Bateman's imagination. Personally I didn't think it was anything to write home about but there does seem to be a lot of people out there who like it, so maybe I just went into it with the wrong expectations & quite simply it's just not for me.Director Harron does OK, there's a nice elegance to the way this is shot with nice camera slick moves. The film nails the whole 80's yuppie thing very well as these unlikeable people spend money like water, care for nothing or no one but themselves & have beautiful apartments for which I'm very jealous. I found myself becoming bored with all the yuppie satire going on & again it just felt very repetitive. I wouldn't say there's anything scary here or even particularly that violent although there are a couple of fairly strong sex scenes.With a supposed budget of about $8,000,000 this looks nice enough with sleek & stylish cinematography but what does that matter when the film did so little for me? Set in New York it was actually mostly filmed in Ontario in Canada. The acting is OK, I don't really know if I liked Christian Bale's performance or not. Willem Dafoe is utterly wasted in a nothing part.American Psycho is trying to be a complex dark thriller which wants to say something about 80's upper class society in New York, I'm sorry but weren't the 80's like 20 years ago? I'm sure there are many out there who like or even love this film & I'm proud to say right here & now that I'm not one of them, average at best & an irrelevant bore at worst.

My feelings about the film are somewhat mixed - of course the songs are fantastic and beautifully executed and the Hawaii scenery is magnificent. My main negative contentions are firstly, like everyone else I have read, the use of coloured ( mainly yellow ) filters on numerous occasions. It is a sacrilege to distort beautiful views of Hawaii with colourized filters and I cannot imagine which nutter had this hair brained idea - presumably they wanted to be innovative at the time but the frequency of these filtered passages spoils much of the film - an occasional use of filters is OK for a particular situation or to make an isolated point but, used so often, it becomes tiring, irksome and frankly annoying. The storyline is a little confused to start with and, quite frankly is rather slow - the beautiful music does compensate for this up to a certain point but I did have an overall feeling of slowness. Other incomprehensible things are for example using Rossano Brazzi ( pukka Italian ) as a Frenchman - his accent is so obviously Italian that it just does not ring true. If they wanted to use Brazzi absolutely, he should have been cast as an Italian planter and not as French. There are some good love scenes though, notably a fairly erotic one between Cable and Liat though it seems to me a little implausible that love could develop between them so quickly as they hardly knew each other just a short time before the scene in question. Some commentators here have discussed the absence or non of racism in the film - I will not fall into this trap as I am sure that the film is for entertainment value and is not trying to make some social point - problem is that nowadays a certain number of people mostly in the USA or Western Europe are now obsessed by racism, its presence or its absence - this to me translates a certain state of mental obsession and deterioration and they would be well advised to take the film for what it is - entertainment. Whether someone chooses to fall in love with someone of their own race or of another is entirely a personal matter for them and is not a matter for endless sterile discussions and preaching. To return to the film, as I saw it on DVD, it was in Cinemascope 220 therefore with large black bars on the TV - better than nothing but I would have liked to a see a version in 43 Pan and Scan to compare. Unfortunately the DVD does not provide this possibility and what a shame it is as many of the USA DVD's do propose films in BOTH formats, something which is sadly lacking on European DVD's ( which is why I buy most of mine in the USA ). One obviously has to accept the film as it is but if there was one thing I would change, it would be to get rid of those damned filters !!

It is a sacrilege to distort beautiful views of Hawaii with colourized filters and I cannot imagine which nutter had this hair brained idea - presumably they wanted to be innovative at the time but the frequency of these filtered passages spoils much of the film - an occasional use of filters is OK for a particular situation or to make an isolated point but, used so often, it becomes tiring, irksome and frankly annoying. The storyline is a little confused to start with and, quite frankly is rather slow - the beautiful music does compensate for this up to a certain point but I did have an overall feeling of slowness. Other incomprehensible things are for example using Rossano Brazzi ( pukka Italian ) as a Frenchman - his accent is so obviously Italian that it just does not ring true. If they wanted to use Brazzi absolutely, he should have been cast as an Italian planter and not as French. There are some good love scenes though, notably a fairly erotic one between Cable and Liat though it seems to me a little implausible that love could develop between them so quickly as they hardly knew each other just a short time before the scene in question. Some commentators here have discussed the absence or non of racism in the film - I will not fall into this trap as I am sure that the film is for entertainment value and is not trying to make some social point - problem is that nowadays a certain number of people mostly in the USA or Western Europe are now obsessed by racism, its presence or its absence - this to me translates a certain state of mental obsession and deterioration and they would be well advised to take the film for what it is - entertainment. Whether someone chooses to fall in love with someone of their own race or of another is entirely a personal matter for them and is not a matter for endless sterile discussions and preaching. To return to the film, as I saw it on DVD, it was in Cinemascope 220 therefore with large black bars on the TV - better than nothing but I would have liked to a see a version in 43 Pan and Scan to compare. Unfortunately the DVD does not provide this possibility and what a shame it is as many of the USA DVD's do propose films in BOTH formats, something which is sadly lacking on European DVD's ( which is why I buy most of mine in the USA ). One obviously has to accept the film as it is but if there was one thing I would change, it would be to get rid of those damned filters !!

Those were the first words to come to mind after this awful movie finished for the first and last time on my computer screen. Nightmare on Elm St. had gone noticeably downhill after it's cult-classic of a first film, but I doubt anybody expected this horrible aberration. Nobody expected this cosmic joke of a film, and nobody is more distraught about it than I am.This is by far the worst ANOES film of the lot. It doesn't seem too bad at the beginning, with a genuinely creepy intro and a rather elongated shower scene featuring Alice. But then we hit rock bottom right at the beginning with bad acting and a jumbled sequence of events. I mean, sure, Freddy movies are supposed to be dreamlike and creepy, but this one is like a train-wreck in it's poor sequencing of events and awful plot setup. It feels like you're coming down with a terrible headache, not like you're getting scared. So the directing totally fails. None of the suspense and well crafted horror from previous sequels is found here, and even the death scenes are mostly just crass and moronic (the death by food especially), except for that one cool scene that's crafted like a comic book battle. That's why this movie gets a point.The storyline...lame, lame, lame, LAME. It was an excuse to gross people out and to make the MPAA mad, and nothing more.The acting...should I mention how Freddy has been turned into a childish boogey-man-like clown figure? How his rebirth scene made him look like a monster out of a 7 year old's horror book instead of the foreboding and nightmarish dream killer we've all known and loathed since the first film? That arm waving and stupid chuckling as he appeared again...ugh. And his one liners, too. Throughout the whole movie, they suck. Badly. A grade-schooler could come up with funnier stuff then the vomit Freddy spews throughout the 90 minute duration of the film. Hell, a chimpanzee could come up with much funnier lines than what Freddy's been told to say here. Who wrote the script for this? This movie is really irritating, too. It seems so pointless. Like a gnat buzzing around your head, a gnat that just WON'T go away. Freddy is just an annoyance now. We've seen him so many times before. This one's nothing different, and a lot of the time you just want him to take his awful one-liners and get off your TV screen. Alice, instead of the thoughtful and quiet girl from the last movie, seems annoying and very shallow, and this is obviously due to the horrible, horrible script this movie was fitted with. Lisa Wilcox may be a great actor, and sometimes it shines through the cracks here, but she can't save this movie. The other actors just suck, mostly.The last 15 or 20 minutes of Freddy's existence in this film are awful and embarrassing. I hope Englund was ashamed of this. Who wants to see Freddy running around like a mutated gorilla with his limbs stretched out, laughing like a cartoon villain? This movie destroyed anything positive I felt for the Nightmare series. I can't ever watch them again without this image running through my head; of the mangled cartoon abomination that Krueger became. He was slowly becoming a jokey, retarded pop culture icon, but this is the lowest of the low. This is rock bottom. Nobody will ever take Freddy Krueger seriously again after seeing this film. He's naught but a joke, a clown that is long overdue for retirement. Pathetic.Of all the movies I could hate, why did it have to be Nightmare on Elm St, a series which I once adored and liked a lot? The Dream Child represents the death of a legend, and the shattering of any hope I had in the Nightmare on Elm St. series. Freddy would go on to continue his downward spiral into clown status in the next installment, Freddy's Dead (which was more entertaining than this was, actually), and then he would go on to bring down the mood in Freddy VS Jason, and finally he would putter out into nothing, which is for the best.I know this has mostly been a rant about why Freddy sucks now, but this movie is overall, horrible, and one of the worst movies ever made.

Many of his most fondly-remembered films are often categorised as film-making experiments 'Rear Window' took place entirely in the one small apartment; 'Rope' was played out almost in real time, and was envisioned as a one-take movie; 'Lifeboat' takes place exclusively on a tiny lifeboat in the middle of the wide ocean. However, in my view at least, to categorise these films as mere experiments is to take away from the worth of the film itself. Hitchcock did not simply exploit these unusual scenarios as a mere gimmick to pique audience interest; he used them to his advantage, to maximise the emotional resonance of his films. And he did it better than anybody else could possibly envision.After an Allied freighter is torpedoed by a German U-Boat during World War Two, a handful of survivors of differing personalities and beliefs clamber aboard an unsturdy lifeboat and await rescue. Among the survivors is the Nazi captain of the U-Boat which sunk their ship, and the men and women must decide whether this member of the enemy is trustworthy enough to remain on the boat. As the days drag on and on without a hint of rescue, and with supplies of food and water rapidly dwindling, some survivors forge lifelong bonds with each other, whilst others slowly and surely turn against one another. Meanwhile, the crafty, innocent-seeming German, Willy (Walter Slezak), imperceptibly begins to draw his plans against his rescuers.A lesser director might have baulked under the task of making a continually-suspenseful 96-minute film set entirely in a lifeboat. Hitchcock, however, used the situation to his advantage, and the tiny set on which 'Lifeboat' was filmed (allegedly the smallest in film history), creates a constricting, claustrophobic atmosphere. The surrounding ocean landscape, presumably simulated using the director's favoured rear-projection, is surprisingly convincing throughout, with the black-and-white photography masking the obviousness of the effect which is often apparent in Hitchcock's later films. During filming, the cast members were exposed to the elements, which aided the realism of their performances, but also led to frequent illnesses such as seasickness and pneumonia.Solid performances were crucial to the film, and, luckily, the casting here is spot-on. Tallulah Bankhead gives perhaps the stand-out performance as Connie Porter, the selfish and arrogant world-travelling author. Each biting remark is delivered with magnificent pretentious poise, and many have suggested that Bankhead's character is not too different from the actress' own persona. The roles of the other survivors are played very well by William Bendix, Mary Anderson, John Hodiak, Henry Hull, Hume Cronyn and Canada Lee, whilst Walter Slezak delivers a remarkable performance as the sly but strangely-likable German captain, whom you know isn't trustworthy, but you are tempted to trust him anyway.Upon its release, 'Lifeboat' was interpreted by many critics to be pro-Nazi, and its box-office performance was poor. Nowadays, the film is more often seen to be quite the opposite, as a piece of American propaganda&#133; and a good one at that. Based on a story by iconic American author John Steinbeck, one of the film's main themes is how dark situations can bring out the worst in a civilised group of people. When the Nazi captain is first hauled aboard the lifeboat, wealthy factory owner Charles D. Rittenhouse (Hull) fervently calls for the man to be treated civilly, as a prisoner of war. However, after witnessing the devious exploits of the Nazi, his attitudes perceptibly change. At the end of the film, when a young German seaman clambers aboard the boat, he is among the first to demand that he is tossed overboard like a worthless animal.The film's depiction of the enemy is quite interesting, though it is certainly not overly positive as many critics originally suggested. Willy, a fascinating character, is at first treated with some sympathy, but all this is cast aside when it is revealed that he has been hoarding food, water and a compass for his own benefit. The final line of the film, Connie's What are we going to do about people who think like this? in response to the young Nazi's asking whether or not they are going to kill him, carries a certain note of irony. The characters consider the Germans to be barbaric for even thinking of such a thing, and yet the American survivors had almost been all-too-willing to murder Willy from the moment he came aboard the lifeboat. Perhaps the film is saying that, when it all comes down to it, the Germans and Allies weren't really all that different.

When the Nazi captain is first hauled aboard the lifeboat, wealthy factory owner Charles D. Rittenhouse (Hull) fervently calls for the man to be treated civilly, as a prisoner of war. However, after witnessing the devious exploits of the Nazi, his attitudes perceptibly change. At the end of the film, when a young German seaman clambers aboard the boat, he is among the first to demand that he is tossed overboard like a worthless animal.The film's depiction of the enemy is quite interesting, though it is certainly not overly positive as many critics originally suggested. Willy, a fascinating character, is at first treated with some sympathy, but all this is cast aside when it is revealed that he has been hoarding food, water and a compass for his own benefit. The final line of the film, Connie's What are we going to do about people who think like this? in response to the young Nazi's asking whether or not they are going to kill him, carries a certain note of irony. The characters consider the Germans to be barbaric for even thinking of such a thing, and yet the American survivors had almost been all-too-willing to murder Willy from the moment he came aboard the lifeboat. Perhaps the film is saying that, when it all comes down to it, the Germans and Allies weren't really all that different. Now there's a social commentary that wouldn't have been looked upon too kindly during the early 1940s!

Like Franz Kafka and Vincent Van Gogh Ed Wood, Johnny Depp, was never recognized as the genius that he was until he had to die and then be discovered by millions of film lovers. People who for the most part were born long after he wrote directed and starred in his last film.Following his life long dream of making movies Ed Wood started out as man with ideas that were just to far out for anyone in the Hollywood of the early 1950's to take seriously. It was in 1952 when Ed saw a story in the newspapers about former combat veteran Chris Jorgenson having a sex change operation that got him interested. Ed, being a closet transvestite, decided to do a movie about Jorgenso and secretly about himself. Going from studio to studio all Ed got was the run around and door slammed, or laugh at, in his face. It wasn't until he ran into washed up movie horror king Bela Lugosi ,Martin Laundau, fitting himself for a coffin at a L.A funeral home that things started to turn around for the young and hungry director.The movie Ed Wood centers around the friendship that was developed by Ed Wood and, at the time, the highly morphine addicted Bela Lugosi. Bela who hadn't made a movie in four years was now on his last legs and it was Ed who gave him the chance to revived his career which he did in three unforgettable films that Wood directed 1.Glen or Glenda 2. Bride of the Monster and 3. In a cameo role in what many people consider to be Wood's Citizan Kane the film that they broke the mold after he made it Plan 9 from Outer Space.Were also introduced in Ed Wood to Ed's two wives Doloros Fuller, Sarah Jessica Parker, who left Ed when he gave her a supporting, not leading, role in his classic Bride of the Monster and also Kathy O'Hara, Patricia Arquette, who met Ed when he was at the hospital having his friend Bela dry out and kick his drug habit. Kathy turned out to be Ed's real and true love of his life who, unlike Dolores, stood by him through thick and thin and never left his side up until he suddenly collapsed and died from a heart-attack on the evening of December 10, 1978.Having his first big success with Glen and Glenda in 1953 Ed set out to do films that would give his friend Bela Lugosi, who was the puppet master in that film, something to really stick his teeth into and came up with Bride of the Monster in 1954. Getting together a number of aspiring actors and actresses, like Tony McCoy Loretta King & 400 pound ex professional wrestler Tor Johnson, to play in the movie it took almost a year until Ed could get the money to finally finish the project.Bride of the Monster was not the smashing success, financially not artistically, that Ed hoped it would be but watching it now, like those who were lucky or brave enough to see it back then in 1955,it really stood the test of time after all these years. Seeing the great Bela Lugosi in what turned out to be his last speaking role and very possibly the signature performance of his career, as the insane and at the same time sympathetic Dr. Eric Vornoff, that's filled with so much tension electricity and passion that it completely blows away anyone who watches it. Bela delivering his unforgettable I Have'a no Home speech to his bitter rival in the movie Professor Strowski has to be seen, and heard, to be believed. Not to take anything away from actor Martin Landau, who received a Academy Award for his part as Bela Lugosi, you have to see Bela himself deliver he lines in the movie Bride of the Monster to really appreciate what a great actor he really was and, with Ed Wood's writing and directing, again became in the twilight of his magnificent film career. Even Marlon Brando at his absolute best couldn't come close to duplicate Bela's unbelievable performance in that movie!With no worlds left to conquer after classics like Bride of the Monster jailbate  The Violent Years and Glen or Glenda already in the can Ed went out to make the movie that he would forever be identified with Plan 9 from Outer Space. Sadly enough he wouldn't have Bela Lugosi, who died just as the filming began, to star in it. Touching funny as well as heart-breaking story of the Great Ed Wood Jr who had to die, after being laughed snickered and scorned at while he was still alive, to be recognized and become the film and movie genius that he is today. The movie wisely ends just as Ed has his greatest success at the opening of his forgotten, and now rediscovered, anti-war and anti-nuclear testing sci-fi classic Plan 9 from Outer Space. It was fitting to end the movie Ed Wood before we saw him, and his great talents, go downhill leaving him a broken and forgotten man who was left to sneaking out of one apartment and into another to prevent himself from being thrown out for not paying his rent. It's even sadder that Ed Wood didn't live long enough to get the appreciation that he so rightfully deserved to get from the movie going public. If there is a life beyond death I can see Ed there now looking down and basking in the love and critical acclaim, from both the public and critics, that he's getting now in death that eluded him all those years in Hollywood where he slaved and grabbed to get his movies made and distributed while he was still alive.

First, we are to believe that NASA now seeks out married couples to fly in space - ain't gonna happen in real life. Then, when a rescue mission is called for on Mars the decision to launch one is not made by NASA (as real life might have it) its made by the star-studded cast.As the stupidity rolls on in this film you can find some parts that are just plain horrible writing. For example, the crew flies this amazing hi-tech spaceship to Mars, but just before landing they have a fuel leak. Somehow, someone forgot to put a fuel pressure gage in the ship?!?!? Then we get treated to some of the WORST acting you will ever see. Up to this point in the film we are supposed to believe that Tim Robbins and Connie Neilsen - married in the plot - are deeply in love. But when Robbins 'heroically' dies trying to save the ship, within 10 minutes Connies seems to be 'over it'. We see no further effects that she has lost a husband - and in fact, boy did she recover quickly.You, as the viewer, are then treated to more insults to your intelligence when the crew finds Don Cheadle there on Mars where he has been stranded for many months. Oddly though, Cheadle has no problem breathing on Mars - hmmm, must have brought his own atmosphere - and shock of shocks, he has plenty of electricity to run his fancy computer (which answers all the technical questions) even though he has been there long after batteries would have run out.Now that DePalma has you completely in his power (if you're stupid enough to keep watching) he then lays the biggie on you. Where did Earth's population come from? Mars. Yup, years ago they seeded our planet before leaving their own decaying world. This might be a nice premise for a movie, but here of course, its just the vehicle to explain what to that point has been the mystery in a tedious and boring movie.But the ultimate insult awaits for us in DePalma's utterly ridiculous end of the movie.

His past life is told in black and white flashbacks throughout the movie so we get to see the type of person he was before he went into prison. What is ironic about the film is Derek got his brother interested in the neo-Nazi cause and it is up to him now to show his brother there is more to life then mindless hatred.There is a lot of complaints about the acting and the subject matter but I think those people ain't seeing what the film is trying to say.It is a very dark film that doesn't flinch away from the subject matter, the violence is hard to watch at times especially when Derek is raped by his fellow skinheads. What is disturbing most about the film is Derek and Danny are very clever but their minds are getting twisted by hatred that has no direction.I think the acting is not bad. Edward Norton is just mesmerising in the dual roles he has to play in this film. The first being a skinhead, you can see the madness from within him being translated to his eyes. Then as the changed man, his devastation when he see's his dead brother, has me in tears every time. Edward Furlong isn't bad either, although at times, he does come across as wooden. Stacy Keach plays a charismatic leader of the skinheads who twists their minds, even though he doesn't belief half the things he says to them and keeps his own agenda hidden from them so he can keep his control over them. He is also seen as a coward who is quite happy to incite all this hatred but not to take part in it. Avery Brooks who played Captain Sisko in Star Trek Deep Space Nine, plays a professor who sees past the brothers idiotic hatred and wants to turn their focus to something positive.If I have one negative thing to say, it is that I would have liked the film to show what happened to Edward Norton's character after his brother died, whether he went back to his old ways or continued on the more positive path and try to turn the skinheads away from the violence and hatred they embraced.This film just had me from start to finish.

What is ironic about the film is Derek got his brother interested in the neo-Nazi cause and it is up to him now to show his brother there is more to life then mindless hatred.There is a lot of complaints about the acting and the subject matter but I think those people ain't seeing what the film is trying to say.It is a very dark film that doesn't flinch away from the subject matter, the violence is hard to watch at times especially when Derek is raped by his fellow skinheads. What is disturbing most about the film is Derek and Danny are very clever but their minds are getting twisted by hatred that has no direction.I think the acting is not bad. Edward Norton is just mesmerising in the dual roles he has to play in this film. The first being a skinhead, you can see the madness from within him being translated to his eyes. Then as the changed man, his devastation when he see's his dead brother, has me in tears every time. Edward Furlong isn't bad either, although at times, he does come across as wooden. Stacy Keach plays a charismatic leader of the skinheads who twists their minds, even though he doesn't belief half the things he says to them and keeps his own agenda hidden from them so he can keep his control over them. He is also seen as a coward who is quite happy to incite all this hatred but not to take part in it. Avery Brooks who played Captain Sisko in Star Trek Deep Space Nine, plays a professor who sees past the brothers idiotic hatred and wants to turn their focus to something positive.If I have one negative thing to say, it is that I would have liked the film to show what happened to Edward Norton's character after his brother died, whether he went back to his old ways or continued on the more positive path and try to turn the skinheads away from the violence and hatred they embraced.This film just had me from start to finish.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"17 June 2007","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" (written November 2006)This is an old 80s suspense\/thriller film about detective Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke), who has been hired by the mysterious Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to find one Johnny Favorite, once a singer, who owes Cyphre something big from before the war. Harry goes on a long, twisted journey of murder and violence through Louisiana's rougher parts that eventually leads to a startling conclusion.For the life of me, I could not think of much to say about this movie. It's amazing, that's for sure. Great acting, great setting, mind-blowing plot, attractive young women, big names, it's got all of it. There isn't much to say here except that the movie rules. The plot twist is truly genius once you let it sink in.The detractor of this movie is the fact that the ending sucked. It wasn't a good place to stop the movie really. It's a bit hard to swallow at first, you don't know what hit you. And sadly, it doesn't completely make sense, even after you understand it. There are...plot holes, which I won't state here due to not wanting to ruin this movie. And that is really all I can think of to take points off of this masterpiece. Go rent it. Or buy it. Steal it, even. Whatever. Highly recommended to fans of dark and intelligent films.

Costner is one of my favorite leading men and I respect Robin Wright Penn's work tremendously. But this! Kevin Costner plays a captain who will not let go of his wife's memory while at the same time is falling for Penn, a writer\/researcher's who finds the message in a bottle he wrote to his wife. Mhh, she seems nice, and she is alive, while the other one is dead. What should I do ?And it goes on like this for 131 minutes! The beginning shows this big feud between the captain and his dead wife's family. They want her paintings and he won't part with them. I wanted to say to him keep one and give the others away! When he finally does part with all of them (big sigh of relief there), I thought this drawn out plot was over, closure was made and we would see Penn's character with a new man and a smile on her face, but no!!! He builds a new boat, names it after his late WIFE, invites Penn to the christening, and babbles in public about how much he misses his first love. AHHHH!!The best part for me was definitely the first 9 minutes, which I happened to have missed.And the end is not brave in my opinion, it is contrived and perfectly ludicrous. You don't have to be a psychologist to know Costner's character hasn't moved an inch from the beginning, he says he is saved when he first met his wife, feels guilty because he can't save her back, and then, he has to go and try to save a drowning woman, to make up for the one he couldn't save.It makes me want to scream! So men, women, and children alike do not see this movie, no matter how free it is or how bored you are. Or even how handsome Costner is. I learned my lesson.Better see Dragonfly. There's a missing wife there too but that film will take your breath away.
