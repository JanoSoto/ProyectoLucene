[{"date":"2 May 1999","score":"","review":"  Seeing the excellent film, Elizabeth, answered one question I had but left me with another. Elizabeth shows that a reasonably accurate historical dramatic film can be interesting and even exciting. This story in a way is a feminine contrast to Braveheart. Instead of blood and guts and nonsensical romantic situations, Elizabeth is always intelligent, subtle and clearly shows without distorting history that as a leader Queen Elizabeth was at least as capable as any man. I very much liked the director Shekhar Kapur's stylish use of having the camera look through gauze and scarves; an excellent metaphor (about people never being seen clearly for what they are) for the deception and conspiracy that surrounded the young Elizabeth. The sets, costumes and supporting cast are also top notch.My unanswered question is how could Cate Blanchette not have won the Academy Award for this role? This mystery about the Academy goes back a long time. For instance, have you ever seen a movie starring the actress Judy Holiday? I doubt it. Yet Ms. Holiday won the Academy Award in 1950 the same year as these two fantastic performances, Gloria Swanson (Sunset Boulevard) and Bette Davis (All About Eve). Incredible. Now, I have already praised Gwyneth Paltrow in Shakespeare in Love. Paltrow is developing her craft and may be a great actress someday but Blanchette is already there. Her acting in Elizabeth ranks with any female performance of an historical character on film.Simply, Blanchette makes a good movie a great one.

It was the closest thing to the Emperor's new clothes syndrome that I've experienced in a long, long, time. Talk about publicity and a few good reviews snowing the public!  I found this film neither well written nor very witty or well performed by its leads.  It simply isn't very entertaining.  If this is supposedly one of the best films of the year, then the movies are in deep trouble. After seeing this movie I was particularly stunned that Gwyneth Paltrow had won the Oscar for best actress.  Didn't anyone see Fernanda Montenegro in the superb Central Station?  Paltrow's Shakespearean performance as Juliet was laughable, about on a par with a sophomore college production and to try to see her as Shakespeare's muse was the only real laugh I got in the entire two hours.  In addition, Joseph Finnes played the bard like the lead in a television sitcom and I kept waiting for the laugh track to help him achieve his comic effects. I think what really, finally, annoyed me about this so called comedy was how self satisfied, pseudo-intellectual and manipulative it was (very like many of Tom Stoppard's plays, come to think of it).  That is, it was if the filmmakers clearly aimed their picture at an upper middle class, middle brow audience who would get the obvious Shakespearean references, feel good about that Shakespeare 101 class they once attended, and then get swept away by the tepid, light weight, undemanding romance.  Great film comedies have a broader appeal than this and the greatest, like Shakespeare's plays, attract and amuse all sorts of audiences.  In addition, again unlike any of Shakespeare's plays, there wasn't one original idea in the piece or one honest emotion.  The one joke, repeated over and over, was the long life of various theatrical cliche's.  If that's the best wit Hollywood can come up with, I'll stick to Peanuts. Shakespeare's plays are so much better then this film that I, for one, felt insulted for his memory.

Since that day it has been my favourite film of all time. This is a film that divides people in 2 categories; they either love or hate it. You certainly need to have a good sense of humour in order to like this film. It has certain images in it that might shock a sensitive person if not watched with an open mind. So to all you serious people out there you have been warned!Everyone must know what the story is all about by now. But just for the repetition; Trainspotting tells a story about Scottish Mark Renton and his friends. Together they form a group of junkies who are addicted to any drug there is. It's a sad story about life's losers and their difficulties to choose life. But this is not the thing that makes it so great. The best thing about it is it's continuous sarcasm and the fact that this is a film you really can't watch without feeling nausea and amusement at the same time. It makes fun of the serious things that people usually don't talk about and that's definitely one of it's best sides. The atmosphere of the film has been created very commonplace so it's quite easy to identify with the characters. The hilarious dialogues alone make this film worth seeing. Added to all this there's really great music that makes Trainspotting a cult movie for good! The book's not nearly as good as the film.ATTENTION all you Trainspotting fans out there! Does anyone know where the title Trainspotting comes from? It certainly hasn't got anything to do with spotting trains! I'd truly appreciate it if someone bothered to answer me somehow!
