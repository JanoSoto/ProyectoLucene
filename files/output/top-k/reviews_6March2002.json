I had my doubts when I heard about this film, but when I saw it my doubts were no more. All the actors were pretty good, with some out-shining others. Mark Dacascos did very well. His acting has improved since Only the strong. One of the reviewers mentioned that the guy who plays Fronsac (LeBihan) was another version of Christopher Lambert. I disagree. LeBihan has more range than Lambert, who tends to be kind of wooden. I will say that the wolf was kind of a disappointment. I was expecting something like An American Wolf in London. Maybe I got my hopes a little to high. In addition, another reviewer commented that the movie got its facts wrong about the French fighting against the Native Americans, in the French and Indian War. Well, that's not true. Now most of the Indian tribes did side with the French, but some did side with the English. Also, some reviewers complained about the noble savage concept throughout the movie. Now this is the 18th century, it's not like the French or almost any white person during that time was going to be hand-shaken with Mani. Society forced Mani to play second tier to Fronsac; not Fronsac or the director. Although I loved Mani, I also loved Sylvia. Even though she was a prostitute, she still had a certain strength and way about her that made you want to fear her and respect her. In addition, Jean-Francois de Marangias was a villain and a tragic character at the same time. Is it me or did anyone start to think of Gladiator, when he started to confess his love\/obsession for his sister? The fight sequences were good, but comparing them to Crouching Tiger is a little much. Like another viewer I did notice that during the fight scenes the bad guys tended to attack one at a time. However, it wasn't as bad as some Van Damme and Norris movies. There were times when they did attack two or three at a time. Some people complained that there were too many people who knew martial arts in the movie; that it was 18th century France not 18th century China. Look! The movie is part fantasy, so lets not be picky. Besides it was understandable that Fronsac and Mani weren't the only ones to know martial arts, Jean-Francois knew it. Since he was a hunter\/traveler he could of learned it during one of his travels. Also, that could be the explanation for why Fronsac and Mani knew martial arts too. I will say that the Gypsies knowing martial arts was a little far-fetched. The movie was damn good. The best movie I've seen in a while. In fact, to a certain degree it's better than Lord of the Rings. This is the movie I should of went to see two weeks ago instead of the dismal Queen of the Damned. What has happened to Hollywood in the past 3 or 4 years? The movies they're producing lately are for crap. Many people in the U.S. are starting to look overseas to get good entertainment.

Having seen it a further three times at the cinema, I still find fault with it, but I keep returning to it, thinking about it, discussing it, and it has left me with a feeling that, five months later, I've still not shaked.  In many regards, this movie reminds me of Fight Club, not in terms of theme or emotional content, but due to it's level of craft, the daring nature of it's execution and the fact that I keep re-evaluating it.  All the things that are possible to comment objectively on (if anything ever is) are handled expertly.  The performances are top-notch, especially Haley Joel Osment as David, the little robot child that longs to be human.  The effects are not only very impressive, but are integrated into the story rather than calling attention to themselves.  Januz Kaminski's photography is, as one has come to expect, impressive, and the movie is unusually unpredictable for such a big-budget experience. In my opinion, John Williams' score is among his most impressive.  I listened to it on CD for three weeks before seeing the movie, and thought it was fantastic, but once the movie started rolling I completely forgot about the music.  That says a lot about both the score and the film itself.  I also liked the three-act structure, in which the tone and feel of the movie changes drastically as the story progresses.  Part one, as one reviewer noted, feels like a cross between E.T. and The Shining, an odd, but very effective combination.  The second part of the movie is awash with Spielbergian imagery, but with the darkness and coldness of a Kubrick movie. And the last part is a head-scratcher that has the intellectual resonance of most Kubrick-films, and the emotional tone of something like Cinema Paradiso.  I purposely refrain from saying that it is as emotional as Spielberg-films, because I think the director's complexities, the dark aspects of his style, and the occasional subtleties of his work are often overlooked by critics. It's difficult to discuss the themes of the movie without spoiling it, but while many people criticised the movie from having several false endings, I felt that each continuation added layers of though and complexities that the movie would have lacked had it ended sooner.  I have come to the conclusion, over the past months, that I do love the movie and that it is my favourite film of 2001, even ahead of The Fellowship of The Ring and Amelie.

In many regards, this movie reminds me of Fight Club, not in terms of theme or emotional content, but due to it's level of craft, the daring nature of it's execution and the fact that I keep re-evaluating it.  All the things that are possible to comment objectively on (if anything ever is) are handled expertly.  The performances are top-notch, especially Haley Joel Osment as David, the little robot child that longs to be human.  The effects are not only very impressive, but are integrated into the story rather than calling attention to themselves.  Januz Kaminski's photography is, as one has come to expect, impressive, and the movie is unusually unpredictable for such a big-budget experience. In my opinion, John Williams' score is among his most impressive.  I listened to it on CD for three weeks before seeing the movie, and thought it was fantastic, but once the movie started rolling I completely forgot about the music.  That says a lot about both the score and the film itself.  I also liked the three-act structure, in which the tone and feel of the movie changes drastically as the story progresses.  Part one, as one reviewer noted, feels like a cross between E.T. and The Shining, an odd, but very effective combination.  The second part of the movie is awash with Spielbergian imagery, but with the darkness and coldness of a Kubrick movie. And the last part is a head-scratcher that has the intellectual resonance of most Kubrick-films, and the emotional tone of something like Cinema Paradiso.  I purposely refrain from saying that it is as emotional as Spielberg-films, because I think the director's complexities, the dark aspects of his style, and the occasional subtleties of his work are often overlooked by critics. It's difficult to discuss the themes of the movie without spoiling it, but while many people criticised the movie from having several false endings, I felt that each continuation added layers of though and complexities that the movie would have lacked had it ended sooner.  I have come to the conclusion, over the past months, that I do love the movie and that it is my favourite film of 2001, even ahead of The Fellowship of The Ring and Amelie.  In other words, buy it on DVD, it's more than worth it.

I had forgotten just how beautifully done it was - both a character study of two very different men and a gripping plot of their attempts to succeed - partly through athletics. the writer and director so well convey both Cambridge and the Edinburgh Presbyterian missionary disciples, in the early 1920s so very well.The acting is superb - I had never seen a character presented like Eric Liddell in movies - how fine Ian Charleson was in this role, the softness of his voice, his ease and joy in running competitively (especially in contrast with the tense tortured Harold Abrahams). I also loved the more supporting roles - I've read a biography of F.E. Smith and Nigel Davenport is exactly how I would imagine him. The actor who played the Prince of Wales also seemed exactly right with his effortless charm, looks, and lack of imagination. Ian Holm, John Gielgud, Lindsay Anderson - all wonderful.The actors weren't chosen for glamour either - Liddell and Abrahams are not Leni Riefenstahl images of athletic ideals, Liddell's sister is no beauty - and Abrahams' girlfriend is pretty but not stunning. It made them seem more real. (In nice contrast were the near-pretty boy looks of Nigel Havers as Lord Lindsay - it so suited his character).The races are riveting - partly due to the music and sound effects.So many small things are done so well - e.g., when Lord Lindsay has the confidence of his class to barge into a room containing the Prince of Wales, and three other lords (including Birkenhead and the head of the British Olympic Committee) and greets them by name - no need for introduction there (as there was for Liddell). It's small but seems quite real.As an American, it was interesting and funny to see our Olympic team shown as the numerous, ominous, invulnerable other! (something like watching a Rocky movie with Rocky as the product of a Russian or East German success machine!). In fact, the one scene that seemed a bit off was the scene of the American track athletes warming up for the Games - all heavy music, machine like athletes, ferocious coach yelling with a megaphone into people's ears. It pounded too hard on the these are the scary almighty inhuman opponents theme in contrast to the cheerful British boys running along the beach.Something I had forgotten about the movie was how stubborn BOTH protagonists are - Liddell fully as much as Abrahams. Liddell is not overly deferential or bashful when dealing with the Prince of Wales - but instead straightforward and very firm. I truly can't understand anyone not liking this movie - it is very exciting even on the basic level of will they win? and so much more. (For example, Ian Holm's character's reaction to success after 30 years is very moving). Those who write to say that Reds deserved the Oscar more - are simply wrong. (Reds was so simplistic that it felt like watching the movie The Hardy Boys Go to the Russian Revolution).

D.C. in the 60's and was just a bit too old for the hippy movement, but many of my friends actually went to Woodstock!The cast is wonderful and the film is made with care and affection for all these people.The story is one of discovery and growth on the part of all the players.  A young wife who had her first child when she was still a teen-ager, now feels trapped by her domestic life.  Her daughter is just becoming a woman. Her husband is a workaholic who slaves to provide for his family and has little time for enjoyment himself.  The son worships his father.  The father's mother, the Bubby knows why he did not go to college but keeps that and other things to herself, until the proper time. Then the wife meets the free-spirited Blouse Man and, for a few days she samples what it's like to be free.The consequences of her action affect the entire community and life lessons are learned.I highly recommend this film.  It is quite erotic in places, but that fits so well with the story line that I do not find it offensive. The nicest thing about this film is that you like everyone, and at the end, the Bubby, husband, son and daughter all come to understand the attraction of The Blouse Man.

I see my Aunts and Uncles and my Bubby and myself as I must have been as a teen.  The only difference is location...they went to Lake Geneva, Wisc. from Chicago.The time in which this film takes place is also familiar.  I was living in Wash. D.C. in the 60's and was just a bit too old for the hippy movement, but many of my friends actually went to Woodstock!The cast is wonderful and the film is made with care and affection for all these people.The story is one of discovery and growth on the part of all the players.  A young wife who had her first child when she was still a teen-ager, now feels trapped by her domestic life.  Her daughter is just becoming a woman.
