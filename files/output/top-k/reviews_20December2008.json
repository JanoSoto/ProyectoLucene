I had a great deal of expectations when I watched this movie. Many friends said it is superb and I like all the other Kubrick movies I watched so far. But yeah. First of all the complete movie is filmed with a very keen eye on details. The ape costumes for example are great and the space vessels seem very realistic. The effects are much ahead of its time and are still remarkable today. But there is much missing. After the initial ape scene, which has some great shots the really boring part begins. Wee see spaceships with Strauss' Danube waltz in the background. It is pretty, for about 5 minutes, but after it is just boring. The music keeps repeating and all is very very slow. Some of the former critics say that you have to appreciate the beauty in it. Well spacecrafts aren't exactly beautiful and the statement, you have to enjoy this movie as a picture is stupid, because it is a movie after all. Maybe Kubrick chose the wrong medium for his 'art'. Later on even the music itself stops and it gets worse and worse. Some critics said the ships must be slow for being realistic. That is stupid, because in space velocity is relative and it wouldn't be less realistic if the ship was faster or slower. Over all there isn't much of a plot, which doesn't need to be a bad thing if the rest is entertaining. But it isn't entertaining, therefore plot is missing. I have to admit, that the end became interesting again. After a psychedelic sequence, where one doesn't know what it means come a few very good scenes. My friend insisted, that one can't really grasp the whole thing without reading the book along. But that is not the characteristic of a great movie. The psychedelic experience could also have been caused by a lack of oxygen leading to a dream sequence. One couldn't know the difference. I believe, if you'd take only the first ape sequence and the last aging and rebirth sequence you would really get a fascinating movie. What I most hate about the movie are the people watching it and telling me it is one of the best movies of all time. These are the same kind of people that visit an art gallery for the sake of telling other people that they are interested in art. Even my friend, who praised the movie, suddenly admitted that the movie is in fact boring for the most part. Art is not good because it bores you. It is the same mentality as saying, that culture has to be boring and that boring things are culture. And yes, I am not the kind of person who loves action movies. If it would be an intelligent movie, it wouldn't be boring, because really intelligent movies aren't boring. People brag about the philosophical meanings of this movie. What is the meaning of a flying spacecraft? Why has to be a philosophical meaning in a fictional short story containing aliens teaching mankind? There simply isn't one. Most people say that this movie is awesome because their friends do and this makes me angry. To sum it up Boring as a whole but has some interesting genius scenes. It is not a bad movie, but also definitely not great and it is certainly not mediocre.

First the bad things on this movie, this movie is so low budget that the whole documentary-like style of the camera had to obligatory cause they couldn't afford any camera men(though that style did change the world of movie making). Next, the plot, wow lost in the woods how original, that was seen in Friday the 13th so the whole lost in the woods things isn't so original, now the reason why they are lost in the woods was original but worst part of this film is the fact that it builds suspense for nothing(like the scene when they ran out of the tent, screaming and scared, suspenseful but not scary cause you don't even know what they running from.)For all I care it could be Bigfoot attacking them. Now the main thing people say about why this movie was so great was because they claim that the movie activates their imagination, and I think that means that this movie leaves out so many unanswered questions that to them it's fun to fill in the blanks, of course not like the movie disappearance in which they leave out so many blanks it makes the movie awful, well that wasn't the case with the Blair witch project, but still even if it is fun to fill in the blanks with this film that is no excuse for the people who don't like to fill in the blanks, so to me it sounds like people like this movie because it basically wastes their time. And now we come to the center question of this film which is Why did they not show the witch?! Now if they had shown the witch, I would just recommend you rent this movie but no, this movie is like a nightmare on elm street without Freddy Krueger, you wait around for something to happen, and when they finally come the ending the idiot chick drops the camera which honestly is a disappointment, you expect something creepy and all that, when nothing really happens at all, and really if a 6 year old doesn't get scared watching this film how can an entire nation get scared over some movie which is nothing more than a publicity stunt to gain quick cash. Alright, now though the whole movie was a waste of time there is the upside of the fact that this movie did have an original storyline and did have the potential to be a horror classic, but of course it was not a true horror classic, now this movie is like the Hulk which was a good idea pretty much screwed up so this film needs a remake seriously and it needs it right now.

Say that you've robbed a whack of banks...gathered up around $500 000 in todays currency and fled the country to another country where your money will make you uber wealthy...Why even bother to continue to rob and steal?

But, unfortunately, what most horror films lack is characters. They don't usually have a big enough heart, and their characters are all expendable. Whether or not this film fits into the category of horror is debatable, but this story is horrific, and dramatic. It tells us about characters we care about, and puts them through hell. It's as much a drama as a horror film, and the mixture of both is impeccable.Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is trying to woo magazine reporter Veronica Ronnie Quaife (Geena Davis). Brundle has an experiment that he's been working on, so he shows it to her. It's a teleportation device, but it has a few problems, like it's inability to transport living things, and keep them alive. After finally getting it to work, Brundle accidentally, and unknowingly mixes his D.N.A. with a fly's, and soon starts transforming into a monster.The characters are what this picture is all about. Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis have great chemistry together, and they play off each other well. This film starts off with Goldblum and Davis meeting each other, and the first half of the film is dedicated to showing us these characters. This is quite effective so the we care about what happens during the last half of the movie. The other main character is Stathis Borans (John Getz), and he's the most miraculous character of them all. He's set up as a chauvinist villain, but this movie doesn't give into stereotype that easy. This character, who has some horrible and rude qualities, has a heart and shows that just because a character has bad qualities doesn't mean they have to be the villain.The direction and writing is good. The scenes looked well thought out, and they could be pretty disturbing. The makeup effects, which won the 1986 Academy Award are very cool. The transformation scenes rival those in 1981's An American Werewolf in London for best disgusting makeup effects of 1980s cinema.Howard Shore's musical score for this film is amazing. It's grand and bigger than it should be, like the music from the '50s, but it sounds great. It's a perfect mix of a loud brass section and a soft theme on the flute.This story about a man's transformation into a fly is sad and horrific (with those words being used in the best sense).

He won Oscars, he made studios' smaller pictures look good, and he was a critic's wet dream. But outside of that is only a very small faction that are Woody-ites who can delight in his style. I have never been one of them.Allen's approach of breezy conversation, small chuckles, and statements on life have never really done much to keep me awake. But lo and behold, stop them presses...somehow here he managed to appeal to the casual Woody viewer, and create at least one half of a tolerable movie. Who knew Woody could do Law & Order (with two of its stars in tow)??After much hem-hawing at the keyboard, I've decided to start with the good. That aspect focuses on a 50-something eye doctor who has found himself in an extra-marital situation he can't extract himself from. He can't reason with his paramour, but he also can't confess to his society wife. What options remain? Yep, he's ready to dial M, with the aid of his brother (Orbach, in his usually reliable, understated form). Landau's inner tug-of-war and some pretty good criminal tension permeate the story very nicely.What this is intermingled with doesn't work as well. Woody writes himself yet another waify loser who hasn't had sex in a year with his doornail wife. Who comes to his heartstring's rescue yet again? Yep, Mia Farrow, always depicted as his (and all other men in the cast) be-all, end-all of available women in the mecca of New York. Here, he battles an enjoyable Alan Alda for her affections.Though I admired the obtuse storyline of mixing humor with homicide, that becomes the film's problem. We're so pulled in by Landau's situation, that when Allen cuts away from it, we could care less about the stale romance being played out on the other end. And again, Woody's idea of jokes to the average film goer only net titters and smiles.He does incorporate a few solid touches camera-wise, such as Landau actually interacting with a flashback from his past, and using push-ins only when necessary. And despite his slight side of the story, Woody manages to finish it with a little bit of a surprise as to who Farrow chooses.Even with enjoying his darker side of the film, it was odd to see him borrow from the mainstream, as the Landau\/Huston side of the film is basically a take on Fatal Attraction. Just minus the x-rated sex and bloody finale.So, take whatever you can from this Woody effort, possibly on a Sunday afternoon when nothing else is on. Or who knows, maybe you'll join the legion.

That's the saddest thing I've ever heard, says the pond-ice-skating 13-year-old Marty (Natalie Portman) after she professes her affections for 28-year-old Willie (Timothy Hutton), who proceeds to explain what happens when people outgrow things they no longer need.But it's true. You'll go through changes. And I can't be a Pooh. The best of all high school reunion films, Ted Demme's Beautiful Girls takes us to a small town and keeps us there, managing to accomplish this through stark honesty.In this truly underrated gem, we don't have a protagonist coming home to mom baking cookies and numerous well-to-do siblings talking politics while carrying infants in their bosoms. Here we have Willie (Hutton), a quiet, unassertive piano player who returns to snowy Knight's Ridge, Massachusetts to a lower-middle-class house, a shy, aimless brother (David Arquette) and an uncommunicative widower father (Richard Bright) who after years of his son's absence can only manage to say, There's some golf on the TV. Do you wanna watch some golf? We also meet his childhood buddies, including the handsome Birdie (Matt Dillon), the loser Paul (Michael Rapaport), and family man Mo (Noah Emmerich), all of whom are alcoholics, largely out-of-luck in relationships\/careers, and have never left Knight's Ridge.Willie knows the difference. He misses his identity, but knows exactly why he left his one-horse town. He's been a struggling artist in New York for years. He knows himself and his dreams, and to settle for anything less would be a step backward.

It focuses on two undercover police detectives, Sgt. Deke DaSilva(SYLVESTER STALLONE) and his partner Sgt. Matthew Fox(BILLY DEE WILLIAMS)who work in the NYPD Citywide Street Crime Unit as decoy officers. Donning different disguises, they walk the streets of the City's toughest neighborhoods, offering themselves up as bait for muggers and other lowlifes. This unit was responsible for taking a lot of guns and dangerous people off the streets. Unfortunately, in the wake of the Amadou Diallo shooting in the Bronx in 1999, it was disbanded.The arrival in New York of an international terrorist named Wulfgar(RUTGER HAUER) finds the two Detectives temporarily reassigned to an elite counter-terrorist unit called ATAC. A British expert on counterterrorism in general and Wulfgar in particular(NIGEL DAVENPORT) is recruited by the Department to train the selectees in the different strategies and tactics they'll need to deal with this new threat. His character, Peter Hartman, is an old hand at understanding the terrorist mentality and how they operate. He is also a believer in taking the shot when the opportunity presents itself, even if it results in collateral damage, or death to a civilian hostage.Stallone's character has a big problem with all this. He indicates that he didn't join the Department to kill people, whether they're street criminals, terrorists, or especially, innocent civilians. Clashing with Hartman at every juncture, he says he doesn't want any part of this and indicates to the Englishman that he's quitting the unit. His partner talks him out of it by telling him that Hartman sees him as one of the best and that's why he was chosen. In reviewing DaSilva's wartime kill record in Vietnam, Hartman tells him that he has faith that when the time comes, he'll do what needs to be done.Wulfgar is very intelligent, cunning and good-looking and his MO is to hook up with women he meets at discos and move in with them, using their apartments as a safe house. When he meets Pam(HILARIE THOMPSON), an airline stewardess, she asks him what he does for a living. Knowing that she won't believe him, he tells her the truth- that he's an international terrorist wanted by the police in various European countries. When she stumbles upon his weapons stash in her closet after he moves in with her, she realizes too late that what he told her was not a jocular remark. When the police find her body they also find a clue that he inadvertently left behind indicating what his strike target here in the City will be. DaSilva and Fox start scouring the discotheques with the woman's photo in hand to try and get a line on whom she might have hooked up with. They hit paydirt when DaSilva spots whom he suspects might be Wulfgar at a disco with his newly altered facial appearance, courtesy of plastic surgery in Europe. DaSilva uses the police trick of staring Wulfgar down to see if he gets hinky and Wulfgar realizes he's been made. A chase into the subway ensues, with Wulfgar taking an elderly woman hostage at knifepoint. DaSilva gets him in his sights but doesn't take the shot out of fear of hitting the hostage. In the ensuing chase, Sgt. Fox is ambushed by Wulfgar, who slices his face open and then makes good his escape. DaSilva, whose button has now been pushed, will no longer harbor any illusions about what he's dealing with. Wulfgar's associate in terrorism is one Shakka Holland, played by the beautiful late Indian actress PERSIS KHAMBATTA. She is so effective in her portrayal of a coldhearted woman who kills without compunction or remorse, that your blood will be chilled when you see her on screen. Without even saying anything, she will terrify you. You will not forget the look on her face. It will definitely haunt your dreams.We all know that the movie is leading up to a climactic confrontation between DaSilva and Wulfgar. And we know when that moment of truth arrives that DaSilva, now effectively disabused of his I'm not here to kill anyone philosophy, will indeed do what needs to be done. I won't reveal the ending here, other than to say that it reflects well on his training and experience in the Street Crime Unit. This is a well-crafted thriller with excellent performances, beautiful photography, and a storyline that will resonate with the viewer on a visceral level. It will keep you hooked from the opening sequence until the end. Yo Adrian- this is my favorite Stallone film. I give it a 10 out of 10.

It focuses on two undercover police detectives, Sgt. Deke DaSilva(SYLVESTER STALLONE) and his partner Sgt. Matthew Fox(BILLY DEE WILLIAMS)who work in the NYPD Citywide Street Crime Unit as decoy officers. Donning different disguises, they walk the streets of the City's toughest neighborhoods, offering themselves up as bait for muggers and other lowlifes. This unit was responsible for taking a lot of guns and dangerous people off the streets. Unfortunately, in the wake of the Amadou Diallo shooting in the Bronx in 1999, it was disbanded.The arrival in New York of an international terrorist named Wulfgar(RUTGER HAUER) finds the two Detectives temporarily reassigned to an elite counter-terrorist unit called ATAC. A British expert on counterterrorism in general and Wulfgar in particular(NIGEL DAVENPORT) is recruited by the Department to train the selectees in the different strategies and tactics they'll need to deal with this new threat. His character, Peter Hartman, is an old hand at understanding the terrorist mentality and how they operate. He is also a believer in taking the shot when the opportunity presents itself, even if it results in collateral damage, or death to a civilian hostage.Stallone's character has a big problem with all this. He indicates that he didn't join the Department to kill people, whether they're street criminals, terrorists, or especially, innocent civilians. Clashing with Hartman at every juncture, he says he doesn't want any part of this and indicates to the Englishman that he's quitting the unit. His partner talks him out of it by telling him that Hartman sees him as one of the best and that's why he was chosen. In reviewing DaSilva's wartime kill record in Vietnam, Hartman tells him that he has faith that when the time comes, he'll do what needs to be done.Wulfgar is very intelligent, cunning and good-looking and his MO is to hook up with women he meets at discos and move in with them, using their apartments as a safe house. When he meets Pam(HILARIE THOMPSON), an airline stewardess, she asks him what he does for a living. Knowing that she won't believe him, he tells her the truth- that he's an international terrorist wanted by the police in various European countries. When she stumbles upon his weapons stash in her closet after he moves in with her, she realizes too late that what he told her was not a jocular remark. When the police find her body they also find a clue that he inadvertently left behind indicating what his strike target here in the City will be. DaSilva and Fox start scouring the discotheques with the woman's photo in hand to try and get a line on whom she might have hooked up with. They hit paydirt when DaSilva spots whom he suspects might be Wulfgar at a disco with his newly altered facial appearance, courtesy of plastic surgery in Europe. DaSilva uses the police trick of staring Wulfgar down to see if he gets hinky and Wulfgar realizes he's been made. A chase into the subway ensues, with Wulfgar taking an elderly woman hostage at knifepoint. DaSilva gets him in his sights but doesn't take the shot out of fear of hitting the hostage. In the ensuing chase, Sgt. Fox is ambushed by Wulfgar, who slices his face open and then makes good his escape. DaSilva, whose button has now been pushed, will no longer harbor any illusions about what he's dealing with. Wulfgar's associate in terrorism is one Shakka Holland, played by the beautiful late Indian actress PERSIS KHAMBATTA. She is so effective in her portrayal of a coldhearted woman who kills without compunction or remorse, that your blood will be chilled when you see her on screen. Without even saying anything, she will terrify you. You will not forget the look on her face. It will definitely haunt your dreams.We all know that the movie is leading up to a climactic confrontation between DaSilva and Wulfgar. And we know when that moment of truth arrives that DaSilva, now effectively disabused of his I'm not here to kill anyone philosophy, will indeed do what needs to be done. I won't reveal the ending here, other than to say that it reflects well on his training and experience in the Street Crime Unit. This is a well-crafted thriller with excellent performances, beautiful photography, and a storyline that will resonate with the viewer on a visceral level. It will keep you hooked from the opening sequence until the end. Yo Adrian- this is my favorite Stallone film. I give it a 10 out of 10.

A footchase through Venice Beach neighborhoods defies endurance and fatigue, while a leap from a plane sans a parachute defies logic.But logic doesn't matter when adrenaline is pumping through your system. And that's precisely the point of Kathryn Bigelow's Point Break, a movie that's just as exciting the 20th time you see it as the first.Some people might ridicule the fact that this film is so high on my list. Conceptually a B movie (FBI rookie infiltrates gang of surfer bank robbers), the film did moderately well at the box office and could easily have been dismissed as an action-thriller among the likes of Lethal Weapon or Die Hard. But I have a hard time finding a movie that matches this film's serenity and luster, which ultimately defines the spell under which special agent Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) falls after meeting surfer Bodhi (Patrick Swayze).They say there's something about surfing unlike anything in the world. And there's a reason why people get up at 5am each day to hit the waves before the tourists show up. There's something magical about the ocean's power, something transcendent about reaching a harmony with its rhythms, which Bodhi describes as a spiritual side of it (that nazi surf punks like Anthony Kiedis fail to understand). Go watch Endless Summer and see men in their 50s abandoning careers and material possessions traveling the world in search of the perfect wave. This is what Utah is seduced by, a blend of adrenaline and total clarity that Bodhi embodies and by which he leads his minions into the rush of armed robbery. At several moments in the film, we too can imagine ourselves picking up a surfboard or jumping out of a plane, even if normally we'd consider ourselves too cowardly to do so.Point Break features relentless stunt sequences arguably unmatched since its 1991 release-- and best of all, it mounts them one after another until its jaw-dropping climax. The raid on the meth house with a sequence involving a knife and lawnmower, the (already-mentioned) chase through Venice Beach including narrow alleyways and literally breaking through private residences, and a leap with no parachute out of a cessna over the Ensenada desert-- they're just highlights. Those don't even include the surf sequences, beginning at Leo Carrillo with Utah first learning how to pop up, on to the haunting final scene with Bodhi vanishing into a 70-footer on Bells Beach, Australia. Director Bigelow, who began her career as a painter, clearly places a high emphasis on visual appeal, rarely leaving a shot without some majesty to it. Meanwhile, in the context of California beach culture, Reeves and Swayze (and even Lori Petty) are perfectly cast, while Gary Busey has some of the best moments of his career as Utah's older, energetic partner Angelo Pappas.Universal Pictures essentially remade this movie for the post-millennium audience as The Fast and the Furious, with Paul Walker in the Utah role and Vin Diesel in the Bodhi role. And that film was precisely what I mentioned earlier Point Break could've been-- an adequately entertaining action thriller among the likes of Lethal Weapon and Die Hard. But street racing, while exciting, lacks the spellbinding serenity of surfing. Driving at speeds of 120mph can get you a rush, but there's no feeling of the earth, no spiritual harmony, no lucidity in one's existence.I was thirteen when this film was first released, in a summer when Terminator 2 was all the rage among teenage boys. It wasn't until the next spring that I rented the movie on video, at which time my older cousin told me I can't believe you didn't see this in the theater! With the help of a big screen TV and surround sound, I began to understand what he meant. In many ways, this is a movie to be experienced like the very first action-thrillers, where audiences leapt into aisles to avoid being hit by trains charging at the screen. Point Break doesn't try to be profound or dramatic or anything else it's not. But it's far better than Terminator 2 Die Hard or Lethal Weapon or any other cops-robbers movie that has been released in the last twenty years. Not until Zack Snyder's 300 (2006) was a non-Oscar-aspiring action film able to jolt adrenaline in viewers at a purely visceral level from its frenetic sensory experience.Point Break is just that good.

Likewise, 'Get Carter (1971),' from director Mike Hodges, is an incredibly gritty underworld gangster film, so much so that you can almost taste the gravel between your teeth. It won't escape your notice that all three of these films are British, or, at least, were produced with substantial British input; apparently, it took Hollywood a few more years to become quite as well accustomed to such themes, although that year's Best Picture-winner, 'The French Connection (1971),' does rival 'Get Carter' as far as grittiness goes.Jack Carter (Michael Caine) is a London gangster, an entirely unglamorous occupation that entails such duties as gambling, murder and watching pornography. After his brother, Frank, dies in Newcastle under suspicious circumstances, Jack goes up there, against the wishes of his employer, to find out exactly what happened, and to punish all those responsible. What he finds is the usual assortment of sleazy low-lifes and lascivious whores, all part of the underground lifestyle into which he sold himself. 'Get Carter' obviously derived a degree of influence from the trashy pulp-fiction novels of Raymond Chandler and Mickey Spillane, and, indeed, this inspiration is openly acknowledged when Carter is seen reading Farewell My Lovely adapted by Edward Dmytryk as 'Murder, My Sweet (1944)'. Like many of the hard-boiled anti-heroes of 1940s and 50s film noir, he has sold his soul for a chance at revenge, and there's no going back. A detail worth noting (and I couldn't have noticed this by myself) is that Carter's eventual assassin is first spotted during the opening credits, sitting opposite in the train carriage. A cruel coincidence, or was his fate sealed from the very beginning?'Get Carter' may have served as inspiration to the recent generation of British gangster film, but the Quentin Tarantino\/Guy Ritchie style of film-making favoured today &#150; the most notable example of which being 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)' &#150; is often excessively trendy and highly stylised. Mike Hodges' idea of a gangster film is ugly &#150; disgustingly and uncomfortably repellent, offering not a glimmer of respectability nor nobility in its selection of depraved characters. Even Jack Carter himself is not a man we are asked to admire. He may have a steady supply of droll one-liners at hand, but at his heart he is cold, almost completely devoid of human emotion. Just watch Carter's stone-face as his car is rammed into the bay (with an unfortunate captive in the boot), or his indifference to the fate of friend Keith (Alun Armstrong), who is thoroughly roughed-up while lending a hand. Hodges appears only to find decency in the deceased Frank, who represents the honest, working-class type of man. However, even this legacy is coming to an end, for the next generation, Doreen, has already been corrupted.

He is a defeated man who has failed miserably because of his hard drinking, among other things. But his luck is about to change. After being sent to report on a rattle snake contest, he stumbles on a tragic situation where a miner has been trapped in an abandoned silver mine. Tatum recognizes the value of the situation as a news item that will, not only sell papers, but will, perhaps, give him the chance to make it big in the field he knows well. He risks his own life in going into the mine to interview Leo Minosa.In order to do that, he joins forces with the corrupt local sheriff Kretzer, who is game for what the deal will mean to his status in the community. In exchange for his efforts, he wants to be the exclusive rights to the situation. Tatum meets the miner's wife, a one time saloon girl, Lorraine, who Leo rescued from an uncertain life and brought her to the family's restaurant in the dusty desert area. Lorraine sees an opportunity to flee the scene, something that she has done before, but Chuck Tatum wants her as part of the scheme he has plotted in his mind.When the human story hits the airwaves, it finds a captive audience. Soon, all curiosity seekers descend on the area next to the mine to witness whatever happens. Instead of using conventional methods, Chuck decides to milk the situation by not doing what reason dictates must be done. He decides to direct the drilling from the top, a process that will delay the rescue operation, but will give Tatum a chance to gain the notoriety he seeks, at the expense of the man pinned down in the mine.This film, directed by the great Billy Wilder, is one of his finest efforts in Hollywood. Yet, the film didn't find an audience, unlike the one attracted within the film. Written in collaboration by Mr. Wilder, Lesser Samuels and Walter Newman, the screenplay is one of the most ambitious in the director's distinguished career. He knew exactly where he wanted to know, using as a theme the manipulation of the news by people that only want to show sensationalism, at the expense of a human suffering. Kirk Douglas had one of his finest moments in the movies with his Chuck Tatum. He knew exactly what the public wanted and he gives it to them. In a way, he was a great impresario, setting the scene for the curious to come to the show to be on the front row to witness the suffering and pain Leo Minosa was experiencing. Jan Sterling, who plays Lorraine, matches Mr. Douglas all the way. She could see inside the man who didn't care about a husband that she was going to abandon, anyway. The rest of the cast does a fine job.Charles Lang's cinematography captures in vivid detail the carnival atmosphere that is at the center of the film. His camera angles enhance the film tremendously. Hugo Friedhofer provided the musical score that blended perfectly with the action. Arthur Schmidt editing works well. Ultimately this was a Billy Wilder film that will stay in the viewer's memory for quite a long time.
