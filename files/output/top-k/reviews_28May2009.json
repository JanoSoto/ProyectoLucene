But we are there as well, we are back in the 1970s and 80s with the lead character as they lead a relatively upbeat and happy-go-lucky life initially before the tragedy strikes. The lead is Gerry Conlon (Day-Lewis), a young Northern Irishman from Belfast who is living a life surrounded by IRA-led activity in the 1970s without ever directly being involved, but he is the sort of guy who gets caught in the cross-fire; a sort of 'wrong place, wrong time' scenario-led life that will catch up with him in horrific ways later on. When we first see Gerry, the likable rouge attitude and relatively odd choice of song by way of Jimi Hendrix sees him get chased by British troops that mistake him for an IRA sniper &#x96; the scene has a fair amount of 'fun' to it; something that is brought back down to Earth later on.There is a sad irony and that is that it is proposed Gerry should move away from Northern Ireland following these scenes in order to get away from the troubles. Gerry agrees and takes a boat over to England with a friend named Paul Hill (Lynch), before briefly settling down in London. Initially, the film plays on Gerry being a bit of a misfit in this new setting; he mixes mostly with casual drug takers, hippies and devout, air headed female vegetarians. This unconnected and grounded realism driven segment in the film is impressive and mysterious. Having no knowledge of who these people are and what eventually happens to them will have you see the film as this wandering and series of supposedly random events in a specific time setting as Gerry wanders the streets; talks to tramps, thieves from the homes of those that accidentally drop their keys right outside the front door and looks for short stay accommodation here and there.But what follows is a change in gear and a change in study, indeed a change that encompasses desperation; mistaken identity; the hunt for redemption and the forcing of confronting issues regarding the relationship with one's father. A bomb is detonated within the vicinity of Gerry's general area one night and he is singled out by the police for his Irish roots and the fact he has only very recently arrived in England. He is jailed, with his father, as a part of the 'Maguire Seven', before desperately trying to claim justice. As a lead character, Gerry later embodies all the innocent and necessary traits for a victim just trying to survive. The film's point of attack takes special care in painting a wavy image for Gerry, one that sees him rob apartments of money, joke about with his mates and come across as quite antagonistic at times.Gerry and his father's, named Giuseppe (Postlethwaite), coming together in prison provide some of the more fascinating scenes in the film; a forced period of bonding during which they humblingly make peace and mend the past problems that they shared from years gone by.

Superman Returns had some really neat and nice effects but the movie just moved too slow to leave a lasting impression on me. Same I found with X-Men (which I repeat I saw after I saw Superman Returns).The movie of X-Men just fails to weave all the pieces together. It is about a group of mutants divided into two sections. One led by a good man named Xavier, a psychic who believes that the powers of the mutants can be used for the good of the mankind and the other section led by Magneto, a man who believes in condemning humans. And needless to say, the movie is all about how the bad guys scheme in order to get their work done and somehow the good guys managed to prevent them. And no points for guessing - no prominent good guy dies in the end.The special effects are decent. But I always believed that there is nothing in this world that can substitute a good old close-up fight. CGI rarely manages to give you the impact that a good-old staged fight can give you. The best example is the comparison of fight between Jackie Chan's CGI based The Medallion and the older movies of Chan where he does everything for real. None of the fights were truly enjoyable to me. And I also do not believe that it is the fact that the fighters are not humans that ticked me off. Because even in the Matrix trilogy, the fighters were superhuman but the movie makers managed to add some believable aspect to the movie.Maybe, just maybe, it is possible that for someone who has read the original X-Men comic books by Marvel might like the movie for it gives them a chance to see their comic book characters come alive but for someone like me who wants the story told from scratch, I do not see anything great in this movie.

In Glory, based on the real letters of Union Col. Robert Gould Shaw of the Massachusetts 54th, America's first black regiment in the Civil War has to battle prejudice and its soldiers own devaluing of their personal worth. That is the enemy, and overcoming it is how they achieve glory on the battlefield.The film follows Shaw, played by Matthew Broderick in his first dramatic leading role to which he finds a mild measure of success. Shaw survives Antietum when he asked by the Mass. governor and Frederick Douglass himself to lead the first black regiment. Not only is the racial barrier a thick one, but Shaw must battle his own uncertainties of being in command and how to deal with others of similar rank who abuse that power. When Shaw realizes his men are merely being used to do the labor of the army, he fights for their right to see battle -- essentially their dignity and glory.Broderick's style caters best to the softer, sympathetic sides of his character as well as the courageous moments, but as a commanding military presence, his performance comes up a bit flat. Still, he is supported by the tremendous talents of Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman. Washington breaks out in a huge way in this film as Pvt. Trip, a quick-tempered rabble-rouser who usually plays devil's advocate to the all the Civil Rights sentiments in the film, a role that earned him a best supporting Oscar. Freeman's performance as the more responsible, level-headed soldier is only overshadowed by the other film he released at the time, Driving Miss Daisy. Also impressive are Cary Elwes of The Princess Bride as Maj. Forbes and John Finn as the loud Irish Sgt. Maj. Mulcahy.Glory also lives up to its title in the way it is crafted.

Wagner in the film's final battle, all set to a majestic James Horner score. Glory might be Zwick's most Academy-recognized film (which he directed), but his films have most importantly continued to tell the untold stories of heroism all over the world in an entertaining and engaging way.The story is brilliantly crafted by making us feel good by showing people like Shaw breaking racial barriers a whole century before Civil Rights, but then fueling our emotions by introducing characters in power or situations where prejudice trumps this progressive and empowering movement of the story.

Unbeknownst to them the cases contain Dracula and Frankenstein's monster and that Dracula has a plan to take the brain of a weak-willed individual and put it into the monster. While delivering the crates (on a typically dark and stormy night), Wilbur is sure that he has seen Dracula rise from his coffin but of course nobody believes him &#x96; nobody except Larry Talbot, who has come to hunt down Dracula. Of course, since nothing is simple, Talbot has his own issues as he was once bitten by a werewolf.Like several other people on this site, I think my love of Abbott and Costello can be dated back to when I was younger and they used to be on daytime TV during the school holidays. It has been quite some time since I actually watched them in earnest and recently I have been watching a few of them again. This has been a bit of a revelation as I learn that, while they have not changed, my sense of humour has and it has meant that some of their films are just too basic. With this film though I actually quite enjoyed it. Although it really hurt the monster franchise at the time, this monster movie provides an enjoyable frame for them to do their usual shtick. In this the film is generally engaging as a story (of sorts) but also has plenty of moments that drew chuckles from me. It helps immensely that both Bud and Lou are in good shape and seem up for the film &#x96; an impression that I didn't always get from some of their later films.The support cast are very good as well and it helps that this is not a spoof so much as it is using the characters in an affectionate comedy. Chaney Jr, Lugosi and Strange all play their parts straight and it works better than I expected it to - they are not just stooges to have laughs played off them and this adds to the film. Of course it is still Abbott and Costello and if you hate them then you'll hate this but, as a casual fan, I found this an amusing affair with plenty of chuckles and a good structure.

It's a film that says that at heart, we're all good-natured kids that wish we could be irresponsible every so often.This is Porky's only point, both its hindrance and most celebrated characteristic. There isn't any character development or a through plot line -- going to the strip club Porky's is only representative of two major scenes in the movie. It's about high school kids horsing around and trying to get laid in Florida in the '50s. There are some admirable but pointless subplots fixed on anti-Semitism and parent abuse, but it's just about laughs.What makes Porky's unique is that it's about laughter, it's not just about creating it for the sake of being a comedy film. A stand-out scene is when the strict oafish gym teacher Ms.Ballbricker is explaining to the principal her plan to identify a trouble-making student by lining up several of the boys to examine their manhood. In the background, two of the students are dying from laughter and even the principal at one point can't hold it in any longer -- then a nice close-up of a portrait of President Eisenhower with a big grin on his face. That sums up Porky's nicely we all need to laugh at the ridiculousness and humor of certain situations. If only the film spent a bit more time hammering that in instead of meandering about like a bored high schooler.This is a film you can watch over and over again, not only because it can be funny for all appropriate ages, but it only thrives from scene to scene. The entire high school-aged fantasy of boys getting spy on the girls' showers owes its birth to this film, the hilarity as the new gym coach learns why the attractive young girls' coach is nicknamed Lassie, and of course that ultimate revenge against the powers that be, in this case Porky and his redneck sheriff brother, who try and stop kids from having fun. It can be watched one scene at a time -- there's nothing gluing it all together.Bob Clark's film has a carefree and reckless attitude that resembles that of his characters, but as admirable as that is -- and a rare find in a movie indeed, especially comedy -- there's no doubt that Porky's avoids being the kind of coming-of-age film it could have been.

The attractive Gen X cast often find themselves in this area(..because this is where Malone wants to set the action, hoping to guarantee a roller-coaster ride for horror fans)looking to find a method of escape after the steel doors close them in.Taye Diggs(..as an ex baseball star)and the stunner Ali Larter(..as an assistant to a VP, assuming her identity to win the million)are set up as the heroes(..it's quite obvious)with Rush deliciously over-the-top as Price(..nice homage to Vincent). The film, as the original does, retains the passionate hate stewing between Price and Evelyn(..also establishing the same faux death with an accomplice\/lover among the cast of characters). Janssen is smoldering even if she's a bitch always offering biting comments to those who annoy her. Chris Kattan is no Elisha Cook, Jr, but I found him amusing as the fidgety Watson Pritchett, extremely afraid of the house, who just wants to get out as fast as possible. Peter Gallagher basically plays type as a seemingly trustworthy physician, ultimately not who he seems. Bridgette Wilson is a rejected television star hoping to find another gig through what she might capture in the house by her camcorder(..the camcorder is brilliantly utilized by Malone as a device to project the supernatural, also echoing THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT in one regard). My real complaint was the ending, once the evil force rears it's ugly head and chases after those it wishes to consume, Malone abandoning the practical scare tactics in favor of CGI spookery(..he did this as well in FEARDOTCOM)..it features something that drives me nuts, characters standing still watching in shock as it comes towards them with me screaming at the screenRUN..YOU NITWITS! and the conclusion, regarding their reward is preposterous.As far as the casting goes, I was very pleased with Rush assuming Vincent Price's role. Rush really plays it to the brink, not holding back, appropriate for the material I think. The supporting cast in the original was rather colorless, to be honest, so I couldn't really complain too much about the beautiful ensemble assembled here. I didn't think any of them was that bad, although the constant profanity really wasn't needed(..fitting the word f#ck in the middle of actual words really isn't necessary, is it?). KNB(Kurtzman, Nicotero, Berger)were behind some of the grisly effects(..such as Wilson and Gallagher's fates)and there's a really nightmarish sequence involving Price, trapped in a schitzophrenic chamber that delivers the goods. Malone also uses the fish eye lens effectively to often distort the frame, creating some discomforting visuals of the characters walking through the house, not knowing what lie ahead.

The North\/South attitudes of the recently fought Civil War still resonate, with several allusions to the cause of the South and Shane himself calls out Jack Wilson (Palance) by calling him a dirty Yankee liar, an interesting choice of words which worked in the fifties.

As a result, Miller hitches a ride with the band on their cross-country tour, befriending the band, sharing in their experiences, falling in love, and chasing his dream. Being a fan of the music of the era, this film had additional appeal to me as Crowe shares his experiences of going behind the scenes to witness the trials and tribulations of a rising band.The casting in this film was fantastic. This film was Patrick Fugit's first feature performance and he did great job as the film's centerpiece, William Miller.

Lumet does the same thing he does with 12 Angry Men in this film, he simply, without any tricks or fancy work expose us to the flaws of the law and justice, and how the rich nearly always gain the upper hand, but not always as this film shows. As Frank Galvin (Newman) says the court gives the poor and powerless a chance and sometimes they can walk out with something.Paul Newman proves in 'The Verdict' why his name stands amongst the Hollywood elite; his performance is truly magnificent. He plays a drunk, divorced, washed up Boston lawyer with a losing streak who gets a second chance to redeem himself. His boss\/partner brings him a case so easy to settle out of court that he could make a bunch of money and not worry about a thing; about a Boston Catholic Hospital who administered the wrong anaesthetic to a young woman and destroyed her life; she is in a coma; deprived of speech, sound and vision. Galvin visits the Catholic bishop in relation to St. Catherine's hospital for a quick settlement, but on his way there he goes to see the girl; he sees the pain, destruction of a life... Galvin rejects $210,000 ($70,000) which would go straight in his pockets. Why? He can't be paid off to look the other way while a girl is paralysed and dying on a hospital bed. He takes them to court, despite disbelief from both the opposition and the judge himself.The story follows, as the powerful, defence attorney team rattle Newman's cage, through a variety of ways, leaving him with no ideas; but he fights, he does not surrender, he has a truth to fight for, he wants real justice, he wants redemption, and he gets it eventually... He wins the case not on masterful inquisitiveness of the law, but working as a decent human being relying on the humanity of the jurors to see beyond all the smoke and mirrors of the defence...The Verdict has great qualities; its the kind of film that is cathartic, satisfying while entertaining and superbly acted.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 May 2009","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The Verdict (1982)Top 3 - 1982The Verdict, another excellent achievement for the magnificent Sidney Lumet (12 Angry Men) is the kind of film that shakes the insides, makes you think and consider things such as truth, morality, redemption and justice.

This is the second Kurosawa feature I've seen, the first being Seven Samurai. The man certainly was an artist. The concept smoothly avoids being a gimmick, as it could easily have turned into in the hands of someone not sufficiently talented, and is instead a well-used device, through which base human emotions and responses are explored, as well as relationships, good and evil, and more. Any piece of expression that so skillfully encourages its audience to think - without ever seeming like a lecture - should be respected and appreciated. The story-telling is excellent. The acting is spot-on, from all involved. The minimal cast and amount of settings are well-utilized, and keeps the focus sharp. The plot never loses the viewers' interest, and in fact only gets increasingly deep and fascinating as it goes. While the subject of this is a sexual crime, the way it's handled is immensely tasteful. The visuals are impeccable, and cinematography and editing are amazing. This could arguably, along with much of Hitchcock's work, be cited as the origins of the utter tidal wave of twist endings(often overshadowing all else about those movies, including, but not limited to, consideration being put into ensuring that said surprise even makes sense) that have hit popular cinema in recent years, however, milestones sometimes do cause negatives, and they shouldn't be blamed for that.
