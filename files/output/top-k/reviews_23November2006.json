I don't care what some of you say, this was the BEST! Everything was great about the movie. The music I loved, much better than anything Disney, although there are a couple Disney movies I still like. And to the guy who compared it to Disney, the difference is that none of the characters on screen are singing. The songs are just part of the music, not part of the story. Disney songs stop the action. It's the complete opposite with Transformers; some of the best scenes happen while the songs are playing. The story was awesome with very small errors that can easily be fixed. Like all the other people, it was extremely shocking to see my favorite heroes die (my favorite, Brawn was the first to go), but that's life. And I was over 10 years old when I first saw the movie, so I took it a bit better than some kids. On the opposite side of the coin, I was shocked (in a completely different sort of way) when Galvatron killed Starscream. I hated him, so naturally I was glad they got rid of him (not totally, as it turned out, but at least that got a decent explanation) as well as the Insecticons (villains who take control of other people's minds are the worst villains if you ask me). Anyway, I enjoyed every single minute of this spetacular movie, & the post-movie episodes were my favorite episodes.BOTTOM LINE 100\/10 Watch it, no matter the cost. Cause if you don't I'll crush you with my bare hands! Just kidding about that last line. The rest I really mean.

So proclaimed chubby Lou Costello upon reading the script for the movie that turned around the duo's career, which had been deep in the doldrums at the time. Apparently, $50,000 and the promise that Charles Barton would direct eventually changed his mind, and the movie went on to become Universal International's second highest grossing film of the year.Shame.Even as a kid, I never really took to Abbott & Costello &#150; not once I was old enough to perceive the difference between their brand of humour and that of Laurel and Hardy, the double act to whom they are usually compared. There's something distinctly mean-spirited about this couple, as if they're friends only through circumstance, and that neither of them would hesitate to abandon the other the moment something better came along. The violence between Laurel & Hardy was always cartoonish and borne out of frustration; you never doubted that, at heart, they were friends who cared for one another &#150; just look at how often they stuck up for each other when a third party became involved in the fun &#150; but, more often than not, Abbott & Costello's violence is just plain spiteful. Bud Abbott slaps little Lou to keep him in line and for the slightest reason, and the hapless Lou accepts it all like a frightened child who fails to realise that he doesn't have to. A&C and L&H are poles apart and, if it wasn't for the fact that they worked for different studios, you might be forgiven for thinking that A&C lived off the scraps that L&H rejected.This movie &#150; the team's 22nd, and their fourth with Barton &#150; is generally regarded to be their best effort, but it's hard to see why. It was innovative in its day for poking fun at Universal's established movie monsters (whose movie careers, like that of the comedy duo, had declined considerably over the previous five years), something that had never been done before but, apart from a couple of one-liners (You and 20 million other guys, says Lou after wolfman Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney) explains how he turns into a wolf every night when the moon is full), the quality of the gags is nothing special. Too much time is spent on Lou pulling those faces of his, and then trying to convince Bud that he isn't imagining all the spooks that mysteriously disappear when the straight man finally appears on the scene.The storyline has Bud and Lou playing a couple of railway baggage attendants who are instructed to deliver a couple of crates which contain Dracula (Bela Lugosi &#150; who got the role when the producers discovered he wasn't dead after all) and Frankenstein's monster (Glenn Strange). Lou's girlfriend (Lenore Aubert) works at the house, and has plans to transplant his brain into the monster. Also involved is the wolfman (Lon Chaney Jr.) &#150; in a good guy role for a change. There's a lot of padding, even though the movie runs less than 90 minutes, and it's all too evident.On a more positive note, the monsters play it straight, which strengthens the film considerably; the special effects for this movie are actually pretty good for the period, although Dracula's transformation from bat to human is obviously a cartoon; and Jane Randolph, in her last role before retiring to marry a Spaniard named Jaime del Amo and lead the life of a socialite, looks pretty hot. The climactic chase sequence is also well-staged, and goes at least some way towards atoning for the tedious abundance of mugging and slapstick that precedes it.   ","genre":null},{"date":"23 November 2006","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" No way I'll do that c**p.

Childhood friend Searless joins him as a private in the unit while the majority are slaves, seeking freedom and the chance to fight alongside the white soldiers. Although there is no real political will to see black soldiers on the battle field the unit's training begins while Gould struggles with prejudices and resistance from his superiors and peers as well as from within his own unit.I approached this film with a certain amount of trepidation as I braced myself for a massive slice of sentimental revisionist pie. And in a way that is what this is but it somehow manages to stay just on the right side of things to make for an effective film. The plot pretty much writes itself as we go through training, see everyone learn lessons and eventually get to the final battle scene; saying it like this perhaps demeans the material but this is essentially what it is about. The script is weak when it comes to characters. Aside from Gould, the other characters in the regiment are all fictional and mostly they are stock characters that are mostly pigeonholed into easy slots. While this does weaken the depth of the material it does not limit the emotional sweep &#150; which is pretty much what Zwick seems to be after. Lessons are learnt and characters formed and, although it is rather superficial it is engagingly professional.A lot of the credit for this belongs with the actors who perform better than some of their material deserves. Broderick leads the cast well although at times he is all a bit too dignified and worthy. His support is better in the regiment, which includes a typically solid turn from Freeman (was he ever not the old wise man type?), Washington is fiery and engaging &#150; a touch too modern perhaps but still with an effective performance. Elwes works well with Broderick and helps balance his character out a tad. Braugher shows the class that would later mark him out as being head and shoulders above his HLOTS peers while the rest of the cast features turns from faces such as Gunton, Saunders and others. Zwick's direction in the battle scenes are impressive and it is depressingly convincing in how people are cut down. If I had one complaint it would be the sparing of main characters for the majority of the film; although I understand the cinematic reasons for this, it does rather undo the brutal and random nature of the violence. Having said that though, it is hard not to be impacting by the intense battles and the emotions of loss.Overall then an impressive film even if it is not one that I think deserves the amount of unquestioning praise that is lavished upon it on these pages.

","genre":"Drama, History, War"},{"date":"23 November 2006","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Perhaps the most significant thing about this masterpiece from Alfred Hitchcock is that it is the film which broke Jimmy Stewart. Hitchcock took the ultimate nice guy, the honest, likable everyman of heart-warming Frank Capra romantic comedies and gradually turned him into an obsessive, mentally deranged control freak. A very deliberate stroke of genius in casting, but it is only one of many things that make this an incredible picture.Hitchcock's films are not known for their visual style. There was always the occasional attention grabbing close-up or freakish angle, but by and large he made his impact through pacing, plotting and expressionist arrangement. Vertigo is the exception &#150; it really is a feast for the eyes. Most important are the colours, a fact which Hitchcock establishes right from the start with the kaleidoscopic opening credit sequence. He shows full mastery of Technicolor, comparable to the films of Michael Powell. Each location has its own colour scheme &#150; neutral light browns for Midge's flat, traffic-light red for Ernie's restaurant, glowing green for the hotel where Judy stays. The green motif &#150; here symbolising rebirth &#150; crops up again and again in relation to Madeleine and Judy. Even the water she attempts to drown herself in has a greenish sheen to it.One thing that characterises Hitchcock's films is that, no matter how complicated the plot is, it is conveyed in a way that the film can be understood in a single viewing. You're never left wondering who some minor character was supposed to be or confused about some character's motivation. Vertigo is no exception, although it is one of the most complex and twisting plots of any Hitchcock picture. He dispenses with his trademark suspense (with the exception of the red-herring opening scene, Scotty is never actually placed in any danger) and plunges into the depths of his psychological streak. It is perhaps also Hitch's only genuine film noir, although it is rarely referenced as such (probably because noirs are typically in black and white). It does however have all the typical noir elements &#150; a femme fatale who leads the hero astray, a kind but plain woman who loves him and, in between the two, an upstanding, well-meaning lead man whose life unravels because of his own faults.Vertigo is also as abstract as Hitchcock's early Fritz Lang-inspired efforts, but here done infused with the more confident later Hitchcock style. There are colour filters, dream-like cinematography (particularly good in the sequoia forest sequence), the famous zooming-in, dollying-out technique and an animated dream sequence. The dazzling imagery could be seen as prefiguring the influence of psychedelia a decade later, although really it is perhaps only the logical extension of the German Expressionist style. It's only really an updated version of the superimposing of images and casting of shadows in films by Fritz Lang and FW Murnau. For this reason Hitchcock could be called one of the truest heirs of the German Expressionist movement, and not just for the psychological angle.It's an amazing accomplishment of both lead actors that they are both essentially playing two different characters each. James Stewart starts off in his comfortable, familiar friendly type that he is used to playing, but by the end of the picture he has transformed into an cruel, obsessive monster. Kim Novak also plays two very different roles as the prim, icy Madeleine and the worldly and down-to-earth Judy. Barbara Bel Geddes gives a great supporting role as Midge.Another thing worth a mention is Bernard Hermann's score. I'm not a big fan of Hermann, but I'd say this is his best score for Hitchcock. He matches the action perfectly. There are several long sections without dialogue, and here the music plays a similar role to a silent film score. In fact the timing of every element in the film is spot on &#150; one example being a wave crashing on the shore in the background when Scotty and Madeleine first kiss.The first time I saw Vertigo I was hooked, right from the opening moments to the final shot. While its power to hold me has diminished somewhat over repeated viewings (a weakness of all Hitchcock films, the flipside to their being instantly enjoyable) it still looks amazing and it can still send shivers down my spine. It's an incredible achievement.

It's only really an updated version of the superimposing of images and casting of shadows in films by Fritz Lang and FW Murnau. For this reason Hitchcock could be called one of the truest heirs of the German Expressionist movement, and not just for the psychological angle.It's an amazing accomplishment of both lead actors that they are both essentially playing two different characters each. James Stewart starts off in his comfortable, familiar friendly type that he is used to playing, but by the end of the picture he has transformed into an cruel, obsessive monster. Kim Novak also plays two very different roles as the prim, icy Madeleine and the worldly and down-to-earth Judy. Barbara Bel Geddes gives a great supporting role as Midge.Another thing worth a mention is Bernard Hermann's score. I'm not a big fan of Hermann, but I'd say this is his best score for Hitchcock. He matches the action perfectly. There are several long sections without dialogue, and here the music plays a similar role to a silent film score. In fact the timing of every element in the film is spot on &#150; one example being a wave crashing on the shore in the background when Scotty and Madeleine first kiss.The first time I saw Vertigo I was hooked, right from the opening moments to the final shot.

Hitchcock took the ultimate nice guy, the honest, likable everyman of heart-warming Frank Capra romantic comedies and gradually turned him into an obsessive, mentally deranged control freak. A very deliberate stroke of genius in casting, but it is only one of many things that make this an incredible picture.Hitchcock's films are not known for their visual style. There was always the occasional attention grabbing close-up or freakish angle, but by and large he made his impact through pacing, plotting and expressionist arrangement. Vertigo is the exception &#150; it really is a feast for the eyes. Most important are the colours, a fact which Hitchcock establishes right from the start with the kaleidoscopic opening credit sequence. He shows full mastery of Technicolor, comparable to the films of Michael Powell. Each location has its own colour scheme &#150; neutral light browns for Midge's flat, traffic-light red for Ernie's restaurant, glowing green for the hotel where Judy stays. The green motif &#150; here symbolising rebirth &#150; crops up again and again in relation to Madeleine and Judy. Even the water she attempts to drown herself in has a greenish sheen to it.One thing that characterises Hitchcock's films is that, no matter how complicated the plot is, it is conveyed in a way that the film can be understood in a single viewing. You're never left wondering who some minor character was supposed to be or confused about some character's motivation. Vertigo is no exception, although it is one of the most complex and twisting plots of any Hitchcock picture. He dispenses with his trademark suspense (with the exception of the red-herring opening scene, Scotty is never actually placed in any danger) and plunges into the depths of his psychological streak. It is perhaps also Hitch's only genuine film noir, although it is rarely referenced as such (probably because noirs are typically in black and white). It does however have all the typical noir elements &#150; a femme fatale who leads the hero astray, a kind but plain woman who loves him and, in between the two, an upstanding, well-meaning lead man whose life unravels because of his own faults.Vertigo is also as abstract as Hitchcock's early Fritz Lang-inspired efforts, but here done infused with the more confident later Hitchcock style. There are colour filters, dream-like cinematography (particularly good in the sequoia forest sequence), the famous zooming-in, dollying-out technique and an animated dream sequence. The dazzling imagery could be seen as prefiguring the influence of psychedelia a decade later, although really it is perhaps only the logical extension of the German Expressionist style.

Although this would seem like a rewarding job the reality is that Crock is a bitter, stingy and unlikeable spinster who barely pays Fillmore for his work. Determined to stay out of some half-assed reason developed by the writers, Fillmore decides that the only way to get money is to kidnap the old woman's prized possession - her dog. Of course he and friend Rusty mess it up but the police assume the note they leave actually means someone has kidnapped Fillmore. Hilarity, as they say, ensues.It is the score early on that should have warned me what I was getting into. You see, this film regularly uses that sort of quirky background music that wacky films tend to use - presumably to help inject a comic air into proceedings and fill the energy gap left by the material. It is rarely a good sign and the more over used it is, the worse it often is. So anyway I stuck with this terribly contrived affair that has a plot that manages to be all over the place while also remaining totally predictable (you unfortunately have to see it to see what I mean). The fact that the plot is nonsense should surprise nobody, as long as it is funny right? Well, right, but the problem is that this isn't funny. It isn't terrible but laughs are few and far between and perhaps I was only laughing at some things because I had been starved of comedy by much of the film (I mean - should a man hitting people with a desk lamp be the high point of any film?).The cast mostly can do little with the meagre scraps they are served with and I was genuinely surprised how many names had somehow read this script but yet still signed up for it. MacDonald is not someone I'm familiar with but you can see the influence that Schneider and Sandler have had on him as a comedian - and I don't mean that as a compliment. He is annoying and I found myself less and less interested in him as the film went on - even semi-decent lines crumble as they left his whiny mouth. Chappelle deserves better but at least his performance is funny and the only laughs this film gave me were due to him. God only knows what DeVito and Benzai thought they were signing up to; both are poor and their weak material only serves to make them look worse. Stritch is an obvious character with an obvious performance and a character that Futurama has been doing better for years.Overall then, a very lame comedy that produces so few laughs that Trading Standards really should be looking into IMDb's listing of this film as a comedy. Some will love this level of stuff of course but for the majority of viewers this will only do the job on a really, really empty evening where you just want to veg out.

I notice a lot of criticism has been aimed towards this film and I really struggle to understand why there isn't more love for this film. It rates extremely high on the entertainment and, although very far fetched, the plot is conceptually fantastic and well conceived. The general plot is familiar to Timebomb with Michael Biehn and of Bourne Identity with Matt Damon but the mother &#150; daughter sub plot is what really makes this stand out as it is in extreme contrast to the violence and mayhem that is going on.Long Kiss Goodnight begins somewhat unspectacularly with a narration containing mediocre dialogue for exposition purposes but luckily doesn't last particularly long. It would have been better of the narration occurred during the credits but after the patchy start, the film really goes off with a bang. Before you know it, you have just witnessed a car accident complete with blood, fire and a deer with a snapped neck! Harlin does a great job at illustrating the bond between Samantha (Davis) and her daughter before Samantha goes off to discover her past which makes Samantha's relentless transformation in to Charly very surprising to witness. Once Charly has fully emerged, the set pieces never stop and the audience is barely given a chance to breathe. The ending is very climatic and although at is predictable, it by no means is boring! There is also a conspiracy theory that develops throughout the film as the audience are left uninformed regarding the mysterious 'Honeymoon Project' which helps add to the tension.Geena Davis is awesome in this film. She starts as this character with amnesia who reminded me of her character in The Fly, very friendly and happy, and then transforms in to this super sexy bad ass. She pulls off both personalities very convincingly and shows a phenomenal range within this role. People may argue that a role playing a slightly crazed government assassin is easy but the role in its entirety requires a lot of depth. I think this is Geena Davis' best role, more so than Beatlejuice and Thelma and Louise as she was the focal character on a massive scale. I like Samuel L. Jackson but I think he is a victim of his own success as writers and directors like giving him lots of cool dialogue but it often leads to him chewing scenery and taking away from the main point of the film (Pulp Fiction got away with it). Here this doesn't happen as Davis doesn't let him and his character is a lot more sensitive than his usual roles. The rapport between these characters is very effective and gives some light relief to what is going on. Craig Bierko is a great villain he has that innocent charm that makes him look like he wouldn't hurt a fly. He constantly maintains this ice cool exterior despite the fact that his past is catching up with him and disturbing his plans. Yvonne Zima as Samantha's daughter, Caitlin, puts in a very mature performance for a 7 year old and is very effective at pulling at the heart strings of the audience.With the director of Die Hard 2 and the writer of Lethal Weapon on board, Long Kiss Goodnight had a great team behind it and this is why the action is of such great quality. The gratuitous gun play and excessive violence do not disturb at all because everything is so theatrical making it entertaining rather than shocking. There seems to be plenty of evidence of money well spent as I'd much rather see money spent on pyrotechnics and stunt scenes than on CGI. This is what makes it so disappointing that the film did so poorly in the box office.A film that has undeservedly been overlooked, Long Kiss Goodnight is a great, sexy action thriller that has a touching human story embedded in the plot. I could definitely watch this film over and over again, especially if I skip the opening scene. Geena Davis and Samuel L.

You see, when he started out in Broadway productions he was a juvenile actor. He played young social butterfly types (hard to believe, isn't it?). But there was a rational reason to think this, among the producers on Broadway - young man Bogart came from a prominent upper middle class family in Manhattan. His father was Dr. Bogart, a physician to wealthy people. His mother was an magazine artist. So yes...one could easily see that young Mr. Bogart would be used to saying things like Tennis anyone now and then...and so could play the young friend of the hero or the caddish social butterfly false lover or...well you can picture it! It is with great respect to Humphrey Bogart's determination to be a real actor...to play real people...that he broke out of this cul-de-sac of juveniles and ended up in the roles he is loved for Rick Blaine, Sam Spade, Charlie Allnut, Fred C.

Not light hearted society types we will never meet in a million years.Yet Bogie did return to this arena once in his later career - after his only Oscar. In 1954 he played Linus Larribee, older of a pair of brothers (his younger brother is William Holden as David Larribee) who are the heirs to an industrial and shipping empire headed by their father Oliver Larribee (Walter Hampden). Into their upper class lives descends Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn), the daughter of the family chauffeur Fairchild (John Williams). She has long had a crush on David, a real playboy, and once even tried to commit suicide (to be saved by Linus, without his realizing it was a planned suicide). She goes to Paris to study cooking, and returns after two years a sophisticated, attractive woman. And she turns the world of the Larribees upside down.There is a merger in the works between Larribee Industries and the largest sugar cane plantation owner in Puerto Rico (Francis X. Bushman), whose daughter (Martha Hyer) has always liked David. David is not crazy about this, and when he is reintroduced to the new Sabrina he is knocked off his feet. This jeopardizes the entire business plan (which involves using the sugar to manufacture a new type of all-purpose plastic that the Larribees have the patent rights to). Linus, who is the ant to David's grasshopper, is determined to undue the effect of Sabrina on his brother, and (if necessary) romance her himself. He does...only to find that she is quite intoxicating, and that he is falling in love with her.It has been suggested that Bogart was wrong in this film (like Gary Cooper was in Billy Wilder's other Hepburn comedy, LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON), because he was too old and his image didn't fit. Well, it is true that we have another May - September relationship here, and that Bogart's personae after his string of memorable performances was not as a financial type. Cary Grant, the original choice for the role, might have seemed better. But Grant is as much a misfire here as Bogart appears to be. The problem is Holden. One can see Bogart as a hard working type and Holden's older brother quite easily, but Grant (with his English accent)would have made Holden seem out-of-place. They would have had to change the Larribees into a transplanted English family in America to make Grant fit in perfectly. That might have worked - but it would have strained belief.Bogart rarely played comic roles after 1940, but in his late 1950s films he did do comedy a bit more (here, in BEAT THE DEVIL, and in WE'RE NO ANGEL). He demonstrates a natural gift for delivering comic lines (after David has an accident with a pair of drinking glasses he sat on, he is recovering and wants to write a poem to Sabrina about the accident - when he asks Linus\/Bogart for a rhyme with glass, with a slight pause Linus\/Bogart suggests alas). His performance is enhanced with his film partners Holden, Hepburn, and Williams and (best of all) Hampden.Williams is quite upset at the idea of his daughter marrying any of the Larribees. He is quite class conscious (and admits it), and in one of Bogart's best moments he tells Williams he is a snob! As for Hampden, one can only bless Wilder for casting him. Walter Hampden was one of Broadway's leading stars (especially in Shakespearean roles) between the teens and the 1930s. His production of HAMLET was considered one of the best ever on the American stage. But he arrived late in Hollywood, and although an impressive character actor rarely got any impressive role. His performance as Oliver Larribee, the last vestige of robber baron elitism in American society is wonderful. This includes his hiding his huge cigars from his wife (he is caught smoking in Linus' clothes closet at one point) to his sputtering about a young débutante with an Adlai Stevenson button.

It is a film about the supernatural that is not a horror film. It is a comedy which takes as its theme violent death, but which is optimistic in tone rather than black or cynical. It is a romantic comedy in which the leading man dies during the first half-hour. And it is a film that breaks the rules and yet remains within the commercial Hollywood mainstream rather than branching out into art-house experimentalism.When Sam Wheat, a New York banker, is murdered in the course of what appears to be a robbery, his spirit remains on earth in the form of a ghost. The ghostly Sam quickly realises that his death was no random mugging gone wrong and that he was murdered because he had stumbled onto the fact that his bank was being used by criminals to launder money. Sam also realises that his girlfriend Molly is also in danger from the criminals who killed him, and tries to warn her.The film takes a fairly traditional view of the afterlife. (Much more traditional than, say, Beetlejuice, another film from around the same period). On death, the souls of the good are rewarded with heavenly bliss, while the souls of the wicked are dragged down to hell by demons. A few souls, however, those who have unfinished business in this life, remain on earth as ghosts. They can see the living, but cannot normally be seen by them or communicate with them. Sam cannot therefore appear directly to Molly or speak to her, and in desperation he tries to make contact with Oda Mae Brown, a medium. Oda Mae, in fact, is a charlatan who makes her living by deceiving her clients into believing that she has psychic powers, but for some reason she is able to hear Sam (although not to see him). She is persuaded to help Sam warn Molly of the danger she is in, and also to help him frustrate the schemes of Carl, his corrupt former colleague who is responsible for both the money-laundering scam and Sam's murder.The film contains a mixture of comedy and sentimentality. The comedy mostly comes in the scenes involving Oda Mae, well played by Whoopi Goldberg as that stock comic figure, the rogue with a (well-hidden) heart of gold who can (very reluctantly) be persuaded to do the decent thing. Goldberg has appeared in some very weak comedies, such as Jumpin' Jack Flash and A Knight in Camelot, but Ghost is one of her more successful roles. There are some very amusing scenes, such as the one where Oda Mae, using fake ID, manages to withdraw the $4,000,000 which the criminals have deposited in a false bank account and is then cajoled by Sam into giving the whole amount to a charity run by nuns rather than keeping it for herself.The sentimentality comes in the scenes between Sam and Molly, both before his murder and at the end when she realises that his love for her has survived his death. The film's most famous scene- indeed, one of the most iconic scenes in modern cinema- is the one where Sam embraces Molly while she is making a pot (she is a potter by profession), to the strains of Unchained Melody, and they end up making love. I will never think of pottery in the same way again. Or Unchained Melody, come to that, although the words of that song do seem very appropriate to the film's theme of longing for an absent loved one.I must admit that I had difficulty envisaging Patrick Swayze as one of the yuppie classes, but that is probably because I always think of him in terms of his working-class-hero character from Dirty Dancing. Demi Moore, however, made a delightful heroine, showing just why she was regarded as one of the hottest young actresses of the late eighties and early nineties. No actress since Audrey Hepburn had worn that short, boyish haircut with such style and elegance. The film as a whole can sometimes seem corny, but overall it is a watchable mixture of comedy and tenderness. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 November 2006","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Ghost is a film that breaks the normal rules.

Not to mention rewarding. Far more than you might imagine. It really is a wonderful film. I can't praise it enough. It is so good. And intelligent. And entertaining. All qualities in short supply in films nowadays but are in Pleasantville by the bucketload.Pleasantville was a little overshadowed in 1998 by The Truman Show, even though they're equally great films. But although they cover similar ground, they are quite different. They share the same conceit of television thrust upon the unsuspecting individual, but the worlds they inhabit are diametrically opposed. Truman's world was an artificial construct designed for him to interact with. But in the case of Pleasantville, this is a self-contained world with actual people who inhabit it. But all within the boundaries of television programming.Pleasantville is actually a 1950s sitcom. A cosy, b\/w world of picket fences, malt shops and bowling alleys. Everyone is happy. Everyone lives normal, untroubled lives. The weather is always perfect. And the people are perfectly content.In our world, David (Tobey Maguire) is a social outcast at school. And he has a distant relationship with his Mum and rebellious sister Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon). His only means of escape is the uncomplicated world of Pleasantville. While waiting for a Pleasantville marathon, a TV repairman turns up, and gives David a new remote control. When Jennifer wants to watch something else, they fight over the remote, and end up zapped inside Pleasantville.Taking on the characters of Bud and Mary-Sue, David and Jennifer begin to explore this new world. Their fictional parents are George and Betty Parker (two wonderful performances from William H Macy and especially Joan Allen). George is the strait-laced Father Knows Best, and Betty is the happy homemaker. But they're not really people. They're two-dimensional characters inhabiting a flat, insular, sexless, joyless environment.The first half of the film is enjoyable because it allows us time to speculate what the film might be about. Perhaps a witty, even gently scathing satire on classic American sitcoms and family values. Where these people are so touching in their naiveté, and so willing to believe in the noble intentions of others. But as the film progresses, it soon becomes more than enjoyable. It becomes extraordinary.Jennifer is unhappy. Geography lessons only consist of the world of Pleasantville. Books have no writing in them. Parents sleep in separate beds. And no-one has ever heard of sex. Jennifer changes that when she introduces the concept of sex to the captain of the basketball team. In Pleasantville, nobody ever loses at basketball. They make a basket every time. But now, after having sex, the captain misses. And that's only the beginning.David and Jennifer's presence begins to introduce startling changes. The kids are the first ones to notice. The basketball team are now missing almost every time. They're all discovering the sexual act. And their behaviour is starting to change. They actually now have a thirst for knowledge. After Jennifer accidentally introduces them to the joys of reading, now that the books are no longer blank, the kids want to learn more about the world beyond Pleasantville. A concept completely alien to them before.The characters of Pleasantville are beginning to think for themselves. They're becoming self-aware. And eventually, their self-discovery develops to the point where they're no longer two-dimensional, b\/w caricatures. But fully realised, three-dimensional, in-colour, individuals.Director Gary Ross is careful the way he introduces colour into the picture. It happens gradually. Like a red rose in a grey flower-bed. Or a green neon sign in a b\/w background. The way colour is utilised in this film is superb. The in-colour people stand out with an astonishing beauty. Or the breathtaking scene when David is driving through a b\/w grove showered by pink cherry blossoms. Those scenes resonate with a vitality that is just wonderful to watch.Eventually the adults start to catch on too. It's marvellously satisfying when Betty learns about orgasms from Jennifer, and as she slowly breaks out of the confines of her character, she eventually learns the joy of thinking for one's self. Initially when she goes to colour, she at first tries to hide it with makeup.But when she meets Mr Johnson (Jeff Daniels), the owner of a diner, she starts to reconsider her position. Mr Johnson discovers self-awareness through artistic expression. He loves to paint now that colour has entered the world of Pleasantville. And when he paints a portrait of Betty, she comes to cherish her individuality.Because of the sweeping changes, not everyone welcomes them. Big Bob (J T Walsh's final film role), the mayor insists on things staying the way they always have. And unites the people against the 'coloureds.'First and foremost, Pleasantville is a film of ideas. And its never short of them. Gary Ross manages to find an astonishing level of nuances, as well as a rich subtext. Covering everything from racism, feminism, teenage rebellion, homosexuality, sexual awareness and so on. It communicates the ideal of the sharing of new ideas through art, philosophy, literature, and how change is necessary for a society to survive. The people in b\/w represent those opposed to change. The acting is wonderful throughout, and I love the way the people become proud of their new identitiesGeorge Betty, whatever's happening to you. It will go away. Betty What if I don't want it to go away?The final scenes are exhilarating, as the whole town goes to colour. It appears so vibrant and beautiful, my heart soared with joy. The music is perfectly matched to the tone as well, creating joyous surges of well-being. I could go on praising Pleasantville all day. I love it so much. A true, modern classic. And a potent, symbolic message of hope and new ideals.Wonderful! Simply wonderful!

And he has a distant relationship with his Mum and rebellious sister Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon). His only means of escape is the uncomplicated world of Pleasantville. While waiting for a Pleasantville marathon, a TV repairman turns up, and gives David a new remote control. When Jennifer wants to watch something else, they fight over the remote, and end up zapped inside Pleasantville.Taking on the characters of Bud and Mary-Sue, David and Jennifer begin to explore this new world. Their fictional parents are George and Betty Parker (two wonderful performances from William H Macy and especially Joan Allen). George is the strait-laced Father Knows Best, and Betty is the happy homemaker. But they're not really people. They're two-dimensional characters inhabiting a flat, insular, sexless, joyless environment.The first half of the film is enjoyable because it allows us time to speculate what the film might be about. Perhaps a witty, even gently scathing satire on classic American sitcoms and family values. Where these people are so touching in their naiveté, and so willing to believe in the noble intentions of others. But as the film progresses, it soon becomes more than enjoyable. It becomes extraordinary.Jennifer is unhappy. Geography lessons only consist of the world of Pleasantville. Books have no writing in them. Parents sleep in separate beds. And no-one has ever heard of sex. Jennifer changes that when she introduces the concept of sex to the captain of the basketball team. In Pleasantville, nobody ever loses at basketball. They make a basket every time. But now, after having sex, the captain misses. And that's only the beginning.David and Jennifer's presence begins to introduce startling changes. The kids are the first ones to notice. The basketball team are now missing almost every time. They're all discovering the sexual act. And their behaviour is starting to change. They actually now have a thirst for knowledge. After Jennifer accidentally introduces them to the joys of reading, now that the books are no longer blank, the kids want to learn more about the world beyond Pleasantville. A concept completely alien to them before.The characters of Pleasantville are beginning to think for themselves. They're becoming self-aware. And eventually, their self-discovery develops to the point where they're no longer two-dimensional, b\/w caricatures. But fully realised, three-dimensional, in-colour, individuals.Director Gary Ross is careful the way he introduces colour into the picture. It happens gradually. Like a red rose in a grey flower-bed. Or a green neon sign in a b\/w background. The way colour is utilised in this film is superb. The in-colour people stand out with an astonishing beauty. Or the breathtaking scene when David is driving through a b\/w grove showered by pink cherry blossoms. Those scenes resonate with a vitality that is just wonderful to watch.Eventually the adults start to catch on too. It's marvellously satisfying when Betty learns about orgasms from Jennifer, and as she slowly breaks out of the confines of her character, she eventually learns the joy of thinking for one's self. Initially when she goes to colour, she at first tries to hide it with makeup.But when she meets Mr Johnson (Jeff Daniels), the owner of a diner, she starts to reconsider her position. Mr Johnson discovers self-awareness through artistic expression. He loves to paint now that colour has entered the world of Pleasantville. And when he paints a portrait of Betty, she comes to cherish her individuality.Because of the sweeping changes, not everyone welcomes them. Big Bob (J T Walsh's final film role), the mayor insists on things staying the way they always have. And unites the people against the 'coloureds.'First and foremost, Pleasantville is a film of ideas. And its never short of them. Gary Ross manages to find an astonishing level of nuances, as well as a rich subtext. Covering everything from racism, feminism, teenage rebellion, homosexuality, sexual awareness and so on. It communicates the ideal of the sharing of new ideas through art, philosophy, literature, and how change is necessary for a society to survive. The people in b\/w represent those opposed to change. The acting is wonderful throughout, and I love the way the people become proud of their new identitiesGeorge Betty, whatever's happening to you. It will go away. Betty What if I don't want it to go away?The final scenes are exhilarating, as the whole town goes to colour. It appears so vibrant and beautiful, my heart soared with joy. The music is perfectly matched to the tone as well, creating joyous surges of well-being. I could go on praising Pleasantville all day. I love it so much. A true, modern classic. And a potent, symbolic message of hope and new ideals.Wonderful! Simply wonderful!

Not to mention rewarding. Far more than you might imagine. It really is a wonderful film. I can't praise it enough. It is so good. And intelligent. And entertaining. All qualities in short supply in films nowadays but are in Pleasantville by the bucketload.Pleasantville was a little overshadowed in 1998 by The Truman Show, even though they're equally great films. But although they cover similar ground, they are quite different. They share the same conceit of television thrust upon the unsuspecting individual, but the worlds they inhabit are diametrically opposed. Truman's world was an artificial construct designed for him to interact with. But in the case of Pleasantville, this is a self-contained world with actual people who inhabit it.

It's very much a David Fincher with decay and desaturated colour tones everywhere, lots of grand, decaying buildings and a feeling of gloomy, low tech nostalgia sliding in at the sides, and that's very welcome, but it's not as gripping as some make out.It certainly isn't a *bad* film, by any stretch. The plot's well balanced, the characters nuanced and believable (except Brad Pitt who's such an annoying brat I can't see how anyone anywhere would hire him as a cop) and the dialogue is good enough (although really Morgan FReeman brings a real shine to it that Pitt can't match), with the exception of some slightly hammy bits.The main thing that seems to have gripped everybody is the serial killer's supposedly insanely clever twisted, creepy, dark, disturbing plan, but I don't really think it's as creepy as all that. Saw, a far less interesting film, was WAY creepier, although I suppose it borrowed heavily from Seven.Also, I don't really care much about how creepy serial killers are anyway, I think it's just a cheap titillation device.Where this film's most interesting is where Brad Pitt's character gets his come-uppance for being such an annoying little twerp. And even that feels a little bit cheap, there isn't a moment where he's on screen that he doesn't irritate, which may be the point, but it's a bit much to make an entire film about an evil serial killer just so you can give an imaginary jackass a slap in the face.But Morgan Freeman was good...

Gilliam (allegedly) produced a long list (think about the aircraft one from the Fifth Element) and handed it to Butch Bruce. It was entitled Things Bruce Willis Does When He Acts. It ended with a simple message saying please don't do any of the above in my movie.There is a fact about this movie (definitely true). Gilliam didn't have a hand in the writing.I would contend that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary (if not commercial) success that is The Twelve Monkeys.Visually, the Twelve Monkeys is all that we have rightly come to expect from a Gilliam film. It is also full of Gilliamesque surrealism and general (but magnificent) strangeness. Gilliam delights in wrong-footing his audience. Although the ending of the Twelve Monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real, Gilliam borrows heavily from Kafka in the clockwork, bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters towards their fate. It is this journey, and the character developments they undergo, which unsettles.I love Gilliam films (Brazil, in particular). But they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness. He seems to have so many ideas, and so much enthusiasm, that his films almost invariably end up as a tangled mess (Brazil, in particular). I still maintain that Brazil is Gilliam's tour de force, but there's no denying that The Twelve Monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the tight-plotting department.
