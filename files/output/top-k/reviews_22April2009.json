As Ripley arrives in Italy we see his method acting begin as he learns jazz, and practices his Italian before meeting Greenleaf. Soon the pair becomes close as they find common interests and we viewers are right in the heart of this charming tale about a guy who is now living the rich life with a caring charming friend and his fiancée, so where does it all go wrong? Minghella creates a subtle and almost sombre picture about loneliness and dreams that never quite reaches its full potential because of its mixed concepts. For example this never seems to target the right genre; there is simply too much space. The dramatic turn of events at the beginning place this into drama but halfway through there's a murder and now we're in crime thriller mode. This is then followed by some bizarre love concepts that have fans debating the sexual orientation of Ripley, which makes it further dramatic and the loophole continues with mystery and yet more crime. There is simply too much going on and the film is therefore punished.Perhaps this could have worked. Once Ripley starts playing with the idea of adopting Greenleaf's lifestyle we are right in the heart of a Catch Me if You Can concept that is too flaky for words. There are too many narrow escapes, unfathomable playing people and chance meeting timing in the story's context that would never happen in real life. So then the drama genre has been ruined and you are left with the thriller concept. On the run, enjoying the lifestyles, this gets the blood pumping at times but never generates the slickness that Spielberg's picture delivered with such ease.Damon is better than Di Caprio but at the cost of starring in the wrong picture. A Tom Ripley character could have thrived better in Catch Me but for the most part, Ripley lights a spark in the muddled tale of events in Italy.The location settings are established vivaciously by the director and the culture is well reflected with the inclusion of jazz music and the funeral scenes in the lake.You would imagine the book this is based on might give a clearer indication of the genre and give more time to Greenleaf's character and is perhaps worth a look but this adaptation, whilst occasionally lively with Damon on screen, is too muddled in ideas ","genre":null},{"date":"22 April 2009","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Tom Ripley (Damon) is sent to Italy to bring Dickie Greenleaf (Law) back to New York but soon finds himself caught up in the rich lifestyle.After his wonderful performance as Will Hunting Matt Damon found himself on the a-list and here he continues that riveting drama acting in a performance that opens in an electric and sharp manner.

There are a few things that need to happen (depending on what kind of buddy film it is), but the most important thing to have in a buddy film is chemistry. In other words, do the buddies work well with each other. Rush Hour has it, and that's why it works so well. Granted, the action is exciting and the comedy is hilarious, but Rush Hour wouldn't be as much fun as it is if Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker went together like oil and water.Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) is an LAPD detective whose ego is as big as his brain is small. When a Chinese diplomat's (Tzi Ma) daughter (Julia Hsu) is kidnapped, the diplomat wants one of his countrymen (Jackie Chan) to work with the FBI. The FBI doesn't like the idea, so they get the biggest dupe they can find to babysit the Chinese cop. Guess who they pick...The plot may be a set up for Chan's action skills and Carter's comedy (all though to be fair, they each get to do both), but the movie sticks pretty close to the plot. In general, Rush Hour switches between comedy and action, though they frequently come at the same time.Describing the film's methods would be pointless if it didn't work. But there's little (if anything) in the movie that doesn't work. Chan and Tucker work brilliantly together. While the supporting characters do good work, this movie is all about Chan and Tucker.Tucker came to fame with Friday (unseen by me), and first worked with Rush Hour director Brett Ratner in Money Talks (also unseen by me). Actually, this is the first movie I've seen him in, and I'm a fan. He's hilarious. According to IMDb, most of his lines were improvised, and if so, it worked. He never fails to get a laugh, whether big or small.Jackie Chan is a lot of fun, with his great martial arts capabilities, and his penchant for mixing it with comedy. Although Chan may be famous for his action movie skills, but he also knows how to do comedy (which is why he's frequently associated with Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin). Fortunately, director Brett Ratner understands that, and allows Chan to show this.The supporting actors are also good. Elizabeth Pena is great as the frustrated bomb squad member (who also has one of the best lines). Tom Wilkinson got his biggest break with role, and watching him here, it's no surprise why. Philip Baker Hall and the late great Chris Penn also have small roles.This isn't a classic film. It's never heavy and it NEVER takes itself seriously. It's simply a great movie to watch on a Friday night.
