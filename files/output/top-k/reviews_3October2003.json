I don't know... perhaps seeing this movie on television (as presented by the Sci-Fi Channel, infamous sanctuary of bad films and the even crappier sequels) affected my interpretation. Perhaps watching with my roommate served to skew my interpretation of a brilliant film (he couldn't stop laughing, but neither could I). Perhaps... but I really, really doubt it.Since other reviewers have written summaries of each of the film's four stories, I'll just give my impressions. The first story, as others have said, is arguably the weakest. The concept in itself isn't terrible but the execution is poor. The Evil White Cops do a good job of reinforcing the ugly stereotype that most police officers are sadistic racists out to brutalize minorities while hiding behind their badges. Despite this, the story manages to carry a nothing-new-but-I'll-watch-to-see-what-happens force... up until the climax. I am not one to dismiss a film because of dated special effects, but what takes place in the final scene looks too ridiculous to take seriously. And keep in mind the full effect was censored on the version I saw. Overall, it's pathetic and predictable. The second story is much better, owing in no small part to a surprising performance by comedian David Allen Grier that's anything but amusing. The concept behind the story is more creative than that of the previous story, and the climax is interesting if a bit predictable; as others have said, there is a distinct 'Twilight Zone' feel to the entire section. There was very little laughter as I watched this part of the movie. The laughter soon returned. The third story exploits the unfortunately socially acceptable stereotype of Racist White Southerner with an over-the-top, black-hating politician. I'll say it again special effects do NOT make a movie, but I almost laughed myself into a blackout. Whereas the second story had a 'Twilight Zone' feel, the third has a spirit more akin to the worst, least self-aware episode of 'Tales From The Crypt' imaginable. Absolutely horrible, howl-inducing stuff. Finally, the fourth story. I agree with several other reviewers that the fourth story is actually pretty good, especially when considered alongside the others- nothing glaringly wrong here. I won't say anything that might spoil the plot, but I will say that the ending was simultaneously satisfying, unsettling, and unintentionally amusing. I tried to take this section of the movie seriously, but the director made it very difficult, and the ending had on me the same effect as the ending of 'Training Day' (an EXCELLENT film, but as my friend put it, it looked like Denzel was feeling the Holy Spirit).Oh, and the framing story. Clarence Williams, III is an excellent actor and does a great job with what he's given, but the idea that three (laughably stereotypical) gangbangers looking for their drugs would sit down and listen as a creepy old guy tells them stories- it's ludicrous. Aside from Williams, the acting is terrible, and the God-awful special effects that accompany the final seconds of the movie pretty much destroy any impact that the ending may have otherwise had.I realize most people will give this a higher score because it attempts something that is conceptually sound and intriguing horror from a black point-of-view. I can't rate the movie higher than a 4 because it COULD have been great, however.My advice if you have about two hours to kill and you want to laugh at a bad-but-not-abysmal movie, 'Tales From The Hood' will not disappoint.

Only he isn't just using words, he is using an idea. What would happen if three people were given a favor and, instead of paying it back, they paid it forward? Trevor is an intelligent and caring young boy who has seen first hand that the world can be a very unkind place. When his mother, Arlene, isn't out working long hours she is home drinking her sorrows away. Trevor's father is an even worse drunk who has only taught Trevor the value of neglect and abuse. School is no picnic either, as the school bully sees little Trevor as a particularly good mark. Just when things couldn't look any worse for Trevor, something happens. While in class one day, Trevor's new teacher, Mr. Simonet, asks the class to involve themselves in a project, to find something that each of them can do to make the world a better place. While most children come up with heart felt but mostly implausible ideas, Trevor comes up with something special. What if he gave out three random favors to three individuals in need, and instead of paying him back they passed on three favors to someone else, and then those people did the same? Would it change people's lives or would the chain break shortly down the line? Eager to see his idea blossom, Trevor begins his project and thus starts a train of events with such impact that no one, not even Trevor, could have imagined its results. Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment star in the big screen adaptation of the Catherine Ryan Hyde novel, Pay it Forward. Spacey is his usual golden self as the horribly disfigured but highly intellectual schoolteacher, Eugene Simonet. Although not a tremendous character actor, Spacey does have great screen presence and is one of the kings of emotional acting, as everyone has most likely already seen in such films as Seven and The Usual Suspects. In this film his acting is so real and emotional that for a while I was calling Mr. Spacey Eugene. Helen Hunt once again graces filmgoers with her role as Trevor's troubled mom, Arlene. I don't have enough time to go over how talented Ms. Hunt is, so, as to not get caught up in repetition, I will just say that her quality acting and perfect delivery are once again displayed in this film as she plays a very real woman with very real problems. Now I usually really can't stand seeing young children in movies as lead characters because I can't stand the fact of Hollywood constantly exploiting them for their cuteness, but this Haley Joel Osment continues to baffle me. I can't understand how, at his age, Osment can be an emotional acting genius. He surprised me in Sixth Sense but in Pay it Forward he blew me away. He understands the concepts of timing and emotion, and is not used to cuten up this film but to actually take charge of it, which he does just as well as any actor far ahead of him in years. Of special mention to fans of quality acting, Frequency's Jim Caviezel turns in another brilliant performance as a homeless drug addict who is taken care of by Trevor as part of the his Pay it Forward project. To compliment the talented cast is talented director Mimi Leder, whose earlier works include the George Clooney and Nicole Kidman thriller The Peacemaker, and Morgan Freeman's Deep Impact. In Pay it Forward Leder does a near perfect job of directing a story with a lot of depth and realism. Leder keeps the flow of the film interesting and doesn't let the film get caught up in boring or uninspired dialogue, but that could be because the material and ideas she had to work with were so captivating, either way I won't complain. Leslie Dixon should also be thanked because her screenplay was intelligent and really holds your interest and won't let go. The only two gripes I had with this film were that I didn't find enough attention was paid to the actual Pay it Forward idea, and a few minutes near the film's end really downed me and threw off kilter the film's feel good aspect. My final observation on Pay it Forward is that not only is it a more than worthwhile film, it also promotes a truly inspiring and powerful message that really reminds you about the good in the world and the changes just one individual can make. Seeing this kind of message is really something everyone can enjoy so, as can be told, I would certainly recommend this film to anyone. In my humble opinion, watching this great piece of film work truly seems a favor and anyone that takes my recommendation and agrees, please don't pay me back by thanking me for telling you about it, when your done viewing just tell three friends about it and Pay it Forward.Overall Rating 8 out of 10  ","genre":null},{"date":"3 October 2003","score":"40 out of 52 people found the following review useful","review":"  Pay It Forward Everyone says they want to make the world a better place and young Trevor McKinney is no exception.

However it is vastly different from those two eg. voice-overs, black humour (throughout and very funny), the central characters are not vicious killers. However the gangsters are evil nasty characters (I love the way one practices his golf), the plot has many twists (the ending is a classic!) and various seemingly unrelated groups move inexorably closer as the end nears.

Speed 2 didn't exactly do him any favors. The older actors were also good value. Dianne Wiest was her usual reliable self while screen veteran Hermann is good value.

But if he doesn't deal with it soon, Stu will be celebrating this way forever. Stu Miley's life couldn't get any better. He has a beautiful, trusting girlfriend, Julie, whom he is going to propose to, and his popular comic strip, Monkeybone, is about to become a nationally syndicated television series. When a freak accident puts him in a coma, however, Stu's world is turned upside down as he becomes trapped in Downtown, an outrageous city of his own creation. Immediately time starts running out for Stu as he must evade Death and make it back to the world of reality before his sister pulls the plug on him, leaving him trapped in the streets of Downtown forever. To further complicate matters for Stu, his comic book creation Monkybone becomes a reality that wants to stay in reality. Stu's only hope of escape lies in the hands of a cat woman named Miss Kitty who has her own reasons for wanting Stu to stay in Downtown.  The not so talented Brendan Fraser stars as cartoon strip writer Stu Miley in the very imaginative adaptation of Kaja Blackley's comic, Dark Town. Supporting Fraser are actual Hollywood talents including Kiss of the Dragon's Bridget Fonda, as Miley's beautiful and soft spoken girlfriend, Julie; A Night at the Roxbury star Chris Kattan assumes the unusual role of the deceased and continually disemboweling athlete, Organ Donor Stu; John Turturro, sounding somewhat like his brother Nick Turturro, lends his talents as the voice for the hell raising cartoon character Monkeybone. As well, Ready to Rumble's sexy star Rose McGowan, Kids in the Hall alumni Dave Foley, and Whoppi Goldberg are just some of the other notable names to mention in a film boasting a great cast, Brendan Fraser excluded. Director Henry Selick uses the same fresh and imaginative style he used in The Nightmare Before Christmas to make this film very pleasing on the eyes, however its immature humor is not so pleasing on the head. Trying to cop cheap feels doesn't make me laugh the way it used to. Don't get me wrong though, I still don't mind some crude sexual humor, such as in American Pie, but that was because the jokes in that film required delivery and actual humor, and not just a character with an innuendo for a name. I must admit though, some scenes involving Chris Kattan near the film's end are disturbingly humorous. Writer Sam Hamm does a good job in helping to keep the story imaginative, but the film's producers, Mark Radcliffe and Michael Barnathan, didn't seem to be as helpful, due to the fact that some of the scenes had seemingly cheap set design, such is the case with Fraser's roller coaster ride. However, they did seem to put some good money into wardrobe, as the costumes and make-up, especially McGowan's, are well done and fit the film's imagination.  Monkeybone is by no means a classic, and it does happen to star Brendan Fraser, but the great supporting players, the bold and imaginative look, and a genuinely unpredictable ending, make this film, in my opinion, something better than your average Blockbuster rental. So if your feeling a little bored and need some entertainment, just grab Monkeybone.Overall Rating 7 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 October 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Monkeybone Being trapped in Downtown, eluding Death, and spending the rest of his time defending himself from the antics of a cartoon monkey, was not the way Stu Miley had planned on celebrating his hit cartoon strip becoming a nationally syndicated television show.

One has become a well-known Rabbi the other a respected Priest. They are both faithful to each other and to their respective religions. But when another childhood friend Anna walks back in to their lives, keeping the faith takes a back seat to winning her love. Jake, Brian and Anna were childhood friends who shared everything together until Anna and her family moved away from New York. Although feeling incomplete without Anna, Jake and Brian remained and grew up as friends. Along the way Jake chooses the way of the rabbi and Brian the way of the priest. With their faith strong and their friendship equally as strong, the two friends find there isn't an obstacle they can't overcome. But when Anna suddenly comes back in to there lives a beautiful and vibrant woman, both Jake and Brian fall for her, leaving them to test the strength of their friendship and the limits of their beliefs. Ben Stiller, Edward Norton and Jenna Elfman star in Edward Norton's directorial debut Keeping the Faith. Once again Zoolander star Stiller showcases the reasons he is becoming Hollywood's fastest rising funnyman. His facial expressions are comedic enough without his dialogue being delivered perfectly, but Stiller seems to want to deliver perfectly anyway, giving his character, Jake, more personality than your average romantic comedy character. Edward Norton is surprisingly funny in this film as the heartbroken priest, Brian, whose faith is seriously tested because of his want for Anna, who is of course being played by Dharma and Greg's sassy star Jenna Elfman. Elfman is great fun in this movie with no surprise, as she uses the same wit and charm that has made her television show such a success. She seems to have no problem keeping up with Stiller's hilarity and Norton's intelligence, making her another perfect choice in a film where all three of the leads show how easy a movie can be carried with a little chemistry. For his first time Ed Norton didn't direct anything extravagant, but he did craft a smart and touching romantic comedy with its good share of funny moments. Stiller's confrontations with T- Bone (Brian Anthony Wilson) are classic, as well the scene with Don (Ken Leung) belting out `Jesse's Girl' had me in an uproar for almost two minutes. Norton uses subtle visual humor, like the Rabbi trading cards, effectively to help keep a smile on the viewers face while they pass the film's dull moments, and while they deal with the fact that the film runs about half an hour too long. Yet Norton must be again credited for allowing writer Stuart Bumberg's characters a chance to really develop themselves on screen, which not a lot of directors seem to like to do anymore. Norton and Hawk Koch slightly overproduce this film, but it still looks good and the emotions are captured very well. All criticism aside it's nice to see Ed Norton bring to the table something fresh and intelligent to a genre I had almost given up on because of it being so bogged down in cliché and bad dialogue. So if you're feeling like I was, and are losing all hope in romantic comedies, just remember to be strong and try Keeping the Faith.Overall Rating 7.5 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 October 2003","score":"","review":"  Keeping the Faith Jake and Brian have been best friends since childhood.

This is the first and only Bond movie that's only about a personal revenge from Bond.The movie is also more cruel and darker compared to other Bond's. Unfortunately that also means that there is not the same amount of humor that we are used to in a Bond movie. But that's not really a bad thing, just try to see this movie as an individual instead of a part of the Bond series.There are some really great characters. As always especially the villains. Robert Davi plays one of my favorite Bond villains and a very young and at that time still unknown Benicio Del Toro plays an awesome psychopathic killer, he actually is scary. Wonderful casting! I also like the character of Q in this one, his character also seems more humane and I love the way the movie shows the special kind of friendship Bond and Q have.The movie misses the special kind of Bond feeling but is very awesome on his own nevertheless.

It's one of the best pure fantasies ever to hit the big screen, a capable retelling of the Arthur legend and, at times, a thrilling piece of cinema one is eager to share with friends.The problem is the story is too big to contain the film, even one as grand and epic in its reach (or overreach) as this. To focus more attention on a particular aspect might have left people wondering about the rest, but would have provided some needed plot discipline and encouraged the viewer to empathize with the characters rather than simply enjoy them. Even reading John Steinbeck's Acts Of King Arthur And His Noble Knights, itself a radically compressed account of Morte d'Arthur by Sir Thomas Malory, is to get a sense of the many verdant nooks and crannies left unexplored by necessity in this film. Like the fact Merlin's fate is sealed not by Morgana, but Nyneve, another sorceress of decidedly different character than her rival Morgana. Or how Arthur's subjugation of his realm involves years of hard fighting and diplomacy with friends and enemies alike.I could have done without the business of the Grail. It's a vital piece of the total Arthurian legend, mind, but it slows down things and calls attention to the shaky balancing act Boorman is purposely performing between the legend's pagan roots and its Christian dressings. I think Christianity is a vital part of the Camelot story, but Boorman sidesteps it effectively enough here I would have been content to let that part slip by. As it is, the Grail thing comes out of left field and distracts us too much from the main story just as it reaches its denouement.But so much else is good about this film. The brooding, fog-choked moors imbued with the green light of renewal and hope, the clunky battles of armor-bedecked maniacs, the gorgeous bodices on fair maidens that seem to ache for the ripping, and the sense of wonderment and possibility around every corner, especially when Merlin's about. Sheer magic.For those who only know Arthur from Bugs Bunny or Monty Python, this is a great place to start learning more. The film's best performance, as so many note here, is Nicol Williamson's Merlin. He growls his best lines in such a way to bestow them with both humor and authority, and uses his eyes the same way another necromancer would a wand. He's above the people who operate around them, he's not human at all, yet in a strange way he is, as Boorman and Williamson capture him.The other actors are quite fine, though keeping track of them all seems more a function of traffic management than true directing. It's early days in the careers of Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart, and Gabriel Byrne, and they give solid if not spine-tingling performances. Maybe they were less eager performers when they realized they had second billing to the likes of Nigel Terry, Cherie Lunghi, Paul Geoffrey, and the late Nicholas Clay. All four are good, by the way, and Lunghi particularly shines with her beauty and charm, but it's not a surprise none really developed major recognition beyond their roles here, at least on this side of the Atlantic. They are serviceable, at times brilliant, but never compelling.Finally, Boorman is one of the most puzzling directors around, perhaps by design. What can you say about a director who has two of the worst films ever made on his résumé, Zardoz and Exorcist II, and yet remains a compelling filmmaker over four decades? His visual sense is so unique, powerful, and uncompromising that he is forgiven faults that would sink the careers of lesser artists, or even just less headstrong ones. He's an impossible eccentric, and I get the feeling from watching him here and elsewhere that his dream project would involve having his immediate family strut up and down the screen stark naked for 90 minutes, but Excalibur shows the method behind the madness, and justifies the excess.

So Julio Medem takes this complicated formula one step - or more - further and comes up with a somewhat lop-sided involuted story, which, if you like, might be classified as a love story, or, if you like not, might be classified as a sex story. In either case you would be missing the point.As with `Los Amantes del Círculo Polar' (qv), Julio Medem opts for seemingly disjointed narrative, jumping back and forth, but not in a two-dimensional sense, but rather in an umpteen-dimensional sense. Thus he carries to the nth degree erratic manoeuvres between the now and the then and other intermediary points, such that if the explicit sex has not put off your concentration too much you might well follow what is, in effect, an intriguing story, with all its bizarre ennui attached. Once again, linking up the out-of-sequence scenes is not for those more intent on finishing off their pop-corn or wondering whether the boyfriend\/girlfriend is going to hold her\/his hand before the film gets too far on.Bringing together Paz Vega, Elena Anaya and Javier Cámara so that they would be ready for `Hable con Ella' (qv) and adding Najwa Nimri after her excellent results in `Los Amantes del Círculo Polar', Medem throws into the mix Tristán Ulloa and conjures up a horrifyingly painful story of glorious love and frenzied sex. But I insist that the sexual inferences are not the point but only the vehicle for carrying the story forward - with its overly frequent jumps backward - so that all the ends can be neatly tied up, or apparently so, so as to reach what is, in the last few minutes, the foreseeable happy ending. The whole point of the film is, as far as I am aware, to portray the young modern woman today who wants - craves - her bit of good sex as much as any man does, and we do not need served-up macho interpretations to be convinced of it. Evidently, Medem, as Almodóvar, has a good hand with the ladies, and this film puts such asseveration beyond doubt. What I question is whether such blatantly explicit sex scenes were necessary for getting the point across, especially as it would seem that Medem is aiming at audiences whose intellectual appetite is somewhat higher than `Notting Hill', say, or `You've got Mail', say. Such supposed audience would or should have enough imagination to carry him\/her through such scenes. But today everything is served up straight, on a plate, and dished out accordingly, symptomatic of today's idealistic `unique thinking'.But Medem defies such straight-jacket ways of doing things. As in `Los Amantes del Círculo Polar', here what might be called happenstance or fortuitous casualties, brings together a number of people on the Balearic island of Formentera, in such a way that the link up between them should help you along through the out-of-sequence scenes. The symbolic thread is the moon - thus the little girl is called 'Luna'. Medem uses this concept very appropriately, creating dialogues to carry forward the idea and putting visual images into great use so as to help the story-line along. Perfectly orchestrated by Alberto Iglesias, in consonance with Kiko de la Rica's excellent photography, the whole is rather like a choreographed tableau, as if only the skates and ice were missing.I recommend this film for viewers who can grasp the essentials of abstract, sometimes fantasious symbolisms and has a clear mind on the rôle of primeval sex as a driving force in women - as well as men.

Perfectly orchestrated by Alberto Iglesias, in consonance with Kiko de la Rica's excellent photography, the whole is rather like a choreographed tableau, as if only the skates and ice were missing.I recommend this film for viewers who can grasp the essentials of abstract, sometimes fantasious symbolisms and has a clear mind on the rôle of primeval sex as a driving force in women - as well as men.

So Julio Medem takes this complicated formula one step - or more - further and comes up with a somewhat lop-sided involuted story, which, if you like, might be classified as a love story, or, if you like not, might be classified as a sex story. In either case you would be missing the point.As with `Los Amantes del Círculo Polar' (qv), Julio Medem opts for seemingly disjointed narrative, jumping back and forth, but not in a two-dimensional sense, but rather in an umpteen-dimensional sense. Thus he carries to the nth degree erratic manoeuvres between the now and the then and other intermediary points, such that if the explicit sex has not put off your concentration too much you might well follow what is, in effect, an intriguing story, with all its bizarre ennui attached. Once again, linking up the out-of-sequence scenes is not for those more intent on finishing off their pop-corn or wondering whether the boyfriend\/girlfriend is going to hold her\/his hand before the film gets too far on.Bringing together Paz Vega, Elena Anaya and Javier Cámara so that they would be ready for `Hable con Ella' (qv) and adding Najwa Nimri after her excellent results in `Los Amantes del Círculo Polar', Medem throws into the mix Tristán Ulloa and conjures up a horrifyingly painful story of glorious love and frenzied sex. But I insist that the sexual inferences are not the point but only the vehicle for carrying the story forward - with its overly frequent jumps backward - so that all the ends can be neatly tied up, or apparently so, so as to reach what is, in the last few minutes, the foreseeable happy ending. The whole point of the film is, as far as I am aware, to portray the young modern woman today who wants - craves - her bit of good sex as much as any man does, and we do not need served-up macho interpretations to be convinced of it. Evidently, Medem, as Almodóvar, has a good hand with the ladies, and this film puts such asseveration beyond doubt. What I question is whether such blatantly explicit sex scenes were necessary for getting the point across, especially as it would seem that Medem is aiming at audiences whose intellectual appetite is somewhat higher than `Notting Hill', say, or `You've got Mail', say. Such supposed audience would or should have enough imagination to carry him\/her through such scenes. But today everything is served up straight, on a plate, and dished out accordingly, symptomatic of today's idealistic `unique thinking'.But Medem defies such straight-jacket ways of doing things. As in `Los Amantes del Círculo Polar', here what might be called happenstance or fortuitous casualties, brings together a number of people on the Balearic island of Formentera, in such a way that the link up between them should help you along through the out-of-sequence scenes. The symbolic thread is the moon - thus the little girl is called 'Luna'. Medem uses this concept very appropriately, creating dialogues to carry forward the idea and putting visual images into great use so as to help the story-line along.
