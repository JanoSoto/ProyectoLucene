[{"date":"15 March 2001","score":"","review":"  Rushmore (R) is a fable about a precocious teenager at an expensive private school who falls in love with one of his teachers;  I loved this film from frame one because it is so funny, heartbreaking, astonishing;  acting, all the technical stuff (cinematography, casting, etc.) is excellent, the soundtrack is outstanding -- I had not thought of Lennon's Oh Yoko as a great song before, but here it knocked me off my seat.HOWEVER, there will be some, maybe even a lot of people who will not like R;  they will say that it is unfunny, unrealistic and unengaging, that they could not relate to it.  With this movie I can accept that, and I would not accuse them of being humourless or missing the point, either.  Though it does not detract from its qualities, it simply is not a film for everybody.  The humour is not necessarily intellectual or alternative or subtle, but it is not mainstream or Tom Green either.  Some people will look for a realistic high school story, or a realistic falling - in - love - with - the - wrong - person tale, which R is not.  I think that if I would attempt to describe what this movie is about, whether it is a funny movie with a great story or vice versa, I would end up with endless pages of cinema babble.  Instead, my advice to you is simply  take a risk, go see for yourself, it will be worth your while.
