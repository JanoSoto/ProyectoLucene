The consequences of his actions, both on his family and himself, are devastating. Evidently, some people have taken offense at the idea that he is also a real human being, capable of remorse and grief. By not turning him into a non-human monster, and by forcing the audience to get inside his head, his actions become more terrible, and more reprehensible, not less so. No, this is not the daring thing about this movie. The real daring aspect of the movie is that Solondz takes characters whose lives are desperately out-of-control, whose actions are outrageously shocking, and he makes a COMEDY out of it. The movie succeeds because it is indeed funny, at times hilarious, and yet it does not take its subjects or its characters at all lightly. All of the characters seem very real, which makes their actions all the more shocking. The movie forces us to see the story from each character's point of view, even if that point of view is odd or shocking. The music, rather than intensify our emotional response, shows us the character's own internal feelings. For example, when Bill Maplewood sees his son's friend at a ballgame, the scene is shot as if it were a love scene, complete with slow motion and sweeping, romantic music. This is, of course, the way Bill himself would have felt at the time. By shooting the scene in this way, the viewer is forced inside Bill's head. Since Bill's object of desire is an eleven year old boy, the scene becomes sickeningly ironic. The scene is much more effective and in fact more horrifying than if it had been shot in typical Hollywood style, complete with scary horror-film music. My only complaints about the movie are the subplot involving Kristina (Camryn Manheim), which seems to have been added only for its sick humor value, and the last scene. The last scene seems to be entirely designed to gross out and shock the audience. It is an unsatisfying ending to a movie which is not just trying to shock us, but instead trying to show us the dark, unseen, and all-too-true corners of American life.

The lights breaking, fireworks in the air. But that's just one of the great moments in this movie. You would think that after watching so many sports movies, the little tricks would present themselves. Not in the Natural. Every shot, every scene is so well-lit, well accompanied by Randy Newman's score, and so darn well acted by Robert Redford, that everything works. I've been a semi-Redford fan all my life, but I must say that this one is one of his very best. He gives the character a depth that many others couldn't, without him, Roy Hobbs might have been a caricature, a goody-goody. Instead, he gives Roy a youthful force in the beginning of the movie, and after a pivotal moment, we see the age he has accumulated, the weight of his dying dream hanging firm to his shoulder. We see an actual change in him. For the worse. But we still see that grin, that grin not only brings back the youthful Roy we saw in the beginning, but it awakens the young Roy we all have inside. The scene I will remember most is not the ending, that's incredible enough, its a scene in the middle, one that might have gotten lost but Levinson the director, not one to ignore the small scenes that make up a story, films it in a way that keeps you in the right frame of mind. The scene is when the manager lets Roy play. It takes place in the tunnel to the clubhouse, and Levinson doesn't light it at all, its taken in a darkness, the only light at the end of the tunnel. but at the right moment we cut to a close shot of Roy reacting to the news he can play. This shot is filmed with bright light on his face, a sharp change from the shot before. This light makes Roy's face shine, and I don't believe anyone can dispute that they didn't get a little thrill out of that scene. All in all a masterful performance by all involved (including Robert Duvall in a nice neat role, and Glenn Close, the woman in white, Kim Basinger is also good). I highly recomend.

His last films had not been well welcomed, but he is redeemed with Ronin. The scenes of car chases,on the streets of Nice, are terrific and they deserve to enter in the action film's canons. The edition and the assembly get to reach a primacy that until then belonged to another film, Bullit (1968), with Steve McQueen. The cars really run furiously on the streets, and at this time, the persecution becomes hair-raising, being impossible to the people watching accompany that without an accelerated heart!in Ronin, the accident's scenes are real and strong, and the film doesn't make concessions the characters are shown leaving the wreckages, with blood dispersed around their bodies, and the rain falling strongly.The perfection with which the action scenes were accomplished deserves to be checked, besides in the shooting moments in Nice's streets, with Sam and his friends holding the machine guns and trying to take possession of of the stranger's handbag. There is a particularly violent scene, in which Jonathan Pryce's character,Seamus,beats a partner who had betrayed him. While Pryce beats the man, Natascha McElhone's character,Deirdre,is calm and relaxed, without doing anything to help, listening to the man being massacred.Another exciting moment is the climax, in a stadium full of people, in which Sam confronts the Russian Mob and the character of Pryce.Ronin comes out well, counting with a lot of qualities, especially for studying, for developing its characters, accentuating the psychological aspects, that are exposed with the violence of their acts. Thus, Ronin is a great film, that deserves to be seen!

In 1997,director James Mangold filmed a touching and exciting masterpiece, Cop Land, that,as the protagonist,had a fat, aged, melancholic and suitable Sylvester Stallone. And it is starting from Sylvester Stallone's character, sheriff Freddie Heflin, that we notice that Cop Land will talk about blame, pain and sadness, about the fears that haunt us, and the hard road which takes to reach the redemption, when showing a man's fight,a person who needs to look for forces inside of himself and to face the latent corruption which dominates the small city of Garrison.Deaf of a heard and sad, Heflin spent all his life in Garrison, and he saw the woman he loved most (and for whom he lost the audition, when trying to save her from a car accident) get married with another policeman. Counting with a great cast,that includes Harvey Keitel (as Ray Dolan, a corrupt and evil cop), Ray Liotta (as Gary Figgs, the partner and friend of Heflin), Robert De Niro (as Moe Tilden, an Internal Affairs 's tough agent who is obstinate to end with the corruption that dominates the city of Garrison) and many others, Cop Land is a dramatic, psychological and touching thriller.Garrison seems to be a safe and ideal city everybody knows each other, and most of its inhabitants are cops. Cop Land counts with a expert and efficient direction, that knows how to balance the moments of tension, drama and action well.Even sinning for its slow rhythm, Cop Land is already one of the best and biggest crime- drama ever filmed. Stallone has in Freddie Heflin the chance of showing his talent. Heflin is very similar to Rocky, because both are innocent, but they see each other in situations in that they need to face their deepest fears and to win in the end... Touching and redeemer, Cop Land is a film that deserves to be seen, for its exceptional performances, for its interesting and touching story and for being a quality entertainment, with an excellent production.
