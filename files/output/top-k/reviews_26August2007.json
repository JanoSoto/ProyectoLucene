So of course I remember watching Grease since I was a little girl, while it was never my favorite musical or story, it does still hold a little special place in my heart since it's still a lot of fun to watch. I heard horrible things about Grease 2 and that's why I decided to never watch it, but my boyfriend said that it really wasn't all that bad and my friend agreed, so I decided to give it a shot, but I called them up and just laughed. First off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it wasn't really clever, not to mention they just used the same characters, but with different names and actors. Tell me, how did the Pink Ladies and T-Birds continue years on after the former gangs left? Not to mention the creator face motor cycle enemy, gee, what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these T-Birds were just stupid and ridiculous.Another year at Rydell and the music and dancing hasn't stopped. But when a new student who is Sandy's cousin comes into the scene, he is love struck by a pink lady, Stephanie. But she must stick to the code where only Pink Ladies must stick with the T-Birds, so the new student, decides to train as a T-Bird to win her heart. So he dresses up as a rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat the evil bikers from easily kicking the T-Bird's butts. But will he tell Stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own? Well, find out for yourself.Grease 2 is like a silly TV show of some sort that didn't work. The gang didn't click as well as the first Grease did, not to mention Frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable, because I thought that she graduated from Rydell, but apparently she didn't. The songs were not really that catchy; I'm glad that Michelle was able to bounce back so fast, but that's probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel, I wouldn't really recommend this film, other than if you are curious, but I warned you, this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musical.2\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 August 2007","score":"10 out of 18 people found the following review useful","review":" Well, at least my theater group did, lol.

The story and story-telling was ridicules, the flow was just off and I didn't liked were the movie was heading to and it made me tired watching it, since it made such an absolutely pointless impression.The story is just bad since its hard to believe. Guess these sort of things really happen in the world but it just doesn't ever get believable in the movie, mostly because of the reason that it just never gets interesting. Which character are we supposed to sympathize for? The Kate Winslet one? I don't think so, since she plays a brainwashed, manipulative character, who turned her cheek to her family and 'normal' way of life. The Harvey Keitel one then? No, really not. He's a character that sleeps and slaps around and cheats on his wife.The editing is a reason why the movie just never flows and makes the movie feel incoherent. Also the cinematography makes some odd choices at times. To me some of the shots even seemed amateur like. Weird, since Dion Beebe is an one time Oscar winner- and nominee, so perhaps simply blame the director? Further more the movie uses slow-motion at the oddest times, so that it becomes laughable, instead of effective.The movie gets all the more weird from the moment Harvey Keitel starts to wear a dress. How can you take anything else that's happening after that serious? You can say that the comedy goes at the expense of the drama but this also is vice versa the case. Guess this movie will also be remembered as the one with Harvey Keitel walking in the Australian desert, with full make-up on and in a dress.All of the family characters are supposed to be humorous and a wild bunch of crazy people but their all so horribly stereotypical that this just never works out. All of the actors portraying them also seem to be non-actors, which could had worked for the realism but simply doesn't because of the reason that they were supposed to be comical. Some of the dialog and moments are supposed to be humorous but they all feel awkward. It's almost embarrassing to watch. The endless talking about nothing between the Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel also don't help to make this movie the most interesting or fast going movies. Just think about it, what gets achieved in this movie? Absolutely nothing and therefor the movie is a totally pointless and redundant one. It tries to go deep but it seems to afraid to ever push really through.No offense or anything but by just looking at this movie you can tell it was directed by a woman. It's just too obvious all. It features lots of dancing and jumping around, sincere and realistic emotions, kissing around and all the male characters have all the usual stereotypical element in them (of which most are true of course). All the men are pigs, who love to drink, try to hide their emotions, slap around and all they try is to get in a woman's pants. The movie is also filled with lots off elements that I suppose are part of female sexual fantasies. All of the sex and love in this movie seems to be focused purely in a way women want it to be. Nothing wrong with that all of course but it just doesn't work for a mainstream movie, with also big name actors in it. After you've already been nominated and have won an Oscar (both for The Piano), you just can't expect from people to take your further work as anything small- and without ambitious intentions.Without Harvey Keitel in it, I would had probably never finished watching this movie. He's a great actor that is great in his role and helps to keep the movie going. And well Kate Winslet, I just never have been really a fan of hers, although she certainly has qualities as an actress. Pam Grier plays a far too small role in this movie. They should had made her role bigger, to provide the movie at least with one more good and interesting character.

It's the type of movie that touches your heart and makes you laugh good. My main objective to discuss here was that Robin Williams had done such an amazing job; every time I watch this movie and get to the part where Mrs. Doubtfire enters through the door of Miranda Hillard, I always forget that it is Miranda's husband Daniel Hillard underneath that disguise but maybe in fact a real Mrs. Doubtfire. I always look at the old woman as though if she were a real Mrs. Doubtfire, because the acting is just so convincing and so real. I love the old lady, Mrs. Doubtfire! It only shows how desperate a father can be to see his own children, and most importantly shows that he loves his children that much and cannot live without them. I thought it was incredibly sweet in the end for Miranda to talk to the judge and have all those legal conditions for Daniel taken off his shoulders in order to see his children. I love Daniel and Mrs. Doubtfire's characters, because those are the kind of great people children need for emotional and inspirational guidance. Mrs. Doubtfire brought out the best in that whole family when really it was Daniel Hillard who had done that! That was to prove that Daniel was way much a better man and a better husband and father, and he had greatly proved that to Miranda and his three children. I also wanted to add that when Daniel calls his ex-wife, using all those fake voices pretending to be those fake, non-existent, make-believe people, his voices all sounded too very much the same, and Miranda could have easily recognized that all those voices sounded too similar and that in fact it could have really been her ex-husband. Also, Miranda's reaction frightened me a bit when she found out that it was her ex-husband pretending to be Mrs. Doubtfire the whole time. This movie is emotional, funny, outstanding, and an excellent job well done! Robin Williams has great, funny talent!

It only shows how desperate a father can be to see his own children, and most importantly shows that he loves his children that much and cannot live without them. I thought it was incredibly sweet in the end for Miranda to talk to the judge and have all those legal conditions for Daniel taken off his shoulders in order to see his children. I love Daniel and Mrs. Doubtfire's characters, because those are the kind of great people children need for emotional and inspirational guidance. Mrs. Doubtfire brought out the best in that whole family when really it was Daniel Hillard who had done that! That was to prove that Daniel was way much a better man and a better husband and father, and he had greatly proved that to Miranda and his three children. I also wanted to add that when Daniel calls his ex-wife, using all those fake voices pretending to be those fake, non-existent, make-believe people, his voices all sounded too very much the same, and Miranda could have easily recognized that all those voices sounded too similar and that in fact it could have really been her ex-husband. Also, Miranda's reaction frightened me a bit when she found out that it was her ex-husband pretending to be Mrs. Doubtfire the whole time. This movie is emotional, funny, outstanding, and an excellent job well done! Robin Williams has great, funny talent!

She threatens the three that she will go to the principal about it, but he's not available. So before she reports it the next morning. Leigh, her friend Jo Lynn and Scott head to her place that night and try to convince her not tell the principal. However due to Tingle's stubbornness, that find themselves reverting to drastic measures to stop this getting out.Wasn't fan of it when I first saw it, and after another viewing, I'm still not one. Writer Kevin Williamson was on a roll after penning the successful contemporary teen horror films; 'Scream (1996)', 'I Know What You did Last Summer (1997)', 'Scream 2 (1997)' and 'The Faculty (1998)'. He was riding the success (also not to forget the TV show 'Dawson's Creek), but this project would be the final bump. The difference there, compared with this entry was other then writing the screenplay, he was also making his debut in directing. The strange thing though, was that I found his direction to be competently done, but material he stormed up to flavourless and tired. It seemed to get caught in playing both a black comedy and straight-out thriller, without making it gel. The script is cluttered with quick-wit, on-going gags, trivial stretches and gimmicky references towards other films, but the problem is that it's too watered-down with so many contrived developments and sappy moral currents disrupting the flow. The fractured script had to be more strong and potent, since it's a small-scale production that feels like you're watching a stage show because of its mostly confined sets. It tries to play mind games with the characters, but these moments are there to only serve the story's poor progression into a puddle of stupidity and senselessness. The film's ending takes the cake. Williamson's polished direction is sound, but more so in a pedestrian way and therefore it lacks suspense and the pacing even with its taut surroundings can really plod on. You eventually feel it after the halfway mark, and it shows up how minor the story is. The performances are tolerable enough, although if it weren't for Helen Mirren's classy, icy portrayal of manipulative prowess as Mrs. Tingle and a buoyant Marisa Coughlan, we would have been stuck watching a vapid goody-to-shoes Katie Holmes. Barry Watson is modest in his slacker part and Molly Ringwald has a lesser role. The soundtrack packs enough energy, but I found it terribly overwrought and shapeless in its choices.Watchable, but mechanical all round.

A much scarier Jason than the sack-head from Part 2. How he gets it you'll have to watch and see for yourself...OK, Part 3 starts off showing the last scene from Part 2 to get us caught back up on the action. From that we are introduced to a couple who own a small store that is built in with their house. Also it appears that the woman owns the man as well, as she is very cranky and complaining about him. We kind of feel sorry for the guy, but we want Jason to shut that B***h up! Well, we know what happens to story-filling actors, so let's move on to the naive teens down on the farm...Horrible acting here. This is what sets this film back from Part 2. I wanted to like the characters, but the only two I really could say that I liked was Shelly and Chris. And it wasn't really their acting (because like I said, the acting was pitiful), but I liked the characters. Shelly was the curly-headed guy that played all the horrible jokes that everyone else seemed to hate (but I liked them). And of course Chris was our heroine. Another thing the film fails to do is catch us up on what happened to Chris when her parents found her. We basically had to fill in our own thoughts there. She was attacked by a man in the woods. Well, yeah...Jason obviously, and that becomes apparent when she sees his face again near the end of the movie and says, It's you! It can't be! You're dead! ...or something like that. One scene I found funny was when Chris was hiding in the closet upstairs, and after Jason chopped at the door with an ax, she came at him with the knife slashing and stabbing him in the leg...Jason grunted and moaned! The biker gang could have been a nice touch if they would have been used a little differently. But then again, story-filling actors play story-filling roles... And Rick the hick, I wanted him dead from the moment his character was introduced! Oh, and the scene near the end with Mrs. Voorhees coming out of the water, IMO, was either just a dream Chris was having, or it was to pay homage to the original Friday the 13th when Jason did the same thing at the end of it.All in all, this is one of the weaker films in the series thanks to some horrific acting and bad characters.

Jet Li seeks revenge for his dead brother and falls in love with the daughter of the man who may or may not be responsible. Jet Li actually shows some acting potential, as does Aaliyah. Sadly this was her first and last film.There you go. You've got a good story and decent acting. That means this Jet Li movie is going to rule, right? Wrong! Apparently they traded in the quality of plot and acting for the quality of action. Jet Li has proved his ground-based abilities in the martial arts in fantastic movies like the Shaolin Temple 3 and Fist of Legend. So why, I must ask, does Jet Li have to be hanging on wires all the time? I like to see what Jet can really do. When they hang him upside down by one foot and chain his hands, and he still whips several guards, that's fake. When suddenly the movie goes in slow motion, Jet floats in the air, and kicks 9 guys circling him almost simultaneously super fast, that's fake.I laughed during the football fight scene. They can't even make the wire-work look a little realistic. He's floating over everyone and hovering. I will say the scene where Jet can't hit a girl, so he grabs Aaliyah and uses her as a weapon was pretty good, and cool. The fight scene outside her house was also okay, because it only had a few wires. Other than that, poor choreography and too many wires ruin the action. The final fight was actually on the verge of being good, but then of course in the last 15 seconds they to pump it up with several wires. I hate meaningless wire-fu with a passion, particularly when there's this much of it.For once the reason to watch a Jet Li movie is reversed. Watch for the storyline, not necessarily the fight scenes. Unless you love wire-fu, then you will probably love this film. Had they simply made better action scenes I'd give this an 8 or so. But as disappointed as I am with the action I give this a 5\/10.

All the characters are given a heart in this film to some degree and have very distinguishable features.There are very little western movies that lock me to my seat but this was definitely one of them. From epic one liners like Henry Fondas How am I suppose to trust a man who can't even trust his pants. said to a man who has both suspenders and a belt connected to his pants. To Charles Brosnon saying Can you play music with that too. sliding the revolver down the bar towards Harmonica.The movie was one of the best western flicks of all time. It was entirely underrated and anyone who remotely likes western flicks would be left in the dust if they hadn't seen this one. ","genre":"Western"}]
