The postcards are a great example. I've never heard of this movie before watching it in my Film Study class. I thought it was really creative when Altman used the popular actors in show business to act as themselves. I also found it interesting that Bruce Willis played his little minor part for free. Altman does a really great job at showing the ups and downs of show business. The nice cars and money are examples of the ups of show business and then the threatening postcards and non stop phone calls for pitches and also unbalanced relationships with people are the downs.This is definitely a movie i would probably watch in the future when kickin back. I haven't seen many movies that have really given you a walk through a persons life thats involved with show business. An average person thinks Hollywood and movies are all fun and all about being rich and partying.

Like Se7en and Fight Club, The Game contains a shocking twist near the end that forces you to reevaluate the entire movie. Many viewers don't like the twist (as can be seen from some of the comments here), contending that it makes the whole film a waste of time. They may have a point, but I can't say I agree with them. In a way, The Game is a descendant of The Wizard of Oz and A Christmas Carol in that what happens is essentially a dream that is still important though none of it really happened, because of how the dream affects the main character.The Game began life as a spec script that reputedly floated around Hollywood for years, well-respected as a piece of work but considered unfilmable. Enter David Fincher, who has made a career of filming the difficult, the outrageous, and the provocative.Michael Douglas gives a brilliant performance as Nicholas Van Orton. In a way, this seems to be the role he was born to play. Only Gordon Gekko rivals this character in Douglas's career. Part of the problem with Douglas is that you tend to get the same performance, the same persona every time out, and Nicholas is almost type-casting. But this movie asks Douglas to go a little farther than I've ever seen him go. He finds real levels of panic and desperation in his performance here that are fascinating coming from such a normally controlled actor.This movie is basically about the humiliation and degradation of Nicholas Van Orton, breaking him down and stripping him to nothing in order that he can build again from a solid foundation. As a result, although the movie for the most part plays very seriously as a tense thriller, on repeat viewings one can perceive a wicked streak of black humor running through almost every scene. Many of Douglas's moments in the film are extremely, though subtly, humorous -- such as when he's talking to the two new members at his club about the game; he perfectly conveys both the fear of embarrassment and secret interest that Nicholas is feeling. Or the look on his face as the runaway taxi is about to crash into the bay (with him in it), or when machine gun fire suddenly rakes the window behind him at Christine's apartment.The things CRS does to Nicholas are both hilarious and disturbing. He is very much a Scrooge character at the beginning of the movie -- cold and isolated, mean and unhappy. One set piece after another humiliates, unnerves, and ultimately terrifies him, until he has no control left over what used to be his life, and finally he can take action with no thought for consequences.Perhaps what is most disappointing about the ending for many viewers is that Nicholas ultimately loses the game -- CRS drives him to commit suicide (or so he believes), and he only survives because they have arranged for him to survive. In a strong parallel to Se7en, the protagonists in both movies remain at the mercy of their antagonists (John Doe and CRS) until the bitter end, after the point at which, in an ordinary Hollywood movie, they would have successfully fought back and regained control. Ultimately, what CRS does to Nicholas is destroy his life, take everything from him, make him think he killed his own brother, and then -- give it all back to him. In the process, he does learn to be more engaged, learns that money is not what really matters in life.It's a hard movie to get a handle on, and that's what I love about it. One aspect I'm not crazy about is that only a very rich person could afford the benefits of the game. But maybe a less expensive game could be tailored for a less wealthy person. And besides, part of the point seems to be that Nicholas was such a jerk at the beginning, he deserved to be treated this way. And maybe all wealthy corporate titans like Nicholas deserve to find out what it's like to lose everything.As usual, in this movie Fincher moves the camera (and the objects and people being filmed) with the grace and kinetic energy of the young Spielberg, composes the frame with the beauty and attention to detail of Kubrick, and stages action and generates gut-wrenching suspense like Jimmy Cameron. Fincher's movies are always pervaded with a deep, penetrating intelligence. Everything here is thought out to the finest detail, and all aspects of the production, from sets to costumes to music to (of course) cinematography and editing are flawless. The supporting performances (and everyone here other than Douglas is really in a supporting role) are all outstanding.

I've have never saw a movie like this before, so it was fun to watch and figure things out. It had a lot of different techniques to show you what was going on in the movie, instead of just saying words and telling you what was going on. The plot of the movie is for Indiana Jones to find is father. His father disappeared while looking for the Holy Grail, so Indiana is willing to go and find him. Once he was found, the relationship between the two was very strange. They did not seem to get along with each other, because they did not agree on anything. The setting of the movie fit very well with the movie. The scenery made you feel like it was set back in the olden days, which made the story more realistic. It also made it seem more adventurous, by using older weapons. They did this, because technology was not used as much then, so it gave it an older look. For the most part, this movie is told from Indiana Jones point of view. The character are of course a major part of the move. The main character in this film was Indiana Jones. He was represented by a wipe and a hat. A big thing that I noticed in this movie was the sounds techniques. If something was going wrong, bad sounding music would always play. But when Indiana was doing something good, his theme song would begin to play. The music set the stage for what was about to happen in that certain scene. Lighting was used to help set the scene and help you to focus on certain things on the set. They also used lighting in the movie for a lot of shadowed objects. Many camera techniques were also used in this film. They consisted of framing, panning, and juxtaposition. This made you focus on the important things and kept your attention on what was going on at the time of the movie. The end of the movie surprised me, when his father told him to forget the Holy Grail. It was a major curve of the movie that I did not except and was not ready for. This was a good movie to watch, and I was very impressed how it was made and produced.

They are all unique in their own way and you gotta love them all. Scarlett is just gorgeous. You hate her and you love her. She is mean and nice. She is a very complex character and the movie sure shows that. Rhett Buttler is the handsome man who is never afraid to speak his mind even at the cost of his reputation and he is the perfect match for Scarlett. I could go on about all the characters and how well they are portrayed. But the bottom line is everything in this movie just fits perfectly. This movie is very long, but you can hardly notice it because there is so much going on and you always wanna see what's gonna happen next. The ending is just great because the viewer probably thought that in the end Scarlett will end up with Rhett, but there's some room for imagination since the movie ends with the famous line Tomorrow is another day.

I can think of many cases where this was the case. But with Gone with the wind, they did it. I first read the book and then watched the movie and I was stunned. Everything in the movie, from the settings to the characters was exactly how I pictured it. This was truly a perfect movie.I cannot think of one thing about the movie that I didn't like, not one. It's hard to believe that a movie made over 60 years ago, is the best movie ever made especially with all the technology we have today. But this is to prove that a good movie is not about special effects and computer animated beings, it's about a wonderful story and great characters. This movie proves that film is truly an art and it's a shame that not many movies nowadays show that.But let's talk about the characters for a bit. They are all unique in their own way and you gotta love them all. Scarlett is just gorgeous. You hate her and you love her. She is mean and nice. She is a very complex character and the movie sure shows that. Rhett Buttler is the handsome man who is never afraid to speak his mind even at the cost of his reputation and he is the perfect match for Scarlett.

Some things it seems are meant to be forever mysterious. But you will get some resolution, and a much more satisfying conclusion than what we got the first time around. 2001 promised a big payoff and instead delivered just a head-scratching laser-light show and a thoroughly ambiguous end to our characters' long (and I mean long) journey. Here, if your expectations are tempered you should be satisfied by what you get. Certainly no all-time classic but a worthy and generally satisfying effort.When last we left things at the end of 2001 the first mission to Jupiter had ended rather badly. Now a joint American-Soviet crew is sent to find out exactly what did happen last time and to investigate the ever-continuing strange series of events around Jupiter. As would be expected for a film made in 1984 tension between the Americans (led by Roy Scheider) and the Soviets (led by Helen Mirren) is one prevailing theme. This doesn't play as well today but the idea of bitter enemies coming together for the good of humanity never gets old I guess. After the expected tension the American and Soviet crews work well enough together. Until their respective governments get in the way. But eventually the politics is out of the way and we turn our attention to the cosmic questions left unanswered in 2001.2010 suffers from one of the same problems 2001 had. Namely, Jupiter is really far away. It is a long, slow journey and for much of the film nothing really happens. The pace is a bit quicker than 2001 and there is more interplay amongst the crew this time which is certainly welcome. Eventually we get to the stranded Discovery where HAL from 2001 makes a welcome reappearance. HAL's creator, played by Bob Balaban, is along for the ride and delves inside HAL's mind to try to get some answers. But the answers we seek aren't really going to come from HAL.

And unlike in 2001 our curiosity will be, if not entirely, at least mostly satisfied.2010 is, like its predecessor, slow, even dull at times. Watching it today the whole USA vs. USSR angle is something we could do without. But all in all it is a mostly enjoyable ride, one certainly worth taking.

Having it told by someone who wasn't even on the ship made it even worse, because giving the part to someone assuming she was 101 was unreal, completely.I could have lived without it the submarine scenes, but still, the effects for that was pretty good, kudos to James Cameron for that (Terminator is still your best work).It's good entertainment for adults, and a nice learning video for kids, although some parts of the movie (the nude scene in the cabin and the love scene in the automobile) aren't meant for children's eyes.7\/10.

It is about Indiana Jones who goes off on a quest to find his father who has disappeared while looking for the Holy Grail. He ends up going through all the challenges to get to the Grail to save his fathers life because he was shot. The way that they plotted the movie was very well done. It took place in the 1930 while world war two was occurring. You know this because in one scene Indiana Jones comes face to face with the Nazi ruler Adolph Hitler. (The man who played hit fit in with the roll pretty well because he looked just like him). This setting fit well because it made it seem more adventurous to have a man against Nazi which no one likes. And it also made it seem more adventurous and daring because technology was not big then so they used older weapons and it just made the scene better. A big thing that was noticed is that whenever something was going wrong bad sounding music would play, but when Indiana started doing something good, for example, win a fight then the theme song would begin to play. The main purpose for the music was to set the mood of each scene. The theme of the movie that was discovered was the big feud between father and son. Indiana and his father were never really close and all that Indiana wanted was to make his father proud. And throughout the movie you notice that Indiana tries impressing his father but is never successful. And finally in the end of the movie when Indiana his hold on by one hand his father finally give Indiana what he wants.

Julie Andrews was wonderful to, and it's nice to see that after all these years, she can still play a strong, and good character.
