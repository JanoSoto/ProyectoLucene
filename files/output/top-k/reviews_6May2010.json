This is my problem with Kevin Williamson's script, and this movie in general. You can't excuse a tired plot by having your hipster characters acknowledge every cliché from previous movies in the genre. It really is for five year-olds, there's nothing subtle about it at all. The viewer is beaten over the head in this film with constant references to other films in the genre. This self-awareness has been called new and edgy, instead of what it really is a total cop-out. Why write characters so self-aware of all the genre pitfalls, only to have them execute the same bad decisions in their own reality? Such a waste.Scream was heralded for being different from the pack because it was the first mainstream horror movie to parody the characters' situations and point out the flaws in the genre, but really, the idea was very simplistic. Scream differs from other genre films only in the fact the characters talk as if they're in a horror movie, while the rest of the film is just as predictable as any other movie in the genre. Changing one small ingredient in the recipe doesn't affect the end result that much. A child could have conceived the idea.The characters exist in a world where horror movies can happen just like in the fantasy of motion pictures--the killer can seemingly be everywhere at once, the heroine can elude her pursuer until the film's finale, and other characters conveniently find themselves in situations where they are far too easy for the killer to pick off. Of course, real life is a bit different, which ironically the main character says at one point in the film, right before we get treated to every horror cliché in the book before the grand finale, which plays out just like a movie. Such a shame more of an effort wasn't made to create a better movie that sent a more believable message about the genre as a whole that the killers aren't superhuman, not everything will go according to plan, the heroine will not always survive, and not everything plays out like a scene from a movie.

Granted it's not as good as the original but it stays true to what Wes Craven wanted Freddy to be; A dark, mysterious killer.. Not a games show host.. And lets be honest, it puts later entries like part 5 to shame. First I'll talk about the new main victim, admittedly it was a bit of a shock to not see the return of Nancy.. But being an entirely different film, I think it works to have an entirely different main character. Jesse, who is definitely a weaker more troubled individual is played by underground actor Mark Patton who does an amazing job Imo. You believe he is terrified of what's happening to him, never does he try to be a hero and have an action sequence with Freddy, that was left for the sequels, this is all about Freddy being the predator and the kid being the prey.. Jesse is only tormented and victimised and every scream is believable. Although he is shockingly isolated by his parents who blame drugs or insanity, Jesse's girlfriend Lisa played by Kim Myers is supportive towards Jesse and helps him discover more about Freddy and help him out, again I think this is a good acting performance. As for Freddy, it appears, like part 1, his aim is to scare and kill, not entertain us with jokes.. Not that his later character development was a problem, I just definitely prefer the darker Freddy. As for the plot, Freddy now wants to come into the real world using Jesse as a host to possess.. This may make the film visually seem a lot less surreal and possibly less creative due to cutting out a lot of dream sequences.. This can be seen as a major flaw to the audience but I can also take this in a positive way. What is lost here with visual horror, is amplified with psychological horror. We've seen what happens in the dreams in the prequel, we know Freddy is terrifying in nightmares, dont fall asleep we understand, yes it's a very fresh idea and yes there was a lot of interesting ideas that could be used for more death dream scenes, but the director, named Jack Sholder, wants to take Freddy in a different direction, not terrorising a group of teenagers with nightmares and gruesome deaths but aiming for one unfortunate victim with nightmares, twisting with his thoughts, blurring his realisation of dreams and the real world and making him madly insane. And I'm open to try experimental ideas. Freddy succeeds in a few murders this way.. First of all in the less memorable scene with Schneider, which was just plain weird and confusing I thought.. But secondly against who appears to be Jesses only male friend Ron where he is locked in his own room with a mutating Jesse.. This scene is among my top fav Freddy kills in the series.. You know what I mean, and I bet you haven't forgot about it neither.The ending is nothing special, but it works.. Again Freddys death is achieved by a female character Lisa.. Who emotionally destroys Freddy revealing her love, Jesse.. And no surprise after what you believe is a happy ending it reveals this is not end of Freddy.. He will be back again and again and again. Overall I'd give this film an 7.5 out of 10.. Not as fresh, creative nor iconic as the original, but more dark, twisted and evil....

Get prepared for endless lectures from the Characters about how great God and Jesus are, How the bible the only truth and that it some how not God's fault that people are going to the hell he made for not being Christian. All the born again Christian characters are uninteresting and charters who were more complexes become uninteresting the moment they convert to Jesus.The acting and casting is just bad. I can't really get myself to believe that Kick Cameron is a big tough reporter. The guys still looks like the kid from Growing Pains. The movie is just the beginning of films that are all motivated to promote fear and some bigotry to those who don't buy into this particular brand of Christianity. Ideas promoted in left behind are the reason why we have problems in place like the mid-east to begin with. The simply message of love all as you love your self that Jesus taught is replace with a message that benefit mega churches and politicians.To top it all off we can't even have decent acting, realistic characters and good special effects.

When I first heard the words apocalypse, end times, good vs. evil and Anti-Christ my first thought were of books and films like the Omen or The stand by Steven King. What I got in the book was badly written fundamentalist fear based propaganda. The film is not much different from my experiences with the book.The story stars Kirk Cameron (The kid from growing pains) as tough guy reporter Buck Williams and Brand Johnson as polite Rayford Steel who cheating on his overly Christian wife. It begins with Kirk reporting in Israel as the nation is about to be attacked by the Russians. The Russians? Some one's trapped in the cold war days. Anyway there reasons for waging war is for fertilizer. You read that right. They risk world war 3 for Fertilizer. Doom seem to be unavoidable as badly done CGI planes fly over the holy land but at the last seconded a strange force destroys all the planes. Killing all those men who dared anger God by joining the Russian air force. Then we moves into the to the true holy land. America! Ware we meet Brad Johnson character. His wife has become a born again Christian which seems to have caused trouble in the family. In the film they betray it as the family is having a hard time accepting what she has to preach (Believe me, there will be preaching in this film) but in real life it would more likely be along the lines that people cant stand having some one ells trying to enforce religion down our Throats.She throwing there son a Christian themed birthday party, Poor kid, but that no good sinning non-believing father of there has to go to work and fly a plane. As he dose this he is having a little romance with the flight attendant. Non-right winged Christian Characters go on to be betrayed like this in the books and the films. The true believers in Christianity are betrayed as happy, good and moral. Those who do not are portrayed as immoral, unhappy, angry, or even naive.He flys his plane that happens to have Kirk on it when half the passengers disappear only leaving behind there cloths. In one night all born again evangelical Christian who believed the bible is the literal truth and Jesus is the only way to heaven disappear along with all children under 12 years old. Planes with out pilots crash, cars with no drivers pile up on the streets causing a massive death toll to rise and parents mourn for the lost of there missing children. You think a loving God who cares for humanity would at least take people when they were not driving or flying anything that could get people killed! So thousands of people are killed in cars and plane crashs then sent to hell forever because they did not accept the God who just got them killed in the first place. As the story moves on our heroes discover that people were rapture in to heaven and now it's up to those who were left behind to convert the rest of the world to Christianity and battle the Anti-Christ.Okay.

First, what really matters is a relationship that works. Second, there is no obtainable big truth about life and death. Hence the last three minutes of the movie, which throws every shred of reality out the window.But then there is the last fifteen seconds of the movie, which is about what also really matters to Allen--the movies, alone, with the blank screen waiting. No matter that it will fade out some day.The plot is actually fairly straight forward, but it's told in a highly abstract and broken up way. And the presumed reality is interrupted, without warning, by segments of other films, starring the same people, so it's easy to lose your footing. The best advice is to watch it loosely, not worrying about the facts. And to watch it twice. I've seen it ten times by now, over thirty years, and love it every time.One reason is the filming, the photography, the sets and lights, the constant inventive and sometimes referential construction and editing. There are parts that will refer to Fellini and another amazing moment that pulls out Bergman, both directors that the real Woody Allen admires (and insists he is vastly inferior to). There are some beautiful, brief, offscreen moments that recall Ozu, and there are endless scenes that allow the camera to move through crowds with highly orchestrated strings of people (often bizarre caricatures), in a virtuosic way. (The cameraman is Gordon Willis, sometimes thought to be the greatest cinematographer since New Hollywood in the late 60s. Check his list of films on this site and gasp.)But the plot, the plot. There are those out there (I'm not one of them) who really prefer movies to make sense, and to want the plot to pull them along rather than push them away as happens here. So I'll say this much about what happens, which you should skip if you want to find out for yourself--Allen plays a movie director named Bates who is much like himself, and he is currently involved with a French speaking woman named Isobel. She represents the stability of a truly caring, loving relationship, and that stability (and her two children) scares Bates. He was previously involved with a stunning bit part actress who he raised to starring roles in his films, Dory, who is also beautifully bipolar, which he finds maddening and unworkable. But Dory has some mysterious spark and depth of character he can't get over, a touch for something deeper, which is always in his quest. Meanwhile, at the film festival that is the main site of the plot, he falls for a much (much) younger woman, Daisy, and that begins to mess with his head, too.You really can follow those threads through pretty well, and survive. Or just sit back, grab a few laughs, and be dazzled by the visuals and the editing and the inventiveness of it all. And the truth it so well represents.

Harry alludes to a poem that Michel wrote in high school along with a sci-fi novel as well as pointing to an incident in which Michel chipped his tooth while rough-housing during a soccer match.The problem is that Michel is unable to recognize Harry and this crucial plot point doesn't really ring true. It's unlikely that Michel would forget about Harry completely especially when we later learn that Michel's dentist father did some bridge work for him and Michel's brother Eric also can recall who he is.

On the way, Harry maneuvers his car behind the parents' car and manages to push them off the road, down a cliff. While the parents are killed, we never learn why. The only clue that's offered is that Harry was upset over some poor dental work that Michel's father was responsible for in the distant past.The death of the parents puts Michel into a tailspin.

Instead of hiding the body himself, he asks Michel to help him dispose of it by throwing it down a well in the front yard. After Michel helps Harry to dispose of Plum, Harry then simply asks Michel to help him slaughter Claire and the kids. Did you ever hear of a serial killer who becomes obsessed with one family member but wants to kill everyone else? In real life, serial killers end up killing everybody but not here! Michel comes to his senses and stabs Harry with a knife; he then throws him down the well and then shovels dirt so that the bodies will not be found.All's well that ends well when Claire asks Michel what happened to Harry and Plum and he tells them they had to leave but left sending their love. The upside is that Harry stoked Michel's creative fires after all.

And George Stevens would go on and give us even more directorial triumphs, most notably Giant, among others. This film is a tear-jerker. If you are sensitive and sentimental, you will love this film and you will be deeply touched by it. I recommend it as a departure from the breakneck cinema we have to-day because of its humanizing qualities. We cannot live in the past...it's gone..over and done with...but, thank goodness, we have some very fine relics and re-minders and examples of love and caring that seem--at times--unreal, but which actually existed and which tend to bring us back in touch with the warmer sides of life and of ourselves.

This is not a new film, nor a new situation, but the stellar performances stand the test of time and speak to us down through the decades. I don't think a film like this could be made to-day, I don't know who could interpret the roles with same passion as Grant and Dunne and Buchanan. And George Stevens would go on and give us even more directorial triumphs, most notably Giant, among others. This film is a tear-jerker. If you are sensitive and sentimental, you will love this film and you will be deeply touched by it. I recommend it as a departure from the breakneck cinema we have to-day because of its humanizing qualities. We cannot live in the past...it's gone..over and done with...but, thank goodness, we have some very fine relics and re-minders and examples of love and caring that seem--at times--unreal, but which actually existed and which tend to bring us back in touch with the warmer sides of life and of ourselves.

Boy meets girl, they fall in love, and they get married. His work takes him to Japan. His already pregnant wife arrives several months later, and they are both ecstatic at the prospect of having their first child...until fate most unkind steps in...in the form of an earthquake. Both survive, but the fetus does not. Further complications have it that the mother will never again bear children. To keep the marriage afloat, they adopt. Grant can't get with it at first, but as time marches on, he finds himself more in love with children than his spouse. They endure the hardships of life, short finances and the lot, as well as navigating the ups and downs of childhood for their precious baby. Fate steps in again...and the child dies...and along with the child the marriage seems to be over as well. It seems hopeless at that moment...but fortuna has the final say-so in the matter. The performances in this film are genuine and believable. Irene Dunne is terrific as the wife, and Edgar Buchanan, long before his Uncle Joe heyday, delivers solid support as Apple-Jack. But the kudos here belong to Grant. Forget The Philadelphia Story or His Girl Friday or He Done Her Wrong. I have not seen all of Grant's films, though I have seen many of them...some of them relatively obscure, in fact. But of all the Grant films I have seen, including North By Northwest, this truly is Grant's magnum opus.

At first glance the term seems oxymoronic. Why? Because in Freudian psychology, sublimation refers to the process whereby a natural human drive (eg sex) is transferred or sublimated into a more socially acceptable form (eg film or music). Desublimation, however, posits the reverse. Here the subject's allowed unrestricted, direct access to their desires (eg porn, rape).By attaching the seemingly contradictory modifier of repressive, Marcuse thus challenges common sense to come to terms with the potentially repressive effects of desublimation. In other words, when the gratification of immediate material and sensual needs becomes the prevailing concern of men, then the ideals of freedom or even democracy have no chance.Marcuse's analysis of this problem is of course relevant to our own political culture today, in which policy decisions are increasingly founded upon an economic logic rather than that of freedom or the preservation of liberty. But this was the case even 50 years ago, when Marcuse travelled to the US, then the wealthiest, supposedly the most open society in the world, and tried to warn people about what he called the encroaching totalitarianism of the capitalist Establishment - the very regime under which the US had achieved its enviable position in the world. Marcuse believed that postmodern capitalism had internalised Marxism (at least in its Stalinist deformation) and would increasingly resemble a perverse hybrid of Soviet-style totalitarianism and US-style consumerism. In this world, commodities, art and objects are not just a means of distraction, but the Ideology itself.Of course no one took Marcuse seriously, but he expected this. Where is the repression in a society in which copies of the works of Plato, Hegel, Marx and Freud are available in the drugstore for anyone who cares to read them? Marcuse asks in his book, One-Dimensional Man. In other words, given that the resources of principled rational opposition are everywhere available, must one not presume that the absence of such opposition is indicative of the absence of any reason to question or oppose the status quo, even indeed of the actuality of freedom in the West? Marcuse's answer is that one must not so presume; to do so would be to confuse happiness with freedom, contentment with emancipation. The logic of repressive desublimation was then supposed to be Marcuse's critical response to this presumption. By allowing &#x96; even encouraging - certain forms of desublimation (freedom), Marcuse argues, systems actually distract attention from their oppressive and authoritarian character. On a more subtle and dangerous level, the availability of Plato in the drugstore actually works to undermine the possibility of taking a critical stand against the repressive aspects of the society, firstly, because one simply becomes too comfortable to rock the boat, the logic of one's wallet overcoming one's rational judgement, and secondly, because the very availability of Plato in the drugstore operates as a vehicle for the retrenchment of the Establishment. Not only because the Establishment can say to its critics, You are free; could you get Plato in the drugstore elsewhere?, but more subtly and perversely, because in the mind of the subject, the fact of his immediate contentment precludes the possibility of taking Plato seriously.And this is what Marcuse means by his Clockwork sounding One-Dimensional Society. Any society that has not reached a state of perfection - and no society has - must necessarily be at least a two dimensional society - a society in which the status quo and the ideal stand in conflict with each other. It is that conflict which generates change for the better. But in this clockwork society of ours, that second dimension &#x96; the utopian dimension - is increasingly vanishing.Art and philosophy (ie high culture) have traditionally been the guardians of this second, utopian dimension. In art, desire for utopia is sublimated into representations of utopia &#x96; either positively (Bach, Mozart, Hegel), as more or less direct expressions of perfection or beauty, or negatively (Brecht, Swift, Kubrick, Marx), as representations of the distance or difference or dissonance between the way things are and the way they ought to be.Today the aim of philosophy is not the sublimation of the utopian desire, but rather its desublimation - not art, but action; not philosophy, but revolution. But apart from the effective existence of this second dimension of thought, there is no basis in consciousness for a critical stand toward society, and therefore no basis for practical action. That is the problem of the one-dimensional or clockwork society. And you see that in this film in Alex's postmodern world of rampant commodification, in which art and objects are now thoroughly impotent, Alex believes the only to be truly free is to transcend into ultra violence; freedom is equated with a specific creativity, a destructive re-energising of objects, performance and art. Or to quote Albert Camus The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.And this is the dark irony of Marcuse's analysis of repressive desublimation. Today desublimation (rampant, unrestricted desires) is the norm and is indeed the practical result of our economic order; capitalism is devoted to the creation of desire (and the illusion of satiation). We might expect that this would be just what is wanted. But, as Marcuse shows, not all forms of desublimation are emancipatory. Some preclude the possibility of emancipation in subtle ways.10\/10 &#x96; Worth multiple viewings.

The two grotesque creations are the salvation for those who may become further victims.There is so much in this film. A cat fight is staged, but it is so funny that we don't mind the contrivance. We see the mad scientist struggle to get a victim, and meeting obstacle after obstacle.How could it be better? The ending was a bit too hastily done, it seemed. And a lot of the beautiful women seemed to be contrived to be on camera. A lot of the low budget direction was extremely well done, however. The use of the knocking on the door, the cutaways, and other mechanisms could give modern film makers examples of how to make better films.

At summer camp the kids learn of the wedding between this mysterious nanny and uncle Festor and they insist on getting home to stop it, but it is too late as the nanny has married Festor and made him promise to no longer associate with the rest of the clan. She tries to kill him to get the inheritance, the kids have to suffer the annoying camp counselors and other children and granny, Morticia and Gomez have to deal with the curse on their new born.Yea my description sucks but I hate trying to explain how bad movies are. This movie was the same boring type of plot as the first one. It offered nothing new and although it had a few laughs it was still worse than the original.Sonnefeld's direction was even lazier and the music was worse. They tried the TV theme song and kept playing it in different musical styles. The cool song they picked to promote the movie was by rap group Tag Team doing basically Whoop, There It Is and adding lyrics about the Addams family, how boring is that...rap songs are always flavors of the week and will never be popular as little as a year in the future. Too bad they dropped out with the Michael Jackson song.The old cast is back, the grandma has been replaced with the wonderful Carol Kane and she does such a better job. Joan Cusack plays the nanny and once again Christinna Ricci is the star of the film, with her brilliant sarcastic lines. Raul Julia, Angelica Houston and Christopher Lloyd did exactly as they did before, but there was more screen time for Morticia and Gomez. I was always most fond of Lurch but neither of these movies focused on him at all. The counselors did a great job too, very funny. Also some great cameos by people like Peter Graves and Nathan Lane.Perhaps kids might like it, but movies like this are just a waste of time to me, although they have fans and a following, they just lack comedy and can't handle the test of time 1\/10 stars.

It may not be the kind of serious-minded movie which first comes to mind when thinking of classic films. But it is a rollicking good time. And this movie, produced over 70 years ago and telling a story which is centuries old, still holds up remarkably well today. OK, maybe not absolutely everything holds up perfectly. To the modern viewer some of the humor may fall a little flat and yes at times things are undeniably hokey. So what? The movie as a whole still works. Set your little quibbles aside and just sit back and enjoy the swashbuckling sensation that is Errol Flynn as Robin Hood.Everyone knows the story of Robin Hood so a plot recap is rather besides the point. As this particular telling of the tale unfolds there are mostly pluses but a few minuses as well. The biggest plus of all is completely obvious. That would be Errol Flynn. No matter how many Robin Hood movies Hollywood churns out Flynn remains forever unmatched. In looks, words and actions he is the perfect Robin Hood. The performance of a lifetime. And he is surrounded by a mostly wonderful supporting cast. Basil Rathbone as the villainous Sir Guy of Gisbourne, Claude Rains as a somewhat effete Prince John and the luminous Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marian all do excellent work. As do the band of actors portraying Robin's Merry Men. It's a wonderfully acted film. But for as good as the cast are their performances are almost overshadowed by how amazing the film looks. The screen comes alive with the most vibrant color imaginable. This movie is a Technicolor marvel. Start to finish the film looks great but the archery tournament scene really stands out in its stunning beauty. This really is an almost impossibly beautiful movie. They don't make them like this anymore. So you've got the classic Robin Hood story, wonderful performances from some brilliant actors and a visual spectacle the likes of which we will never see again. But if that's not enough for you Erich Wolfgang Korngold provides one of the most fabulous scores in film history ensuring that this film is a treat for the ears as well as the eyes.With all that going for it this film can't help but succeed. But there are a few nagging quibbles. While nobody in his right mind would criticize de Havilland's performance there is the sense she isn't given enough to do. Maid Marian really is not developed much as a character, we don't really get to know her very well at all. And that makes the inevitable romantic storyline a little less powerful than perhaps it could have been. There is one character who unfortunately sticks out like a sore thumb and that is the Sheriff of Nottingham, portrayed here as a laughable, bumbling idiot. It's probably not the fault of the actor, Melville Cooper, it's just the way the character was written. Guy of Gisbourne is set up as Robin's main villainous foil, the Sheriff of Nottingham seems to be there for comic relief. But it doesn't really work for the poor Sheriff. While the movie as a whole has aged well there are those moments sprinkled throughout that seem more than a little cornball to the modern eye, and concerning the dialogue, to the modern ear. But what do you want from a 70-year old movie? Best to ignore the little nitpicks and enjoy this movie for what it is. It's undeniable fun, a movie which will be remembered fondly forever.

You know what&#x85; if I want to, I could watch it tonight with no hesitation. I don't know why, but Bright Lights, Big City simply impressed me. Watching it the second time around, I picked up on a lot symbolic parallels running through the effectively told story on substance abuse \/ addiction. Not that they weren't noticeable the first time, but on this occasion they simply clicked. Another thing was the staying power of Michael J. Fox's outstanding central performance. He sells it, a multi-facet turn as a character truly lost under the alluring yuppie Manhattan nightlife scene of neon lights, drugs, alcohol and women. One day wasted after another, where it's hard to distinguish the morphing days and what becomes a downward spiral into descent. And why this option to escape personal damage, because he can't handle what's in front of him. Double vodka and lines of coke. Yeah the character forgets his hurt for the time being, but the effect of this culture deadens him from reality and inspirations. This means the problems only boil over. He risks his job (although he doesn't love it), family (who he has pushed away after his mother's death of cancer) and importantly his own well-being. So I guess its not particularly a happy-shinny outing and it isn't suppose to be, despite some periods played for laughs (namely the scenes with David Warrilow and a payback prank that gets out of hand involving a ferret), it remains powerfully confronting in its depiction.Jamie Conway finds himself wasting his days in a banally demanding job, because as an aspiring fiction writer he's completely stuck with writer's block and to make matters worse his model wife (Phoebe Cates) left him to advance her career. No explanation why, just gone. And his mum had died of leukaemia, which still seems to haunt him. So in the dumps, he ends up going out every night with his pal Tad (Kiefer Sutherland) getting hammered to only wake-up to go through the same routine again, but the lifestyle begins to catch-up on him. Where he slowly begins to open up his eyes to what's happening to his life, and its coming up to the one-year anniversary of his mother's death.There's a sub-plot running through the narrative, where it has newspapers and TV news shows reporting on a coma baby, that the mother is having trouble giving birth to. This symbolic insert (where it does have one oddly surreal dream sequence) perceives the manner of how Fox's character lives in a bubble (or coma), not wanting to face or hear about reality at first despite his troubled and bitter mindset and best efforts from those who really care for him (especially his scenes involving his brother --- admirably performed by Charlie Schlatter). Also the charming Swoosie Kurtz, plays the character Megan which is Jamie's co-worker who can be seen somewhat a surrogate mother figure for Jamie, especially the way she's always picking up after him and calling him to make sure his awake so he's not late at work. Because he's skating on thin ice with the constant attention of the bosses (exemplary performances by Frances Sternhagen and John Houseman) --- coming in late too often and numerous errors finding its way into his work due to a lack of commitment and drive. Eventually after the frustrating build up (losing job, ex-girlfriend back in town), she is the one that he spills his guts out too. Throughout we get peering flashbacks (namely in the mid-to-latter end) of Jamie talking to his bed-ridden mother (an engagingly vibrant Dianne Wiest), where we learn what's happening to her and then she questions him about his life topics. These moments are movingly done, and when he starts thinking of them it becomes a shock to the system in simply facing the facts. Other than Kurtz's character, the other genuine character to help him was Tad's sister Vicky (warmly performed by Tracy Pollan). What Jamie saw in Vicky was someone who was down-to-earth, where he could naturally be around without the use of drugs to liven the occasion. Around her he felt normal, and there was sincerity to their interactions that he could trust and confide. He's reborn (think of coma baby) after his coming to terms telephone conversation with Vicky and utters a memorable line to Tad. While around his yuppie friends (or bad companions); led by Tad (an excellently suave Keifer Sutherland). They didn't really know each other or really took time out to do so. Whenever together it was a shallow illustration of senseless partying throughout long, lost nights. A fitting Phoebe Cates in what small scenes she does have looks great and creates an interestingly vain character that has you totally hook to why she left Jamie. His jealousy of her success really soars in some sequences. Throughout the whole experience you feel like you're in his shoes or better in his head riding the lows.Director James Bridges moodily stylish and slick handling neatly combines the hustle and bustle of the nightlife NY scene.

It certainly isn't the scariest film I've ever seen, but I love it's creativity and atmosphere that I'm willing to overlook it's flaws.This is not a jump scare type of horror film, it fact throughout most of the movie it doesn't really try to SCARE you really, it mostly tries to creep you out. So if you are not a patient person, and believe me, I'm not the most patient person in the world either, than you will hate this film. It can be very tedious at times, and kind of boring. Plus I think we needed at least one more day before the crew started going crazy, but maybe that's just me. And don't watch it with a headache, I did that and I wanted to vomit.What it does do well it make a realistic atmosphere. There are people who still believe this was real, showing how realistic this movie is. The characters, aren't really characters, they're real people. No really, not only are all the actors using their real names, but the directors didn't really give them a full script, they told the actors that the legend was real and would actually make noises to freak them out to make this as realistic as possible. And because of that, I felt sympathy for these three even though they were all kind of a$$holes. Their not movie a$$holes, they're real people a$$holes, and yes there's a difference. And the film has a sense of humor to it, this is actually kind of personal as when something bad happens to me I will sometimes try to add a little humor to the situation to make it seem less bad.The Blair Witch Project is not the scariest film ever made, it's more of a creepy film. What it does best is create a realistic atmosphere and characters that you can sympathise with, and leads to one of the best ending of all time, that leaves a bit up to the imagination. Plus, the backstory to this witch is very detailed and well thought out.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 May 2010","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Blair Witch certainly is one of the polorizing movies.

You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone that wouldn't give this movie some thought before ever heading into the ocean again. This story is essentially a man versus nature tale, and serves as a reminder that although we are the most intelligent species on the planet, there are forces of nature bigger than we are.Jaws succeeds in establishing a dynamic group of characters whose interactions with one another are interesting to watch. The war veteran turned fisherman gets his rocks off by teasing the intellectual scientist, the chief just tries to keep peace to save his community...the dynamics of the relationships were interesting enough. Where I feel Jaws fails is in the story department, because although we have some interesting multi-faceted characters, the plot is still that of a B-movie. The story of a shark terrorizing a coastal community could easily have been a Roger Corman production. Spielberg manages to elevate the material to A-level status with his use of great actors and a script that fleshes the characters out more than any B-movie would attempt, and his direction produces some genuine moments of suspense, but it's predictable fare. There are few surprises for the viewer, and anyone that believes the movie will end with the shark still alive hasn't seen enough Hollywood films.I commend Spielberg for making entire generations afraid to go into the water. But nevertheless let's not forget this is a popcorn film, elevated slightly by a good set of characters.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"6 May 2010","score":"","review":" The Coen Brothers go along way to catch the essence of what life is like in a town without much crime or power. The acting is flawless with Frances Mcdormand leading the way as a pregnant police chief who is smart enough to see that something out of the ordinary is happening in the country parts of Minnesota. The whole way that the Coen's had Mcdormand and her partner access the murders and go about finding out more about it is absolutely hysterical. I am from Minnesota and many of the characters sounded a lot like the cousins and grandparents I have in the country in Minnesota. The you betchas and other lines are key to the realism of the film. I truly appreciate the most important part of the film though. The versimilitude and the ability of the Coen Brothers to go to extreme lengths just to show you, that in life in order to be happy and satisfied sometimes you just have to be grateful for what you have. That is why the downfall of the car salesman played by William H. Macy is so disturbing because all he had to do was ask for help and be grateful for the family that was left for him at home. The atmosphere and the depth of shots to show you the wilderness of Minnesota is breathtaking and at times you can almost feel the breeze of the cold Minnesota winter as the movie carries from scene to scene. Overall, this was one hell of a Coen Brothers film and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys dark American comedy.
