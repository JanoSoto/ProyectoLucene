I must admit to having seen this one before, but I only remember bits and pieces of the story. It was nice to see it again so I could cast my critical eye over it. It's great to look at with some iconic American scenery, not to mention Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis! I enjoyed it although there were a couple of niggles that I will tell you about after this brief summary.Repressed housewife Thelma decides to not tell her husband, Darryl, when she goes off on a trip with her friend Louise Sawyer. They are headed to a cabin in the mountains for a couple of days fishing and chillin' out. On the way they stop at a bar for something to eat and things get a bit out of hand; I won't say how or why (spoilers), but it is pretty serious. They make a break for it and hole up in a motel while they decide what to do. Eventually Louise makes the decision that they will escape to Mexico. For this they will need money and her boyfriend, Jimmy, proves to be the solution to that. Meanwhile the police, in the guise of Hal and Max are on their trail. Add to the mix a young hitchhiker called J.D. that Thelma takes a shine to and we got us a road trip to remember! I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police will be tailing me right to the edge of the Grand Canyon.As I've already mentioned, this film is beautifully shot with some fantastically cinematic moments. Ridley Scott certainly has an eye for these things and they are a feature of all of his films. I couldn't fault any of the performances either; Susan Sarandon as Louise Sawyer and Geena Davis as Thelma are both fantastic. Harvey Keitel did an excellent job as the caring cop, Hal, as did Michael Madsen as Jimmy. Also worthy of note were Christopher McDonald as Darryl and Stephen Tobolowsky (whose podcast is great by the way&#x85;), as Max. Oh, and there was this young actor&#x85; eye-candy (for the ladies) really&#x85; some guy called Brad Pitt played the part of J.D.I said at the beginning that I had a couple of niggles, well, here goes, one is that the film starts off really well and then has a bit of a dull stodgy middle part before picking up again towards the end. I see this far too often in films and it's beginning to get a bit old (for me) I'm afraid. Secondly, I found the film a little too long, cut out some of the stodgy middle and I would have been a little happier. OK, that's all for the niggles. I found there was a lot more humour in it than I remember, but it was quite sporadic. The ending was very touching and did make up for some of the niggles, (but not all of them). The musical score mostly consists of Country songs, but I much preferred the incidental music by Hans Zimmer, in fact I had a bet that he wrote it while I was watching the film! I now owe myself a pint. Over all, though, I still thought this film was great, superb performances, great cinematography, some great music, oh, and a pretty good plot too&#x85; Recommended.My Score 7.8\/10.IMDb Score 7.3\/10 (based on 50,471 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score 92\/100 (based on 50 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

Once there, explorer Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) tries to figure out if it's true that no one here grows old and that everything can be accomplished simply through peace and kindness. At the same time, some of the other people aboard the plane aren't crazy about staying as they find these stories to be fake. LOST HORIZON is yet another classic held very high by film buffs and thank God Frank Capra directed it because in anyone else's hands the film would have been a disaster. Like many Capra movies, this one here preaches about kindness and it preaches about all humans living better if only they were kind to one another. I think we'd all agree that it's a good message but Capra, as usual, really beats the viewer over the head and to my thinking he's the only director able to do such a thing without making you turn the film off. I was really impressed with this movie even though there are some very big flaws that I'll get to in a second. What impressed me most was the atmosphere that the director was able to create because it really does feel as if you're in a far away place that no one knows about. The settings of Shangri-La aren't anything overly special but the nature and care that Capra brings to it really makes the thing stand out. Of course, another major plus is that Colman is giving one of the greatest performances of his career. I think one of the hardest things for any actor to do is to think on the screen. This is the type of role that requires the lead character to do a lot of thinking and while the character is taking in everything being fed to him, it really does seem as if Colman is taking it all in, thinking about it and trying to come to some sort of conclusion. I really loved the way Colman played the part and he was certainly the right actor for it. The supporting cast includes a strong performance by Jane Wyatt as well as good turns by Edward Everett Horton, John Howard, Thomas Mitchell and Sam Jaffe. Apparently Harry Cohn wasn't too impressed with the performance of H.B. Warner but I thought he did a very good job in the role of Chang. When one discusses LOST HORIZON they have to discuss its history as Capra originally screened a version that ran over three-hours but after a disastrous screening it was cut to 132-minutes. Over the years Cohn, who always felt it was too long, decided to edit it down several times until it was eventually lost to time. The film was eventually restored and the lost scenes added back but there are still seven minutes worth of audio with no picture. These scenes have photos in their place and while it's certainly distracting at least the audio has survived. Now, the one major flaw with the picture is that it is too long. The film's middle really starts to drag in spots but thankfully it finally picks up for a pretty emotional ending.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"30 September 2011","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Lost Horizon (1937) *** 1\/2 (out of 4) Frank Capra's fantasy about a group of people whose plane is hijacked and they're taken to the mysterious Shangri-La. Once there, explorer Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) tries to figure out if it's true that no one here grows old and that everything can be accomplished simply through peace and kindness. At the same time, some of the other people aboard the plane aren't crazy about staying as they find these stories to be fake. LOST HORIZON is yet another classic held very high by film buffs and thank God Frank Capra directed it because in anyone else's hands the film would have been a disaster. Like many Capra movies, this one here preaches about kindness and it preaches about all humans living better if only they were kind to one another. I think we'd all agree that it's a good message but Capra, as usual, really beats the viewer over the head and to my thinking he's the only director able to do such a thing without making you turn the film off. I was really impressed with this movie even though there are some very big flaws that I'll get to in a second. What impressed me most was the atmosphere that the director was able to create because it really does feel as if you're in a far away place that no one knows about. The settings of Shangri-La aren't anything overly special but the nature and care that Capra brings to it really makes the thing stand out. Of course, another major plus is that Colman is giving one of the greatest performances of his career. I think one of the hardest things for any actor to do is to think on the screen. This is the type of role that requires the lead character to do a lot of thinking and while the character is taking in everything being fed to him, it really does seem as if Colman is taking it all in, thinking about it and trying to come to some sort of conclusion. I really loved the way Colman played the part and he was certainly the right actor for it. The supporting cast includes a strong performance by Jane Wyatt as well as good turns by Edward Everett Horton, John Howard, Thomas Mitchell and Sam Jaffe. Apparently Harry Cohn wasn't too impressed with the performance of H.B. Warner but I thought he did a very good job in the role of Chang. When one discusses LOST HORIZON they have to discuss its history as Capra originally screened a version that ran over three-hours but after a disastrous screening it was cut to 132-minutes. Over the years Cohn, who always felt it was too long, decided to edit it down several times until it was eventually lost to time. The film was eventually restored and the lost scenes added back but there are still seven minutes worth of audio with no picture. These scenes have photos in their place and while it's certainly distracting at least the audio has survived. Now, the one major flaw with the picture is that it is too long. The film's middle really starts to drag in spots but thankfully it finally picks up for a pretty emotional ending.

It serves as probably my favorite Robin Williams film, and proof that many comedic actors can take on a dramatic role effectively. The problem is, many don't take the opportunity when it comes.Robin Williams plays Seymour Sy Parrish, a photo-developer at a corporate giant known as SavMart. Despite Sy's soft-spoken, and generally harmless aging man appearance, he is actually a very depressed man who obsesses over the seemingly perfect family of the Yorkins. The Yorkins are the typical American family; a husband, a wife, and a young boy. Sy has been developing the Yorkin family photos for years, and is assuming the role of Uncle Sy in the Yorkin family.He does this, of course, because he does not have a family of his own. He lives alone in an apartment with a collage of photos of the Yorkins. All the pictures are plastered to the wall in order and neatness, leaving no gaps or overlaps. He begins to stalk the family after a certain period of time, and from that moment on, Sy isn't so harmless anymore - but actually mentally ill and in dire need of psychological help.Robin Williams jumps right into the role of Sy Parrish. He's creepy, stylish, believable, and scary. From the guy who has done things like Jumanji and other nonsensical films, here comes something you'd never see from a man who played a sailor who loved spinach at one point in his life.But the true talent here is director Mark Romanek, who has worked on many music videos for Nine Inch Nails, R.E.M., and Weezer. Romanek stayed true to the story of the film, revealing more and more informations about Sy and his intentions for the story that he made subtly on purpose. He gives descriptive backstory on why Sy is the way he is at the end, but you may have to do research to piece together everything. While Romanek explained a lot, you still have to come up with your own explanation for the ending. And my view on it is something I dare not give away because I feel it's one of the most mind-boggling, yet, thought-provoking endings in recent memory.During the course of the film, Sy narrates over it, which is nothing but fantastic. His narrations are very relaxed, in a quiet tone for much of the time. And scenes where he explains his customers and what pictures they take is extra information you wouldn't think a film like One Hour Photo would contain. Even graphic insight and personal opinions on cameras and pictures are given here. The film goes outside of its plot boundaries to deliver explicit detail to the audience. I can't thank Romanek enough for giving this an extra dimension to work with.I found this a tiny bit relatable to the film LOOK, which was made about seven years after this. LOOK was directed by Adam Rifkin, a relatively unsung director who shot the entire film with security cameras giving authentic depth and feel to it, while following not-so-innocent people around and connecting them in an anthology-like format. Both this and that show people that we could be being watched and not even know it. That's the power these films bring. And you only get more skeptical every time you watch them.One Hour Photo, even with repeated viewings, is disturbing, and visually interesting. It's creepy to think about Sy's actions, but it's even creepier thinking that back when film was developed constantly, and places like Walgreens and Wal-Mart's One Hour Photo booths used to be filled with customers, how easy it was to obtain one person's pictures. It's amazing to think just five or six years ago we used to be protective with our pictures, count on them being done in one hour, and then only be shown to a certain number of people. When now, we upload pictures to our computers and then make them so the whole world can see.

Right down to my fundamental worldview, I am a Buster Keaton person, the face a mask that stoically accepts the door slamming shut; so I find it beyond irksome and trite every time the tramp is by some miraculous chain of events restored into happiness. The world as I understand it just doesn't work this way; kings and beggars alike have the same toll to pay. So wishing it did only fosters more pain.This is actually worst than The Kid in this respect. Our lowly hero eventually gets the dream girl, but only after he has allowed himself to be dragged in pursuit of gold. Oh, though filthy rich at that point, when in the end he falls practically in the girl's arms he is again dressed like a tramp - meaning, no doubt, he is still the same person - but where usually the hero sacrifices superficial, worldly pleasures for the deeper calling that fulfills the soul, here he gets both. There is not even the thought of a compromise.Yet I can't help but connect here with one specific aspect of Chaplin's cosmology; the mysterious, elusive fates - seemingly random, but slowly revealed to be guiding purpose - that govern life and toss it about through so many clashing rocks.Nowhere is this sketched more poignantly than in the famous cliffhanger scene. The tramp wakes in the same cabin he was earlier; familiar surroundings from inside, the reality thought to be known, understood, domesticated into order, but from outside we see how this reality hangs in precarious balance above the void. So, every step inside, taken casually, without much thought, is revealed from outside to have terrifying consequences that govern life and death. 'Blissful ignorance', the intertitle aptly describes the situation inside the cabin.It is a powerful cosmologic symbol, what in Eastern philosophy is understood as karma, fate flowing not from some lofty precipice of the gods above but from inside the house of everyday life. With both gold and love, impossible love with the dream girl, as the chimeras that trick the mind.So Chaplin is gifted enough to see the world as it manifests itself to us on some fundamental level, as in the dream sequence in The Kid where we see the devil tricking the soul from inside, but either cannot properly understand &#x96; and confuses karma for providential fate - or he does, is terrified, and chooses to soothe us instead with a fairy- tale.So however well-meant, it's a dishonest, patronizing vision of bliss. Once more these forces are finally shown to be the challenging, but eventually benevolent whims of providence. It's all made right again, more than right.Notice how well integrated is this notion inside the film, proof that all else aside Chaplin was a talented film mind; we are so closely made to identify with the point-of-view of the tramp, who is kept in blissful ignorance of the larger soul-defining mechanisms that shape his life, that we come out of the film from our position as viewers buying this fantasy as an important lesson.So instead of coming out of the film realizing that we should seize control of our own footsteps in life that keep our world in balance, or assume responsibility for when it trickles down the hill, just wait and it'll all work out in the end. It is a clever manipulation into blissful ignorance, with the filmmaker playing our strings the same way invisible fates play with the character inside the film.Sure, it is occasionally very funny, inventive.

I would hesitate to categorize it as horror, for there are no truly scary scenes in the film - the effect of the few jump shocks, too, fade away too fast. Sfx-wise, true, the metamorphozing scenes from human to monster are well executed, but, beyond that, fail to terrify, or even, for that matter, to thrill.

Not that he's abused or anything (his house looks like it costs a million dollars, and it's all paid for by his father's job as a pants inspector and the pants inspector jokes are just the first in the long list of cheesy one-liners this movie is filled with) but his parents commit the great crime of not paying attention to him at the dinner table.And then there's what follows, which is North's journey to divorce his parents who are so shocked to hear the news that they both fall into a coma (and for some reason are later put on display at a museum) and the judge tells Noth he needs to find new parents before the summer is over.This journey takes North to Texas, Hawaii, Alaska, and onwards, where North meets auditioning parents, whose character portrayals take ethnic stereotyping to point that is so desperate and over-the-top that it makes you want to puke (seriously? Kathy Bates putting black-face on to portray an Eskimo? REALLY??) Every character in this movie is stupid, vulgar, and cold-hearted to the point of sadism.

He's supposed to portrayed as a guardian angel who follows North along his journey, (being portrayed as an Easter Bunny, a cowboy, a beach bum, a FedEx driver, and a sleigh driver) but he's incredibly unhelpful and only serves to throw in some phony pseudo-philosophical gems of wisdom dabbed with more lame jokes.The best parallel I can make with this movie is to compare it to that Rebecca Black's notorious music video Friday. When you see it, it is so bad that you cannot believe it can possibly be real.

The boy called North (Elijah Wood) is a darling little overachiever who is upset because his parents don't appreciate him. Not that he's abused or anything (his house looks like it costs a million dollars, and it's all paid for by his father's job as a pants inspector and the pants inspector jokes are just the first in the long list of cheesy one-liners this movie is filled with) but his parents commit the great crime of not paying attention to him at the dinner table.And then there's what follows, which is North's journey to divorce his parents who are so shocked to hear the news that they both fall into a coma (and for some reason are later put on display at a museum) and the judge tells Noth he needs to find new parents before the summer is over.This journey takes North to Texas, Hawaii, Alaska, and onwards, where North meets auditioning parents, whose character portrayals take ethnic stereotyping to point that is so desperate and over-the-top that it makes you want to puke (seriously? Kathy Bates putting black-face on to portray an Eskimo? REALLY??) Every character in this movie is stupid, vulgar, and cold-hearted to the point of sadism.
