Much of this film's dialogue was rather banal and innefective.  Liam Neeson was decent in his role, but even his performance was somehow subdued by the barrage of special effects blasting out of the screen.  The one suprise of the movie was that Jake Lloyd, the lad playing Anakin Skywalker, actually pulled off the best performance among the whole lot of them.  Shows you what budding talent can do, hmmm?

As I watched the film, I found myself drifting back to other movies, sci-fi films from the Nineties, and I began to rate this movie up alongside those films.  Certainly, Star Wars is heads and tails above even the colossal Jurrasic Park in the special effects department.  It's creation and bending of reality allows us to see things, as if we are looking into some bizarre dream.  Truly a halluciogenic quality.

The script wasn't written well, and all the jokes were completely flat. In the beginning at least you could try to stifle a giggle, but later you yawn and wait for the flick to end. Obviously every outcome is laid out in front of you even before you sit down in the theater if you have seen the other three episodes. Once all the characters have been introduced our pre-introduced, you may as well predict what they will do. The special effects are stellar, though, showing what movie-makers are capable of showing. Originality has almost disappeared in this movie, and basically every alien has some similarity with anything else on TV or anywhere else. Personally I felt a bit uncomfortable for a rather foolish reason when the big battle was taking place with all those fancy ships and blasters. Where were the X- and Y-wings? When were those AT-ATs going to show up? The events of this movie obviously take place before all those well-known ships and objects were invented, but the old vehicles look pretty neat too. Episode I is the perfect example of how a prequel sets the stage for the rest of the acts. The end partly pulls you along into the fourth Episode, and the entire story line just flows. In the first Star Wars movie, the old characters who appear in Episode I actually tell of tiny things that actually happen in this film. The saga is truly shown and expressed, but without the heart and laughter as in the first movie. I feel Lucas is losing his touch, and I won't be surprised if Episodes II and III would be complete failures. The magic of Star Wars seems to be disappearing, and this film is the proof.

Not quite.  Is it a bad movie?  Certainly not.  Could it have been better?  Yes.  Is it fun?  Absolutely.The plot doesn't come together quite as easily as it should.  Things are a little confusing and the editing is very choppy.  At times it feels like the beginning and end of every scene was lopped off.  The final battle sequence is also where the movie's inherent flaw rears its ugly head.  The victory can't be cherished because we know, before long the bad guys will win out. Anakin is an adorable kid, but we know he's going to turn out to be Darth Vader.There is some new information the nature and mechanics of the Force is elaborated upon, but the details we're given only raise more questions. We also learn some things that seem to contradict what we know from episodes IV, V & VI, as if Lucas is changing the rules of the universe his fans know so well, or maybe he's just making it up as he goes along.  The final scenes only hint at the developments to come in the next two installments.  When he gets around to making those, let's hope Lucas brings in someone to help with the script the way Lawrence Kasden did for Episodes V & VI.The special effects are a marvel to look at.  The film is a stunning visual layer cake that will need several repeat viewings to truly appreciate. But the chemistry between the human elements is lacking.  Not that the cast could not provide it, but Lucas' script doesn't give them a chance.  No one in this film can manage to do what Harrison Ford did in the original -- rise above the material.  All the actors here seem lost, as if they were given no direction at all.  Neeson does the best job.  McGregor isn't given much to do besides perfect his Alec Guinness impersonation; his talent is wasted. Portman is very gifted, but her performance here is erratic.  I'll blame Lucas for that.

One is an out of money noble man (Johnny Lee Miller) and the other a thief (Robert Carlyle).London and the aristocracy aren't painted too nicely in Plunkett & Maclean which is interesting when you consider how the Mother Country is portrayed in most costumed dramas of the Merchant\/Ivory type such as Howard's End, and in view of the fact that this was the environment from which many present day Australians emerged during the convict days.Even Port Arthur must not have seemed too bad to some of our convicts compared to the way they were treated in England if the scenes in Plunkett & Maclean are accurate!The film begins with an exceedingly violent and nasty series of scenes involving death, disembowelment and grave robbing which quickly segue into a superb dance scene which throws swinging techno dance music onto a minuet! See it to see what I mean. Never has the ironic use of music been more effective in film.Unfortunately director Jake Scott, son of Ridley and nephew of Tony doesn't keep a firm hand on Plunkett & Maclean. The film vascillates between the disgusting to the bizarre in it's first hour or so, both of which are entertaining, but then takes a somewhat serious turn as the authorities get closer to the quarry.For one wild moment it even seemed as if Plunkett & Maclean might contain serious political comment but it veers away hardly noticing and then one of the boys gets caught.In the midst of all of this is Liv Tyler who's a bit of a love interest for Miller but she never ascends beyond being an annoying, underwritten (ornament?) for what ended up being and annoying underwritten film.Plunkett & Maclean probably needed a lighter touch. If ever a film needed to remain exuberant this was one, if only because it did the early bouncy bits much better.The boys were both interesting (is Robert Carlyle even bad in a film?), the girl was a waste of celluloid and where is that fast forward button when you need it.

Isn't it strange that a lot of masterpieces are made in times of such strife (see Apocalypse Now, Easy Rider, The Shining and The Exorcist.)Yes, I said masterpiece. At first I didn't think it was either. A good film, maybe even a great one, but a masterpiece? Never. The Directors Cut did nothing to change my opinion when it was first released. Now it's easily my favourite science fiction film and quite possibly the finest film that deals with the meaning of identity ever made. Especially the D.C.The script may have been written and rewritten but lets face it, it was worth the wait. There are so many marvelous lines and wonderful scenes it boggles the mind. Hampton Fanchers original draft was okay but it was never as good as David Peoples re-write. The script also hints at deeper meanings behind the obvious. When Batty says Show me what you're made of what exactly does he mean? Is it a straight challenge or a reference to Deckards origins?That's a matter I could never resolve. Is Deckard a replicant? When I watched it the first time there was never a moment I doubted his humanity but after reading other peoples views I find it harder to stick to that. Maybe I'll never know. Maybe Ridley Scott didn't want us to. Scott's touch is undoubtedly the guiding light behind the film. The themes and techniques he used in Alien are exploited here to the full. Syd Mead may have designed that horrible city of the future but Scotts lens never quite manages to damn it. He gives the cold streets a dangerous, foreboding look but finds time for great warmth as well in Deckards apartment. He's helped by Vangelis' marvelous score which fills every scene with such emotion and power it's impossible not to be moved.Harrison Ford may hate the film, Sean Young may have hated working on it but there's no doubt that they and Rutger Hauer give career best performances. It's such a shame that Young and Hauer went into a career nosedive after this that neither have recovered from. The rest of the cast do their jobs admirably as well but Ford comes up trumps. Forget Witness, the Star Wars' or anything else he's done. This is as good as he's been.Perhaps the best way to judge a films affect on the industry is to see how many times it's been imitated. How many times has BladeRunners view of the future been ripped off? Too many. How many have looked as good? With the exception of The Matrix (maybe), none of them. BladeRunners most famous aspect is it's cynical view of what the metropolis will look like once we're finished wih it. But it's not its best. It's the way it constantly questions what being human is and what humans are meant to be and humans are meant to do that I love so much. In this film man plays God by creating a being in its own image. Man wants to control the being. The being does not want to be controlled. It retaliates. Is this a moral or a warning? Like the rest of the film Scott doesn't answer, just lets us draw our own conclusions.Enough. I've gone on far too long. But I could go on forever. Maybe one day I'll right an essay on the film. Or maybe I'll just watch it instead. Yeah, I'll probably just watch it. After all, it is a masterpiece. And the Directors Cut is the best.

I sensed that the film may have tried to setup an underlying theme of racism as perhaps another reason Jackson's character is betrayed by his friends and doesn't trust the courts, but perhaps it's just me.  In any case, the confrontations with the police and hostages become sillier and sillier when you realize that this man is trying to prove his innocence.Jackson and Spacey make a good duo.  They should find a less absurd movie vehicle to work together in.  Just for their performances, I'll give this movie a C.

Breathtaking chases and high speed rides on powerful pod racers; the magnificent views and buildings in the galactic cities; the innocent and majestic queen, cowardly opponents, scheming politicians; the military might, innumerable troops and spacecraft, and great daring which wins an unexpected victory for the few against many. There is friendship and love, resolution and hesitation, hope and despair - a set of emotions to suit almost anyone willing to look beyond the surface. But that is only the beginning of the true movie.It is really simple - the way it happens.  First time, you go and see the characters; since you are not familiar with the plot you listen to the things they say; you watch the things they do.  You watch the background carefully and duly notice all faults which make themselves obvious.  In the end, as the main ideas of the movie become known, you are still weighed down by the burden of the characters and the things they said; the situation is an exact equivalent for 'not seeing the forest for the trees'.Personally, I do not like a lot of things about Star Wars.  The characters - or rather the concepts of characters - are extremely unreal, made up only of black or white, with only good qualities or the bad ones; there are no gray areas allowed, as if the doubt and hesitation belong nowhere, on some wayward world far from the real center of things.  The lines they say are really funny and childish; the way things happen - that's another story all together, not even mentioning the possibility of such an amount of bad luck or fortune to all fall on one pair of shoulders in a given moment.But once you saw and noted all those innumerable faults, you need to come back again to see the true meaning of things.  For the meaning lies beyond all the appearances, beyond the grace or lack of it in the things that you see.  For Star Wars is one of the rare breed of movies where the story is so much bigger than any character involved.  No actors however good they are can really add to it; in a way, they just provide the background on which the fundamental ideas and challenges appear before us.  And that is why, whenever you come back to the movie, you are not seeing the bizarre creatures, or annoying puppets, or childish lines and concepts on screen; what you are seeing is the reflection of that battle of good and evil as it takes place in your own imagination, in all its glory and magnificent detail.You see things the way they should be if it was your world to rule; you see things as they are now and imagine how things would change.  You imagine this character do this, and that character to do that; and there is always room for more, as the concepts become multidimensional and characters come to life - the way you imagine them.The movie earns its biggest praise for supporting this state of mind; it always provides a drawing board, where the characters are never fully complete; there always remains an area of doubt or mystery, never to be shown, always imagined and so endearing. A good movie deserves to be watched twice.  Probably this is all one needs to say to the people who express extreme likes or dislikes for anything.

However, I do not feel the characters in this movie are unrealistic, as some have complained. I felt the character of Will Hunting, who seems to be the most maligned, was very real.  Maybe the problem is that people have gotten so used to seeing characters who are one-dimensional and non-contradictory, even though this is not what people are like in real life.  Will Hunting is a mathematical genius, but this in no way means that he should behave intelligently in all domains of his life.  Hence, it is not unrealistic for him to behave stupidly when it comes to women.  Nor is it unrealistic for him to work as a janitor.  In my experience, people often do things that could not be predicted from their intelligence or abilities alone.  I myself have done things that I intellectually knew were stupid or detrimental; I'm sure most people have, and a mathematical genius should be no exception.  The character of Hunting struck me very much as a guy who has a problem with sabotaging his own happiness and success, maybe out of fear of greater failure should he put himself on the line.  His amazing abilities do not necessitate that he have a good job and a university degree, because it is not just intelligence that determines these things.  In school, perhaps he skipped all his classes and never did his assignments, and thus got poor grades.  That being the case, he would not have been accepted to a prestigious university, and in fact no one might have noticed his affinity for math.  It is also possible he simply didn't apply to university, even though he might have been accepted, either to stay with his friends or to prevent academic failure.  I think one of the points of this movie is that being gifted does not by itself make you happy and successful.  Being gifted does not make you immune to psychological problems, or make you behave in an intelligent manner in all situations.  If his character had been written this way- well, first off, there wouldn't be a movie.  Secondly, that would have made his character completely unbelievable.  I do concede that the likelihood of a genius being a janitor is not that great, but it is not impossible, and I'm sure it happens.  There are historical figures that we now recognise as great, even though in their time they were ignored or ridiculed for their beliefs.  There are also nutty geniuses, who cut off their ears and what not.  In light of such things and of my own personal experiences, I don't see any reason why Hunting can't be as screwed up as the rest of us.

However, I do not feel the characters in this movie are unrealistic, as some have complained. I felt the character of Will Hunting, who seems to be the most maligned, was very real.  Maybe the problem is that people have gotten so used to seeing characters who are one-dimensional and non-contradictory, even though this is not what people are like in real life.  Will Hunting is a mathematical genius, but this in no way means that he should behave intelligently in all domains of his life.  Hence, it is not unrealistic for him to behave stupidly when it comes to women.  Nor is it unrealistic for him to work as a janitor.  In my experience, people often do things that could not be predicted from their intelligence or abilities alone.  I myself have done things that I intellectually knew were stupid or detrimental; I'm sure most people have, and a mathematical genius should be no exception.  The character of Hunting struck me very much as a guy who has a problem with sabotaging his own happiness and success, maybe out of fear of greater failure should he put himself on the line.  His amazing abilities do not necessitate that he have a good job and a university degree, because it is not just intelligence that determines these things.
