[{"date":"16 December 2015","score":"","review":" Horror is just one of those genres that get's a pretty bad wrap some days and it's not hard to see why, cruddy remakes, poor acting and sometimes they just feel so unreal they are horrible. Sometimes though horror's come along that not only satisfy those looking for a fright, but also those who watch all kind of films, The Blair Witch Project is exactly that. Of course it was applauded when it first came out for its new take on horror using the hand-held camera and also that it felt much more human than most horror movies that came out in the 90's. It's all about a legend that some kind of thing lives in the woods near Burkitsville (formerly Blair) in Maryland. A trio of students go to search the woods to make a documentary on the legend and well there footage was found a year later and the students have vanished.The film is quite fantastic in the way it sets itself up, it doesn't try to jump into the end too fast and even with an 81 minute run time it never goes too quick. The plot is well crafted as well and the way in which it jumps between shots is good for the story to move along well and nicely, It can have it's periods where you might get frustrated at the pace but in general nearly overall it is timed well. Of course it isn't hard to get hand-held movies like this done on such a low budget and you can't expect much from this in terms of spectacular things but my word does it not need much of a budget. The creepy feel the people behind this give is spine tingling, never revealing anything properly and always the film uses the dark to great effect.The people behind this are Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez who direct and write this and do a fine job, sure everyone especially when it came out heralded the hand-held camera which is great but also these two get things like sound, colour and just generally the whole feel of the movie is spot on. Myrick and Sanchez create a script that has some nice dialogue too, it's the kind of dialogue that most horror movies need the stuff that actually sounds normal and not cheesy or lines that are way over dramatic. The cast are pretty solid too and of course being unknown it has the element of realism in there, of course after leaving the town and heading to the woods you only really see these three characters so the people playing them had to be picked just right and they are, they are likable and at the same time can be unlikeable and that really shows how the characters change as the plot goes along. The Blair Witch Project isn't something I think all horror fans will like with it's hand-held feel and not a lot of horror that's right in your face, but it works mostly in it's way that is leaves you quite literally in the dark at times. It's spooky and there aren't many more words to describe this movie than that, even when things going on aren't necessarily creepy, you still look around those woods as if something will come out at any moment. In fact watching this I even got to looking into the woods from the very first second they step foot in them, as if expecting some sort of weird thing to come out any second, but if you haven't seen this, you will see what happens.

This is something that I don't agree with, for reasons I will come to. However although there are a handful of faults with the film, it is still a worthy sequel and one of the finest Universal classics.These include the various monster rampages - as good as ever - and of course the creation scene, which is even bigger and better than the original creation. Kites fly, electricity crackles, sparks rain down, and the Bride is raised up into the sky on rickety metal poles. It is certainly a spectacular moment in an exciting, action-packed film. However the most heartfelt and moving scene of the film is when the Monster visits and befriends a blind hermit. The hermit's kindness even causes the Monster to shed a tear, and the scenes where he learns speech are genuinely warming, but in the back of the mind we always know that this is going to come to an end, and soon it does, when hunter John Carradine (in an early bit part) comes in and starts shooting.The actors are great once more, and the cast list can hardly be bettered, with Colin Clive, back from the original FRANKENSTEIN, once more playing the tormented scientist, and gin-sipping Ernest Theisiger (THE OLD DARK HOUSE) as the truly evil creator this time around, his haggard features and slightly insane hair perfect for the role of the weird scientist. Valerie Hobson is a beautiful Elizabeth, and the one character who is totally good in the film. Dwight Frye is again on hand as a monstrous assistant who this time gets thrown off the battlements for his troubles after taunting the Monster with a burning torch (you thought he would have learnt from his previous encounter). Elsa Lanchester is effective in her dual role as Mary Shelley and the Bride itself, and the latter performance, although brief, is excellent. Boris Karloff plays the monster once again, and in some scenes (such as the aforementioned blind hermit one) he conveys pathos brilliantly. However this time around he has been taught to speak and this invariably lessons some of the horrific impact he had the first time around, but being a sequel this was to be expected anyway.The only bad acting in the film comes from an old woman who acts as a comic interpreter, and this is the film's main weakness the reliance on comedy instead of horror for entertainment. If I wanted to watch comedy, I would pop on a Laurel and Hardy film, but instead Whale includes lots of humorous narrative and events, mainly at the beginning of the film, and once again this really lessons what should have been an atmospheric build-up to the horror. However, in a film that has miniature people in jars, a singed Monster roaming woods and graveyards and an electrically-charged ending, you can't really go too far wrong. THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, Whale's last horror film, is yet another Universal classic and a worthy sequel which develops nicely upon the original concept and remains hugely entertaining, even to this day&#x85; We belong dead!.
