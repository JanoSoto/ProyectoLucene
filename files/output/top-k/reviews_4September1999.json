Seeing as I usually enjoy good films instead of Hollywoodised screentrash, I watched Go and was extremely impressed with the film.I went in not knowing a thing about the film, aside from the fact that it had a young cast and had fast cars and the like.  What I got was so much more than that.The structure of the film, and how it all meshed together, was very well written.  It was refreshing to see another good film that takes a few detours in getting from start to finish.  The directing of the film was brilliant - considerably better than Swingers, which I also consider a good film.The acting was done well, the characters played exceptionally.  Sarah Polley played her role fantastically, it is almost a shame that the structure of the film kept her out of a decent amount of it.The combination of humour with drama (for instance, the scene where the guy was whacked and thought the cat was telepathically talking to him) was highly entertaining to watch.  The down moments were brilliant also, the contrasts resulting in a thrill ride that made me come out of the theater saying how cool it was to my friends.It can be likened to Pulp Fiction (although Pulp Fiction has to surpass it in my eyes, it is a classic) and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also by its subject matter and structure, but all three are different films.  Not to take anything away from Go though, it was excellent.Oh, and I was so certain the cop was gay (and I also suspected he would do something bad to Scott Wolf and Jay Mohr, a la Pulp Fiction) but the end result was far worse!  Such a funny twist!  That the two guys turned out to be gay instead was the perfect irony.Good screenwriting, great acting, top directing, all made for a great film.  Totally recommended!

I had no idea what I was getting into. . . . It ROCKED! Do you know what was so exceptional about this movie? It was about a jock who was actually smart and a pretty girl who actually had morals and standards. When it came out on video, MY MOM even LIKED IT! Freddie Prinze Jr. is gorgeous (some guys think he's weird looking, but they're just jealous. What guy wouldn't be ate up over a 6'1, latinian hottie? I mean, come on!). Anywayz, I'm so glad this movie was a hit because this teen flick was actually deserving! So what if the story has been done before? As long as it was done well. Ya know why some people didn't like this movie? Because they didn't use the F word every three seconds and there wasn't any disgusting bathroom humor like there was in There's Something About Mary. A movie can be good with out being vulgar!

She does evil so well (refer to The Witches). Anyway, I waited with baited breath for the film to come because I had a feeling it would be great; but I thought it was going to be a Disney production (like what they did with the live-action 101 Dalmatians) and I thought that they were going to make Ms. Huston be the main attraction.

When I finally saw it, I found that it was one of the best films I ever saw. And I was proved wrong about it being a chick flick - there was more guys in the theatre than girls. Drew Barrymore does the best acting of her career, Anjelica Huston is top notch, and everyone else also turn in exceptional performances. One complaint - why no Oscar nominations?

It had a lot of promise, especially due to the talented young actors who star in it.  But overall, I deemed it nothing really special, just relatively average.  Take the main character, played by Rachael Leigh Cook.  When she was initially presented in the movie, I saw no need for her to be transformed at all.  She is a thoughtful, creative person who has found a way to avoid peer pressure and become pleased with herself as a person.  Do we really need to see this tired formula again?

A lot of the characters I found very annoying, such as Jodi Lyn O'Keefe and Matthew Lillard, those who I'm sure are capable of much better material in the future.  The few things that I did enjoy about this movie were the chemistry between Cook and Freddie Prinze, Jr. as well as the excellent dance sequence to Fatboy Slim's The Rockefeller Skank.  To sum it all up, this movie definitely isn't the worst movie that I have seen, but I would certainly put many more on the top of my list in front of it.

This was the case with Chill Factor but this movie wasn't as entertaining as I thought it was going to be.The story revolves around a military science experiment that goes bad. The Major in charge of the experiment is held responsible for the disaster and is thrown in jail for 10 years. Flash forward 10 years and the Major is released from jail only to be extremely bitter towards the government and attempts to exact vengeance by stealing the chemical weapon that was developed during that experiment to sell to the highest bidder. In walks Skeet Ulrich and Cuba Gooding Jr's characters. They are a couple of ordinary guys that invariably get mixed up in this mess and what ensues is a plot line about a group of renegade mercenaries, lead by the Major, who chase down these two Joes to get these chemicals back.The plot line is somewhat similar to another movie, The Rock. Despite that, I do have to say that the performances that Ulrich (who looks amazingly like Johnny Depp) and Gooding Jr. give are quite good, especially Gooding Jr's. He tends to dominate the scenes that he is in purely on the fact that he makes the most with what he is given. This is definitely the sign of a good actor. Also, the constant bantering between him and Ulrich is quite humorous and the chemistry between the two actors is very evident.The special effects are also fairly well done and if you like explosions, there are plenty of those. Being billed as an action flick, the movie definitely follows the action flick formula of plenty of explosions, lead characters fighting against ridiculous odds, some gruesome deaths and eye catching stunts. It also means that the plot leaves a lot to be desired. Some of the dialogue is just not very good, especially the ones delivered by the villain (Peter Firth). At times, I found the dialogue so filled with cliches that it was annoying. It got to the point where I knew the line before it was spoken. Now, mind you, I realize that with action movies, this kind of corny dialogue is going to happen but at least make an effort to come up with something somewhat creative. Also, the premise that a couple of ordinary guys could outsmart a group of professionally trained soldiers is a bit hard to believe.Overall, if you check your brain...and your vocabulary at the door, you will find this movie entertaining. Gooding Jr. and Ulrich hold this movie together and make it a satisfactory action movie....6\/10.
