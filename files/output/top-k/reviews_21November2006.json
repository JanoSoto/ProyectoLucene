It is where I always wanted to live as a kid. Some people here were impressed by the fact that they made an OZ movie dark and scary, but by making scary, they miss the whole point of the OZ books. I don't even care as much about the stupid mistakes like making Mombi and Princess Langwidere one person. They were both villains and I don't love that, but okay I accept it. I thought that the Judy Garland version butchered the OZ series as much as humanly possible until this movie came along. At least they got the mood of OZ correct. The plot is that Dorothy's aunt and uncle put her in an institution and she escapes with the help of a mysterious blonde girl. Uncle Henry and Auntie Em would never do that. Even in th Emerald City of OZ, when they are going broke and extremely worried that their niece is going insane, they try to shield her from all the hardship in their lives and tell her to go in the attic and dream and say that she should go to OZ while there is so much trouble. It is nuts to think that they would put her through that. They also messed up my favorite character of all time. Princess Langwidere is vain and silly, but not a malicious, evil character like the one portrayed. At one point, she wants to swap heads with Dorothy, but it is only because she forgot and is wearing her head that is impulsive and has a bad temper. Mombi was a evil, but she wasn't nearly as bad as the woman portrayed. She also had absolutely no connection to the Nome King. He was also silly. He was a villain, but in the books, he is a fat, rolly-polly, little man with a huge belt that turned the entire Royal Family of Ev into ornaments. Not exactly the evilest man in the world. Also, one of the best parts of the series was the second book, where you find out that Mombi turned Ozma into a boy and hid her that way. The mirror thing was just so silly and they took away one of the best twists ever. These books were written during the Depression as a form of escapism. It wasn't dark; it was happy.

Their debut film BLOOD SIMPLE is an exercise not only in people caught in their own traps, but about people armed with a limited knowledge of a situation that is forming around them, and acting accordingly, with truly devastating results. The brilliance of letting us in on what we know, and having the characters act only as to what they know of each other and what they ignore about the other gives it an edge that not many noir movies -- even many classics -- have.We always expect the hero to somehow uncover the ugliness of a situation. We always expect that the woman will be a double or triple crossing femme fatale capable of stopping at nothing to get what she wants. We always assume the cuckolded husband will get his revenge, even if it costs him his own morality. And we always, always assume that the people who are meant to be caught will be.The Coen brothers' BLOOD SIMPLE takes all of the elements of noir and places it neatly on its head while retaining a lush style flooded in ambiance and a tightening noose. True, there is a pair of cheating lovers and an angry husband who suspects as much. His uncovering of the truth leads to his shocking decision of having them killed by the private investigator he's hired to follow them -- with no bodies left behind. What follows, of course, has to be seen to be believed, and frankly, it makes perfect sense even when doing a re-take. Because of what I mentioned -- what the characters know, what they ignore, and what decisions they make, is completely outside plot demands. Such a thing becomes screamingly evident in the movie's final showdown, where the last two people you'd ever expect to make it find themselves pitted against each other, fighting for survival, and the other's obliteration.All of the actors are at their element in this great movie. Dan Hedaya, while playing a man capable of paying a man to get his wife killed, manages to be someone you feel sorry for. John Getz moves effortlessly from romantic lover to someone sick of the horror he's walked into. M. Emmett Walsh runs away with the entire movie in his portrayal of greed personified.

That doesn't make it an entirely bad picture, but it certainly puts a damper on what could have been. Clint Eastwood is an aging thief (he's been an aging something or other for his last 20 movies) who secretly witnesses President Gene Hackman get rough with his mistress. The encounter ends with her being shot by the Secret Service as she tries to defend herself, and the incident is promptly disguised to look like run-of-the-mill foul play. He may be on the outside of the law looking in, but Clint ain't about to let the powers that be get away with this one.The opening 20 minutes of ABSOLUTE POWER are quite suspenseful, bordering on mesmerizing. There we are, trapped in a walk-in, two-way mirrored vault along with our pilfering hero, helpless to stop the horror unfolding just meters away. Eastwood may start out as the bad guy, but his status is quickly upgraded as he flees the scene holding what may be the only piece of evidence that can prove his astonishing observation. From then on we find ourselves rooting him on, even if he is in reality nothing more than the lesser of two evils.What unravels ABSOLUTE POWER is its laziness and improbability. In an attempt to set up one stirring scene after another, the characters begin doing and saying things one would expect of a low-rate Jean-Claude Van Damme movie. A one-dimensionally evil Secret Service man surreptitiously hunkers down in a tall building trying to snipe Eastwood ala Lee Harvey Oswald. A police detective has no problem with Eastwood sneaking around his home at all hours of the night. A three-minute argument by Eastwood's thief is enough to convince the mistress's widower of the involvement of the most powerful man on earth. And to call the ending outlandish and unsatisfying would be a pair of understatements.As well, though it's usually the other way around, ABSOLUTE POWER would have benefited from a longer running time. One comes away with the sense that Eastwood, who also directed, tried to cram too much into too little. The film certainly had the material to go longer, and its compactness gives the whole endeavor a choppy feel at times.ABSOLUTE POWER is a film you really want to like. There is considerable talent involved here, and the movie's heart seems to be in the right place. But like that one photo we all have in our album, this one didn't turn out as good as we would have hoped.

Joe Eszterhas had earlier written the script for a film on the same theme, Flashdance. The two films, however, are very different. Alex, the lead character in Flashdance is a sweet, lovable, deeply religious girl whose dream is to become a ballet dancer. (Jennifer Beals's soft, gentle beauty made her well suited to the role). Nomi Malone in Showgirls, by contrast is a prize bitch, a girl whose motto seems to be (in the words of that eighties pop song) You've got to be a hustler if you want to get on. After hitch-hiking to Las Vegas, she finds work as a pole dancer, but has her eyes on a part in a lavish stage review named Goddess. Of course, she succeeds, and then works her way up to be understudy to the show's star, Crystal Connors. Nomi's main tactic in her rise to fame is to sleep with anyone she thinks can help her, even flirting with the openly bisexual Crystal. That flirtation, however, doesn't prevent her from pushing Crystal down a flight of stairs when she thinks the time is ripe for her to take over the leading role herself.The received opinion is that this is the film which blighted Elizabeth Berkley's career, but I cannot say whether that is a fair assessment, as I have not seen a single one of the thirty-odd films, TV movies and TV series she has made since 1995. However, contrary to received opinion I thought that she did a good job here, putting across Nomi's fierce, aggressive sexuality and her desperate desire for success, however transient and however worthless.One reviewer complains that the show Goddess is so obviously tawdry that he could not imagine why anyone would want to star in it. That is precisely the point. The openly erotic show is, as one character points out, little more than a more expensive, more pretentious version of the sleazy pole dancing which Nomi went in for in the earlier part of her career. There is an exchange in Robert Bolt's A Man for All Seasons when Thomas More asks the treacherous Richard Rich, who has been rewarded for his treachery with a government position in Wales, What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his soul? But for Wales? To paraphrase More's words, what shall it profit a woman if she lose her soul for a part in Goddess? It is a measure of Nomi's desperation for fame at any price that she is willing to do anything to star in such a tacky show; one of the targets of the film's satire is the way in which the entertainment industry exploits some people's insatiable desire for their fifteen minutes of fame. (If anything, that exploitation has become even greater since 1995 with the irresistible rise of reality TV shows). Of course, when one's fifteen minutes are up, disillusionment sets in. There is another nice performance from Gina Gershon as Crystal, a still-beautiful but jaded and cynical thirty-something, who finds it easy to forgive Nomi for pushing her down the stairs; she needs a rest, and the insurance money will come in handy.There is an obvious trap for those making films satirising the bottom end of the entertainment market, namely that of becoming what one is satirising. The Running Man was a film which fell into this trap, and Showgirls does not entirely avoid it. Those critics who took exception to the scenes of nudity probably had a point; Goddess may be tacky, and the pole-dancing even more so, but did Paul Verhoeven really need to show us so much of them in order to make his point? He might want to show us that Nomi has the morals of an alley-cat, but in doing so he also manages to show us that Elizabeth Berkley looks pretty good with her clothes off.The official verdict on this film seems to be that it is trash. That, at least, seems to be the verdict of the critics, of the public who stayed away in droves (it was not a box-office success), of the IMDb members who have given it an average mark of only 3.8, most of the reviewers on this board and of the organisers of the Razzie Awards who voted it not only the worst film of 1995 but also the worst film of the entire decade. (Did they miss The Blair Witch Project?) Liberal critics who would not normally turn a hair at the most extreme sexual perversions seemed to turn into fully paid-up members of the Moral Majority when confronted with the film's nude scenes; Roger Ebert called it a sleazefest and masturbatory fantasy. That's the same Roger Ebert who in an earlier incarnation was responsible for Beyond the Valley of the Dolls.When confronted with such a chorus of disapproval, my normal contrarian's instinct is to try and find something positive about the film. In the case of Showgirls I felt that many critics treated it as a serious drama and missed the vein of satire that runs through it. If one can avoid taking it too seriously, it can be enjoyed as a sardonic expose of showbiz life. It is in many ways a cynical film, but its saving grace is that it is cynical even about its own cynicism. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 November 2006","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Showgirls is a satirical variation on the old theme of a star is born, the young girl who works her way up from nowhere to showbiz glory.

In an isolated part of the bush, Jerboa, (Imogen Annesley) runs away from her stepfather, Thylo, (Max Fairchild) and escapes to Sydney . Spotting Jerboa, Donny Martin, (Leigh Biolos) offers her a small role in a horror movie and start a relationship together. When it's discovered that Jerboa is a marsupial werewolf and pregnant, they all team up to save the group from being hunted to death.The Good News There is a few really nice things about this one. The focus is on its rather intriguing central premise of a specifically Australian colony of werewolves, called were-thylacines, since these are marsupial werewolves. Now, this notion is one of the most creative and original ideas out there, and what merit it has rests largely on the fact that it came up with this outlandish premise and it follows through on it, giving the chance to learn more than they probably ever wanted to know about these kinds of creature. The sequences devoted to them are quite ingeniously written out and paint a fully developed picture of their family life, which goes a long way in here to making the outlandish family life all the more believable. When it decides to go all out, it can deliver some amusing scenes. The transformations done are quite nicely handled, especially the one forced on by the strobbing light nearby. The sequence at the ballerina exhibit is one of the more inventive ideas around and is a full-on cheese scene that plays out wonderfully. The attempts at comedy are also nicely done, as an exchange on a bus gives off a great line, and several lines later on during the werewolf hunt worthy of a chuckle. The most amount of laughs occur due to the film-within-a-film scenes, which greatly pokes fun at the entire werewolf genre with a couple of great moments. There is some rather good things in here.The Bad News There is still a couple of things keeping this down. The most obvious is that the film is way to cheesy to ever take seriously, whether this was intended or not. The werewolves look really terrible, with over-elongated snouts, non-threatening eyes, and more of a dog look to them than anything. The transformations occur in unusual places, but really can't hold up that well and come off very unconvincingly. There's plenty of other examples spread throughout, but those can't be spoiled. The lack of gore is also a big problem, as there's a large amount of bodies knocked off in here and it would've made the film a tad more tolerable had we seen them getting their kills on-screen. The ending chase through the bush is really hard to sit through, when it delves into a large amount of political debate over tolerating the species of werewolves more than the action shown. It's largely out-of-place and slows the movie down when they all go off on those rants when it should've been carrying through on its action scenes which showed lots of potential. Even worse is that it's a message carried out through the film, and really didn't need to be told to us in the manner given in the film. It's also one of the most confusing films around, as it delves into a couple different subplots that are adequately explained, but are not really in the right film. The different subplots aren't necessarily that bad, but only make the film far more confusing than it needs to be. It could've done with scaling a couple of them back or eliminating them altogether. That would still leave the explanation for the werewolves, which is one of the hokiest and most unbelievable ones offered, and is such a giant U-turn from normal werewolf lore that it needs a couple of views to acceptably get it down.The Final Verdict Sure, it's a giant cheese-fest, but there's some good ideas in here that may not be all that original but it at least showed that there was some creativity used in the process. This is still only recommended to the most hardcore werewolf fan though.Rated PG-13 Violence, Nudity, a mild sex scene and some Language ","genre":null},{"date":"21 November 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Howling III The Marsupials is a decent, if unspectacular werewolf film.**SPOILERS**After being transfixed with a video shot by his grandfather years ago, Professor Harry Beckmeyer, (Barry Otto) is asked by the US Government to fly to Australia to investigate a series of werewolf reports with Professor Sharp, (Ralph Cotterill) an old friend and colleague.

In an isolated part of the bush, Jerboa, (Imogen Annesley) runs away from her stepfather, Thylo, (Max Fairchild) and escapes to Sydney . Spotting Jerboa, Donny Martin, (Leigh Biolos) offers her a small role in a horror movie and start a relationship together. When it's discovered that Jerboa is a marsupial werewolf and pregnant, they all team up to save the group from being hunted to death.The Good News There is a few really nice things about this one. The focus is on its rather intriguing central premise of a specifically Australian colony of werewolves, called were-thylacines, since these are marsupial werewolves. Now, this notion is one of the most creative and original ideas out there, and what merit it has rests largely on the fact that it came up with this outlandish premise and it follows through on it, giving the chance to learn more than they probably ever wanted to know about these kinds of creature. The sequences devoted to them are quite ingeniously written out and paint a fully developed picture of their family life, which goes a long way in here to making the outlandish family life all the more believable. When it decides to go all out, it can deliver some amusing scenes. The transformations done are quite nicely handled, especially the one forced on by the strobbing light nearby. The sequence at the ballerina exhibit is one of the more inventive ideas around and is a full-on cheese scene that plays out wonderfully. The attempts at comedy are also nicely done, as an exchange on a bus gives off a great line, and several lines later on during the werewolf hunt worthy of a chuckle. The most amount of laughs occur due to the film-within-a-film scenes, which greatly pokes fun at the entire werewolf genre with a couple of great moments. There is some rather good things in here.The Bad News There is still a couple of things keeping this down. The most obvious is that the film is way to cheesy to ever take seriously, whether this was intended or not. The werewolves look really terrible, with over-elongated snouts, non-threatening eyes, and more of a dog look to them than anything. The transformations occur in unusual places, but really can't hold up that well and come off very unconvincingly. There's plenty of other examples spread throughout, but those can't be spoiled. The lack of gore is also a big problem, as there's a large amount of bodies knocked off in here and it would've made the film a tad more tolerable had we seen them getting their kills on-screen.

We later find out that the calls are coming from inside the house, and that a maniac has been hiding in the children's upstairs bedroom after brutally slaughtering both of them, the police finding him soaked in the children's blood. Seven years later, the maniac who tormented Jill, Curt Duncan (Tony Beckley) escapes from the mental asylum, and begins stalking a woman named Tracy (Colleen Dewhurst) after a violent bar scuffle. Now it's up to Detective Clifford (Charles Durning) to stop Curt before he kills again, and Jill may just be his next target.Unlike the 2006 remake of the film, the original spans over a lengthy period of time (about seven years), while the remake takes place in one evening and just lengthens the first thirty minutes of the original film into one movie. The story for this film is really original and unique - it obviously borrows a lot from the classic urban legend about the babysitter receiving phone calls to later discover they are coming from inside the home - while today that myth may seem overused and clichéd, it's still a really scary concept. The opening for this film was great, and was definitely among the best moments of the movie. Carol Kane plays her part of Jill very well, with a vulnerability and innocence that makes her an easy target for the maniac. Charles Durning is fun to watch as the detective who, seven years after the babysitting incident, helps Colleen Dewhurtst's character when she is stalked by Curt after he is loose from the asylum.The film has a very dark, urban atmosphere throughout most of it, since a large portion of the movie takes place in the inner-city. Director Fred Walton, who later went on to direct the comic horror surprise April Fool's Day does a good job crafting the film - the music is really eerie and the long silences and pauses that are used throughout the film (particularly during the first half-hour) are very effective and appropriate for the movie. And the finale with Jill was very well done, especially the final scare that occurs in her bedroom - I should have known that was coming, but it was so cleverly written that it came out of nowhere for me. Definite kudos on that.Bottom line - When A Stranger Calls is a scary, entertaining thriller that kept me interested the entire way. Unlike the remake that relied mostly on jump scenes and cheap scares, this film is very well crafted and much better. I easily prefer this version over the remake. If you want to see a serious, good thriller, this film is perfect. 8\/10.

While downstairs doing homework, she begins to receive bizarre phone calls, and contacts the police. We later find out that the calls are coming from inside the house, and that a maniac has been hiding in the children's upstairs bedroom after brutally slaughtering both of them, the police finding him soaked in the children's blood. Seven years later, the maniac who tormented Jill, Curt Duncan (Tony Beckley) escapes from the mental asylum, and begins stalking a woman named Tracy (Colleen Dewhurst) after a violent bar scuffle. Now it's up to Detective Clifford (Charles Durning) to stop Curt before he kills again, and Jill may just be his next target.Unlike the 2006 remake of the film, the original spans over a lengthy period of time (about seven years), while the remake takes place in one evening and just lengthens the first thirty minutes of the original film into one movie. The story for this film is really original and unique - it obviously borrows a lot from the classic urban legend about the babysitter receiving phone calls to later discover they are coming from inside the home - while today that myth may seem overused and clichéd, it's still a really scary concept. The opening for this film was great, and was definitely among the best moments of the movie. Carol Kane plays her part of Jill very well, with a vulnerability and innocence that makes her an easy target for the maniac.

I may not have given it 10 out of 10 but it is definitely one of Jack's better films. It is so different to anything else he has done before, in my opinion, that some people may not know how to respond but all in all they should watch it anyway, because, more than anything else, it's impressionable and very, very interesting.The character of David Staeblar (Jack Nicholson) comes across as your average, slightly middle-class male, seeming settled in his usual daily routine of life and living comfortably with his grandfather. When he meets up with his ambitious older brother, he seems somewhat disdainful of his pathetic dreams of success in Atlantic City. You never quite understand whether David is dismissing these pipe dreams because he doesn't believe they can happen or because he is slightly jealous of his brother.The film, above all, highlights the relationship between four people, and how they react to each other. The two brothers and the two women. Between the brothers you can sense there is a love there but there is also an underlying current of bitterness and regret, almost as though they were never that close in childhood.Sally (Ellen Burstyn) is clearly in love with Jason but she is also terrified that his 'upcoming success' will leave her out in the cold and, despite coming across as independent and feisty, you can see she is desperately trying to cling on to a stability she craves with him. She wants people to think she's okay but really she craves security. There is anguish and real suppressed emotion there. She was considered beautiful in her day but her looks are fading and she's not getting any younger. She's constantly reminded of that when she looks at her stepdaughter Jessie.

Sydney Pollack's sharp contemporary comedy about gender-bending in a world that values artificiality struck like lightning at the time of its release. It took the premise started (and hinted) in SOME LIKE IT HOT and ran with it. Dustin Hoffman gives one of his immortal performances as the abrasive Michael Dorsey, a man purportedly based on his younger persona, a virtually unemployable actor who just won't take orders, even when playing a tomato for a commercial. Coming upon a casting advert for a role on a popular soap opera and at the edge of desperation for a job, Michael takes a big leap and decides to apply -- except that the role is meant for a woman. Dressed to the nines as Dorothy Michaels (something of a reverse form of his own name), he manages to win the part (even when it's a guest spot, slated to end after a short appearance). As Dorothy, however, Michael creates a vibrant character and his part is expanded, mainly due to Dorothy's unwillingness to play her role by the rules. Such a bold move -- which includes Michael's disdain for his director (Dabney Coleman) who insists on calling Dorothy Tootsie -- has raised ratings and thus created a media frenzy over this strangely empowered woman. Julie (Jessica Lange in an equally textured performance), a co-star, becomes Dorothy's friend and confidant.In the meantime, where Dorothy is gaining a cyclonic force, Michael's life is unraveling. His girlfriend Sandy (Teri Garr) suspects Michael may be cheating on her (since he frequently leaves her hanging), another fellow actor, John van Horn (George Gaynes) has the hots for Dorothy, and Julie's father Les (Charles Durning) has also become enamored of her. Sitting quietly by as the madness takes conscious shape is Jeff (Bill Murray), who is seeing Michael taking his role as Dorothy a little too seriously and stressing over what item goes with what in terms of dressing. Virtually every combination of gender confusion is thrown at the viewer, especially in a virtuoso sequence where poor Michael has to all but perform a miracle in order not to become another statistic on the front page of the New York Post, but when his contract becomes extended indefinitely, he decides he has to take matters into his own hands if he is to have his own life as a man.TOOTSIE is, plain and simple, excellent. It takes its subject matter seriously. Hoffman doesn't play the role like a man playing a woman but a man learning to be a woman and thusly, understanding how they tick, but using his natural abrasiveness to create an assertive female in a world that tends to treat women (like Julie) as submissive objects. His performance is so spot-on that it's no wonder the men in the movie fall for Dorothy he inhabits Dorothy down to her vaguely Southern mannerisms and ante-bellum decorum. Just watch the montage in which Dorothy, now a media sensation, is being photographed in an assortment of outfits. It's what today's premiere drag performer Charles Busch would also do in his performances use the nuances of a strong yet feminine energy to its fullest advantage. (As a matter of fact, Charles Busch himself would play a variation of the Michael Dorsey role in a soap opera.) TOOTSIE is a tour-de-force of Hoffman's acting as he is in perfect control of his character's duality. One of the premiere examples of gender-bending comedies -- VICTOR\/VICTORIA being its feminine counterpart -- this is a movie that paved the way for future incursions into men not just donning women's clothes, but inhabiting a feminine persona.

In CHICAGO he made the sad role of Amos Hart, the man who Roxie Hart famously cheated on and due to some unsavory incidents, became a celebrity. In THE HOURS, he was married to Laura Brown who was reading Virginia Woolf's groundbreaking novella Mrs. Dalloway and who discovered some secret things about herself, things his character, Dan Brown, was unaware of until Laura ran deserted him. And in this movie, THE GOOD GIRL, he found himself again on the receiving end, again caught in a predicament that became too messy for its own good. Justine Last (Jennifer Aniston) is caught in a life she doesn't want, but to which she has acclimated herself to in the Texas town where she lives with her husband Phil (John C. Reilly). She works at a dead-end job in a WalMart-like department store and moves from day to day in a daze. She can't understand the sameness of her situation and why Phil would prefer to hang out with his tick of a friend, Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson), who is always there. The arrival of a new employee, Holden Worther, a kid who keeps to himself, however, changes her life in more ways than one. While initially hostile to each other, she and he strike up a friendship that soon becomes a lot more than that. This is one of the many complications that ensue the story of the ironically titled THE GOOD GIRL, where Aniston's character is anything but. Initially, she is quite sympathetic in her grey character, but when she decides to leave her friend Gwen (Deborah Rush) to die in a hospital because she can't wait to enjoy a little more vapid time with Holden in a seedy motel, her own selfishness comes through. Of course, she does realize that there is little to no future in this affair she is having... but Holden, already an unhinged character, doesn't think so and he sets out to prove it to her. Her need to set things straight gets her in deeper and deeper waters, and at one point, she wonders if murder might be a solution.THE GOOD GIRL is quite a surprise in that like Steven Soderbergh's BUBBLE, it takes a simple situation and has it slowly build up to a point where before anyone can guess where it's going, it's already careening out of control. Placing it in a small town setting enhances the scenario of tension and projected intimacy between its characters. Because in a small town everyone knows each other, there is the constant danger of disclosure, scorn and its aftermath. Justine knows what she's gotten herself into but can't act if not to protect her own marriage. What she becomes aware of is that people in a small town have a mentality where their acquaintance comes with hidden agendas and projected desires, and in no other character can this be better pegged onto like Bubba. As sleazy and dirty as he is, he summarizes his own vicarious enjoyment of seeing the Lasts crumble as a marriage that he has placed in this imagined pedestal he's a friend (if you can call him that), but he also covets. He would want to be the one to have Justine and quietly seethes. Becoming aware of her whereabouts puts him in a heightened position of control, and he enacts all of his desires accordingly, blackmailing Justine while letting her know she can't ever tell Phil.Jennifer Aniston is far from her Rachel character in Friends as Justine. Deglamorized, speaking in a weary monotone, frumpy, walking in a graceless shuffle, she is ennui personified. Jake Gylenhaal is the type of guy anyone with a little intelligence would run towards, and then from he mixes his unnaturally beautiful looks and haunting green eyes with just the right dose of mental imbalance to create an especially intense character. John C. Reilly doesn't have much to do here, but he does has one strong scene that involves restrained violence. Zooey Deschanel has some pat but sharp scenes as a loopy co-worker with a penchant for loudness. All in all this is a quiet little movie that evolves in its own way and has several cards up its sleeve. ","genre":null},{"date":"21 November 2006","score":"","review":" In one year alone, John C.

In THE HOURS, he was married to Laura Brown who was reading Virginia Woolf's groundbreaking novella Mrs. Dalloway and who discovered some secret things about herself, things his character, Dan Brown, was unaware of until Laura ran deserted him. And in this movie, THE GOOD GIRL, he found himself again on the receiving end, again caught in a predicament that became too messy for its own good. Justine Last (Jennifer Aniston) is caught in a life she doesn't want, but to which she has acclimated herself to in the Texas town where she lives with her husband Phil (John C. Reilly). She works at a dead-end job in a WalMart-like department store and moves from day to day in a daze. She can't understand the sameness of her situation and why Phil would prefer to hang out with his tick of a friend, Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson), who is always there. The arrival of a new employee, Holden Worther, a kid who keeps to himself, however, changes her life in more ways than one. While initially hostile to each other, she and he strike up a friendship that soon becomes a lot more than that. This is one of the many complications that ensue the story of the ironically titled THE GOOD GIRL, where Aniston's character is anything but. Initially, she is quite sympathetic in her grey character, but when she decides to leave her friend Gwen (Deborah Rush) to die in a hospital because she can't wait to enjoy a little more vapid time with Holden in a seedy motel, her own selfishness comes through. Of course, she does realize that there is little to no future in this affair she is having... but Holden, already an unhinged character, doesn't think so and he sets out to prove it to her. Her need to set things straight gets her in deeper and deeper waters, and at one point, she wonders if murder might be a solution.THE GOOD GIRL is quite a surprise in that like Steven Soderbergh's BUBBLE, it takes a simple situation and has it slowly build up to a point where before anyone can guess where it's going, it's already careening out of control. Placing it in a small town setting enhances the scenario of tension and projected intimacy between its characters. Because in a small town everyone knows each other, there is the constant danger of disclosure, scorn and its aftermath. Justine knows what she's gotten herself into but can't act if not to protect her own marriage. What she becomes aware of is that people in a small town have a mentality where their acquaintance comes with hidden agendas and projected desires, and in no other character can this be better pegged onto like Bubba. As sleazy and dirty as he is, he summarizes his own vicarious enjoyment of seeing the Lasts crumble as a marriage that he has placed in this imagined pedestal he's a friend (if you can call him that), but he also covets. He would want to be the one to have Justine and quietly seethes. Becoming aware of her whereabouts puts him in a heightened position of control, and he enacts all of his desires accordingly, blackmailing Justine while letting her know she can't ever tell Phil.Jennifer Aniston is far from her Rachel character in Friends as Justine. Deglamorized, speaking in a weary monotone, frumpy, walking in a graceless shuffle, she is ennui personified. Jake Gylenhaal is the type of guy anyone with a little intelligence would run towards, and then from he mixes his unnaturally beautiful looks and haunting green eyes with just the right dose of mental imbalance to create an especially intense character. John C. Reilly doesn't have much to do here, but he does has one strong scene that involves restrained violence. Zooey Deschanel has some pat but sharp scenes as a loopy co-worker with a penchant for loudness. All in all this is a quiet little movie that evolves in its own way and has several cards up its sleeve.
