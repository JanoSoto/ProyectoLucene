He's got the look, the money, the power; his manner of speak, drawling, unwaveringly masculine, suggests more heroic brawn than quick-witted brains.

There probably isn't a better type of movie hero, unless we're talking about an unheard of one like Lisbeth Salander. Then we're talking.For now, though, I'll settle (sporadically, that is) for the bonkers fun of Big Trouble in Little China, which is partially a comedy, an action movie, a kung-fu flick, a distant cousin of Indiana Jones, a labyrinthine fantasy. It's uneven to say the least (we can agree that the action is terrific, yes, but what about the film's all-too-obvious inability to develop its characters?), but there is plenty of enjoyment to be had, so long as you leave your logic and bitterness at the door and turn the word improbable into likely. Because Big Trouble in Little China is like Danger Diabolik &#x97; you either figure it to be Mystery Science Theater 3000 worthy or an irresistible exercise in pulp insanity. Personally, I'd go with the former.Much of the ruckus in San Francisco's Chinatown has to do with Jack Burton (Kurt Russell), a quasi-macho truck driver who finds himself in a pit of trouble after his best friend's (Dennis Dun) green-eyed fiancée (Suzee Pai) is kidnapped by a Chinese gang. The gang, however, isn't your run-of-the-mill pack of bandits looking for trouble because it's fun &#x97; they, in actuality, are the henchman of Lo Pan (James Hong), an ancient sorcerer seeking marriage to a green-eyed Chinese girl in order to bring his aging body back to youthful flesh and blood.Fortunately, the film doesn't sabotage itself with unneeded side plots or drivel pieces of dialogue needed to explain outrageous events. It's a chase movie with Hong Kong action movie instincts, going out to save a kidnapped girl and concluding by saving the said girl. The supernatural elements of Big Trouble in Little China are entertaining in a low-budget, 1940s B-movie kind of way, and the fight sequences are impressively choreographed. John Carpenter, having a ball, keeps things visually scrumptious, the tone matching in its manic gusto. Russell is perfect for this kind of material, charmingly bumbling, crafty when it comes to quick escapes and logistical battle tactics. Funny is the way Dennis Dunn's kung- fu master character is the real hero of the movie, though Russell, being 1986's present-day John Wayne, is too big-headed to notice. Kim Cattrall makes for a spunky love interest.But I suppose Big Trouble in Little China's biggest problem is how weightless it is, how nothing feels as though things are really at stake. Because the screenplay develops its characters by introducing them and not much else, we hardly get to know them, deciding who we like simply based on the power of their one-liners. The plot is rather been-there- done-that, despite the masterful telling of it all, and the supporting performances from Lo Pan and company are never quite campy enough to shape them into the Bond-esque villains they set out to be.

MARNIE is somewhat of a departure in the type of film he had made his name doing, but even so, it contains themes that resonated through his body of work. The story is about Marnie (Tippi Hedren), a compulsive thief and liar who ends up marrying a man she robs. This was an intriguing premise, to say the least, and provided the opportunity for Tippi Hedren to play a more complex character than she had in THE BIRDS, but I don't think she was quite up to the task. Sean Connery was appropriately dashing in his role as Mark, the man she ends up falling for, but he didn't really have that much chemistry with Hedren, in my opinion. For me, there were individual moments or flashes of brilliance that worked rather than the film as a whole. In particular, the opening sequence where we are introduced to Marnie was well-done, and the scene where she robs Mark's company was the closest the film ever came to capturing the suspense for which Hitchcock is so well-known. The rest of it was a mixed bag. Some of the psychological elements were interesting by themselves, and in a few scenes, were well-utilized. However, the sledgehammer approach to Freudian themes and associations removed a lot of the mystique. It also didn't help that the explanation for Marnie's particular idiosyncrasies at the end was rather unsatisfying. Still, there were a number of things I did like. Tippi Hedren played cold and calculating rather well. Bernard Herrmann's score and main theme was very romantic and fit the character of Marnie. The film was also handsomely photographed, had great sets and costumes, and made good use of color. Overall, though, I feel like MARNIE has some poor pacing, is a little too long, and has as much trouble identifying what it wants to be as Marnie herself. Before I watched this, I took a look at the theatrical trailer, and even Hitchcock had difficulty (it seems) really pinning down what the film was (settling on 'sex mystery'). Certainly one of Hitchcock's lesser efforts, it still has some interesting parts despite the unevenness of it all.

Army-brat sisters Regina (Catherine Mary Stewart) and Samantha (Kelli Maroney) are apparent lone survivors left to fend for themselves in a deserted and dangerous Los Angeles.One doesn't expect much from a film like this going in, one of Night Of The Comet's secret weapons. Another is the genre- twisting Consider it Planet Terror meets Thelma And Louise with a John Hughes rewrite in there somewhere. Director Thom Eberhardt employs a formula exemplified by a graffito we see in an alley during an early brawl Entertainment Or Death. There's a lot of death in this movie, an entire city's population at the very least, yet it's entertainingly delivered, with tongue always in cheek. Yes, you have a good deal of suspense, and some scares, but mostly you have mordant moments like when Regina is trying to tell Samantha what happened to their wicked stepmother by shaking a dusty blouse she scoops off the lawnI'll show you Doris! Here's Doris!If you can't laugh at something like that, you are watching the wrong movie.Both Stewart and Maroney are superb in giving you a rooting interest. Reg is the older, hyper-competitive teen, who can't bear the idea of someone else cutting into her list of top video game scores. Sam is a Valley Girl who still wears her pep-club togs and cuts a dance move after knocking down an armed adversary. While Robert Beltran is first-billed for contractual reasons, he actually plays a character more interesting for the rivalry he prompts in Reg and Sam as the last man on Earth than what he brings to the table himself. (He does have a funny scene trying to outrun a kid who has been turned feral by the comet.)Great support is given by Geoffrey Lewis as a menacing scientist and Mary Woronov as his conscience-ridden assistant. My favorite character is a leering ex-stock boy named Willy (Ivan E. Roth) who takes over a mall with his goons and sees the comet as his ticket to the capitalist dream Now we own the store! The American way!The movie suffers from a weak resolution of the scientist situation, the only time the plot seems labored. One also wishes at times for more chances for Reg and Sam to use their automatic weapons, especially when Sam squints like Clint Eastwood discharging her MAC- 10. There are times L.

In order for an epic to succeed, it has to hold the viewers' attentions throughout the film. Of course there can be moments of down time, but every movie has that. Lawrence of Arabia not only holds attention, it feature everything to make a great movie at all-time heights.Lawrence of Arabia is easily the best movie made about the First World War. Being the best epic is arguable, but there's only a margin of movies about WW1 and none are simply better than this. Newcomer Peter O'Toole is dead-on as Thomas Edward Lawrence--a role many people say he should have won for instead of Gregory Peck in To Kill a Mockingbird. If O'Toole did win, the backlash would be the same. I personally liked O'Toole and Lawrence of Arabia more. Lawrence is a hip and cool soldier who wants adventure and is assigned to help Arabian tribes face the Turks. He unites the different tribes and leads them to victory. Throughout the movie are beautiful images of the sun clearing the sky in the deserts of the middle-east with glamorous music. Watching this movie is like looking at an ocean sunset. No matter how many times you see this or how bored you get, you will not be able to take your eyes off this. Anybody that does not like this obviously misses the underlying themes and characterizations. As I mentioned, O'Toole is captivating. But everybody else is amazing too. Alec Guinness plays Bedouin Prince Feisel who was actually mistaken by residents for the real prince. Lawrence is a complex, multi-layered character who is one of cinema's all-time greats. He is a rebellious misfit who brings his theories with him to Arabia. Seeing it is his biggest challenge, he tries to become one with the army while still keeping his own self. Lawrence is an idealist. When he turns out to be a success, he lets it all get to his head and his ego grows. He unites the tribes and leads the men in courage than only he could give. We understand why Lawrence becomes vain, but still want him to keep his general humility. When a tragic situation changes his whole perspective, he wants out but his influence brought them far. That is where the themes of inspiration and leadership\/influence really soar. Despite a terrible trauma to him, he still stepped up with the aide of people he once inspired to fight. He gained everybody's loyalty and friendship--two crucial things the movie is about. Just one man whom everybody doubted created such a bang and legacy that forever changed history. When the war finishes, unity breaks with disagreements but there is still some peace among the groups. I found that to be realistic instead of a picture- perfect happy-ending where everybody becomes best friends. I wouldn't say Lawrence of Arabia is sad entirely, there's just one depressing scene. But it is not happy either. It is all fully realistic and we have characters and situations where we can be proud of.

The central protagonist here is Tom Reagan (Byrne), who is the closest adviser of the big political boss in town, the vivacious Leo (Finney), who not only controls the police, but also the various mafiasos in town. One of them, run by the eccentric Italian Johnny Casper (Polito), is angry at Leo over the proposed assassination of a little gangster rat, Bernie Bernbaum (Turturro), who just happens to be the brother of Leo's girl, the tough-talking Verna (Harden). In the opening scene, Casper asks Leo to have the chiseling Jewish bookie killed, but Leo won't budge. This is partly because Leo doesn't want to let the uppity Caspar get his way. In the meantime, unbeknownst to Leo, Tom is screwing Verna on the side.However, Tom fails to keep things from escalating, as we soon find him and Leo at odds over her, and Leo kicks Tom out of his job. Subsequently, he crosses over to Casper's side, apparently in the hope of entrenching himself high up in the trust of the city's new mob boss, but it's immediately clear that whatever game Tom's playing, Caspar's success and well-being are of only incidental concern. As the film goes on, Tom tries to manipulate everything, but towards the middle of the film, rats on where Bernie is, and finds himself with the task of shooting him at Miller's Crossing. Here's where the big twist lies, and it sets the stage for the rest of this film, which reaches a fateful conclusion.Miller's Crossing attempts to both sum up, and revivify, the gangster genre. Guns, booze and fast women - all timeworn gangster film clichés are given a fresh twist in this masterpiece from Joel and Ethan Coen. The Coens' play this icy gangster tale mostly straight, but they can't help throwing in a few of their dark, comic explosions; it's one of their best, most cohesive films and it holds up to repeated viewings. There's not a false move, a bad angle, an awkward line or a wanting performance at any point in their fascinating tale of gang warfare, family loyalty, personal loyalty and homo-erotic bonding set in some peculiarly insular, corrupt, never-identified small town in 1920s America - a sardonic neo-noir gangster story with a wicked sense of humor and unfettered violence. Capping the beautifully layered storyline is a barrage of wonderful performances from everyone, like Gabriel Byrne's wonderfully stone-faced performance, hiding himself under his facade; Marcia Gay Harden showing a different side of the traditional mob moll; John Turturro's wonderfully energetic performance; and, of course, Albert Finney brilliantly portraying Leo as not being a monster, but really being a tough but gentle man.A gleeful riff on a very old genre; the Coens make Miller's Crossing sing anew with wit, intensity, and irresistible black humor, thanks to a screenplay of pure gold. I still think it's the best Coens' film yet!

The premise is really the only interesting aspect of Leviathan, while the special effects, story line, and character development are lacking in quality. First, the SFX of this film are truly sub-par. Even though I understand the limits of practical effects, the effects in Leviathan are not convincing at all, and the designs are poor and lifeless. Compared to similar films, such as Alien (1979) and The Thing (1982), the special effects come off as cheap. This pulled me out of the film every time I saw the ridiculous lumbering mountain of wet rubber that was the ultimate monster. Second, the story line is basically a rehashing of Alien, expect taking place on Earth. It borrows heavily from The Thing as well, which all three have the archetypal scifi-horror story of finding a horrible creature trapped for eons, that is freed and subsequently wrecks havoc on the human characters. This in itself not a huge issue for me, but Leviathan added no interesting twist on this template, it just filled in the blanks. Third, the character development remained a low priority on the filmmakers mind. The characters are flat, and expendable.

(I wasn't too keen on opening scene, but glad I persevered)Many race movies (possibly made by white people) have simplistic themes, such as whites don't like blacks of course sometimes things are that simple and those movies need to be made too, but seeing a movie made by someone black meant that complexities are raised that would perhaps never occur to white people, eg problems between black people because they perceive another being too light or paradoxically too black. Every relationship is poisoned with paranoia because no one knows if they are genuinely interested in the other or whether their unconscious agenda is what is making them go with someone of a different colour , ie is a black man who wants to date a white woman or light coloured black woman trying to go up in the world, or the reverse does a white person dating a black person just doing it to be exotic or rebel. Even the seemingly societally acceptable relationships eg black with black maybe have an agenda too, maybe they are merely trying to keep the sisterhood\/brotherhood together. In the end race has got everyone so mixed up and poisoned that no one really can know if their love is truly genuine or just a reaction to the racist society we live in. This movie gave me a powerful and sad insight into what it must be like to be a black person, in a world where people are classified by colour (although that of course is the other irony that is raised in this movie because if someone's parent is white and the other black what colour do you classify them?) Not that white people don't have their own inter race dating issues, e.g. upper class dates lower class, Irish dates English, Protestant vs Catholic, etc, but it's not the same. Of course Spike Lee is just one black filmmaker so I don't know if other black people agree with him or not, this is why there should be more filmmakers of different races\/sex etc, so we get more than one inside perspective. Malcolm X is another movie that affected me deeply, and gave me a different but also powerful insight, more polished movie actually due to obvious bigger budget, but anyway that's a topic for another day.There are a number of themes in this movie, so many in fact that I am just touching the surface, drugs, religion, poverty, and I haven't even talked about the Italian part of it, but surprisingly it all gels and does not seem disjointed, in fact all the themes flow together. There are also issues about what well meaning white people do and how that can actually endanger a black person (e.g. the police scene-this scene made me cry), and that even if a white person\/policeman etc is not racist, the problem is black people have to be on their guard because they don't know which ones will be.SPOILER A few people have mentioned that this movie is against inter racial relationships saying stick to your own but I'm not sure it is, after all the point is made that very few of the characters are completely black anyway. And in fact the main characters wife is mixed race. It is clear to me though that Wesley Snipes true love was his wife, although there is some true feeling between him and the Italian girl most of it is curiosity and lust, so yes he should have stayed with his black wife (who is actually half white anyway!). However the movie shows there is a real possibility of real and lasting love in the budding romance between Italian Paulie and the black lady because the first thing he says to her when he asks her out is I find you intelligent before he tells her he also finds her attractive. So his main attraction is based on her mind, not looks (so therefore not her colour) Actually it occurred to me it is very rare that a man ever says to a woman in a movie that he wants to date her because she is intelligent. It's interesting how often people are attracted to different races, because they look exotic, I have pondered if this is essentially racist, because surely attraction should come from personality not the colour of someone's skin, but perhaps it is no less shallow than be attracted to someone because they are pretty. I think also though perceived difference can spark attraction because you grow and become more tolerant from learning about another culture, and dating between races is the ultimate way to do that. On the other hand people you may initially be turned on by the colour of someone's skin, but once you get to know them if there is true compatibility there you really don't notice this after a while because they just become a person that you know you really love because they are a kindred spirit. Actually the irony is the most disappointing thing you can discover from loving someone of a different race is that actually they are just a human being like you and therefore not so excitingly different or exotic after all!

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"13 August 2015","score":"","review":" I knew this moment would come, and that I'd eventually find a Hitchcock film that I didn't care for too much. TORN CURTAIN, while certainly topical in its examination of Cold War politics, nuclear secrets and double agents, largely fails to do what every other Hitchcock picture I've seen so far has done, i.e., be entertaining. Granted, there are a few sequences that recall classic Hitch, but they are barely enough to distract from how dull this was to get through at times. In what would be his last usage of marquee talent, Paul Newman and Julie Andrews star as a couple of scientists who publicly defect to East Germany at the height of the Cold War in order to gain access to an important formula or nuclear secret. Honestly, as the film's MacGuffin, this piece of information doesn't really matter (to the audience, at least). And that's fine. However, matters aren't helped by having such weak characters despite being capably played such talented actors and Newman and Andrews. Even the chemistry between them was barely better than Connery and Hedren in MARNIE. There was also no memorable villain. Still, at the risk of beating down too much on the film, there were a few sequences that I will probably remember for while. The best of these happens close to halfway in, and involves a tense brawl between Newman and an East German agent who has gotten onto his secret plans. It plays out sans score, and was incredibly tense. Towards the end, there was also a bus-riding sequence and a scene in a theater that recalled the climax to THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. It wasn't as good as the former, but still stood out. If there's one thing that's sorely missed, it's Bernard Herrmann as composer, here replaced by John Addison. I did like a number of the cues, but I can only imagine that Herrmann's score would have been much better. Even so, I liked the jazz-inflected touch that Addison brought to the material.

TORN CURTAIN, while certainly topical in its examination of Cold War politics, nuclear secrets and double agents, largely fails to do what every other Hitchcock picture I've seen so far has done, i.e., be entertaining.

The best of these happens close to halfway in, and involves a tense brawl between Newman and an East German agent who has gotten onto his secret plans. It plays out sans score, and was incredibly tense. Towards the end, there was also a bus-riding sequence and a scene in a theater that recalled the climax to THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH.

","genre":"Thriller"},{"date":"13 August 2015","score":"","review":" This famous screen adaptation of James Goldman's play is mostly remembered for Katharine Hepburn's historic third win of Oscar's BEST LEADING ACTRESS in 1969 (yet she would further cement her unrivalled record with her fourth win for ON GOLDEN POND, 1981, 8\/10), most interestingly, it is the one and only case where it is a tie for leading actress, she shares the honour with Barbara Streisand in FUNNY GIRL (1968). Directed by Anthony Harvey with Goldman as the screenwriter, headlined by O'Toole and Hepburn, well, contrary to my expectation, it comes out as a rather enervating and mind-numbing non- starter. So it all happens during Christmas 1183, King Henry II of England (O'Toole), convenes Queen Eleanor (Hepburn), whom he has imprisoned for months in a castle, and their three sons, Richard (Hopkins), Geoffrey (Castle) and John (Terry) to Chinon, Anjou for a family reunion and to discuss the issue of heir-ship, with King Philip II of France (Dalton) as their guest, and also presented is Alais (Merrow), Henry's mistress and Philip's sister, who is betrothed to Richard. That being so, it forges a cobweb of stakes around them while all the three princes contend to be crowned the future king, Richard is championed by Eleanor and John is Henry's favourite, while Geoffrey has his own calculations.Yet all the relations cannot be simply divided by love or hate, being a sterling dramaturge, Goldman maps out an intricate love-and-hate struggle between almost any two random characters, at first, it is relishing to enjoy these top players mount their mélange of feelings through their eloquent oration and wordplay, but being a different art form from a dialogue- driven play confined in a simple locale, the film version tries to duplicate the same pathos using the same method, soon the narrative steers towards excesses, there is no time for audience to ruminate the bombard of colloquies, in the next scene, the same power struggle\/psychological game repeats itself between other characters, at the end of day, after all the labouring bickering, the status quo remains unseated, from choosing the right heir, to threatening of dethroning Eleanor from the title, to the extreme of murdering all his sons for the sake of marrying Alais and they can start life anew, the script is overwhelmingly rich for its 134 minutes running time, nonetheless the final upshot proves all above is merely lip service, no exciting changeover presented, all we know is for medieval people, their mouth never match their heart, it is a rather exhausting anticlimax and doesn't sharpen the process of character building. Hardly one can blame it on the cast, all is busting their asses to construct the atmosphere of dramatic intensity, even for Hopkins, Dalton and Terry (who just passed away earlier this year at a quite young age of 69), in their screen debut. Hopkins possesses a wide-eyed earnestness which is very rare in his staple phenotypes. Dalton is fiercely wet behind the ears in front of Hepburn and O'Toole, alas their undercurrent of homosexuality only superficially touched on. Terry is deliberately grotesque, Castle preserves a distinctive but untapped inscrutability and the Golden Globe nominated Merrow cannot remotely match two top-billers' expertise. Hepburn's magnificent spirit is perpetually something to shout about, so is O'Toole's frenzied outbursts, for whom we all have a soft spot considering his ill-fated Oscar journey (8 nominations with zero win), alas, neither her nor him can hold the top spot in my book for this lines-laden period elaboration. Reckoning its higher rating elsewhere and an extolled reputation, this is another specimen where a dissonance existing between one's personal view and the accepted general opinion, being a non-radical and rational film reviewer, not so often this occurs to me, so although being slightly disappointed, personally I feel delightful to retain one's own differences once in a while.
