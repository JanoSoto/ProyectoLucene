Charlie still preferred a protracted sight gag to 2 pages of scripted jokes.The project had started out to be a Talkie, but somewhere between the start of the shooting and a dispute with his Leading Lady,Virginia Cherrill, the plan was revised in favor of the old way, the method that the Chaplin Company knew and even had been innovators in so many aspects of the Siilent Form.Following his tradition as a sort of Traditional, Classic Story Teller, his cast is credited with portraying characters with no names. The credits in CITY LIGHTS, as in so many of his films up to the 1st true Takie, THE GREAT DICTATOR(1940).The story in a nutshell takes us to the City, any Metropolis would do. The city scape looks much like a huge tank of tropical fish, with the various inhabitants scurrying to and fro, going to thousands of destinations, all moving at variable speeds. The fellow next to you is barely visible to you as you are to him.On occasion, usually quite by accident, two of our urban denizens collide one way or other, and things slow down enough for some meaningful interaction.The first such occurrence happens when The Little Tramp meets up with a beautiful, young Flower Girl(Leading Lady, Virginia Cherrill), who he soon discovers is blind. Because of the proximity of some Limoseines, the Girl mistakenly believes Charlie to be a Rich Millionaire(and that's the best kind!) The Tramp is obviously smitten by the Girl, and his heart also sympathizes with her affliction.A chance meeting with an intoxicated Millionaire(Harry Myers), who befriends The Tramp, and is his best buddy. There is nothing that he won't do for Charlie, unless of course, he is Sober! When the Millionaire is not under the influence, he does not know the Tramp, nor does he remember whatever promises he made to him! Following a meandering odyssey of menial jobs and incidents follow, in which Charlie both helps to support the Girl and her Grandmother, but at the same time, has hopes of saving up money enough money in order to send her to Europe and a cure for her blindness! In getting the money, The Little Tramp winds up in prison for a Robbery. Once released he is back in the City, where he again meets the Girl.It is at this point that Chaplin gives us his most unusual ending, is not one of the most different wind ups in film History. (If you don'y know what I'm talking about, JUST SEE IT!!) All of this serious talk might lead one to think that there is no humor here. Far from it, as we have a most impressive array of out and out comic action and great gags ever seen, and together in one movie! A few good examples (without giving it away)follows 1. The opening scene of an Official, White Tie Dedication of a new piece of Public Art*, a new Sculpture in a City Park. 2. An extended bit of interplay between Sanitation Department Street Sweeper(Charlie) and some large animals. 3. The Boxing, the Prizefight between Professional Boxer, (Hank Mann)and the Little Tramp! (about the funniest thing on the screen!) This is one rare Movie, being so well liked by the Public and the Press Boys alike! When the people(Box Office)meets such as written by the Movie Critics(The Film as Art), we are left with a truly, one of a kind only, Comedy Masterpiece.THANK YOU, SIR CHARLES, and may THE LITTLE TRAMP Rest in Peace.NOTE * Which reminds me QUESTION What is the difference between Obscenity and Art?ANSWER A Federal Grant! (I know it's not germane to the discussion,but the Art reference brought it up in my mind.)

Liberty Vallence is the movie that tells this transition from a brutal period, where strength is everything, to a civilized period, where the law primes on force. Lee Marvin is Liberty Valence, the symbol of this brutal force of the West, and James Stewart, the Pilgrim, is the other side of the time  the law. But the transition from one to another needs a mediation, that will bring the biggest Western star, John Wayne, how embodies Tom Doniphon, the man who'll make the changes possible, by using force in order to civilized the West.Ford gives a strong an wise look to this period, in a melancholic movie, that paradoxically explains that there is nothing to regret from the changes and the disappearance of a certain idea of the world. But the characters can't help thinking that they probably missed something, that their lives could have been very different. The movie is very modern, the biggest part of it is a long flashback. James Stewart, who's now a important senator, comes back with his wife to a small village apparently full of memories. They're here to assist to the funerals of an old friend  Tom Doniphon. But their presence here surprises the local journalist, that asked James Stewarts for explanations.

But, as the journalist finally said in a very famous sentence   This is the west, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend. The last half hour of the movie is definitely the best, all the contradictory feelings are present, and the final duel is most impressive, beautifully filmed in Black and White photography. The twist at the end is unseen in Ford other's movies, and proves that he was still able in 1962 to direct a personal and original movie, even with the old star John Wayne, even in Black and White, even with the same narrative codes he uses since more than 30 years. This movie is still surprisingly interesting and complex, if you can see through its classicism.
