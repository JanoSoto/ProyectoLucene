[{"date":"19 May 2010","score":"","review":" The first time I saw this 1999 comedy was in late 2001, when I saw it at school. I could clearly remember that first viewing, but couldn't remember the title of the movie, nor did I recognize anyone in it. I wouldn't have recognized Steve Martin at the time, but am surprised I didn't recognize Eddie Murphy. Sometime within the past six months or so, I came across the IMDb page for Bowfinger, and it wasn't long before I could tell what it was. When I discovered that, I intended to watch it again, and did just that this week. I knew it was nowhere near being one of the most popular comedies of all time, but it had reasonably wide appeal, so I was expecting a movie that would make me laugh (can't remember how funny I found it the first time), even if it wasn't totally consistent with the humour, and for the most part, I was pleased.Bobby Bowfinger is a struggling wannabe filmmaker who is now 49 years old and still trying to make a movie and get it released. For most of his life, he has been saving money for production costs. When he receives a silly sci-fi script entitled Chubby Rain, written by an accountant named Afrim, he thinks it's a great script and is determined to make a film out of it, so he invites Afrim over to his house and rounds up a cast of several wannabe movie stars, a camera operator named Dave who can borrow equipment from the studio he works at, and a crew from Mexico. Bowfinger goes to meet a studio executive named Jerry Renfro, who agrees to distribute the film, but only if Hollywood mega-star Kit Ramsey has a part in it. After Kit refuses the role, Robert K. Bowfinger decides he will have his cast act out their scenes in the mega-star's presence, without him knowing he's in the movie, while the crew hides with the camera and films these scenes! The cast is convinced that Kit does know he's in the movie but is method acting, and they are not to speak to him outside their scenes.The title character in his flick is played by Steve Martin, and the comedian certainly shows his talent here. Not only did he star in this comedy, he also wrote it. Eddie Murphy plays two characters here, the self-centred, arrogant, paranoid Kit Ramsey and his goofy, nerdy identical brother, Jiff. These two characters differ greatly from one another, but Murphy is very funny in both roles! The cast is mostly strong, also featuring Adam Alexi-Malle as Afrim, Christine Baranski as Carol (a member of the Chubby Rain cast), Terence Stamp as Terry Stricter (Kit Ramsey's councilor), etc. Heather Graham is not a very good actress, but I think even she has her moments here in the role of Daisy, another member of the cheesy movie's cast. Bowfinger may seem somewhat bland around the beginning, and only moderately funny at best for a while, but that changes. The movie is not entirely consistent, but there are so many funny bits of dialogue, and also really funny parts showing the process of Kit's scenes being filmed (with the other cast members playing their roles and the big star's reactions to them), and eventually Jiff doing his part for Bowfinger's project. The gags are enough to make this comedy funny for the most part, sometimes even hilarious! If you like the 1994 Tim Burton movie, Ed Wood and its premise, Bowfinger might be another film for you to check out, even though one difference between the two is that is that this one is not based on a true story.

The premise of the story is about a young man (if you can even call him that), who finds a need to get attention from his mother. In efforts to do this Harold falls deeply in love with a 79 year old woman named Maude. The character of Maude is played by Ruth Gordon, who goes about life as though life is a day by day thing. The viewers first meet Harold at the beginning of the film where Harold (Bud Cort) stages his own death with one of his many odd and morbid unsuccessful suicides. The movie opens up with a nameless person's feet and legs walking down a spiral staircase to a LP record player that starts to play a Cat Stevens song, which soon becomes the one of the theme song for the entire movie. The nameless male figure (Harold) puts a noose around his neck and kicks the chair that he is standing on out from underneath himself. The music cuts out and Harold's mother comes in to find Harold hanging himself. It's these acts that lead to Harold's mother to send him to a therapist. We learn very little about Harold until in one of his sessions his therapist asks him what he likes to do for fun. To this question Harold simply replies that he likes to go to funerals. The next scene is Harold at a funeral where he and the viewers get introduce to Maude. The two together seem like such an unlikely pair it makes you won't them to work out. Well watching you can't help but think that the relationship is strange and a bit unconventional, you really don't care. The characters are so strange and so far from what people think is normal and boarders on the clinically insane. It seems that every angle of every shot has a meaning behind it or something to silently show you. On one of the scenes Harold is on a date that is mother has set up for him on the internet. The way that its shot holds Harold's mother and his date inside the house in a sitting room waiting for Harold to come and join them. Harold is caught threw the window dousing himself with what we assume is gasoline, and then lights himself on fire to his dates horror. Harold comes in seconds later as his date runs out of the room screaming. It's this scene that shows the meaning between the frames so to speak, Harold looks at the camera in a very somber pale face that slowly turns into a slight grin. This shows the great acting ability and relationship between the actor(s) and the director. This scene is quite funny but its also shows Harold's need for attention from his mother. In another scene Maude and Harold are sitting on an old pier looking at a fair across the water. As Harold and Maude talk the camera shows a quick shot of Maude's wrist. On her wrist there are numbers tattooed on it. This insinuates that she spent time in a concentration camp, which could explain her unusual ways. The relationship between the 79 year old women (Maude) and Harold seems strange to most audiences across the board but that's what makes the journey more powerful and heartwarming. The lessons that are taught through this movie are hidden by the witty lines and the crazy actions between these two characters. This lets people that wont something to do on a weekend watch a movie and enjoy it, as well as the people that are looking for a deeper meaning and understanding. In essences this is a movie for all people.

The very well developed script was written by Colin Higgins. Ashby's movie stars Bud Cort as Harold and Ruth Gordon as Maude. He set the movie in the San Francisco Bay area. Harold And Maude is a good movie it shows how one person can impact another's life and change how they view it while using sound effects and editing clips as well as the characters working through a well developed plot making it easy for the viewers to understand. Harold is a young boy who is 19 years old who seems to be depresses about life and becomes obsessed with death. He buys a hearse which his mother does not like the idea of. He has multiple fake attempts at suicide to get his mothers attention as she is always busy doing something else, the last three of his attempts are done to get rid of the many his mother sets him up in because she thinks they could be his potential wife. During one of the fake attempts he is in a sitting room with his mother and one of his potential date. While his mother and date are talking he pulls out a meat clever and precedes to use it like he is chopping of his hand. Even though it was a fake hand his date was freaked out by it and hiss mother seemed to be in disbelief while being mad at the same time. Harold's last three attempts were done to get rid of the dates his mother set him up on while the ones in the beginning were to get his mothers attention. The change in why he was doing them was due to meeting Maude who is a 79 year old women at one of the many funerals he attended in his free time. Maude then takes Harold through many things that teach him to look at life differently. Such as when they stole multiple vehicles all while taking the tree from the city and putting it in the wilderness as Maude thought it was going to die. By the end you can see he has changed when Maude said she had taken pills and is going to die and instead of Harold letting her die he has her rushed to the hospital in hopes of keeping her alive.Sound effects are one of the greatest things about this movie. It is often used to set the tone and atmosphere while developing the character and furthering the plot. One place where this is greatly used is during one of Harold's fake attempts he is in the living room with one of the potential wives and she asks about the knives that are sitting on the table next to them. He says he will show her what it does and lays down a mat while Japanese music is playing in the background showing his focus. He them pretends to stab himself in the heart and die. While the women thinks he is being serious she then recites a few lines from The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet before taking the knife out of Harold's hands and killing herself as she thought he had. Another great example of his is during the final credits when the movie ends. It ends with Harold walking away playing the banjo all while in the background you can hear a song playing saying you can do what you want and change it yourself. It shows how Harold got a new look on life and now perceives it by the words in the song.The editing in Harold and Maude was also done very well to help further the plot and the dramatic effects and feelings of the characters. Many of the shots are panned to get the full effect while following the characters or objects in them to show the true emotions and how the characters moved. It also gives the viewer a better understanding of the location and what is happening as they see the character moving to that location. For instance when Harold has Maude brought the hospital it switches between the long walk shown in the hallways of the hospital which felt like they took forever, because they were trying to show how long it. felt to Harold where every second counted towards Maude's life. In between the long walk in the hallway it also shows Harold's drive to his final attempt at suicide, where he was upset about Maude and war driving to fast and not safely. Another good place where this is used is when Harold and Maude are in the junk yard and the camera starts out at a farther distance and slowly moves into Harold and Maude talking while moving in we see Maude has numbers on her arm which signify she was in a concentration camp when she was younger and once again show she is an older women. Also after Harold tells Maude he likes her while they are there the camera angle changes again so you can see them and the fireworks that are taking place by there side. The fireworks are put in to show that they are at the climax of the movie through fireworks representing celebration and the end. Harold and Maude is a well devolved movie and is very worth while watching. It shows how life lessons can be taught in such little ways and how one person can change another's view on life. It also does a very good job at developing characters and moving the plot along.

It shows how Harold got a new look on life and now perceives it by the words in the song.The editing in Harold and Maude was also done very well to help further the plot and the dramatic effects and feelings of the characters. Many of the shots are panned to get the full effect while following the characters or objects in them to show the true emotions and how the characters moved. It also gives the viewer a better understanding of the location and what is happening as they see the character moving to that location.

Another good place where this is used is when Harold and Maude are in the junk yard and the camera starts out at a farther distance and slowly moves into Harold and Maude talking while moving in we see Maude has numbers on her arm which signify she was in a concentration camp when she was younger and once again show she is an older women. Also after Harold tells Maude he likes her while they are there the camera angle changes again so you can see them and the fireworks that are taking place by there side. The fireworks are put in to show that they are at the climax of the movie through fireworks representing celebration and the end. Harold and Maude is a well devolved movie and is very worth while watching. It shows how life lessons can be taught in such little ways and how one person can change another's view on life. It also does a very good job at developing characters and moving the plot along.

The very well developed script was written by Colin Higgins. Ashby's movie stars Bud Cort as Harold and Ruth Gordon as Maude. He set the movie in the San Francisco Bay area. Harold And Maude is a good movie it shows how one person can impact another's life and change how they view it while using sound effects and editing clips as well as the characters working through a well developed plot making it easy for the viewers to understand. Harold is a young boy who is 19 years old who seems to be depresses about life and becomes obsessed with death. He buys a hearse which his mother does not like the idea of. He has multiple fake attempts at suicide to get his mothers attention as she is always busy doing something else, the last three of his attempts are done to get rid of the many his mother sets him up in because she thinks they could be his potential wife. During one of the fake attempts he is in a sitting room with his mother and one of his potential date. While his mother and date are talking he pulls out a meat clever and precedes to use it like he is chopping of his hand. Even though it was a fake hand his date was freaked out by it and hiss mother seemed to be in disbelief while being mad at the same time. Harold's last three attempts were done to get rid of the dates his mother set him up on while the ones in the beginning were to get his mothers attention. The change in why he was doing them was due to meeting Maude who is a 79 year old women at one of the many funerals he attended in his free time. Maude then takes Harold through many things that teach him to look at life differently. Such as when they stole multiple vehicles all while taking the tree from the city and putting it in the wilderness as Maude thought it was going to die. By the end you can see he has changed when Maude said she had taken pills and is going to die and instead of Harold letting her die he has her rushed to the hospital in hopes of keeping her alive.Sound effects are one of the greatest things about this movie. It is often used to set the tone and atmosphere while developing the character and furthering the plot. One place where this is greatly used is during one of Harold's fake attempts he is in the living room with one of the potential wives and she asks about the knives that are sitting on the table next to them. He says he will show her what it does and lays down a mat while Japanese music is playing in the background showing his focus. He them pretends to stab himself in the heart and die. While the women thinks he is being serious she then recites a few lines from The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet before taking the knife out of Harold's hands and killing herself as she thought he had. Another great example of his is during the final credits when the movie ends.

The movie kept me constantly waiting for something that just never happened. The movie feels like one big build-up to nothing.It will really be the horror-fans that will be most disappointed and displeased with this movie. There are not enough killings or other defining genre moments in it and besides when the killings do occur it feels very sloppy and the blood and gore is disappointing. In my opinion the killer seems more like a slapstick character at times.The movie makes some wrong and uninteresting choices with its build-up. The character development just feels uninteresting and also unnecessary. What you want from a slasher are some killings and preferably some gore and creativity to go along with it all. This movie just keeps building up and developing. It plays on the idea of presenting as many different character in this movie as possible, who potentially could turn out to be the killer. Of course nothing wrong with this idea and it gets used quite a lot but when nothing is happening you just couldn't care any less for who will turn out to be the killer. The movie just never gets tense or scary. Think you can blame inexperienced director Paul Lynch for just not handling the genre very well. It's an early '80's movie, that in its style foremost still feels like an '70's flick. It uses some fancy editing and there were some nice moments in it, which kept the movie going. The movie unfortunately also prominently features some disco music and some disco moves from all of the cast members. The kind of moves that are just too embarrassing to look at now days.The story also feels quite messy, aside from the fact that it just isn't a very interesting or even remotely original one. Lots of the characters just feel very random and only seem to be put in the movie to serve as potentially suspects for the killer role. I just don't get it for instance what the roles of the cops are in this movie. They are lurking around everywhere all the time but doing nothing at all.But well, it still has scream-queen Jamie Lee Curtis in it, so how bad can it actually be, you might think. It really is an irrelevant fact that Jamie Lee Curtis is in this though. She gets nothing interesting to do. Same goes for Leslie Nielsen and all of the other actors in it. Nielsen probably still gives the best performance out of the entire movie and it made me wish he was more in it. It made me wish as well that he made less comedies and played more serious roles throughout his career.

Harold is a boy about nineteen and is played by Bud Cort. Maude is a woman about 79 years old and is played by Ruth Gordon. The movie is set in the San Francisco Bay area. Harold is a boy who is depressed and attempts many times to get his mothers attention by pretending to commit suicide. Since Harold is depressed and attempts to kill himself he likes to attend funeral in his spare time. That's where he meets Maude. Maude may be 79 years old, but she has a lot of spunk. She is like a life lesson teacher and does a lot of things that are against the law. Some of the things she and Harold do are steal a car and tree, and then when the police pull them over they steal the motorcycle.

Every time Harold meets a new girl he does something immoral to get the girls to leave because he doesn't want to be with them. Harold falls in love with Maude and wants to marry her. The day of Maude's 80th birthday Harold purposes to her and then she tells him that she is going to die because she took pills. I think this movie is good and there are a lot of things that keep the audience entertained. The things that stand out the most and make it a good movie are Harold's suicide attempts, Maude and Harold's relationship and the lesson Maude teaches Harold.One of the big things that makes me say it was a good movie was the suicide attempts Harold does. The special effects are really good and it makes it look like Harold really dies. There are a few that stick in my mind the most. One is when Harold is on one of his meetings with a girl names Edith from the dating service. Harold doesn't really want to deal with her so he does things that he shouldn't to get rid of her. He pretends to cut off his hand. It really looks like it happened because you can see the bones and Harold even made noises and faces that make it look real. Another incident was when Harold was meeting Sunshine and he tried to kill himself. She was interested in the knifes that were sitting on a table. Since she was interested he stabbed himself and then she did the same just it wasn't pretend she really killed herself. It looked so real when Harold did it because of the blood and the way he acted. The last one that was really believable and made you think it really happened was that the end of the movie. Harold is driving his car and he drives it off a cliff. All you see is the car hitting the ground and smashing. Then you see Harold at the top of the cliff and then he starts to play his banjo. The stunt crew do an amazing job at making these suicide attempts look so real.One of the things that keeps the audience intrigued is Harold and Maude's relationship. Harold is young and Maude is old so it's a little weird but it adds a lot to the movie. If the movie wasn't like that it would be very boring and wouldn't be as good. Harold and Maude's relationship is what the movie is about. Maude is the one that changes Harold. One of the ways Harold changes is when he purposes to Maude on her birthday and she says she's taken a pill he doesn't let her die he calls the ambulance. If it was anyone else he would have let them die. One of the really weird but funny scene is where Harold is in Maude's bed with her and his is blowing bubbles and you can tell he is shirtless. You don't know that Maude is in the bed till the camera zooms out to a bigger shot and then you see Maude sleeping and it looks like she has her shirt off too. Harold falls madly in love with Maude. He even purposes to her on her 80th birthday. Their relationship is what made the movie and is what kept the audience hooked. The Last thing that made the movie good was the lesson Maude taught Harold. She was like a life teacher to him and she taught him not to get too attached. One of the things Maude told Harold was here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to things. Maude cared about Harold and she knew he loved her but she knew she wouldn't be around forever so that's why she told him that. This lesson isn't just for Harold its for everyone out there. It means don't get to attached to something because it may not always be there. This is what Maude was really saying. It was something Harold didn't really get because he was young and in love. This movie was really good and the one thing that can be taken away is the lesson Maude teaches because its not only a good lesson but a true one. Some things are not always going to be there.You have to not get to attached because someday they will leave.

Harold is young and Maude is old so it's a little weird but it adds a lot to the movie. If the movie wasn't like that it would be very boring and wouldn't be as good. Harold and Maude's relationship is what the movie is about. Maude is the one that changes Harold. One of the ways Harold changes is when he purposes to Maude on her birthday and she says she's taken a pill he doesn't let her die he calls the ambulance. If it was anyone else he would have let them die. One of the really weird but funny scene is where Harold is in Maude's bed with her and his is blowing bubbles and you can tell he is shirtless. You don't know that Maude is in the bed till the camera zooms out to a bigger shot and then you see Maude sleeping and it looks like she has her shirt off too. Harold falls madly in love with Maude. He even purposes to her on her 80th birthday. Their relationship is what made the movie and is what kept the audience hooked. The Last thing that made the movie good was the lesson Maude taught Harold. She was like a life teacher to him and she taught him not to get too attached. One of the things Maude told Harold was here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to things. Maude cared about Harold and she knew he loved her but she knew she wouldn't be around forever so that's why she told him that. This lesson isn't just for Harold its for everyone out there. It means don't get to attached to something because it may not always be there. This is what Maude was really saying. It was something Harold didn't really get because he was young and in love. This movie was really good and the one thing that can be taken away is the lesson Maude teaches because its not only a good lesson but a true one. Some things are not always going to be there.You have to not get to attached because someday they will leave. ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"19 May 2010","score":"","review":" Harold & Maude is written by Colin Higgins and directed by Hal Ashby. Harold is a boy about nineteen and is played by Bud Cort. Maude is a woman about 79 years old and is played by Ruth Gordon. The movie is set in the San Francisco Bay area. Harold is a boy who is depressed and attempts many times to get his mothers attention by pretending to commit suicide. Since Harold is depressed and attempts to kill himself he likes to attend funeral in his spare time. That's where he meets Maude. Maude may be 79 years old, but she has a lot of spunk. She is like a life lesson teacher and does a lot of things that are against the law. Some of the things she and Harold do are steal a car and tree, and then when the police pull them over they steal the motorcycle. Harold's mom sets Harold up in this dating service so he can meet girls his own age. Every time Harold meets a new girl he does something immoral to get the girls to leave because he doesn't want to be with them. Harold falls in love with Maude and wants to marry her. The day of Maude's 80th birthday Harold purposes to her and then she tells him that she is going to die because she took pills. I think this movie is good and there are a lot of things that keep the audience entertained. The things that stand out the most and make it a good movie are Harold's suicide attempts, Maude and Harold's relationship and the lesson Maude teaches Harold.One of the big things that makes me say it was a good movie was the suicide attempts Harold does. The special effects are really good and it makes it look like Harold really dies. There are a few that stick in my mind the most. One is when Harold is on one of his meetings with a girl names Edith from the dating service. Harold doesn't really want to deal with her so he does things that he shouldn't to get rid of her. He pretends to cut off his hand. It really looks like it happened because you can see the bones and Harold even made noises and faces that make it look real. Another incident was when Harold was meeting Sunshine and he tried to kill himself. She was interested in the knifes that were sitting on a table. Since she was interested he stabbed himself and then she did the same just it wasn't pretend she really killed herself. It looked so real when Harold did it because of the blood and the way he acted. The last one that was really believable and made you think it really happened was that the end of the movie. Harold is driving his car and he drives it off a cliff. All you see is the car hitting the ground and smashing. Then you see Harold at the top of the cliff and then he starts to play his banjo. The stunt crew do an amazing job at making these suicide attempts look so real.One of the things that keeps the audience intrigued is Harold and Maude's relationship.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"19 May 2010","score":"","review":" At the age of 60, Alfred Hitchcock decided to go wildly radical after his award-winning big productions. His next film, Psycho (1960), was an independent production whose budget was only 800 000 dollars. Through this Hitchcock was able to make a film, entirely in a way he wanted to but also achieve a naturally mundane atmosphere which was still characterized by psychological and film noir-like elements. Psycho is still Hitchcock's most shocking film and the most influential film he ever made. Just like The Beatles, the death of Elvis and the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so is Psycho a part of the cultural legacy of the 1960's. It marked a turning point in the history of American cinema and changed its being forever reality was now approached in a brand new way, through a Hitchcockian prism of fear. In the central of Psycho there is a run-down motel which has been left to the side of a new highway a picture of alienation, a system which progresses quickly, neglecting the actual needs of people. The motel is run by an extraordinary man, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who lives alone with his mother. One day Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a woman who has just stolen 40, 000 dollars, arrives to the Bates' Motel. Having disappeared, Marion's boyfriend and sister start to look for her. But Norman isn't too happy about it and tries to avoid their investigation.Like in many films by Alfred Hitchcock, the opening credits of Psycho are extremely important and fascinating. These opening credits were designed by the storyboard artist and pictorial consultant Saul Bass, who had also designed them for The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956). The credits, together with the score by Bernard Herrmann, manage to set out the theme and the topic of the film. The credits are often seen to illustrate the decomposition of the human mind but also the change of order and disorder which is common for capitalist urban life. It is an expression of the new world order.The graphics designed by Bass don't just reign the opening credits they're everywhere in the film. In the beginning, we see the horizontal Janet Leigh and her brassiere, and the vertical John Gavin, completely topless. The geometric polarity of horizontal and vertical lines repeats in concrete forms throughout Psycho for example, the horizontal motel and the vertical Victorian mansion in which Norman's mother lives.Psycho is mundane, or as Michael Schmidt has said Psycho combines wonderfully the everyday and mysterious. But it really isn't a b-movie. For Hitchcock the horror and excitement just happen to arise from ordinary, mundane things. Once again, the opening scene is a wonderful example of this just a conventional, simple scene. Back then, the audience was affected by Janet Leigh's breasts and brassiere which were shown for the first time in the history of cinema but, what is more, the scene is so well filmed that the viewer can do nothing but get identified with the characters. Psycho indeed might just be the most polished thriller ever made. It's perfect, no matter how you look at it.Psycho puts the society to a collision between the shadows of past and presence. It conducted dialog between the old past and trendy presence. In the film, we meet two modern urban clichés a regular office girl and a lonely youngster who also spends most of his time at his office. There is one intriguing scene which is a wonderful example of this an unconventional love scene between two loners which, in turn, conducts dialog with the opening scene now the characters don't talk about money and sex but about loneliness.The way I see it, if Psycho has got a thesis, it must be that fear is in ourselves. Marion is constantly put in scenes with mirrors first in the office, then in the motel etc. The most luminous proof of the nature of this thesis is in the scene where Marion's sister (Vera Miles) scares her own reflection on a mirror -- a brilliant shot which soon became a cliché.In Psycho money isn't really essential. Money is present, all the time, but it doesn't make a difference -- it is insignificant. Hitchcock obviously wanted to show money just as a part of the society. It is a part of the air we breathe, so to speak. However, Psycho does also talk more widely about consumer society. A good example of the consumer culture is the scene where Marion quickly changes her old car to a new one. Even if her motive was to get away from the cops, the scene doesn't just talk about her personal hurry but about the social hurry inside us all. Psycho talks about the American society and about the transition, in the 1950's how it turned from the conservative to more and more liberal in the 1960's but at the same became more alienated and anguished.I'm sure I could go on and on about Psycho but, unfortunately, there are limitations. To put it briefly, Psycho is one of the best American films ever made and its aesthetic, cultural and sociological influence is undeniable. Many have spent thousands of words just talking about the architecture of Psycho how the mansion represents the Freudian psychic apparatus (id, ego and superego) and how much influence Hitchcock took from an American painter Edward Hopper (take a look at The House by the Railroad). Together with Michael Powell's Peeping Tom (1960), Hitchcock's Psycho opened the gates for the graphically clear treatment for violence. However, it is much more of a film about our world than violence. Psycho is all about an example of voyeurism and alienation but, in reality, the criticism hits the whole perverted culture and society. Its mundane, Freudian horror is straight from this world and those who criticize it for being horrible, actually criticize their own existence and twisted world.

Set in San Francisco Bay area in the early 70's, Harold and Maude tells the story of Harold, a friendless, troubled, rich boy who is desperate for his mother's attention. This all changes when Harold meets Maude, an unconventional older woman, who becomes his friend, love interest, and mentor. At first the film, written by Colin Higgins, struck me as being very odd. After all, the story of a 19 year old boy who repeatedly fakes suicides, drives a hearse, and who falls in love with a 79 year old eccentric woman wouldn't be considered normal by most. However, despite its unusual plot, Harold and Maude is an entertaining movie with lessons on life and living it to the fullest, friendship, and love&#x85;if you can get past the 60 year age gap between the two characters.The opening scene at first seems tragic. To the tune of Cat Stevens, Harold seemingly hangs himself in his ritzy California home. When Harold's mother discovers him, she ignores him and makes a phone call. These mock suicides, which happen a total of seven times throughout the movie (though Harold tells his psychiatrist he has done this about 15 times before), are all dismissed by Harold's mother, although they are an attempt for her attention. Harold seems to live a sheltered life, and is very quiet; his mother is not concerned with what he wants, as demonstrated in her want of Harold to join the military, or for him to get married. Cort's acting, which is characterized by little facial expression and an awkward manner contrasts with the acting of Gordon, who is boisterous, with exaggerated movements and tone of voice to portray her unusual character. The two form a friendship after meeting at a funeral; a friendship that consists of car stealing, visiting cemeteries and junk yards, spending time at Maude's train car home, and tree replanting. Most of the humor in the movie comes from wacky antics they do together. Cat Steven's If You Want to Sing Out is the song that Maude seems to live by, as she does whatever she wants (even if it's illegal), and becomes the theme of Harold and Maude's relationship.Interesting camera angles are used in unique ways throughout the film, adding to the films overall mood. At times, Harold adds a comical mood by staring directly into the camera, as if he and the audience are in on some inside joke, such as after he sets himself on fire in front of his first date. Moving shots also add to the humor, especially in the pool scene, where Harold has apparently drowned himself. After a shot of Harold, we get a shot of his mother walking to the pool. The shot follows his mother, until the audience discovers the two characters are in the same pool. Many shots focus on one aspect of an object, and then move to show the whole object, such as the front of a car or the light of a motorcycle. These odd shots add to the overall effect of this funny film.Overall, Harold and Maude is an entertaining and unconventional movie, which teens and adults alike can enjoy. While the idea of Harold and Maude's love still creeps me out, it's not enough to say the movie is bad, though it still seems unrealistic at times. The trick with Harold and Maude is to see past the unexplainable fake suicides, stunts, and nontraditional love, and take in what the movie is trying to tell you to live life to its fullest. No matter your take on the movie, its theme of living and being yourself is something that everyone can appreciate.

Set in San Francisco Bay area in the early 70's, Harold and Maude tells the story of Harold, a friendless, troubled, rich boy who is desperate for his mother's attention. This all changes when Harold meets Maude, an unconventional older woman, who becomes his friend, love interest, and mentor. At first the film, written by Colin Higgins, struck me as being very odd. After all, the story of a 19 year old boy who repeatedly fakes suicides, drives a hearse, and who falls in love with a 79 year old eccentric woman wouldn't be considered normal by most. However, despite its unusual plot, Harold and Maude is an entertaining movie with lessons on life and living it to the fullest, friendship, and love&#x85;if you can get past the 60 year age gap between the two characters.The opening scene at first seems tragic. To the tune of Cat Stevens, Harold seemingly hangs himself in his ritzy California home. When Harold's mother discovers him, she ignores him and makes a phone call. These mock suicides, which happen a total of seven times throughout the movie (though Harold tells his psychiatrist he has done this about 15 times before), are all dismissed by Harold's mother, although they are an attempt for her attention. Harold seems to live a sheltered life, and is very quiet; his mother is not concerned with what he wants, as demonstrated in her want of Harold to join the military, or for him to get married. Cort's acting, which is characterized by little facial expression and an awkward manner contrasts with the acting of Gordon, who is boisterous, with exaggerated movements and tone of voice to portray her unusual character. The two form a friendship after meeting at a funeral; a friendship that consists of car stealing, visiting cemeteries and junk yards, spending time at Maude's train car home, and tree replanting. Most of the humor in the movie comes from wacky antics they do together. Cat Steven's If You Want to Sing Out is the song that Maude seems to live by, as she does whatever she wants (even if it's illegal), and becomes the theme of Harold and Maude's relationship.Interesting camera angles are used in unique ways throughout the film, adding to the films overall mood. At times, Harold adds a comical mood by staring directly into the camera, as if he and the audience are in on some inside joke, such as after he sets himself on fire in front of his first date. Moving shots also add to the humor, especially in the pool scene, where Harold has apparently drowned himself. After a shot of Harold, we get a shot of his mother walking to the pool. The shot follows his mother, until the audience discovers the two characters are in the same pool. Many shots focus on one aspect of an object, and then move to show the whole object, such as the front of a car or the light of a motorcycle. These odd shots add to the overall effect of this funny film.Overall, Harold and Maude is an entertaining and unconventional movie, which teens and adults alike can enjoy.

Not so much that the material gets too dark- this isn't Sunset Blvd after all- but just enough so that you and I know who the devil made it. It's a story of a girl, dreamy-eyed Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn), a chauffeur's daughter, who has had a crush on one of the two brothers of a prestigious\/wealthy family on Long Island all her life. But she is sent off to France to learn how to cook, and she returns as a strikingly beautiful woman to the brother David, who before saw her as just the chauffeur's daughter. But before he can toss away his (next) marriage on Sabrina- not to mention a merger of a plastics deal- the older, loner brother Linus who runs the company, wants to try and sway Sabrina from being with David... and in the process falls in love himself.There is the romance, and the comedy, but also a firm study of class. It's interesting that it's Sabrina's father, Thomas Fairchild (John Williams) is even more opposed to her daughter dating a Larrabee than the patriarch Larabbee is. Why can't she just become a cook, he says, and be apart of that class? The patriarch has his concerns as well, but even Linus, after a momentary look at David thinking what are you doing dancing with Sabrina realizes David should be able to whatever he pleases - It's the 20th century after all, he says. To which the father responds, Why, I could pick a century out of a hat, blindfolded, and come up with a better one. And yet for Wilder's commentary, via the original play and screenplay, he also serves up some classic Hollywood escapism. What woman wouldn't want to have a kind of story like Sabrina's where love is just so much in or out of reach as to be unattainable, but things always seem bright (that is unless one has to sail off to Paris all by your lonesome). And Wilder casts just perfectly well to suit the wonderful dialog; Hepburn makes this film, even more than her male co-leads, as an adorable figure, irrepressible but with some deeper subtext to her (watch her as she quietly contemplates her lot before her silly botched suicide letter\/attempt in the garage). Bogart, despite criticism of being too old for the part, plays his notes of comedy, sincerity and uncertainly just right (I loved the scene on the sailboat where she asks about his past loves, and his response being classic Bogie). And despite his original misgivings with Wilder's sense of comedy, he rises to the occasion just as well as the naturally charming William Holden, who is given one of the longest but funniest ass-jokes in movie history.Sabrina isn't the stuff of super-academic or intellectual movie-going. It's a perfect example, however, of how to do a fluffy-but-serious romantic comedy right. Writers (err hacks) who are assigned the drek that is meant to pass as the rom-com genre today should take a look back at Sabrina to see what makes characters likable or just meaningful, what makes a story work in such a context, and what the right casting can do even when the material is 'light' in nature.

This is not John Boorman's fault any more than it was Robert Bresson's when he made Lancelot of the Lake (both of which take the Arthurian legend and tell it with a straight face and upstanding production value). I chuckle at seeing Camelot (and it IS a model indeed), and when Arthur has to face off against Lancelot. But Boorman is so good a director as to still take me out of satire and into the real bloody guts and thrills and drama (or really fantastical melodrama) of this story.Excalibur does start a little shaky on some silly ground, or just a little like huh, really? This comes early when Merlin sets to task the impressionable and fiery Uther Pendragon to have his 'love' with the maiden, and has him cross the 'dragon's breath' (which is just fog) on his horse to ride over to her and so Merlin can do 'his thing' to which he'll have to recover in nine moons. Immediately I started to think yes, this is well-directed, but I can't shake off the connection that the same man made the inexplicable Zardoz. And here and there Boorman goes into such strange and macabre territory that is a little bonkers; sometimes this works well, such as when Morgana puts into effect her plan to have her son with her brother, King Arthur, and it's done in such a way that is chilling and dark and evil, and just right.But once Boorman gets into the Arthur legend, of pulling the sword from the stone and becoming knighted by another who looked under him, and then met Lancelot and Guinnevere and had his ups and downs with Merlin and so on, it becomes more and more satisfying. The actors are well-suited for such material Nigel Terry as Arthur and Nicholas Clay as Lancelot have very direct, two-dimensional characters and they play them as if they were the superheroes of their time, conflicted, troubled, and just a little uneasy in the Dark Ages, but willing to do what it takes when the time comes. And other actors, like Helen Mirren, just eat up the scenery in a delicious kind of way (she doesn't quite start like that, but in the last act as she's the villainess she really is something).Best of all though is Merlin. Whenever Nicol Williamson comes on the screen the film comes alive in a manner that is hard to describe. He just knows how to add the right inflections in the speech, get the right walk and the distinctive stare at Arthur or Morgana, and while his character starts off questionably (taking Arthur from his mother so soon after birth, you say), he makes his character believable and awesome every step of the way. Hell, he even looks the bad-ass when surrounded in a block of ice! All of this benefits Boorman as he takes his story to some epic heights. Very little of it, in fact, is dated because when visual effects or models are implemented they aren't the kind that stick out. Today an Excalibur would be filled with CGI, perhaps even for the metallic clang of the swords. Here, everything is costumes and real forests, castles and armor, body parts flying and blood spilling generously in those battle scenes (or just in any given scene there's some violence).Like Bresson with his 1974 film, Boorman is an iconoclast with his images. He wants things to stick in the viewer's mind long after they end (for me one of those in this case is the scene where Perceval is hanging from the tree and is near death but dreams of something crazy as he's being accidentally cut down). But where Bresson meant for his Arthur to be seen in a more subdued manner with his typical withdrawn non-professional actors, Excalbur is meant as popular entertainment for the masses. This is something that could conceivably be a family film, albeit the generous bloodletting and the occasional gratuitous female nudity. Excalibur takes its source seriously enough to make it work, and without it slipping at least too far into its own parody. Some lines, to be sure, may be delivered very over-the-top, and a particular moment with Morgana near the end is kind of laughable in a sick way.

Ritchie decided on bringing the audience another comedy-gangster caper and he had the added clout of attaching big name stars like Brad Pitt and Benicio del Toro.Snatch tells multiple but interlinking stories set in the London underworld. A 87 carat diamond had been stolen by Frankie Four-Fingers (del Toro) in Antwerp, Belgium. He is sent to London to have it evaluated by the diamond dealer Doug The Head Denovitz (Mike Reid), for an American gangster Avi (Dennis Farina). Frankie is a meant to stay low but his gambling habits play havoc on that idea. Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephen Graham) are organisers and promoters for underground boxing fights A ruthless gangster Brick Top (Alan Ford) recruits them and demands that their fighter throws the fight so he could make a killing for his gambling empire. When Turkish's fighter is unable to fight he is forced to recruit an Irish traveller Mickey (Pitt) to be his boxer but Mickey does not play ball. Boris The Blade (Rade &#x8A;erbed&#x9E;ija) also wants the diamond and he hires two hapless criminals, Sol (Lennie James) and Vinnie (Robbie Gee) to steal it from Frankie. But to do this they end up stepping on Brick Top's turf, who quickly becomes involve in the fight for the diamond.Ritchie as a writer has a limited range as a writer, he often does these mockney gangsters with interlinking story lines, macguffins and over-the-top characters. He is often a man who thinks he is smarter then really is. But even with this formula Ritchie does make a fun film with a lot of comedy and the story elements fit well together. It shows a number of story lines can work if the writing is good. This is of course not a serious take on London gangsters which is a shame really because British filmmaker have made some real classics like Get Carter and The Long Good Friday. But as a comedy take it is still pretty good and there is plenty of action throughout. But there were some really silly things throughout like the names of some of the characters, the use of mockney English because no one speaks like that and the way some characters act throughout the film. Ritchie is stylist in his direction with some brilliant shots throughout and there is a visual kinetic style. The film is fast paced and Ritchie knows how to deliver a action, with the boxing fights and the gun fights. There are some moments of real flair like in the beginning when it uses CCTV screens to follow a group of robbers.There is a excellent cast in this film. Of course the Hollywood A-Listers are good in Snatch, del Toro effectively playing a European gangster and it had to take an American actor to give an over-the-top Irish accent with the ultimate amount of slang. The Stath shows that from his origins as a model and a driver that he can be good actor and shows that he has some real comic energy in Snatch.

A 87 carat diamond had been stolen by Frankie Four-Fingers (del Toro) in Antwerp, Belgium. He is sent to London to have it evaluated by the diamond dealer Doug The Head Denovitz (Mike Reid), for an American gangster Avi (Dennis Farina). Frankie is a meant to stay low but his gambling habits play havoc on that idea.

When Turkish's fighter is unable to fight he is forced to recruit an Irish traveller Mickey (Pitt) to be his boxer but Mickey does not play ball. Boris The Blade (Rade &#x8A;erbed&#x9E;ija) also wants the diamond and he hires two hapless criminals, Sol (Lennie James) and Vinnie (Robbie Gee) to steal it from Frankie. But to do this they end up stepping on Brick Top's turf, who quickly becomes involve in the fight for the diamond.Ritchie as a writer has a limited range as a writer, he often does these mockney gangsters with interlinking story lines, macguffins and over-the-top characters. He is often a man who thinks he is smarter then really is. But even with this formula Ritchie does make a fun film with a lot of comedy and the story elements fit well together. It shows a number of story lines can work if the writing is good. This is of course not a serious take on London gangsters which is a shame really because British filmmaker have made some real classics like Get Carter and The Long Good Friday. But as a comedy take it is still pretty good and there is plenty of action throughout. But there were some really silly things throughout like the names of some of the characters, the use of mockney English because no one speaks like that and the way some characters act throughout the film. Ritchie is stylist in his direction with some brilliant shots throughout and there is a visual kinetic style. The film is fast paced and Ritchie knows how to deliver a action, with the boxing fights and the gun fights. There are some moments of real flair like in the beginning when it uses CCTV screens to follow a group of robbers.There is a excellent cast in this film. Of course the Hollywood A-Listers are good in Snatch, del Toro effectively playing a European gangster and it had to take an American actor to give an over-the-top Irish accent with the ultimate amount of slang. The Stath shows that from his origins as a model and a driver that he can be good actor and shows that he has some real comic energy in Snatch.

In fact for a man who viewed politics as a bloodsport in his life Nixon gets a surprisingly sympathetic treatment from Oliver Stone not someone I thought would give him one.The Nixon we see is the poor kid who scrapped for everything he gained in his lifetime and saw himself constantly in a battle against the elites who had it handed to them. In his own party Nelson Rockefeller symbolized that and in the Democrats Nixon came up against the Kennedy family. Anthony Hopkins really got a good grasp of the character, I'd be curious to hear what kind of research Hopkins did to prepare for the part.Though Nixon the film got four Academy Award nominations, one of them wasn't for editing which I think is the best overall feature of the film. Oliver Stone did a great job in mixing both color and black and white newsreel footage in with the body of the film. So a lot of the historical figures of Nixon's time make cameo appearances in the film.Nixon constantly needed reassuring and he got it wherever he could, be it from wife Pat played here by Joan Allen or from a carefully chosen group of sycophants who made up the White House staff of his Presidency. Some of their names have come down to us in history through the Watergate break-in scandal that brought Nixon down. James Woods is great as Bob Haldeman the White House chief of staff, an opportunist of the first order who when Nixon needed someone to tell him to back off was there to throw gasoline on the fire. Even his very looks when Woods has no dialog show this self satisfied smugness of a man whose reached the top by attaching himself to a person of power.Another portrayal that is worthy of mention is that of Mary Steenburgen who was described both by her husband and her most famous son as a saint. She's seen in flashback with her children imparting certain moral lessons, but in the case of son Richard giving him an inflexible self righteousness that justifies some really low political actions all in the promoting of the career of Nixon.Nixon got four Oscar nominations for Anthony Hopkins as Best Actor, for Joan Allen as Best Supporting Actress, for Best Original Screenplay and for Best Musical Score. Sad it did not take home a winner in any of these categories.Nixon will stand the test of time as a fine piece cinema drama about a complex man and the times he lived in.

It's a film recognized today for its drama and numerous accounts of humor. The movie takes place around the San Francisco Bay area. Harold played by Bud Cort and Maude played by Ruth Gordon, are the two main characters, they become very close friends; during the journey towards their friendship; we realize the reasons on why they do. The main reason is that Maude teaches Harold her motto in life, which is here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to things We are shown this over a great amount of activities that take place and the songs that represent friendship, that are played every time Harold and Maude are together. In the movie Harold; is a 19 year old boy that seems to not really like his life, he is first introduced to us, as he walks down the stairs of his house, by looking you can tell he seems to come from a very wealthy family. As he walks he goes over to an LP record and starts playing Cat Stevens Don't Be Shy, he then goes over to a chair where he sits down and writes some sort of a note and pins it to his suit jacket. We then see him placing a stool or a chair in the middle of the floor, lighting a candle, and then stands on the stool; he hesitates to step off but then does, all you see after that is his feet dangling; indicating that he just hung himself. However Harold had done that and other ridiculous and fake suicides to try and get the attention of his mother. Because he has an obsession with death, and has done several of his own pretend suicides, he attends funerals for fun, and eventually buys a hearse as his first vehicle. Seventy-nine year old Maude is a crazy driver who takes random cars for the heck of it, loves listening to music and believes living each day by day as if it is your last. We first meet her for the first time when Harold went to a funeral. She was sitting in the back by a tree trunk, eating an apple, she sneezes and Harold looks over at her. Maude seems to be very out going and doesn't care what people think, she does what ever she wants and doesn't let anyone or anything get in her way. She shares her interest in attending funerals for fun. At the second funeral she introduces herself to Harold. At one point that Maude and Harold are together, we can see a tattoo on her arm of numbers, showing that she was in a concentration camp when she was younger. The two soon form an incredible bond, during that time Maude slowly shows Harold her love in music, she teaches him how to sing and dance, how to play the banjo and how to admire art. After a week of spending time together Harold realizes her belief in living every day as if it was your last. Which is why they take a tree out of the city because she thought it was dieing and needed to be moved into the forest so it could live longer. Since Maude had a huge impact on his life he eventually stopped pretending to commit suicide, and didn't feel like he needed to strive for his mothers' attention anymore. However his mother attempted to find a wife for him to settle down with, because she was tired of him faking his own death(s), and thought that sending him to a therapist and setting him up would change how he acted; not knowing that he had been with a 79 year old women for the past week, who he had fallen in love with. Because he would much rather spend time with Maude he wasn't interested in spending any sort of time with any of the girls his mother tried to get him to be with; to send them off he would act crazy or in better words sketchy. For one of his dates he sets a sheet on fire, even though he wasn't in them, she ran out of the room screaming, for another one he uses a fake knife to kill himself, because he would much rather be spending time with Maude. Harold announces that he will marry Maude. As her 80th birthday arrives, he throws her a surprise party. As they dance, she says that she couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell. Confused Harold asked what she meant by that, she then tells him that she has purposely taken an overdosed on pills and will be dead by midnight. After her time in the hospital he felt he shouldn't let it get him down, because Maude had changed his life and he learned to not be so depressed, and to live life on the edge. At the end of the film Harold drives his car off a cliff however he wasn't in it he was at the top of the cliff where he started playing If you want to sing out; on the banjo Maude taught him to play. I really enjoyed this movie because of Maude life lesson. In a short amount of time she changed a boy's life, who always attended funerals, pretended to commit suicide to get his mothers attention and always had a pale look on his face, like he really didn't want to be alive. However after spending time with Maude he stopped all of that, and is now not depressed because Maude would say something like, it's not worth it to be sad.

This film is about a strange old lady who helps a young man to be happy and be himself, and they fall in love at the same time.   This movie was directed by Hal Ashby, and Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon play the main characters. The acting in this film is very good; Ruth Gordon is perfectly crazy and fun, Bud Cort is strange and gives off the feeling of needing love and attention, and Vivian Pickles as Harold's mother seems very high class and like an odd mother to live with. Film elements and production quality are also very good in this film. Every shot and scene seems planned out very well, and the cameramen got to be creative since there are scenes clearly shot from helicopter like the scene where Harold and Maude are escaping from the cop on the motorcycle. The soundtrack for this film is also very good. Cat Stevens does all the music for the film so each song is perfect for the story and the situation. The main song of the film If You Want To Sing Out, Sing Out, was made for the film by Cat Stevens and it reflects the main theme of the film very well; That theme is to live life to the fullest and freely.   The plot of this film is another good point because it is engaging and exciting, but it also perfectly shows how Harold changes to become a happier person. At the beginning of the film it is clear that Harold has issues, he keeps committing fake suicides and he never seems to be happy or enjoying himself. Then he meets Maude at a funeral and after a while they are out doing strange things together slowly changing Harold into a more freely acting person. The change in Harold is so subtle and perfectly done you don't even notice exactly how he changes through the film. For example, through the film Harold gets more tan and starts dressing more colorfully.In conclusion, this is a feel-good, happy, and funny film that can really teach you things about living a happy life, and that is what makes this film so good. One warning though, nobody should watch this film if suicide is a touchy subject because you see Harold commit many realistic looking fake suicides throughout the movie, and because, SPOILER ALERT, Maude actually does commit suicide at the end and it is a sad part in the movie.

Every shot and scene seems planned out very well, and the cameramen got to be creative since there are scenes clearly shot from helicopter like the scene where Harold and Maude are escaping from the cop on the motorcycle. The soundtrack for this film is also very good. Cat Stevens does all the music for the film so each song is perfect for the story and the situation. The main song of the film If You Want To Sing Out, Sing Out, was made for the film by Cat Stevens and it reflects the main theme of the film very well; That theme is to live life to the fullest and freely.   The plot of this film is another good point because it is engaging and exciting, but it also perfectly shows how Harold changes to become a happier person. At the beginning of the film it is clear that Harold has issues, he keeps committing fake suicides and he never seems to be happy or enjoying himself. Then he meets Maude at a funeral and after a while they are out doing strange things together slowly changing Harold into a more freely acting person. The change in Harold is so subtle and perfectly done you don't even notice exactly how he changes through the film. For example, through the film Harold gets more tan and starts dressing more colorfully.In conclusion, this is a feel-good, happy, and funny film that can really teach you things about living a happy life, and that is what makes this film so good. One warning though, nobody should watch this film if suicide is a touchy subject because you see Harold commit many realistic looking fake suicides throughout the movie, and because, SPOILER ALERT, Maude actually does commit suicide at the end and it is a sad part in the movie.

THEY'LL NEVER MAKE IT!So goes the explosive text on the poster for Columbia Picture's 3.TEN TO YUMA (1957). An iconic western 3.TEN TO YUMA has quite deservedly taken its place in the pantheon of classic fifties westerns alongside Shane, The Searchers, High Noon et al. From a story by the tireless Elmore Leonard it was beautifully written for the screen by Halsted Welles and produced for the studio by David Heilwell. With stark monochrome cinematography by the great Charles Lawton Jr. the picture was arguably the best directorial effort to come from master craftsman Delmer Daves.Glenn Ford heads a superb cast as notorious outlaw Ben Wade who, with his gang, holds up the Butterfield stagecoach, kills the guard and relieves it of its strongbox contents. Van Heflin is Dan Evens the struggling small rancher who - with his wife (Leora Dana) and two small sons try their best to eke out a living on their dried out small holding. But without rain or the money to buy water rights for a nearby stream to water the cattle Dan finds it difficult to carry on. But then luck comes his way. Wade is captured by the posse and the Sheriff offers $200 to anyone who will take Wade to Contention City and transport him by train on the 3. ten to Yuma prison. Dan immediately accepts the job and so begins a tension filled few hours as Dan holds his captive in a Contention hotel room to wait for the train. And all the while staving off the efforts of Wade's men to free their boss as well as contend with Wade trying to psych him out with tempting bribes to let him go. Excitement reaches fever pitch when its time to leave the hotel and go for the train. But then just as Wade's men are closing in for the kill, and in a surprise move, Wade capitulates and actually helps Dan to get him aboard the moving train.Performances are excellent! Ford has rarely been better! As Ben Wade he is roguish, cool and throughly likable. Heflin is great too! His Dan Evens looking almost like an extension of his Joe Starrett from Shane four years earlier. And Looking gorgeous is the beautiful Felicia Farr in a splendid cameo as the girl in the saloon. There is a lovely moment at the bar in the empty saloon when Wade is trying to seduce her (Ye know ye look kinda skinny - but I don't mind a skinny girl if she's got blue eyes). Poignantly scored and beautifully directed - the scene in close-up, as he kisses her, is both amorous and heartfelt and played out by two superb actors.Providing a wonderful atmosphere to the movie is the music of composer George Duning. Duning was composer in residence at Columbia Pictures and scored most of their prestigious productions like Bell,Book & Candle, The Devil At Four O'Clock and his best known work Picnic (1956) in which he pulled a master stroke by combining the tune Moonglow with his own love theme to great effect for the evocative scene where William Holden dances with Kim Novak. His music for 3.TEN TO YUMA boasts a lingering central theme. It is given lovely renditions throughout especially for solo guitar and distant solo female voice. Then with added lyrics by Ned Washington it was turned into a brilliant ballad and sung over the titles by the inimitable Frankie Laine.Fifty years after 3.TEN TO YUMA an unfortunate revisionist remake was produced. It improved on the original NOT one iota and only served to emphasize how good the Delmer Daves classic really is!

","genre":"Drama, Thriller, Western"},{"date":"19 May 2010","score":"","review":" Harold and Maude is an unlikely love story that takes readers on an unexpected adventure as the lives of two unique yet perfectly matched people intertwine. In this story the underdog, Harold, comes out a changed and better man in the end of the movie. This story line appeals to many viewers whether or not they can directly relate to his situation.The movie was filmed in the San Francisco Bay area and released in America in 1971. The film was directed by Hal Ashby and written Colin Higgins, with featured music by Cat Stevens throughout. Although the film was a box office disappointment, it has since reached new heights, being praised by film critics and avid-viewers alike as a funny, believable, charming movie.Harold's character, played by Bud Cort, is a young man coming from a rich family who goes against his mother's every will in a desperate attempt to gain her attention and affection. He continually stages his own deaths and suicides, some more ridiculous than others, until she reaches her wits end and orders him to marry in an attempt to fix his attitude for good. Unlike most young men his age, Harold enjoys visiting funerals, graveyards, and demolition sites. Although he doesn't find a bride his mother would approve of at any of his hangouts, he does find a new and wonderful friend.Maude's character is the pivotal person in Harold's life. Like him, she enjoys the morbid, but for different reasons. Through her eccentricities and unconditional love for living things, she shows Harold that life can be good if it's truly enjoyed and appreciated to the fullest each day. A lot of people enjoy being dead, but they're not dead. They're just backing away from life. Maude is considerably older than Harold, and seems to take him under her wing through the movie, helping him find things in life that make him happy besides being dead.The culmination of this happy-go-lucky movie is Harold and Maude falling in love, or Harold falling in love with her. He shows her the things that he has learned in a birthday party he throws for her 80th birthday. All is going well until Harold discovers she has poisoned herself in order to die because she doesn't believe she wants to live beyond 80. Harold is distraught and takes her to the hospital, but not before it's too late. The audience can sympathize with his sadness and grief at the loss of what we believe is his only true friend in life, and his lover.The life lessons Maude taught Harold are obvious at the end of the movie, when the shot angles and scenes lead us to believe he will drive himself off a cliff in one last suicide, but walks away from the cliff with a banjo in his arms, plucking out If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out by Cat Stevens. He is going to go on and live life to the fullest, so he can truly live before he dies.The film is full of interesting shots and scenes. There are some strange angles and locations that keep the viewer intrigued and following the story. A great scene that allows the viewer to think that they are really watching the couple as they evolve as people is the scene where they are dancing in Maude's house. The camera pans out through the window and tracks them at their eye level as they dance down her streetcar home to a Cat Stevens song. This is just one example of the brilliant filming abilities and directing used in the film.The film also uses the music of Cat Stevens to illustrate scenes in a new light. The scene where Harold and Maude are in the military graveyard is one example of this. As the camera view pans out and up to show more and more of the massive graveyard, the song Where do the Children Play cries out above the dark scene. This seems to be a reference not only to wars in general but possibly the Vietnam War specifically. The scene is just one political statement made in the movie, but one that stood out strongly to me.The movie starts out very strange, and very slow. The viewer isn't given much information to go on or use to enjoy the film fully until Maude appears and shakes up the structure of Harold's life. The ending of the movie is the culmination of a warm and exciting journey that the audience has followed Harold make and felt as though they were apart of, and the way he handles Maude's death is a closing scene that is sure to stick on minds and hearts of all kinds of viewers.
