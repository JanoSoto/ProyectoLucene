Best of all Christmas movies have this way of being literally timeless...standing the test of all time. Miracle on 34th Street is exactly that!! It is a lovely, fantastic, fantasy family drama about Santa Clause. Heart warming lovely, entertaining and brilliantly made! Made in 1947, over five decades ago, and it doesn't show age for even a second! This film could be watched anywhere and anytime and you'll take away from it the feeling of pure happiness when its all done. Quite plainly it is one of the sweetest movies ever made and just plain fun on top of that!! The legendary Maureen O'Hara plays no-nonsense business woman Doris Walker. One of the things I love about this film is that such a strong female lead is allowed to be strong even in 1947. Never once is she played down to and she does a terrific job. She's hard nosed but has a softer side that gradually comes out. John Payne is the fun loving and often child like (but in a good way) lawyer Fred Gailey. Both O'Hara and Gailey aren't really front and centre characters but yet they're very important to the overall picture. This film focuses on two characters. One is of course Kris Kringle, played absolutely brilliantly by Edmund Gwenn, who I think could make anyone believe he is Santa Clause. He will go down in my books as giving one of the sweetest most believable performances in cinema history for me. He is absolutely perfect. In one scene when he speaks dutch to a little girl...it brings tears to my eyes every time because he just exudes everything about the legendary character of Kris Kringle. Hollywood legend Natalie Wood is also perfect as equally hard nosed, realist Susan. Raised by her mother, who is clearly very loving, but also teaches her to be realistic and not let her imagination get away with her. This lovely little girl begins to open her heart to the idea of Santa Clause and by the end is a true believer.The film delivers another thing that goes down in my books as being legendary and that is the courtroom scene where the thousands of letters from children are delivered to prove Kris Kringle is real. It inevitably will make you smile like the whole film. Director and writer George Seaton clearly knows exactly how to tell a story and make everything just roll out at the perfect pace. The setting of the department stores, to the apartments of the various characters to the courtroom just fits together and works so well. Even if its not Christmas this is the perfect family film that everyone will find something to enjoy. Just simply a beautiful film, entertaining, fun and truly deserves to be called a classic. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 January 2012","score":"","review":" Christmas Movies seem simple enough because when you find your favourite you can watch it again and again every year and just adore it like it was the first time.

Now you're bombarded with the all out R rated horrifying dirty comedies of nowadays. Not all of them are bad if you like that gross out comedy style. But back in the 80's, even the late 80's, adult comedy was a whole different ball game and the National Lampoon Vacation Movies pioneered many of those laughs. Christmas Vacation is definitely unique because I don't believe there were a lot of adult oriented Christmas movies out there. And no matter what anyone else says this an adult comedy. It has bad language, sexual connotations, and just general a lot of adult humour. But it works so well and this film is downright hilarious. The script is just incredibly clever and the film makers let Chevy Chase do exactly what he does best and delivers the dialogue like a comedy legend. The cast works so well together and its such an ensemble cast of wacky and zany characters and you can't help but fall in love with the entire Griswold family. Its a laugh out loud, slapstick, comedy classic.This was Chevy Chase at his best. Even now years later if you see him on Community he still delivers that awkward, gangly everyman type character that delivers outstanding one liners and hilarious dialogue. Clark Griswold is perfect and no one could do that role like Chase. You just love this guy no matter what through all his mistakes and stupid follies. I always thought that Beverly D'Angelo had a strange chemistry with Chevy Chase, they seem like polar opposites but yet their chemistry has always worked for the Vacation movies and still works perfectly in this one. She's definitely the straight man to the entire film and doesn't get a lot of the gags but she is Chevy Chase's perfect partner. Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki are the Griswold children this time around and they are good and they fulfil their duties appropriately but neither one really stand out. One of the legendary performances in this film is that by Randy Quaid as the infamous Cousin Eddie. Quaid is downright brilliant as the white trash trailer park Cousin with a big heart but no brains. Him and Chase are brilliant together and you can't help but howl at his misfortunes and stupid blunders. The supporting cast are one of the best ensembles in movie history, all bringing about some of the best laughs ever. William Hickey, Mae Questel, Doris Roberts, John Randolph, and Miriam Flynn are a few of the truly stand out performances in supporting roles. Also deserving of mentioning is Brian Doyle-Murray in a small role as Chase's money hungry boss. Two performances that are wasted and pointless are that of Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Nicholas Guest as the annoyed neighbours. There is no purpose to them in the film and they are just more annoying than anything.The film makers, led by Canadian director Jeremiah Chechik, packed so much into this movie and yet it doesn't feel crowded. It feels like the perfect Holiday slapstick comedy. You feel like you become one of the Griswold's and partake in every moment of their insane holiday. Ridiculous physical comedy, hilarious chemistry between the cast makes this an absolute must see every Holiday season or even any time. This was director Chechik's debut and its easy to see why he's worked steadily in Hollywood since then, even in Television because he clearly has an eye for making a film feel right, pacing it right, and letting the actors do what they do best.

I had forgotten what a thrilling, exciting, and often uproariously funny gem of a thriller this movie was, and it still holds up beautifully almost four decades later.I read in the trivia that the producers said that PELHAM was a smash hit in cities with subways but flopped pretty much everywhere else, which I find hard to understand, because you do not need to be familiar with any subway system to enjoy this movie's taut script, edgy direction, brilliant performances, perfect atmospheric score, and the astonishing way it walks the tightrope between nail-biting suspense and laugh-out-loud comedy (The Mayor of New York is a particular joy; looks a bit like Ed Koch and whines about being booed in public, and sure enough, when he makes his obligatory public appearance, the crowd boos. That moment alone is worth the price of the ticket.) Interestingly enough, this film came out four years BEFORE Koch became Mayor; a happy accident, if you will, but one that makes the movie that much more fun. Back to the main plot. I think by now, thanks to the 2009 remake (though God knows why they bothered; you cannot improve on what is already nearly perfect), most people know at least the bare bones of the plot Four men in disguises hijack a Lexington Avenue line subway train, detaching one car from the rest of the train and demanding a million dollars in one hour or they will begin shooting hostages (a wonderful collection of characters as New York as they can get). The task of dealing with this crisis falls to Transit Authority policeman Lieutenant Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau, brilliant as always), who must rouse the Mayor out of his sickbed (he has the flu), butt heads with MTA official Corell (Dick O'Neill in a splendid performance), and do his usual bellowing and strutting, all with perfectly executed timing, in an effort to get the crisis resolved without the shedding of innocent blood.The villains are a fascinating lot. Led by Robert Shaw in a chilling performance as Mr Blue (they use colors as code names), the crew consists of Mr Grey (Hector Elizondo), a trigger-happy former mobster (is there such a thing?), Mr Brown (Earl Hindman), the group's general gofer, and Mr Green (Martin Balsam in another of the splendid character roles he was so justly famous for), a former subway motorman fired by the MTA and presumably trying to get even, and suffering from a rather noticeable head cold (keep your eye on that).This is one of those great movies that is bigger and better than the sum of its parts. Its parts are nothing to sneeze at (you should excuse the pun), but put together, they create nothing short of cinematic magic; this is easily one of the best suspense thrillers since Hitchcock's heyday, and I think the Master of Suspense would have been proud to claim it as his own.Predictably enough, things do not go as smoothly as Garber would wish; getting a million dollars together in less than an hour is no small feat (demonstrated in a brilliant montage of scenes of hands and machines counting, sorting, and bundling hundred-dollar bills), and Garber's pleas for more time fall on deaf ears. Blue is a cold, calculating killer and completely impossible to turn from his purpose.I won't give away too much more, but at the crisis point the subway car is rigged so that it will go from Times Square to South Ferry (roughly fifty City blocks or so) with nothing but green signals so that it will not only not stop, but will pick up speed and eventually we are faced with a runaway subway car, screaming hostages, police rendered impotent, and a chiller of a denouement that ends at the final moment with an unexpected laugh (I won't tell you what it is; it would be too much of a spoiler).I am a native New Yorker and lived there for more than forty years and rode the subways regularly, so this movie was and is a particular treat for New Yorkers. But you don't have to be from New York, or even familiar with the inner workings of a city subway system, to be captivated by Joseph Sargent's brilliant and exciting creation, with a sensational script by Peter Stone, and Owen Roizman's marvelous camera-work, a particularly notable accomplishment since, this story being set in the subway, much of the action has perforce to take place in the dark or semi-dark.Great ride.

Interestingly enough, this film came out four years BEFORE Koch became Mayor; a happy accident, if you will, but one that makes the movie that much more fun. Back to the main plot. I think by now, thanks to the 2009 remake (though God knows why they bothered; you cannot improve on what is already nearly perfect), most people know at least the bare bones of the plot Four men in disguises hijack a Lexington Avenue line subway train, detaching one car from the rest of the train and demanding a million dollars in one hour or they will begin shooting hostages (a wonderful collection of characters as New York as they can get). The task of dealing with this crisis falls to Transit Authority policeman Lieutenant Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau, brilliant as always), who must rouse the Mayor out of his sickbed (he has the flu), butt heads with MTA official Corell (Dick O'Neill in a splendid performance), and do his usual bellowing and strutting, all with perfectly executed timing, in an effort to get the crisis resolved without the shedding of innocent blood.The villains are a fascinating lot. Led by Robert Shaw in a chilling performance as Mr Blue (they use colors as code names), the crew consists of Mr Grey (Hector Elizondo), a trigger-happy former mobster (is there such a thing?), Mr Brown (Earl Hindman), the group's general gofer, and Mr Green (Martin Balsam in another of the splendid character roles he was so justly famous for), a former subway motorman fired by the MTA and presumably trying to get even, and suffering from a rather noticeable head cold (keep your eye on that).This is one of those great movies that is bigger and better than the sum of its parts. Its parts are nothing to sneeze at (you should excuse the pun), but put together, they create nothing short of cinematic magic; this is easily one of the best suspense thrillers since Hitchcock's heyday, and I think the Master of Suspense would have been proud to claim it as his own.Predictably enough, things do not go as smoothly as Garber would wish; getting a million dollars together in less than an hour is no small feat (demonstrated in a brilliant montage of scenes of hands and machines counting, sorting, and bundling hundred-dollar bills), and Garber's pleas for more time fall on deaf ears. Blue is a cold, calculating killer and completely impossible to turn from his purpose.I won't give away too much more, but at the crisis point the subway car is rigged so that it will go from Times Square to South Ferry (roughly fifty City blocks or so) with nothing but green signals so that it will not only not stop, but will pick up speed and eventually we are faced with a runaway subway car, screaming hostages, police rendered impotent, and a chiller of a denouement that ends at the final moment with an unexpected laugh (I won't tell you what it is; it would be too much of a spoiler).I am a native New Yorker and lived there for more than forty years and rode the subways regularly, so this movie was and is a particular treat for New Yorkers. But you don't have to be from New York, or even familiar with the inner workings of a city subway system, to be captivated by Joseph Sargent's brilliant and exciting creation, with a sensational script by Peter Stone, and Owen Roizman's marvelous camera-work, a particularly notable accomplishment since, this story being set in the subway, much of the action has perforce to take place in the dark or semi-dark.Great ride. Great film. And you don't have to be from New York to love it.

This is what can be said about this film except that it presents its stories without having this sort of spiritual value. It brings this idea of the eternal returning throughout this main character but it is developed almost like a fairy tale taken out of a children's book.Travelling through different countries and periods of time, going from the Celts cavemen to the modern New York businessman, Being Human has Robin Williams playing a character named Hector and his appearances in distinct centuries trying to learn what means to be an human being. In the five short stories created here, Hector, living as an Celtic in the highlands, had his wife and children taken away by barbarians; was the slave of a dumb master (John Turturro) in a more civilized era; an married man who fell in love with an foreign woman, a few centuries later; a military during the Portugual's Maritime Expansion on Africa, conquering new lands and new treasures; and as troubled divorced man trying to reconciliate with his children of whom he hasn't seen since the end of his marriage. The movie fails in being real or accurate enough in all of the stories except in the last one which is very close to us.Slow, of mannered delivery and hardly getting better as the stories unfold, Being Human is the kind of film that really follows its lessons, it'll only grow on you after countless views. In my case four attempts, of these in two I fell asleep (but always believing that there was something interesting there), one in which I watched the whole thing and didn't like and the last one in which my perception changed and end up being a good film, far from being a masterpiece that it could be. So, you'll have to watch this film over and over until you get something from it, then you can evolve into really saying if this is a good or a bad film. This whole idea of a man trapped in strange and quite horrendous situations where every kind of decision ruin his life but always running to something else thinking it'll be better and lead him to a good life, was brilliantly presented in a book called The Star Rover by Jack London. In it, the main character is a prisoner that can recall his past lives as a way of escaping from his current pain of being tortured. But in those lives things don't get any better and he's always getting into more and more trouble. Being Human falls as an pretentious art film with symbolisms that never work and stories that are difficult to be involved with. Luckily, they have Williams as a main actor and we root for him whatever the Hector he's playing. We care for Hector in all of his situations because there's something there that is involving enough to make us imagining what kind of decisions we would make if we were him. In at least, one of the stories you'll put yourself into Hector's shoes. Won't blame director\/writer Bill Forsyth for the flaws presented here since this is not his original project, Warner Bros. forced him to cut the film and include an narration that is quite excessive and too much explanatory. The narration (provided by Theresa Russell) of a film destined to grown up's treats its audience as children, explaining many things we're seeing on the screen. It ruined some parts of the film. Result poor criticism, an box-office failure and now who knows this film? I sincerely hope that one day Forsyth come out of the shadows and show to the world this film in its integrity in a director's cut DVD (even the known version is hard to find). The things that attracted me into Being Human are the quality of the performances, not only Williams but also Turturro, Lorraine Bracco, Hector Elizondo, Jonathan Hyde, Anna Galiena, William H. Macy among others; the beautiful cinematography; Michael Gibbs fantastic musical score (specially the music presented when the movie enters into the 20th Century, an highly agitated theme). The story, at times, knows how to hold our interest but only for those who have an open mind to accept the concept of a man living over and over a similar life that bears only difference of costumes and periods of time. Hector's conditions and the way love acts in his life are quite the same, yet he fails to learn something from these experiences.

The US Government hires him, one day, to go in search of the Ark of the Covenant.

Corey HAIM was fantastic in this movie, really played the part the best it could be played! Joel Schumacher was an awesome director and should have done the sequels too and as I said before a LOT earlier. 20 years after the original doing a sequel was only going to work if they had the original cast and Joel!!! This movie will always be my favourite and obviously I give this a 10\/10. I don't know ANYONE who doesn't like this movie! Vampire movies are the best there have been loads but none of them are a patch on this!

First off, casting Gregory Peck was a huge misfire. Seeing him try to pull off being an English barrister is kinda painful. It just doesn't work. This was a role before Peck became a superstar so maybe he was just getting his bearings as an actor.It doesn't help that the major issue with this film is o'Selznicks script. He is most certainly not a screenwriter. Some of the dialog and scene changes are so bad it's sad.Towards the end there's a scene where the old judge is sitting with his wife and she tries to talk him out of sentencing the defendant to death and she says something like..don't find her guilty or sentence her to death, she's had a hard enough life. Are you kidding me? How stupid is that. Girl kills her husband, who did nothing to her, and we should just let it pass? Gimme a break. This is that o'Selznick script writing again. The whole premise of the film is centered around how a high end barrister takes the case of a supposed husband killer and how everyone around him sees him falling in love with her. Within 20 minutes of the film there's already talk about it but there's one problem, there are no lead-ins letting you know its happened. I mean he meets with her twice in prison to talk about the case and there's no chemistry at all.Figuring out why this film was made is pretty simple. Read around online and you'll see the history behind this and right off you know that o'Selznick totally took over this film and therein lies the problem. He totally takes control of the film and just ruins it with bad casting and even worse screen writing. It's like taking a lawn mower mechanic and telling him to go work on a Ferrari. He had no business writing for this work. You can bet Hitchcock was glad to finish out his contract with this minimal work. Seemed like he just phoned this one in to be done with it. Being that this was his last film with this studio and knowing the Hitchcock time-line, you'll notice how after this film is when his best films were made.

He's expecting to become president of the bank he works at any day now, he has a loving wife, a home, a boat, a daughter in the Ivy League, and yet he feels incomplete. Here is a man who made the choices that society told him to instead of following his own intuition. With seemingly nothing to lose, Arthur makes a Faustian deal with a shady company that affirms him a new and happy life for the meager price of $30,000 (adjusted for inflation, nearly $200,000 today.) However, if a man leads a soulless existence, even the most attractive and wealthy one will feel empty.There's allegory galore here including the yearning for a fountain of youth, existentialism, the cons of materialism, the impersonal nature of modern society, and man's search for meaning. Is ultimate freedom really the secret to happiness? Is having a family, routine, and stability the pillars on which to build your life? These questions are up to the viewer to decide. I can't help but wonder if Rock Hudson himself identified personally with the story, seeing as he was a gay man hiding his lifestyle for many years. He had to have drawn on his own personal fears of living a life for other people, only to mournfully regret this decision later in life.Seconds is a genre film that was far before its time. There was no audience ready in 1966, but this will live on in discussions of cult cinema. Frankenheimer never cheats the viewer or condescends to them, which adds an authenticity that's not standard of this genre. This is an excellent paranoia piece that always carries an undercurrent of dread that's inescapable. The score by Jerry Goldsmith is incredible and adds an even thicker layer of delusion to the manic direction. Dark, cynical, and refusing to let the audience off the hook at the end.

You should be someone accustomed into viewing, strange and bizarre stories. The start maybe what seems to be a typical drama regarding a looser puppeteer living with his wife and some animals. We actually get caught into their lives till one day our protagonist finds a secret portal to Being John Malkovich. Starts out to be a realistic movie but the deeper you get the stranger and surreal it gets. A very well written screenplay in which the information is passed onto us through different characters in different ways. Meaning We know exactly as much as the protagonist, we know more the some characters and we certainly know way less then someone else. This brings me to the editing, which is good for it's purpose. It get's the story running, never makes you feel bored and has a good rhythm as well as some pretty interesting cuts.I would say the directors choice of using two different visual styles, depending on who he focused, makes the story much more understandable as well as funny, some, but far from being really innovative, the screenplay, again makes it so different.Acting wise&#x85; great. Each actor knows exactly the character they have to be and how to make them believable. All in one, I'd give it a 7 out of 10, for being absurdly funny, unrealistically true and above all entertaining, leaving you a quite indescribable aftertaste after watching the movie.

Starts out to be a realistic movie but the deeper you get the stranger and surreal it gets. A very well written screenplay in which the information is passed onto us through different characters in different ways. Meaning We know exactly as much as the protagonist, we know more the some characters and we certainly know way less then someone else. This brings me to the editing, which is good for it's purpose. It get's the story running, never makes you feel bored and has a good rhythm as well as some pretty interesting cuts.I would say the directors choice of using two different visual styles, depending on who he focused, makes the story much more understandable as well as funny, some, but far from being really innovative, the screenplay, again makes it so different.Acting wise&#x85; great. Each actor knows exactly the character they have to be and how to make them believable. All in one, I'd give it a 7 out of 10, for being absurdly funny, unrealistically true and above all entertaining, leaving you a quite indescribable aftertaste after watching the movie.

There's both power and nuance in the performances of the principal players, totally miscast some would say, with Tom Hanks as a gangster\/hit-man, and Paul Newman as an organized crime boss who's been like a father to him. That presumption is totally without merit, as both actors deliver incredible performances in this tale of betrayal and revenge set in the winter of 1931.With each viewing, I'm more and more impressed with the subtleties offered by the actors and director alike. Consider the following scenes - the Sullivan's abandoning their home along with young Michael's innocence as symbolized by the bike left behind to rust in the snow; the bead of sweat meandering down the side of Michael's face in the diner scene opposite his intended assassin (Jude Law); son Michael's negotiating for two hundred dollars as his share of the bank jobs; the hit on Connor (Daniel Craig) as viewed via his reflection in the swinging door of the bathroom in which he died.This is a finely crafted tale that demands close attention. Initially, one would believe that the elder Rooney (Newman) ordered the hit on Michael Sullivan with that visit to Calvino. But it was Connor's doing all the way, then botching the rubout of the remaining family by only taking out the wife and younger son. The senior Rooney's angst is palpable, realizing that his own flesh and blood is inept and unworthy of forgiveness, but unable to reconcile his fatherly instinct to preserve his own. The single fault I find with the characterization of the principals is during the failed attempt on Sullivan in the hotel room. After Maguire (Law) is disabled by the shards of glass, the elder Michael should have put an end to the chase right there.Interestingly, the story makes clever use of placing real life gangsters in the story's plot, naming Mafia kingpin Al Capone as an off screen presence, and using his top henchman Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci) to bridge an untenable truce between the rival parties. The violence in the picture is never overdone, unless one is squeamish about the up close and personal type of vengeance as administered by professional hit men.With any other film, the ending might have been a tear jerker affair, but there were no clean hands here. All of the principal characters were flawed in their own way, including young Michael, portrayed by Tyler Hoechlin in a stellar role. Narrated from the perspective of a twelve year old son's coming of age, Road to Perdition earns it's place as one of the top gangster films of the modern era.

However, his life was plagued by the unfortunate disease known as Schizophrenia. He spoke of characters, such as Charles Herman and William Parcher, characters who did not exist. His life became one nightmare after the other during this time, as these visions would threaten everything in his world, including that of his then-wife.Ron Howard definitely deserved the best director award here, but if anything, it was the acting that got me hooked. Russell Crowe does a very good job as Nash, who, all his life, wanted to look for an idea. Jennifer Connelly is amazing as Alicia Nash, who starts off as a student of Nash's, and ends up becoming the wife who fears for Nash. Connelly definitely deserved her award for this; If any other work of hers parallels Blood Diamond, it is this one. Ed Harris, of course, is always great in every movie he's in, and this one is no different. He plays the Parcher delusion, who is an agent for the Department of Defence, and is trying to get Nash to help them fight the Soviets. Paul Bettany is great as the Charles Herman delusion, who becomes Nash's best friend throughout his university years. Josh Lucas is great, and those who remember watching The Sound of Music when they were younger will be delighted to see Christopher Plummer on the screen here.All in all, A Beautiful Mind is a well-acted movie that is both a touching love story and an educational look at any type of psychiatric disorder. 10\/10 for me.
