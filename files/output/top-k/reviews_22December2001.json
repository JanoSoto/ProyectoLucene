I was fully prepared to take the film as it came, good or bad. In the end, I was in heaven. This film is quite simply stunning. It took me a few minutes to say anything coherent about it other than wow. Lets take this one area at a time.1) Non-human races. Elves are cool. Elves rock my world. Yes, I thought the elves were portrayed wonderfully. They aren't fluffy or cute, aren't tree-huggers, and they most assuredly Are Not Nice. Frankly, two of the most disturbing characters in the film are Elrond and Galadriel. Elrond is hard-edged, stern, and you certainly know that he has power. Galadriel is just freaky, and in some cases almost terrifying, simply because she manages to capture so completely the alien otherness of being an elf of her age and power. In fact, all of the elves are done this way. they have a kind of instinctive superiority complex, which shows itself through every word and action. Their speech, movement, fighting style, demeanour, heck, even they way they stand and the way they look at things, all contribute to them almost screaming we aren't human, not even a little bit. These are elves the way they should be.The dwarves (the few we see) are all equally well realised, gruff, dour, insular (but with deep feeling for their own race), as well as inhumanly stubborn. The hobbits are captured to perfection too. Their nature shines out of their every move, their every word. The little people without a care, who suddenly have this Dark Destiny thrust upon them. It will be interesting to see how they develop in the next two films.The Orks\/Uruks These guys are scary. What is perhaps most interesting of all, however, is the way they look almost similar to elves, as, like the film and book says, they were created by warping and twisting elves to produce the ork race. very clever.The Nazgul. Scary Scary Scary brilliant. These could so easily have been pap, but their menace and the terror they inspire were brilliantly carried across. Although the moment with one staggering around with a flaming torch stuck out of his hood where his face should be is pure slapstick (and actually not detracting).All in all, the non-humans totally suck you into believing that they are what they are. There's none of the add-a-forehead Star-Trek Alien-of-the-Week about this. They arent human. They dont think Like humans, they don't act like humans. Enough said.2) The plot and action This could so easily have been bad. It was good. The story has been tightened up in places, some bits have been spliced, some excised. But as a plot, it all hangs together. Certainly its a whole lot grittier than the books, darker in tone. Even Aragorn has more of the darkness about him, his self-doubt over his own strength to withstand the ring, and a slightly nasty edge that really works. The ring itself is brilliantly done. The visuals involved with wearing it really do conjour up the idea that the ring pulls the wearer into the world of wraiths, not a nice place to be. The way it also insidiously goes to work on every party member, rather than just Frodo and Boromir, is a stroke of pure genius, and just what you'd expect for something this nasty. That ring is definitly Bad News.3) realisation of dreamsMckellen IS Gandalf. Thats how I always saw him in my minds eye, and now he's come to life, right before our eyes.

It has been several years, so I am not nit-picking details of the story.  However, this film has problems.I'll start off with the good, of which there was, to be fair, much.  The acting was above average with standout performances by Ian McKellan as Gandalf and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel (She has such great presence!  I was mesmerized whenever she was on the screen.).  The locations and sets were lush and lavish.  The action sequences were amazing in many parts. Stylistically, the director was hit and miss.  Often Jackson's shots were wonderfully realized, well framed, capturing a moment beautifully.  At other times they seemed to take more of a here's a thing approach (just point the camera at it) with all the style of an ambitious home movie (tilt the camera slightly and zoom in &#150; I'm thinking of the goblin and dwarf skeletons mostly here).  Positive stylistic standouts include Frodo's world when he dons the ring and Galadriel's moment of temptation to take the ring of power.  The changes in the story only added drama and character.  The subplot between Arwen and Aragorn is quite stirring.  The themes of the corrupting power of the ring played prominently in the film, which fueled an effective moral struggle throughout.To be fair, Mr. Jackson took on a colossal task that could never be perfect. The books are large and packed with characters and action.  Even a three-hour movie was bursting at the seams to contain what Jackson included. Another element that soured my experience is that I viewed this movie at what may be the worst movie theater of its kind in the world, the AMC 20 in Independence, Missouri, at which I have never viewed a movie I wanted to see without some kind of problem.  This go-around involved idiocy in the projection booth as the first half of the movie was framed so that we could only read the top half of the subtitles (maybe Elven only uses the top half of words remarked one of my friends), then it was fixed to show us the top part of the next frame at the bottom of the screen during the crucial Council of Elrond scene, and later adjusted to show only the top half of subtitles again.It has long been my contention that good movies take their time, an option that may have been unavailable to this film due to the incredible scope of its story.  But Jackson showed he could do this for the introductory Shire sequences, probably some of the more unimportant exchanges in the story. Once Gandalf goes to visit Saruman, however, the movie is off at breakneck speed, barely stopping to just be with its characters once in a while. Even rare moments of character development seem rushed as our heroes are quickly whisked away to the next chase\/fight\/escape.  For instance, as a reader, my version of meeting Strider is far different than the film's.  This is a scene that requires time.  We need a moment free of rising action to hear the sounds of the barroom, feel Frodo's tension, take note of the mysterious man in the corner.  Jackson's version runs in fast forward.  It goes like this (to be read at high speed with no breaths) Hey, who's that guy, he's been staring at us all night, oh him he's a ranger, call him Strider, hey you guys are calling attention to yourselves, let's get out of here, I'm Strider *running*.Obviously, going in, any director\/writer\/editor would know that time is a commodity in this story.  This being the case, I have issue with some of the decisions made in this film.  Much of the time, Jackson seems to be too in love with his sets and locations.  Countless are the sweeping, spinning shots of characters trekking across ever-changing terrain or taking in magnificent vistas.  With such a crunch for screen time, there were far too many.  For instance, I counted three separate sweeping\/spinning shots of the monolithic Gondor King statues (Yeah, Pete, we see 'em).  Less is more. Give us a quick establishing shot and then be with your characters in their environment.  We will figure out where they are, that it is beautiful and get more `precious' time with the characters.The key to good moviemaking is providing information.  Not too much or too little.  Too little information The Fellowship's trek. To the unread moviegoer, where is Rivendell in relation to Mordor?  Where's Saruman? Where are the Misty Mountains or the random passes debated as possible routes in the film?  A simple, quick lay-down-the-map scene would have provided this and created a real sense of quest for the audience.  For such an awesome undertaking there was no beginning, no moment of anticipation of the long road ahead or the adventures to come, just a random scene with Bilbo and Frodo at Rivendell, and we're walking.Too much information Reactions after escaping the mines.  Two or three tear-streaked faces are enough (e.g. everyone's sad).  An inventory of weeping characters we barely know set to melodramatic music is too much. As a side note, scores never bother me, but this one intruded into nearly every scene.  It only works once with a soft melody offsetting a grisly slow-motion action sequence.In summary, I found the direction to be oft inspiring, but at times heavy-handed (the score was perpetually so).  An example is Jackson's repetitive trading of shots back and forth between the Fellowship paddling and uruk hai warriors running.I probably took this movie more seriously than I should have, as I'm apt to do when presented with the screen adaptation of one of the greatest novels of our time.

An example is Jackson's repetitive trading of shots back and forth between the Fellowship paddling and uruk hai warriors running.I probably took this movie more seriously than I should have, as I'm apt to do when presented with the screen adaptation of one of the greatest novels of our time.  Most people that I've talked to found it `awesome!'  I'll give it a `good,' a `worth seeing,' and a `better luck next time.'

The magic it has, left a great impression on me. The creators of the famous &#145;Wallace and Gromit' series have made a real winner, a movie suitable for all ages, I guarantee it!While the chickens on evil Mrs Tweedy's farm dream of a better life, a clever hen named Ginger is hatching plans to fly the coop &#150; for good! The only problem is that chickens can't fly&#133; or can't they? Every escape attempt goes fowl until Rocky, a smooth talking All-American rooster, crash lands into the coop. It's hardly poultry in motion when Rocky attempts to teach Ginger and her fine feathered friends to fly&#133; but, with teamwork, determination and a little bit o' cluck, the fearless flock plots one last daring attempt in a spectacular bid for freedom!Where do you start with this wonderful movie. Undoubtedly the story is fantastic. The people who thought up the wonderful script for Chicken Run deserve a round of applause, because it was great. A story about a coop of chickens trying to escape from an evil chicken farm was superb. In addition some of the quotes that were said throughout  the film were hilarious, and make me laugh every time I watch it . This leads me to the great performances by the voiceovers in Chicken Run. My favourite character would have to be Rocky &#145;the Rhode Island Red' Rooster, and his voice was supplied by Hollywood superstar Mel Gibson. He did such a great job as Rocky, and made me laugh many times. I recently saw Gibson in What women want, and no wonder they used his voice in this film, because Rocky and Gibson have the similar personality and traits. Rocky's entrance cry of &#145;Freedommm'  is unforgettable. Yet other character such as chickens Ginger (Julia Sawalia), Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow),  Babs (Jane Horrocks),  Mac (Lynn Ferguson), The rats Nick (Timothy Spall) and Fetcher (Phil Daniels) and the Tweedy's (Miranda Richardson and Tony Haygarth) were all done to perfection. In fact, if Rocky was not in the film, then the Rats would be my favourites, with some of the silly things they say and do. Watch the credits right through, because there is an hilarious piece of dialogue between the two of them, which had me in stitches. Yet this movies also deals with some very complex ideologies. Liberals would absolutely love this film for the references to freedom, the individual and being able to do whatever a person wants, or in this case what a chicken wants. The strongest characters with these traits would have to be Rocky and Ginger. Yet Conservatism also appears heavily in Chicken Run. The character of Fowler is very much stuck in his conservative ways, always referring to how it was done in his RAF days, his medals and traditional stories. Moreover, Mr Tweedy states to Mrs Tweedy that they can not give up egg farming, because of his previous generations doing the same tradition. However, socialism also appears in this movie. Socialists believe that people should live in a classless society, with everyone working together. Chicken Run also put this into practices, when the coop attempts the big escape, by working as a team. The directors of Chicken Run, Nick Park and Peter Lord did a great job on Chicken Run, as did all the people behind the scenes. The people who made all the characters for this film did a wonderful job. Making this plasticine, into a real life character amazed me. In addition, learning that that 40 people worked individually on 2.5 seconds of frame work per day for two years, makes this film all the more of an achievement. Hopefully Lord and Park can make more movies like this one, because they did this one to perfection. The soundtrack in this film was also very impressive. The musical tunes made the right impression at the right time, along with some great songs as well. Songs such as  Flip Flop and Fly (Ellis Hall) and The Wanderer (Dion) fitted in nicely. The use of the song &#145;Flip Flop and Fly' was excellent.So overall, Chicken Run can only be given praise. All the hard work done to bring to the movie to the big screen is enough in my book. Yet the story, the humour and the great voiceovers are all superb. I have read some comments about Chicken Run, saying that it is just for kids, I disagree whole heartedly.This is the sort of animation film that anyone can enjoy. Try not to be too critical of Chicken Run, instead enjoy the experience, because if you can not enjoy this film then you have no sense of humour in my view. People with DVD access, take a look at one impressive package.Rating 10\/10 or 5 Eggs (it was eggcelent!)

The creators of the famous &#145;Wallace and Gromit' series have made a real winner, a movie suitable for all ages, I guarantee it!While the chickens on evil Mrs Tweedy's farm dream of a better life, a clever hen named Ginger is hatching plans to fly the coop &#150; for good! The only problem is that chickens can't fly&#133; or can't they? Every escape attempt goes fowl until Rocky, a smooth talking All-American rooster, crash lands into the coop. It's hardly poultry in motion when Rocky attempts to teach Ginger and her fine feathered friends to fly&#133; but, with teamwork, determination and a little bit o' cluck, the fearless flock plots one last daring attempt in a spectacular bid for freedom!Where do you start with this wonderful movie. Undoubtedly the story is fantastic. The people who thought up the wonderful script for Chicken Run deserve a round of applause, because it was great. A story about a coop of chickens trying to escape from an evil chicken farm was superb. In addition some of the quotes that were said throughout  the film were hilarious, and make me laugh every time I watch it . This leads me to the great performances by the voiceovers in Chicken Run. My favourite character would have to be Rocky &#145;the Rhode Island Red' Rooster, and his voice was supplied by Hollywood superstar Mel Gibson. He did such a great job as Rocky, and made me laugh many times. I recently saw Gibson in What women want, and no wonder they used his voice in this film, because Rocky and Gibson have the similar personality and traits. Rocky's entrance cry of &#145;Freedommm'  is unforgettable. Yet other character such as chickens Ginger (Julia Sawalia), Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow),  Babs (Jane Horrocks),  Mac (Lynn Ferguson), The rats Nick (Timothy Spall) and Fetcher (Phil Daniels) and the Tweedy's (Miranda Richardson and Tony Haygarth) were all done to perfection. In fact, if Rocky was not in the film, then the Rats would be my favourites, with some of the silly things they say and do. Watch the credits right through, because there is an hilarious piece of dialogue between the two of them, which had me in stitches. Yet this movies also deals with some very complex ideologies. Liberals would absolutely love this film for the references to freedom, the individual and being able to do whatever a person wants, or in this case what a chicken wants. The strongest characters with these traits would have to be Rocky and Ginger. Yet Conservatism also appears heavily in Chicken Run. The character of Fowler is very much stuck in his conservative ways, always referring to how it was done in his RAF days, his medals and traditional stories. Moreover, Mr Tweedy states to Mrs Tweedy that they can not give up egg farming, because of his previous generations doing the same tradition. However, socialism also appears in this movie. Socialists believe that people should live in a classless society, with everyone working together. Chicken Run also put this into practices, when the coop attempts the big escape, by working as a team. The directors of Chicken Run, Nick Park and Peter Lord did a great job on Chicken Run, as did all the people behind the scenes. The people who made all the characters for this film did a wonderful job. Making this plasticine, into a real life character amazed me. In addition, learning that that 40 people worked individually on 2.5 seconds of frame work per day for two years, makes this film all the more of an achievement. Hopefully Lord and Park can make more movies like this one, because they did this one to perfection. The soundtrack in this film was also very impressive. The musical tunes made the right impression at the right time, along with some great songs as well. Songs such as  Flip Flop and Fly (Ellis Hall) and The Wanderer (Dion) fitted in nicely. The use of the song &#145;Flip Flop and Fly' was excellent.So overall, Chicken Run can only be given praise. All the hard work done to bring to the movie to the big screen is enough in my book. Yet the story, the humour and the great voiceovers are all superb. I have read some comments about Chicken Run, saying that it is just for kids, I disagree whole heartedly.This is the sort of animation film that anyone can enjoy. Try not to be too critical of Chicken Run, instead enjoy the experience, because if you can not enjoy this film then you have no sense of humour in my view. People with DVD access, take a look at one impressive package.Rating 10\/10 or 5 Eggs (it was eggcelent!)

See my point.You have to take this adaptation for what it is, and what it is is a good old swords and sorcery flick with excellent acting, great plot, great characters and awesome visuals. Not to mention a score that would rival John Willams' for Star Wars. Jackson has brought to life the world all Tolkien readers know and love. He has taken great care in having Hobbits run around barefoot, even including the gift of Mithril Chain Mail from Bilbo to Frodo. A story inclusion that could have been completely cut. But it wasn't. Scenes like these were meant for the fans. Did Frodo really have to wake up and go to the mirror with Galdriel? Of course not, Jackson could have left that on the editing room floor as well. But he didn't.

A few things could have been included that weren't, and some of the Fellowship aren't quite as developed as one would like. But also think of this. This is only the first film of a TRILOGY! Think people, there will be around 7 more hours of film left to make Gimli, Legolas, and Merry and Pippin more interesting.

Forget the fact that the acting is brilliant, the special effects are mind-blowing, that the visual representation of the world will blow you away, and you have a awesome experience. Just the feeling a fan will get when seeing the opening scenes will be worth the price of admission, and a feeling he\/she will never forget. Go see it. You'll love it.

Yes it has a few problems, but do a few corny CGI shots really detract from a good movie?  I don't think so.I have seen a lot of complaining from people about characters being cut out, or changed, or undeveloped.  I can agree that it might be hard to understand the relationships between some of the characters, mostly between all of the hobbits.  However, Gimli and Legolas have a very complex relationship, but this doesn't begin to manifest itself until the second book, and so, the second movie.  I thought that the view that Elves and Dwarves don't get along was covered well at the Council of Elrond.  I also see the feud simmering between Aragorn and Boromir, in that Boromir really has no interest in Aragorn's standing.As far as the rest, I have no problem with the omissions of Tom Bombadil and Glorfindel, two characters from the books.  The only important thing that happens with Bombadil is the hobbits pick up their swords, which was handled easily enough by Aragorn.  And Glorfindel finds the hobbits and Aragorn heading to Rivendell and lets Frodo use his horse to get there faster, and then vanishes from the story.  Now we have Arwen carrying Frodo, establishing a character that does show up later in the story.  She doesn't have a big Xen-arwen fight like fanatics whine about, she just rides as fast as possible to get away from the Ringwraiths, JUST LIKE FRODO IN THE BOOK!The only problem I really have is, where did all the companions come from, anyway?

But now watching it years later (2006 I mean, despite what the date of this comment says) I watch it, having gone through lots of other film-viewing experience, and I like it a lot more. In a way what's really mesmerizing and heartbreaking about the picture is that the contrivances are not based in the actual script or story- not that there isn't one or two that might be hard to not have in there- but rather a sort of fashioning of continuous cinematic contrivance. In other words, Aronofsky pushes the bounds of everything that can be done with the camera and editing in terms of subjective-viewpoints, ideas through montage, and the power of abstractions in the realm of the main theme of the film- unattainable escapism. One might be tempted to compare to Eisenstein with the montage, but unlike him Arnonofsky isn't putting forward a political message, but a societal one. While the cinematography by Matthew Libatique and the editing by Jay Rambinowitz give the viewer the whole subjective, jarring view of what it feels like in the first person to do these dangerous drugs, some of the time, all this being says, it almost goes by too quickly (if you blink you'll miss the characters actually intaking the drugs, which are done in half second cuts). Not that that's a bad thing, and in fact the techniques used here, which include fast-motion, camera-strapped-on-the-front-of-a-person shots, odd high-angle placements, and wild array of things done that I still wonder how one could think them up, are quite ingenious. Only one scene on a repeat viewing- when Sarah Goldfarb (Burtyn) is going totally off the deep-end in her apartment with the TV show spiraling around her- doesn't totally work for me.Also, it will be difficult for some people to view the characters in their dissension to demise. Bustyn, (who, if you still believe the Oscars to really be a mark of merit for true achievements, proves this to be false via her loss to the much less warranted Julia Robert) plays an old, lonely woman who dreams of getting on a game-show that she doesn't realize might not be real and decides her favorite red dress is all that matters for the show to the show. It's too small, so she goes to the doctor to get pills (uppers) and they do indeed work, but then she starts taking too, too many and ends up hallucinating that her refrigerator is moving (the first film to use a refrigerator puppeteer by the way) and then things start to spiral. This also goes for her entranged son Harry (Jared Leto) who is slipping into a descent into smack with his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) who sleeps with other men and then some in order to get stuff when Harry can, and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans in his best performance to date) who is also descending, but might seem to have it not as bad as the others by the time the film ends.But like I said, it is hard to view these characters falling deeper and deeper into insanity and desperation and all since it is also difficult to sympathize with these people. Yet, by the end of the film I almost felt like I was going to burst into tears not because I felt sad for the characters but more because of how powerful there journey led then to their destination.

And boring. So...so boring.I'm sure the books were better. They have to be. Did the book have character development? 'cause this didn't. Okay, Gandalf had character. Frodo had... the ring. Then there were 7 or 8 other guys who may or may not have names, i don't know. I don't care.

Still entertaining after all these years!SPOILERS, but further down in this review. Moulin Rouge caught me totally off guard. It is not a re-make of anything. It does not purport to tell any historically-accurate story. It is set in 1899 and 1900 Paris, at the Moulin Rouge entertainment complex, owner and show-master Zidler (Jim Broadbent) was a real person. Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo) was primarily a painter that visited brothels, and died in 1901. However, the main characters Satine (Nicole Kidman, 34) the courtesan and entertainer, Christian (Ewan McGregor, 30) the young writer, and the jealous Duke are all fictional.What caught me off-guard is the style. It is a dream-scape fairytale, it is whimsical, it is a comedy with some tragedy thrown in at the climax. It is two hours of exotic music videos with dialog thrown in to bridge the musical numbers. It is what a Salvadore Dali musical would look like, if he had been a director instead of artist. Everything is shot on a large inside set in Australia, and combined with models and CG effects, blended seamlessly to create an auditory and visual display rarely seen on film. In fact, the whole film reminds me more of an elaborate stage production with lots of set changes. I really enjoyed it, I watched it twice, on successive days. I rate it 9 of 10.Director and writer Luhrmann uses a simple and easy to follow story. Christian is idealistic, moves to Paris to write about truth, beauty, freedom, and especially LOVE. Even though he's never been in love. Lautrec and his cronies, bohemians, are struck with Christian's ability to write beautiful poetry, actually words from 20th century love songs from the likes of Beatles, Estevan, Parton, Elton John. They want him to write the new musical Spectacular Spectacular, he falls in love with Satine, the Duke agrees to finance renovations to the Moulin Rouge, but Zidler must promise him Satine or forfeit the deed to the place. Much of the middle of the film deals with Satine and Christian's trying to carry on a love affair while keeping it from the jealous Duke.Some viewers, not understanding the concept, objected to the use of modern lyrics in an 1899 Parisian setting. As Luhrmann explains, for the story to work, the poetry that Christian writes must be by consensus some of the most beautiful of all time. The only way to do that is to use lyrics of songs that have, by popular acclaim, become the best. All You Need Is Love. Silly Love Song. And all the others. Since the whole film is a comedic dream-scape fantasy, it works!The film starts at the end, with Christian in 1900 writing his story of the past year. He tells us in the first scene that the woman he fell in love with is dead. So we don't have that suspense during the film, we know how it will end. The whole fun is letting our senses be taken in, and just enjoy watching the story unfold. Satine dies on stage, at the end of the opening performance of Spectacular Spectacular. And, in the last scene, Christian is completing his story, on his typewriter, about the need for love in our lives.Neither Kidman nor McGregor had ever sung professionally before, in any capacity. For actors they did quite well, although it is very clear that they are not singers. In particular, McGregor's shouted out high notes, done without any vibrato, became pretty irritating after a while. Yet, with a little more training, he could be good enough to play Elton John, if someone wanted to film his life story. But the best singer overall was Jim Broadbent, with a very fine, resonant and lyrical voice. That was a pleasant surprise.Anyone watching Moulin Rouge at home on videotape is missing about 75% of the fun. The DVD has great picture and sound, with either Dolby or DTS digital surround tracks selectable. The extra on the first disk puts a green fairy at several points and if you press enter on the player's remote, takes you to a couple of minutes of behind-the-scenes explanations, which I found very enjoyable on second viewing. The second disk has a lot more extras, showing about everything one wants to know about the making of this film. I like to study, not just watch, a good film, and this DVD has some of the best extras I've seen so far.And finally, it is refreshing to see a fine film with no nudity, no curse words, and no killing. My hat off to Luhrmann, I wish more directors and writers would realize how clean good movies can be.

Sure, heroism doesn't mean it's a pro-war movie but this movie goes beyond that. It's little surprise that the military are among the biggest fans of this movie. It may not celebrate war as a something good, but then, I can't think of any film that does outside of propaganda movies. If you want an anti war movie that shows heroism and mateship without celebrating the military, watch All Quiet on the Western Front.It does follow the standard American war movie characterisation rather faithfully. The Germans are universally evil, other nations are either non-existent, villains or locals who get saved by the Americans. Well in this case it is not that far from the truth, without the Americans the war would have gone on much longer than it did and the Germans were villains. But all these facts are distorted and stereotyped in a bad way here. For example, the only German with a sizeable speaking role turns out to be a total coward and backstabber who repays the Americans who saved his life by shooting them. There are a couple of good points to the movie though. It does deviate somewhat from the standard US heroic movies in that it shows that Americans committed war crimes too, like shooting soldiers who had already surrendered. There are also some quite powerful scenes that are as good as any Spielberg has done. Best among them is the scene where a father in a French village tries to pass his daughter to one of the soldiers to save her. This single scene can probably verify this movie's claim to show the horrors of war somewhat. The landing in the Normandy is good, although somewhat overrated. I wasn't there so I can't comment on the realism but it felt like this was close to what it was really like. Many people were upset that the movie only shows Americans fighting the Germans, but for once, this is not really a valid argument since the various armies fought in different areas and would have had very little contact amongst each other. The movie really goes downhill towards the end though when the troop actually find Ryan. Instead of being glad to be out of this hell, he wants to stay there to help out his comrades. Very anti war indeed. This is where the movie turns totally Hollywood and looses all claim it may have had to a somewhat realistic portrayal. A number of people had died already in trying to find Ryan and his decision to stay there costs another couple of people their lifes yet the movie makes him a total hero for it. Steven Spielberg is capable of making great movies, this isn't one of them.The acting is not particularly good and leaves out no cliches.

There are jabs at probably a couple dozen other movies.  I'm all for making fun of movies, and certainly there is a lot to make fun of in some of these films (Down to You I'm looking at you).  But in order to make fun of a film, you yourself have to be smarter than the subject matter you are mocking.  And I'm not entirely convinced this film is there.The potential for truly intelligent satire might have been here, we'll never know.  The biggest problem is the creators truly underestimate their audience.  After almost every joke, there is an explanation for the joke. For example, in one of the few smart bits, a character tries to start a cliched slow, building applause.  But because he does it at such an inopportune moment, it doesn't work.  Very funny.  But then a character comes over (Oddly, Melissa Joan Hart in a cameo) and explains that that won't work now, and he's got to wait for the right moment.  Very unfunny. Give us a little credit; we get the joke, we don't need our hands held.This hurts the movie because parody works best when its characters aren't in on the joke.  In Blazing Saddles, the townspeople don't go Oh that man is tricking us by holding a gun to his own neck.  They go Would someone help that poor man?!?  In NATM every character is completely aware of themselves, and so instead of building off of stereotypes, they are mired in them.  For instance, the black character knows he's only supposed to say silly retorts that add nothing to the conversation.  Funny when he explains it; not funny when for the rest of the movie he actually only says those three things.  Instead, why not have the character only say three things, and then have other characters question him on his bizarre behavior.  Same goes for Bruce, a white kid who thinks he is Chinese, funny at first, not funny for the last seventy minutes of the film.  The foreign exchange student character probably sounded funny on paper, but it's so over the top it's downright exploitative.I liked a few of performances; the character of Ox is an incredible impression of Chris Klein in every movie he's in.  And the film makes excellent use of its soundtrack; all the moments they are making fun of have the original songs in the background (Kiss Me when the ugly duckling walks down the stairs in slo-mo, for example).

And I'm not entirely convinced this film is there.The potential for truly intelligent satire might have been here, we'll never know.  The biggest problem is the creators truly underestimate their audience.  After almost every joke, there is an explanation for the joke. For example, in one of the few smart bits, a character tries to start a cliched slow, building applause.  But because he does it at such an inopportune moment, it doesn't work.  Very funny.  But then a character comes over (Oddly, Melissa Joan Hart in a cameo) and explains that that won't work now, and he's got to wait for the right moment.  Very unfunny. Give us a little credit; we get the joke, we don't need our hands held.This hurts the movie because parody works best when its characters aren't in on the joke.  In Blazing Saddles, the townspeople don't go Oh that man is tricking us by holding a gun to his own neck.  They go Would someone help that poor man?!?  In NATM every character is completely aware of themselves, and so instead of building off of stereotypes, they are mired in them.  For instance, the black character knows he's only supposed to say silly retorts that add nothing to the conversation.  Funny when he explains it; not funny when for the rest of the movie he actually only says those three things.  Instead, why not have the character only say three things, and then have other characters question him on his bizarre behavior.  Same goes for Bruce, a white kid who thinks he is Chinese, funny at first, not funny for the last seventy minutes of the film.  The foreign exchange student character probably sounded funny on paper, but it's so over the top it's downright exploitative.I liked a few of performances; the character of Ox is an incredible impression of Chris Klein in every movie he's in.  And the film makes excellent use of its soundtrack; all the moments they are making fun of have the original songs in the background (Kiss Me when the ugly duckling walks down the stairs in slo-mo, for example).

Where there's lots of dark lighting and really quick camera moves to cover up inadequate scenery or costumes? Remember, the movie where bad things pop out from behind walls, and if you didn't already know the story you're completely lost after the first 15 minutes?Look, I've read the book three times. The detail and rich textures that Tolkien describes are what make the story so interesting. To leave out so much information and film mostly orc-action because it sells well has turned the story to nothing we haven't seen before. All of the names for people, places, and things that Tolkien invented that convey a sense of completeness to Middle Earth are mostly missing here. Perhaps it's not possible to include them, you'd end up with a five hour movie instead of three. If that's the case, then I say, don't make the movie! When I learned that the whole two chapters that deal with Tom Bombidil were deleted, I wondered how the screenwriter would extricate the Hobbits from the Old Forest and the Barrow Wights. Easy, they're not there either. The beauty of Lothlorien is passed through within minutes, Bilbo's party looks to be one fourth as big as it should have been, and way too short. The movie speeds so quickly from scene to scene that there is no buildup of character for any aspect of the film. Was anything good? The casting turned out better than I thought it would, though Frodo is supposed to be in his early fifties, not half that. The Elves are pretty good, John Rhys-Davies turns into a squat Dwarf through some movie magic, and Gandalf and Saruman suffice. Let's not even discuss the appearance of Arwen, who is mentioned in the book, has no lines, and only exists in the appendix, yet obviously will be a presence throughout the production. The Orcs look more like some guys who played a very muddy rugby game. They are far too humanized. Hey, what happened to the good stuff? I got off track, which is what Lord of the Rings does quite nicely, it gets way off track from being a romantic story good versus evil and the reasoning behind it, and shows us mostly cowboys and injuns. I swear I saw an Imperial Stormtrooper flash by.

After all Renee Zellwegger did work hard at the role, putting on weight, an English accent and all and appearing quite convincing in both. And Hugh Grant did a rather good job playing the bad guy. However much I hated Daniel Cleaver, at least it was not one of those idiotic fumbling characters that he usually plays. But methinks, Colin Firth stole the show! He's never looked so good, so perfect on screen before! This movie had him reprise the role of Mr. Darcy, the handsome elusive prince charming, who initially seems like a pompous know-it-all and ends up being Mr. Ideal himself. I like you, just the way you are. Sigh...Too Idealistic, actually... Colin Firth's come a long way, you would would never imagine him being such good lead if you had only seen 'Circle of Friends' or 'Shakespeare in Love', two movies in which plays a chauvinist to boot! I haven't read any of the Bridget Jones books, so I don't really know how Sharon Maguire has gone about adapting the novels to screen. To me it seemed like a modern reworking of 'Pride and Prejudice' with an overweight Elizabeth Bennett(minus the sisters, thankfully). But the movie is still thoroughly enjoyable and even re-watchable! The music is excellent! It features some really beautiful songs like Gabrielle's 'Out of Reach', Sheryl Crow's 'Kiss that Girl', Robbie Williams's 'Not of this Earth' and Shelby Lynne's 'Dreamsome'(the song played as Bridget and Darcy are making the blue soup! This one's a personal favorite!) And there's of course Geri Halliwell's 'It's Raining Men' which is just too good! Worth mentioning is also the theme of the movie composed by Patrick Doyle. The tunes are so beautiful and enchanting, they elevate the movie and the listener up to some ethereal world! All in all, buy the soundtrack and see more Colin Firth films!

Therefore I have nothing to measure this movie up to (as far as how it relates the books).Let me start by saying that this was a very good movie. The action sequences were incredible (the fight in the mines was simply fantastic), and the special effects were amazing. I do like the story, the acting was great, and the cinematography was better then expected.All of this has been said by plenty of people before, so there's no use in rehashing why the movie is good. Therefore, what follows is my critique about its failings.There are three to be precise. First of all, I did think that the movie dragged on a bit in certain points. I understand that the movie has a lot of background and character development to do, but I found myself shifting in my seat on more then one occasion.Secondly, I didn't like the way that 9 people could so easily cut through several armies of orcs and goblins. The whole story is built upon how the elves, dwarves, and humans would be toast when Sauron came to power, but they seem to have no problems with the enemy. Just send 20 guys in and they appear to be more then enough to kill thousands of orcs. The Ring Wraiths were turned away by a single human in one encounter, and a single elf in another. That doesn't inspire fear...Third, the ending leaves a lot to be desired. Why did Frodo decide that he did not want to travel with the Fellowship anymore? How come the ending showed that the Fellowship does not work? It left me thinking that SOME kind of event should have happened. Yes, I know its a trilogy, but so was Star Wars, and they were able to destroy the Death Star in the first movie. Especially since part two is a year away.With all of those short-comings, I cannot give this movie a rating higher then 7\/10. Perhaps the next two will improve this.
