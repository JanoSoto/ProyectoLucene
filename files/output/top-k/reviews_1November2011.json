I was the ultimate fan of The Sixth Sense, and a quite supporter of The Village, however these films didn't stay with me and excite me as much as other classics, but then Night created Unbreakable. It took me a long time to get round to watch this film, but the wait just made it even more special. this film is unlike any other superhero film. It demonstrates the superhero concept in such a unique, quite and intelligent way that you will be left thinking and amazed by the twist and storyline. once again a superb performance from one of the best in the business - Bruce Willis. His performance perfectly demonstrated the shock and scepticism that would initially hit any normal being in such a scenario; and this was aided by the brilliant direction of Night for all the cast, but Bruce's performance was truly stunning and compelling. Samuel L. Jackson also had a stunning performance as Elijah Price, a comic book enthuasist who initially discovers David Dunn's amazing and unique quality. Also new kid on the block Spencer Treat Clark acted superbly as the son of David, Joseph. Such good acting from a young lad, and is definitely one to look out for in the future. Typical of a Night film, suspense is gradually built up throughout the movie, and this increases the impact at the unbelievable ending of the film. Night made a superb decision by recruiting James Newton Howard as the composer. James created a totally new, unique and simply epic soundtrack for the film, exactly what Night wanted. The soundtrack really helps Night portray the point of the film, and really deepens the impact on the viewer at the end of the movie. Unbreakable is a brilliantly unique film, mainly due to the way that the superhero is portrayed. But the aspect of the film that makes it truly unique and shocking is the typical twisted ending. This ending will literally leave you breathless, due to the unexpected story twist, the excellent acting from Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis, and the superb soundtrack from James Newton Howard. This film will leave you breathless, and will stay with you for a long time after you watch it. Unforgettable! But watching this film will leave you feeling very hollow and a sense of sadness for two simple reasons Night will never make a film with such an impact like this again, and you will never see a film with the superhero concept portrayed like this again. Quite frankly, 7.3 doesn't do this film justice. Decide for yourself, if you can appreciate a good film, you will most certainly agree with me.

I didn't know what to make of it. I saw some kind of spaceship that looked like an over-sized reject from a Jaque Coustou undersea special, a suped up truck with fins and a rocket, a bunch of scenes and characters that were as eclectic as a Bon Jovi fan at a Fatboy's concert, and a strange yet memorable tune that you could whistle in your sleep.I of course speak of none other than Buckaroo Banzai across the 8th Dimension. A film I remember simply for the fact that it was a let down and a triumph all at once. A film made with a market of the wink- and-a-nod crowd in mind; i.e. folks who get the joke, or want to get the joke, or love being in on the joke and want to be part of the crowd that's in on the joke. It's the kind of film that plays to the I know what's going on crowd, who then laugh at the antics of characters frolicking across the big silver screen ... allegedly.The truth is it's just a simple silly and harmless film that tries to have fun. There's moments that are completely off the wall, and because they're so outlandish that you either buy into it and smirk (maybe even laugh), or you simply reject it out of hand as being bad because your brain refuses to digest the material being presented.It's that kind of a film.So, did I like it? Eh, I can't say I enjoyed it a whole lot when I first saw it. In fact I remember telling my friend in his Capri how much I detested the thing, and him reminding me how much I said I wanted to see it. Okay. Touche. He got me. I did want to see it. And when I did, hoping to see something really out there in terms of adventure, I got a veritable trip down fantasy lane. Yet at the same time I did begrudgingly smile at Buckaroo's entourage and their adventures and misadventures. And who could forget the likes of John Smallberries or John Yaya, or their employer; Yoyodyne Industries? I mean with an all star 80's cast, how could you go wrong? Again, you had to be in the right frame of mind to watch the thing ... and perhaps the right age; i.e. a teenager who thinks he knows everything about the world, and wants to see a film poke fun at all the values that have been spoon fed to him from previous cinematic offerings. That film is Buckaroo Banzai across the 8th Dimension.Buckaroo Banzai pokes fun at all of the adventure and sci-fi flicks that came out up to that time, and plays to the audience that thinks they know better than other audience members and even the film makers themselves as to what the film is really about. Okay. That means that the film is trying to make the target audience feel good by boosting the cleverness faction of their ego. Is that a bad thing? Only if you get hung up on the film and that general mindset. But even here the film pulls and pokes at the veneer of that kind of thinking, and turns what might have been a serious sci-fi adventure into a quirky rollick. Otherwise, like I said, the film is harmless. It ranges from good laughs to the absurd, and all colors of the cinematic spectrum in between.The actors do their job, the technical credits are solid, no miscues anywhere for anything, not even the script. A good solid Hollywood production.If you want to see something different, are feeling a little superior about movies to everyone else, have a hankerin for an adventure film about a super cool hero who's too cool to be real and has managed to coral the oddest bunch of characters under his tutelage and leadership, then give Buckaroo a chance.Otherwise, watch at your own risk.

All of the classic elements of film noir are on full display in Out Of The Past, including story filling flashbacks, gritty gangsters, and the obligatory femme fatal. So, to start, the first thing that I really noticed about this film was its excellent cinematography. Every shot seemed exceedingly well put together, with no minute detail left to chance. The excellent use of contrasting light to typify the different characters in their relation not only to each other, but to the story as whole was first rate. The rough feel of a something so polished is an odd exception to the other film noir films of that era. The film, while at the outset seeming slow and rustic, never really loses its, for lack of a better term,  gritty feel. As a viewer, you are drawn to this world of mobsters and mayhem, risk and redemption. It is hard not to be with the caliber of acting present in this film. What an outstanding case. Obviously as a viewer, one would expect the big name actors, Robert Mitchum, Jane Greer, and Kirk Douglas, to deliver great performances (which they do), but the all around supporting cast was just as equally enjoyable to watch. Of those worth particular mention would be Paul Valentine as Joe Stephanos, as well as Rhonda Fleming as Meta Carson. These supporting actors and their role in the story is what for me made this movie a true classic. Lastly, I enjoyed the plot itself. To be sure, it reminded me a bit of the film A History Of Violence with Viggo Mortensen, but it was still great. The double crossing of double crossers who double crossed in the first place was admittedly a little hard to follow at first, but the film does an excellent job of keeping things in order. This is truly a credit to the writers and director. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would definitely recommend it to others.

Growing up I was lucky to have grown up in a very nice town, that actually had kind of the same divide between the Preps and the working class blokes.

I remember being around nine-years-old when my parents took me to see this film and I remember falling asleep. In fact, I tried to revisit it twice the following year and fell asleep both times yet again. It was a few years later when I gave the film another shot and while I enjoyed bits and pieces of it I still couldn't love the film like so many do. With this most recent viewing I once again found myself entertained by parts of it but in the end I think there's just way too much style and not enough substance to really carry and save the day. There are countless good things to really enjoy here including the rather dark vision of Burton. Many people seem to be upset that the light, comic book tone has been turned into some rather dark, dirty and depressing but I think the visual look of the streets, the bat cave and the rundown city is highly effective and it certainly creates a terrific atmosphere. There's just so much detail down to the smallest thing that you really must give the director and production crew credit for going all out. Another major plus are the performances, which are exceptionally well done. This includes smaller roles played by the likes of Jack Palance, Robert Wuhl, Pat Hingle and Billy Dee Williams. Kim Basinger plays the love interest and I've always been a bit torn on her performance. I think she's fine in the part but her character suffers from some really bland writing that really doesn't give the actress a chance to bring the character to life. Keaton seems to be debated on by fans but I thought he was fine. I think he's more believable and better at playing Bruce Wayne. Nicholson, on the other hand, turns in one of the best performances of his career and while watching the film you really can't help but wish that the entire movie featured him. I think Nicholson is so great in his part that it really hurts the film whenever he's not on screen. It says a lot that one performance can capture an entire film but Nicholson's wacky, fun and just downright bizarre performance does just that. I do think one of the film's biggest problems is that the Bruce Wayne\/Batman role isn't given enough great moments to really stand out. I always think it's a problem whenever you enjoy watching the villain much more than the hero.

It's a more comported film about people behaving like mature adults, without succumbing to the urge to be a child with raging hormones. But the theatre of the 70s was a different animal than today's teenage market model.Neil Simon's play, translated to the screen, is full of wit and verve. It is funny without condescending to body functions, nor explicit sex for the sake of shock (which has lost its shock altogether). We're seeing the courting of a couple, both of whom are fighting to hold onto their dreams and stay in the world they know and love without succumbing to defeat.Challenges are made and met, mostly from the couple that fight, vie and come to a state of détente and acceptance. Both Dreyfus and Mason are high energy and outrageous without being stupid and insulting (again, unlike so many of today's contemporary films). Watching this film I'm reminded of the adults that used to pervade society on all levels. I can also feel, see, sense and smell the set of the small apartment in New York; the art direction and lighting design are that good. Throw in some very competent actors, and you got yourself one great photplay waiting to be shown. I used to hate and bemoan the 70s, but this film reminded me that those years weren't so bad. If I had a critique of the film, it's Simon's writing style. It's full of more wit than I think most people can readily absorb. He's almost too funny at times. It's the kind of thing that's both his trademark and his bane. Referencing a non-sexual double entente and political ongoings of the era were zestful. It was an age when information was more filtered, though prevalent, yet delivered at a wiser pace to allow for mental digestion. But Simon bucks the trend of the time by delivering wit fast and furious. It was, and still is, considered great art and genius. Though at times it can be silly.An actor and a former hoofer with a daughter? Can it work? Well, you probably know the answer to that one, but it's the journey that's the actual joy. An old fashioned film for an old fashioned time, when technology, though present, didn't pigeon hole personality types into discreet demographics. In short, this film is made for most everyone.Ah, and I haven't given one of these in a while, there are a couple of marginally racy scenes.

In terms of story, the second half is much better than the first. The second half has some good writing and picks up the pace, the first half on the other hand is in my opinion unexciting and pedestrian with too many overlong scenes that could've been trimmed easily. The Alamo is perhaps 15 minutes too long, the pace is often dull particularly at the start and for a lengthy movie you'd expect more character development than this.

He has carved his way through eight sequels, a remake, and a remake of a sequel, and he is the first major horror movie villain to inspire other classics to follow in his wake(Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street). But to really know who Michael Myers is, to understand why he frightens us, you have to go back to 1978, when John Carpenter released a low-budget independent horror film that not only gave birth to an icon, but stood the test of time after more than 30 years as one of the scariest movies of all time. That movie is Halloween.The story is extremely simple In 1963, a six year old boy murders his sister, Judith Myers, in cold blood with a kitchen knife. After 15 years of confinement to Smith's Grove Sanitarium, the killer escapes and heads to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois, with Dr. Sam Loomis(played magnificently by Donald Pleasence) in desperate pursuit. Enter Laurie Strode(played by Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends Annie and Lynda. It is October 31st, and Laurie and Annie are babysitting in houses right across from each other while ditsy Lynda messes around with her boyfriend Bob. What they don't know is the killer has targeted them and has some pretty gruesome plans for this Halloween night.Such a bare-bones plot could have resulted in an average exploitation film a la The Hills Have Eyes or Black Christmas. But, obviously, John Carpenter and Debra Hill had other, more serious intentions when they wrote their script and filmed the movie. With a tiny budget of just $300,000, they were out to make a horror film that would transcend the way we looked at the genre. And it did. Halloween still terrifies, with its mind-numbing suspense, its creepy villain, a fantastic cast, and a nightmarish musical score.When it comes to supernatural forces, John Carpenter knows the way to any movie buff's fear factor, after such films as The Fog and Christine. Halloween was Carpenter's first major film, and he knew exactly what he was doing when he created the character of Michael Myers, or let's just say 'The Shape.' The character may be a human being (isn't it always more scary when a killer is human?), but he is not seen that way by his creator or the audience. Michael is frightening because he almost gets a kick out of killing his victims. He plays psychological games with them until the time comes for them to die. Michael is treated as a furiously violent force of nature, a predator that can be anywhere at anytime, ready to strike. His strength is overwhelming, his lack of emotion is shocking, and his inability to die makes him all the more spine-tingling. That is why he is called 'The Shape' in the first film.We never need to see Michael's face, and we barely do. Everything that we're afraid of can be projected on his choice of visage. The mask that he wears(originally a Captain Kirk mask that was spray-painted white, with the hair teased and eye-holes widened) is disturbingly expressionless, allowing the viewer to project anything they want on it.As suspenseful as the movie is, the score(composed by Carpenter himself) is almost just as effective. The recurring musical themes symbolize evil, the feeling that something horrible is approaching us from a dark corner or at our front door. No shrieking violins are found here, but Carpenter's simplistic music makes the movie more chilling.Later over-analyzed in the Final Destination movies, Halloween subtly hints at the subject of fate. The film has something to say. It tells us that fate is inescapable, that no matter what, some form of evil or death will come for you, whether it's watching you from outside, or crossing the street, or staring at you from a backyard.Dean Cundey's cinematography is something worth noting. The film takes place almost entirely at night, making the streets of Haddonfield and the Doyle and Wallace houses a little abnormally dark. This allows for our villain to creep into the shadows and watch from places you can't see him.The cast is pure gold. Back in 1978, the choice to cast an important cinematic performer in a horror film kind of brought some skepticism. Donald Pleasence was an exception. He could have portrayed Sam Loomis(the name of Janet Leigh's boyfriend in Psycho) in a cheesy way with over-acted dialog. But Pleasence wouldn't allow it. He plays Loomis with great intensity, the fear that Michael will kill again evident in his eyes. Annie and Lynda are played by Nancy Loomis and PJ Soles(famous for Brian De Palma's Carrie). Both are played very realistically and sympathetically, especially by Soles. She is funny and a joy to watch. Her death is disquieting because of that.And then there's Laurie Strode. Halloween marked the debut of Jamie Lee Curtis, and for an actress that doesn't exactly love the horror genre, she makes for a flawless heroine. Thanks to Curtis, Laurie is human and likable. We don't want to see her die. We want to see her triumph and fight back. She is our protector. This role was meant for Curtis from the beginning, and being Psycho star Janet Leigh's daughter, she knows how to scream!Overall, what hasn't been said about Halloween that hasn't been said by everyone else? The movie is a horror masterpiece, a classic that no slasher follow-up, not even the wonderfully entertaining Friday the 13th, can possibly beat. Not including part 3, this movie franchise is a ball for all genre enthusiasts, even Rob Zombie's films. Like Michael Myers, Halloween will never die. After more than 30 years, I think it's safe to say, I quote the character of Tommy Doyle, that you can't kill the boogeyman.

That alone is good for a positive rating in my book. Indeed this is pretty much a visual poem from beginning to end. Filming in natural light using a lot of low-light and back-lit images is very effective.In some ways the beauty of the filming works against the movie, since that is the primary feature of the film that most react to. But there is more here than innovative filming.The turn of the century photos under the opening credits set the tone of what is to come and they cleverly end with a photo of Linda Manz who plays Linda, the young teen who tells the tale. The story covers a little over a year in Linda's life spent with her brother Bill, his lover Abby, and a rich Texas farmer (Sam Shepard). In the opening scene Bill kills his boss in an angry scuffle in a steel mill in Chicago and he and Abby and Linda go on the lam to the Texas panhandle where they work as laborers harvesting wheat on a farmer's 20,000 acres. The relationship that develops between Abby, Bill, and the farmer is an interesting twist on the love triangle--a con that precipitates tragic unintended consequences.This is very much a period piece, taking place during 1916-1917. The entry of the United States into WWI comes into play only late in the film, affording Abby an opportunity to live up to her promise to lead a good life and make up for the wrongs she has done; on an impulse she drops her belongings and boards a troop train.Malick gives us a glimpse of the life of migrant workers of the time that seems realistic, complete with period tractors, combines, and threshers. Also on hand are period autos, wagons, and planes. Linda summarizes the status of the workers plight with the statements, You didn't work the'd ship you right outta' there. The don't need you. They can always get somebody else.Most of the dialog in the movie comes from voice-overs given by Linda in her raspy, flat voice. Manz's voice perfectly fits her personality, or maybe it establishes her personality. She speaks with a disarming directness and lack of guile. She has good lines like, I'm tellin' you, the rich got it figured out. Linda seems like a woman who can handle anything that life hands her, but she does say, You're only on this Earth once. And I, to my opinion, as long as you're around you should have it nice.I thought all the actors were in good form. Given the minimal dialog they were able to communicate underlying emotions through body language and facial expressions. I particularly liked Robert Wilke who played the farm foreman, I wish he could have had a larger role. The farmer remained a mystery. How did he come to be so rich, a handsome single man living in isolation on his large farm? I did have a few problems with this movie. Bill and Linda pretending to be siblings rather than lovers is crucial to the plot, but I found that ruse a bit hard to buy. Linda says it is supposedly because people start talking. But the pretend relationship does not stop people from talking, quite the contrary. And how did Bill escape from hiding behind that medical van without being seen? It makes for good scenery that southern Alberta, Canada, is substituted for Texas, but there are no mountains in the Texas panhandle as are seen in the distance in several scenes. A bison herd in Texas in 1916 is a bit problematic. I think this movie is not aimed at the literal minded.Nature plays an essential role; the scenes of birds, animals, landscapes, storms, man in nature, man on the landscape, are stunningly beautiful.

But there is more here than innovative filming.The turn of the century photos under the opening credits set the tone of what is to come and they cleverly end with a photo of Linda Manz who plays Linda, the young teen who tells the tale. The story covers a little over a year in Linda's life spent with her brother Bill, his lover Abby, and a rich Texas farmer (Sam Shepard). In the opening scene Bill kills his boss in an angry scuffle in a steel mill in Chicago and he and Abby and Linda go on the lam to the Texas panhandle where they work as laborers harvesting wheat on a farmer's 20,000 acres. The relationship that develops between Abby, Bill, and the farmer is an interesting twist on the love triangle--a con that precipitates tragic unintended consequences.This is very much a period piece, taking place during 1916-1917. The entry of the United States into WWI comes into play only late in the film, affording Abby an opportunity to live up to her promise to lead a good life and make up for the wrongs she has done; on an impulse she drops her belongings and boards a troop train.Malick gives us a glimpse of the life of migrant workers of the time that seems realistic, complete with period tractors, combines, and threshers.

They can always get somebody else.Most of the dialog in the movie comes from voice-overs given by Linda in her raspy, flat voice. Manz's voice perfectly fits her personality, or maybe it establishes her personality. She speaks with a disarming directness and lack of guile. She has good lines like, I'm tellin' you, the rich got it figured out. Linda seems like a woman who can handle anything that life hands her, but she does say, You're only on this Earth once. And I, to my opinion, as long as you're around you should have it nice.I thought all the actors were in good form. Given the minimal dialog they were able to communicate underlying emotions through body language and facial expressions. I particularly liked Robert Wilke who played the farm foreman, I wish he could have had a larger role. The farmer remained a mystery. How did he come to be so rich, a handsome single man living in isolation on his large farm? I did have a few problems with this movie. Bill and Linda pretending to be siblings rather than lovers is crucial to the plot, but I found that ruse a bit hard to buy. Linda says it is supposedly because people start talking. But the pretend relationship does not stop people from talking, quite the contrary. And how did Bill escape from hiding behind that medical van without being seen? It makes for good scenery that southern Alberta, Canada, is substituted for Texas, but there are no mountains in the Texas panhandle as are seen in the distance in several scenes. A bison herd in Texas in 1916 is a bit problematic. I think this movie is not aimed at the literal minded.Nature plays an essential role; the scenes of birds, animals, landscapes, storms, man in nature, man on the landscape, are stunningly beautiful.

He calls her honey every thirty seconds, as in, Now just take a deep breath and calm down, Honey. Even I, as a man, found this disgustingly condescending.

Every time I watch it I understand it more and more, and I'm saddened by the fact that the people who dislike or misrepresent the film are missing out on the truths permeating the subtext of this film. There is subtly underlying the drug induced madness that captures the essential essence of a long drawn out acid trip. It manages to portray the drug culture for what it is, nothing less nothing more. Exposing some fundamental truths that many seekers seem to miss or just ignore. The desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force - is tending the light at the end of the tunnel.  is what Johnny Depp's character says, and it ties together the madness quite well. There is no truth to be found, there is no great secret, there is no force tending the light at the end of the tunnel, there is no point. Self proclaimed psychonauts will disagree with me. They fundamentally believe that there is something to be learnt from these drugs. As a drug hobbyist myself I firmly believe that there is nothing to be gained from these narcotics apart from heavy stimulation and hedonistic madness. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas takes this point and exposes it in an amusing surrealist way that can really only truly be appreciated if you yourself have cowered in sheer horror and wonder at the world around you while your mind is whispering quadruple entendre and exposing you to things through a very confusing lysergide shaded lens. It conveys the lost and failed ideals of the 60s and ties it to the failure to the drug culture. Depp and Del Torro stumble around Las Vegas in a drug induced haze ruining everything they come into contact with, it's humorous to watch. It doesn't hammer you over the head with the point that drugs destroy. Other films like Requiem for a Dream or Spun beat you senseless with the negatives. Fear and Loathing does this in a way that's fun to watch, but still gets to the point or lack thereof. Peace and love in shape of a blot of acid is a lie and a fallacy. But in this same light the film also manages to show the other side. The capitalistic insanity of the modern world and how convoluted things have gotten in our current world. It asks the viewer if reality is so much better than the alternative in the same breath that it chastises drug users and their antics. Is our society any better than the chaos propelled by drug use and it's users? It paints both sides with black humour and it's fantastic to watch and take in. Simply put, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a story about the drug culture and it's failings, but it's also social commentary on our actual culture and it's failings. I don't pretend to have a solution to the problems posed by both sides and neither does the film. And that's what makes it so good, it points things out but doesn't tell you the answer (much like the LSD).Regardless it's a fantastic watch and I think anyone who is delving into psychological drug use should watch it as well as anyone interested in cinema.

Well, if the Madie from 87-90 was my first crush, actually the star is Rosanna. I just like the way she is always away, dreamy, longing for something outside her grasp (By the way, I'm sure John Scott Campbell, the comic books artist, is also a fan because he always draws her).Here, Rosanna goes from middle-class desperate housewife to free punk runaway in the Lower East Side. It isn't the NYC of see sights books but it worth the look. We even go to the Dancetaria, the club where Madonna begins her career. Jesus, it's true, she is everywhere and I can't help writing about her.Well, i will add that this movie was an UFO in Hollywood at this time produced by a woman, written by and for another, directed by another one as well, i am sure that this feminine touch explains it success. Surely, nowadays, we need this badly!
