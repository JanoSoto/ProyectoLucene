A friend of mine asked how I can consider myself a movie reviewer, when I haven't even seen the film that is widely considered to be the best of all-time. He had a point, so I decided to rent it and my verdict is it. While the Godfather is a tremendous epic drama, I really don't see how it is considered to be the best film ever made. It's a great story, with a superstar cast, which set the genre for all the mafia films that followed, but that in and of itself means the film is going to have problems. As with other mafia films, it's difficult to keep track of who's who in the large cast. It also moves rather quickly and viewers like myself are going to have a very difficult time of trying to follow the erratic timeline of the film. Some parts move at a snails pace, while other just fly by, and what is with the music? The soundtrack is almost as acclaimed as the film, but honestly if I had to hear that song one more time, during this three hour epic, I may have gone out and killed someone myself. For those unfamiliar with the story, it follows the evolution of the Corleone family, as they transition from one leader to the next. The story is fantastic and is the furthest thing from predictable that you will ever find. It is filed with classic scenes and renowned performance from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, but I really have a hard time calling such a complicated story with that much violence, the best of all-time. The Godfather is a terrific movie, and I'm glad that I finally got to see it, but in a word, the film is overrated.

Had it been made in the error of CGI, this film would have been so much better. The story is strong, a lot stronger than the performances, and the use of some crazy special effects would have taken it over the top, but those weren't available in 1994. The result is a slightly above average film, with a really cool plot, and not much else. The story follows Max Walker (Jean-Claude Van Damme) whose job is to stop people from using illegal time travel technology, in order to change the past. Changing the past can drastically change the present, and is often abused by criminals trying to get wealth and power. One of those men is U.S. Senator McComb (Ron Silver), who has his eye on the Presidency. Walker must go back in time to stop McComb and expose him, before he can reshape the country in his own image. I love time oriented Science Fiction, as the story can take you on a magical trip all throughout history, like nothing else can. In this film, they didn't travel as much as they should have, and the technology and effects behind time travel were so basic, that it's hard to buy that this could ever work. Jean-Claude Van Damme stars and we all know that I see him as one of these brawn over brains guys, that only get work because of their looks and their fancy movies. Van Damme wasn't bad, but this is a film that had real potential, and simply using an average star, contributes to the overall sentiment of the film. Timecop is a great story, and in my opinion is something that could really work if it is re-made properly. It's not because the film is bad, it's just not a good as it should have been.

In 1946, producer David O. Selznick had the on-paper great idea to make a quasi-sequel to his big hit Gone with the Wind, another sprawling Western with intrigue, love, and gorgeous vistas and women. So he set out to make what would become Duel in the Sun, about an orphaned half-breed (the film's words), who is left in the care of her father's long-ago love on a giant cattle ranch in Texas in the 1800s. She's immediately drawn to each of the sons of the cattle baron who rules the land (Lionel Barrymore) &#x96; the intelligent, kind Jesse (Joseph Cotten) and his brawling, sneering brother Lewt (Gregory Peck). Danger surely will follow.It was a movie that effectively ended Selznick's career as a producer, as the unheard-of budget of $2 million ballooned to $8 million, and even though there were Oscar nominations, the movie didn't fare too well at the box office, with most of the gross coming from rentals later in the century. Selznick was a known micromanager, going through as many as seven (!) directors for the film, including himself, before King Vidor stepped in and somehow made it work. Sort of.Aside from the main plot of poor Pearl Chavez (Jennifer Jones, who later married Selznick, no coincidence there) and her loves and her (naturally) Spanish passion, there is a subplot about how the US government is trying to build its railroad across the country, but Senator McCanles (Barrymore) will be doggoned if he'll let them there Yankees run through his huge, huge, huge holdings.One look at the posters and other artwork for this movie and you'd think you were in for a romance film, something based on a Harlequin book.

And maybe you'd think that with such a great cast (including Lillian Gish, Herbert Marshall, Walter Huston, and Butterfly McQueen) and such a beautiful setting, it might be worthwhile. After all, duel is right there in the title, so surely there's action. Oh, boy.There's hardly any. Almost every scene in which Jones appears ends with her storming off or crying out in desperation, hand held to forehead. Her character isn't shown as a strong role model, she's shown as fiesty, which is code for not knowing her place as a plaything; Pearl is played with by Lewt, for the most part, so naturally she's fond of him. Aren't most women in favor of the bad boy? Ahead of its time, Duel in the Sun talks quite a bit about sex without really mentioning it.Aside from the morally debatable issues with Pearl's character as a woman, there's the relentless racism. Every pejorative you can think of for Native American is tossed out there and then laughed off. That's in addition to the stereotyping of Mexicans as people who just can't control their temper. It doesn't take long for it to get old and a little sickening. Pearl's not permitted to be her own person, just one who's owned.To top it off, this almost could have worked were it not for Jones' performance (although Oscar nominated). She vamps it up in the campiest way possible; perhaps she thought she was doing a soap-opera stint. Her acting is laughable nearly the entire way through. Cotten makes a terrific good guy, and Peck is commanding as the amoral, takes-what-he-wants Lewt. Lionel Barrymore, of course, plays the senator just like he would play mean Mr. Potter in It's a Wonderful Life, which is to say much like he played many of his one-dimensional characters. Gish is a sweet delight as always.Oh, and the duel? Yes, it happens, and yes it happens in the sun &#x96; on the side of a mountain, no less, but perhaps not between the two people you'd expect. Still, every moment of the so-called duel is excruciating to watch; you want them to hurry up and get on with it already. How long can high noon last?

There is so much to like about McCabe and Mrs Miller Warren Beatty is superb as the blow-hard, big shot - who has trouble adding in his head - has next to no business sense - but is smart enough to take Julie Christie (Mrs Miller) as a partner in the brothel business. Not a great fan of Mr. Beatty (Is Carly Simon's famous song about him? I think so), he is great in this role - showing that bluster and chutzpa can get you somewhere - although in the end of course it gets him killed.Julie Christie is beautiful, fiery, and mysterious as Mrs Miller. An opium addict, she tries to escape her quite sordid world through drugs ( sound familiar?) as she prods and cajoles McCabe to be what he pretends to be. One of my favorite scenes is when she is challenging him to think big - you always think small. This is interesting as he always talks big, but in fact has a very limited vision of what can be.I love to see growth (both good an bad) in characters. Check out the progression of evil in Walter White in Breaking Bad. McCabe, although he is 90% bluff (he is a gambler) does rise to the occasion when threatened by the gunslingers at the end. It is great to see him step up when the time came - even thought the end is tragic and very poignant.But the best part of the movie for me is the ambiance and setting and the cinematography. The bleak scenery and town provide a perfect backdrop for what I believe life was like in the early days of Western expansion. Mud, cold, unwashed people, ugly women, uglier men - this is what I imagine life was like in the Old West. Loving snow scenes, the weather portrayed in the movie is excellent, especially the heavy snow at the end. The way the film was shot with the haunting Leonard Cohen music gives this film an atmosphere of dark intrigue.BTW Leonard Cohen is still at it - check him out on one of the tracks in Sons of Anarchy (Come Healing).Finally there is the mystery. Is Warren Beatty actually John McCabe - the gunslinger who killed Bill Roundtree? Or is that part of the disguise he is willing to assume to gain respect? You can point out to events in the movie which support either theory. I'm interested in your take on this - let me know what you think. Hopefully I have motivated you to see this classic film.

Little did I know I would get scarred for life at 8 years old, and would have nightmares with the movie the same night as I watched it. I have to thank this moment, as it scarred me it also fascinated me, since nothing after that touched me so deep in an unconscious level, and that made me watch the movie a thousand times during my life.The movie is unanimously regarded as an orgasmic visual and aural experience, and I agree with it. But it's also questioned a lot by it's confusing story and unexplained ending. What I have to say is that the film is a tragic story about how power, when wasted and misused, means nothing, and how qualities like friendship and loyalty, as forgotten as they may be inside the human spirit, will survive after all the hate, anger and madness have done it's job.It's the soundtrack the true highlight of the movie - the tribal, powerful drums and dreamlike bells, all make it sound like there's something out of the physical realm orchestrating the inevitable fate of the characters. After so many years and so many times watching the movie I realized it was the soundtrack that traumatized me, as the genius combination of it with some of the imagery can give a profound impact even on an adult viewer... On a poor innocent 8 years old who only expected an action cartoon where the red jacket hero with the big laser gun would save the city, it's an impact he'd never forget. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 June 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I still remember how was the first time I got to see the movie saw how cool Kaneda looked on the VHS cover in a film rental store and asked for my aunt to rent it.

It's not any kind of terrible movie - you gotta love the tricks that Maurice gets Brian to play on other kids - but the movie misses the mark.

His aim is to become a hustler and take advantage of some of the rich women that frequent the area. Joe naively thinks that if he arrives in New York dressed as a cowboy that he will be able to hustle money out of these rich women. Whilst women do seem to like Joe, he doesn't really have the brains to be a successful hustler. Then Joe bumps into Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) - a lowlife street hustler who Joe initially takes a disliking to due to the fact that Ratso cons money out of Joe. However, when the two men realise that they both share a common goal of hustling for money, the two men set to work hustling as many people as possible with mixed results.....Midnight Cowboy is a truly wonderful film which is a human drama with a real emotional core. The main strength of this film lies with the strong performances from Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. Voight is perfect as the unintelligent red neck wannabe cowboy from out of town. His southern accent does make him sound unintelligent, but Voight's facial expressions and mannerisms help to create this effect. I've always felt that a convincing accent and sharp dialogue can only carry a film so far - sometimes you need the actor to bring that little bit extra to the table and I feel that Voight was excellent in this respect. Hoffman is also good - his character generally has a meaner edge to him, but he lives in squalor in probably one of the worst apartment in New York. His character has a limp and a cough which will more than likely make the viewer pity him rather than like him. The film flows well and I felt it was told at an even pace, the journey that the two men make was funny, heartbreaking, interesting, moving and on the odd occasion disturbing, but all this is done in a way that is both interesting and engaging.One other aspect that particularly impressed me were the photography and visuals; the editing and photography were fantastic - the part where Joe is chasing Ratso and the dream sequences were top notch. We tend to see this sort of thing more and more these days, but back in 1969 this would undoubtedly have been something that was rather novel. The music in this film is also terrific and includes the wonderful 'Everybody's talking at me'. Midnight Cowboy is an excellent film which is both touching and funny in equal measures. Ratso and Joe at times will bicker together, laugh together, and suffer together, but it's a journey you'll be glad you took time to make with them. Right from the moment Joe sets off to New York to the rather moving end, this is a rewarding and enjoyable experience. If you haven't seen Midnight Cowboy then I strongly suggest you watch it as it is an excellent film both visually and emotionally.
