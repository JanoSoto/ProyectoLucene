[{"date":"9 December 2014","score":"","review":" Snow Day isn't perfect, but I saw it in grade seven and loved it immediately. Sure it's got the one or two crude humor jokes and sure it's hokey at times, but it's a hilarious adventure about what can happen on a snow day.Hal and Natalie are a brother and sister living in Syracuse with their weatherman father, stay-at-home computer addicted mom and baby brother Randy. The family is dysfunctional; Laura (the mom) is always on her webcam and never looks away from the screen, then gets angry when Randy makes a mess or wants to play with her. Tom (the father) has very low ratings and is constantly in competition with Chad Symmonz, a flashy modern weatherman who viewers all over town love. Randy is a defiant child always getting into things and making messes just for the hell of it. Hal has a fixation on a popular girl from his high school, Claire.Meanwhile, Natalie and her two friends (an overweight boy named Wayne and her best friend Chet) are mad that it's winter and Syracuse is in the middle of a heatwave, meaning there won't be any snow days, much to the joy of their school principal. Natalie wishes on her brother's favorite action figures for a snow day to come by...When Natalie gets her wish, the town suddenly changes. Anything can happen on a snow day, Natalie says, and it can. Laura is about to learn that a family matters more than a laptop screen, Tom is about to find the courage to stand up to Chad Symmonz. Hal is going to discover that his real true love has been right by his side the whole time and Natalie and her friends will finally have the courage to stand up to the evil Snowplowman, the sadistic and somewhat pervy guy who always foils her plans of a perfect day off of school.I had the movie novelization of Snow Day as a kid (I bought it at a second-hand store when I was three). I've gotta say, the movie is much better, I love the animation in the intro, and there are various funny scenes, from Tom knocking over an ice sculpture of Chad to a janitor finding the words Al Martino bites the big one written above a toilet at his skating rink (he dips the cleaning rag in the toilet to get it wet as he cleans away the graffiti). The only thing I just didn't understand was Wayne (the fat kid). Every time he runs, a farting noise plays in the background, it's unnecessary and pretty crude.

Lester was a young boy with our very own favorite memory (lying on the grass looking at clouds). He fell in love with Carolyn when she still had joy in her. But he got a job he hated to support a family inside a box with a white picket cage around it, a world where you can make money to buy stuff you don't need but you can't buy stuff to make you feel alive because it is not sensible (the red Firebird). Gender relations had turned upside down his wife dominated him to where Less-stir stirred less. He literally sat in the back seat. Family broke apart his daughter wished her parents could get a life of their own. Computers proliferated profits, losses, and suckers ran glowingly across Lester's face for 17 years. His boss was not a leader or a mentor his boss was a Brad. With human leadership assassinated, corporate tentacles extended everywhere. Homosexuality became open&#x97;to some&#x97;scary, to others. Drugs earned a secure place in the culture Lester gave up drugs maybe too soon and now the kids were into them, making it convenient to have a peddler next door. That's the setup.Lester's libido got tickled by an inappropriate target a young girl. He spoke back to his wife who mocked him in bed. That made him smile. He smoked with a young boy who was falling in love with his own daughter. He pounded a brad back into Brad when Brad asked him to write his own death warrant in a corporate reorganization. He quit he quit to get alive for at least a moment before he was to die. He started working out. This was tragically mis-read by the guy next door. It's Col. Fitz who is the tragic one, not Lester. Lester dies with a smile on his face after he realizes he feels great, that his daughter loves a sweet boy, that he doesn't care who is wife is f----ing. He becomes a father to the girl after whom he lusted he wraps her in a protective blanket to set her free. He lets her be who she really is rather than who she thought she was supposed to be. They both grow up.It's not a spoiler to say here that Lester dies that's the first thing he tells us. You can't really die until you are alive&#x97;so the rest of the movie raises Lester from the deadened life he'd been trained to live. He&#x97;and hence we&#x97;look at life from above. We learn to smile with him particularly when he delivers the sack of burgers. We see the perfect life is antiseptic white with vased slashes of reds, the way Carolyn would have it, or reds could fall like snow, the way fantasy has it, or the reds could be messy, messy, the way life has 'em. Life messes up organization if we try to force ourselves into the back seat.
