It was described as a rock opera, and was indeed the first album to be so described, because the songs told a story, which was explained on the album's sleeve notes. It was not originally intended to be performed on stage in the same way as a Classical opera, but someone clearly thought that the story had dramatic potential, because it was turned into this film and later into a Broadway play. The title character is a young man who becomes deaf, dumb, and blind following a traumatic childhood experience, then later becomes a champion pinball player and is hailed as the Messiah of a new religion. I must admit that I am not a great fan of The Who's music; my main reason for watching the film was that it was directed by Ken Russell, one of the leading British auteur directors of the sixties and seventies. Not every film made by Russell was a masterpiece- some of them were far from being so- but he was generally interesting (as well as controversial), and he brought to Tommy his the vivid visual imagination which was a hallmark of his films. Early in his career, as in his famous Elgar documentary and even in something like Billion Dollar Brain, Russell was capable of restraint and good taste, but by the mid-seventies he had developed a visual style characterised by bright colours and a fast-moving kaleidoscope of striking, sometimes shocking, images. The film is perhaps most notable for Russell's visuals; scenes which stand out include the Prologue, which tells the story of Tommy's parents, Group Captain Walker and his wife Nora, the Acid Queen sequence with Tina Turner, the bizarre scene involving a religious cult that worships Marilyn Monroe and the Pinball Wizard sequence in which the film's best-known musical number is belted out by a manic Elton John; the cast list names John's character as the pinball wizard, although the lyrics of the song make it clear that this description refers to Tommy himself. (Practising Catholics might have been offended by the Marilyn scene, which parodies the Mass, although it should be pointed out that Russell himself was a Catholic). Russell also had a good eye for the eccentricities and inanities of British popular culture in the sixties and seventies, something shown in the holiday camp scenes, the Christmas party and the various advertisement parodies. The Who's lead singer Roger Daltrey plays the title role, and the other band members all make appearances, along with other rock stars such as John, Turner and Eric Clapton. The film is a sung through musical, without spoken dialogue, so it is surprising that Oliver Reed and Jack Nicholson, neither of whom were noted for their singing voice, were cast, Reed in the major role of Tommy's stepfather. The best acting performance comes from Ann-Margret as the sluttish Nora, a performance which won her a Golden Globe Award and an Oscar nomination. (Ann-Margret is only three years older than Daltrey, who plays her son, but in a heavily stylised, non-naturalistic film this does not really matter). My main problem with the film is that this type of rock music is not really the ideal vehicle for putting across a story dramatically, particularly a tragic story like Tommy's. (Besides being struck dumb, deaf and blind, Tommy also loses his father at an early age, is tortured by a sadistic cousin, sexually abused by a perverted uncle, and suffers problems with drug addiction. Even his role as the new Messiah fails to bring him satisfaction or happiness). The music, generally loud with an insistent rhythmic beat, designed to be exciting or exhilarating, lacks the variety to cope with the vast range of different emotions which would be involved in a story like this one. The film does manage to tell a story- one can always work out what is going on from the visuals alone, even if the lyrics are unclear or inaudible- but it does so without any subtlety, insight, sympathy or understanding. (The scenes in which Tommy is abused, making light of a serious matter, struck me as particularly crass).The traditional Broadway-style musical, and for that matter the traditional Classical opera, are much more effective narrative vehicles in this respect. As I said, The Who are not really my cup of tea, musically speaking, and those who love their music may well enjoy the film more than I did, although I note that there are several negative comments on here from those who describe themselves as Who fans. The visuals are striking, if occasionally garish or in dubious taste, but it is difficult to make a successful film on the basis of visuals alone. Tommy betrays its origins as a rock album, resembling nothing so much as a series of loosely-connected pop videos. Nice videos, shame about the film. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 April 2013","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Tommy started life in 1969 as an album by The Who.

The title character is a young man who becomes deaf, dumb, and blind following a traumatic childhood experience, then later becomes a champion pinball player and is hailed as the Messiah of a new religion. I must admit that I am not a great fan of The Who's music; my main reason for watching the film was that it was directed by Ken Russell, one of the leading British auteur directors of the sixties and seventies. Not every film made by Russell was a masterpiece- some of them were far from being so- but he was generally interesting (as well as controversial), and he brought to Tommy his the vivid visual imagination which was a hallmark of his films. Early in his career, as in his famous Elgar documentary and even in something like Billion Dollar Brain, Russell was capable of restraint and good taste, but by the mid-seventies he had developed a visual style characterised by bright colours and a fast-moving kaleidoscope of striking, sometimes shocking, images. The film is perhaps most notable for Russell's visuals; scenes which stand out include the Prologue, which tells the story of Tommy's parents, Group Captain Walker and his wife Nora, the Acid Queen sequence with Tina Turner, the bizarre scene involving a religious cult that worships Marilyn Monroe and the Pinball Wizard sequence in which the film's best-known musical number is belted out by a manic Elton John; the cast list names John's character as the pinball wizard, although the lyrics of the song make it clear that this description refers to Tommy himself. (Practising Catholics might have been offended by the Marilyn scene, which parodies the Mass, although it should be pointed out that Russell himself was a Catholic). Russell also had a good eye for the eccentricities and inanities of British popular culture in the sixties and seventies, something shown in the holiday camp scenes, the Christmas party and the various advertisement parodies. The Who's lead singer Roger Daltrey plays the title role, and the other band members all make appearances, along with other rock stars such as John, Turner and Eric Clapton. The film is a sung through musical, without spoken dialogue, so it is surprising that Oliver Reed and Jack Nicholson, neither of whom were noted for their singing voice, were cast, Reed in the major role of Tommy's stepfather. The best acting performance comes from Ann-Margret as the sluttish Nora, a performance which won her a Golden Globe Award and an Oscar nomination. (Ann-Margret is only three years older than Daltrey, who plays her son, but in a heavily stylised, non-naturalistic film this does not really matter). My main problem with the film is that this type of rock music is not really the ideal vehicle for putting across a story dramatically, particularly a tragic story like Tommy's. (Besides being struck dumb, deaf and blind, Tommy also loses his father at an early age, is tortured by a sadistic cousin, sexually abused by a perverted uncle, and suffers problems with drug addiction. Even his role as the new Messiah fails to bring him satisfaction or happiness). The music, generally loud with an insistent rhythmic beat, designed to be exciting or exhilarating, lacks the variety to cope with the vast range of different emotions which would be involved in a story like this one. The film does manage to tell a story- one can always work out what is going on from the visuals alone, even if the lyrics are unclear or inaudible- but it does so without any subtlety, insight, sympathy or understanding. (The scenes in which Tommy is abused, making light of a serious matter, struck me as particularly crass).The traditional Broadway-style musical, and for that matter the traditional Classical opera, are much more effective narrative vehicles in this respect. As I said, The Who are not really my cup of tea, musically speaking, and those who love their music may well enjoy the film more than I did, although I note that there are several negative comments on here from those who describe themselves as Who fans. The visuals are striking, if occasionally garish or in dubious taste, but it is difficult to make a successful film on the basis of visuals alone. Tommy betrays its origins as a rock album, resembling nothing so much as a series of loosely-connected pop videos. Nice videos, shame about the film. 5\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Musical"},{"date":"19 April 2013","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Tommy started life in 1969 as an album by The Who.

To place the viewer in a murky house, alongside some character unfortunates, and then scare the tar out of them has always been the aim. It hasn't often worked to great effect, in fact the number of genuine scary haunted house movies barely trouble the fingers of both hands. How strange, then, that the best of the bunch chose a simple formula that has never been replicated since with the same great effect.The Haunting thrives not on what it throws at you by way of jumps and peek-a-boo visceral shocks, it deals firmly in the realm of what you can't see scares you the most. Where we have to use our own fretful imaginations to fill in the blanks for us, which is never a good thing in psychological horror parlance. Robert Wise, a most gifted and versatile director, uses oblique camera angles, thundering sound effects and angled close ups of his actors to get the maximum amount of atmosphere from the premise.Distortion is very much a key component here.

While the house itself (exterior is Ettington Park Hotel in Stratford-Upon-Avon) is an ominous character all of its own.

In my opinion, this film is a crime classic, and I cannot believe 2 Days In The Valley (TDINV) is not better known. If you look at the cast you will understand why. It starts with Lee Woods (James Spader), a super cool robotic hit man, and his partner Helga Svelgen (Charlize Theron), who is an ice cold evil blonde. They are hired to kill the husband of Becky Foxx (Teri Hatcher), so she can be on the US Olympic Team. They are promised $30,000 which is in the house to do so. Assisting them is hit man Dosmo Pizzo (Danny Aiello), who turns against them, when they set him up to be the fall guy. Spoilers ahead Helga, gets killed by Becky after a nasty cat fight (She had it coming to her). Meanwhile, Dosmo ends up meeting Susan (Glenn Headley), who is constantly abused by her snobbish boss Allen Hopper (Greg Cruttwell), and treated worse than his dog. In my favorite scene, Dosmo discovers Susan is Italian (Something in six years, Greg never learned about her because he took no interest in her as a human being), and he cooks a meal (As he is holding them hostage), and has her sit at the table with him, while he eats on the floor with his dog. Other key characters are washed screenwriter Teddy Peppers (Paul Mazursky) who wanted to commit suicide after he found someone to take care of his dog, Nurse Audrey (Marsha Mason), and Detectives Strayer (Jeff Daniels) and Taylor (Eric Stolz).Spoilers In the end, Lee ends up shooting Taylor, and Dosmo tries to rescue him, but cannot defeat Lee, and both will be killed, except Teddy shoots Lee dead. That action, enables him to get his confidence back and be able to start over with Audrey (Marsha Mason). One other point, about Peppers, you see in the final scene with Audrey, that he is very different than before, and will not only get a reward from the City for saving Taylor, but since he is in screenwriter, he can tell a story (leaving Dosmo & Susan out of course), that could get him a huge advance. Think about it A Hollywood writer saves a cop, Warner Bros, Paramount, Universal and all the rest would bid on that. I would figure, that should be worth six figures to him. Dosmo and Susan end up with the $30,000 and will go to New York to open a pizza shop (Taylor lets him have it, because he was willing to take a bullet for him (Essentially the hit man turns good guy because of his conscious)). A key theme of the film is second chances for people who were essentially washed up Dosmo, Susan, Teddy, Taylor (He would have been dead except for Dosmo & Teddy), Becky (Who gets away with it), and last, but not least, Strayer who is abusive cop, who almost shoots a black guy (Due to his temper) and wants to commit suicide, but because of thinking about his daughter does not (He gets a letter telling him to turn in his Badge, for psychological reasons, but although unhappy, at least he tolerates it, and has a chance to get his act cleaned up (Based on the theme of the film, he does).

Brando almost seemed to be a caricature of himself in the early scenes&#x85; although he got a little better, a little less heavy-handed, after the Don came home from the hospital. In that first sequence in his office during the wedding, I could hardly understand a word he was saying. How could anyone take a man who spoke that way seriously? But again, I was watching it after many years of encountering deliberately bad Brando imitations, so I was at a disadvantage in that respect.That wedding&#x85; good lord, it lasted longer than many marriages do! I thought it was never going to be over. But while I was watching it, I recalled that I had in fact tried to watch this movie about 30 years ago, when my brother was really into it.

The plant, voiced by Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops, certainly makes a strong case to his nebbish tender that there are plenty of bad people you can 86 real quiet-like and get me some lunch!The humor of Howard Ashman and Alan Mencken's energetic, Brill-quoting score is well-abetted by a star turn by Rick Moranis as hapless plant- store lackey Seymour Krelborn and Steve Martin and Bill Murray in brilliant supporting turns.Martin's cruel character, he's a dentist and he'll never ever be any good, gets off on the pain he inflicts so hilariously, with the best song in the movie, Dentist! and some quality time with Murray as a masochistic patient, that he hurts the film's final third by his necessary if disappointing absence. By then, the film has run out of laughs, even if it still delivers some nice music (Suddenly Seymour, the other great song) and the master puppetry of Audrey II. Little Shop is never not entertaining, but it doesn't really benefit from the big-budget treatment so much as allowing itself to be overwhelmed by it.I don't even mind the controversial Hollywood ending. I haven't seen the ending director Frank Oz originally shot, but it seems unlikely Little Shop would be the enduring hit it is with sadder fates played out for the two leads, played so sympathetically by Moranis and Ellen Greene you really root for them. I suspect cynical Manhattan theater-goers would have loved a gory finale, but I can see moviegoers in general being turned off as they were in test screenings. Still, this different ending has its own issues; mainly from being kind of rushed and tentative in its tone, its comedy reduced to more forced laughs at the stereotypical conventions of mid-20th century American life.Little Shop works best as a straight genre send-up, with sketch work courtesy of its many SCTV and Saturday Night Live vets. Even so, John Candy's bit as a DJ is lame padding, as are some of the musical numbers, like the dire Skid Row (Downtown). Oz's ability to work with puppets does wonders for selling Audrey II's menace, and his visual cleverness is, as always, a delight for the eyes. Having three girl singers come in and out of the story does a lot to keep the energy up; I enjoy their bits even when they don't always make sense.For me, Little Shop will always be a great cable-TV discovery, something you could watch for a random ten minutes here or there, be entertained, and then move on with your life. The film doesn't run out of gas so much as suffer a bit from its irony overload, a need to showcase its cleverness at every turn. It is clever, very clever at times, but lacks for real heart.Still, this is a movie everyone should see at least once, especially if they love cheapo sci-fi horror movies and early-'60s ambiance. Little Shop has a lot going for it, even if its parts don't add up to a riveting sum.

I suspect cynical Manhattan theater-goers would have loved a gory finale, but I can see moviegoers in general being turned off as they were in test screenings. Still, this different ending has its own issues; mainly from being kind of rushed and tentative in its tone, its comedy reduced to more forced laughs at the stereotypical conventions of mid-20th century American life.Little Shop works best as a straight genre send-up, with sketch work courtesy of its many SCTV and Saturday Night Live vets. Even so, John Candy's bit as a DJ is lame padding, as are some of the musical numbers, like the dire Skid Row (Downtown). Oz's ability to work with puppets does wonders for selling Audrey II's menace, and his visual cleverness is, as always, a delight for the eyes. Having three girl singers come in and out of the story does a lot to keep the energy up; I enjoy their bits even when they don't always make sense.For me, Little Shop will always be a great cable-TV discovery, something you could watch for a random ten minutes here or there, be entertained, and then move on with your life. The film doesn't run out of gas so much as suffer a bit from its irony overload, a need to showcase its cleverness at every turn. It is clever, very clever at times, but lacks for real heart.Still, this is a movie everyone should see at least once, especially if they love cheapo sci-fi horror movies and early-'60s ambiance. Little Shop has a lot going for it, even if its parts don't add up to a riveting sum.

The plant, voiced by Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops, certainly makes a strong case to his nebbish tender that there are plenty of bad people you can 86 real quiet-like and get me some lunch!The humor of Howard Ashman and Alan Mencken's energetic, Brill-quoting score is well-abetted by a star turn by Rick Moranis as hapless plant- store lackey Seymour Krelborn and Steve Martin and Bill Murray in brilliant supporting turns.Martin's cruel character, he's a dentist and he'll never ever be any good, gets off on the pain he inflicts so hilariously, with the best song in the movie, Dentist! and some quality time with Murray as a masochistic patient, that he hurts the film's final third by his necessary if disappointing absence. By then, the film has run out of laughs, even if it still delivers some nice music (Suddenly Seymour, the other great song) and the master puppetry of Audrey II.

So much so, you forget there's a vicious serial killer about until the underwhelming revelation. After figuring out the pattern behind the crimes all we get is; He's a nobody. Still being the case, it's the quirky lead performance of Kevin Kline's beatnik character that drives this one home and along with director Pat O'Connor's able handling. Personal dramas and friction lead the way, which are actually a lot more interesting than the slowly pitched out investigative angle of John Patrick Shanley's jarringly unsure screenplay where Kline's disgraced ex-cop character is hesitantly asked (by his police commissioner brother played with stern mentality by Harvey Kietel) to rejoin the police fore to help track down a serial killer that for every month has been killing a women for 11 months. The concept had some promise even if the nature of it can be routine, but whenever it tackles Kline's character looking into the pattern of this serial killer, trying his best to work him out and beat the clock before the next murder. It suddenly takes a sidestep into uncharted area, involving his brother and his wife (who was his ex-girlfriend which Susan Sarandon gives a icy turn), the reason why he was originally sacked from the police force is shady and why would they get rid of someone who they think is smart and believe can get the job done. The script only seems to open up more questions then what it started off with and some occurrences are somewhat convenient to the story's progression, but it remains engrossingly witty with a certain edge about it. Then there's the romance with witness \/ mayor's daughter by the delightful Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. However there are some memorable moments, especially consisting of Rod Steiger's scolding performance as the Mayor and Danny Aiello's hot- headed police Captain. Also showing their faces are Faye Grant, Kenneth Walsh, Bill Cobbs and an amusingly dry Alan Rickman as Kline's neighbour \/ artist friend. The assortment of this cast really builds up a perfect chemistry to watch. Hate this job.
