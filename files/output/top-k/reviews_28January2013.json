Hogarth manages to hide the giant in the local scrap yard, which is run by Dean McCoppin; a friendly beatnik who uses the scrap to make his 'art'. Eventually it emerges that while the robot is friendly it has formidable defensive capabilities that could make it extremely dangerous if attacked... which is just what happens when Mansley gets the army in.This film is a real delight; it has a slightly retro look and nicely captures the Cold War paranoia and childhood innocence. The animation looked great; the characters didn't look 'cartoony' and the scenery looked great. The story is a solid sci-fi drama that, while aimed at children, can be enjoyed by older viewers. The voice actors, who include some big names, do a fine job bringing the characters to life. The story itself had plenty of exciting moments as well as a few laughs. There are also a few poignant moments that deal with death and may cause a tear or two to be shed... and not just by younger viewers!

The Holocaust was anything but funny then and now as thousands of Europeans of Jewish faith were killed off mainly towards fear, paranoia, economical insecurity and just plain hatred. But once in a while towards sadness, we can open our hearts and try to survive the grimness with some humour to raise our spirit. And that is exactly what actor\/director\/writer Roberto Benigni succeeds in Life is Beautiful. It's a refreshing break from the graphic and and disturbing images that has haunted the theatres past and present like Spielberg's Schildler's List or Polanski's The Pianist as we look to a more brighter side of the Holocaust mainly toward the humour of the leading protagonist, Guido Orefice (Benigni).When it first came out and it was listed as a comedy, I thought it was just too surreal to be true. I mean nothing funny ever happened in the Holocaust. And film adaptations have been quite demonstrative at that. In those troubled times, lives were lost, families were separated, people were cold, starving fear and doubt was on the minds of Europeans Jewish and non-Jewish. at the time. But Benigni showed his mastery in front and behind the camera that we can enjoy the goodness of life, even in times of uncertainty because we only live once and we must enjoy it while we can.Benigni was not the only person who made this film all the more worthwhile. Nicoletta Braschi turns in a wonderful performance as a Catholic girl who loves her husband regardless of what religion he practises. A grand portion of scenes demonstrates just how pointless racism is and the best example is set in the schoolroom scene.Concentration camps are one of the worst establishments anyone would ever dream of entering and yet in this movie we can enjoy a chuckle. In one scene, Guido persuades the soldiers as he defends his son as a ploy to prevent his son from further dire circumstances. While we laugh as he tries to weasel his way out from further punishment, we are still aware and concerned about the welfare of Guido and his young son and the dangers they are encountering.The fearful and depressing effects of the Holocaust is exhibited in brief moments of sad truths that weave into Guido's detailed fantasies. But you never see him fall victim to disparity. His wild imagination and his determination are the only weapons of protection he utilizes to keep his family and his son in tact. The remarkable story of love and tenderness is worthy enough for everyone to see. This movie should be cherished for a long time to come.

HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION is surely one of the dumbest, unnecessary, most hackneyed attempts to continue a franchise past its expiration date, EVER. The most offensive things occur right at the beginning. At the end of H20 we finally saw Michael Myers killed once and for all when Jamie Lee Curtis chopped off his head with an axe, right? Wrong. Because now an absurd plot device was created where we learn via flashback that prior to the decapitation, Michael supposedly got hold of a paramedic, crushed his larynx so he couldn't speak, and dressed him up in his own clothes and mask; thus, it was actually the paramedic and not Myers who lost his head (!). There is a certain creativity to such an idea, but it's also a cheap way with which to completely obliterate the last movie and try to keep the cash cow milked.The next part really puzzles me. The real Michael Myers arrives at a sanitarium where sister Jamie Lee now resides and he kills her within the first fifteen minutes. That's right - KILLS HER. So all Laurie Strode's efforts from those other Halloween films come to an abrupt and uncaring end in one flash. Aside from the plot point, the main thing that really bothers me about this to this day is why did Jamie Lee Curtis agree to do it? She had gone on record four years prior saying that it was her idea to return for the last chapter (H20) and have the Laurie character get her revenge. It boggles my mind that Curtis would have bothered with this idiotic followup and get herself offed, after she had been the one who wanted to bring some dignity back to her character. If I ever meet her I'm definitely going to question her about this. Could the money have been THAT good??From here, Michael Myers has no family members left to kill. So a scenario is set up where an internet website is hosting a Reality Show for Halloween Night, staged in the very same old abandoned house that Myers grew up in as a child. They've got web cams and a live feed installed so that millions of viewers at home may get a thrill as rapper Busta Rhymes impersonates Michael to make it look good. At first it's just a gag, except when the real Myers heads back home again. You haven't lived until you've seen Busta kung-fu the masked Michael.I can't even write about this.

It's aged well, and is the opener for a massive TV series franchise. Basically, Dr Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is called into a military research station to decipher hieroglyphs and other symbols on a large artifact found at Giza in 1928, which is of course the first Stargate and was built by the alien civilisation that created the Ancient Egyptian way of life here on Earth, which have since gone on another planet, where our intrepid explorers go and find a similar civilisation to what the Egyptians might have been two thousand plus years ago on Earth. Their language is similar enough to what Dr Jackson, an archaeological linguist, can reasonably and not-improbably understand, after a few false starts.The film is of epic proportions set against sweeping sand dune vistas and huge sets, reminiscent of the big studio classics, with hundreds of extras who are real people not painted in later. It has an iconic soundtrack that is almost operatic in places, and the costumes, ancient Egyptian similarities and the special effects are just brilliant even nearly twenty years on, and without the prolific CGI we have today! It is visually very impressive, and original. The script isn't great and is really the only thing that lets the film down a point. It's all a bit rushed and staccato at the beginning - the bit on Earth is the least convincing actually. The film manages some humour as well as having you on the edge of your seat for a climactic finale, which is also a little emotive. James Spader is always a good bet, known most prominently for rather seedy, smutty, awkward or fast talking characters (Oh! How I love Boston Legal), he is superb as the academic PhD here; his calm, measured and quiet delivery are perfect against Kurt Russell's buzz-cut macho all-guns-blazing military man on a mission. Jaye Davidson gives a rather scary performance as Ra (the Sun god) with control and an almost sexual element and effeminacy but also a violence and temper that are only partially helped by special effects. I really loved the acting - possibly the stand out character - of Alexis Cruz as the smart and brave village boy Skaara who makes first contact and is the plucky comic relief! Erick Avari, the village leader Kasuf, is a familiar face now (but perhaps wasn't so much back in the early 90s as this was his first major film role) as is French Stewart, one of the soldiers (3rd Rock from the Sun) and also Djimon Hounsou in an early in his acting career small though perfectly formed role as Horus. A brilliant film, well worth watching for sci-fi, Egyptian, alien, anthropology, archaeology, action adventure interests. It is worth noting that the beginning of the film is in German with subtitles and your DVD language and subtitle options aren't playing up (I stupidly forgot that last time I watched as it had been such a long time since I'd seen it), and also there are subtitles for the plot-important Egyptian dialect conversations too.

Erick Avari, the village leader Kasuf, is a familiar face now (but perhaps wasn't so much back in the early 90s as this was his first major film role) as is French Stewart, one of the soldiers (3rd Rock from the Sun) and also Djimon Hounsou in an early in his acting career small though perfectly formed role as Horus. A brilliant film, well worth watching for sci-fi, Egyptian, alien, anthropology, archaeology, action adventure interests. It is worth noting that the beginning of the film is in German with subtitles and your DVD language and subtitle options aren't playing up (I stupidly forgot that last time I watched as it had been such a long time since I'd seen it), and also there are subtitles for the plot-important Egyptian dialect conversations too.

Set in 2019 Los Angeles, Blade Runner presents a bleak dystopian future. The very first thing you see after the opening credits are these giant smokestacks belching black clouds and fiery bursts into the air, then high rise buildings which dwarf anything that's been built today, with full picture\/video ads playing on the sides of the buildings, plus flying cars called spinners. This contrasts with the poverty and despair which you find below (shades of the old sci fi movie Metropolis). The main character is Rick Deckard, a blade runner, played by Harrison Ford. He's up against a group of rebel replicants led by Roy Battie (Rutger Hauer) who have come back to Earth. They want to be human like everyone else, and are willing to die (or kill) trying. There's another interesting twist to the story, which is hinted at more strongly in the director's cut than in the original Is Deckard himself a replicant?The concept was very good (taken from a story by Philip K.

The idea of humans killing and enslaving each other is not new; it's been going on throughout history.

I just didn't care that much about what happened to the characters in the story, and given the story and subject matter involved I SHOULD care..deeply. The mere fact that Ridley Scott re-cut this movie three times tells you all you need to know there. Unfortunately, re-cutting Blade Runner is like trying to give an ugly building a fresh coat of paint...it's still ugly. Ironically, what this movie has going for it in spades are the visuals of the futuristic Los Angeles; they're nothing short of stunning, and this was long before the advent of CGI.Blade Runner could have been great.

Braveheart is one of those rare exceptions that manages to both entertain me with good story and likable cast and great visual spectacle.Mel Gibson does a great job of both directing and playing the titular character. We have splendid cast featuring Brian Cox, Patrick McGoohan, Catherine McCormack, Michael Byrne and always splendid Brendan Gleeson. The battle scenes are bloody, gory and very painful. It's very brutal film and might detract some of the more sensitive people. Braveheart looks great and not cheap like some other films. I also liked the fact that this film was made before the CGI armies era. I like that they put an actual effort in making this film, not waste our time with boring crap like Alexander or *beeping* Troy.The overall story felt too simplistic and characters lacked depth. But it can be forgiven since they were aiming for more of entertaining spectacle not a David Lean epic. Also my general disinterest in the setting didn't help much.
