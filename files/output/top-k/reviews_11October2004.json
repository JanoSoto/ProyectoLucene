[{"date":"11 October 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  QuillsGeoffrey Rush is in peak form in this harrowing 2001 Philip Kaufman film about the Marquis de Sade, a man whose life is as frighteningly defiant as his writings.Confined in the infamous Charenton asylum, he continues to grunt out his lewd writing on blankets and sheets that Kate Winslet, a laundrywoman, smuggles out to a mythic Zorro-like figure in the gate. His literary pursuits detail graphic sex, incest, debauchery, blasphemy and other aberrations, among other things.The film illuminates the Marquis' act of writing rather than his life, which is actually one long sadistic bacchanalian adventure. The insane are highly stylized, full of verve, venom and innocence, but Mr. Kaufman's over-reaching enthusiasm deprives his work of the gorgeous sensuality that throbbed in 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being'. The voluptuous Ms. Winslet has that wild streak that redeems her from her ill-starred Titanic extravaganza, and Michael Caine as the evil villain and Marquis-torturer is the perfect husband for that mad nurse in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoos' Nest'.Beautiful shots, admirable blocking, seamless editing and hapless Jude Law's star turn in the end balance the barefaced caricatures and dramatic provocation. This film is one compelling viewing.
