[{"date":"25 October 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Rounders is considered the cinema spokesman for present day poker. In fact, it is more than that; it is a recruiting film for no limit hold 'em. It's the story of a talented poker player who gives up a promising career as a lawyer, his girl friend, his mentor, and all else just to play the game and is, in the end, successful at it and happy with it. How much more of a recruiting film can it be?The story line is simple and straight forward. There are no plot twists. I kept looking for a way for the story tellers to introduce a curve in the plot, but none came. The ending is predictable, right from the start. The film does not intend to do anything spectacular except to accurately show us what poker hustling is about today and it is generally successful in that effort. We don't mind the voice-over of our hero as he explains the various psychologies of the motivation, the rules and rewards of successful poker play.The lead is played by Matt Damon. He is matched scene by scene by Edward Norton, this time in a slightly overplayed role. Support is offered by Gretchen Mol as the maligned girl friend, by John Malkovich as a Russian mobster with a ridiculous accent, by Martin Landau as a revered judge with a bad toupee, by John Turturro as a caricature of me (at least I thought so), and by Famke Janssen as the cashier, all good performances.The opening scene takes place in an underground poker den in New York, run by the Russian mobster (John Malkovich). The main character, played by Matt Damon, risks all his money and most of his future in a poker confrontation with Malkovich. In the deciding hand, Malkovich slow plays aces which Damon mistakenly believes to be a drawing hand. Damon sets his trap and Malkovich draws out on it. The trap is typical and has been addressed in our discussions. On the turn, the board shows a pair of nines which makes Damon a full house. Damon sets the trap by checking the full house to Malkovich to give him a chance to make a flush. Malkovich checks along, with aces and nines. While Damon's trap is usually rewarding,it fails this time. The river brings an ace of spades. Damon believes Malkovich has made his flush, states that he doesn't believe Malkovich has made the flush, and Damon moves in. The ace, of course, has made Malkovich aces full and Damon loses everything.Anything wrong here? It's a heads up match and slow playing the aces is something that is easily done in heads up play, depending on the rhythm of the hands. We won't criticize the Malkovich character for that. When Malkovich checks along with Damon after the turn, he risks nearly nothing and has everything to gain. Damon, being an excellent player, should know the risk of checking the full house, but he's placed Malkovich on a spades draw and feels he's risking nothing. We don't know why he's so sure of the spades draw, but he plays with this conviction. After all, full houses are hard to come by and he has one. Later in the film, Damon says with candor, the hand was not a bad beat; instead, he was out played. And indeed he was.We know we're going to end up, at the end of the movie, in the Russian's poker den with another heads up match between the two adversaries. And we know Damon is going to win.Cue the final scene. There is irony in the decisive hand as Damon slow plays his flopped straight. He checks the hand all the way through and Malkovich does all his betting for him, including the all-in move. The trap that broke Damon in the early scene has been reversed, except this time it isn't a draw out which, somehow, makes it cleaner. After the hand, the Malkovich character complains how the Damon character 'checked and checked', which gives the winner even more satisfaction.Anything wrong? Sure. We don't believe Malkovich would take the lead in the final hand. Yes, it's a two gap straight and a little hard to spot but, in moving in, Malkovich risks all against the possible nuts. He has obviously put Damon on two pair and played it accordingly, making the same procedural error Damon made in the early hand. It's more probable that Malkovich would have checked along with Damon (after the turn would have been good) to see what he wanted to do after the next card. Although it isn't said, the message is this time Damon out played Malkovich.The movie is filled with jargon. The viewer will enjoy the film whether or not he understands the special words, but those who know the language enjoy it more.The sets are back room typical, although I don't think poker would be played on that many hard surfaces. They photograph better, though.Edward Norton plays the cheater, 'Worm'. Norton acts like many cheaters I've known, but he doesn't hold the deck like any of them. In fact, he deals like my grandmother used to when we were playing cribbage, deck held loosely while she pushed the cards off the side with her thumb. It's almost impossible to cheat successfully that way. It becomes even more ludicrous when someone says he spotted Norton as a cheater because of his 'mechanic's grip'.The director, John Dahl, obviously did a lot of research to make this film. His objective was not to film a clever story line. His objective was to make an accurate portrayal of poker today and describe some its psychological properties. Dahl had some good technical advisors. There are frequent references to Doyle Brunson and some unattributed quotes from his books. Johnny Chan is shown in newsreel footage, but not filmed for the movie and his lines are obviously dubbed. Director Dahl's film, while not perfection, has done a good job of showing what today's poker is really like. In doing so, he's also recruited many players for the WSOP and other tournaments.Silver Dollar Sam ","genre":null},{"date":"25 October 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Rounders is considered the cinema spokesman for present day poker.
