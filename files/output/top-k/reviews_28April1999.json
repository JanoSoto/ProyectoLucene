I have a young child and there is no way I would allow myself to be separated from her as easily as Jim's parents did, especially his father.

I didn't even get the feeling that his parents really cared that much and they had a very difficult time recognizing their only son. You spend 2 hours watching this young boy grow up in an interment camp without the film ever attempting to show the struggle of his parents to find him. This was a glaring weakness that I just can not look past.John Malkovich's character reminded me of someone out of the Mad Max movies (go figure) and added nothing.  Empire never penetrated to the heart of the characters and didn't penetrate my heart either.  Where was the storytelling in this film?  None of the characters were developed fully to identify with their struggles. Jim did not have enough substance to be the entire focus of the film. Aside from a few good cinematographic moments, this movie was way too long and way to dull.  It is different than most movies you will ever see, but that doesn't make it good.  I rank this Steven Spielberg film along with Amistad as his worst.  Forgive me for giving an honest opinion.

Great movie! Great experience! and then they turn it into a series, and you say Hey! She doesn't fit the part, and what the heck is that guy doing there? Well, this is one ocassion where that is really screwing me up.First, let me say that it was a great experience. And rather odd. Becoming a reluctant fan of the show is one thing. It gets beamed into your house and sometimes there ain't much else on. You get sort of bored and you say to yourself, Eh, guess I'll watch this. Then it becomes a favorite of yours by that simple process.Becoming a fan of a movie, a movie which you avoided like the plague for six long years, is something else altogether.I had a lot of fun watching this after one and a half years of watching the t.v. show. I expected something completely different. I thought it was going to be miserable after reading so much bad about it here and there on the internet and reviews in papers when it came out. I didn't go to see it in '92 because of those reviews. What a shame!After I've gotten to know Buffy (SMG, not Kristy Swanson) and Giles, Xander and Willow, etc. It was really enjoyable to be introduced to Buffy (Kristy) and Merrick, and Pike, and the Master, and especially Amilyn! (Paul Rueben)This was an extremely fine film and I have no clue why some cannot get over this film spawning the later series. Apart from a few wonderfully over the top performances (Ruebens and Rutger Hauer as Lothos), the movie has the same air about it. It's a lot sillier in places than the t.v. show will ever be.I'd venture a guess that if I had seen this film in '92, I'd have looked forward to a sequel. I don't think I would have foreseen the series though.They really are cousins, these two entities. The show is very much Beverly Hills, 90210 and X-Files meets Buffy the movie (With a heavy helping of Friday the 13th-The Series thrown in). Where as Buffy the Movie is closer to Fright Night, minus the gore.And Geez what great actors in such great little roles in such an overly criticized movie! Kristy Swanson's performance didn't make me hate Sarah Michelle Gellar. It didn't make me love her either. I can see something in each performance.I will say that the edge of believability has to go to Kristy's performance. She had the build for it. SMG is too small for the role, I think.And as for Rutger, well, I have to say that he has graced two films now that I enjoy! (The other being Nighthawks)As for Donald Sutherland as her watcher, understated performance there. Really well done job of creating a character to care about in only a few short scenes. It's almost a cameo! But Paul Ruebens as Amilyn steals it from Kristy about fifteen minutes from the end of the film. His scene near the end was beautiful!! Absurd and hilarious. I loved it!Of course, that's the thing about me. I take my vampires rather seriously. I must remember how good Fright Night was and how silly it was in places.

This film skillfully creates a central plot around Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) (who hears about 125 movie pitches per day), a studio executive who is being threatened by a writer whose script or idea he likely brushed off. But what is even more brilliant about The Player is everything going on peripherally to the main plot; all the references to studio techniques of film-making, foreign film movements, homages and Old Hollywood vs. New Hollywood. The film is multi-layered, yet everything that we view falls neatly into the formula which Hollywood film-making survives by. What we see in the duration of The Player would potentially make a perfect pitch for a movie. This may sound confusing, but watch the entire film, and you will immediately know what I mean.The film begins with a stunning homage to Alfred Hitchcock's Rope, an approximately eight minute long take where the camera moves freely around a studio encountering many people in the midst of their everyday routines. For example, we come across a couple discussing how Hollywood film is now much like MTV cut, cut, cut. One of the characters even uses the example of Rope to illustrate his point. Rope is approximately a ninety minute film that appears to have been shot all in one take. Of course, it wasn't done in one take, as reels of film at that time were only ten minutes long. If one watches the film very closely, it can be determined where the cuts are made.In the duration of the same take, we encounter Griffin Mill conducting business in his office. People walk into his office pitching movie ideas. It is here that we begin to learn about populist Hollywood film-making. Ideas, not stories or scripts are pitched to executives in 25 words or less. Almost always, the ideas thrown out are based on previous films (e.g. someone always gets killed at the end of a political thriller) and even combinations of previous films (e.g. It's Pretty Woman meets Out of Africa). When we see the usual films that are released into theaters each week, it is not difficult to believe that this is the way in which they are conceived. The usual Hollywood formula entails sex, violence, familiarity and most important of all happy endings, a movie always has to have a happy ending.The Player is filled with loads of Hollywood stars, most of them playing themselves. Jeff Goldblum, Malcolm McDowell, John Cusack, Angelica Huston, and Burt Reynolds to name a few. Many of them are encountered at restaurants during lunch and at night time Hollywood gatherings, where the topic of conversation is always movies. Near the beginning of the film, Griffin suggests that he and his lunch guests talk about something else. We're all educated adults. Of course no one says anything. Their lives are so indoctrinated by Hollywood, they do not know what else to talk about.Right from the beginning Griffin receives numerous postcards threatening his life. He begins to suspect a certain writer and goes to his house one night to confront him. The man turns out not to be home, but there is an incredible scene where Griffin talks with the man's girlfriend on the phone while voyeuristically watching her through the window. This is an extraordinary symbolization of the voyeuristic essence that goes along with watching a film, or the notion of scopophilia to be precise. The idea behind the concept of scopophilia is that the cinema constructs the spectator as a subject; the beholder of the gaze, who has an intense desire to look. The cinema places viewers in a voyeuristic position in that the viewer watches the film unseen in a dark room. While Griffin is watching the girl as he speaks with her, it is night time and he remains unseen to her. This scenario metaphorically represents the theater and the film.In the duration of Griffin's conversation on the phone, he finds out that the man he is looking for is watching The Bicycle Thief in an art-house theater in Pasadena. This film in itself represents the first contrast to Hollywood that we see in The Player. Vittorio DeSica's The Bicycle Thief was part of a movement that lasted from 1942 to 1952 called &#145;Italian Neo-Realism, whose other main exponents were Rossellini and Visconti. Rossellini called neo-realism both a moral and an aesthetic cinema. Neo-realism, to a great extent owes much of its existence to film-makers' displeasure at the restrictions placed on freedom of expression. This film movement is quite different from the modern Hollywood formula of film-making. When Griffin first meets the man he suspects is sending the postcards, he suggests that perhaps they could do a remake of The Bicycle Thief. The man responds with yeah sure, you'd probably want to give it a happy ending.Also interesting in The Player is one of the studio executives suggestions to newspapers as a source for script ideas. This serves to contrast Old Hollywood versus New Hollywood. In the older days of studio film, Warner Brothers (one of the studio's of middle-class America) would produce films with ideas seemingly drawn from real life or from the headlines of major newspapers. This gives us the sense that often Hollywood is stuck for original ideas, so ideas from the past re-circulate themselves.I have touched on only a few of the many interesting references that run peripherally to the main plot of The Player. The great thing is that even if you do not catch all the film references that I have been discussing, it is still enjoyable. When I first saw the film, I was really young and did not know much about movies, but yet I enjoyed it thoroughly. Now, it is one of my favorites. I definitely recommend it to anyone who has a keen interest in film.**** out of ****  ","genre":null},{"date":"28 April 1999","score":"91 out of 109 people found the following review useful","review":"  Come next year, when I am trying to devise a list of the best films of the 90's, Robert Altman's The Player will be near the top of my list.

For example, we come across a couple discussing how Hollywood film is now much like MTV cut, cut, cut. One of the characters even uses the example of Rope to illustrate his point. Rope is approximately a ninety minute film that appears to have been shot all in one take. Of course, it wasn't done in one take, as reels of film at that time were only ten minutes long. If one watches the film very closely, it can be determined where the cuts are made.In the duration of the same take, we encounter Griffin Mill conducting business in his office. People walk into his office pitching movie ideas. It is here that we begin to learn about populist Hollywood film-making. Ideas, not stories or scripts are pitched to executives in 25 words or less. Almost always, the ideas thrown out are based on previous films (e.g. someone always gets killed at the end of a political thriller) and even combinations of previous films (e.g. It's Pretty Woman meets Out of Africa). When we see the usual films that are released into theaters each week, it is not difficult to believe that this is the way in which they are conceived. The usual Hollywood formula entails sex, violence, familiarity and most important of all happy endings, a movie always has to have a happy ending.The Player is filled with loads of Hollywood stars, most of them playing themselves. Jeff Goldblum, Malcolm McDowell, John Cusack, Angelica Huston, and Burt Reynolds to name a few. Many of them are encountered at restaurants during lunch and at night time Hollywood gatherings, where the topic of conversation is always movies. Near the beginning of the film, Griffin suggests that he and his lunch guests talk about something else. We're all educated adults. Of course no one says anything. Their lives are so indoctrinated by Hollywood, they do not know what else to talk about.Right from the beginning Griffin receives numerous postcards threatening his life. He begins to suspect a certain writer and goes to his house one night to confront him. The man turns out not to be home, but there is an incredible scene where Griffin talks with the man's girlfriend on the phone while voyeuristically watching her through the window. This is an extraordinary symbolization of the voyeuristic essence that goes along with watching a film, or the notion of scopophilia to be precise. The idea behind the concept of scopophilia is that the cinema constructs the spectator as a subject; the beholder of the gaze, who has an intense desire to look. The cinema places viewers in a voyeuristic position in that the viewer watches the film unseen in a dark room. While Griffin is watching the girl as he speaks with her, it is night time and he remains unseen to her. This scenario metaphorically represents the theater and the film.In the duration of Griffin's conversation on the phone, he finds out that the man he is looking for is watching The Bicycle Thief in an art-house theater in Pasadena. This film in itself represents the first contrast to Hollywood that we see in The Player. Vittorio DeSica's The Bicycle Thief was part of a movement that lasted from 1942 to 1952 called &#145;Italian Neo-Realism, whose other main exponents were Rossellini and Visconti. Rossellini called neo-realism both a moral and an aesthetic cinema. Neo-realism, to a great extent owes much of its existence to film-makers' displeasure at the restrictions placed on freedom of expression. This film movement is quite different from the modern Hollywood formula of film-making. When Griffin first meets the man he suspects is sending the postcards, he suggests that perhaps they could do a remake of The Bicycle Thief. The man responds with yeah sure, you'd probably want to give it a happy ending.Also interesting in The Player is one of the studio executives suggestions to newspapers as a source for script ideas. This serves to contrast Old Hollywood versus New Hollywood. In the older days of studio film, Warner Brothers (one of the studio's of middle-class America) would produce films with ideas seemingly drawn from real life or from the headlines of major newspapers. This gives us the sense that often Hollywood is stuck for original ideas, so ideas from the past re-circulate themselves.I have touched on only a few of the many interesting references that run peripherally to the main plot of The Player. The great thing is that even if you do not catch all the film references that I have been discussing, it is still enjoyable. When I first saw the film, I was really young and did not know much about movies, but yet I enjoyed it thoroughly. Now, it is one of my favorites. I definitely recommend it to anyone who has a keen interest in film.**** out of ****  ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"28 April 1999","score":"91 out of 109 people found the following review useful","review":"  Come next year, when I am trying to devise a list of the best films of the 90's, Robert Altman's The Player will be near the top of my list. This film skillfully creates a central plot around Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) (who hears about 125 movie pitches per day), a studio executive who is being threatened by a writer whose script or idea he likely brushed off. But what is even more brilliant about The Player is everything going on peripherally to the main plot; all the references to studio techniques of film-making, foreign film movements, homages and Old Hollywood vs. New Hollywood. The film is multi-layered, yet everything that we view falls neatly into the formula which Hollywood film-making survives by.

I saw the enticing trailer, the HBO behind the scenes special, and the rave reviews of many respected critics, and said, I have to see this movie. Big mistake... This film is absolutely dreadful, quite possibly the worst sci-fi motion picture ever made, (even makes the first Star Trek look like a winner). Here is what's wrong with The Matrix...1) All special effects window dressing and loud noise, not a single trace of a story is present.2) Keanu Reeves (only action actor worse is Jean-Claude Van Damme).3) Long, drawn-out monologues trying to explain what the hell is going on when no one in the theater has a clue. This plot is so convoluted it makes Kubrick's 2001 read like a kindergarten pop-up book.4) Too much John Wooesque artsy-fartsy stuff when this film doesn't merit anything award winning.5) Keanu Reeves6) Impossible to even imagine any of this plausible to fill a plotline (I know we must suspend disbelief, but come on now).7) Too many characters and not enough with character.8) The violence is way too gratuitous, especially in the wake of  Columbine.9) Extremely poor acting (with the exception of Moss).10) AND FINALLY.....Keanu Reeves.To summarize, don't fall for the hype, this movie is so bad, it makes staying home to watch 90210 reruns a more appealing alternative on a Friday night.
