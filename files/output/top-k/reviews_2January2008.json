He doesn't penetrate as deeply beneath the surface as Maxwell does, but he's also incapable of the same bluntness as Zwick.I think he took on this project because it was easily adaptable to the structure he's used throughout his career characters in alternating groups of two, with scene changes corresponding to tonal shifts as the pairings merge, split, and converge into others.

Yes, it looks great, all those seasonal changes, his camera as deeply textured and languorous as ever, but we expect that from him.Of the three filmmakers' approaches, I value Maxwell's the most. His is the deepest, the richest, actually life-changing. He's just as good as the other two at drumming up all the visual detail for us but he also moves behind it to interpolate many contextual riches. He explicates narrative mechanics, connects them with 19th century ethics, and expounds on them with a highly abstract terminology. He isn't a cinematic innovator like Kurosawa, nor as eager for Lee and Zwick's more direct dramatizations. You won't find him with a dancing camera or editorial flourishes.

Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is the most highly acclaimed film to explore the dark underside of the war in Vietnam. It takes the viewer on a mythological journey through the war torn jungles of southeast Asia, but fails miserably to deliver what it sets into motion. The film promises good performances from its actors, and it delivers in that regard. The cast is loaded with talent, most notably that of Robert Duvall. His characters' presence in the film is short in duration, but very moving. In the beginning (like Platoon), Apocalypse Now seems to provide a glimpse into the psychological impact of an anarchic Vietnam on its wartime inhabitants. The film moves along nicely as Sheen journeys to find his imposter (Brando) who has concocted a dangerous cult following in the jungles of Cambodia. Several incidents along the way (again, like Platoon) give the viewer insight into how unstable wartime conditions manipulate every mans psyche.Up until this point, I thought the film was quite good. However, it takes a horrific turn for the worse when Sheens men stumble upon a family of French aristocracy still residing in Cambodia. At this point, the film jumps into a scene of pretentious political and social discourse about American involvement in the war. This miserably long scene broke the continuity of the film, as well as my interest. Trying desperately to recover from this editing atrocity, I try to stay optimistic about the films' direction. Unfortunately, its continuity is further interrupted by another unnecessary scene involving fuel exchange for sex. Still thinking it would revive itself, I tried to stay as optimistic as possible.Finally, Sheen and his patrol boat reach the site of Brando's cult followers, and the film plunges into absolute absurdity. It now takes the form of a cheesy pseudo sci-fi thriller, and plummets past the point of anything remotely reasonable. Disappointed by direction and exhausted from unnecessary extended footage, I had to finish the film. Brando's mythical character is enveloped in stereotypical, horroresque camera shots. The film now basks in all that is predictable and unreasonable. For filmgoers who wish to have your experience handed to you on a silver platter, this is a must see. Apocalypse Now is ruined by blatant disregard for fluidity and reason. Any philosophical implications the film wishes to provide are drastically overshadowed by a painfully cheesy and predictable story. At the end, it seems as if Coppola had no direction for his story. The ending seems forced and unnatural. If you must view, please find the original cut, not the Redux version. Oh the horror...

It's an American classic but it seems to have slipped through the net. It's about gangsters in an evolving world in which there is no place for them. They are a breed apart with their own language, codes and signs and while they may seem incongruous they are still capable of appalling violence. It's as if violence is the thing that feeds them.The central character is Jimmy 'The Saint', (Andy Garcia), an 'ex-gangster' who has gone legitimate by setting up a business in which people who are dying leave behind videos of their lives for their loves ones. (Even by going legitimate he can't pull himself away from death). He is asked to do one last job by a former associate, (Christoper Walken oozing malevolence from his wheelchair). 'It's not a piece of work, it's an action', Walken tells him. He's to put the frighteners on the guy who has stolen the girlfriend of Walken's crazy son, (it runs in the family), but when 'the action' goes horribly wrong Jimmy and his pals find themselves on Walken's hit-list.The trappings may be familiar; Scorcese and Tarantino have mined this territory recently to terrific effect but working from a great script by Scott Rosenberg, director Gary Fleder gives an almost surreal slant to the proceedings. It's almost as if these guys were aliens who have crash-landed in the real world and are at a loss when forced to communicate with the natives.The performances are uniformly sublime. Garcia has never been better; Walken, always brilliant, is extraordinary here and there is an Oscar-worthy turn from Christopher Lloyd in another career-best performance.

Based from a stage play, it pretty much works like that, but basically set outdoors. Russell (Theresa, that is), directs monologues at the camera in between interaction with various figures in her life. Be it her Brooks Brothers pimp (who looks more like a yuppie banker) or a pair of dopey foreigners she co-mingles with. Odd that Russell (the director) would choose not one, but two men of far-away descent for the female Russell to play off of. The first being what seems to be a Jamaican (though played by African-American actor Fargas) for midnight chats, and a clichéd Arab who says cutesy things like Will you be doing it without a rubber thing?. Russell's story darts about in different fashions, from flashbacks to in-the-moment pick-ups from customers. At one point director Russell even cuts to the pimp cruising the streets and waxing philosophical to the camera as well. Those expecting something gratuitous to munch popcorn to need to look elsewhere. Whoring is not glamorized here, with gang rapes, slashed hookers, and hateful tricks full of salty language. Once in a while (director) Russell lightens things up with throwaway gags (no pun) including a comical caning and a shoe-fetish nutbar who even comes with a small script. Physically, Russell is an effective choice for Liz, perhaps a little too pretty, but does sport a big butt and a few extra pounds. What distracts more is Russell's exceedingly uneven performance, one of the more mixed I've ever seen. Crossing an Elvira voice with a jr. high intellect, she captures your attention, though not always winningly. Part of the problem is the all-too-apparent dubbing of her voice for the street scenes. In order to remove the horns and whooshing of cars, her re-reading of lines is sometimes painful to listen to. Her quieter moments of pre-prostitution life work better, she being portrayed more as innocent and naive. Along with those scenes being shot indoors. The film sometimes lapses into inappropriate satire or bawdiness, then will slug you with broken fingers and slashed throats. It doesn't always work, but holds your attention. Sort of a reworking of Russell's far superior 1984 work, Crimes of Passion, with the same wise-assed hooker approach. Though that film was more straight-forward, and a had a three-character triangle of obsession, marital commentary, and redemption. Here the femme Russell is pretty much by herself, leading a more one-note lifestyle. Seek out Crimes for the better movie; seek out Whore for a gritty reality check.

Those expecting something gratuitous to munch popcorn to need to look elsewhere. Whoring is not glamorized here, with gang rapes, slashed hookers, and hateful tricks full of salty language. Once in a while (director) Russell lightens things up with throwaway gags (no pun) including a comical caning and a shoe-fetish nutbar who even comes with a small script. Physically, Russell is an effective choice for Liz, perhaps a little too pretty, but does sport a big butt and a few extra pounds. What distracts more is Russell's exceedingly uneven performance, one of the more mixed I've ever seen. Crossing an Elvira voice with a jr. high intellect, she captures your attention, though not always winningly. Part of the problem is the all-too-apparent dubbing of her voice for the street scenes. In order to remove the horns and whooshing of cars, her re-reading of lines is sometimes painful to listen to. Her quieter moments of pre-prostitution life work better, she being portrayed more as innocent and naive. Along with those scenes being shot indoors. The film sometimes lapses into inappropriate satire or bawdiness, then will slug you with broken fingers and slashed throats. It doesn't always work, but holds your attention. Sort of a reworking of Russell's far superior 1984 work, Crimes of Passion, with the same wise-assed hooker approach. Though that film was more straight-forward, and a had a three-character triangle of obsession, marital commentary, and redemption. Here the femme Russell is pretty much by herself, leading a more one-note lifestyle. Seek out Crimes for the better movie; seek out Whore for a gritty reality check.
