It was also highly stylised.  Some of the same elements can also be seen in Magnolia, his third film, but cut up into pieces and rearranged in a much larger collage.  Magnolia is an truly epic film, structured loosely around the terminal diseases of two elderly men.  Aided by an excellent ensemble cast, the film sweeps us through an ordinary\/extraordinary day in the lives of its characters with humour both wry and black.  Stand out performances come from John Reilly as a soft-hearted cop and Tom Cruise as a misogynistic motivational speaker; but no-one really puts a foot wrong.But this is not a conventionally naturalistic film.  The characterisation, plot and dialogue all have an air of deliberate contrivance this gives the film an undoubted style and mood, but at the expense of a certain depth.  The characters, for example, though highly original, are also unmistakably emblematic all seem conceived exactly to fit their purpose, nothing less but also nothing more.  The overall impression is almost that an (uncommonly sophisticated) outline or treatment, which could have the effect of emotionally distancing the viewer.  Anderson guards against this through skillful use of an intrusive soundtrack, and a perfect sense of judgment in when to cross-cut between the different tales.   Magnolia is a highly manipulative film (in the best of senses) the director achieves through artifice what the story alone might fail to accomplish.The real problem with such an ambitious venture is how to find an resonant ending that brings all the themes and plotlines together.  And here, sadly, Anderson gets it wrong.  His chosen conclusion is over-the-top, unnecessary and (quite literally) falls from the skies.  There's a reason why truth is sometimes stranger than fiction, and its even quoted in this film that there are things you wouldn't believe if they were invented.  But film makes this point immediately after ignoring it in practice; which is cool, or complacent, according to your fancy.Nonetheless, watching Magnolia makes for an engrossing three hours, and Paul Thomas Anderson is a master of his craft.  When he stops trying so hard, he will surely make a truly great movie.

Perhaps the films was 'lost', as it was made and released in-between the twin giants of the popcorn friendly Lost World and the more socially conscious Saving Private Ryan - a film Amistad resembles closely in terms of tone and style.  Amistad does not represent the popular Spielberg of ET, Jurassic Park or Jaws, rather the work of a mature film-maker, whose boyish preoccupations have given way to a thoughtful, politically astute adult who - in spite of what many of his critics say - isn't afraid of tackling darker themes.Following the real-life plight of a group of African slaves who, in 1839 committed violent mutiny aboard the eponymous Spanish slave ship, Amistad is unlike anything Spielberg has done before.  Only the similarly adult and underrated Empire of the Sun and The Color Purple (which also deals with issues of race and freedom) share such social and political concerns.  The freedom of the slaves, represented by their hugely powerful leader Cinque (an almost wordless yet towering Djimon Hounsou) is bitterly contested by their Spanish owners and the Americans who salvaged the ship. With the help of two anti-slavery campaigners, Theodore Joadson (the always brilliant Morgan Freeman), Lewis Tappan (Stellan Skarsgard) and idealistic property lawyer Roger Baldwin (an excellent Matthew McConaughey) the slaves case eventually engages the the services of former President John Quincy Adams (a masterful Anthony Hopkins), who argues brilliantly on their behalf in the Supreme Court.During the trial of the slaves, Spielberg shows us their capture in Africa and subsequent horrific journey to Africa aboard La Amistad in unflinching detail.  The  brutality and sense of injustice one feels as we watch slaves being drowned by their captors is as powerful as anything in Schindler's List.  The cinematography, by Janusz Kaminski, is stunning throughout, leaving permanent images in the mind - the slaves drowning in the water, Cinque literally trying to swim back to Africa rather than face capture and the stunning opening mutiny set-piece.  There are none of the huge, sweeping camera moves that we usually associate with Spielberg in Amistad; instead, he employs an almost static camera throughout (albeit with beautiful lighting) - the better to focus on the human drama.Every performance in the film is exemplary, the screenplay (by David Franzoni) literary, intelligent and compassionate.  Overall, Amistad adds up to one of the best films Spielberg has ever directed.  The fact that it is not more widely known is criminal - hopefully it will be rediscovered, reassessed and given the acclaim it deserves.  If you are even remotely interested in American history, slavery, African-American issues, Steven Spielberg or just great cinema, you really must see Amistad.

He causes havoc on the place, but especially on the head Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). Some of the people he lives with is Harding (William Redfield), Martini (Danny DeVito), Sefelt (William Duell), Bancini (Josip Elic), Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), and Taber (Christopher Lloyd).I really had no idea what to rate this movie it's dramatic but not too dramatic, it's funny but not too funny. I felt inspired, but I had many complaints about it. First off, I felt like it didn't have a central plot. IMDb.com says `A man sent to a mental hospital finds the head nurse a lot more dangerous than the other patients.' I agree, but we really have no connection between the two. Besides a few arguments, we have nothing to back that up. If it was concentrated more on that than on unnecessary sidetrips, such as when Randle took everyone on a field trip fishing. I see that that shows how he's connecting and how crazy he's becoming, but if it had been removed so more of the initial plot could come underway, it would have helped.Even without music for a lot of the time, I felt like I was being touched by this movie, mainly at the end. However, it doesn't have a central message or theme. It was heart wrenching at times, even over the littlest things, but for a lot of the time it was just `a movie'. I don't want you to think the wrong thing, I enjoyed and liked this movie.Nicholson, who is McMurphy, was excellent yet again. Fletcher was good, but would have been better if she was in more scenes, considering she's the second largest star of the film. She, as Ratched, wanted routine and routine only. I didn't really think she was `dangerous', but if it had been a longer movie, it could have worked. I thought that all of the mental patients were great, especially Lloyd (it was his debut, as was DeVito's).I did notice a few things that I didn't think would happen in real life. First, I wouldn't think that they would allow smoking in a hospital. Also, I noticed that throughout the entire movie, McMurphy didn't have the hospital gowns that everyone else had.

Bond is way too nice to his adversaries, often conversing with them as if they are his good friends. Sean Connery's Bond would never say thank you after being roughed up and shoved out a door. This problem stains the entire movie, and led me to question Bond's good judgment. Moore would get better, but he is caught in a weak plot involving drug smuggling and the voodoo nonsense of Baron Saturday.The air of absurdity materializes as early as the pre-title sequence, where a British agent watches a funeral procession that turns out being his own. This is one of three rather ludicrous killings that melt into Paul McCartney's famous title song. Unfortunately, the best theme in the series is the high point of the movie. Any hope that will improvement will come thoroughly dashed within fifteen minutes.Bond starts an investigation of the three aforementioned murders, all connected to Dr. Kananga (Yaphet Kotto), the prime minister of a small island nation. Bond's mission takes him to Harlem, where he discovers a link between Kananga and criminal mobster Mr. Big, both later revealed to be the same person. Aiding Kananga\/Mr. Big is a lusciously beautiful tarot card reader named Solitaire (Jane Seymour) and a vast organization of stereotyped cronies.Live and Let Die is a flop in nearly every way. In addition to Moore's poor rendition of Bond, the action is lackluster, the characters are irritating, the soundtrack is terrible, the style is incongruous, and the film is racist. All the black people use fractured blackspeak and are either drug dealers or mob enforcers. Adam (Tommy Lane) orders some lazy henchmen to chase Bond saying, The man who gets him stays alive! Now MOVE YOU MOTHERS! Later, he encounters hick Sheriff J.W. Pepper (Clifton James) and risks his organization's entire plot by not shooting him.Pepper is also an annoying, negative stereotype who undermines the film's best scene. Writer Tom Mankiewicz says he included Pepper so he could make fun of all groups equally. Since when are the Bond films about making fun of people? I bet Albert Broccoli would have shuddered if he heard during the making of From Russia with Love that the series would one day come to this.Finally, the movie's climax is poorly written and executed. Bond carelessly leaves one of his weapons lying around for anyone to find, leaving him defenseless. It is the second time that he essentially allows himself to be captured. Maybe Mankiewicz and director Guy Hamilton were just looking for an excuse to create a brawl. Moore was never particularly good at brawls.Despite its myriad of flaws, Live and Let Die has three positives. The most obvious one is Solitaire, Kananga's radiant mistress and the film's best character. Solitaire is intentionally vulnerable, and Seymour understands that well. As for the eye candy, Solitaire is arguably the most physically attractive Bond girl.The other two positives are Kananga and his aide Tee-Hee (Julius W. Harris). Not surprisingly they are the only two non-stereotyped blacks. Kotto plays Kananga as an intelligent, well-expressed man who is in complete control of his emotions. Only Max Zorin is a more effective Moore era villain. Bond and Tee-Hee's train fight at the end is one of the few jewels of Moore's time although it does not approach the original in From Russia with Love. The idea of a bad guy trying to kill Bond after the victory is won occurred in five of the eight films by this point and lost its appeal.As far as 007 adventures go, Live and Let Die is one of the worst despite its three good characters.

When seraching for astronauts Harry Shearer's character praises Yeager as the ace of aces, but goes on to say that he doesn't fit the profile of the type of man Washington is looking for because he never went to college. This was a true pre-requisite which the Mercury Program had.  Also, the scene at the end where Yeager crashes his NF-104 doesn't bring him down, it glorifies him. Gordo Cooper even comments that he gets on the cover of magazines, gets a free car, free lunches all across America, a free home with all the furnishings and loads of money and I ain't even been up there yet. He's famous because he's an astronaut alone - not because of anything he's done.  Kaufman cuts back and forth between the scene where Cooper is with Yeager's flight in the desert for reason. Yeager's almost alone with no media around, out in the desert attempting a record which won't put him on Life Magazine's cover. He's trying to set a record because that's what he's made of. He has The Right Stuff; which is something Cooper reazlies as we cut back to the reception and Gordo is asked by the reporters who the best pilot he ever saw was.  Yeager may have crashed his plane in his last flight of the movie, but he emerges as a fearless man ever up for the challenge. And that he's not doing any of it for fame or fortune (although in real life the real Yeager cashed in with TV ads and a best-selling autobiography after both the book and the movie were released!!).  That's what's rare about this movie for Hollywood to have made. Films are almost never about measuring a man's inner desires, but rather his being able to win the fight at the end. Yeager in contrast doesn't win the flight record at the film's end, but he is still the hero. This is because he dares to do what we never would. And even after his plane crashes he walks out of the gulf of fire and smoke with a severely burned face as if he will be back; you can't keep him down.  This is why as the rescuer driving the ambulance as he sees Yeager's figure walking out of the fire in the distance asks, Is that a man?, Jack Ridley replies, You're damn right it is!. Ridley isn't merely remarking that it's a man over there, he is commenting that in our world Yeager is one of the few true men.  This film is not about the space program. That is merely a pretext to explore the type of men who have what it takes to volunteer for dangerous missions - even in times of peace. It's about men who have The Right Stuff - and of all those men whom we see in the movie it is Yeager who shines about all others.

Yeager in contrast doesn't win the flight record at the film's end, but he is still the hero. This is because he dares to do what we never would. And even after his plane crashes he walks out of the gulf of fire and smoke with a severely burned face as if he will be back; you can't keep him down.  This is why as the rescuer driving the ambulance as he sees Yeager's figure walking out of the fire in the distance asks, Is that a man?, Jack Ridley replies, You're damn right it is!. Ridley isn't merely remarking that it's a man over there, he is commenting that in our world Yeager is one of the few true men.  This film is not about the space program. That is merely a pretext to explore the type of men who have what it takes to volunteer for dangerous missions - even in times of peace.

It's not that he turned down the opportunity to apply to be an astronaut, it's that Chuck Yeager wasn't allowed to apply. When seraching for astronauts Harry Shearer's character praises Yeager as the ace of aces, but goes on to say that he doesn't fit the profile of the type of man Washington is looking for because he never went to college. This was a true pre-requisite which the Mercury Program had.  Also, the scene at the end where Yeager crashes his NF-104 doesn't bring him down, it glorifies him. Gordo Cooper even comments that he gets on the cover of magazines, gets a free car, free lunches all across America, a free home with all the furnishings and loads of money and I ain't even been up there yet. He's famous because he's an astronaut alone - not because of anything he's done.  Kaufman cuts back and forth between the scene where Cooper is with Yeager's flight in the desert for reason. Yeager's almost alone with no media around, out in the desert attempting a record which won't put him on Life Magazine's cover. He's trying to set a record because that's what he's made of. He has The Right Stuff; which is something Cooper reazlies as we cut back to the reception and Gordo is asked by the reporters who the best pilot he ever saw was.  Yeager may have crashed his plane in his last flight of the movie, but he emerges as a fearless man ever up for the challenge. And that he's not doing any of it for fame or fortune (although in real life the real Yeager cashed in with TV ads and a best-selling autobiography after both the book and the movie were released!!).

Larry Clark isn't one of my favorite directors because the subjects that he bases his movies on aren't really what I prefer to watch over and over again.  But Kids was a pretty good movie.  It had excellent acting for amateur actors and the camera action wasn't the best, but okay. Story and plot was original and very interesting. I thought the idea to make this film was brilliant. Korine's part in the film was hilariously awesome character. He is a funny guy. I guess over all i loved Kids. And i love Harmony Korine, Larry Clark is an alright director i guess, and its cool if he just wants to direct teen sex films the rest of his life, im just sayin that gets boring to me. My favorite part in the whole movie is the scene where the black guy gets beaten down even though there were a few bloopers.  The second thing I liked about Kids is the music, it fit.  Hard rock and metal went right along with the lives of the kids.  The thing I hated most about Kids is Telly's voice and the way he talks, he talks like a damn retard.  I also hated the photography because the camera angles and movements were just a little bit to shaky.  My favorite character was Casper, he was funny.  What makes this movie so attractive to me is the realism, superb acting, and awesome script. A lot of people can't handle this movie because they are scared of the real world and live sheltered lives.  This movie doesn't hold back and sheltered people don't have any business watching it. So come in ready to see a realistic movie, (make sure you have an open mind)  Overall, I liked it and I give it a 7.5 out of 10. See Harmony Korine's Gummo especially is your a Peter Jackson fan.

Ice Age finally delivers the goods through Blue Sky.This is well animated than Walt Disney Pictures's own prehistoric trek Dinosaur but a better movie all told, because it has characters on its side - a sloth and mammoth trailing behind in the annual migration to get away from the winter discover a human baby (given to them by his mother, who dies in escaping a tiger attack) and take it on themselves to return the child to his people before the snow sets in and closes the only route available. If dave-hart is reading this, the reason they're joined by a sabretooth tiger called Diego is that he's been sent by the leader of his group to get the baby from Sid the sloth and Manfred the mammoth (I see - can't have kids of your own, so you want to adopt) and bring him back, so that his revenge can be complete; the tigers attacked the humans because the baby's father hunted the tigers. As Mrs Loman put it, Attention must be paid.The storyline won't win any awards for originality, but the movie has plenty of points of interest (the mute human characters - You know humans can't talk! - in accordance with the true first settlers of America, have distinctly Native American looks), and enough humour and genuine appeal to win over most viewers; the flock of survivalist dodos preparing for the imminent Ice Age are my favourites among the subsidary characters, but the three main characters all get to share the spotlight.

It's an OOP book that contains the cutting continuity of Welles' original cut.  It shows what was cut and where it was cut.I have to say that the cuts aren't all bad.  Of course the cuts from the ball hurt, the cut ending was more pessimistic but still better than the release version.  But then there are little lines cut here and there that actually don't hurt the film.  And frankly there are one or two whole scenes that were cut and actually help the film.  But then I have other problems with the film.  Agnes Moorehead should have been cast as Isabel as Fanny is an annoying character that isn't sympathetic.  Delores Costello is wooden and her character shows no affection for Eugene.  Tim Holt does an excellent job but how can you sympathize with his character at the end when he was such a total jerk up till that point.  Overall, the film comes off to me as a grand soap opera.And also don't believe that the studio blindsided Welles and destroyed this film without authority.  In order to get it made, his contract was renegotiated and one of the things he gave up was final cut.  Therefore, the studio could do anything they wanted.I know many Welles fans consider this a masterpiece.  Don't get me wrong, I think he was a master and I'd do anything to see all of his films released as they should have be.  But I think he made a mistake choosing this film as his follow-up to Kane.
