[{"date":"6 March 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The war against drugs, of which we are fighting a losing battle, was effectively brought to the screen in 2000 in Traffic but the reason we are fighting this battle, the horrors of drug addiction itself and what it can bring you to, was the focus of another winner from 2000 called Requiem for a Dream, a bone-chilling look at the horror of drug addiction and the virus that the business behind it has become.The film, brilliantly realized by director Darren Aronofsky, weaves together three stories about drug addiction that clearly demonstrate that addiction does not discriminate and that no matter how an addiction starts or for what alleged positive purpose was its genesis, once the line has been crossed from recreational use into addiction (and we never know when that line is actually crossed), we all begin the same swift, downward spiral into a quicksand of consequences that usually leads to one of three places jails, institutions, or death.The primary and most heartbreaking story revolves around a middle-aged woman named Sara Goldfarb, played by Ellen Burstyn, in a powerhouse performance that should have won her an Oscar, who begins taking diet pills so that she can fit into a particular dress that she wants to wear when she appears on her favorite television show, an event for which she has been planning for years, but has received no confirmation that it's actually going to happen. This story is particularly unsettling to watch because when we think of drug abuse we don't think about middle-aged women and we don't think about diet pills as being dangerous, but Sara's obsession to lose weight takes her to such a dark place that she starts hallucinating that her refrigerator is talking to her. Burstyn effortlessly imbues Sara with a sadness and confusion about what is happening to her that is positively haunting.Jared Leto plays Sara's son, Harry, a recreational drug user who is so deeply steeped in his own addiction that he doesn't see what is happening to his mother and decides that he and his running partner (Marlon Wayans), should start selling drugs but really don't have a clue as to what they're doing, evidenced by their complete ignorance about the first rule of selling drugs Don't get high on your own supply. Watching Harry and his buddy's downfall is so pathetic because we can see all the mistakes they are making even if they don't.Jennifer Connelly turns in the performance of her career as Harry's girlfriend, Marian, whose casual use of drugs with Harry gets so out of control that Harry can't keep enough drugs around for her so she has to go elsewhere looking for them and doesn't care what she has to do to get that high she so desperately craves. Marian's addiction finds her taking prostitution to a dangerous place she never imagined, yet at the same time, not terribly concerned about how easy it is to get what she wants, using nothing more than her body.Hubert Selby's screenplay, based on his own book, pulls no punches and offers no apologies for this twisted look at drug addiction that, to the uninitiated viewer might seem a little over-the-top, but for those who have ever dealt with addiction or love someone who has dealt with it, there are emotions and events and images presented here that have a basis in reality. Aronofsky's bold directorial vision and some spectacular performances, especially Ellen Burstyn, make this film worth watching...it's not an easy watch, but there are rewards to be had here and it might actually make you think twice the next time someone offers to buy you a beer.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"6 March 2015","score":"","review":" Movies about the mob have been part of cinema history for decades, but never was life as a mobster made to look more glamorous and more alluring than it was presented in Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpiece Goodfellas, a sweeping cinematic epic that spans several decades in the lives of a select group of men working their way up through the social strata of the syndicate.The film opens on the childhood of one Henry Hill (a real person BTW, who is now in the Witness Protection Program), a teen who started his career with the mob as an errand boy and was paid handsomely for his efforts. It's a little unsettling the way the mob draws Henry in and makes what he does seem so glamorous and exciting, but Nicholas Pileggi's screenplay brilliantly shines light on the allure of life in the mob. Even though we know it's wrong, the way the director and screenwriter make it completely understandable. There's something rather pathetic about the fact that when a teenage Henry is arrested for the first time, the fact that he keeps his mouth shut about his employers, makes him the new hero of this dangerous inner circle and that he will be protected by them for life.The inner circle includes a couple of career mobsters Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci) who take the adult Henry (now played by Ray Liotta) under their wing and the sometimes conflicted emotions Henry goes through when he realizes some of the things that are required of him. The movie's opening is proof of this as we see Jimmy, Tommy, and Henry in a car with a body in a trunk which they are preparing to bury somewhere in New Jersey. Despite the rampant ugliness that is a part of this life, the perks seem to outweigh the ugliness for Henry until he is in so deep that he can't get out, to the point where his job has direct correlations to the Don, Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino) who treats Henry like a son until he learns that Henry has branched out into his own side business that has threatened the primary business and everyone involved.Scorcese has created a world that looks impossible to resist and it is very easy to understand how Hill got pulled in, and as we all know, once you're in, you never get out. Eventually, Henry was in so much trouble, his only alternative to being whacked was selling out.The cast is absolutely perfect, led by De Niro as Conway and a star- making performance by Ray Liotta as Henry Hill. Liotta is sexy and charismatic as Hill and no matter what Hill does, Liotta always makes the viewer sympathize with Henry, no matter what he's going through. Joe Pesci won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his outrageous performance as Tommy, which produces equal doses of laughs and chills, whether he is amusing cronies with wild stories, beating the crap out of old buddies, or borrowing a shovel from his clueless mom to help bury a body in the trunk of his car while he is at mom's dinner table eating pasta. Lorraine Braco received a supporting actress nomination for her fiery performance as Karen, Henry's wife who turns a blind eye to what her husband is doing because the perks for her seem to be even better than the perks Henry gets. Paul Sorvino commands the screen as Big Paulie and Catherine Scorsese (the director's mother) is adorable as Tommy's mother.Scorsese's cinematic eye for violence and shock is in full view here, creating a glamorous look at mob life that doesn't minimize the violence and ugliness that comes along with it. The art direction and divine musical score also deserve mention here. The film and Scorsese were both robbed of Oscars...in a word, a masterpiece.

So up from the mayor Karl (Crisp), the minister Paul Ford (Malden), down to her house staff, assistant Nancy (Olson), cook Tillie (Shaw) and maid Angelica (Canfield), everyone is either intimidated by her supremacy or surrendered to the vested interest involved.Therefore, Pollyanna's arrival is destined to break the unhealthy equilibrium and bring her ingenuously sanguine school of thought into the town by winning over everyone! It will hardly work in an authentically cynical world, but thankfully it is in Disneyland, the stranger- shunning recluse Mr. Pendergast (Menjou in his final silver screen presence) is actually a Mr. Nice Guy, and the cantankerous bed-ridden Mrs. Snow (Moorehead, shines in her scene-stealing bellyaching) is no more than a big baby just needs a little bit of motivation. Even Reverend Ford can be generously granted a thorough catharsis through Pollyanna's seemingly unintentional chit-chat. The point is in Harrington's Town, there is no evil, even for Aunt Polly, she is never malevolent, in fact she is just shackled by her self-appointed lofty duty to act as a role model for the townsfolk, as discreetly as possible. Her strong intention to maintain the ancient orphanage is more for the building's legacy other than her own sake, albeit a better solution is to build a new one. So, things can have been tread lightheartedly until DP Russell Harlan's ominous overlooking shots raise no less fear for agoraphobic than Hitchcock's VERTIGO (1958, 8\/10), also amps up the suspense is Paul J. Smith's ferociously taut accompanying score which in most of time is as jolly as a bumblebee in the spring. For those who haven't read the novel from Eleanor H. Porter (me included), it is a shocking twist, and in one second, we may even believe we will lose her forever, only if it was true, the film would be worshiped for its groundbreaking bravura and gutsy dare to defy Disney's family-friendly quintessence. Although it turns out to be a bluff, the movie is excellent in at least tricking me into believe it even for a split second. Hayley Mills won a Juvenile Award in the Oscars, which in my opinion, the Academy should keep it aside from the usual acting branch (in that case we could have avoided the glaring category fraud cases such as Hailee Seinfeld and Tatum O'Neal), Mills is quite distinctive from other cherubic child sensations, she is neither a pretty doll nor a resplendent princess, she is plainly approachable, Mills illuminates the screen with her refined line-delivery and urgent sincerity without ever over-acting or dumbing down to memories by rote. Jane Wyman also establishes a powerhouse omnipresence in her absolute wheelhouse, never flaunts in the abysmally ambiguous villain categorization where she is, her aunt Polly is a victim of overpriced dignity, she enriches her with every bit of nuance which may not in the script. Most supporting characters are cartoon-ish, Richard Egan is quite a dull as Dr. Chilton and Nancy Olson is unprecedentedly harsh at the beginning, but Karl Malden's hectoring Sunday sermon is very amazing to watch and not to go deep into religion, people are either too devout or put-upon to hear it for three years, still is not long enough to brainwash their simpleton minds.

All in all he might have got the men, but it is all just a bloody mess. The performances are all good ones, and the direction, camera-work and editing all add the sense of dread and help heighten the tension.The director is Carl Franklin who made another great but overlooked film in Devil In A Blue Dress. If you are able to catch this - though I don't know how because it doesn't seem to be shown on TV - do so. You won't regret spending time on what is something of a gem.

We get any amount of top-budget, CGI-heavy dreck which go on to catch the headline - albeit for a week or two - but other films, such as One False Move, which proudly stands head and shoulders over its rivals is barely noticed.The story is simple and effectively told. There are no false histrionics, there is no grandstanding, the violence and horrific murders are not celebrated in that god-awful balletic way favoured by Tarantino and his ilk, and the whole thing is presented to the viewer on the assumption that the viewer has a brain.Yet despite its undoubted quality One False Move slips past and is 'just another film'.

She's single and nothing much is going on. She seems cheerful enough about it all but she decides to begin life anew, starting a diary and making resolutions such as losing fourteen pounds and cutting down on the drinking and smoking.Zellweger works in a London publishing house and begins to wear short skirts and rather vulgar see-through blouses to the office. Soon enough she's flirting with her boss, the ever sly Hugh Jackman, and soon after than they're in the sack together. She begins to get a bit mushy and asks him if he loves her. For that, he buggers her for the second time.Well -- does he love her? Is he willing to commit? (That's code for willing to get married.) Evidently not, because she pays him an unexpected visit one day and finds a luscious babe naked in his bath room. The babe eyes Zellweger with a smirk and remarks, I thought you said she was THIN. Ouch.Meanwhile, always hovering around the background, is the successful but stuffy and decidedly unchic Colin Firth. Zellweger has loathed him at first sight. He never smiles or flirt or jokes around like the roguish Jackman. Not much fun, you know. But one day he takes her aside and tells her grimly that he likes her just the way she is. Coming from him, that's a Niagara Falls of a confession. In the meantime, though, Jackman has abandoned all his girl friends and tells Zellweger she can give him rebirth. That is, he's now willing to get married and so, it develops, is Firth.At a dinner one night at Zellweger's flat, Jackman and Firth run into one another and have a fist fight over her. Now this has got to be female fantasy Number One -- two men fighting over you, a plain girl with not much going for her but brains and zest. And they're both successful and have other women salivating over them. Wow. I won't claim it began with Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice because I'm sure the theme goes back in history through the Greek masques, and is lost finally in the mists of antiquity. (For men's fantasy Number One, viz., The Conquering Hero. Start with Rocky. Go back to The Iliad.) Much of the wit lies in the writing itself, full of irony and vulgarity. There are a few slapstick scenes -- Bridget trying to cook -- that hark back to I Love Lucy and Laurel and Hardy. They're still funny and the absurd characters are well defined.Zellweger is a decent actress and though hefty she has an engaging blue eyes and a smile that could brighten a room. Jackman is his usual on-screen self, stuttering slightly, a little embarrassed at times. Firth is unpleasant and stiff but Zellweger has juice enough for both of them and she'll turn him into a paragon of élan before you know it.

It's not just an epic in terms of length, but also in terms of the themes of love, adventure and cultural exchange which it addresses. It is a richly detailed portrayal of one man's enlightenment and transformation that should cut to the heart of anyone who watches it. Kevin Costner plays Lieutenant John J. Dunbar, wounded during the Civil War in Tennessee and, at his request, transferred to the frontier. When he arrives there, he finds his post deserted. While there, he eventually meets the Lakota Sioux and strikes up a friendship with them that develops over the course of the film. One thing (among many) that this film does right is portray Native Americans in a more sympathetic light compared to film portrayals in the past. Here they aren't noble savages, but people just living off the land who have a rich culture and history. The Pawnee aren't portrayed as kindly, but in the context of the film this is OK as they are enemies of the Sioux. This leads to the bigger issue of American imperialism and the Monroe Doctrine which, while never directly addressed as such, was a major source of tension between the US and Indian tribes in the 19th century. Yes, we stole land that they had been living on for generations and the film is bold enough to admit that. Aside from issues, DANCES WITH WOLVES manages to just tell a good story with richly detailed characters that has dramatic heft and palpable emotional impact. There are a number of sequences which display Costner's eye for good cinema and show a firm directorial hand at work. One such sequence takes place about halfway through and shows Dunbar and the Sioux hunting a herd of buffalo on the plain. There are also a few battle sequences which are brilliantly filmed. The only minor complaints I have are that the US soldiers towards the end are portrayed as villains in a somewhat cartoonish way. While certainly not saints, I feel like they were portrayed that way on purpose so as to make the Native Americans look that much more like the heroes. I can see why this was done, but I don't feel like it was entirely necessary to vilify them in such a broad way. I also think that despite the importance of the events that the film portrays, and the way in which it portrays them, that in the end it's merely a crowd-pleasing epic. Nothing truly profound is said about the human condition and our relationships with one another, as seems to be the film's intention. It has the slight air of being a cinematic apology a rather sincere one, but still a little pretentious. I'm not quite sure if this film deserved to win Best Picture in 1991, as there were a lot of strong contenders that year, but it certainly was a high point for Kevin Costner's career and is definitely worth seeing.

Jacy eventually chooses Duane and Sonny then actually drifts into an affair with the lonely wife of his football coach (Cloris Leachman).Filmed in beautiful black and white, this movie evokes a period feeling and teenage sexual awakenings better than just about any film that came out of the 70's. Bogdanovich pulled rich performances from his cast with Bottoms giving a star-making performance as Sonny, Ben Johnson won a Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Sam the Lion, the local businessman who pretty much runs the town and Leachman won supporting actress, though, personally, I think that award should have gone to Ellen Burstyn, who is just luminous as Jacy's mother.A beautiful and lovely drama that will entertain and haunt.

It turns out the exploding planet is the Klingon moon from which they mine a good deal of their resources. Sulu hails the Klingon moon where he is told to move along nothing to see here, right before that particular Klingon lets out an agonized scream and presumably dies. Should we report this Sir? Sulu is asked. Are you kidding? Apparently he was, because next thing we know, the Klingon empire is on its knees with Chancellor Gorkon (a heavily made up David Warner who was also in the fifth film as a different character) looking to cut a peace deal and end 40 or so years of hostility. Wait a minute, does this sound familiar? Of course it does. It was 1991, we'd just lived through it with Nato and the USSR, and in many ways were still living through it then. Anyway we see some of the best character moments for the whole series in the next few minutes, As we find out Spock is leading the peace delegation and has nominated Kirk and the Enterprise to rendezvous with the captain. The tension between Spock and Kirk could be cut through with a knife and it leads to one of Shatner's finest moments as he monologues I have never trusted Klingons, and I never will. I will never forgive them for the death of my son. They have an amusing and tense dinner with Gorkon and his Party where we find out that Guess who's coming to Dinner works for pretty good comedy and also that Chistopher Plummer is in this movie as Klingon General Chang. We are roughly half an hour in and this already has by far the best script of any film in the series.Unfortunately for Kirk Christopher Plummer, Kim Catrall, a federation captain and some random Romulan have all conspired to assassinate Gorkon to stop the peace process. Kirk is accused of the murder along with Bones. Someone taped Kirk's monologue (OK it was Kim Catrall) and he is found guilty and sent to a prison planet to die.The scenes in the prison are the film's worst and it's also where the script loses the plot as this is clearly being added to increase the run time, makes little sense and adds nothing to the plot. Kirk and Bones escape with help from Spock and they are able to foil the attempt to stop the peace process.The ending is suitably moving, with Kirk making a nice speech about the future, and hope, being the Undiscovered Country. And off they fly for the last time, the major characters all signing their names in the final credits.This was a fitting end to an enjoyable film series. It has some tremendous character moments and really does feel like both their individual and collective journeys are complete. It left the slate clean for the Next Generation to take over the film series, and had some of the best and intelligent character work of any of the films, if only we could lose that part in the prison planet.

It turns out the exploding planet is the Klingon moon from which they mine a good deal of their resources. Sulu hails the Klingon moon where he is told to move along nothing to see here, right before that particular Klingon lets out an agonized scream and presumably dies. Should we report this Sir? Sulu is asked. Are you kidding? Apparently he was, because next thing we know, the Klingon empire is on its knees with Chancellor Gorkon (a heavily made up David Warner who was also in the fifth film as a different character) looking to cut a peace deal and end 40 or so years of hostility. Wait a minute, does this sound familiar? Of course it does. It was 1991, we'd just lived through it with Nato and the USSR, and in many ways were still living through it then. Anyway we see some of the best character moments for the whole series in the next few minutes, As we find out Spock is leading the peace delegation and has nominated Kirk and the Enterprise to rendezvous with the captain. The tension between Spock and Kirk could be cut through with a knife and it leads to one of Shatner's finest moments as he monologues I have never trusted Klingons, and I never will. I will never forgive them for the death of my son. They have an amusing and tense dinner with Gorkon and his Party where we find out that Guess who's coming to Dinner works for pretty good comedy and also that Chistopher Plummer is in this movie as Klingon General Chang. We are roughly half an hour in and this already has by far the best script of any film in the series.Unfortunately for Kirk Christopher Plummer, Kim Catrall, a federation captain and some random Romulan have all conspired to assassinate Gorkon to stop the peace process. Kirk is accused of the murder along with Bones. Someone taped Kirk's monologue (OK it was Kim Catrall) and he is found guilty and sent to a prison planet to die.The scenes in the prison are the film's worst and it's also where the script loses the plot as this is clearly being added to increase the run time, makes little sense and adds nothing to the plot.

In addition to appearing in that year's Oscar winning Best Picture, In the Heat of the Night and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?, he created one of his most endearing characters, making To Sir, With Love, one of the best movies ever made about high school students changed by the dedication of one teacher.Based on the book by ER Braithwaite, Poitier plays Mark Thackeray, a recent engineering school graduate unable to get a job in that field, who accepts a job teaching at a school in the slums of London's east end, teaching high school age students and the lengths to which he goes to reach these kids.Not only does Thackeray have to deal with the kids' bigotry, but realizes that normal teaching methods are not going to work as most of the kids are barely literate and have no social skills whatsoever and it is when Thackeray decides to throw away the textbooks and decides to teach the kids the basics of being civilized human beings, he finally starts making a connection.Poitier is magnificent here, creating a character of quiet dignity and unassuming intelligence with whom respect is immediately demanded, from the viewer as well as the rest of the characters in the movie. Poitier is one of those actors, like Meryl Streep, who never has to resort to scenery chewing in order to command the screen. If memory serves, there is only one scene where Thackeray actually raises his voice. This is a performance that, like a lot of Streep's work, should be studied by acting students...Poitier beautifully internalizes Thackeray's initial confusion on how to reach these students and the joy it brings him when it begins to happen.Christian Roberts and Judy Geeson offer effective support as Thackeray's biggest problem student and another student who develops a crush on him, but this is Poitier's show all the way and his performance is the film's number one appeal.

There are so many things in this movie that could only happen not only pre-9\/11, but pre-Lockerbie Bombing. Like how a passenger (Helen Hayes) managed to sneak aboard an international flight and it did not caused every federal agency to freak out. Or the captain leaving the flight deck during the flight. Or that the captain smoked a pipe... while flying. Or that George Kennedy is in this movie. I'm know he was a serious actor, but I will always remember him as the man foaming at the mouth in the Naked Gun 2 1\/2.But I was even more surprised how much intentional comedy there is in this movie. There is a scene when the plane is returning because something went horribly wrong (not much of a spoiler in the original disaster movie) and one of the passengers is freaking out screaming we're all gonna' die!. On the other side of the aisle is a priest in one fluid movement crosses himself and backhands the guy in the face.The drama is also pretty good as you see a three or so minor plots all pull together in one major disaster threatening to kill everyone on board this Boeing 707. As someone who watches that air disaster documentary I felt like it was a story done by someone who actually knew a thing or two about airlines. Actually Airport is apparently based off a book written with enough technical details worthy of Tom Clancy... and since Tom Clancy is my favorite author I might read it.There are some things like slightly stilted acting and some odd editing choices like when characters are talking via phone or radio they insert the person on the other end. It's not a bad idea, but I normally associate this kind of shot with sitcoms and feels out of place in a drama. It was better used in the middle of the movie when a woman disappears and they use the PA to alert security and as they make the announcement it shows security guards in different points in the airport all snapping to attention, I thought it was very effective there.Also points where I thought when the plane comes in for its inevitable emergency landing that I thought we needed more exterior shots or the people on the ground waiting for the plane, but I assume they just didn't have the budget since in 1970 they would have had to use practical effects. But that is also what I liked, everything was practical. Even seeing the obvious toy airplane gliding on a string through dry ice just made me smile.Airport is in summary a good movie. It has comedy, it has drama, it has romance, it has interesting cinematography, it has good actors, it has practical effects, and it has the charm of an old movie.

This film is well beloved by many (including myself), and I jumped at the opportunity to catch a screening at the o2 Cineworld as part of the Take 2 programme.The intro to this film is brilliant, as it shows how well the practical effects have aged (at least in comparison to the computer generated ones).

They play scientists that have been fired from their University, and decide to go into business for themselves by capturing and storing spooks, spectres and ghosts. These guys are so good at their roles, that it's definitely worth mentioning. I know that Peter Venkman was written for John Belushi, but I honestly cannot imagine anyone other that Bill Murray in the role; definitely a career defining role (same for Akroyd and Ramis). Rick Moranis is probably one of the funnier characters in the film (even if he is kind of a stereotype of sorts). Sigourney Weaver is also very good as the attractive Dana Barrett, who contacts the Ghostbusters after she encounters the supernatural. Her chemistry with Bill Murray is hilarious and some what charming at times.Ernie Hudson's had his moments throughout the film (including one of the best lines in the film), but I think that the character may have been slightly under utilised, but because the narrative flows very smoothly, I don't consider it too much of an issue. Another issue that I have is although some of the effects in the film have aged well, others such as the stop motion dog-creatures haven't; and sort of stand out like a sore thumb (though they are a testament to how far effects work has come over the years).Overall, my complaints are minimal and don't really mean anything; because this film is absolutely amazing!

No matter who you are, even if you haven't seen the film; you'll recognise the iconic logo, theme and quotes that have seeped their way into pop culture. This film is well beloved by many (including myself), and I jumped at the opportunity to catch a screening at the o2 Cineworld as part of the Take 2 programme.The intro to this film is brilliant, as it shows how well the practical effects have aged (at least in comparison to the computer generated ones). It also manages to perfectly set up the premise of the film without any dialogue. We are then introduced to Our three main characters played by Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd & Harold Ramis. They play scientists that have been fired from their University, and decide to go into business for themselves by capturing and storing spooks, spectres and ghosts. These guys are so good at their roles, that it's definitely worth mentioning. I know that Peter Venkman was written for John Belushi, but I honestly cannot imagine anyone other that Bill Murray in the role; definitely a career defining role (same for Akroyd and Ramis). Rick Moranis is probably one of the funnier characters in the film (even if he is kind of a stereotype of sorts). Sigourney Weaver is also very good as the attractive Dana Barrett, who contacts the Ghostbusters after she encounters the supernatural. Her chemistry with Bill Murray is hilarious and some what charming at times.Ernie Hudson's had his moments throughout the film (including one of the best lines in the film), but I think that the character may have been slightly under utilised, but because the narrative flows very smoothly, I don't consider it too much of an issue.

In his path he finds many difficulties and of course on of them is racism because he is an African American and the town is a racially hostile southern town. After some investigations that he makes he finds out some very interesting results but he has some problems with the local police chief of this town and things are getting more complicated.I really liked this movie because of the plot which I found very interesting with many swifts and in many times I found myself considering that one person in the killer and after some minutes I changed my opinion about it and I could not be sure for anything. I also liked the direction which made by Norman Jewison and it was very good. About the interpretations I have to say that I liked the interpretation of Rod Steiger who played as local police chief Gillespie (won the Oscar for the Best Actor in a Leading Role). Another interpretation that I have to mention is Sidney Poitier's who played as detective Virgil Tibbs and he was simply outstanding on it.To sum up I have to say that In the Heat of the Night is a very good movie and you should watch it because it represents a period of time with many racial issues as many other movies but with a very specific difference. This difference is that we have racial issues and racism even when an African American is considered the best on what he does. I strongly recommend it because it has much of suspense and I am sure that you will like it very much also because it combines very well the mystery behind a murder with many social problems of those times.

It has a ton of plot holes and none of the characters were all that likable. I usually like Kurt Russell's performances (he was quite good in The Thing, Executive Decision, and Tequila Sunrise) but I didn't really like his performance in EFNY. I thought he was trying too hard to talk and act like Clint Eastwood. But I decided to give Escape from L.A. a chance and I actually liked it quite a bit. And I kind of have gained a bit more respect for the original after watching EFLA. I think the original could have been like this if it had a larger budget. EFLA has basically the same story but its budget allowed it to be far more over the top. There definitely are plot holes in ESLA but I just didn't care.I really like how EFLA doesn't take itself seriously at all. There's this one scene where Snake Plissken surfs off a tsunami onto a car driven by this one guy played by Steve Buscemi. And Kurt Russell is far better here than in EFNY. You'd think a character who unhesitatingly sends the whole world back into the Dark Ages would be unlikable but Snake Plissken was actually a likable character.Some of the special effects are bad and the sets aren't the best. But the story just has a charm that is lacking in other films with far better visuals, like the insanely imbecilic 2009 Star Trek reboot (I really, really, really hate that movie). It's too bad Escape from Earth is probably not going to get made. I'd really like to see what happens to Snake after the events of this movie.
