The air combat scenes are by far the best of any jet fighter film. They are great because no shots were computer images! There was trick photography in some shots, like using models that shot missiles and the one scene where 'Maverick' and 'Goose' did the inverted dive and flipped-off the MiG pilot was made by splicing two pieces of film together.The aerial shots in Flight of the Intruder were great as well, but some shots, such as the night shots, were computer generated. Even the TV show JAG uses F-14 scenes from Top Gun and computer generates them. It may be more cost-efective to do that, but nothing beats filming the real thing.All in all, I can give nothing but props to the cinematogrophy and editing.

Despite the wonderful heartfelt performance by Richard Farnsworth, and some great cinematography, this film is just too slow for me.  I guess I could have anticipated that based on the fact that a lawn mower IS slow.  But a film doesn't have to move at break-neck pace to have something really important to say, and to say it well.  This movie didn't do either, I'm afraid.I did also appreciate the score by the Twin Peaks composer, and some scenes were very good-- the bundle of sticks, the low voices in the background (someone said it was a sound problem but I credit David Lynch for his realism-- were we far away from these people and that's how they would sound-- not up close like they were speaking into a microphone the way a normal movie would have you believe), the way the daughter's story is exposed, and so on.Overall I gave it a 6 out of 10-- I was disappointed and cannot recommend it to others.
