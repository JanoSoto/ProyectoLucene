[{"date":"18 May 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Rushmore directed by Wes Anderson (and co-written with his friend Owen Wilson) is a wonderfully executed tale that depicts both teen and adult angst, all the while offering clever touches that help categorize the film as a dark comedy. Named after the beloved school that Max Fischer (Schwartzman) attends, it involves a trio of characters that, without circumstantial incidents, probably would never have gotten together in the first place. Max is a student whose grades are so poor that his scholarship is in jeopardy; his academic career has been completely left behind for an enormous amount of extracurricular activities that Max both participates in and, in some cases, either founded or leads. When entrepreneur Herman Blume (Murray) comes to speak at Rushmore (his twin sons are students there) Max seeks him out and begins a dialogue, creating the beginnings of a strange but strong friendship. In Max, Herman sees someone with drive and spirit that he is lacking in his unsatisfying life, a life that is filled with wealth, but also with a philandering wife and two obnoxious sons, none of who care about him. Soon after, Max encounters a teacher from the elementary portion of Rushmore named Rosemary Cross (Williams) and he immediately falls in love with the young widow who treats Max like an equal (though with some bemusement) but seems to be cloaked in a large amount of sadness and loss. When Herman and Rosemary begin an affair, Max starts an all-out war with Herman, who retaliates, amounting in some pretty hilarious situations.For anyone who has seen another Wes Anderson film (Bottle Rocket, The Life Aquatic, The Royal Tennenbaums) the presentation of Rushmore won't be a surprise. Anderson obviously studied theater, as is evidenced by the blocking of the film, use of theater curtains that present a scene, the vivid colors, and, for the most part, a wardrobe that has so much character that they actually look like costumes. Other Anderson traits are present, such as the ever-present montage scene complete with punk music, brief underwater shots and precocious children. Max Fischer is an excellent character, richly written and portrayed wonderfully by Schwartzman, who makes his acting debut in this film, though you would never imagine that from his brilliant performance. Anderson has a knack for employing excellent actors who, despite their long respective filmographies, are able to take a role and (please forgive the expression that has now become overused by American Idol judges) make it their own in that you cannot imagine anyone else playing that part. Murray's character Herman is the epitome of this. It has been said that Murray read the script and was so taken with it that he offered to be in the movie for free; it is also one of the first times that Murray took on a role that didn't involve slapstick, simple humor or bodily noises, (though I did think he did a wonderful job as Bunny Breckenridge in Ed Wood) which led to a mid-life career of real respectability and (gasp) an Oscar nomination. Murray is now one of Wes Anderson's regular actors, and though I enjoyed him in Tennenbaums I think this was a slightly better role for him.Though Wes Anderson is one of my favorite film directors, I can understand how some don't like his films. However, I think that the reasons are pretty much identical to why I, in fact, appreciate his films with a lot of regard. I've heard the terms quirky (overused in my opinion) and weird used. To an audience encapsulated in the mainstream, this is absolutely not going to appeal to them. I've also heard the term depressing used, which is correct to a certain extent. While Rushmore has its comedic elements, (though it is mostly dark comedy) the underlying messages are quite sad; a man who has a crappy family, a woman who recently lost her husband and a young man who is having his entire world yanked out from under him. Anderson likes to address the high points of his characters' lives in a quick montage, or as an aside in the beginning of the film. What he does with the rest of the film is roll up his sleeves and dig into the difficult times that follow the highs of his characters, whether it is financial, personal or spiritually success. And that is what I like most about Anderson and the film Rushmore; underneath the stylish presentation lies a plausible, effective and emotional story that, coupled with his wonderful troupe of actors is simply exquisite. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 May 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Rushmore directed by Wes Anderson (and co-written with his friend Owen Wilson) is a wonderfully executed tale that depicts both teen and adult angst, all the while offering clever touches that help categorize the film as a dark comedy.
