Boys Don't Cry is a slow-motion train wreck of a movie that is watched with a deer-in-the-headlights sort of morbid fixation.  It's a work of art not meant to be enjoyed, but rather to be felt viscerally.  It's quite a good movie... but definitely not for the faint of heart.Director Kimberly Peirce deftly exposes the dark underbelly of small-town life, while simultaneously finding the humanity in even the most evil characters.  The villains here aren't faceless monsters, nor is the victim an innocent angel-- we see them all, for good or ill, as real people. Much of the production has an amateurish quality to it, however, with silly visual effects and melodramatic close-ups that detract from the mood. Peirce would have been wise to keep the sensationalism to a minimum and focus more on character development.  In the end, Boys Don't Cry is saved from mediocrity by the compelling tragedy of the story, and the strong performances of Hilary Swank, Chloe Sevigny, and Peter Sarsgaard.I recommend viewers watch the movie first and learn about the actual case second, as I did.  I was absolutely shocked by one of the events at the end of the movie, and the film had more of an impact on me than it would have if I'd known exactly what was going to happen.The real Teena Brandon has probably been lost forever in the dramatization of her\/his life and the subsequent political crossfire.  Both the left and the right seem to be caught up in discussing gay issues and tolerance. The tragedy of Teena Brandon is not one of intolerance (any guy who lies, steals, and seduces girls under false pretenses is not going to be tolerated.)

But after I heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at Cannes, I decided to give it a try.  What I got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot.  Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as &#145;nurse' Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience.  I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock.  The film bounces continuously between comedy, drama, romance, and thriller.  Yet despite this apparent identity crisis, it holds up quite well.  I found my eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end always waiting for the next twist in the story.  The entire cast is strong, if not spectacular. My only real complaint is that director Neil Labute (who made a splash a few years ago with the very impressive and dark &#145;In the Company of Men') relied much too heavily on many cliched Hollywood conventions.

Supposedly a remake of the William Castle classic, this movie takes the concept of that movie - five strangers trapped in a haunted house by a millionaire - and deviates so far from that flick that it has to be considered it's own movie. Creativity runs rampant in this script as it invokes themes of suspicion, paranoia, deceit, claustrophobia and psycho imagery wrapped in visions of sadism, depravity and mutilation. Much of it is nothing more than one big gore fest more than likely to offend true fans of the supernatural.

It's such a departure from his wasted talent on SNL. Bridgette Wilson doesn't get to really shine and Geoffrey Rush really invokes and pulls off a great Vincent Price take that falls close to the master's expert style of terror as he acts as host for this band of non-descripts and the movie watcher. Lisa Loeb (looking uncannily like Meighan Desmond, Discord of Hercules) has a temporary spot in the opening set-up, but she really needed to come to the house. As much as they changed the original script, her role could have been expanded. Chris Kattan emotes better talent here than any of his wasted roles on SNL evoking the atmosphere of another great haunted house classic, The Legend of Hell House. Bridgette Wilson is cast in a great role, but very quickly becomes a throwaway character and Famke Janssen broods and mulls her way through the movie as if she's looking more for a way out of the movie itself, and the other characters are only halfway interesting enough to make anyone care what happens to them. The special effects style of the ghosts is excellent and lends more than an eerie trait to the movie as a whole, but the movie falls apart at the end as the plot gets even more ridiculous and the situation even more far-fetched. Most of the effects aren't as scary as you would find in a genuine haunted house with a paranormal history, but they do illicit the same reactions as one might get from a carnival\/funland haunted house. While not everyone will be attracted to this movie, I think it has enough redeeming values to keep it from being a total disappointment. Personally, I recommend it to fans of intelligent horror, but the brain-dead fans who only care for splatter, gore and vomit won't appreciate it.

I might have been the only one in my school to have taken such a feat and I'd bet even money that no one else would have joined me for the simple matter of having something better to do. While much of the movie's production baffles me, it does have more of a coming of age style that a horror flick; compare this with Rob Reiner's Stand By Me and you know what I mean. The movie doesn't really explain what happens to the three would-be film-makers, but such a point isn't important as long as the film hits it's mark and it sure did with me. when I saw the Sci-Fi's channel's documentary-style promo for the movie, I was already interested enough in the paranormal and freaked out enough to think this movie was true, but a lot of logical thinking and lateral research to look into the case set me straight. I don't understand the people condemning this movie who criticize it for not being scary. They just prove to me just how conditioned we are as a society to violence.

Yes, a pile of rocks is not very scary if you happen to be the one who put it there, but if you and two others are the only ones for miles and you keep coming across evidence that an unseen fourth person is leaving tell tale signs of their presence, then you may be a little unnerved. Again, it's the presence of what you don't know that scares you; not the presence of what you do know. What heightens the fear factory is the suggestion the movie originally intended by filming it as if it was a true story; the aspect that this movie was based on true incidents sure had me curious, but of course we all know now that that was the filmmaker's intent. The only things I find wrong with this movie are the slip-shod editing, the shaking cameras, the swearing and the endless droning on of some of the duologue, but in its execution, The Blair Witch Project really is one of the scariest films out there for serious horror fans and it will certainly go down as a milestone in true horror entertainment in the same way as Psycho and Night of The Living Dead !

Frankly I think the little P.O.V. shot of the package near the beginning of the movie was one of the most annoying shots that I've seen in a long time.  Just what did that accomplish that a simple closeup of the package wouldn't have.  Follow the package in extreme CU if you must, but please, a package, nor the hand of the delivery man, has eyes for us to see through!  Unless for some reason there was supposed to be a camera strapped to the package.Granted, there is some nice cinematography in the film as well, but it is overshadowed by the sheer lack of any real coherent storyline.  Someone else said it best - Tom Hanks gets stranded and suddenly he's a man without a brain.  FOUR YEARS???  It didn't cross his mind to build a boat before then? I hope I don't get stuck on an island with Chuck Noland, thank you.  Why all the silly gaps in time?  The film would have been much more interesting had we actually seen what he went through in order to survive for that long. (hmmm, think the screenwriter couldn't come up with much for him to do over the course of four years, and if he built a raft right away then the movie would be cut in half... so hey, just put in a long passage of time with a title card and everything is solved?)It pains me to see a film like this getting so much praise.  Yes, it has been a bad year for movies, but there were some good ones too.  High Fidelity, Gladiator... heck, even Mission Impossible II was a better made film than Cast Away.  Here's hoping 2001 is better, so maybe audiences will start expecting a little more from their movies.

And so it is that `The Return Of The Pink Panther' is entrusted to none other than the inimitable Inspector (Peter Sellers) from France, much to the chagrin of Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), who, knowing what unbridled mayhem Clouseau is really capable of, would like nothing more than to be rid of him once and for all.  But such a request from the sovereign authorities of a friendly nation cannot be denied, and Clouseau is therefore dispatched with all haste to Lugash, with orders to bring the criminals to justice, and insure that the case is indeed-- to quote Clouseau-- `solv-ed.' \tSome ten years had passed since director Blake Edwards and Sellers had teamed up for the brilliant film `A Shot In The Dark,' before coming together once again for this third installment chronicling the misadventures of the `belov-ed' Inspector Clouseau.

Characters returning after debuting in `A Shot In The Dark' include the terrific Lom, whose Chief Inspector Dreyfus is the perfect foil for Clouseau; Andre Maranne (Francois); and of course Burt Kwouk as Clouseau's ever-attacking manservant, Cato.  The scenes between Sellers and Kwouk, in which they spar at Clouseau's house, are a riot, as is the way Sellers and Lom play off of one another throughout the film (or the series, for that matter); Lom's `reactions' alone to what Sellers is doing are classic bits of comedy. \tRounding out the supporting cast are Peter Arne (Colonel Sharky), Peter Jeffrey (General Wadafi), Gregoire Aslan (Chief of Lugash Police), Victor Spinetti (Hotel Concierge) and John Bluthal (Blind Beggar).  A number of elements go into making a comedy work, and `The Return Of The Pink Panther' has them all, but most especially, Peter Sellers, who without a doubt is one of the funniest actors ever to grace the silver screen.  His comedy works because he always plays it straight and allows the humor to flow naturally from the situation at hand; there's never a laugh that is forced or false.  Consider one of the opening scenes in which Clouseau, walking a beat, questions a blind beggar with a monkey about having the proper permits to beg, all while the bank in front of which they are standing is being robbed.  There's a purity about it that makes it a joy to watch; the kind of film you can see over and over again and never get tired of.  One of the great things about video and DVD is that it affords us the opportunity of cuing up this film-- as well as the other `Panther' movies-- at will.

Now, I liked the Brady Bunch movie because it was a parody of a really bad TV show.  Lost In Space, for all its many, many flaws, was also better than the TV show it was based on.  Mission Impossible wasn't a great film, but it did work as an action movie.  Star Trek and Naked Gun had the advantage of just being continuations of shows that were unfairly cancelled.  Charlie's Angels was also a parody, and it was very entertaining.  Those are the only TV show-movies worth mentioning.  Wild Wild West might be a parody, but it travels so far from its source material, that any resemblance is lost on an audience that probably never saw the show anyways.  This movie certainly won't create any new fans of the show.  Come to think of it, I seriously doubt anyone involved in the production of Wild Wild West the movie ever saw the show either. Wild Wild West is an awkward, odd, and pointless movie.  It does not rise to the level of badness occupied by the movie Batman and Robin, but it seems like it's trying to.  I won't bore you with the exact details about the plot.  This movie is pure formula smart-alec cop #1 (in this case they're federal agents) meets more serious cop #2, they don't get along but their forced to work together to find the bad guy they're both chasing.  And a girl gets involved.  Unoriginality is not an unforgivable sin in a movie.  If it were, then James Bond would be out of a job.  This movie fails because it's just really awkward.  It degenerates into race and handicap jokes that no self-respecting person would laugh at, and keeps bouncing back and forth between wanting to be serious and wanting to be funny.  (Contrast the carnage of one of the scenes involving the villain's super-tank with the goofiness of the preceding and following scenes.)The suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy action movies is stretched beyond the audience's ability to rationalize.  It suffers from Reed Richards' Syndrome (named after the master-inventor leader of Marvel Comics' Fantastic Four, who has built everything from time machines to faster-than-light space ships).  The weird inventions in this movie are both (a) impossible and (b) revolutionary.  If people really had these gadgets then the world would be revolutionized by them.  A flying machine in 1869?  Gordon's rocket-cycle?  (Let's not talk about the giant spider!)  I know this movie is NOT SUPPOSED TO BE historically accurate, but COME ON!  This movie makes Gladiator look like a History Channel documentary.I really feel sorry for anyone who paid to see this movie.  And the next time you go to see a movie based on an old TV show, make sure it's free.

Now, I liked the Brady Bunch movie because it was a parody of a really bad TV show.  Lost In Space, for all its many, many flaws, was also better than the TV show it was based on.

Wild Wild West might be a parody, but it travels so far from its source material, that any resemblance is lost on an audience that probably never saw the show anyways.
