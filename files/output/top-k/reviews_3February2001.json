I've watched it in its entirety more than once since then.  It's difficult not to conclude that the master director's age was beginning to take its toll by 1966.  It could have been a great film except for some major flaws.First, the main characters.  Newman and Andrews look distinctly ill-at-ease and their acting is wooden.  There is very nearly no chemistry between them, and viewers are not really drawn into their somewhat implausible situation.  Both actors are compelling in other films, but for some reason not in this one.Second, Hitchcock would have done better to keep his villains' identity less specific.  In The Lady Vanishes, The Thirty-nine Steps, and North by Northwest, the identity of the foreign agents is left deliberately vague and thus little plausibility need be attached to their actions.  Here they are East German communists, of which we know rather a lot.Third, there are inconsistencies in the plot.  At one point Newman and Andrews are forced to go out into an open space to avoid being overheard.

Everyone knows, of course, that Hitch's longtime musical collaborator, Bernard Herrmann, wrote a mostly complete score for the film, but the two had a falling out on the set and Herrmann was dismissed.

Some time after taking the post, Wakefield (played by Michael Douglas) discovers that his own daughter, Caroline (played by Erika Christensen) is a heroin addict. Sub-plots involve the various cartels and authorities in Mexico, a high-ranking middle-class dealer in San Diego, and Mexican policeman Javier Rodriguez (played by Benicio Del Toro in an award-winning performance) who tries to do the right thing when there is no right answer.Traffic examines America's war on drugs in a thought provoking way. Extensively researched (and based to some extent on Channel Four's drug documentaries), it combines big name acting and the scope of a major movie whilst retaining many of the techniques of independent film-making - and much of its integrity.The crux of the film is the uselessness of the war against drugs, but it manages to make the point without making a sermon. This is both the film's strength and weakness by not resorting to big speeches, larger than life characters or pulling the multi-layered plots together into a single, overpoweringly neat crescendo, Traffic convinces by osmosis, by displaying the facts and letting the audience make up its own mind. But in doing so its entertainment value is necessarily lessened, some of the characters and dialogue are underdeveloped, and it tip-toes around its conclusion (apparently that current policies simply do not, and cannot, work) with an emotionally bleak lack of commitment to any message (such as decriminalization, factual and better researched educational efforts, more treatment programs or treatment in, or instead of, prison). It never declaims its message with anger or wry bitterness but leaves the audience to find its own anger at the situation depicted. Although the subject matter has a constant note of urgency, the pace of the movie is somewhat splintered and our enjoyment is therefore largely dependent on how interesting we find the real-life dilemmas as portrayed in the film.In evaluating a film we could look at a film's value as cinema in isolation (in which case the Director's previous effort, Erin Brockovitch, for instance, is more entertaining), or look at a film because of its value outside of itself, because it makes a valuable point. Alternatively we could judge a film as good film-making because it effectively serves a purpose beyond that of cinema, because it not only makes a point but has an effect. If Traffic makes that sort of impact, if it becomes a wake-up call on drugs policy, then it may be some time after the initial release that such an impact can be judged.The war on drugs has been described as the most unexamined conflict of our time. So is Traffic examining the conflict in a way that could influence it?The logic of the film suggests that the drug war benefits few of the people it is intended to benefit, keeps the drug cartels' businesses successful, disadvantages minorities, and generally throws money at the problem rather than analyzing it or implementing policy on the basis (for instance) of achieving the greatest good for the greatest number. The budget of the South American drug cartels is estimated at 200 billion dollars a year, whereas the budget expended fighting those cartels is estimated at between19 and 45 billion dollars. This means the cartels can afford the best in ensuring the drugs reach their destination and any laws are sidestepped.Laws may affect prices - not necessarily making them higher (low cost increases addiction rates) but they do not stop drugs. The stories in the movie, many of them based on real life, generally demonstrate with unnerving force that the war on drugs cannot be won, that governments refuse to admit it can't be won, that well-meaning people risk their lives trying to win it and that policy-makers are doomed and willing to repeat the same mistakes year after year.According to official figures, approximately five million people in the U.S. are addicted to drugs, only 2.1 million receive treatment, and 52,000 deaths a year are directly attributed to illegal drugs. It can be argued that the drugs war probably takes a greater toll on human lives than do the drugs.According to Michael Douglas, listening to comments at screenings, both the Drugs Enforcement Agency and U.S. Customs praised the film, believing it shows how hard their job is.The film goes into some detail about how drugs are marketed and how laws are neatly avoided, watching in documentary-epic style rather than judging. The audience hypothesizes that people are denied services because of the drain on the economy occasioned by uselessly fighting a drugs war, not to mention the crossfire of associated crime. Most education efforts are still blinkered by well-meaning lies and hypocrisy and, at a time when several states in America are going for legislation to allow non-violent drug offenders to choose treatment instead of jail, Traffic tries and succeeds in countering most of the arguments for the continuation of the drugs war.Under the pseudonym Peter Andrews, Director Steven Soderbergh also does the filming. Various cinematic techniques support the complex interwoven and parallel stories across the Mexican border the film is grainy and light-blasted, with frequent hand-held camera work - the Washington and inner city lighting is equally key-signatured, though less obviously. Young Christensen's drug experience as she uses crack cocaine is emphasized as the camera goes out of focus yet, like the hand-held camera, it seems appropriate rather than pretentious or ostentatious (compare this to the other anti-drugs movie released at about the same time, Requiem for a Dream, where the fancy edits are central rather than supportive.)Del Toro's performance as a Mexican policeman, Javier Rodriguez - perhaps the film's most enduring character - puts him on the map as an actor of outstanding ability.  His sunken eyes and weary countenance contain a smouldering intensity that almost suggests a Puerto-Rican Humphrey Bogart. His moral disillusionment only adds to our awareness that there is no real solution or right answer, yet his discernment is in striking contrast to the general headless and ignorant policies of the American authorities on the one hand, or the calm self-assurance of the cartels who know how easily they can outflank those authorities on the other. Rodriguez wants to believe, even in the confusing morass of double-dealing, that fair play, honour and integrity are nevertheless possible. His granite-like moral judgement is the film's most warming theme. But, like many of the characters, what he does will make little difference under the present regimes.Zeta-Jones, pregnant throughout filming, brings conviction to her part and more acting ability than I've seen in any of her previous roles. The rest of the cast all handle themselves well without hogging stage centre. The overall result, under Soderbergh's skillful direction, is an awesome movie.Soderbergh keeps us guessing what he will do next - after Sex Lies and Videotape, Out of Sight, and Erin Brockovitch, Traffic is his most ambitious and complex film to date. Soderbergh does not, himself, favour legalizing drugs, but believes addiction is a public health issue rather than a crime. The film also tends to the view that rational rather than emotive policy would bring down the crime rate and result in a safer society. Soderbergh is a well-respected director and his name somehow brings a confidence to a narrative - one commentator remarked how it was a good job he did this film before it was tackled by someone else . . . like Oliver Stone . ..Time will tell how important a landmark Traffic is. Cinematically it is a powerful and mature work that will spark off different thoughts in different viewers. It just about avoids falling between the two stools of thriller and documentary and, although its greatest weakness, this is perhaps also its most defining strength.

But in doing so its entertainment value is necessarily lessened, some of the characters and dialogue are underdeveloped, and it tip-toes around its conclusion (apparently that current policies simply do not, and cannot, work) with an emotionally bleak lack of commitment to any message (such as decriminalization, factual and better researched educational efforts, more treatment programs or treatment in, or instead of, prison). It never declaims its message with anger or wry bitterness but leaves the audience to find its own anger at the situation depicted. Although the subject matter has a constant note of urgency, the pace of the movie is somewhat splintered and our enjoyment is therefore largely dependent on how interesting we find the real-life dilemmas as portrayed in the film.In evaluating a film we could look at a film's value as cinema in isolation (in which case the Director's previous effort, Erin Brockovitch, for instance, is more entertaining), or look at a film because of its value outside of itself, because it makes a valuable point. Alternatively we could judge a film as good film-making because it effectively serves a purpose beyond that of cinema, because it not only makes a point but has an effect. If Traffic makes that sort of impact, if it becomes a wake-up call on drugs policy, then it may be some time after the initial release that such an impact can be judged.The war on drugs has been described as the most unexamined conflict of our time. So is Traffic examining the conflict in a way that could influence it?The logic of the film suggests that the drug war benefits few of the people it is intended to benefit, keeps the drug cartels' businesses successful, disadvantages minorities, and generally throws money at the problem rather than analyzing it or implementing policy on the basis (for instance) of achieving the greatest good for the greatest number. The budget of the South American drug cartels is estimated at 200 billion dollars a year, whereas the budget expended fighting those cartels is estimated at between19 and 45 billion dollars. This means the cartels can afford the best in ensuring the drugs reach their destination and any laws are sidestepped.Laws may affect prices - not necessarily making them higher (low cost increases addiction rates) but they do not stop drugs. The stories in the movie, many of them based on real life, generally demonstrate with unnerving force that the war on drugs cannot be won, that governments refuse to admit it can't be won, that well-meaning people risk their lives trying to win it and that policy-makers are doomed and willing to repeat the same mistakes year after year.According to official figures, approximately five million people in the U.S. are addicted to drugs, only 2.1 million receive treatment, and 52,000 deaths a year are directly attributed to illegal drugs. It can be argued that the drugs war probably takes a greater toll on human lives than do the drugs.According to Michael Douglas, listening to comments at screenings, both the Drugs Enforcement Agency and U.S. Customs praised the film, believing it shows how hard their job is.The film goes into some detail about how drugs are marketed and how laws are neatly avoided, watching in documentary-epic style rather than judging. The audience hypothesizes that people are denied services because of the drain on the economy occasioned by uselessly fighting a drugs war, not to mention the crossfire of associated crime. Most education efforts are still blinkered by well-meaning lies and hypocrisy and, at a time when several states in America are going for legislation to allow non-violent drug offenders to choose treatment instead of jail, Traffic tries and succeeds in countering most of the arguments for the continuation of the drugs war.Under the pseudonym Peter Andrews, Director Steven Soderbergh also does the filming. Various cinematic techniques support the complex interwoven and parallel stories across the Mexican border the film is grainy and light-blasted, with frequent hand-held camera work - the Washington and inner city lighting is equally key-signatured, though less obviously. Young Christensen's drug experience as she uses crack cocaine is emphasized as the camera goes out of focus yet, like the hand-held camera, it seems appropriate rather than pretentious or ostentatious (compare this to the other anti-drugs movie released at about the same time, Requiem for a Dream, where the fancy edits are central rather than supportive.)Del Toro's performance as a Mexican policeman, Javier Rodriguez - perhaps the film's most enduring character - puts him on the map as an actor of outstanding ability.  His sunken eyes and weary countenance contain a smouldering intensity that almost suggests a Puerto-Rican Humphrey Bogart. His moral disillusionment only adds to our awareness that there is no real solution or right answer, yet his discernment is in striking contrast to the general headless and ignorant policies of the American authorities on the one hand, or the calm self-assurance of the cartels who know how easily they can outflank those authorities on the other. Rodriguez wants to believe, even in the confusing morass of double-dealing, that fair play, honour and integrity are nevertheless possible. His granite-like moral judgement is the film's most warming theme. But, like many of the characters, what he does will make little difference under the present regimes.Zeta-Jones, pregnant throughout filming, brings conviction to her part and more acting ability than I've seen in any of her previous roles. The rest of the cast all handle themselves well without hogging stage centre. The overall result, under Soderbergh's skillful direction, is an awesome movie.Soderbergh keeps us guessing what he will do next - after Sex Lies and Videotape, Out of Sight, and Erin Brockovitch, Traffic is his most ambitious and complex film to date. Soderbergh does not, himself, favour legalizing drugs, but believes addiction is a public health issue rather than a crime. The film also tends to the view that rational rather than emotive policy would bring down the crime rate and result in a safer society. Soderbergh is a well-respected director and his name somehow brings a confidence to a narrative - one commentator remarked how it was a good job he did this film before it was tackled by someone else . . . like Oliver Stone . ..Time will tell how important a landmark Traffic is.

Some time after taking the post, Wakefield (played by Michael Douglas) discovers that his own daughter, Caroline (played by Erika Christensen) is a heroin addict.

I however have a couple of problems with the film.SPOILERSAs I complained in my review of Aparajito, when tragedies arise in this series, they tend to repeat themselves. I was most affected by the first two of these major tragedies. The third one, at the beginning of Aparajito, affected me a lot, although its power was diminished. By the fourth one, I knew it was coming from miles away, and I felt unaffected. Now the major tragedy in this film seems a bit contrived. I think the development between Apu and his wife was incredibly powerful. The situation which led them to be married lends to a lot of interesting options. The option that was chosen, to kill his wife off, was definitely the wrong one. I am actually hypothesizing that the novel had some more episodes, or at least some more fleshed-out episodes, than does the final film. The events of The World of Apu, at least after the tragedy, seem crammed into a short period of time. It never feels like five years have passed. Still, this is a great movie. Though I stick by these complaints, the film as it stands is very worth watching, since, once you have watched Pather Panchali, one of the very best films ever made, you cannot help but watch Aparajito and The World of Apu.

I've been married to my wife from Taiwan for over four years now, and I've picked up Mandarin.  I love Chinese culture, Chinese people, and Asian history tremendously -- however, I've never been a fan of kung fu movies.  Why?  Because most of them do great injustice in their presentation of the art of Kung Fu -- they over-stylize it, they become pop pieces of phony action sound effects, vomit-inducing camera movements, and shotgun editing.  And the stories -- sweet Buddha -- such tremendous wealth of incredible Chinese literature available, all but unknown to the West -- trivialized by bad acting, bad writing, quick-buck-turning productions. Some of Jet Li's Wong Fei Hong films are considerably good, and the kung fu can't be beat, but the stories are still slaughtered -- the characters (especially the female characters) are excruciatingly stereotypical.After viewing Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I came close to weeping for joy.  This is what Chinese fantasy films should aspire to. This is the film that Chinese literature has been dying for -- a very true-to-source adaptation of an excellent Chinese novel, incredibly acted and reconstructed.  The mood is subdued throughout, not wontonly hyper. The fight scenes are, for the most part, scrolling and steady, showing stealth and true physically acute movements -- not a rampant collage of quick cuts, zoom ins, and the same two swooshing and contact sound effects over and over.I could go on with Ang Lee's genius, but I'll just recommend the films Pushing Hands and The Wedding Banquet as his other less-known masterpieces.The story is an excellent example of traditional Chinese fiction, full of personal dilemma, altruistic heroes with deeply embedded values (Where has altruism gone in American heroes?), and more non-verbal than spoken communication between characters.  The concept of great personal loss is hardly something you see in American literature and film -- suffering can never be near as great as the forced good-feeling ending.  Loss is an eternal theme in Chinese fiction -- one must lose to gain deeper love and appreciation.Some people have criticized the dialog -- well, no matter how well a language is translated in the subtitles, there are always inflections, hidden meanings, cultural references, and idioms that subtitles cannot communicate fully -- some that cannot be translated at all without deeper explanations.  (Imagine a Chinese person trying to watch Wayne's World or Good Morning, Vietnam in Chinese subtitles -- how the hell do you translate THAT?)  Plus, subtitles have to trim expressions down to the basest level to have enough screen-time to be read.  Unless you are fluent in Chinese, do not criticize this movie for its dialog -- which the subtitles do a fair job of translating.See this movie -- on the big screen if you can.  For those unfamiliar with Asian fiction, it's an extremely moving introduction to true Kung Fu ethics of ancient times and traditional story-telling style of the best of Chinese fantasy.  Keep one thing in mind, though -- most of the gravity-defying physical feats portrayed ARE meant to be fantasy -- they're representations of mythical feats of great Kung Fu secrets and mastery, enabling one to be superhuman.

If you are reading them to determine whether or not to see the movie, don't.  But I feel that most people read these reviews to validate their own feelings about a movie they have seen.Somehow, I escaped most of the hype for this movie and knew very little about it before I rented it (I do this semi-consciously so that my enjoyment of my first viewing is not spoiled).  Those reviewers that have said that the introductory stories have nothing to do with the picture, the frogs came out of nowhere, the characters' actions were without cause, and on and on and on, clearly did not get this movie.  I did.  In retrospect, I think the theme of the movie is too little, too late.  All of the characters experience a loss, of which most could have been prevented if they had the courage to face their fears and short-comings in time for others to care.  Believe it or not, I would have liked Magnolia to have been a little longer.  I did not have a full understanding of how the Tom Cruise character became an Andrew Dice Clay style preacher, or why the drug-abusing wife was so self-turmoiled.I think what I liked most, as I have liked in many other movies of the recent past, is the complete abandon that many mainstream movies are willing to proceed with.  This was almost non-existent in the 80's, a little light peeked through in the early 90's, and we are seeing more of in the past few years.  The era we are currently seeing reminds me of 70's movies with promising directors, a blend of experienced acting talent with fresh, young talent, and a boldness of material.  I even see it in movies that I don't like (Fight Club).  Magnolia would have never seen a reel of film in the 80's.  Neither would Fargo, Pulp fiction, The Thin Red Line, Run Lola Run, or American Beauty.

Those reviewers that have said that the introductory stories have nothing to do with the picture, the frogs came out of nowhere, the characters' actions were without cause, and on and on and on, clearly did not get this movie.

Believe it or not, I would have liked Magnolia to have been a little longer.  I did not have a full understanding of how the Tom Cruise character became an Andrew Dice Clay style preacher, or why the drug-abusing wife was so self-turmoiled.I think what I liked most, as I have liked in many other movies of the recent past, is the complete abandon that many mainstream movies are willing to proceed with.  This was almost non-existent in the 80's, a little light peeked through in the early 90's, and we are seeing more of in the past few years.  The era we are currently seeing reminds me of 70's movies with promising directors, a blend of experienced acting talent with fresh, young talent, and a boldness of material.  I even see it in movies that I don't like (Fight Club).  Magnolia would have never seen a reel of film in the 80's.  Neither would Fargo, Pulp fiction, The Thin Red Line, Run Lola Run, or American Beauty.

OK, forget about the plot, and enjoy the warmth of the movie. Isn't it great to see the best Spanish actors in one cast? Only Almodovar can attract them with his crazy ideas.What comes to the viewers' mind after first minutes of the movie? My answer red and yellow pattern..The pattern of Almodovar's life, it is not von Trier with his vague colors, it is not Spielberg with his flashy colors. This visual color effect puts viewers into the atmosphere of the film from first seconds.There's lots of intersecting stories in the plot of the movie. We see a fading actress fighting for her love, we see a story of a mother suffering a loss of her son, we see the underworld story of transvestites, a story of drug addicts, the story of dying HIV-victim...Isn't it what is going around us in day-to-day life, but we do not pay attention to it???The master, Almodovar, shows another side of life to us, and his cast is a great support for that. Personally, I discovered to myself that Penelope Cruz is not just another Spanish beauty, but is a very talented actress. This movie was a really good start for her career, just look at how much she is filmed these days in Hollywood.Being a big Almodovar fun, I should say that this movie has overcome my previous favourite of this director Women on the verge of the nervous breakdown. I highly recommend Todo sobre mi madre to all people who come to movies to see a piece of art, and not another one-day nonsence with Schwarzenegger. I liked it a lot, and..yes, I even cried, because this movie is so sincere and touching, that you can hardly surpress your emotions.If you decided to see this movie after reading this message, please reply to my mail and tell me if you agree with my opinion.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"3 February 2001","score":"","review":"  With the release of `The World is Not Enough,' the James Bond series approaches 40 years of existence.  No one disputes that the series' glory days are over-they have been since the late 1960s.  But the series continues to thrive--we are told that only Bond films are guaranteed to make money world wide. But the question remains, what is the future of the series?  The chase scenes in the Bond films have been surpassed by other movies.  The special effects are good, yet not Matrix-class.  And the insistence on keeping the films' sex tame has made that aspect almost quaint today.Well, if `The World is Not Enough' is the future of Bond films--it's a healthy one. There are several reasons for this1. The film has a good director, Michael Apted, who has done `Coal Miner's Daughter' and other critically blessed movies.  Recent Bond films have seemed like a series of unconnected chase scenes.  In `World,' Apted remains a consistent pace.  2. The plot is easily followed and not as far-fetched as some have been in the past.  Bond films usually feature a villain out to take over the world.  Bond's foe here is Renard (Robert Caryle), who wants to capture the oil delivery mechanism from the former Soviet Union to the West.  Important-yet not apocalyptic. 3. `World' has a wonderful cast.  Caryle (even though he is made up to look like Fester Addams) is one of best developed Bond bad guys ever. He is ruthless, but we almost feel sorry for him because he can no longer feel pain (something his lover taunts him about), and is dying.  Sophie Marceau is both beautiful and  talented as one of Bond's love interests.  Robbie Coltrane and Judi Dench are back, as is Desmond Llewelyn as `Q' (although there is poignancy in Llewelyn's departure in the movie-he died after the filming), but he will be replaced adequately by John Cleese. 4. Pierce Brosnan.  No one can ever replace the best Bond, Sean Connery, but Brosnan is a strong number two.  He is athletic enough to convince us (unlike Roger Moore) that he could escape death on a regular basis. And notice how business-like he is.  Sure he has time to bed a few beauties and to crack a few puns, but he seems focused on getting his job done.Where to improve the series?  First, the producers need to stop using starlets (Denise Richards, in this case) who can't act as Bond girls.  Marceau shows there are some beautiful, talented women out there.  Second, stop the double entendres.  They're not funny any more.  The last pun in this film is a real groaner. Other than that, the future is bright, Mr. Bond.
