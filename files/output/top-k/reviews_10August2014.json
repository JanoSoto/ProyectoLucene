These siblings always know how to enthrall both the mind and the heart. With such a brilliant concept, spectacular and innovative action sequences, and a gripping story, they keep you hooked and in awe throughout the movie. The characters, the dialogues and the scenes have become legendary now. No matter how many times you watch it, it thrills you every single time.The movie can be seen as a stand-alone one or the first part of the trilogy; no matter how you watch it, it's simply brilliant. It is a metaphor and allegory for so many things. Mainly, it tries to tell how our urban lives are so commercialized and media-driven that we're almost blinded by it. The film blurs the lines between fate and reality; ultimately, it depends on us as to how we take our life forward. A life of ignorance or a life based on knowledge - though happiness\/satisfaction is possible either way, only one of them can keep a particular person happy; sometimes, it's our choice what we choose to go forward with, and we should have the strength to go forward with the choice we've made.An average living-day-to-day guy waking up one day to find himself to be different, important, and many people depending on him - Who hasn't had that dream? This would be one of the most full-fledged and elaborate execution of that fantasy.Bill Pope's cinematography and Zach Staenberg's editing make the action sequences seem out of this world (pun intended); it takes you to a completely different level of cinematic action. I remember, when I first saw the movie (back in 2000 or something), I was completely blown away.Keanu Reeves is perfect for the role of Neo, and he slides in perfectly into the character of the young naive programmer trying to understand and grasp the limits (or should I say, no limits) of the new reality presented before him. Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne, and Hugo Weaving perform commendably, and form outstanding and memorable supporting characters of Trinity, Morpheus and Agent Smith respectively. Each one of them has their own unique part to play.From the prophecy of 'The One' to self doubt, there are many Christian references in the film, and there are influences from other religions as well. Influence doesn't matter, as long as it leads to the creation of something unique and exceptional. Japanese anime and Asian martial arts films had great influence on the Wachowski Siblings, but it was Mamoru Oshii's 1995 animated film 'Ghost in the Shell' that pushed them to delve into the cyberpunk genre.

It's become so iconic and immersed in pop culture that it's sometimes hard to just focus and enjoy the movie itself and not see it as a part of a huge phenomenon.All it's status and fan base aside, I try to do just that when I watch it and still enjoy it for what it is. For all it's imagination, the plot is nice and simple, basically a good guys VS bad guys western in space, leaving you to not think too hard about anything but just enjoy the many weird and wonderful locations and the characters.Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is a farm boy who wants to leave his home and fight the dark imperial forces led by the sinister Darth Vader, and it isn't long before he's thrust into an adventure after he meets the ageing Obi Won Kenobi (Alec Guiness). Hamill does fine as Skywalker but he is outshone by the much more interesting Guiness, and Harrison Ford, in one of his earliest roles as cocky pilot Han Solo, who finds himself reluctantly embroiled in their mission. Ford not only gets to play the most likable character but he has the confidence and screen charisma to be much more memorable than the protagonist.Even so, all the other characters are great too. The droids R2-D2, and C3P0, Han Solo's hairy sidekick - the Wookie, Chewbacca, and the feisty Princess Leia, (Carrie Fisher) who doesn't fit into the typical Hollywood damsel in distress category at the time.Some of the dialogue may now seem a bit corny, and some of the acting mediocre but it doesn't matter because there's a light, campy tone to the movie anyway, so it doesn't ruin the enjoyment. In fact adds to it for me.Lucas' genius was mixing Samurai and western elements with Sci-fi and using what he had with the budget to create a bizarre and memorable universe. Seen now, compared to the pace of modern Sci-fi movies, the movie's first half actually moves along quite slow, which is no bad thing in my view. It allows you to be pulled into it's world, and he cleverly uses the droid characters to take you on the journey, from the opening sequence right until the end. A revolutionary idea for the time. But then there's so many things about Star Wars that's revolutionary.Lucas has since tinkered about with the original trilogy and has ruined the franchise for many not only by doing this but with his prequel trilogy too. In some ways I agree but it doesn't take anything away from what he achieved with this in 1977. A movie that opened up audiences' imaginations and still holds up as not just as an influential classic but an entertaining fantasy adventure in it's own right.

Based on a highly popular manga series and directed by said manga's original writer Katsuhiro Ohtomo, it's a film that helped popularize anime culture in the West. It was nothing like we had seen before, being aimed solely at the adults, containing graphic sexual references, disturbing and gory images, heavy themes and more violence than any two Hollywood action blockbusters put together. It's also a thoughtful story and analogy about a young man forced to grow up too quickly and being confronted with strange phenomena, feelings and powers he's not yet mature enough to understand, let alone control.So what's the story? Kaneda is young hooligan belonging to a motorcycle gang. They're enjoying their freedom and mischief, until one day his friend and fellow gang member Tetsuo happens upon a small child, who's much more than he seems. Tetsuo gets injured and happens to absorb some of the child's power. From there the eponymous Akira seizes control and lures Tetsuo into trying to free him. And from there it's a nonstop battle for the survival of Neo-Tokyo, Tetsuo's soul and everyone's lives. All told through phenomenal voice acting, alluring twists, great plot points and animation so vivid, gorgeous, detailed and vibrant that people have made completely valid arguments for this being the crowning achievement of animation.Furthermore, the score is very good. It's not what you would expect from a movie such as this, being more groovy and ethnic than the normal pop and electric tunes, but it fits. You're always a bit surprised by it, but after a few moments you'll start digging it.Akira is a masterpiece. If you can, do read the manga series beforehand, because it's well worth it and offers a deeper understanding of the material. But, if you can't, this movie will still win you over with its brazen style, high impact concepts, beauty and sheer energy.

Yep, the inevitable sequel to the original hit and to be fair, I have no qualms about it. The first film was a breathe of fresh air and managed to capture the fun spirit of old fashioned adventures with a charming hero perfectly.This film did well upon release but got bad reviews, I don't really see why to be honest. Sure the plot is a bit textbook, daft and over used, but the whole idea of the Aussie bushman still trying to find his way around the modern big city of New York with its cultural differences, lingo difficulties and his general ignorance of anything outside of the outback is still just about amusing.Can't deny that there are moments when your thinking surely he's heard of that before! or seen one of those!. When Mick fails to pick up on a Richard Nixon impression and then admits he's never heard of Nixon...yeah OK you've been living in the wilds of Oz but SURELY you've heard of Nixon! come on!.The main let down for this film is the stupid ass plot. Its basically your standard baddies kidnap Dundee's girl and he's gotta save her. This incorporates much silly nonsense involving kiddie street gangs dressed in awful 80's 'gangwear' helping Dundee out, its lame.The second half of the plot (two halves just like the first film) sees Dundee and Jane...I mean 'Sue Charlton' back in native Oz hiding out from the bad guys who are now after them for revenge. All that way just for revenge? is it that important?. Anyway we are then given an overly long series of chase\/hunt sequences where Dundee uses his bushman talents to defeat the bad guys one by one.Kinda got the impression that the despite the fact the first film was a big success it didn't involve any violence or bad guys for Dundee to kill, and this is why we have this bog standard sequel storyline. First film was a nice romantic Prince Charming type story, this is Hollywood action time...Aussie style. What's even more off putting is both Dundee and Sue are in mortal danger during this time from the drug dealers hunting them yet they treat it like some kind of happy camping trip with lots of hugs n kisses. The director can't decide what he wants, remain a lovey dovey romcom or venture into some proper jungle\/desert killing action. Obviously it stays on the light side which equals some rather silly tame bad guy take downs which aren't really believable for the situation. The situation quite clearly shows that all the bad guys need to be killed off.So yeah the story is crap and that's a shame because the franchise is fine for a sequel. There is just enough juice left in Mick Dundee to squeeze out another fun film. The visuals gags are still keeping afloat just about, Hogan still looks the part perfectly as do all other cast members (great continuity) and the imagery of wild Australia in all its glory with the adding of more Aboriginal folk is still very welcome and quite original. But most importantly, overall its still a fun film that just about delivers...by the skin of its teeth. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 August 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Well we're back in the land of the rising sun...no wait, well the land of the bloody scorching sun anyway.

But most importantly, overall its still a fun film that just about delivers...by the skin of its teeth. 6\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"10 August 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Please note Although it is not written in full story, some paragraphs may contain plot information that could be a spoiler.Four Rooms is a 1995 anthology comedy film that follows Ted the Bellhop, the lone working employee, as he works New Years Eve at the Hotel Mon Signor in Los Angeles, interacting with several guests on four different rooms.

However, when they learn one of them is missing an ingredient needed to complete the spell, they convince Ted to help her out in retrieving the missing ingredient.---Room Review--- This is the weakest of the rooms.

At gunpoint, Ted is forced to participate in the scenario, with uncertainty of what is real and what is part of the fantasy.---Room Review--- Of the four segments, this is the second best one. The entire concept, story, directing, acting and comedy is stellar and all around shows how a great story can be told in a short time.9\/10Segment 3 Room 309 - The Misbehavers Written and directed by Robert RodriguezA husband and wife pay Ted to babysit their son and daughter as they go out to a New Years party. The very stern father demands his children to not misbehave and Ted to make sure they are well taken care of. Ted, alone in the hotel, cannot stay in the room so he orders them to stay in the room and watch TV. After Ted leaves, the children begin to explore and vandalize the room. After Ted arrives back after a few more times (the events of The Wrong Man take place during this room), the room is in total and complete chaos, which ends in a hilarious tone as the man and wife return.---Room Review--- The best of the rooms. Rodriguez cleverly put much thought and effort into this room using all of the actors skills, especially Tim Roth and made the entire film worth it.10\/10Segment 4 The Penthouse - The Man from Hollywood Written and directed by Quentin TarantinoAfter a famous director request several items, Ted brings them to the room and is soon acquainted with the party. Ted is asked to take part in a challenge that comes directly put of an episode of 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents'. Ted. Initially declines, but is offered a guarantee $100 just to listen to the request and an additional $1000 if he accepts.---Room Review--- The third best, or second worst, depending on how you think of it. The room, of course, has the Tarantino formula of characters that never stop talking. Of course, the concept is nowhere near as original or as far fetched as the others but is still a very stellar segment. They even mention the very episode of 'Hitchcock' they use in the conversation. The ending is perfect, however for Ted to end his otherwise very odd and terrible night.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 August 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Please note Although it is not written in full story, some paragraphs may contain plot information that could be a spoiler.Four Rooms is a 1995 anthology comedy film that follows Ted the Bellhop, the lone working employee, as he works New Years Eve at the Hotel Mon Signor in Los Angeles, interacting with several guests on four different rooms.

Dassin was a successful American director of film noirs up until the end of the 1940s when he was suddenly blacklisted during the days of the Senator Joe McCarthy witch hunts and barred from working in the United States. Speaking during a 2000 interview featured as part of the Criterion Collection's DVD extras, Dassin remarked that he was paid very little to direct 'Rififi' as the cast and crew also worked under an extremely low budget.'Rififi' is a very atmospheric film noir, shot intentionally under low light conditions. The plot revolves around a gang of jewel thieves led by Tony le Stéphanois (played by Jean Servais, a successful French actor in the 30s, whose career was in in decline at the time, due to alcoholism). Tony, just out of prison on a five year bid for a prior jewel heist, is approached by former pal, Jo, who proposes that they accept mutual friend Mario's plan to steal some jewels from a window display case of a prominent Parisian jewelry store. The plan is initially rejected by Tony who is preoccupied with his former girlfriend, Mado, who has taken up with a tough guy nightclub owner, Pierre Grutter. In the first of a number of scenes, craftily infused with a palpable, violent edge, Tony beats Mado up for going with this other guy.With Mado now out of his life, Tony decides to accept Mario's plan but instead of a simply 'smash-and-grab' of the jeweler's store window, he proposes knocking off a safe in the apartment above the jewelry store. Mario's friend, the Italian-speaking Cesar (played by director Dassin himself) is brought in to complete the team. The gang goes through a rehearsal before committing the crime itself. This mainly involves de-arming the sophisticated alarm system. I'm not sure if we needed all the pre-heist rehearsals, particularly because much of it is repeated during the actual heist itself (I'm thinking particularly of the spraying of the fire retardant foam into the alarm box, which appears to be rather redundant and anti-climactic).Nonetheless the bulk of the heist scene is particularly noteworthy due to its having been shot without any dialogue. Also quite remarkable is the way in which an umbrella is utilized to prevent the alarm from going off, during the burglary. To my surprise, this was actually based on a crime involving a travel agency break-in, dating back to 1899!After the heist is committed, the plot takes a few other clever twists and turns. The gang is undone by the simple greed of Cesar, who pilfers a small diamond ring for his girlfriend. Grutter and company get wind of this, and end up murdering Mario and his girlfriend (another shocking scene of violence in the film), in an attempt to extort information from Jo, as to the whereabouts of the very expensive jewels, taken from the jewel company's safe. I wonder why, however, Grutter's gang failed to ransack Mario's apartment, before giving up on trying to find the jewels.After Tony finds a tied-up Cesar (captured by Grutter), he reluctantly murders him in revenge for violating the 'code of silence' between thieves. It's said that this represented Dassin's feelings toward colleagues who betrayed other colleagues during the blacklist era.The plot races toward its inevitable conclusion after Grutter kidnaps Jo's son and holds him as ransom for the jewels. Tony tells Jo to sit tight while he tracks down the kid. But Jo can't wait and meets Grutter with the cash they got from a fence for the jewels. Inevitably Grutter kills Jo and is about to make off with the jewels when Tony shows up (somehow Mado had heard that Grutter had swiped Jo's son and knew where he was). With information provided by Mado, Tony indeed tracks Grutter down and after being seriously wounded, shoots and kills Grutter (why Grutter doesn't make sure Tony is dead, before attempting to make his get away), seems a bit far-fetched. Despite his crimes, Tony performs the great sacrifice by driving Jo's son all the way back home, before he expires, with a suitcase stuffed with millions, in the backseat.'Rififi' has all the ingredients of an engaging, taut, film noir. Particularly notable is the great on-location cinematography, sure-fire editing, very believable performances by some lesser-known actors as well as director Dassin's determination not to tone down the violent scenes in order to mollify a few prurient filmgoers. 'Rififi' suffers from a few flat notes including the long-winded 'heist rehearsal' as well as a number of (aformentioned) questionable plot contrivances, that don't always add up.Overall, 'Rififi' is a pretty, solid noir.

After I watched this film last night, I had a change of heart because I gave myself the opportunity to analyze the characters.The leading characters have no redeeming qualities, while the supporting cast added a silver lining. More on this later.Liza Minnelli's dancing and singing are on point and were delightful to watch. Cabaret inspired a slew of imitators. It is easy to see where many dancing female pop stars got their moves and act from. Bob Fosse and Liza Minnelli deserve a lot of credit for their body of work.Onto the negative aspects of the film. Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) is a walking stereotype of a cabaret act and veers on being caricature. She is so desperate, vapid, needy, promiscuous and is not a lot of fun to be with outside of the cabaret and parties. Ms. Bowles has unresolved daddy issues that contribute more to her personal failures more than she acknowledged. Brian Roberts (Michael York) starts out as a fly on the wall who has plenty of wiles of his own. He seems conflicted about his sexual orientation. He knows that he may be gay, but had a few affairs with women knowing that he went against himself. Mr. Roberts is resolute about social issues (e.g. growing Nazism and anti-Semitism), and this is where he shows his might. The film is much more sympathetic to Brian than Sally. We never get to see how Sally was affected by the growing right wing movement in Germany. Instead, she is depicted as too much of a superficial escapist to even care, which is worse. Brian's character gets to show all of his facets, not just his sexual and fun-loving side.Cabaret's brighter spots is the Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey). Under the guise of humor, he tells the truth. He is the quintessential court jester of Shakespearean times. The MC keeps the movie from turning soppy and unfocused. His mischievous appearance only adds more to the fascination. Grey's work cannot be underestimated.Fritz (Fritz Wepper) is pretty one dimensional, but because the film addresses anti-Semitism, his presence gives the film a greater heart. His relationship with Natalia (Marisa Berenson) is a big turning point for each other as Nazis take hold of Germany. When one contrasts Natalia with Sally, we the quintessential virgin-whore dichotomy that is as old as dirt. Natalia is good because she is virginal, sweet, conventional and cultured. Sally is bad because she is loose, dirty, vulgar and overly sexed. These women do not intersect. In fact, Natalia's critical of Sally's overt sexual expression.Baron Maximilian von Heune's (Helmut Griem) presence introduced another facet of Brian's personality. He has a price just like Sally and can be a rent boy under the right circumstances. Fancy items like cashmere sweaters and gold cigarette cases come with a price. However, the film treats Max and Brian's affair much more subduedly and respectfully than Sally.In the end, Cabaret did not leave me happy, with the exception of Fritz and Natalia's marriage.

It is easy to see where many dancing female pop stars got their moves and act from. Bob Fosse and Liza Minnelli deserve a lot of credit for their body of work.Onto the negative aspects of the film. Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) is a walking stereotype of a cabaret act and veers on being caricature. She is so desperate, vapid, needy, promiscuous and is not a lot of fun to be with outside of the cabaret and parties. Ms. Bowles has unresolved daddy issues that contribute more to her personal failures more than she acknowledged. Brian Roberts (Michael York) starts out as a fly on the wall who has plenty of wiles of his own. He seems conflicted about his sexual orientation. He knows that he may be gay, but had a few affairs with women knowing that he went against himself. Mr. Roberts is resolute about social issues (e.g. growing Nazism and anti-Semitism), and this is where he shows his might. The film is much more sympathetic to Brian than Sally.

As for me, I'm in the middle. My favorites are Leonardo (swordsman leader) and Michelangelo (goofball). Even after 14 years, I still like this movie, not as one of my all-time favorites, but enough to watch whenever, since this film has a charm that is difficult to resist (hey even Roger Ebert like it a little bit). The turtles in this film are presented pretty good and still hold up today as not only imaginative but entertaining as well, thanks to the magic of Jim Henson. Besides that the story makes a lot of sense as a martial arts drama with a little comedy and a good theme for kids that all parents love their children. There are a few faults such as Shredder's death and the fact that some believed the violence was a little over the top for kids, but today its pretty tame.

But he'd really rather be a cartoonist. After he and his best friend George Calamari (Joel Murray) graduate from high school, George decides to try lifting Hoops' spirits by inviting him to Georges' family's home on Nantucket Island. Hoops makes the best of things, finding one thing that he likes about the location in aspiring pop singer Cassandra Eldridge (Demi Moore). Unfortunately, a piece of property belonging to Cassandra's family is due to be taken away from her by scheming developer Aguilla Beckersted (Mark Metcalf). So Hoops does everything that he can to help her out, with the help of bumbling twins Egg and Clay Stork (Bobcat Goldthwait and Tom Villard).Holland can't help but fail to quite match the inspired zaniness of Better Off Dead with this sophomore effort. Overall it's just not as funny or as fresh. Of course, that doesn't mean that there aren't some great moments. Certainly the location is one big plus, and it's gorgeously shot by Isidore Mankofsky. Holland does include some amusing animated sequences, which he did himself. The characters are all pretty well defined, the heroes and the villains alike. (The villains aren't exactly subtle.) Cusack is engaging in the lead, and Moore is appealing as his love interest. Supporting players Murray, Curtis Armstrong (who plays a very non-Booger like role here), Goldthwait, and Villard are a hoot to watch; Goldthwaits' spastic shtick reaches a real zenith here. Metcalf and Matt Mulhern as his thuggish preppy son are guys whom you will love to loathe. And there are an incredible number of other familiar faces in the cast Laura Waterbury, John Matuszak, Jeremy Piven, Billie Bird, Joe Flaherty, William Hickey, Taylor Negron, Rich Hall, Donald Li, and Rich Little.There are some delicious gags scattered throughout, such as the obvious spoofs on Jaws, but best of all is Goldthwaits' big Godzilla scene. It's hilarious and is the highlight of the movie. Clearly Holland was enjoying himself coming up with such ridiculous character names.Never overly crude, this is an amiable feel good feature that, while rather predictable at its core, is still rather hard to resist.Seven out of 10.
