Because of this, I was impressed and charmed by the film's cute sense of humor and interesting story line. It kept me interested and laughing the whole way through. I was impressed to see that the writers did not go overboard about the Internet scheme (though AOL sure did with the advertisements), because it actually brought it out realistically and believably, mixing the reality and virtual reality together nicely. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks were the perfect duo again, and I particularly enjoyed how Hanks made his character one you would love one minute and hate the next...but feel sorry for him at the same time. I was not thrilled on going to see it, but I made a mistake. A must-see if you're into cute-romantics.

He is a very good actor and made me cry when he left. No other actor could do that. I wish he could have amounted to something more. Whereas Macauley Culkin became a huge star by just having a cute smile and the AAAHHH! while slapping his cheeks, Marc really was good in his role. I wish he would have starred in some other film.

It' s another masterpiece by Micheal Douglas. The film has a very high cinematic language. The story is great and treated in the most perfect way by the director of the film. The film appears at first to be a normal action movie, in which the rich Van Orton, chases the bad guys, who by the most original way washed him off all his money. Even this way it could have been a good movie, but a traditional one. Yet the writer had more tricks in his pocket. I don't want to spoil the plot, so I won't mention further details. But I must say that the event sequence cleared up to be most unexpected and most beautiful. The film is different because it turned into having no bad guys at all as appears in the end, this in itself is pure beauty as your mind doesn't contaminate with real violence and blood that fill most (almost all) of the action movies.  If you like Micheal Douglas then this is certainly your movie, for he almost plays solo here; all other characters are (not marginal) but complementary to his role; However, It's his life and his game. The director of the movie is the same director of Seven, another of my favorites. The film has nothing common with seven except the great cinematic language, the quick paced actions, the unexpected events, especially the end. That end is the most suitable for the film, any other end would have changed the whole idea behind the story; It wouldn't have been a game any more. Take my advice, watch that film (If you haven't yet), and don't let any one tell you its story before you watch it! I give the film 8\/10.

Even the songs are good, which doesn't happen too often.There are a lot of likable characters, such as Zeus, Phil, Hercules (obviously), and even Hades.
