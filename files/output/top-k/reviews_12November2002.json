I had high expectations, from all notices and such like; praise, adorned with phrases like incisive satire, stood out.

The Manchurian Candidate, Primary Colours, The Candidate, Bob Roberts and numerous others have far more to say. A main problem with this film is its anonymous, far from distinctive direction. There is no linking, imaginative vision holding together and underpinning the film. There is a painful contrast for this film, with virtually any made by the Coen Brothers, Wes Anderson, David Lynch, Terry Zwigoff, or indeed Donnie Darko's new director, Richard Kelly. There is not even the feeling that this is work compromised by committees and Hollywood marketing; the basic idea and execution are just nothing special. That this kind of film is so masqueraded as an incisive political satire is quite laughable; its message is far from new, and it consciously avoids any real political conflict. No issues are really raised, bar those of personality, for the main candidates.Matthew Broderick frankly irritates; this is no performance of stature; it's an example of unkempt, unsubtle acting lacking in nuance. It's just a turn and not one that really entertains. The thing is; the part could have been well played and carried a bit of impact, but it is squandered here. One really is not made to care about stopping Witherspoon's character, as the alternatives and the diffident Broderick hold no greater appeal.There ought not to be much said about the ill-judged forays into physical comedy; very mediocre stuff. It's all a shame really, as Reece Witherspoon is really quite impressive, albeit in a sure-fire role, that of high-flying, strutting, style-over-substance Miss Tracy Flick. It's not a teenage part of the depth or nuance of Donnie Darko or of Max Fischer, and it's really a shame more sides aren't brought out in her. But, and it is a considerable but, Witherspoon plays the fairly limited role to a tee; all saturnine flicks of the hair, ice maiden moral penury and gamine grimacing. One could say that Ms. Witherspoon overacts, but at least she is entertaining with it.It seems very much that she's gone on to a curious assortment of roles; ill-fitted playing Wilde; almost self-parody in Legally Blonde, as a bumptious, bitchy, indeed blonde; taking a supporting role alongside Sandler... It doesn't seem a considered career path on her part.There are stray good lines and ideas, but nothing really adds up; the plotting is inadequate and very predictable fare. This film is the sort where one is expecting so much more involvement, incident and intrigue than is delivered. The ending all too readily sums this up &#150; an easy, `moral' conclusion, showing Reece's character in a very simplistic light. It all comes across as glib rather than poignant, as seems to have been intended, not helped by the `knowing', pseudo-confiding smugness of the voice-over. So many post-modern films just resort to the voice-over tactic without any real reason; it's just a cover here, for lack of drama. The whole ending is a complete damp squib that thinks it's something profound, where it's really just one-dimensional and dramatically flat. Part of the problem is that no real case is made in favour of other characters than Tracy Flick; they're all irritating, limited or stereotypical. Indeed, many are easily forgettable; many are just plain annoying, and mere plot devices such as the rival candidate, dredged up to take on our Tracy.  But, we cannot really feel that much sympathy for her, due to the stridency of Witherspoon's playing; focused, but perhaps one-note acting that portrays the character as a preened, vacuous careerist without any tangible other sides. Dear Ms. Flick's just not human enough, or eccentric enough, shall we say. Basically, Election is a simplified faff that ought to have raised its game considerably. This film had a lot of potential, but we end up with a far from engaging, routine picture, possessed of a heart as hollow as those of its characters.

I hate preachy movies.`Signs' is a good flick. In the year of 2002 when a good flick is virtually non existent, it was a nice and welcoming relief. It's the story of an ex-preacher, Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), who lives out in the cornfields with his son and daughter, grieving over his dead wife. Suddenly crop circles begin to appear in his corn and strange goings on happen. It's a `sign' of stuff happening. But what is happening? What are the crop circles appearing everywhere indicating? Is it some other worldly force? And can Hess pull himself out of his despair and fight them? Hmmm.. Well - can he?!Acting here is all solid. Gibson isn't called to stretch himself - look angry here, look sad there, shoulder a burden of grief, question his faith, and so on. He's still well cast in his role though and never really lets the side down. The two kids are quite good. One is the Cute Girl #3 act going for, but we can expect that. It's Hollywood. Rory Culkin, as the young son Morgan, is actually one of the best surprises of the movie. He has a remarkable maturity to his acting, and is very believable as a quiet, introverted son. Hope he gets more work for himself, unlike his brother. Speaking of brothers, Joaquin Pheonix plays Gibson's brother, Merrill. He's there to provide the more light-hearted elements later on, but also as a foil to Gibson's taciturn nature. Pheonix is good, but not remarkable, failing to get into the role the way he could in, for example, `Gladiator'.Script wise? Well there's not much of one. It's `Close Encounters of the Third Kind' meets `Night of the Living Dead'. There is some ham fisted dialogue, principally when Shyamalan (writer and director here) gets all preachy and tries to teach us A Big Lesson. It's mostly when Gibson starts moralising and pondering aloud in the tired old `why me? Why this?' routine. The moments aren't quite too far and few between to be erased from my memory and it does detract from the enjoyment at time. I can watch a movie without being talked down to. Oh and that little bit with Pheonix's character? Too heavily fore-shadowed and sign posted. Subtlety is lacking in this script.That subtlety is lacking in the script is strange because it's certainly not lacking in the directing. It's what makes `Signs' move from an average movie to a sharp little thriller. Shyamalan uses a nice slow build up, that's ever increasing the paranoia and the tension. Wisely he eschews ever taking the camera much further than the farm land, creating a sense of isolation to the viewer. The jumps are not obviously sign posted, and dramatical music cues are minimalist to score maximum effect. The camera work is tight and focused, building up the eerie tension, and the lighting is spot on, with just the right level of creeping darkness. The sound work - sharp, crisp - is also very good. I don't think I've ever jumped so much at a cinema screening and it's a credit to the movie that it made me do that. It's only let down at the end with the weak ending and incredulous plot device. Still fair dues to Shyamalan for using his director's chair well.`Signs' is one of the best movies of 2002. Now that's not saying a whole lot as there's been little good (I'm pinning all my hopes on `The Two Towers') but this is certainly a movie worth seeing with the lights turned down.

One won't bother recounting the story, or the plotline, a viewer can gather that from history, OR previous reviews, OR even a casual overview of Dumas novels. One would like to speak to the filmmaking here, and along the way, on the movie.If one is at all interested in French history, one has already seen this movie a thousand* times, * meaning enough. However, a digital dvd transfer of the movie as it was originally intended to be seen by M. Chéreau, without subtitles, without interference,the VO version originale is stunning. The first and foremost difference is the lighting - il te frappe, as the French would say, it strikes you. Not being a technician, one can't speak to the difference between the film one saw on DVD and the film one saw in American theaters, or on American DVD, or even on VHS, French and\/or American. The difference is striking. From the opening scenes, one is suddenly, almost frightfully, drawn into the 16th century, an epoch without the cushions of modern life. The light is everywhere, and it shines in a way that is pitiless and revelatory. This was never, unfortunately, appparent to theater goers here, and, I suspect, to cinema goers in France. If it had been, there would have been Oscars. One is not sure cinema projection equipment can convey what M. Chéreau did with this film. Where there is light, there is liminality and where there are shadows, even there there is light, but it is dim (thus not liminal), and the cadaverous flesh of the living players conveys more than anyone could ever say in dialogue - these are dead people, living out a drama that is already predestined for them, which is a marvelously conceived conceit of the filmmaker. M. Chéreau is playing with predestination and Fate here, and it is through the art of cinema that he is doing it. Mlle Adjani turns in a bravura performance, and it is only by grace of Jeanne Moreau's 1954 performance that we have any scale of comparison. Moreau's performance is cool, ice and politics, but Adjani's is heat, love and politics, and suited to her generation. Vincent Perez is suitably heroic (watch the rose tones come and go on his flesh as the light changes). The kudos for male performances, however, are shared by Jean-Hugues Anglade, long an underrated French actor, and Daniel Auteuil, too long appreciated for his bravura performances elsewhere and not given enough credit for what he can do with a gesture, with a line, with a look. M. Auteuil is almost always lit with cool hypocrisy, (ambers and greens) as suits his performance, but M. Anglade turns in one of the best roles of his career as the doomed Charles IX, and he never looks less than on death's door. A naturally sensitive actor, he adds a touch of soullessness to his Charles IX that is unforgettable - weak, yes, king, yes, momma's boy, yes, but also, in the end, needy child. It is stunning in its ultimate simplicity as a performance for cinema. Very few performances in film measure up to Virna Lisi's Catherine de Medici(s) the s is French spelling. She is incroyable (incredible), and something was wrong when she wasn't recognized universally as '94's best supporting actress. Her queen is multi-layered, loving, hating, deeply cynical yet naively superstitious, playing son against son and daughter against political reality, in other words a perfect incarnation of the 16th century in France. Any political woman you can think of could have sat at her feet and learned lessons on how to do it. Mme Lisi herself might have been a confidante to the real Catherine, she is that good in this role. She was crowned for this performance in Europe, but should have been crowned universally. Watch her as she vacillates between love and hate and politics, and especially watch the lighting - it subtly changes according to her role of the moment. Watch her carefully towards the end, as Fate winds things up, and watch an actress give herself up totally to the role, to the moment, in order to incarnate a character that is absolutely unforgettable.Apparently, M. Chéreau lets his actors know what he is doing, because they respond in according  shades of emotion. When the lighting is dim, or the focus is midrange, they fuzz a little, giving the viewer a sense of their uncertainty, but if he focuses, they focus, too, and there are frightening moments of soul-baring intimacy when you almost want to look away - it is like watching your intimates make love; too much, too intimate, too deep. Dominique Blanc turns in a nearly flawless performance as the over-the-top lady-in-waiting to Margot - watch her lighting, too, and how she responds. Conspiratrice, duchesse, cynical woman in love despite herself, she is very, very good. Pascal Greggory as the future Henri III is wonderful, and the rest of the cast stand out. This was obviously a labor of love and intensity, and all gave their best to M. Chéreau.In the end, one keeps wondering what it is about the film that was so memorable - and the french dvd transfer makes it perfectly clear. The performances, yes; the mise en scène, yes; the director, certainly. But it is the whole, the light and the shadows, the darkness and the glow, as in those candles in the marvelous square paper lanterns in the late night of the Louvre as the people begin to weave their plots, that make it memorable. Good actors, great performances, and a sure director - flawless cinema.

However I did not do things which could harm me or anyone else. In Larry Clark's &#145;Kids', he leaves nothing to your imagination as we see kids doing things I know I would cringe at if I saw happening in real life. This film shows what sex drugs and violence can do to adolescents in this day and age, in addition to what &#145;low-budget' film making is all about.This is a bleak and uncompromising look at the dangerous world of New York street kids in the 90's.  It shows the generation of tomorrow living for today on drugs, sex and violence. You will follow a typical 24 hours for teenagers, Telly, Casper, Jennie, Ruby and Darcy, as they indulge in their pubescent sexual appetites and cure their boredom with any substance they can get their hands on. &#145;Kids' is the film that you thought America would never dare dream of making.Larry Clark has once again pushed the boundaries to what makes a good film. But for some reason I was enthralled by what kids was all about. Clark steps into the &#145;teenage' world beautifully, and does it in such a way, that nothing is hidden to his viewers. I have viewed &#145;Kids' just a fortnight after seeing Clark's other masterpiece, &#145;Bully'. In fact the resemblance to that film is quite evident to me, although it is nowhere nears as explicit in its vision as Bully was. The slack is taken up by its language.Clark also has a unique style of directing, whereby his viewers become part of the movie. I know I felt this way with &#145;Kids', which makes watching these sorts of films much easier. &#145;Kids' was heavily focused on the young people and what they do. This was a clever and deliberate move by Clark. In fact you can be mistaken for thinking that there is no other people in the world besides these &#145;kids', as the adults in the movie are few and fair between. It is as if they do not exist. I still think that Clark is a voyeur, and someone who is fascinated in the sexual exploration of young people, with &#145;Kids' going even deeper into a &#145;child's psyche' and what it is like for them to &#145;experiment'. This story follows the lives of a young group of teenage louts who have very little to do with their time. Its main character is Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick), a boy who delights in sleeping only with virgins. The girls fall for him, for reasons which are beyond me, as Telly is a very sleazy looking guy in this film. The film starts there, with Telly seducing a girl, then in the next moment is gloating to his friend Casper (Justin Pierce), about what the experience was like. The language these boys are using in public is quite amazing. The story soon switches to the female gender. They openly talk about what sex means to them. Jennie (Chloë Sevigny) and Ruby (Rosario Dawson) are the main girl characters. The story follows them both to a health clinic, where the pair is getting tested for AIDS. This was Chloë Sevigny's first ever movie role, one that she was perfect for. The other characters are not as well known to the audience. They are down and out kids who delight in doing things that &#145;kids' definitely should not be doing. There are some amazing scenes attached to this movie. In one scene, we see one of the &#145;gang' who is being bothered by a stranger. When his friends see that he is in trouble, the violent retaliation that they take out on this stranger is disturbing. In fact the group is wondering afterwards, &#145;did we kill that guy?' Then for contrast the following scene shows Jennie as she is being driven around by a New York cabbie. After seeing such violence, this scene talks of Jennie's beauty, as the drivers remarks to her, `If you want to be happy, don't think, don't bump into any walls and if you stutter, don't talk'. Even though she knows this true, deep down Jennie knows her irresponsible &#145;choice' in life will make this virtually impossible. This film also looks at the issues of safe sex and STDs (sexually transmitted diseases). The girls at the health clinic are told be &#145;careful', when being sexually active. However to see how careless the males of the story are with their sexuality, makes me pleased that people can see what &#145;sleeping around' can do. Telly openly admits at the end of the movie &#145;F_____g is what I love. Take that away, I have nothing.' If young kids treat sex as a game or conquest, like Telly does, then I am sure they will get into trouble that not even they could comprehend.I watched this movie on my own, but I am sure if I had watched it with other people than there would be a lot to talk about. That is what people need to do when there is a film such as &#145;Kids', talk about it. I believe that young groups like those in this film would be hard to find, well I pray that this is true anyway. Yet some are. If I was to come across such a group of young kids today, I would be scared and unsure of what to say or do. &#145;Kids' is a movie that will confront you to the limit, with its story, camera work and language. It also makes me feel lucky that my childhood was &#145;innocent and trouble-free'.

For starter's let's look at the simple premise - James Stewart is L. B. Jeffries, a photographer who is currently recovering from an injury on assignment. With his broken leg he's stuck in his apartment, with nothing better to do than spy on his neighbours and be visited by his girlfriend, Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly), his officer friend Wendell, and his nurse, Stella. Jeffries observes the coming and goings of the various apartments he can observe (from his rear apartment window) and it is one of these - a Raymond Burr - who draws his attention because. could it be that the man has committed some heinous crime? Let's find out.One of the beautiful things about the movie is its superb use of location. The whole movie, bar a couple of brief scenes, is set in the apartment. This would seem claustrophobic but Hitchcock never inhibits us like this - he lets us escape through Jeffries binoculars and camera lenses, and his roving camera swoops down to let us see what the characters see (but never, thankfully, anything more than that - this is how you do suspense!). The set design is wonderful - the apartment is just the right size and is nicely laid out. However the real praise is for all the other apartments visible to Jeffries - an actual habitable set with multiple stories where characters can be observed only as they pass by their own windows (yeah, they don't care much for curtains). There's a sense of individuality gone in to each home, despite the fact we can only see barely elements of each. This is helped by a nice, differing range of characters inhabiting each and going about their daily lives - there's a mini soap-opera contained in the movie, all observed at a distance. Excellent stuff.Acting? It's great here. There's some nice depth to the characters here, with them feeling like actual real people rather than slick one-dimensional tags. Stewart is very proficient in this type of role - he was born to it - and Kelly proves she is more than just a pretty face, managing to effuse her character with both grace (*groan*) and steel. Even supporting characters like Stella are good (she has a wickedly black sense of thinking that's hilarious). What's so incredible is that the characters we observe from a distance in the other apartments (and with whom we never actually interact with) have as much depth as most main characters in movies nowadays. Excellent script and acting in this movie.I've already praised Hitchcock's set location and camera work, so I won't prattle on about him much more. He does a stellar job here and, in my opinion, this is the best piece of work he's done (that I've seen). It's virtually flawless and you're never let down (or bored). Well done. It's a shame he lost out on an Oscar (although he did have tough competition that year with `On the Waterfront').`Rear Window' is a great example of how you can successfully have sharp acting, script, and directing and not feel the need for a slew of swear words and gratuitous violence.

Its characters were cleverly designed and distinctively show us what their morals really are. The title of this film was ingeniously thought up by Allen and will make you ponder such questions as What are the consequences of my actions? How far would I go to commit murder? Or is admitting to my &#145;misdemeanors' a more sensible line of reasoning? Judah Rosenthal is a respected, wealthy Eye doctor whose world begins to crumble around him when his mistress, Dolores Paley, threatens him with blackmail. Desperate and confused, he must decide whether he can face getting rid of her- permanently! As a comical balance to this chilling tragedy, Cliff Stern is an insecure film-maker who is about to tackle the hardest job of his life, filming a glowing tribute to the man he hates the most in the world &#150; his famous, pompous, pretentious and slimy brother-in-law, Lester.  &#145;Crimes and Misdemeanors' is a cinematic masterpiece of Woody Allen's. He wrote a wonderful and inventive script, which is up-beat and interesting. Then for him to be able to star and direct the film, makes his efforts all the more astounding. Allen's attention to detail is excellent, with the story being funny, thrilling and suspenseful at various times. I like the many elements Allen has interweaved in it. One is the use of &#145;eyes', as many of its characters have glasses, feel like they are &#145;being watched', its main star is an &#145;Ophthalmologist', with another going blind. I feel Allen is trying to say that there is someone looking over us, in a bleak world. Many scenes also show the use of the Telephone. This part of the film is talking about communication. Some characters complain that they cannot get there message through, which is a lack of communication. This film also has many parts which show its characters to be either black or white, with some showing shades of grey. This proves that there are some good and bad characters in the film showing that have elements of both. Finally the use of   &#145;a movie within a movie' is quite obvious here. We see a film being made or watched by Cliff many times.There are some fascinating characters in this film. Martin Landau received an academy award nomination for his most difficult role of Judah, which he performed beautifully. I like how he is torn by the guilt of living in two different worlds. His &#145;Crimes and Misdemeanors' certainly make him very uncomfortable. Yet on the surface Judah does not seem like such a bad guy. However his brother Jack (Jerry Orbach) is a cold man, who has a much better sense of reality, and does not suffer from any sort guilt via his actions.  Judah's Mistress is the flight attendant Dolores Paley (Angelica Houston). The struggle that she has to go through for the man she loves is a very strong part of the film.Then you have Allen's sorry character of Cliff, whose life is so depressing, that you really feel sorry for him. I love his line of &#145;The last time I was inside a woman was when I visited the statue of liberty'. He hates his brother in law, Lester (Alan Alda), whose part in this movie was great. Cliff is falling deeply in love with the attractive production assistant Halley Reed (Mia Farrow). Another important character is the Rabbi Ben (Sam Waterston). With him going blind being of great significance to the story, as it shows how blind the other cast members really are. He says to Judah in reference to murder, &#145;could you sleep with that?'There are some great scenes in &#145;Crimes and Misdemeanors'. I like how the movie starts, showing how great a person Judah Rosenthal is. Then the clever use of flashbacks is a great way to show what the story is all about. We see how far Judah will go to stop his wife from finding out that he is being unfaithful. I also like the flashback which shows Judah and Dolores on the beach. They are talking very sweetly, she even hears hints of marriage. The scene showing Judah returning to his childhood home is brilliant, as he realises that he has done a terrible thing. All of the scenes involving Lester are very humorous. I like how we see the final cut of his &#145;documentary', as Cliff gets his revenge on his brother-in-law, in very funny way. The final scenes, between Cliff and Judah at the wedding reception are of the finest quality. When Cliff says &#145;I am plotting a murder', you can see how these two characters lives seem almost the same. It is the perfect conclusion to a great movie.Although &#145;Crimes and Misdemeanors' might not be a &#145;big-budget' production, with dazzling special effects, it is a film which shows us just why we watch movies, with an intricate story, subtle uses of comedy and impressive cast. However, it also gives its audience a chance to understand themselves just a little bit more.  It is a film which is very much about choice. I think its message is &#145;it is how we handle the outcome of our choices, which determines what sort of person we turn out to be.' I like it for other reasons as well. It distinctively shows us how bad our &#145;sinful' nature can be. My family has gone through a similar crisis as what Judah's family could have. While I found it hard to accept that one of my parents could be unfaithful to the other or their family, I feel lucky that we did not have to go through the nonsense that Judah did. I know when I am in a loving relationship, I will be careful not to fall into the trap of being &#145;deceitful' to my partner, like many people have and still continue to do.CMRS gives &#145;Crimes and Misdemeanors' 5 (Brilliant Film)  ","genre":null},{"date":"12 November 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Woody Allen's &#145;Crimes and Misdemeanors' is a brilliant movie, which explores deep into our very existence.

Judah Rosenthal is a respected, wealthy Eye doctor whose world begins to crumble around him when his mistress, Dolores Paley, threatens him with blackmail. Desperate and confused, he must decide whether he can face getting rid of her- permanently! As a comical balance to this chilling tragedy, Cliff Stern is an insecure film-maker who is about to tackle the hardest job of his life, filming a glowing tribute to the man he hates the most in the world &#150; his famous, pompous, pretentious and slimy brother-in-law, Lester.  &#145;Crimes and Misdemeanors' is a cinematic masterpiece of Woody Allen's. He wrote a wonderful and inventive script, which is up-beat and interesting. Then for him to be able to star and direct the film, makes his efforts all the more astounding. Allen's attention to detail is excellent, with the story being funny, thrilling and suspenseful at various times. I like the many elements Allen has interweaved in it. One is the use of &#145;eyes', as many of its characters have glasses, feel like they are &#145;being watched', its main star is an &#145;Ophthalmologist', with another going blind. I feel Allen is trying to say that there is someone looking over us, in a bleak world. Many scenes also show the use of the Telephone. This part of the film is talking about communication. Some characters complain that they cannot get there message through, which is a lack of communication. This film also has many parts which show its characters to be either black or white, with some showing shades of grey. This proves that there are some good and bad characters in the film showing that have elements of both. Finally the use of   &#145;a movie within a movie' is quite obvious here. We see a film being made or watched by Cliff many times.There are some fascinating characters in this film. Martin Landau received an academy award nomination for his most difficult role of Judah, which he performed beautifully. I like how he is torn by the guilt of living in two different worlds. His &#145;Crimes and Misdemeanors' certainly make him very uncomfortable. Yet on the surface Judah does not seem like such a bad guy. However his brother Jack (Jerry Orbach) is a cold man, who has a much better sense of reality, and does not suffer from any sort guilt via his actions.  Judah's Mistress is the flight attendant Dolores Paley (Angelica Houston). The struggle that she has to go through for the man she loves is a very strong part of the film.Then you have Allen's sorry character of Cliff, whose life is so depressing, that you really feel sorry for him. I love his line of &#145;The last time I was inside a woman was when I visited the statue of liberty'. He hates his brother in law, Lester (Alan Alda), whose part in this movie was great. Cliff is falling deeply in love with the attractive production assistant Halley Reed (Mia Farrow). Another important character is the Rabbi Ben (Sam Waterston). With him going blind being of great significance to the story, as it shows how blind the other cast members really are. He says to Judah in reference to murder, &#145;could you sleep with that?'There are some great scenes in &#145;Crimes and Misdemeanors'. I like how the movie starts, showing how great a person Judah Rosenthal is. Then the clever use of flashbacks is a great way to show what the story is all about. We see how far Judah will go to stop his wife from finding out that he is being unfaithful. I also like the flashback which shows Judah and Dolores on the beach. They are talking very sweetly, she even hears hints of marriage. The scene showing Judah returning to his childhood home is brilliant, as he realises that he has done a terrible thing. All of the scenes involving Lester are very humorous. I like how we see the final cut of his &#145;documentary', as Cliff gets his revenge on his brother-in-law, in very funny way. The final scenes, between Cliff and Judah at the wedding reception are of the finest quality. When Cliff says &#145;I am plotting a murder', you can see how these two characters lives seem almost the same. It is the perfect conclusion to a great movie.Although &#145;Crimes and Misdemeanors' might not be a &#145;big-budget' production, with dazzling special effects, it is a film which shows us just why we watch movies, with an intricate story, subtle uses of comedy and impressive cast. However, it also gives its audience a chance to understand themselves just a little bit more.  It is a film which is very much about choice. I think its message is &#145;it is how we handle the outcome of our choices, which determines what sort of person we turn out to be.' I like it for other reasons as well. It distinctively shows us how bad our &#145;sinful' nature can be. My family has gone through a similar crisis as what Judah's family could have. While I found it hard to accept that one of my parents could be unfaithful to the other or their family, I feel lucky that we did not have to go through the nonsense that Judah did. I know when I am in a loving relationship, I will be careful not to fall into the trap of being &#145;deceitful' to my partner, like many people have and still continue to do.CMRS gives &#145;Crimes and Misdemeanors' 5 (Brilliant Film)  ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"12 November 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Woody Allen's &#145;Crimes and Misdemeanors' is a brilliant movie, which explores deep into our very existence.

Mendes has done it again, this time even more movingly and compellingly.  I give kudos to all the actors! Hanks does a splendid job portraying Michael Sullivan, a hit man for gangster John Rooney, played by Newman, who also does a wonderful job. Sullivan's son is played by Tyler Hoechlin, whom I believe has made an amazing breakthrough appearance, and this is not the last time we will be seeing him.*SPOILERS* This movie has many intricate details which I believe should be taken to heart in order to fully appreciate this film.  In the opening scene, Michael Sullivan, Jr. is seen riding his bike in a crowd of people - only, if you notice (and its hard not to), he's riding against the flow.  This detail may seem minor, but it foreshadows the fact that he will have to face many issues and events head on, some of which he will have to deal with completely by himself, even without his father.  Also to take into consideration  when Maguire (Jude Law) gets sliced and diced by the broken vase, one can only assume that he is NOT invincible and will eventually reach his downfall.  Film noir is also a key element in this film, with the car driving off in the dark, the dark bicycle in the snow, dimly lit up only for a second, and the tommy-gun surrounded by the shadows and rain.  No, this isn't a light movie, and much of the elements used to make this film have not been used for a long, long time, and they are all worth noticing and fully appreciating, which only adds to the glamour of this movie. That is, if you have the guts to get over your superficial visions that this is a horrible, boring movie and see it as one of the greatest movies of all time.IMHO, everyone needs to stop bashing Hanks for playing his role heartlessly.  Excuse me, the man was just given the AFI LIfe Achievement Award!!!  He's got to have a little heart in everything he does, don't you think?  He also should have the ability to act his roles beyond the level of any he has ever attemted to portray...  I applaud him at his wonderful performance of playing a cold, dark, evil hit man, only to be mirrored by his unconditional love for his son.  The fact that he does *yes, he really does* portray a murderous gangster who must fight outer battles as well as inner battles proves that the man can't be typecast - something that as a fellow Actor I understand!!!  It can only help to prove that you are well rounded enough to play any role, no matter what you've done in the past. His superb balance of coldness, fury, humor, and love deserves nothing than a nomination from the Academy.The story itself is wonderful - a hit man gets in too deep when his son sees him doing his job, only to come home one night and find he has lost his wife and a son.  Father and son then set out to save themselves, which ultimately becomes a bonding experience, with or without the bank robberies or running. Being able to see a heartless gangster character with so much love and emotion for his family and closest friends is a stirring, gut-wrenching balance that is fresh and new, and should be noticed by all who watch this movie.I recommend this movie to everyone who wants a fresh change.  I found it simply marvelous, and I will go see it again.  If you pay attention to the story and the details that make it so wonderful, you won't go home dissapointed and you will find that its some of the best money spent in a while.  10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 November 2002","score":"","review":"  ***SPOILERS***Okay, am I one of only 20 people in the world that love this movie?I have nothing bad to say about this movie.

They are sadly mistaken.I LOVE the mockumentary format, and I also love noticing the differences between different mockumentary films.

His Shatner-esque style has always been more entertaining than the real Shatner, and even though it's just a cameo, he still livens up the screen here.

However when three muggers attack his home, killing his wife and leaving his daughter traumatised to a vegetative state.  Hersey struggles with his loss and agrees to take a business trip away from New York.  On this trip he is introduced to guns and on his return to New York he finds solace in `defending' himself against New York's criminal element.  The police find he reduces crime but sets a worrying trend for others to follow.I have never seen a Death Wish film and I felt that to judge them fairly I needed to go back to the first one rather than any of the sequels.  I knew that Michael Winner is pretty right wing but I didn't expect him to have his politics driven through this as crudely as he did.  The plot is simplicity itself, from the obvious set-up through to the stupid ending.  It has drama, action and excitement but it is spoil by the horrid taste of a director campaigning to make his crass point in the laziest way imaginable.From the start the film makes Hersey a liberal &#150; by merely having two people accuse him of it twice.  The film paints all the criminals the same way &#150; animals, crazy people, crazy pointless people.  There is no room for pity for these people, no room for understanding.  Cops are also played as decent chaps who are handcuffed by the system.  All Winner's sympathy and understanding is saved for Hersey &#150; Winner too clearly admires and agrees with his character and this again tips the film away from any attempt to be a balanced argument.  Even those on the political right may struggle with how heavy handed this film is.Bronson is fine and gives his usual stoney performance.  He does, however, bring out some internal emotional conflict well.  But before long he is on the road to violent redemption and such character issues are left behind.  The rest of the cast are clumsy stereotypes &#150; wives and daughters are clean white-bread stock while criminals are ethnic groups or crazy white people and so on.  It spoils the film that Winner makes his case with such desperation.

Those folks have not seen this version of The Thing because it is right up there with Halloween.John Carpenter's work shines in this film. He took a film that was already made and instead of re-making the film, he made the book the first film was based on! Brilliant.The casting of each man was great, the tension between them was real, it made me scream, made me scared, made me guess, made me laugh, made me question, even up to today who goes there? in that film. This film had no Hollywood sweetie pie or funny-type ending, and what a bold move not to have one in 1982. Another brilliant move.I was at the screening for this film when I was on vacation in Southern California. The audience at the screening went wild! I carry those memories for years, it was so much fun! We all thought that there was no way on God's green earth this film was not going to be a hit. But by box office receipts, it was a dud because of ET, The Extra Terrestrial and Poltergeist two very good family oriented films took the box office in 1982 when this film came out.This film was what I, as a horror film adult buff was looking for, a horror\/thriller with an adult script, and real adult actors. Not kids playing adults. Not little Miss big-breasted scream-queen of the day running around screaming for titilation BUT real guys with real problems delivering some of the best monologues you'll ever hear. Heck, being a feminist, I didn't even MISS women in this film! And good for Mr. Carpenter by not putting one in there, it really wouldn't have made sense! (Unless, The Thing was actually feminine! Something to think about!)I saw special effects of that time I had never seen before, I saw makeup that made me sit up a few nights. This is what horror\/thrillers of today are missing. Today, the Directors wimp out. Today, the Studios wimp out. Too much CGI and not enough belief, too much CGI and not enough story, not enough imagination.

This film is NOT for everyone.I find it horrific that they lable this film a cult film. I find that the audience is broader than many would lead you to belive and although not a commercial success in 1982, this is an example of how releasing a darn good film on the wrong date can make a darn good film look bad. After John Carpenter's film, many people copied many techniques, make-up, special effects and story lines from this version of The Thing.I am now excitd to go on record and state that this film is one of the best films of all time, very much under rated.

It triggered something in my head and I remembered being impressed with what I saw, so for $17 I picked it up...Till this day I still think about it sometimes and can say that it has been one of the more notable masterpieces made... The film is almost a documentary, a look at addiction and drugs, in the same sense you become attached to the characters that it's almost a biographical story of their lives. The characters almost become a part of you, in so many ways you feel for them, and realize that in each of their own there just trying to find success and their own definition of happiness.The movie starts off maybe a bit slow, but once it engages, it changes from a movie to almost an experience. For the record the first time I actually watched the WHOLE film, I almost just sat there, staring at my TV screen, both thinking and shocked of what I had witnessed.

One is that humans think monsters are scary, and two, is that humans really scare them! I cannot remember the last time I enjoyed a cartoon or a movie so much. I know that Pixar has had great success with many animated movies in the past. However, I feel that &#145;Monsters Inc.' out-classes such titles as, &#145;Toy Story', &#145;Shrek' and &#145;A Bug's Life' by far. With its funny story, great characters and wonderful voiceovers, &#145;Monsters, Inc.' will be a tough act to follow in the world of movie animation. Take a look at the monsters who say &#145;We Scare Because We Care'.Monsters, Inc. is the largest scare factory in the monster world. The top kid scarer is James Sully Sullivan, a huge intimidating monster with blue fur, large purple spots and horns. His scare assistant and best friend is Mike Wazowski, a lime green, opinionated, feisty, one-eyed monster. Scaring children isn't such an easy job, monsters believe children are toxic and that direct contact with them would be catastrophic. Inside the factory can be found the factory's crab-like CEO Henry J. Waternoose, the beguiling serpent-haired receptionist Celia and the sarcastic chameleon monster, Randall Boggs, who schemes to replace Sully as Monsters Inc.'s top Scarer. Visiting from the human world is Boo, a tiny girl who turns Mike and Sully's world upside-down.There is so much to like about &#145;Monsters, Inc.'. The team from Pixar really give great attention to detail when they bring out an animated feature. I really like the computer animated graphics, as many of these characters to me seem to be real. The many facial expressions these monsters have are just wonderful. They were so funny, that they made me laugh many times. The sounds used in &#145;Monsters Inc' were of the finest quality and help to define the monsters and the world they live in. I also like the story that Pixar made for this film. Having doors between the monsters world and ours is clever. Also having the story follow the fortunes of Mike and Sully is good, as it is never dull or boring when it come to those two characters. Add in the what Boo does to the story, I feel it makes for the perfect script. I enjoy how this story ends, as it made me feel very satisfied for watching.The characters that were invented for this film are some of the best I have ever seen. My favourite is the simple, but idiotic eyeball, &#145;Mike Wazowski'. Almost every time I saw his eye appear onscreen, he would make me laugh. Mike's best friend, is James &#145;Sully' Sullivan, and scaring kids is what he is really good at. Mike and Sully are a great team. There characters show the audience that real friends stick together through thick and thin. The other good characters include Mike's love interest Celia. The nicknames the pair call each other are hilarious. I cannot forget to mention one of the main stars of the show, Boo (Mary Gibbs). She is the little child who manages to make her way inside &#145;Monsters, Inc.'. I love her funny cry of &#145;Mike-Wazowski'. Yet with the good comes the bad. The meanest monster in &#145;Monstropolis' is a snaky chameleon character, called Randal Boggs. He is trying to become the number one scream collector at &#145;Monsters, Inc'. Another character not be trusted or liked at &#145;Monsters Inc' is Henry J. Waternoose, the CEO of the plant. He is a cross between a crab and spider, and only wants his employees to scare children and make him successful.The voiceovers used in this film were &#145;out of this world'. Having stars such as Billy Crystal as Mike, John Goodman as Sully, Jennifer Tilly as Celia, James Coburn as Henry and Steve Buscemi as Randall, were all perfect choices to voice each character. You can actually picture Crystal as Mike, the talkative sidekick and Goodman as Sully, the big cuddly blue Monster, who really does care about everyone. I love Roger Ebert's cheeky comment in reference to Jennifer Tiley's character of Celia, `What she (Celia) sees in him (Mike) is beyond me, although if there is anyone who can figure out how to have sex with a green eyeball, that would be Jennifer Tilly. I can imagine her brassy voice 'Blink! Blink!'.'  \tThere are some great scenes in &#145;Monsters, Inc'. I like almost every scene with Mike, as he is crazy, funny and stupid. Sully's introduction with Boo is also a highlight, as we all see what a little child can do to &#145;the number one scarer'. Then what follows is the funny scene where Mike says the silly line of `This is for the up-coming company play &#145;put that thing back where it came from or so help me'. Watch out for the play on the DVD, it is a classic extra feature. Another entertaining sequence in the film is the rollercoaster chase that Mike and Sully have to do, contending with hundreds of conveyor-driven doors to make sure that Boo is safe.I recently had the chance to compare the other animated film which has been released at the moment, &#145;Ice Age'. While I know it has had good reviews from many people, I found to be nowhere near as good as what 'Monsters, Inc.' was or is. Pixar is truly talented at bringing us movies, which are normally thought to be &#145;just for children'. However, this movie can be enjoyed by many different groups as its genre suggests, such as the &#145;whole family'. I know being a kid helps me for starters, but if you cannot like &#145;Mike and the gang' then there is something wrong. I wait in anticipation for what Pixar brings us next. If you are a true movie fan, then do yourself a favour and &#145;show that you care' by watching this animated classic.CMRS gives 'Monsters, Inc' 5 (Brilliant Film)   ","genre":null},{"date":"12 November 2002","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  After you have seen Pixar's &#145;Monsters, Inc.' two things are apparent about monsters.

The many facial expressions these monsters have are just wonderful. They were so funny, that they made me laugh many times.

I love Roger Ebert's cheeky comment in reference to Jennifer Tiley's character of Celia, `What she (Celia) sees in him (Mike) is beyond me, although if there is anyone who can figure out how to have sex with a green eyeball, that would be Jennifer Tilly.

One is that humans think monsters are scary, and two, is that humans really scare them! I cannot remember the last time I enjoyed a cartoon or a movie so much. I know that Pixar has had great success with many animated movies in the past. However, I feel that &#145;Monsters Inc.' out-classes such titles as, &#145;Toy Story', &#145;Shrek' and &#145;A Bug's Life' by far. With its funny story, great characters and wonderful voiceovers, &#145;Monsters, Inc.' will be a tough act to follow in the world of movie animation. Take a look at the monsters who say &#145;We Scare Because We Care'.Monsters, Inc. is the largest scare factory in the monster world. The top kid scarer is James Sully Sullivan, a huge intimidating monster with blue fur, large purple spots and horns. His scare assistant and best friend is Mike Wazowski, a lime green, opinionated, feisty, one-eyed monster. Scaring children isn't such an easy job, monsters believe children are toxic and that direct contact with them would be catastrophic. Inside the factory can be found the factory's crab-like CEO Henry J. Waternoose, the beguiling serpent-haired receptionist Celia and the sarcastic chameleon monster, Randall Boggs, who schemes to replace Sully as Monsters Inc.'s top Scarer.
