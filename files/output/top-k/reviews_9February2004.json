A steel arrow! There must be more around! in russian). Like some people earlier pointed out, you get a chance to see some future stars in this movie.Second...even though it's been pointed out that the movie was made in the 1980s and right in the midst of the Cold War, it seems people still try to use modern ideology in criticizing the movie. It also seems that some people are not really watching the movie because alot of the gripes were answered in the movie. Here's some answers -Russians all over the place  Watch again. In Colorado, it was mostly Cuban and Central American troops. There were few Russian troops in the area. -Russians got so far into the US undetected  Again, Powers Boothe's character explained HOW it happened..recap..USSR nuked the eastern seaboard and parts of the midwest (SAC, NORAD). The Russians held the East Coast while combined Cuban and Central American troops came up through Mexico and spilled into the southwest. In other words, US troops got outflanked because most were probably in Europe after the Russians and the Warsaw Pact countries ran across the Fulda Gap in Germany. -Hijacked airliners  Right...russians could never hijack an airliner..just like middle eastern terrorists could never hijack an airliner and crash it into a building. Actually, in the late 70s and early 80s there were a slew of hijackings, mostly by Cubans trying to get the US as well as others across the globe (Entebbe anyone?) - Jocks save the day  actually, rewatch the film. Patrick's character and his brother hunted in the woods. In small towns in the US, it's not uncommon for jocks to be avid hunters as well. -Sexism  I believe Jennifer Grey adressed that point in the movie...and yes, back then in small towns, (and even to this day) there were\/are men like that.Simply, yes, it was a propaganda film (not the best) and trying to compare it to modern day ideals instead of the ideals of the day when it was made, isnt really a true review, but just a gripe. Just think...in 20 years or so, someone is going to say the Lord of the Rings triology was total crap, badly acted, scripted and the spfx were so mundane..yet it's up for lots of Oscars this year.

Making matters still more difficult is the variety of extremely thick accents - to a point of entire sections of dialogue or monologue occasionally flying by with only a single word or two actually registering with me. While it added to film's authenticity, that got to be more than a bit annoying after a while. Where's that closed captioned TV set when you desperately need it?As far as the treatment of the subjects themselves goes, the movie does an adequate job. I mean, when it gets right down to it, the only structure such a film can more-or-less follow is the basic listing of a series of real events (and in this particular case most of them already well documented). Naturally, as such it doesn't allow for a whole lot of substantial artistic freedom so the director employs many little asides, winks and nudges by our narrator Tony Wilson (often through the 'fourth wall') as well as visual tricks and, obviously, music to make this different from, say, something you might see on VH1's 'Behind the Music'. In addition to being one of the major driving forces behind the whole scene, Tony also held a full-time job at Granada TV all throughout this period, which the movie uses skillfully for comic relief.Predictably (not that I'm complaining), things like Ian Curtis' suicide, the opening of the Haçienda club, ascent and demise of Factory Records, Shaun Ryder's famously out-of-control & self destructive shenanigans, all receive special treatment. Through Steve Coogan's excellent performance, Tony Wilson, our guide through this zoo, comes off as a pretty fascinating fellow. Director Michael Winterbottom makes a wise choice in leaving out many details from his private life in favour of the music itself and the people who created it. Wilson's second wife and kids, for example, are barely mentioned - with a cheeky remark about Tony being a minor character in his own life story as an explanation for the lack of on-screen time devoted to them.In the end, whether or not you enjoy '24 Hour Party People' will largely, if not entirely, depend on your level of familiarity or appreciation of the bands like Joy Division, New Order, The Happy Mondays and to a lesser extent of their punk inspirations and predecessors like The Stranglers, The Jam, Buzzcocks, Sex Pistols, Iggy Pop, Siouxsie and the Banshees, who are also depicted in the film.Personally, even though I was always aware of the British new wave, most of its music & 'shtick' pretty much slipped under my radar so I recently started discovering it retroactively. Therefore, it was a blast to see a well-done, interesting film celebrating that era in popular music.

Yes, comedy. There are maybe a total of five horror films that were made in the 80s that are or ever were even slightly frightening, the majority of them, particularly those which remain popular today, are popular because of their comedic value much more than their scariness. Now, I don't mean to badmouth 80s horror or to suggest that these movies are a sustained string of cinematic failures, but you really can't watch something like one of the Nightmares on Elm Street or a Friday the 13th film and afterwards say that you laughed less than you were scared. Okay, so maybe this is just me, but I really think that it can hardly be denied that the comedic content of horror films provide a large part of their overall appeal. And whether you personally agree with me or not, it's not hard to see that John Carpenter agrees.My favorite example of this in They Live is the way Nada (the basically nameless main character) reacts when he first begins to see what the alien beings really look like when he finds those glasses. Personally, I would have kept my visions a little more to myself until I figured out what was going on, but this guy hilariously tells an elderly woman exactly what he thinks of her appearance in the middle of a crowded convenience store. Now, I should probably point out that this is not really something that translates very well into film-review form, you just have to see it for yourself. By explaining it in writing here I feel like Mr. Burns trying to be funny (`We'll have some excellent practically-based jokes!').And then, of course, there is the violence, which is so overdone that it's subsequent humor is nearly unrivaled until Quentin Tarantino came along and made Kill Bill. Nada is a construction worker who is struggling to maintain a job (as are many of the other workers), but desperately needs to show his visions to someone else just to make sure he's not insane. He finds himself wanted by the police (for reasons that I won't explain), and shows up at the construction site where he works to try to get one of his coworkers (also struggling to maintain this job to make ends meet) to try on the glasses. Personally, if I was in that guy's situation I wouldn't want to be getting involved with this apparent nutcase either, especially if I needed that job as badly as he obviously did. Nada is not about to let the guy go until he sees, though, and thus follows The Fight Scene, capitalized for obvious reasons. And by the way, if the guy didn't want to get involved with Nada, it seems like it would have been slightly less troublesome to just look through the glasses and walk away than to get into a full-on kickboxing match with him in broad daylight for half and hour or so.I watched the DVD version of They Live, and I have to say that I was a little disappointed that there was nothing on the DVD about how they did the makeup of the aliens, because I always thought that that was the most interesting part of the movie (besides the fact that the whole control issue so closely resembled the operation of mass media and commercialism in real life). So what you have in They Live is a very interesting premise with a pretty simple delivery, but it works because it's cleverly done and believable, despite the fact that the whole magical sunglasses thing is more something that you might expect to see in a fiction story written by a kid in fourth grade. When I was in fourth grade I wrote a story about a hat that I could put on to make myself invisible, and the conceptual difference is really not that much.They Live is one of those 80s horror\/comedy gems that is widely overlooked, especially today, when massive video chains like Blockbuster have reduced their horror sections to contain little more than the ridiculous crap that Hollywood cranks out and foolishly labels horror films, like Jeepers Creepers (one of the dumbest horror films to come along since I Know What You Did Last Summer) and other such nonsense. Granted, they still carry a few of the good ones - my local Blockbuster still has the original Nosferatu in its horror section, as well as some of the excellent recent horror films like The Ring and Ringu, upon which The Ring was based. And I DID rent They Live from my local Blockbuster, but it was in the DRAMA section. WOW. This is an example of the way that the horror genre has evolved and the way that older horror films have been affected. You would think that if they were going to completely redefine a genre, they would at least have put a movie like They Live in the COMEDY section.

He finds himself wanted by the police (for reasons that I won't explain), and shows up at the construction site where he works to try to get one of his coworkers (also struggling to maintain this job to make ends meet) to try on the glasses. Personally, if I was in that guy's situation I wouldn't want to be getting involved with this apparent nutcase either, especially if I needed that job as badly as he obviously did. Nada is not about to let the guy go until he sees, though, and thus follows The Fight Scene, capitalized for obvious reasons. And by the way, if the guy didn't want to get involved with Nada, it seems like it would have been slightly less troublesome to just look through the glasses and walk away than to get into a full-on kickboxing match with him in broad daylight for half and hour or so.I watched the DVD version of They Live, and I have to say that I was a little disappointed that there was nothing on the DVD about how they did the makeup of the aliens, because I always thought that that was the most interesting part of the movie (besides the fact that the whole control issue so closely resembled the operation of mass media and commercialism in real life). So what you have in They Live is a very interesting premise with a pretty simple delivery, but it works because it's cleverly done and believable, despite the fact that the whole magical sunglasses thing is more something that you might expect to see in a fiction story written by a kid in fourth grade. When I was in fourth grade I wrote a story about a hat that I could put on to make myself invisible, and the conceptual difference is really not that much.They Live is one of those 80s horror\/comedy gems that is widely overlooked, especially today, when massive video chains like Blockbuster have reduced their horror sections to contain little more than the ridiculous crap that Hollywood cranks out and foolishly labels horror films, like Jeepers Creepers (one of the dumbest horror films to come along since I Know What You Did Last Summer) and other such nonsense. Granted, they still carry a few of the good ones - my local Blockbuster still has the original Nosferatu in its horror section, as well as some of the excellent recent horror films like The Ring and Ringu, upon which The Ring was based. And I DID rent They Live from my local Blockbuster, but it was in the DRAMA section. WOW. This is an example of the way that the horror genre has evolved and the way that older horror films have been affected.

","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"9 February 2004","score":"7 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":"  They Live is one of those horror movies that is so scary and so good that it has become a comedy classic. Yes, comedy. There are maybe a total of five horror films that were made in the 80s that are or ever were even slightly frightening, the majority of them, particularly those which remain popular today, are popular because of their comedic value much more than their scariness. Now, I don't mean to badmouth 80s horror or to suggest that these movies are a sustained string of cinematic failures, but you really can't watch something like one of the Nightmares on Elm Street or a Friday the 13th film and afterwards say that you laughed less than you were scared. Okay, so maybe this is just me, but I really think that it can hardly be denied that the comedic content of horror films provide a large part of their overall appeal. And whether you personally agree with me or not, it's not hard to see that John Carpenter agrees.My favorite example of this in They Live is the way Nada (the basically nameless main character) reacts when he first begins to see what the alien beings really look like when he finds those glasses. Personally, I would have kept my visions a little more to myself until I figured out what was going on, but this guy hilariously tells an elderly woman exactly what he thinks of her appearance in the middle of a crowded convenience store. Now, I should probably point out that this is not really something that translates very well into film-review form, you just have to see it for yourself. By explaining it in writing here I feel like Mr. Burns trying to be funny (`We'll have some excellent practically-based jokes!').And then, of course, there is the violence, which is so overdone that it's subsequent humor is nearly unrivaled until Quentin Tarantino came along and made Kill Bill.

The last time, I recall, was in 1974 when it was on one of its many reissues. Shortly afterwards, at Christmas that year, it appeared on TV for the first time. In those video-less days, great movies took that long sometimes to reach the small screen. In the case of 'The Magnificent Seven', made in 1960, it took 14 years, which is the same length of time it took the first James Bond film to reach TV. Don't ask me why I remember all this, but I do. Anyway, this movie was singularly responsible for turning me into a sort of movie buff\/addict\/anorak, or whatever I should be called. I can still recall the first time I saw it, at 'The Ritz' in Brislington (alas, long gone) with my Father. I was about 7. Unfortunately, films in those days ran continuously and you just went in and stayed as long as you wanted. Well, we got there with about 15 minutes to go, and so I saw the climax firstly.

I'm guessing Christian Forte is a fan Mamet fan.

What are they gonna do now?Sound familiar?The movie seems like it's trying to be a combination of the acting workshop, the indie film and the theater.It's the kind of things that actors love--it's kind of like a workshop or a play because it mostly consists of tight focusing on the actors acting... acting angry, tense, scared, conversing, scheming, planning--giving the performers a lot of free range to really ham it all up.A trio of crooks, one leader, one goon, one brother, come up with a big heist scheme... and a monkey wrench is thrown into the works. To top things off, there's a bit of a fender-bender and one of the crooks in flung through the back of the windshield.The cops are on their tail and they stumble into a bar named poetically (and leadenly) Dino's Last Chance.Spacey, as a director, tries to keep the focus on the actors' performances and delivery of dialouge. He pans over to a bright passion-red cigarette ad of a smoking and smoldering Bogart. And he keeps all the violence off-screen, really.I think that was a mistake. Focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie some edge.The problem with the movie is that it moves too slow and suffers from miscasting in almost every role. Matt Dillon (Drugstore Cowboy and Wild Things) seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang.Gary Sinese seems to brooding and deep in thought to be a spineless tag-along with these guys and Joe Mantaga is effective as the traditional routine foul-swearing mad-dog police lieutenant who's all thumbs, but he isn't given anything to really do here.William Fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to spill blood.And the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they try to think of some way out of this.Spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going. The characters are mostly chatting away, trying to think of a plan... and they're to calm and too articulate. There's even a scene where the crooks are playing pool with a whole swarm of armed cops right outside, ready to strike. At one point, one of the crooks even call the police who are right outside the bar. Oh brother. Oh bother.These cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up. Shouldn't the holed-up crooks be a little scared, a little uneasy? Meanwhile, all the real action is happening inside.Someone whips out a gun, a baseball bat, which leads to an ugly confrontation off-screen and there's one more casualty that happens that's... well, kinda sad. But...Faye Dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach, improving on her New Orleans accent. Skeet Ullrich is fine in a smaller part.A cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look. And so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear windshield. The dialouge is obviously trying to go for a David Mamet approach and it's as profane, but never as realistic or as insightful. I'm guessing Christian Forte is a fan Mamet fan. The movie feels like too much of what it really is... a really low-budget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script that's not bad, but needs a few more re-writes. Spacey shows he's not a terrible director, but he lacks a sort of feel for shaping a movie and it feels like he's just filming actors act.These actors are all talented and could work with the material, but they all feel out of place. As I said before, the movie really suffers from miscasting. I don't mean that the wrong actors were cast. I think they found just the right cast, but placed them in all the wrong roles. I think switching some of the roles would've helped immensely.Having veteran mob actor Joe Mantagna play the leader of the pack, Gary Sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking at his troops, keeping Fischter in his bloodthirsty goon part and Matt Dillion as the sacrificial lamb. That would have been a big improvement.When some actors direct, it works. They can even win Oscars for it. But a lot of the time, when actors direct, they have a tendency to just focus on the performances. Just shoot the actors acting.Sometimes it works... but they need a good showcase for it. An excuse for it.Hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like coming-of-age stories so it's only natural that movies about them will go from point A to point B as well.There are a few really great entries into this genre.' Spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations The Negotiator.This certainly won't become a cult classic, let alone one of AFI's 100. Still, it does have a few nice moments and personal touches, but in the end, it's instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular TV. It's just not worth going out of your way to see.I give a 3 out of 10. Spacey's other directorial credit, Beyond The Sea was reportedly a better effort. Hmmm... maybe it's true.

Get Real comes a close second.The young actors that play Jamie and Ste do an extraordinary job sometimes forgetting how well they pull off such complex characters throughout the movie.  I think any gay man growing up can relate to Jamie. He doesn't excel in sports, and almost too smart for his own mother.  He is comfortable with his sexuality, and he doesn't give a damn what the world thinks of him.  Ste, on the other hand, fears his older brother, and his father made his life miserable. As he states in the film, they made me ugly. Ste is not all ugly, and Jamie realizes this, and is attracted to his brash, manly demeanor. Unfortunately, Ste's own demons and his insecurities are present throughout the film.  At one point, Ste ashamed of rumors of his questionable sexuality, denies it to a heartbroken Jamie.Obviously, I enjoyed this movie. The scenes between Jamie and his mother and likewise, between Jamie and Ste, are perhaps the best parts of the movie. I understand having Leah in the movie to provide the supporting role of comic relief was a necessity in most film requirements, but in this one, it distracted the viewer to an extent.

The story was well constructed, although there were several plot holes that only really became apparent as we talked about it on the way home. For me the main problem was the last three quarters of an hour, where the pace was allowed to slip, and there was a little too much explaining being done. I'm sure Spielberg did this so as not to fall into the same trap as the original version of Blade Runner, also based on a Philip K Dick story, which proved to be baffling to a great deal of the audience. There was also some rather alarming similarities to the noir classic L. A. Confidential, which I won't give away here in case you haven't seen it.Having said all this, I would still recommend this film, as it is a cut above the usual multiplex fare, and shows that after almost thirty years in the business, Spielberg is still a director full of suprises.

It may have been the 4 stars the Radio Times gave it, or maybe the 'cool' write up it received.Although the story was ok, the music does not suit the film whatsoever. I felt I should have been watching it whilst wearing some denim and mullet wig. In any horse riding or action scene or scene-interlude a high electric guitar would spark up almost willing the viewer to start air guitarring. The music reminded me a little of Dune, although it shows how well received Andrew Powell was with a such a small CV to his name.-*PLOT. SPOILER WITHIN*-Basically, Philippe 'the mouse' Gaston (Broderick) escapes from prison, and for no reason, Ex-Captain Navarre (Hauer) befriends him. Hauer wears allot of black and has a hawk and a ridiculous sword. The main element of the story is that the evil bishop (McKern) in a jealous rage curses two lovers (Hauer and Pfeiffer). By day Hauer is human and Pfeiffer is a hawk, and by night it's the other way around, except Hauer is a Wolf. So you see, the two can never be together. They eventually both get to be human again in an eclipse, kill the bishop and everyone is happy with the curse broken.-*PLOT OVER*-I'm lost as to why Broderick is even in the film, as his only role seems to be to open a door for Hauer at the end. I am also lost as to why the film is so highly rated??

The main special effect (for the transformation scenes) is a kind of half fade to the sunset and some blurred images.

They should have stopped with Mary Poppins. Pete is a young lad who's run away from the family that bought him(I think it may have been from an orphanage, details are sketchy)as their own personal slave.  It seems Pete has taken up residence in a cave with the animated Dragon, Elliot(voice by Charlie Callas), who is also Pete's best and only friend.  Only Pete can see the dragon because Elliott has this habit of making himself invisible whenever anyone but Pete is around.  This also helped conveniently cut down on animation costs as well.  I mention this because Pete's Dragon is also notable for the film that caused Don Bluth(animation director), who wasn't too pleased with the restraints of working on Pete's Dragon, to leave Disney and strike out on his own.  Then again it could be Elliott just wants to hide from this mess of a film.Nora(Helen Reddy), owns and operates a nearby lighthouse with her father Lampie(Mickey Rooney).  Her husband, you see, has been lost at sea, so owning and operating a lighthouse is a good occupation for her if he ever decides to journey home.  The lighthouse also enables songwriters Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn to throw in a song, so when Nora sings I'll be your candle on the water we are aware of it's double meaning.  Cute.Of course, Nora finds Pete, and takes him into her home.  Since she can't see Elliott, we know that Nora will spend most of the film thinking Pete's invisible dragon is an imaginary playmate made up by Pete because he has no real family.  Stir into all this the villainous Dr. Terminus(Jim Dale), who believes there is a dragon and wants to capture him for his own nefarious purposes.  If that's not enough villainy for you, there's the Grogans headed by Lena Grogan(Shelley Winters) who owns Pete and comes looking for their lost property.  Having made her big screen debut three years earlier in a silly role as a nun in Airport 75, Helen Reddy tries to extend her acting chops in this film.  She doesn't extend them very well, and the less said about it the better.  As for her vocal talents, Reddy managed some good pop hits with songs like I Am Woman, Delta Dawn and Angie Baby, but her range is limited, and the awful songs she is given here only emphasize that fact.The adults aren't the only offenders in this film.  Sean Marshall as Pete demonstrates no acting ability, no singing ability, and isn't cute enough that we care to let those deficiencies slide by. In a duet called Boobob bobbob bob (I love you too) that he sings with Elliot, Elliot clearly overshadows him even though he's only required to sing the Boobob bobbob bob line.Jim Dale is wicked enough as Dr. Terminus I suppose, though he plays it way over the top which seems to be a prerequisite of being a villain in a Disney film.  You'll find his shtick more than a little annoying after a few minutes of his screen time.There are a few good things in this film.  The animated Elliot steals every scene he is in.  When he is on the screen is about the only time the film comes alive.  The film would have been a lot more fun and immensely more whimsical if they had done away with the invisibility bit and given the dragon more screen time.  Since the film is called Pete's Dragon, one would have thought that would be a no brainer.Shelley Winters seems to be having a lot of fun as the villain Lena Grogan.  Next to Elliot, she gives the best performance of anyone associated with this production.  She also has the best musical number in the film with a little ditty called Bill of Sale.  I would have voted to can Dr. Terminus and just have the film center around Lena and the Grogans as being the villains.  Mickey Rooney as Lampie isn't too awful, playing the kind of outlandish character Mickey Rooney can do well.  Let's face it, if it were Mickey Rooney playing Mickey Rooney we wouldn't have minded because that would have been infinitely more fun than anything else going on in this debacle.  Maybe Lampie should have told his daughter Nora to get out of the house and get a life before the film started.  Red Buttons as Hoagy, plays the same Red Buttons character he plays in almost every film since Sayonara.  Everybody else in this film is there for window dressing.As for the rest of the musical numbers, besides the ones I mentioned earlier, they are painful to listen to and sit through.  How painful?  They would make a Barney song sound like Beethoven.  If you have a child watching this film, they'll be entertained during those few moments when Elliot is on the screen.  When he is not, they may become restless and revolt.  Come to think of it, that about sums it up for adult viewers too.My Grade D             ","genre":null},{"date":"9 February 2004","score":"7 out of 16 people found the following review useful","review":"  After having found success in earlier films such as Mary Poppins and Bedknobs And Broomsticks mixing live action with animation and musical numbers, Disney foisted this tale of a boy named Pete(Sean Marshall) and his Magic Dragon on us.

However, to me what this film wants to say is not just to have more pleasurable sex but to look out and take good care of your desires!!  This film illustrates lots of examples why and here I came up with 3 of them.1. A beautiful, unforgettable, careless sex with Lorenzo, Elena became pregnant and fascinated by that sex she once had.  She wanted to leave the man she's with now and what's more, she wanted to find her child's father even though her child's father is a total mystery to her, no name, no address, not to mention what her child's father did for a living.

While Lorezo, the father, and Belen, the babysitter, were aroused by their desires and attempting to have sex, Luna, the daughter, was attacked by a fierce dog and found dead.  How ironic, Luna was created by the sex and destroyed also by the sex.3.

For example, if you don't like the life you have now, you can get into the imagining hole to start all over again as the writer, Lorezo suggested.

I don't think I've ever been so disappointed with anything in my life.Even taken as a separate film, it's a complete chore to watch - the plot is minimal, the story jumps around and the characters are so badly developed that you find yourself not really giving a hoot what happens to any of them. Most of them are irritating, especially Tank Girl herself who is thoroughly punchable (and as many people have already pointed out, she spends the whole film making uncomfortably unfunny wisecracks).As an adaptation, it stinks. Tank Girl should be a nihilistic loudmouth Australian, burping and farting and starting fights, not a yappy perky American who likes little kids. Sub Girl and Jet Girl are nothing like their comic counterparts and neither are the kangaroos. I imagine if they'd tried to portray all the characters as they were in the comics, they'd have never got the script past the studio execs.I foolishly paid to see this in the cinema and came close to walking out - I only stayed to see if there was anything good about it at all. The only things of note were the sand showers, the little machine that sucks water out of people as it kills them and the Bjork song on the soundtrack.A few years later I tried to watch it again, hoping that maybe I was wrong first time round.

Tank Girl should be a nihilistic loudmouth Australian, burping and farting and starting fights, not a yappy perky American who likes little kids. Sub Girl and Jet Girl are nothing like their comic counterparts and neither are the kangaroos. I imagine if they'd tried to portray all the characters as they were in the comics, they'd have never got the script past the studio execs.I foolishly paid to see this in the cinema and came close to walking out - I only stayed to see if there was anything good about it at all. The only things of note were the sand showers, the little machine that sucks water out of people as it kills them and the Bjork song on the soundtrack.A few years later I tried to watch it again, hoping that maybe I was wrong first time round. I turned it off after 20 minutes, I couldn't stand any more than that.If you are one of the tiny number of people that used to buy Deadline in the early 90s and somehow missed this film, save yourself and don't bother. It'll only spoil your memories of Tanky.If you're a passing filmgoer, watch something else. Anything else.  ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi"}]
