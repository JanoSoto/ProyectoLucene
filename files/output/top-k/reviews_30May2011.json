Almodorav has managed to put together a movie with a strong emotional core all the while making some interesting stylistic choices. At the heart of this movie is a story of a mother come to terms with the recent death of her only son on his 17th birthday. We see her give up her life in Madrid as a nurse and return to Barcelona where she had a more tumultuous life before moving to Madrid.The movie does an excellent job establishing the relationship between the mother and the son so when the son dies one can really feel the emotional impact. This is where we first see Cecilia Roth shine in the role of Manuela. We are really able to feel that this is a difficult time in her life and that when she decides to pick up and start her life over we understand. When she gets to Barcelona we are immediately thrust into the underworld and are introduced to Antonia San Juan who does an excellent playing Manuela's old friend a pre-op transvestite. She does come off as being a bit over the top at times, but is never out of character. There is a scene where Agrado was given the opportunity to put on a one women show she seems to drop the ball and a scene with a lot of potential was fairly tame. My biggest problem with the movie is the relationship between Penelope Cruz's character, Rosa, and Manuela. I was confused on how Rosa came to trust Manuela so completely so quickly. I do not think that Cruz did anything special with the character, which was unfortunate because she is such an important part of the story of Manuela. Since this movie is about Manuela as a mother and since she adopts Rosa's baby, when she dies in child birth, it is disappointing that there was not more of a connection between Roth and Cruz on screen. I did love some of the transition shots used and the one at the end with the train going from Barcelona and then back again was neat. These type of shots along with the soundtrack keeps this movie from being too boring and not just a rehashing of the same story. Also I like the almost meta aspect of the theater production of A Streetcar Name Desire. I enjoyed how it was interwoven into the story and how the actress and the story play itself became a part of Manuela's growth. Watching her take care of the principle actresses and Rosa allowed the viewer to never lose track of what made Manuela a mother. Overall this movie was extremely well put together, but there were weaknesses to be had. At times the movie lost focus on Manuela and focused a bit too much on Agrado or Rosa's stories. It was a fresh take on what normally would have been a boring and bland Oscar bait movie.

Blade was the first serious modern superhero film, but X-Men was the one that made them popular. For the first time since they stopped making Superman films, audiences got to see heroes using superpowers fighting others with superpowers.The film was also one of the first to deal with some deep themes. It is in no way a simple good guy versus bad guy story that usually populates the genre. Magneto is every bit as developed, interesting, and sympathetic as the heroes. Possibly, more so. And Singer is able to use his own experiences being a homosexual to enhance the mutant problems so that it becomes an excellent allegory for current events that still remains true to the vast comic book history.The story is presented as an origin story, but it's not like the numerous other origin stories. Like Blade and Tim Burton's Batman, they're already heroes and can start with the action right away. The Wolverine-Rogue relationship works wonderfully. I don't quite know why they didn't just use Jubilee as it is in the comics, but Rogue works just fine. The Logan-Jean-Scott love triangle starts off great, though I wish they went further with it in the sequels. Though the really terrific relationship is the Xavier-Magneto friendship-turned-rivalry which out shines everyone else. It really added a whole other dimension to the movie that, quite honestly, no other superhero movie has been able to match.The movie does have a bit too much exposition. Sure there is a lot needed to be explained, but there are a few too many sections of the movie where it's just long speeches by Jean, Xavier, etc. There is plenty of action, more than many other origin movies, and they all work well that you can forgive the long exposition.The movie is nearly perfectly cast. Wolverine, Xavier, Magneto, Jean, Rogue, and Senator Kelly are exactly like they are in the comics. Now, I can hardly read the comics without thinking of their voices to match the dialogue. Mystique is good, but she is better in the sequel. I liked Cyclops, though he has progressively less to do in the sequels which is disappointing since he is such an interesting character. Storm is fine here, but Berry's subsequent rise to fame and insistence on more screen time drags down later movies. I loved Mane as Sabretooth, but the character is given so little to do and honestly he was portrayed more interestingly and faithfully in the Wolverine movie.The movie isn't just a terrific superhero movie, but a great movie in general. Singer really goes above in beyond in his two X-Men movie, that it's a real shame the next two had to be so overstuffed with characters that everyone became uninteresting.

Anchored by a career defining performance by Cate Blanchett the viewer is swept into England at a time of turmoil and uncertainty and are given a unique perspective as one of the most powerful people in history comes to power.I really love how the writers chose to spend most of the movie showing Elizabeth as being human being with frailties and insecurities. I also enjoyed seeing her in love, but this ends up being the only weak point in the movie for me. It is mainly because I am cynical and do not buy into that type of undying love that Lord Robert and Elizabeth share with each other. That might just be me being cynical or that love at the time meant something complete different and I just cannot relate to it. It is probably because I am cynical. Other than this there are almost no faults with the movie.One could spend pages talking about how good Blanchett is in this, but she gives us a remarkable transformation of a doe-eyed love struck girl to one of the most powerful and formidable images of power ever caught on film. Watching her psyching her self up in the mirror and then go out in Parliament and getting what she wanted was a fantastic one-two combination that really captures the transition that Elizabeth had to go through to become the leader of an entire country. Together with an impressive supporting cast we get to see Attenborough play a role that he almost always seems to play, but plays it so well. He plays a man with nothing but good intentions in his heart while being misguided at times. Eccleston does a fantastic job of being a villain while doing almost nothing villainous. We honestly believe that he is doing everything for the good of his country, while never losing his villainous streak. Rush does a good job as her mysterious adviser and at the end I love how his intentions are made clear, but you are still not sure if you should trust him. I also loved seeing Cassel playing a character so far from what I have seen him in before. I loved picking out various actors and actress that I recognized from all over the place in small roles. One of the most impressive parts for me was the sets. I honestly could not tell you if there were actually sets or castles that they shot on. Either way they are impressive and I was truly awestruck at some massiveness of some of the sets. As mentioned before the costumes were especially effective. I loved seeing Elizabeth going from simple dresses to some of the more impressive costumes I have ever seen, while never being out of character. In the end this movie is one of the most impressive period pieces I have ever seen while at the same time being one of the most interesting character studies of a historical figure I have ever seen. With a timeless performance by Blanchett this movie is really a treat for any fan of film.

It seems that someone on the satellite menu always has Kelly's Heroes playing during this weekend.Before I review, some disclosure my first viewing of this movie was particularly memorable for me. I saw it at the Rudder Theater at Texas A&M University in 1978. Most of the other people viewing the movie were members of the Aggie Corps of Cadets. Now I don't know if things are still the same at A&M, but back in '78, the Corps added their own very memorable soundtrack of cheers, boos and hisses to every war movie that was shown at Rudder. This was no exception. Watching Kelly's Heroes at Rudder Theater at Texas A&M in 1978 was the same sort of experience as seeing the Rocky Horror Picture Show at the Nuart Theater in Venice, California in the mid-70's you had to have been there. It was an EXPERIENCE. The audience didn't watch the show, the audience participated in the show.Now that I've got that off my chest, here's the review I love this movie, but it is not for people who want to see a movie that treats the war experience with either grimth or reverence. This is not a serious war movie, it is not faithful to history, and it is not going to give you the warm fuzzies about anything.So why watch it? Because it is straight-up FUNNY and watchable, that's why! And it has a young Clint Eastwood in it. My god, now that he's old and all his recent movies have him as an old guy, it's easy to forget that when he was young, he was one good-looking dude! As the hero of this movie, playing the title role of Kelly, he is sooooo easy to watch.And the other actors Telly Savalas. Don Rickles. Donald Sutherland. Carroll O'Connor. These guys are GOOD, and if you're too young to remember them as young and to have seen them acting in their prime, this is a good movie to bring you up to speed on them.The plot is a straightforward caper movie it's near the end of WWII, the defeat of the Germans is a foregone conclusion, it's just a matter of how and when their capitulation will take place. For most of the troops involved on both sides, at this point the major concern is not getting killed in some unimportant final action as the war winds down. And, if opportunity presents itself, in picking up the pieces of spoils that are available in the chaos and confusion of the end.It's in this disorganized situation that Kelly, a former Lieutenant busted to Private to take the rap for incompetence in the command above his level, finds out that in a town some miles away and behind German lines from where he and his men are stationed, there is a bank that is the repository for a truckload of German gold. Long story short Kelly and his buddies figure that they're going to go for the gold and get something out of the war for themselves.The movie skewers war movies in a gentle way, and it also takes the opportunity to send up the spaghetti western genre that Eastwood did so well. Donald Sutherland's character, Oddball, bears mentioning as a real anachronism. Oddball is a hippie ahead of his time, and if you find this sort of thing jarring, you're not going to like his character.

The big corporate world again and the corrupting effect of urban life in the early sixties &#x85; Joe perceives his role as one of a 'legitimate pimp', a lucidity shared with Kirsten Arensen, the young office secretary, tired of playing the same motherly role for her boss who just needs her to be there. Kirsten, the beautiful Lee Remick, drowns her frustration by benignly nourishing her body with chocolates and her mind with encyclopedia books and contemplating water, trying to find parcels of beauty in the world &#x85; the film's darker tones are almost imperceptible.Mutual frustration creates mutual attraction and the whole starter of the relationship between Joe and Kirsten is their aversion for their lives. As viewers, we are so enchanted by Lemmon and Remick's growing love that we unconsciously overlook that there is something already corrupted, not in the love's sincerity, but in the medium that drives this sincerity. The first time Joe declares his love, he's drunk and Kirsten euphoric after a chocolate-based cocktail drunk for the first time. They do love each other, but not in a disinterested way, Joe needs Kirsten to express his jolly side and let the entire bad mood get out of his chest. He's natural, and she likes that, she who used to live with strict parents, and couldn't communicate with his father after her mother's death. Kirsten found in Joe, the positive pole of a depressing life, a true complicity poignantly incarnated by their inspiring toast meaning Together in Heaven in Norwegian, words that Joe's too drunk to utter correctly ... premonition?The pivotal part of the film opens when Joe's transferred to another client, not to be the pimp delivering girls for yacht parties, but a follower whose new associate's drinking habits will disastrously affect his life to the point he will always go back home drunk. One night, after finding Kirsten quietly rocking their daughter Debbie, to sleep, singing a quiet lullaby, he cracks up. In a heart-breaking monologue, Joe shouts his need for finding Kirsten on the same wavelength. Like her previous boss, he needs her to be there. Kirsten's acceptance starts the infernal spiral leading to their downfall. This part crucially mirrors the predispositions of both Joe and Kirsten to alcoholism, and the movie is incredibly ahead of its time in the transparent way it tackles the subject.Indeed, Kirsten accepts less out of love for Joe than for alcohol, her drinking in order to please him is as convenient as his dedication to his job is 'zealous' and this mess inevitably leads to the Kirsten accidentally setting the house on fire and Joe being fired. They become bums, boozers and losers with a realistic touch I didn't even found in Leaving Las Vegas where the romantic aspect prevailed despite the tragedy. No romance here, only the tragedy of addiction devouring the body and the mind of Joe and Kirsten, together ... in hell. And the movie shines in the acting department as both leads literally blew me away. I rank Jack Lemmon's performance as equal to Ray Milland in The Lost Weekend or Ellen Burstyn in Requiem for a Dream. The part where he's looking for the hidden bottle, going from joy, to confusion, to anger, to rage and despair, such a wide range of emotions in one single scene should have earned him the Oscar in 1962, despite the competitiveness of the year.The movie is a powerful illustration of both addictions' devastating effects and its unsuspected roots. And by powerful, I mean intelligent, because it showed a subtlety too often ignored, that sometimes, we enjoy a drug within another habit. When you can't have a coffee without smoking or enjoying something without a 'starter', a substance to accompany you&#x85; believing these consumptions are indispensable to drive the enjoyment or the pleasure. And this is the sad originality in Joe and Kirsten's relationships; they needed each other to shamelessly express the dependence inhabiting their lives. The perversity is that they ended up only loving themselves as drunkards, as Joe said, they were not a couple, but a threesome.This could be highlighted by the painful rehab scenes where Joe shouts for his wife. We wonder if he's missing Kirsten or booze. The movie is audaciously violent and concludes in a mood in total opposition with the start. Joe tries to recover, inspired by a powerful desire to provide a good life for Debbie. He's helped by Jack Klugman as Jim Hungerford from the Alcoholic Anonyms, a performance I would have appreciated to see nominated, along with Charles Bickford as Ellis, Kirsten's unfortunate father who witnesses the decline of his little girl.Speaking of Ellis, the ending of the film is a clever reminder of one of the questions he asked Joe, what would he do if a X Company did something bad and Joe almost implied that he would try to hide it or makes it look good. Ironically, this perfectly sums up what addiction is about finding excuses such as enjoying life, forgetting the problems etc., while all you need is the strength to admit your dependence and the guts to fight it. Joe is almost cured but Kirsten still can't imagine living without alcohol. She still needs it not to be depressed by the world's ugliness.The fight is not over Kirsten, not even for Joe, not even for Jim, not even for all of us who try to fight our inner demons and say Life is beautiful without the bitter taste of booze in our mouths &#x85; ","genre":null},{"date":"30 May 2011","score":"","review":" The true essence of addiction is masterfully depicted in Blake Edwards' Days of Wine and Roses, a movie starting with a misleading comedic mood reminding of Bill Wilder's Apartment.

Ironically, this perfectly sums up what addiction is about finding excuses such as enjoying life, forgetting the problems etc., while all you need is the strength to admit your dependence and the guts to fight it. Joe is almost cured but Kirsten still can't imagine living without alcohol. She still needs it not to be depressed by the world's ugliness.The fight is not over Kirsten, not even for Joe, not even for Jim, not even for all of us who try to fight our inner demons and say Life is beautiful without the bitter taste of booze in our mouths &#x85; ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"30 May 2011","score":"","review":" The true essence of addiction is masterfully depicted in Blake Edwards' Days of Wine and Roses, a movie starting with a misleading comedic mood reminding of Bill Wilder's Apartment. Indeed, Jack Lemmon in another role perfectly fir for him, portrays an average Joe whose name is Clay, a Public Relations manager. The big corporate world again and the corrupting effect of urban life in the early sixties &#x85; Joe perceives his role as one of a 'legitimate pimp', a lucidity shared with Kirsten Arensen, the young office secretary, tired of playing the same motherly role for her boss who just needs her to be there. Kirsten, the beautiful Lee Remick, drowns her frustration by benignly nourishing her body with chocolates and her mind with encyclopedia books and contemplating water, trying to find parcels of beauty in the world &#x85; the film's darker tones are almost imperceptible.Mutual frustration creates mutual attraction and the whole starter of the relationship between Joe and Kirsten is their aversion for their lives. As viewers, we are so enchanted by Lemmon and Remick's growing love that we unconsciously overlook that there is something already corrupted, not in the love's sincerity, but in the medium that drives this sincerity. The first time Joe declares his love, he's drunk and Kirsten euphoric after a chocolate-based cocktail drunk for the first time. They do love each other, but not in a disinterested way, Joe needs Kirsten to express his jolly side and let the entire bad mood get out of his chest. He's natural, and she likes that, she who used to live with strict parents, and couldn't communicate with his father after her mother's death. Kirsten found in Joe, the positive pole of a depressing life, a true complicity poignantly incarnated by their inspiring toast meaning Together in Heaven in Norwegian, words that Joe's too drunk to utter correctly ... premonition?The pivotal part of the film opens when Joe's transferred to another client, not to be the pimp delivering girls for yacht parties, but a follower whose new associate's drinking habits will disastrously affect his life to the point he will always go back home drunk. One night, after finding Kirsten quietly rocking their daughter Debbie, to sleep, singing a quiet lullaby, he cracks up. In a heart-breaking monologue, Joe shouts his need for finding Kirsten on the same wavelength. Like her previous boss, he needs her to be there. Kirsten's acceptance starts the infernal spiral leading to their downfall. This part crucially mirrors the predispositions of both Joe and Kirsten to alcoholism, and the movie is incredibly ahead of its time in the transparent way it tackles the subject.Indeed, Kirsten accepts less out of love for Joe than for alcohol, her drinking in order to please him is as convenient as his dedication to his job is 'zealous' and this mess inevitably leads to the Kirsten accidentally setting the house on fire and Joe being fired. They become bums, boozers and losers with a realistic touch I didn't even found in Leaving Las Vegas where the romantic aspect prevailed despite the tragedy.

The children discover an old treasure map that supposedly leads to a fortune in precious stones and jewelery and so they go looking for it to save their homes.A very basic premise, but that isn't the only source of the film's appeal.

The characters Mikey, Mouth, Data, Chunk etc are all lovable and are played wonderfully by some of the best child actors ever. Sean Astin (Lord of the Rings) and Corey Feldman (Stand By Me) especially. The other characters are very likable and all deliver great performances In combination with a likable cast of characters and a dire situation, The Goonies has a strong adventurous quality that cannot be easily replicated in a film such as this. The comedic value, although often very cheesy, is very high, notably the antics of Chunk.You'd think that I grew up with this movie considering the positive comments I have about it, but I really didn't. I only saw the film a year ago and instantly fell in love with it. It's a film that perfectly reminds us of the wonders of childhood and why children should appreciate the limited moments they have. It's also a film that manages to cheer me up regardless of how upset I may feel. Because of this, The Goonies demands infinite rewatches.It does sadden me that my parents never exposed me to The Goonies as a child, but I know that after experiencing it again and again, I will not make the same mistake and I sincerely hope that after reading my review that you will do the same. The creative minds of both Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon, Superman, The Omen) and Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Schindler's List) should be praised.The Goonies is a film that takes you out of a complicated world, spiritually transports you back to childhood and entertains you marvelously from the opening scene to the end credits. I love this movie and if you're willing to lighten up, I'm sure you will too.

All coming together to make something greater than the sum of the parts.I was very, very lucky to experience Rocky Horror in that way. ","genre":"Comedy, Musical"}]
