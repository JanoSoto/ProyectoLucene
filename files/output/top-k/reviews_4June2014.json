It is a very sensitive film based upon a novel published in 1985 (of the same title) by the well-known American novelist Anne Tyler (born 1941), a denizen of Baltimore. The characters of this novel are also from Baltimore, which some regard as the Centre of the Earth, by which I refer primarily to those innocents who have not seen THE WIRE (2002, see my review). William Hurt gives one of his brilliant performances (which seem to come so naturally to him) as Macon Leary, an up-tight and hopelessly stuffy author of travel guides for Americans who do not like to leave America and wish to travel in their bubble, thus protecting themselves from all contaminating influences such as foreigners or even people from another city such as Philadelphia. But to give an idea of how hopeless an isolationist Leary is, we see him eating disgusting hamburgers at a Burger King in Paris, which he will in turn recommend to his readers. Leary will guide timorous Americans to Burger Kings and other such horrible places wherever they are in the world, so that they need never eat anything strange. In a voice-over in this film, he says of French restaurants and their menus of the day 'Avoid Prix Fixe. It forces you to eat all those courses you don't want.' One presumes that Tyler is being gently satirical in inventing this character (let us hope he never really existed and is a caricature). Leary's series of books are called 'The Accidental Tourist', hence the title of the film. And as for Leary himself, he is an accidental tourist of Life. Meanwhile, Leary's accidentally toured life has been devastated by the death of his only son, and he has been savaged by grief. His wife, played by Kathleen Turner, leaves him at the beginning of the story to live in a separate flat and go her own way, as she says he has not yet come to terms with his grief and she can no longer live with him. Thus, he lives alone in his house with the most charming actor in the film, a dog called Bud, who plays the dog in the film. I would greatly like to have Bud come and live with me! However, as the film was made 26 years ago, perhaps he is no longer about. I like all dog films, and this to a larger extent than one might imagine is a dog film. It is Bud's lack of good behaviour which brings Leary into contact with the charmingly eccentric character Muriel (whom Leary later describes as 'that odd girl'), who is a dog trainer, and who becomes his romantic muse and saviour. This character is played by the wonderfully odd actress Geena Davis, one of my favourites. The film she made just before this one, in the same year, was EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY (1988, see my review), which I think of as one of the funniest films ever made, and Davis's central performance in it made it work. Never having met Davis, I can only presume that in order to play these wacky and offbeat characters to such perfection, she must be pretty odd herself. However, she rid herself of these anomalies when she played the President of the United States in the excellent TV series COMMANDER IN CHIEF (2005), in which her performance was, well, 'commanding', and it won her a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a TV drama. It is a great pity that the rather weird and wonderful Geena Davis has not made many more films than she has, but she won a well deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST, which shows that she has been appreciated by her peers (as do her countless other awards). She also resembles the goddess Diana (aka Artemis) in that she is an archery champion, and having been married four times, she clearly takes good aim at the heart. If she were ever to 'come up to see me sometime', I could show her my long bow which my grandfather lovingly carved out of lemonwood from South America because he said it had the best qualities (his idea being that he would be making the Stradivarius of long bows). No mere yew for him! Long bows are so much more romantic than etchings. Another excellent actress who appears in this film is Amy Wright, who does a brilliant job of portraying Leary's eccentric sister Rose. The film is essentially a study of people who 'don't fit'. Sometimes they don't fit in a good way and sometimes they don't fit in a bad way. So Tyler seems to be excavating the American psyche to find divergences from the norm, which is an important thing to do in a country where 'normality' ranks second only the 'the dollar' theologically speaking. This film was directed by the highly talented Lawrence Kasdan, who knows a good nuance when he sees one. And in this film we see plenty of them.

This is quite a good film. And it's probably the best heist film I have seen. Tension and suspense are maximized during a 28-minute segment in the middle when there is no dialogue of any kind ... what an accomplishment.The opening third of the film is almost as good, as we meet the four crooks, led by Tony (Jean Servais), a man just out of prison, but one who cares about his friends and is especially fond of kids. One by one, the other three crooks are introduced, and each contributes his expertise in the planning and preparation, leading up to the actual heist. At a chic nightclub called The Age Of Gold, we meet Viviane (Magali Noel), a tall, stylish singer with big lips whose stage show includes the song Rififi, a word used to describe the danger of streetwise tough guys and their risky, outlaw pursuits; how appropriate.But Viviane's sexiness leads to a situation that causes problems for the four guys, and this plot turn occupies the final third of the film. At nearly two hours the film is a bit long. And this final section, somewhat tedious, might have benefited by a few scenes being shortened. The ending neatly wraps everything up with what is probably the only conclusion that would have been acceptable to an audience in 1955.The B&W lighting is terrific. With lots of wet streets and no sunshine, outdoor visuals convey a grayish tone throughout, consistent with the film's theme. Side lighting contributes a noir atmosphere in some indoor scenes. The score, especially at the beginning, suggests an element of danger and a noir atmosphere of chic sophistication.

The plot is monstrously complicated, but really doesn't assume too much importance; what matters more is to savor the atmosphere created by Nicholas Musuraca's camera, as it tracks moodily round a series of dingy interiors that contrast starkly with the bright light of Jeff Bailey's (Robert Mitchum's) gas station. In this world there are no such concepts as good and evil the characters are perpetually out to exploit one another. Jeff might be considered the hero of the film, but his motives are often questionable - although he does not actually commit murder, he becomes involved in a series of plots initiated by Whit (Kirk Douglas), and subsequently tries to double-cross him. Mitchum's performance is pure film noir - clad in dirty raincoat and battered hat, he is the epitome of cool, only becoming emotional when really necessary. He has to work hard for our attention, however, particularly in the scenes with Kathie (Jane Greer), whose motives can never be trusted. Alternately manipulative and winsome, she has the capacity to twist any man - Jeff included - round her little finger. Her verbal tussles with Jeff are one of the film's highlights whenever we think that Jeff has the measure of her, she eludes him. In this kind of universe, good characters like Ann (Virginia Huston) have little chance of survival; despite the fact that her love for Jeff remains constant, she can never stay close to him. The action of OUT OF THE PAST (BUILD MY GALLOWS HIGH in the UK) starts slowly, but then builds to a compelling climax in which there are no winners.

In a way, the JP series evokes 19th c. notions of humanity's dominion over the earth, especially once the T-Rex starts roaring. In a movie like this, we revert to hunter-gatherers huddled around our safe fires while the megafauna roam dangerously about. Kill the evil dinosaurs! However, the exposition at the start was too long and most of the dialogue was not well written. There were various plot developments that seemed contrived or didn't seem right for other reasons. (For example, the ship ending exactly at the appointed spot despite having no crew.) Annoyingly, characters did obviously stupid things in various scenes (eg walk off from the group for some distance just to take a wee).

The dinosaurs were spectacular, and that is what we all flocked to these movies to see. As expected, there were several elaborate nail-biting scenes with characters in extremis because of the various carnivorous and vicious dinos. At times, the jungle scenes were even beautiful and evocative (I'm thinking now of the tiny dinosaurs scampering through the sun-lit riverbed).I enjoyed the first movie much more. This sequel lacked the magical quality of the first blockbuster. This sequel emphasised more how dangerous the dinosaurs are. Don't f*ck with mother nature because mother nature will f*ck with you. In a way, the JP series evokes 19th c. notions of humanity's dominion over the earth, especially once the T-Rex starts roaring. In a movie like this, we revert to hunter-gatherers huddled around our safe fires while the megafauna roam dangerously about. Kill the evil dinosaurs! However, the exposition at the start was too long and most of the dialogue was not well written. There were various plot developments that seemed contrived or didn't seem right for other reasons. (For example, the ship ending exactly at the appointed spot despite having no crew.) Annoyingly, characters did obviously stupid things in various scenes (eg walk off from the group for some distance just to take a wee). The writers tried to make environmentalism a theme here, but this crashed and burned once the T-Rexes and velociraptors started doing their thing. The end game in San Diego should have gone into a separate movie.The acting by Goldblum and Moore was fine. They each have their own distinctive styles, which they brought to their parts. But to be honest of these actors are too good for a movie like this. Goldblum was stuck in his nature will find a way mode; Moore was his let me pet the baby dino foil. Moore was 37 when this was shot, but looks younger. Goldblum was significantly older. I didn't really see the two of them together, so their arguing scenes felt off to me. Kelly's character (the black daughter) didn't work for me at all.These two Jurassic Park movies were released in the mid-1990s, when America was the sole-standing superpower reaping the benefit of winning the Cold War, 9\/11 hadn't happened yet, and the financial troubles to come were barely even on the horizon. American was on a high, and everyone was raking it in. Those were the days! Our troubles were confined, although if this movie is to be believed they had already been loose and were ready to destroy San Diego.

An hour into it I found myself with my head down tugging at my hair and groaning loudly. This sounds a bit childish so I will elaborate. 'Cops and Robbersons' is a terribly unfunny movie made by talented people who have made excellent films and stars actors who have made me laugh in the past so it is frustrating when I see them entrenched in a laughless screenplay. When a good actor takes a bad screenplay you can always sense their talent trying to get out.The screenwriters have assembled a comic formula out of the nuts and bolts of other movies and tried to fasten them together to make a funny movie. This never works because 'Cops and Robbersons' is a movie pitch, not a movie itself. It's the beginning of an idea that doesn't need fine tuning so much as it needs a complete overhaul.The movie takes The Robbersons, an ordinary Ozzie and Harriet family and puts as its head Norman Robberson (Chevy Chase) a man who is obsessed with cop shows. The dilemma is that a mobster (Robert Davi) has moved in next door and the authorities want to use the Robbersons' home to stake them out. Leading the stakeout is a rough-hewn cop (Jack Palance) who rolls his own cigarettes and always seems to have one planted in his leathery mug. Saddle that with a nagging wife, a daughter who develops an unconvincing romance with the mobster's son and a 5-year old who plays vampire and bites Palance on the neck.These are nuts and bolts not inspiration. They are the stuff of bad sitcom writing &#x96; the kind of writing that gets a show cancelled. When I see a movie like this that is directed at a sitcom loving audience I always marvel at how much less funny it sounds without a laugh track.Now onto the cast starting with Chevy Chase. My favorite Chase comedies are the ones that allow him to be a smart-ass mostly because he can do it without sounding like a bore. I've seen it in 'Spies Like Us' and 'Funny Farm' and the 'Fletch' pictures and a little in the first 'Vacation' movie. But here he's an annoying dope who is always in the way and just bumbles around reminding me that his Gerald Ford routine was funnier when he did it in a five minute sketch on 'Saturday Night Live'.Jack Palance surprised me in 'City Slickers' by taking his usual tough ol' buzzard persona and injecting it with humanity, warmth and truth. Here he's the same crusty old guy but the warmth and truth are gone because the movie doesn't have time between painful slapstick.Diane Weist has done her best work for Woody Allen. So, I try to measure Diane Weist's characters thusly Would the character she's playing be convincing if she were playing it in a Woody Allen movie, in most cases yes. So, she's playing a good (albiet underwritten) character here in the wrong movie. There is one rather serious moment when she talks to Palance about his smoking that I thought was the movie's only ray of sunshine.I don't know what dragged director Michael Ritchie into this film after directing Chase in 'Fletch' and directing the marvelous (and somewhat similar) 'The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader Murdering Mom'.By the way, you will note that I have avoided describing any of the specific scenes.

Another reason is because they've made Schreck the self-reflexive, enigmatic center of the film, where Dafoe who's playing him can use the ironic references to build up a dialogue between him and the viewers &#x97; is he an actor playing an actor playing an actor or what? Isn't that exactly what the crew are wondering?Ted Goranson, in his review Shadows, Reflections (see the comments section), sees this as an extended hallucination. I agree wholeheartedly. In the end we have Murnau out of his wits thanks to the opium but in the next scene he directs as before, fervently and obsessively, everything ending in a sequence that's as intense as nothing else. Schreck is not a vampire, since we see his reflection in the mirror (Greta thinks there's no reflection) but he's made one by the imaginative power of the filmmaker.While I like Murnau's 1922 film, I adore Herzog's Nosferatu Phantom der Nacht (1979). As said, Merhige's film succeeds in making both films richer, and better for it. Haunting, haunted.

What rocks my world is, of course, the unnaturally acute subjectivity this method emphasizes that can be appreciated and used in abundance in modern art, even in the most mundanely mainstream production that's about avoiding risk, not inviting it.What made the experience even richer was then to proceed with Murnau's film, available on Blu-ray courtesy of the Masters of Cinema series in a beautiful restoration; after that I'd proceed to Herzog's remake, Nosferatu Phantom der Nacht (1979) and close it all with Merhige's Shadow of the Vampire (2000), a brilliant piece of cinema in its own right, not merely as an insight into the Murnau film.So here we are.

Now, there are many eerily effective scenes the carriage is superb and the scenes on the ship are sublime.

For me the type of horror that this genre exemplifies is most exhibited in Dreyer's unconventional film, where the narrative is shifted from the image to our imagination. The images only serve a kind of hallucinatory ambiance for us to invest ourselves in the film. That kind of cinema doesn't tell, it implies. This film, I'm afraid, is a bit too much of the first sort, despite some of the iconic shots that have become staples of vampire films to come.Not that there aren't many brilliant things here.

This Dracula-but-not-Dracula level works for its benefit when seen in retrospect.Then there's the emphasis on names, rather underlined because they are supposed to be like characters from Stoker yet aren't.

The prologue\/overture makes the name Nosferatu into a curse of sorts, warning people from invoking it.And then, of course, the characters of Hutter and Orlok, the first of which is insufferably naive in the beginning, then transformed by Orlok, and then the count himself, who seems so out of place most of the time there's no wonder where the idea for Merhige's film could have originated from. They represent two opposite worlds not only in principle but in reality as well Hutter is the overtly extrovert an ostentatious, and acts accordingly ostentatiously; Orlok is the silently introvert ghost, whose lank figure creeps and haunts the frame. Their antithetical functions are also emphasized not only in their manners but their houses, especially the ones in Britain.

Do you honestly need anymore to tell you how bad this film is? Just in case you weren't tipped off by the title, it sucked. But in fairness how do you make that premise work? Baby Geniuses is never going to be the next Citizen Kane any time soon is it. It sounds more like a writer wanted to make his child into a movie star and used this film as an excuse. I largely watched it because I had a morbid curiosity to see it. It was that same kind of curiosity that makes me wonder just what it would feel like to put my hand on an open flame. I knew I would go through pain but it will give me something to talk about to you psychiatrist. Just like any film, this does have a plot. A dumb plot, but a plot none the less. It follows the premise that all babies are born with intelligence far beyond that of any adult, but that they lose this intelligence when they get older. (I said it had a plot, I did not say that it made sense&#x85;) In one evil lab then they are doing tests to prove that babies can talk by separating twins with one being raised in a lab and one being raised in a regular home environment but are never allowed to meet as it would tamper the experiment. But through the power of bad story telling the child escapes and the wrong twin is brought back to the lab. From this premise alone I begin to wonder what producer saw this script and actually wanted to spend money to make it. As it turns out it's Steven Paul, who is also the writer of the film and the same producer who helped us see Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance. He seems to specialise in films that must be trying to be bad. But the problem is that his films are not so bad they're funny where you laugh because of how stupid the film is. Instead they're just very unpleasant films to watch. In fact, watching this film I didn't laugh once. Not once. It seems to have confused the idea of being annoying with that of being funny. Otherwise I would have no idea of why they would put so much noise of baby giggling in the film. When it's your child giggling you may enjoy it because it's your child, but on screen it is a hair pulling annoyance for all ages.Added to this is that the film is also very creepy, with the babies lip syncing in this being comparable to the last Twilight film (not quite as creepy as that one but we're in the same area of creepiness). And that isn't the only off putting element of this film. When you watch it then you have to witness the awkwardness of extreme close ups, a baby dancing like he was in a 70's film and terrifying giant robot mechanic babies. For the most part a lot of the film could probably be cut out of the film and put into a horror movie, because I certainly felt closer to being frightened then I was to laughing. Another annoying thing that this film has is Christopher Lloyd. In the film he is neither good nor bad. But I know Lloyd and he is capable of doing so much more than some of the garbage films he's done. The thing is this isn't even the worst film he's been, also appearing in Foodfight and Piranha 3d. I'm guessing he gets paid for it, but he's Christopher Lloyd god damn it! He's the Russian who tried to kill Anastasia! The scientist who created time travel! The killer who framed Roger Rabbit! He can play so many memorable roles, but keeps wasting his talent on films that are beneath him! He's a great actor and I can only hope that he will stop choosing such awful films...But Lloyds presence in the film is not the most upsetting thing. The saddest part about this film is that, adjusted for inflation, it earned over 50 million at the box office. People paid money to see this in a cinema. I get watching a film to laugh at how bad it is, but I really question the human race as a species when in a month where films like Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Analyze this come out people pay this much money to see a film like this. Worse yet because it did well at the box office, this film got a sequel. Yes, we live in a world where Dredd is a standalone film and Baby Geniuses gets a sequel. I have yet to see Superbabies Baby Geniuses 2, but somehow people say it is worse than the first. But I'm getting off track, so I'll leave you with this warning. This film was painful to watch and exists for no other reason than to be creepy and annoying. And if you have a twisted mind and get a kick out of listening to babies scream and laugh for an hour and a half then this could be your film. But if not, the only way you could possibly gain pleasure from this is by mocking it.

","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Family"},{"date":"4 June 2014","score":"4 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" Well, if you're reading this you've already read the title of the film. Do you honestly need anymore to tell you how bad this film is? Just in case you weren't tipped off by the title, it sucked. But in fairness how do you make that premise work? Baby Geniuses is never going to be the next Citizen Kane any time soon is it. It sounds more like a writer wanted to make his child into a movie star and used this film as an excuse. I largely watched it because I had a morbid curiosity to see it. It was that same kind of curiosity that makes me wonder just what it would feel like to put my hand on an open flame. I knew I would go through pain but it will give me something to talk about to you psychiatrist. Just like any film, this does have a plot. A dumb plot, but a plot none the less. It follows the premise that all babies are born with intelligence far beyond that of any adult, but that they lose this intelligence when they get older. (I said it had a plot, I did not say that it made sense&#x85;) In one evil lab then they are doing tests to prove that babies can talk by separating twins with one being raised in a lab and one being raised in a regular home environment but are never allowed to meet as it would tamper the experiment. But through the power of bad story telling the child escapes and the wrong twin is brought back to the lab. From this premise alone I begin to wonder what producer saw this script and actually wanted to spend money to make it. As it turns out it's Steven Paul, who is also the writer of the film and the same producer who helped us see Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance. He seems to specialise in films that must be trying to be bad. But the problem is that his films are not so bad they're funny where you laugh because of how stupid the film is. Instead they're just very unpleasant films to watch. In fact, watching this film I didn't laugh once. Not once. It seems to have confused the idea of being annoying with that of being funny. Otherwise I would have no idea of why they would put so much noise of baby giggling in the film. When it's your child giggling you may enjoy it because it's your child, but on screen it is a hair pulling annoyance for all ages.Added to this is that the film is also very creepy, with the babies lip syncing in this being comparable to the last Twilight film (not quite as creepy as that one but we're in the same area of creepiness). And that isn't the only off putting element of this film. When you watch it then you have to witness the awkwardness of extreme close ups, a baby dancing like he was in a 70's film and terrifying giant robot mechanic babies. For the most part a lot of the film could probably be cut out of the film and put into a horror movie, because I certainly felt closer to being frightened then I was to laughing. Another annoying thing that this film has is Christopher Lloyd. In the film he is neither good nor bad. But I know Lloyd and he is capable of doing so much more than some of the garbage films he's done. The thing is this isn't even the worst film he's been, also appearing in Foodfight and Piranha 3d. I'm guessing he gets paid for it, but he's Christopher Lloyd god damn it! He's the Russian who tried to kill Anastasia! The scientist who created time travel! The killer who framed Roger Rabbit!

Sadly, the son of famous martial arts master Bruce Lee, would too suffer from a fatal injury on set, leading to his untimely death before this cult classic was released. What's completely astonishing though, is how well this movie was put together even after Lee's death. One would almost think that Lee only had died after the filming, but not so. There were several edits, body doubles and even CGI used to make it look like Lee was in whole film throughout. For 1994, that's extremely impressive. But this isn't the only outstanding thing to this comic book movie. There's very little to nit pick about.The story is about Eric Draven, a regular everyday man who witnesses the brutal rape and murder of his wife to-be and is killed off as well. This all happens during Halloween (or Devil's Night as its called) in a crime ridden city where buildings are set ablaze just for fun. A year later, Draven is resurrected by a single crow to take vengeance upon the people who took his and wife's life that same night. In the simplest of terms, it is a revenge story, but the execution is done in such a way that gives depth to each character on screen. Alex Proyas, who begins his directorial debut here, keeps a steady pace as well. Of course, the person who carries majority of the entertainment is Brandon Lee.Brandon Lee as Eric Draven gives a performance that feels natural. His delivery of lines are not over-the-top campy, nor are they boring. His voice allows the character to sound serious or kind whenever it is needed. The costume design is also great looking as well. It matches not only the Gothic tone, but also the whole design as a comic book movie. Attempting to understand Draven's case is Sergeant Albrecht (Ernie Hudson). Hudson is one of those actors who most viewers enjoy in whatever film he stars in because of how relaxed he comes across. The main villain behind Devil's Night is called Top Dollar (Michael Wincott) who also gives a performance that is precise with his delivery. He's an anarchist, so all he wants is chaos, thus creating Devil's Night.The violence portrayed here is another strong point. There's no plotting or brooding. All it is, is pure vengeance and no holds bar. It's taking care of business with no thinking which is beneficial to this kind of revenge film. That and the dialog used throughout each scene makes the revenge feel that much more justified. What's surprising, is how it feels like this is the movie that inspired other anti-hero films to do the same kind of theatrics. For example, having an outline symbol lit by flames? The Punisher (2004) and Daredevil (2003) performed those same types of moves during their moments of payback. The Crow (1994) is still the antihero that started it all and should be given respected for that.The special effects have aged rather well too. With most of the background being dark with either black or grey, it's difficult to see what was enhanced by computer and what wasn't. The crows themselves are hard to distinguish between actor and CGI. Dariusz Wolski's cinematography is neat with panning shots of the city that'll make the viewer feel like they are the crow in the sky gliding across the landscape. Wolski would later do all the cinematography for all the Pirates of the Caribbean films. The editing is also competently done considering it looks like Lee was on set for the whole movie even though he died during filming. The only thing that could've been slightly fixed was the music. Graeme Revell's score does contain a soft reoccurring theme, which focuses that on Draven's humanity and love for his wife with gentle flutes. Revell's music also contains saxophone, which is rare for an action film but it works. It makes it feel like a film noir in some senses. Yet, the score lacks any real action cues, other than tribal drums, which make it feel empty in some cases. Also, it's understood that the movie has a Gothic tone but including metal bands in a few scenes wasn't necessary either. Instead Revell could've included tunes that particularly enhanced them with more power and emotion. Other than that, there really isn't anything to truly be upset about. It's one of those rare, dark comic book adaptations that any comic book reader should watch.Although it was Brandon Lee's last film, it's one of his best. The action is dark, special effects look good and the actors pitch great performances. It's Graeme Revell's score that could use some improvement although it is still a special element to the film.

Poitier is a former Northern soldier who has been helping newly freed slaves go west with little help from the vigilantes hired by plantation owners in getting what they still believe their property back so they can continue living their right way of life. The vigilantes are horrible white men who have no qualms in destroying an entire camp, killing men, women and children, in their efforts to scare these people back into slavery. It is almost like a modernized version of The Ten Commandments in that sense, with this group of men the equivalent of Edward G.

Firstly, that it exists as a film that we can still watch and enjoy, and that it was made in the first place, let alone survive, is miraculous. But secondly, and just as importantly, it's remarkable that it exists as it is, vivacious, energetic, fun, interested in the art of filmmaking. In this respect it reminds me of Vigo, who made L'Atalante (1934) knowing he'd die sooner rather than later. The tragedy is tragic, the comedy is comic &#x96; everything works and it's impossible to think how cohesive the film is, considering it was made over several years. In other words, how amazing to have a film made in the bleakest of circumstances that still radiates with so much life. After the curtain literally opens the viewer is treated to three hours of the most amazing drama, comedy and visual filmmaking, as well as clever storytelling. We are thrown in the middle of a street, where everyone is giving a performance Lemaître flirts, Lacaneire gives a monologue (underlined by Garance, who says listening to him is like watching a play), and Baptiste, while acting, witnesses a crime and gives a performance of it in mime. The blind man isn't really blind but merely acting, and later on the love Baptiste and Lemaître have for Garance becomes a play not only once but twice, the latter instance written by some rather ordinary bloke called William-something.It's ironic that I have previously tried to watch the film at least twice, being unable to continue beyond the first twenty minutes (the reasons for this might not be numerous but too domestic to bother you with). But having now watched the film in its entirety, its flow and rhythm makes the time fly. In this respect it's very much like other longer epics (Shichinin no samurai, Lawrence of Arabia) that are somehow condensed into a speck of time, or should we say timelessness. I can't wait to see it again, which leads to the one teeny-weeny problem we fans have, because &#x97;Shamefully the film has been treated with a terrible high definition transfer of the film, and luckily this has been well-documented. Pathé apparently created a 4K scan of the original nitrate negative in 2011 (the work performed at L'Imagine Ritrovata in Bologna, Italy) and then reconstructed and restored in Paris by Eclair Laboratories. But what we have on the Blu-ray is far from wonderful, and only makes one wonder what the 4K scan might have looked like before the terrible digital noise reduction that's only matched by other similar disasters done in DNR to great films (Le samouraï and Madame De... come to mind, the former also a Pathé resto). The Criterion Collection disk in Region A suffers from the exact same problems as the Second Sight in Region B. I hope we won't have to wait for a long time to get an edition of this film that it greatly deserves.
