He was very sick at the time, and probably knew that his next film would be his last. So when choosing his project, he had to choose wisely. He chose The Dead, an adaptation of the James Joyce short story. It was very much a family affair, with his son Tony writing the screenplay and daughter Angelica playing the female lead. It was during the making of the film that his health deteriorated.He died four months before it was released, and during the film making he suffered innumerable challenges. He relied on an oxygen tank to breath, and he couldn't go 20 minutes without it. Sometimes Huston would get stuck in his car, and be unable to get to the stage, and he would have to relay direction through his assistants. Despite these challenges, Huston made the film, based off a supposedly un-filmable story. It was only after multiple revisions that Huston found the right approach, and with it, one of his finest films.THE PLOT Greta and Gabriel Conroy are married, and they like each other, in turn of the century Ireland. They go to a party being held by three spinsters on January the 6th. After the party, they return to their hotel. That is the plot, seriously, that's it. To go into more detail would be frivolous without critical commentary, so that brings me to it.THE CRITICISM The Dead is without a doubt the finest last film of any director with a sizable body of work, that I have seen. What Huston accomplishes in 72 minutes is what most filmmakers try their whole careers to accomplish. The film is so simple, yet its simplicity is its finest asset. Huston here manages to try something new, and for a man in his 80s, who is dying, that is quite a risk. And he pulls it off, of course. Some directors, like Hitchcock and Wilder have tried this approach, and the results aren't generally amazing.If you read the plot, you'll see that the film's plot is quite thin, I could sum it up in five seconds, so Huston relies on characters and mood to set it up. In order to do that you need two things good actors and a good script. And he has both. Some might say that The Dead was an act of nepotism, and yes, Huston draws on his family. John cast Anjelica in three of his films, and under his direction she won an Oscar. Here she gives a performance that doesn't seem to amount to much, for the first hour.Then, near the end, she is walking down the stairs when a tenor from the second floor begins to belt out a tune. I can't name it, but she stops and closes her eyes, swaying gently to the sound of his singing, almost in a trance. Then she goes home and tells her husband of a past lover, who came to her one night, having suffered a terrible sickness. He died, and she believes that she caused him to die, wandering in the rain. But I'm, getting ahead of myself.The performances, Huston (Anjelica, that is) is absolutely terrific. She puts up a facade for the first hour, but then she slowly lets it slip, and you glimpse her. Donal McCann is absolutely terrific in the role of Gabriel, her husband. I hadn't heard of him before this film, and its a shame, his ending monologue is close to perfection. The supporting cast is flawless, consisting mainly of people that I hadn't heard of before, which helps you to believe that they are their respective characters.The screenplay does the wonder of turning what has been called the greatest short story of all time into a motion picture. Tony Huston is more than up to the challenge. It has been said that John Huston had been trying to get the film made for some time, but he couldn't find the right approach, and one day it came to him. The story doesn't need to be jazzed up with flashbacks and unnecessary additions. The best way to adapt the short story is to just tell the story.No embellishes, nothing. Tell it straight. It works. I haven't read the source material, but I want to now, based on the final scene alone. The score perfectly complements the film, striking a melancholy but optimistic chord. Indeed some of the lengthy dialog scenes can be frustrating, especially when they harp on singing and turn of the century Irish-British relations, but for some reason you are still compelled. I feel that what really makes the film work are the characters, they feel real.Huston manages to weave his camera through a scene so well, that it makes you feel that you are almost eavesdropping on someone else's party. By the end, you almost feel as if you know these people, and in a way you do. As the crisp snow falls on a forgotten Irish graveyard, we are reminded that we are all alive, but then we die, and time will pass us by. That brings me to my final comment the title. It sounds as if the film is a horror film, but it is truly about the passage of time, how the dead can haunt the living from beyond the grave, but not in a scary way.The dead hold a power over the living no matter how old and wise you are. They still cast a shadow over our lives, and we remember them until, perhaps, we join them. I debated giving this film a 9.5, but my sentimental side won over my few small problems.

According to the most recent BFI Sight & Sound Poll, this is most definitely the case. Generally, I have little time for polls like this. They're normally voted on by people who are too pretentious to admit that their favourite film isn't really 'Vertigo' or 'Citizen Kane' at all but is actually something much more mainstream like 'Die Hard'. Nevertheless, this is the most comprehensive poll we've got and, in its defence, it's a pretty decent one. Whilst I wouldn't necessarily agree with their assertion that 'Vertigo' is the greatest film ever made, I'd be hard pressed to find any more than a dozen films that rival it.The problem for me, however, is that I don't actually think 'Vertigo' is Hitchcock's greatest film, let alone the greatest film ever made. That's not to say it isn't one of the most accomplished and marvellous pieces of cinema I've ever seen, and it is of course a testament to one of the World's greatest ever directors that a film of this calibre isn't actually his greatest achievement, but if you're a Hitchcock-virgin (he'd love that&#x85;) or you've only ever seen 'Psycho', let me use this opportunity to implore you to get watching the majority of his filmography straight away. And, if you've never seen 'Vertigo', then based on the results of the Sight & Sound Poll it's probably the best place for you to start.At its most basic, 'Vertigo' is a tense and compelling mystery with a resolution that is so simple and, in many ways, so obvious, it's a real testament to Hitchcock's genius that you never catch on until it's spelt out for you. Red herrings jump up at you from all angles and keep you hooked from start to finish, always knocking you off the scent in the most subtle of ways. Ultimately, the only logical explanation for what is going on is exactly the one that Hitchcock tricks you into avoiding. If you're watching it for the first time, the mystery should be more than enough to satisfy you. However, 'Vertigo' is multi-layered and fascinating and thoroughly engrossing on many other levels too. For one, it is a wonderful deconstruction of a man dealing with loss, grief and the aftermath of trauma. James Stewart plays the role of Scottie with all his usual charm, brilliantly portraying every facet of this wonderful and complex character's personality. The manner in which he adapts his performance throughout is so skillful and impressive that it's impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. On another level, it is a film about love and the all-consuming power it can have over people. The mystery often plays second fiddle to the intensity of the relationship between Scottie and Madeleine and, later, between Scottie and Judy. Kim Novak is, as one would only expect, dazzling in her role and alongside Stewart, the characters are utterly captivating.It is Hitchcock's marvellous direction that truly makes the film the absolute classic that it is. His signature camera-work and visual tricks are all used to great effect. Consider, for a moment, that majestic, overhead shot of the Church following Madeleine's apparent jump, or that spellbinding shot from beneath the Golden Gate Bridge that stretches out into the distance, almost like it will never end, both of which give the film a wondrous, dreamlike quality that is all but unrivalled in contemporary cinema. Speaking of which, the dream sequence following the court case is one of the most beautiful and daunting things I have ever seen. Hitchcock was always a master at manipulating colour and imagery to induce any and every emotion that he saw fit in his audience. That particular sequence, however, takes it to a whole new level. For its time, it would have been startling and completely innovative (one can't help but get the feeling that Kubrick borrowed rather heavily from it in the latter part of '2001 A Space Odyssey') and looking back on it now, it's still an incredibly powerful visual piece.This is a film in which colours speak a thousand words, a film in which every shot can be pored over for detail and a film in which every line can have multiple meanings. It is obvious that Hitchcock has devoted so much care and attention to this film that it is only right that it is praised as much as it is. Everything comes together &#x96; intense performances, stunning imagery and a soundtrack by Bernard Herrmann that is so assertive and gripping that the film can go for minutes-on-end without a single word being spoken and still tell you everything you need to know &#x96; to result in a truly thrilling conclusion. As all of the pieces fall into place, and everything becomes clear, Hitchcock drags you on that little bit further and relentlessly cranks the tension up until the credits start to roll and leaves in place a series of emotions that will remain long after they've finished.This is filmmaking at its finest. It's beautiful, it's mesmerising and it's utterly absorbing. It might not be the greatest film ever made but, in a number of ways, it's probably about as close as you're ever going to get.

If you're watching it for the first time, the mystery should be more than enough to satisfy you. However, 'Vertigo' is multi-layered and fascinating and thoroughly engrossing on many other levels too. For one, it is a wonderful deconstruction of a man dealing with loss, grief and the aftermath of trauma. James Stewart plays the role of Scottie with all his usual charm, brilliantly portraying every facet of this wonderful and complex character's personality. The manner in which he adapts his performance throughout is so skillful and impressive that it's impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. On another level, it is a film about love and the all-consuming power it can have over people. The mystery often plays second fiddle to the intensity of the relationship between Scottie and Madeleine and, later, between Scottie and Judy. Kim Novak is, as one would only expect, dazzling in her role and alongside Stewart, the characters are utterly captivating.It is Hitchcock's marvellous direction that truly makes the film the absolute classic that it is. His signature camera-work and visual tricks are all used to great effect. Consider, for a moment, that majestic, overhead shot of the Church following Madeleine's apparent jump, or that spellbinding shot from beneath the Golden Gate Bridge that stretches out into the distance, almost like it will never end, both of which give the film a wondrous, dreamlike quality that is all but unrivalled in contemporary cinema. Speaking of which, the dream sequence following the court case is one of the most beautiful and daunting things I have ever seen. Hitchcock was always a master at manipulating colour and imagery to induce any and every emotion that he saw fit in his audience. That particular sequence, however, takes it to a whole new level. For its time, it would have been startling and completely innovative (one can't help but get the feeling that Kubrick borrowed rather heavily from it in the latter part of '2001 A Space Odyssey') and looking back on it now, it's still an incredibly powerful visual piece.This is a film in which colours speak a thousand words, a film in which every shot can be pored over for detail and a film in which every line can have multiple meanings. It is obvious that Hitchcock has devoted so much care and attention to this film that it is only right that it is praised as much as it is. Everything comes together &#x96; intense performances, stunning imagery and a soundtrack by Bernard Herrmann that is so assertive and gripping that the film can go for minutes-on-end without a single word being spoken and still tell you everything you need to know &#x96; to result in a truly thrilling conclusion. As all of the pieces fall into place, and everything becomes clear, Hitchcock drags you on that little bit further and relentlessly cranks the tension up until the credits start to roll and leaves in place a series of emotions that will remain long after they've finished.This is filmmaking at its finest. It's beautiful, it's mesmerising and it's utterly absorbing. It might not be the greatest film ever made but, in a number of ways, it's probably about as close as you're ever going to get.

I've noticed on here there are a lot of 1 star reviews, all of which are rather ignorant and at times rather obnoxious. It's understandable if it doesn't live up to your expectations, but I don't even think this movie should have the option of a star rating below 5 because anyone who gives it lower rating should not really be reviewing movies. I admit that I was very against the idea of this film, the idea that it was so popular but would really live up to the standards set by so many sycophantic fans seemed almost impossible to me. Having already been disappointed by the movie Avatar (not visually of course, but for the predictable and, at times, tiresome plot). The Godfather, on the other hand, has a much more unpredictable storyline, yet nothing that happens is a huge shock. At times seemingly arbitrary events eventually collate into a cohesive part of the movie. Despite pushing the 3 hour mark, you are constantly entertained, and hanging on to every word, almost every action holds some importance and the feeling that something is about to happen is constant and justified.I don't want to reveal too much about the movie so I shall attempt to keep the review vague in places, and will stop in regards to the storyline now. Even if the storyline fails to inspire, at the very least, some sort of appreciation, there are five words that command respect Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. They give the film a level of cool, control and power that affects the viewer in many ways, and maybe even re-establishes the idea of acting. Powerful emotions, casually being used with an air on nonchalance and grace, emotions that are usually over-played, and over-acted in other movies in which actors flaunt their talents carelessly. In this film we get a masterclass in acting from two masters of the screen. The acting from every character is pitched perfectly, every character balances each other out, and their personalities are contrastingly complimentary towards each other. I have a lot of good to say about this movie, so now I should explain why i gave it a mere 8.9. Firstly I must admit I don't believe in the idea that there is such thing as a perfect movie, so I am viewed as a somewhat harsh marker, and thus it would never get a full 10.0, but there are some aspects of this film that I believe to be either superfluous or under-developed. Basically put, there are bits that could maybe be replaced by some extra character or storyline developments. This, however, is just a personal issue, and I would stress that 8.9 is the second highest rating I have ever given, and to be honest, my mind is constantly changing on that score, and I may actually, in the future, wish to raise it. On a final note, I will just say that this truly is one of the greatest films ever made, and I would urge anyone reading this to watch the film.

We've all seen those movies where we leave the theater thinking we can sing any song, or move to any beat that comes our way, and this is one of those movies. The dancing is different from any other movie, because although it takes place in the sixties, the dancing is so much more risqué than anything movie watchers were accustomed to seeing at that point in time. While using older songs combined with young, sensual dancing the movie is able to reach out to an audience with a variety of ages.The movie introduces its unique dancing early on, automatically intriguing the viewers to question things like Did people really dance like that? and Could I learn how? The movie is able to reach out to these common people by having the main character, Baby Houseman, witness the dancing for the very first time and shows her utter shock, but also her desire to know more. As the plot continues and the characters become more developed the dancing becomes not only a sight to see, but also it leaves a window for inferences to be made. As Baby is trained to dance by bad-boy Johnny the viewers begin to wonder if their sensual dancing will ever lead to something more? This movie is able to take the typical idea of boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love and completely make it new, unique, and fascinating all through the use of dance.As Baby and Johnny get to know each other better throughout their training process, the movement of their dancing goes from simply following the motions, and transitions to actually feeling the music and even expressing their inner feelings for one another. As their love affair grows so does the viewers love and desire to see more and more dancing. The movie does a great job creating the idea that the characters are their truest selves in dancing scenes more than any other.I think so many people enjoy the movie because it doesn't just tell a love story, but shows one. It is able to show a love story not by the characters words but by their choreography. Before Baby or Johnny even declares their feelings for one another it is seen in the way their dancing morphs over time, from impersonal to all consuming. To the characters in the movie, their raunchy dancing is a way to rebel against the expectations of the generations above them, and through this the movie gives the audience a sense of defiance and the idea that they should be proud to do what they love, no matter what society may think.Over all it is so difficult to pin-point what makes Dirty Dancing the wonderful, cliché classic that it is, but the dancing aspect I feel is what ties the intriguing plot, the charismatic characters, the music, and the beautiful setting all together to create something more than a romantic drama. Dirty Dancing is one of those movies I could watch time after time and only grow more in love with it.

Ten years after its release, this feels dreadfully out of place and unwelcome, like a wino at a cocktail party. But even without context, this movie isn't the best example of the genre as it's quite pedestrian, playing fast-and-loose with logic and offering little in the way of entertainment and thrills.Gordy Brewer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a fire-fighter who tragically loses his wife and child (Lindsay Frost and Ethan Dampf) in a terrorist bombing. The FBI quickly establish the culprit - a Colombian rebel by the name of Claudio The Wolf Perrini (Cliff Curtis) - but are unable to act due to forthcoming peace talks between the government and the rebels. But Brewer is not a man who takes things laying down and after a quick bit of research on the internet, decides to pursue The Wolf to Colombia himself. But when it comes down to it, will Brewer be able to kill the man who murdered his family especially when Perrini's wife Selena (Francesca Neri) gets involved in Brewer's private quest for vengeance? Back in the day, movies like Collateral Damage came along every few months or so and involved little more than constant explosions, heavy gun fights, a pouty woman who might be a love-interest or not and the lead actor grimacing enough to convince you the CG was real.

Compare this to another of Schwarzenegger's earlier action films - namely, True Lies. That film was just as ridiculous as this but it realised that it could be played for laughs as well, that a little fun could be poked at the genre - take the moment Jamie Lee Curtis drops an Uzi down stairs but the gun goes off and still takes out a number of baddies. Collateral Damage, by contrast, feels stubbornly miserable - when the inevitable ending comes, there is no sense of joy or pleasure in the outcome. The film needed a little relief from the action but offered nothing except more fisticuffs and explosions. And before you remind me about the plot-twist, I'd like to say that it was obvious from the start but still didn't fit it in with what went before it.

It's based on a novel by John le Carre, famed for his gritty and realistic spy thrillers, yet stars the man famous for playing the exact opposite of le Carre's thrillers James Bond. But those contradictions are just on the surface, with the film itself resulting in a few surprises,Perhaps the biggest surprise of the film is Pierce Brosnan. Given that he's playing a British spy, and that the film came out in the midst of his tenure as James Bond, one might assume that he would be playing a slightly different take on 007. Nothing could be much farther than the truth. Andy Osnard is a character who is almost unlikeable arrogant, cursing, sexist and ultimately a man with no loyalty except to himself. Yet, despite being unlikeable, Osnard (and Brosnan) is the one you can't take your eyes off of in whatever scene he's in. He's the corrupt heart and soul of the film and the film is, ultimately, better for it.The rest of the cast does well for the most part. Geoffrey Rush as the titular tailor of the title, Harry Pendel, gives a fine performance as the good with a checkered past who, drawn into Osnard's sphere of influence, begins setting a series of events in motion that threatens to unravel everything around him. There are also good performances from Catherine McCormack and David Hayman as well as Leonor Varela and Brendan Gleeson as two old revolutionaries drawn into the events around them and worse off for it. There are also some nice pseudo-cameos as well from Dylan Baker, Jonathan Hyde and noted playwright Harold Pinter as the proverbial spirit of the late Uncle Benny who acts as the conscience of his nephew Harry. The weak link of the cast is Jamie Lee Curtis who, for reasons that are unclear, has little to do in the film.If Osnard is the film's physical heart and soul, then its metaphysical one is the script based on the novel of the same name by John le Carre. By le Carre's own admission, The Tailor Of Panama is a take on Graham Greene's Our Man In Havana, updated from 1950s Cuba to late 1990s (early 2000s for the film) Panama. At the film's heart is a tale of how one man (Osnard) and his corrupting influence of those around him, told through the prism of a spy story. Intriguingly, the film in retrospect almost seems like an odd premonition of events leading up to the invasion of Iraq set in another part of the world British intelligence that is ultimately dubious, as is its source, is used to justify a US invasion.Yet the film suffers from a glaring flaw. The film's tone is all over the place as director John Boorman has the film bouncing around between serious spy thriller, black comedy and domestic drama. The three in this case don't sit well next to one another which can lead to undermining of otherwise key moments (such as when Harry yells at those in his shop as the film begins to head towards its conclusion). The result is a film that is uneven to the point of fault.Despite the tonal issue, the film has plenty going for it. From Brosnan's performance to the strong script from the le Carre novel, The Tailor Of Panama is still an intriguing film.

The cast are brilliant,the scenes hilarious,and we can all relate to certain scenes throughout the film. Everything Clark touches turns to rubbish but he still perseveres and does not give up. Laugh out loud funny and one you will watch every year . No other Christmas film lives up to this standard (Bill Murrey's Scrooged comes a close second.)

Another female student by the name of Gretchen (Anna Loos) has also been accepted and becomes her roommate. While traveling from Munich to Heidelberg they encounter a young man named David (Arndt Schwering-Sohnrev) who has heart problems and passes out on the train. Paula administers CPR and manages to revive him. However, once they begin their anatomy course they find his body laid out for dissection. Thinking something is wrong Paula sends some blood and tissue samples to a friend for analysis. At any rate, rather than reveal the rest of the story, I'll just say that this is an exciting horror-mystery movie with good suspense and a couple of twists at the end. Although originally filmed in German, the version I saw was dubbed in English and may require some people to make allowances. Even so, I found it to be quite enjoyable. I also liked the performances of Franka Potente, Anna Loos and Sebastian Blomberg (who played the role of Paula's boyfriend, Caspar). As a side note, it won the Audience Award for German Film of the Year at the German Film Awards. And while that's certainly not as impressive as an Academy Award, it is a good indicator that this could be a film that fans of horror or mystery might find interesting.

Well, I have the perfect one. The Count of Monte Cristo is a movie with a love story for the romantics and the adventure and revenge for the thrill seeking. One of my all-time favorites; it is truly an epic tale of revenge, love, betrayal, friendships, and justice. This is a lengthy movie at 131 minutes set back in the 1800s but well worth it; you don't even realize you have been sitting there as the story unfolds. The Count of Monte Cristo has a lineup of some great actors who do this film great justice. To name a few of these there is Jim Caviezel, Guy Pierce, and Richard Harris. Please give this movie a chance; it does have slow times but the scenery alone will get you through that. You have to have some in-depth detail in the characters life to really get the big picture. In the end you will be very glad you stuck through it; the twists and turns are laid out beautifully and it all comes together to give you that ah-hah moment of a great film. With the movies that come out today why not give an older movie a chance. Some older movies are forgotten gems!This movie begins with the back story and the friendship between the three main characters; Dantes (Caviezel), Mondego (Pierce), and Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk). Dantes is a simple shipmate who is very good friends with Mondego who is a Count's son. Dantes is in love with Mercedes but they have to wait a few years to marry until Dantes can afford a ring. Mondego is very jealous of how happy they are together and doesn't feel that nobility should want what a peasant has. This is only where the hate, revenge, justice and love story only begin. Dantes is wrongly accused by his best friend Mondego and sent to the prison Château D'if. This is where Dantes training and plan for revenge is so carefully and innately laid out with help from the priest who is also a prisoner. The beginning does start out a little slow but you truly need this information to see where the different characters stand in this film. Once Dantes escapes from the prison the action and his plan for revenge really begins to unfold. You don't suspect half the plots he has planned and everything works out so sweet with irony. Mondego is so unsuspecting of this revenge. He thinks his money and power can protect him from anything. Dantes' true love, Mercedes, marries Mondego shortly after Dantes is taken to the Château D'if. This causes Dantes to possess an incredible amount of hate for her. The writer of this film along with Mercedes (Dominczyk), truly play on the audiences emotions. In the beginning you almost feel the hate for her that Dantes does. You keep asking the same questions as he does, why would you betray him and marry the very man who put him in that horrible prison? Later you find out she was actually pregnant with Dantes' son so she had to marry someone quick or be stamped a whore back in those days. Your emotions are on a roller coaster when it comes to this love story. You can actually see the pain in her face as the new Count of Monte Cristo, formerly Dantes, comes prancing back into her life. She calls him a ghost to haunt her giving great imagery of how she constantly has him on her mind.With some of the slower times throughout the movie you will be caught off guard with the breath taking scenery. This is a great tool that was incorporated in this film that definitely had some time achieving. From the absolute breathtaking ocean views to the hillsides they did not fall short. The plantation homes and properties they show are indescribable. They really get you with the beauty and money they portray in these characters. The lavish homes are constantly filled with parties fit for queens. It puts you in the movie; giving you that exact feeling of how it must have been in those times.Overall, this is a spectacular movie. It remains my favorite to this day. Like I said, this movie includes every genre and aspect so that all movie goers can be happy in one film. So cozy up with your date have the popcorn and tissues ready; he'll be ready for those plot turning bouts of revenge and she will be ready for the romance and love of the story. Definitely a must see even though it is several years old. Sometimes you need a really good feel good type of movie with the movies they come out with today. Sit back, relax and enjoy!

Even his long-time mistress and mother of the child Pansy, Merle, is deceived by him until he finally, at the end, tells her he never cared about her either and she realises she has wasted her life on him and suffered from having to hide the true identity of her child for nothing.Osmond's method is the well-known Whatever happens it's always your fault, I am perfect and blameless, I am a saint and you are selfish\/thoughtless\/stupid\/venomous\/a liar\/hiding the truth\/whatever along with the ruthless Victorian head of the family you do as I say nonsense that women had to put up with in that period.

She becomes aware gradually that he is being unfair but hasn't the guts to tell him so to his face and then walk out - it would be difficult but perfectly possible for her to have fled with her American lover Goodwood who is at his wits end why it is she won't be with him even though clearly she has feelings for him.Osmond's daughter falls for the wrong man. Isabel tries to help Pansy, by helping to deter the suitor her father wants, but Osmond soon finds out, accuses his wife of being treacherous and sends his daughter to a convent to think about her errors and her future.

So much for Isabel trying to help the girl to be with the man who loved her - Pansy is revealed as shallow like her parents. Isabel is a fool - she has allowed herself to be brainwashed by a jerk because she thought he was glamorous (though anyone less glamorous than this Osmond would be hard to find, I disliked him on sight, quite correctly). Isabel's kindly cousin Ralph has the sadly not unusual consumption, and now is dying and Isabel goes to him in England in spite of her husband refusing to believe Ralph was that ill, ie a means to again force his wife to his own bidding through trading on her loyalty.

This sequel isn't about to mess with a winning formula, so the basic idea is the same. Ace pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) is no longer such a neurotic mess - although he still has his moments of self-doubt - as he's forced to take over the controls to the first manned space shuttle to the moon, which has been colonized. Fortunately for him, also along for the ride is old girlfriend Elaine (Julie Hagerty). The absence of the Zucker - Abrahams - Zucker filmmaking team is palpable as new writer \/ director Ken Finkleman tries his best to both revisit previously used jokes and come up with some of his own. He doesn't do too bad a job - there are some genuine laughs to be had, as movies such as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and 2001 A Space Odyssey are parodied - but the review in the annual Maltin paperback guide to movies is actually spot on when it says that the quality of the jokes just isn't the same, nor are the laughs quite as frequent. The cast tries hard with the material, and they're still fun to watch. One good thing is that Finkleman is able to keep up the tradition of having things happen in both foreground and background so that viewers are required to pay attention to catch all the gags. Hays and Hagerty are just as endearing as they were in the first film, and are supported by Chad Everett (as the slimy Simon) and returning players from Airplane! such as Peter Graves (continuing with the inappropriate questions), zany Stephen Stucker as the character Jacobs, Al White as the jive talking witness, David Leisure as one of the Transcendental Air guys, Lee Bryant as Mrs. Hammen, and Lloyd Bridges as the harried Steve McCroskey. Robert Stack, Leslie Nielsen, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar are sorely missed, but Finkleman does pack his film with cameos - Chuck Connors, William Shatner (doing some priceless Shatner style over acting), Raymond Burr, John Vernon, John Dehner, Rip Torn, Sonny Bono, Richard Jaeckel, Jack Jones (singing the 'Love Boat' theme), Art Fleming, etc. Plenty of other recognizable performers, too Laurene Landon, John Larch, John Hancock, Oliver Robins, Leon Askin, Sandahl Bergman, James Noble, Rick Overton, David Paymer, Pat Sajak (!); sitcom stars George Wendt and Joyce DeWitt have uncredited bits, as does super sexy Monique Gabrielle as the gal who has a delicious way of dealing with imminent doom. There's enough good stuff here to make for pleasant if not hilarious fare. Among the best bits the trial sequence, the dealings with omnipotent computer R.O.K., and the outer space scenes with Shatner.

Mr.Kubrick has this typical style to portray extremities of the human behavior when under pressure or showcasing the delusional side of the human mind. He did it in The Shining, The clockwork orange and now again in FMJ.Many war movies have been made that take the viewer through how and why American wars were futile and without purpose. FMJ takes the same topic and shows it in typical Kubrick style - extreme side of human behavior which is sometimes delusional, background sets in line with the mood of the movie, script which shocks the viewer. FMJ does not really have a plot, but a good script. The script builds up the confusion which war has created in the minds of these so-called men. They do not know what they are fighting for - some are patriots without reason, some love guns, some are trigger happy cowboys who just want to shoot NVA (north Vietnamese army). The initial training drills on the island described the brainwash that marines are made to go through to make them brain-dead killing-on-order zombies. Even if some of them realize the futility of it all, they continue to do it so that they confirm to the larger madness. Joker had realized that but he still punished Pyle Lawrence, which eventually led Lawrence to shoot the sergeant and commit suicide.The script then shows how these Trained Marines act in the field. During the sniper scene, there was no plan which the marines were following - they were randomly moving around which got 3 of them killed, acting on pure motion, defying direct orders from platoon leader and looking for payback when the third soldier is killed. Stanley Kubrick shows brilliantly what war does to young men - it turns marines into brainless mercenaries thirsty for blood. These marines thoughtlessly sing the mickey mouse song once they have killed their targets.Camera-work was typical Stanley Kubrick style adapting as per the scene's requirements- hand-held camera when the marines are moving made the viewer feel as if he is present there and moving along with the marines, camera showing what the NVA sniper sees making the viewer skip a heartbeat and adding to the thrill factor.All in all, this is a different and typical Kubrick style of cinema. Though I still felt that maybe this was an incomplete movie, but then again, wars are pointless. This could have been dragged the same way as shown in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, but guess it conveyed the same point in half the time. 7.5 out of 10 for me.
