This is one of cinema's greatest mysteries; how can a film as well made, constantly intriguing and brilliantly conceived as this one constantly get passed over? And in favour of many under deserving films as well? Really strange. Almost as big a mystery as the one I've just mentioned is the web of intrigue created here. Through deep, complex characters and situations rich with double meaning, Anthony Minghella has turned Patricia Highsmith's original novel into a cinematic masterpiece. The talented Matt Damon stars as the talented man of the title that is offered $1000 to travel to Italy to try and return Dickie; the rich and spoilt son of a millionaire. What follows is a complex, disturbing and fascinating expose of a man ingratiating himself into the lives of Dickie, his girlfriend Marge and high society on the whole...The main reason why The Talented Mr. Ripley works so well is that it's central characters are deep labyrinths that beg to explored and analysed. Every scene is rich with double meaning and character interactions that exist under the surface of the drama we are seeing on screen. The character of Tom Ripley is a true masterpiece of characterisation indeed. This sociopath, that would rather be a pretend somebody than a real nobody is a myriad of contradictions and muddled personalities. His actions are always amoral and through his lies and deception, it is obvious that he doesn't care at all for anyone around him. However, despite this; we are still able to feel for him through his tribulations. The story is told in such a way that it is difficult to feel for any of the other characters and all of our sympathies lie with the talented Tom Ripley. This puts the audience in a strange situation, as we're used to hating the antagonist and feeling for the protagonist, but this film turns that on it's head, and to great effect.The film is helped implicitly by the fact that it's one of the most professionally made films ever to make it onto the screen. Every scene, every action, every line uttered is done with the greatest assurance and nothing at all in the film appears to be there by accident or out of place. The way that the characters interact with each other and their surroundings is always believable and we never question anything that is shown on screen. Anthony Minghella's direction is more than solid, and this is helped by the stunning photography, courtesy of 1950's Italy. Many a film has benefited from Italy's landscape, and this is one of them. This is all great, but it's the performances that put the final finishing touch on this amazing masterclass of film-making. As mentioned, the talented Mr Damon takes the lead role and completely makes it his own. He often gets coupled with his friend, Ben Afleck, when it comes to acting; but this is very unfair as Damon is one of today's brightest stars. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow make up the other two leads. I'm not the biggest fan of either of these two stars, but both, like Damon, give performances here that will always be associated with their personalities. Cate Blanchett has a small role, but the real plaudits for the smaller performances go to the brilliant Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who steals every scene he's in.The Talented Mr. Ripley is one stunning piece of film. Ignore the people that don't consider this one of the 1990's greatest achievements; they are wrong. The film is a masterpiece of tense situations, great characterisation and professional film-making. And I refuse to hear otherwise.

Steve Railsback (the main character) is on the run for a silly crime and finds his way to a beach resort. As he enters the resort a song begins playing on the soundtrack 'Out of nowhere, out of darkness into light&#133;and you watch and wonder where you belong, and the crowd it moves and takes you along&#133;.you ask yourself what good are your dreams, in a world where nothing is as it seems'. The song sums up the title character's situation and its melody will replay several times later in the film. He joins a crowd watching the film production of a WWI battle sequence. The crowd politely applauds at the end of each take. Then during a new scene there are huge explosions and smoke obscures much of where the action is being staged. The onlookers (and we viewers) look on with horror as the smoke clears and reveals a beach saturated with blood and dismembered bodies. The onlookers scream, the director yells cut, and the stunt men pull themselves out of the sand unhurt. The crowd goes wild with applause, far more appreciative about being fooled by the 'fabricated reality' than they were by their glimpse behind the scenes of the movie-making action. And this is the structure with The Stunt Man, viewers (like those in the crowd) are supposed to be kept off balance by this movie within a movie.Yet this is merely a device to advance the storyline, which involves a complex theme about paranoia and trust. Railsback likens his relationship with the movie company's director-Peter O'Toole, and by analogy everyone's situation at some point of their life, to an incident he witnessed in Viet Nam. Someone stepped on a 'Bouncing Betty Mine', an anti-personnel device that while triggered by a person's weight, does not actually detonate until the person steps off the device. At this point there is no choice but to remain standing on the mine, trusting that something will happen to favorably change the situation. Just as in life there are times in the 'free will vs destiny' interplay when there is nothing you can do but place your trust a higher authority. Like 'The Ninth Configuration' (a film made about the same time and highly recommended for those interested in this theme); an authority figure works to redeem someone in his care by teaching them to trust someone or something, even when everything screams for them to step off the mine. While The Stunt Man is an excellent movie, which tells a valuable story in an interesting multi-layered fashion; it is not really the masterpiece that Director Richard Rush and its biggest fans claim. A lot of effort was made to portray Eli Cross (the O'Toole character) as an omniscient 'Godlike' figure and a genius filmmaker; a necessary characterization if the film's theme is to be sold to the viewing audience. Unfortunately these efforts are largely undermined by the moronic nature of the film within the film. The artistic picture this eccentric genius is making is not even on the intellectual level of Laurel and Hardy's 'Flying Deuces', and it has about the same level of slapstick with none of the humor. So there is a major credibility disconnect. You have to sympathize with Wells as he had huge obstacles to overcome getting this film into production and he simply did not have the resources to stage a credible action-adventure tale. But a better approach would have been to stage small things well rather than grand things cheaply; so the painfully on-the-cheap production design is ultimately his fault. A director bent on misdirection has a huge arsenal for manufacturing illusion; look at the widely different techniques successfully employed in 'Pulp Fiction', 'The Sixth Sense', and 'State & Main' for viewer misdirection. It is easy because the viewer only knows what the director chooses to reveal, yet the director must be careful that the viewer does not feel cheated. As Roger Ebbert said, some of the stunts are staged so that they're not only deceiving to Railsback (as intended), but plainly impossible. And the stunts are sneaky, at one point Railsback is on a tower that's blown up in flames. There is no plausible way he could have escaped alive-but the movie merely cuts to another shot of him, without explaining his escape. A film that depends on deceiving us has got to play by its own rules. Deceiving the audience is the magic of movies, but they can't be cheated on particulars. Overall the degree of misdirection was rather spartan and not particularly clever (that darn low budget) , meaning that they did not begin to create the degree of suspense that was necessary.That said there were some interesting little details to look for when watching this film A tight two-shot of Railsback and O'Toole on the beach, they step onto a platform which turns out to be attached to an unseen crane and are lifted into the air, the actors do not betray that this is happening-their conversation continues as the background changes. O'Toole compares Railsback to Alice about to enter Wonderland, he asks him to close his eyes and then the scene cuts to a hairdresser telling Railsback to open his eyes and see his physical transformation. Watch for the many deep focal transitions (particularly at the dinner scene) and the literal framing (like a painting with a frame)of many shots-which is used to promote the everything is a fabricated illusion message. Watch for the piglets spilling out of the baby carriage during one of the battle scenes-another Alice element. Watch for the very inventive shot of Railsback looking into the rolled down car window, shot through the rolled up window on the other side, with Barbara Hershey's face reflected in the frame.

It is the story of how a boxer, a crime boss, two hit men, a couple at a local restaurant, and others are somehow weaved into each others own personal stories. But how this film is so different from any other film is the fact that the film is very mixed up. It took me a while to finally understand where the film actually begins and where it ends. But all in all, I'd have to say that this is Tarantino's best work yet.It all starts off with the couple at the restaurant Pumpkin(Roth) and Hunny Bunny(Plummer) having an average conversation with one another without having the viewer expect anything until they pull out their guns and tell everybody it's a robbery and to give them their wallets. Definitely a great way to start off the movie. The next part leads into the two hit men Jules(Jackson) and Vincet(Travolta) doing a job for their boss Marsellus Wallace(Rhames). This scene soon breaks off before it can finish and leads off into another story. But is this what made Pulp Fiction so good was the mix up of the scene's. Anyways, the movie goes on about how the characters are weaved into each others stories including the conflict between the boxer Butch(Willis) and Marsellus or when Vincet takes Marsellus' wife Mia(Thurman) out on a date that ends in disaster.

He successfully uses many reflection-frames to suggest to people that life is not just working hard and making money. The first reflection-frame happens when grandma is suddenly sent to the hospital. Yang has the camera focus on the hospital windows during the dialogue between NJ and his brother-in-law, A-Di, so we can see their reflection on the windows. Reflection-frames in each film do not always have the same meanings and they depend on different situations. Therefore, I suggest that Yang tried to show that people can see their reflection by windows or mirror anytime, but they are too busy to look and see how they have changed.Also, they are afraid to face the truth in the reflection because the truth is not what they want. A-Di's reflection on the windows shows us his dishonesty. He always has trouble with money, and his promise that he will give back NJ's money soon is not true. On the other hand, NJ actually does not care much about money. Moreover, in this reflection, there is one window frame set between them, and their reflection is separated by that window frame. The separation suggests that NJ is different than A-Di, and the value of money is not as an important to NJ as A-Di. Also, A-Di's reflection in the framed window takes up more space than NJ's reflection. Yang may suggest that the majority of people in the big city are like A-Di who has the ambition to make a great deal of money. People in the city are unhappy and unsatisfied with the property they have, so they spend more time to make more money. However, NJ taking up a small space in the framed reflection represents the minority of people who struggle to find work that is interesting to them. Mostly, people whose work interest them can not make enough money for their family. Besides, Yang can be connected with NJ's reflection, which takes up a small and narrow space in the frame. He chooses the work which he is interested, but his films hardly make money even through he makes great films. Referencing to Yang's background, he graduated from an electric engineering department in good school. He can work in a highly technical company and have a good paying job, like NJ. However, he predicts that he will be unhappy as NJ is. Therefore, he chooses to make films as his job and enjoy it whether or not his film can make money as commercial film. The reflection-frame in the hospital is an ironic NJ is worrying about the situation of his mother-in-law, but A-Di is worrying about his financial trouble. Because A-Di was born and raised by the person who is in the emergency room, he should show more worry than NJ, but A-Di doesn't. This situation reminds me of Noriko in Ozu's Tokyo Story (1953). Noriko shows more care to her dead husband's parents than other members in the family.

I believe this movie is an absolute masterpiece and it's hard to keep me entertained for more than 90 minutes. This movie ran SLOWER than Mystic River and Harry Potter 3 combined and I still managed to stay riveted to my seat. For me, it was the passion that Eric Bogosian put into his performance. It's extremely difficult to pull off such a stunt and manage to garner any positive effect from it. Bogosian probably nailed one of the toughest single-man performances in modern cinema. I didn't have any respect for Bogosian until the end of the film. The entire monologue minutes before the inexorable climax was the turning point, it was the key that turned me around. This man hit a point so low that he knew he could never recover from it. The corporate boys congratulated him on the performance. His blistering prose made even the slimiest one in the cavalcade shake his head in awe. It made me realize that personal integrity and hypocrisy don't matter in the world of talk radio, even in the corporate world for that matter. Stone may have been pushing some uber-liberal agenda but it was the actual movie and production that got my attention. Oliver Stone is a minor master of the moody. The final third of the film had probably the best lighting and cinematography I have seen in any film. Stone artfully makes the DJ booth feel like five-by-seven cell in a nineteenth century prison. Visually speaking, it appears that Bogosian's only friend is the black foam that absorbs his routine vitriol. He speaks and it doesn't speak back. It's a sad metaphor considering the way he treats the people who handed him his success. Stone and Bogosian carved out a stunning film of a man who is trapped in both a prison of walls and a prison of self. This man is confined to his own volition and he can never escape it. The scene that made me realize his conundrum was when he was unwilling to his ex-wife back. He preferred his own prison instead of the world on the outside. Every story has a conflict and it came down to the simplest of all conflicts man versus himself. 'Talk Radio' presents this conflict in an intelligent, gripping, and artful fashion. There are no hidden messages in this film and the progression of events should be expected by any astute viewer. I just leaned back and let my mind be grasped by this film and I loved it.

Maybe the scene that impressed me the most is after the trial, in which Daniel gets free without any problem, when he is talking to the man that wanted to be his defense (that Daniel refused), in a very tall building (that remembers to me the biblical story in which Jesus is on the top of the mountain with Satan, being tempted), when he says you could have this city if you want... It's really moving. And like that one I could mention lots more. Even in the very end, when Daniel dies, and her friends give his healthy organs to other persons and you can see them they will live longer the resurrection.

No, Brokedown Palace was not perfect and yes it's plot has been done many times before. That doesn't mean it shouldn't be done again if it is done well and I think this movie had some strong moments. The acting of Claire Danes, as already mentioned many times, was flawless as was Kate Beckinsell and I Think Bill Pullman was absolutely terrific as was the supporting performances(Pullman's wife, the crooked cop, skip or trip or whatever his name is). The cinematography was also beautifully filmed, there was a lot that's good to this movie even if there were some negatives(three major ones that I found) as well.Here is what I didn't like about it-the friendship between the girls-In fact, the girls' own individual personalities-were not developed in depth until the late middle of the pic. It would not have been improbable to lose interest before then, because, despite the positives, more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested, were almost glossed over so there was a bit to much Jumping around without the character and scene development I think would have been appropriate for this type of film.

Somehow I subconsciously had an association with that other Sergio Leone's epic Once Upon a time in the west, but only because of the similar use of the title - Once upon a time in......I had only heard of the movie before, and had read the plot as described in the TV-guide, so i was aware this was a gangster's movie and not a western. After that first time I had not the idea this was one of the best movies i had ever seen (the slow pace of the plot is often discussed and I guess it did annoy me a little bit the first time). But being a film adapt I watched the movie the next weekend again and I already got really intrigued by the plot and the director's choice to cut the film in non-chronological style. That's why this is a typical movie you have to see at least three times. Now I believe the movie deserves to be rated 'a masterpiece'.As it comes to the plot i also compared the film with the Deer Hunter -In both films you can see how a very close relation\/friendship between a group of people can be very harshly torn apart due to either the evil things of war(in the deer hunter) or different ambitions between two characters (Max's ambition to be part of the rich elite and Noodles that wants to stay in the stink of the gutter....) Another similar detail between the two movies that - until so far - in no comment was noted is the score at the end of both movies As well as in the Deer Hunter as in OUATIA, you hear 'God bless America', in the Deer Hunter, Meryl Streep starts to sing because they seek comfort with each other, and in OUATIA you hear the original version.Finally, Robert de Niro's performance is again impeccable - probably one of his best besides Taxi Driver (1976). James Woods also shows his best performance like all other actors in a supporting role. I do not agree with the critic-asters that underrate the movie because of its length and slow pace of plot. In my opinion the slow pace is a strength of the movie which you can indeed only value after you have seen the movie several times. The slow pace contributes to the built-up tension (Noodles nerve-breaking slowly stirring his coffee when he returns from holiday and max deviates the pay-off)perfectly shot by Leone. Due to the slow pace the eventual impact of some of the scenes (and especially the last scene at the 1968 reunion at Secretary's Baily's room) makes you left behind appalled.

It's highly based on your own background, mental strengths, and how you feel about life in general. My review of this movie may completely disagree with someone else's review or how they saw the movie. My thoughts and feelings on it may be so different as to cause some people to even think I'm an idiot. But that's what this movie does, it leaves so much open to interpretation. First of all, I don't think Danny was 100% a self-hating Jew, I think he hated the Jewish religion and himself for being a Jew at the beginning of the movie, but I don't think he had ever met anyone who was more intense about their feelings about the Jews than he was until he went to that camp that Billy Zane sent him to. There I think he began to see what being an anti-Semite really was. He saw that that meant not only destroying the people, but also their religion, their thoughts, their feelings, dragging them through the mud and destroying things that he felt were still worth saving. Ultimately, this all led to his own demise. He didn't die in the end because people found out he was Jewish. He did that because he felt it was time for him to make amends for his sins and to deal with what he had created. In a way, from that day that he left Hebrew school, God did strike him down. God made his life hard for him to live and deal with from then on. Look at how he finally has to come to terms and face to face with his past, and how he has to deal with it. He'd been running from it. But Carla wouldn't let him continue to run in the end there. She maybe even loved him in the end, if not, she at the very least understood him. This movie is controversial, and it is disgustingly real at some parts. Fact is, Danny never hated the Jews completely, and in the end he hated himself more than he could have ever hated the Jews. Part of that hatred for himself was because he could never make himself fully hate the Jews and he couldn't ever bring himself to truly want them all annihilated. This duality is shown when he is picturing himself as the soldier killing the little boy and as the father who could do nothing to save his son. So yes, this is a well shot, well written, and well acted movie. But it is also a movie that will have you pondering it long after the credits have rolled.

Though there's intermittent laughs, the padding really shows in a story annoyingly full of itself.That goes double for Stiller, who thinks that playing his character as vain and narcissistic will keep us from noticing how vain and narcissistic Stiller himself can be. First, the whole movie exists to serve his image, which has him done up in all sorts of costumes and hair styles that show off his fine cheekbones and lean torso. Then he casts his family in key roles. His wife, the attractive if lightweight Christine Taylor, is the female lead and Derek's romantic interest. His father Jerry has the plum role of Derek's agent. Even his mother, Anne Meara, gets a quick, pointless cameo. Then there's his regular posse of friends who all seem to show up in each other's movies, like Owen Wilson as a rival model named Hansel and Will Ferrell as the villain Mugatu, who wears eyeliner and blonde ringlets which form the shape of a letter M.That's what's funny about this movie, the weird fashion. It serves the comedy well. The problem is that there are long sections where the fashion is the comedy, like Mugatu's odd sweaters and Derek wearing an all-white outfit to a funeral.Male models are dumb. That's the main joke, and while I'm happy to unfairly categorize any group of people I am insanely jealous of, it doesn't sustain 90 minutes of movie time. Nor does a strange espionage subplot where Derek is brainwashed to murder the prime minister of Malaysia. Some people like Roger Ebert attacked the film for trying to mine comedy from such a thing as the cruel reality of child labor, but the film's heart is in the right place. If it only had a brain...Watching this film once was amusing, but seeing it again reveals holes. Take Derek's brief trip back to his New Jersey hometown where his working class father and brothers are ashamed of Derek. This is hurt by the fact Jon Voight as the father has zero comedy presence in his scenes. Then there's a bit where Derek is consoled by Winona Ryder as Winona Ryder, which serves only to ring up another of the many cameos in this film, most ranging in character from obnoxious to repulsively inside. Even Paris Hilton says hello. I guess Stiller had a fun premiere night, and that may have been the point.Only two sequences hold up with repeat viewing, one a short bit where we meet and see off Derek's roommates, and another, shorter sequence where Hansel has a breakdance fight with an evil DJ. Ferrell's funny, too, but the film doesn't give him much of anything to do except bulge his eyes and say lines like That Hansel's so hot right now in a dry femmy voice. Because it's Ferrell, you laugh, but it's not a role of his worth remembering.The first time I saw it, I was about to go to a funeral, and I needed some dumb comedy. This fit the bill. Still, it was hard to understand why it was so popular when it came out. Then I checked its initial reviews and realized it was released in late September, 2001.

Though there's intermittent laughs, the padding really shows in a story annoyingly full of itself.That goes double for Stiller, who thinks that playing his character as vain and narcissistic will keep us from noticing how vain and narcissistic Stiller himself can be. First, the whole movie exists to serve his image, which has him done up in all sorts of costumes and hair styles that show off his fine cheekbones and lean torso. Then he casts his family in key roles. His wife, the attractive if lightweight Christine Taylor, is the female lead and Derek's romantic interest. His father Jerry has the plum role of Derek's agent. Even his mother, Anne Meara, gets a quick, pointless cameo. Then there's his regular posse of friends who all seem to show up in each other's movies, like Owen Wilson as a rival model named Hansel and Will Ferrell as the villain Mugatu, who wears eyeliner and blonde ringlets which form the shape of a letter M.That's what's funny about this movie, the weird fashion. It serves the comedy well. The problem is that there are long sections where the fashion is the comedy, like Mugatu's odd sweaters and Derek wearing an all-white outfit to a funeral.Male models are dumb. That's the main joke, and while I'm happy to unfairly categorize any group of people I am insanely jealous of, it doesn't sustain 90 minutes of movie time. Nor does a strange espionage subplot where Derek is brainwashed to murder the prime minister of Malaysia. Some people like Roger Ebert attacked the film for trying to mine comedy from such a thing as the cruel reality of child labor, but the film's heart is in the right place. If it only had a brain...Watching this film once was amusing, but seeing it again reveals holes. Take Derek's brief trip back to his New Jersey hometown where his working class father and brothers are ashamed of Derek. This is hurt by the fact Jon Voight as the father has zero comedy presence in his scenes. Then there's a bit where Derek is consoled by Winona Ryder as Winona Ryder, which serves only to ring up another of the many cameos in this film, most ranging in character from obnoxious to repulsively inside. Even Paris Hilton says hello. I guess Stiller had a fun premiere night, and that may have been the point.Only two sequences hold up with repeat viewing, one a short bit where we meet and see off Derek's roommates, and another, shorter sequence where Hansel has a breakdance fight with an evil DJ. Ferrell's funny, too, but the film doesn't give him much of anything to do except bulge his eyes and say lines like That Hansel's so hot right now in a dry femmy voice. Because it's Ferrell, you laugh, but it's not a role of his worth remembering.The first time I saw it, I was about to go to a funeral, and I needed some dumb comedy. This fit the bill. Still, it was hard to understand why it was so popular when it came out. Then I checked its initial reviews and realized it was released in late September, 2001. I guess we all needed some dumb comedy then.The world has changed, but not Zoolander. It's still dumb.

Concerning the end of the film, I think it strongly contrasts with the end of Chatiliez's two previous movies which presented the disintegration of two universes (the Le Quesnoy's one and Jean's one) whereas here, the movie ends on an image depicting Francis' new family looking happy and united in front of the farm, at dusk with Gérard repeating to his best friend enjoy my pal, enjoy...

For me and El Dorado, the attraction is being with old friends. That's how I look at the characters in this movie. Having seen the film several times, I'm so familiar with the plot and the characters that every new viewing is like visiting people I know and like.So what if El Dorado is based on, modeled after, lifted from, or a copy of, Rio Bravo? I let the movie stand on its own. Yes, there are weaknesses poor continuity, characters that seem out of place or poorly developed, and a scene that today would be considered politically incorrect. What movie doesn't have flaws? One aspect of the film that impressed me is the notion of professional courtesy as espoused by the bad gunman Nelse McLeod, played by Christopher George. The character is a thinking man's bad guy, one who is smart enough to know his limitations and respect another man's ability, even if (especially if?) that man is his enemy. McLeod's ability to look beyond the job at hand reminds me of the philosophical killer in Pulp Fiction. It's akin to the respect that opposing military officers have of each other in war.Every time I see El Dorado I enjoy it. Part of my enjoyment comes from thinking about what I was doing when this movie was made (1965-6).

An American pilot (Frank Sinatra) arrives in an Italian POW camp and finds himself the senior officer, in charge of a motley group of British prisoners under the command of Major Fincham (Trevor Howard). Sinatra and Howard clash, and eventually lead the prisoners in a daring take-over of their German prison train. With the help of a turncoat Italian officer (Sergio Fantoni) they point their loco towards neutral Switzerland.This is all pretty implausible, but its fairly entertainingly done. Sinatra does well with a surprisingly unsympathetic character, and his tetchy relationship with Howard provides much of the enjoyment of the film. Howard's role is relatively stereotyped, but he's a good enough actor to know this and still make his character believable. Director Mark Robson and his screenwriter Wendell Mayes have an understanding of British army attitudes that's obviously influenced by too many viewings of Bridge on the River Kwai. While Howard is a military martinet and a man of principle, it's Sinatra's practicality and collaboration with the enemy which initially brings the men dividends.However, Mayes and Robson have ensured that it's not quite as simple as all that and Sinatra is faced with some of the dilemmas of war which were explored a couple of years earlier in The Guns of Navarone, e.g. is it better to shoot an unarmed man or woman and save lives, or let them go and risk the lives of many more? Here though, screenwriter Mayes doesn't offer the easy solutions which undercut The Guns of Navarone. Sinatra's decision to let an Italian officer go free results in the death of some of his own men. Later on he's faced with the choice of shooting an unarmed woman in the back or risk compromising his escape plan.Unlike some of its contemporaries, Von Ryan's Express isn't afraid to kill off some of its major characters, and this at least stops things from getting too predictable. Although the supporting cast includes Wolfgang Preiss, John Leyton, Michael Goodliffe and Adolfo Celi, only Edward Mulhare, as the British padre who has to impersonate a German officer, gets a chance to really shine.Like a lot of war films of its era, some of the action scenes aren't all that realistic. When the heroes ambush a platoon of German soldiers in a tunnel, the Germans all collapse decorously to the ground as if they've just fainted. No mangled limbs or hideous death throes. It's one of those films where you suspect the Germans will get up and brush themselves off as soon as the camera stops rolling.Like The Train though, Von Ryan's Express benefits from using real trains (this time on the Italian railways) and a minimum of model work. This allows it to stand up pretty well for modern audiences. Many of the hazards faced by Sinatra and the others will be fairly familiar to anyone who's seen The Train or Northwest Frontier, but they're all produced with enthusiasm, and handled with some skill, and screenwriter Mayes ensures that there are still a few surprises in store.
