Haunting words from such a sweet and caring man. It's only three words but they leave an impact so great that nobody could possibly prepare for the consequences. These are the three words which define Philadelphia when Tom Hanks says them to Denzel Washington. The movie is about Andrew Beckett (Hanks), a homosexual man dying of AIDS, who feels he was fired from his job as a lawyer because of discrimination against him and his condition. Denzel Washington plays Joe Miller, the attorney who takes Beckett's case. He makes it clear from the start that he does not like homosexuals, but he does love the law and will put aside his prejudices to uphold justice. It isn't a bad thing to say that the highlight of this film is the performances given by these two fine actors.Philadelphia is an emotionally moving story, and Hanks and Washington deliver tenfold in their conflicting roles. Watching their relationship mature throughout the film is a heart wrenching delight for the audience. Because of these two immaculate characters, who seem to be completely opposite but are actually very similar, the film serves as a fantastic emotional treat. The story is rich with moral debate that deals with human nature and our prejudices against those who are different. The law firm that Beckett is fired from claims that they fired him for his incompetence and inability to act accordingly and to the best of his ability. But Beckett firmly believes that it is a deep seated bigotry that got him fired when the managers of the firm found out he had the deadly AIDS virus. This film beautifully raises awareness against prejudice and discrimination and makes a wonderful social statement that needs to be heard. And it is all done by the excellent and believably heartfelt performances from Hanks and Washington.The acting and social statements are the driving force behind Philadelphia. Most other aspects take a relative backseat to the important message brought up in this film. The direction and cinematography of this film seems odd at times and for some reason the director has an obsession with close ups. Hanks and Washington drive the character development of this film and the supporting cast, albeit necessary, don't seem to have the same richness and prevalence as the two leads. I said this is an emotional film, and it is, despite there being a few scenes that seem forced and only established for the purpose of having emotion, almost giving the feeling of force fed emotion. All of these are minor complaints that do not undermined the true integrity of this fine film.Philadelphia is a beautiful film that will be relevant for a long time to come. It has a strong heart that emanates an important message about discrimination and human rights. A great watch, if only for the fantastic performances and the strong ideals.

The Dead Zone is not one of them. This film is lackluster and devoid of any real emotion. It's very slow paced, which I can respect in a thriller, the problem being that this movie is not suspenseful or thrilling in any way. It is the story of a man named Johnny Smith (Christopher Walken) who gets into a horrible car accident. He wakes up five years later from a coma with the ability to see people's futures. He is struck with the moral debate of whether to help people with his newfound ability or to let the future be and hide away. The whole films strikes with an interesting concept, but unfortunately it is executed very poorly, and the whole idea becomes very mediocre and uninteresting.This film is very stale and static. It seems to never change tone or mood, staying at the same level of dull stagnancy. The plot seems to drag along with very little actually happening, and I found myself gradually losing interest. The characters follow the same pattern as the plot. There is little in the way of character development and I lost interest in all the characters by the end of the film. In fact, the characters don't do much to help the story along. The supporting cast is very weak, and most of the focus is on Christopher Walken's character. Walken does a decent job in his role, except that he has little to work with. His character only slightly changes throughout the film, and not for the better. He only gets less interesting and his psychic ability ends up boiling down to a neat trick that isn't really exciting anymore after the second or third time.The Dead Zone seems to be missing a spark of interest and intrigue that you would expect it to have. Everything here seems to be highly underdeveloped and it would have had a lot more potential if it had been properly executed and thoroughly fleshed out. This film is missing key elements to be a good film, and it could have been so much more. There isn't much use in watching this film.

It is just a little slow in the middle. The soundtrack is amazing and the visuals are top notch. There is a reason that Miyazaki is a god among animators, but I honestly think this is one of his weaker films. The characters are one of the most important thing for a movie for me and this movie did not have the strongest characters. I enjoyed them and I enjoyed the fact that Ashitaka was consistent when it came to his moral compass, but the arcs of any of the characters are almost non-existent. There are both scare and suspenseful moments followed by sweet moments that are really enjoyable. I guess the visuals and the universe Miyazaki created is what makes this movie so special. Unfortunately I did not every connect with any of the characters. I think he does a better job with delivering his message with other movies without it being so in your face. It is a great movie, but I do not think it deserves classic status.

John Wayne's mission to lead a troop of Yankee soldiers behind Confederate lines to destroy a railway base vital to the South's supply lines is fraught with danger. Skirmishes inevitably result in injuries and death, the former often giving rise to amputations. Although made well before the time that the full appalingness of warfare come to be depicted in films such as Saving Captain Ryan, from Drums Along the Mohawk onwards Ford never shirked the unpleasant. Incurable romantic that he was, he gave his work a hard edge whenever it was needed. Although the term road movie to categorise films based on journeys was not then in general usage, this fascinating work, with horses replacing cars, stands as one of the genres finest examples. And yet, judging from many of this site's user comments, it remains one of Ford's most under appreciated films. I find this rather strange as it contains most of the ingredients that are the hallmarks of those generally regarded as masterworks, westerns such as The Searchers, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and My Darling Clementine, not forgetting his glorious Irish romp, The Quiet Man. A shrew is tamed, there is a measure of drunken knockabout and the soundtrack pulsates with rousing cavalry tunes and bugle calls. I have no quarrel with the fact that it is episodic rather than tightly knit. This somehow makes it all the more compatible with its journeying structure. Each episode on the way is brought out in sharp relief, be it the Southern belle's false hospitality and attempted betrayal, the central climax at the railroad station or the delightful interlude of the attack by the boy soldiers from the Confederate military academy (one of my favourite sequences from any Ford film). John Wayne plays what is almost a variation on his Ethan role in The Searchers, his anger here not vent on Indians but on the medical profession which he holds responsible for his wife's death. His embittered relationship with his company's medical officer played by William Holden gives this otherwise picaresque film a strong dramatic unity. I can only advise those who consider this one of Ford's minor works to see it several times. From my own experience I find it emerges stronger on each viewing.

Who knows why people do what they do? Nobody knows that, but she's... she's a good person.¨ The Champ has divided audiences over the world; there are those who consider this to be a masterpiece and others who believe it's just a terrible movie that tries too hard to be a tearjerker. I wouldn't agree with either statement, the movie isn't a masterpiece, but it isn't terrible either. It has it's touching moments with a good performance from Jon Voight as the lead actor. I did have some issues with the child actor, Rick Schroder, but it had more to do with the material he had to work with than anything else. The producers tried too hard in making him look so cute that his character lost credibility. This 1979 film, directed by Franco Zeffirelli, is actually a remake of a 1931 movie of the same name directed by King Vidor and written by Frances Marion. So remakes have been a part of Hollywood for years now, it's not something new like many people might think. The screenplay for this film was adapted by Walter Newman and in my opinion it is the weakest part of the movie. The script doesn't feel real, it is overly dramatic and I just couldn't make sense of several scenes. For example, there is one scene where Voight's character abandons his son in a boxing gym to grab some drinks in a bar. The kid ends up alone trying to figure out where his father went and deduces he is probably at a nearby bar. I know there might be some parents that would do this, but I doubt they could have raised their child as well as Schroder's character seems to have been raised. His love and passion for his father, the champ, is hard to believe because he seems so selfish and cruel at times.The story takes place in Hialeah where Billy Flynn (Jon Voight), a former boxing champ now in his late thirty's, is working as a race horse trainer. He lives with his seven year old son, T.J. (Rick Schroder), who absolutely worships his father and calls him the champ. Billy raises his son on his own since his mother abandoned them when T.J. was born, although he has told his son that she passed away. T.J. seems to be more mature then his father and is always cleaning after his mess. Billy dreams of making a comeback in boxing, but he suffered a head injury that made him abandon the sport. He also is a compulsive gambler and alcoholic. One day he even steals money from his son's allowance in order to gamble. This time however, Billy wins a lot of money and decides to buy his son a race horse after feeling guilty for what he did. T.J. names his horse She's A Lady and takes her to the race tracks where he meets a lovely woman named Annie (Faye Dunaway). When Annie runs into Billy she realizes that T.J. is the son she has abandoned and now wants to make up for what she has done. Annie is a successful designer who is married to a wealthy doctor. At first Billy doesn't want anything to do with her and insists in not letting his son know she's alive, but due to his gambling problems he will be forced to. The only solution Billy can think of in order to give his son a better future is returning to what he does best boxing.The Champ relies too heavily on the dramatic effect and that is what ends up hurting the movie because many scenes seem to fit the screenplay for the convenience of the movie and it just doesn't feel real. There are some strong scenes, which I agree were well acted like the prison scene or the final scene, but there were others that felt phony and overacted, like the scene where T.J. screams at Annie in the boat. My biggest disappointment was that I felt T.J. to be a one dimensional character. He was there to make the movie look cute and make the audience sympathize with him. Billy, on the other hand, was a character we sometimes despised and at others loved and identified with. Audiences that enjoy heartfelt films and tearjerkers will probably love this movie, but audiences who are searching for more character depth will probably be disappointed with it. I had a hard time with the beginning of the film, and found the last half of the movie more entertaining, but it is far from being the masterpiece some people claim it to be.http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"17 August 2010","score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" ¨We did some silly things.

So remakes have been a part of Hollywood for years now, it's not something new like many people might think. The screenplay for this film was adapted by Walter Newman and in my opinion it is the weakest part of the movie. The script doesn't feel real, it is overly dramatic and I just couldn't make sense of several scenes. For example, there is one scene where Voight's character abandons his son in a boxing gym to grab some drinks in a bar. The kid ends up alone trying to figure out where his father went and deduces he is probably at a nearby bar. I know there might be some parents that would do this, but I doubt they could have raised their child as well as Schroder's character seems to have been raised. His love and passion for his father, the champ, is hard to believe because he seems so selfish and cruel at times.The story takes place in Hialeah where Billy Flynn (Jon Voight), a former boxing champ now in his late thirty's, is working as a race horse trainer. He lives with his seven year old son, T.J. (Rick Schroder), who absolutely worships his father and calls him the champ. Billy raises his son on his own since his mother abandoned them when T.J. was born, although he has told his son that she passed away. T.J. seems to be more mature then his father and is always cleaning after his mess. Billy dreams of making a comeback in boxing, but he suffered a head injury that made him abandon the sport. He also is a compulsive gambler and alcoholic. One day he even steals money from his son's allowance in order to gamble. This time however, Billy wins a lot of money and decides to buy his son a race horse after feeling guilty for what he did. T.J. names his horse She's A Lady and takes her to the race tracks where he meets a lovely woman named Annie (Faye Dunaway). When Annie runs into Billy she realizes that T.J. is the son she has abandoned and now wants to make up for what she has done. Annie is a successful designer who is married to a wealthy doctor. At first Billy doesn't want anything to do with her and insists in not letting his son know she's alive, but due to his gambling problems he will be forced to. The only solution Billy can think of in order to give his son a better future is returning to what he does best boxing.The Champ relies too heavily on the dramatic effect and that is what ends up hurting the movie because many scenes seem to fit the screenplay for the convenience of the movie and it just doesn't feel real. There are some strong scenes, which I agree were well acted like the prison scene or the final scene, but there were others that felt phony and overacted, like the scene where T.J. screams at Annie in the boat. My biggest disappointment was that I felt T.J. to be a one dimensional character. He was there to make the movie look cute and make the audience sympathize with him. Billy, on the other hand, was a character we sometimes despised and at others loved and identified with. Audiences that enjoy heartfelt films and tearjerkers will probably love this movie, but audiences who are searching for more character depth will probably be disappointed with it. I had a hard time with the beginning of the film, and found the last half of the movie more entertaining, but it is far from being the masterpiece some people claim it to be.http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Drama, Sport"},{"date":"17 August 2010","score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" ¨We did some silly things. Who knows why people do what they do? Nobody knows that, but she's... she's a good person.¨ The Champ has divided audiences over the world; there are those who consider this to be a masterpiece and others who believe it's just a terrible movie that tries too hard to be a tearjerker. I wouldn't agree with either statement, the movie isn't a masterpiece, but it isn't terrible either. It has it's touching moments with a good performance from Jon Voight as the lead actor. I did have some issues with the child actor, Rick Schroder, but it had more to do with the material he had to work with than anything else.

I also firmly believe, and this is my opinion, that it is the second best film of 1968 after 2001. It has everything, wonderful performances, superb dialogue, an intriguing story, a beautiful score and adept direction, in short what more can you ask for? The story of The Lion in Winter is a great one to work from, and one that works wonderfully. It is set mostly in the austere castle ramparts over the Christmas festival, yet it is also a story of a family squabble that has geopolitical import, in other words the Medieval Dymnastic War. The sets, scenery and costumes are exquisite, and John Barry's score is breathtakingly beautiful and suitably melancholic. The direction is excellent, and while the film is over 2 hours it never feels as though it's dragging.In fact thanks to primarily the script and performances it is utterly riveting. The dialogue, what can I say? Can I coin the phrase among the best ever written? The dialogue is so good, and sparkles constantly, not to mention memorable and incredibly thought-provoking. The performances especially from the two leads are brilliant. Katherine Hepburn is a revelation as the skillful and consummate Eleanor, while a deliciously robust Peter O'Toole gives one of his best performances as Henry II.

His talent is not limited to the incredible film work he has accomplished as a versatile actor, but is fast becoming a notable screenwriter. This story is an example of his ability. The Movie is called  Kiss of the Dragon  and was penned by Li himself. The director for this film is Chris Nahon and his efforts have produced a superb and memorable hit for action fans everywhere. The story is inviting from it's inception. Liu Jian (Jet Li) is an able undercover police Inspector who arrives in Paris France, to learn who is behind the drug smuggling between China and France. Once there, he is met by French Inspector Richard (Tchéky Karyo) who allows him to supervise the murder of 'Mr. Big' (Ric Young). However, once the event is recorded by hidden cameras, the murder is quickly subverted and the blame for the dead victim is shifted to Inspector Jian. Realizing he has been set up as a fall guy, Jian must escape and find a way to clear himself of the crime. To do this he enlists the help of a Parisian Whore named Jessica Kamen (Bridget Fonda) who's kidnapped daughter is threatened with death. Together they must escape the assault of the Paris Cops and Richards' expert goons. The experience cast includes some very impressive Martial Arts scenes by actors like Laurence Ashley, Cyril Raffaelli\/Didier Azoulay as the twins and Max Ryan as Lupo. Nearly the entire film from beginning to end is one dramatic, exciting roller-coaster ride of action and skilled fights scenes. Todate, this has got to be Jet Li's best film yet.
