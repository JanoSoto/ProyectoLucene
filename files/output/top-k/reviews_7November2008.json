Produced in the wake of The Caesar Hour and Your Show of Shows, Mad World spawns from a comedic style born on Vaudeville and lived on briefly through television and movies via Milton Berle, Mel Brooks, Bob Hope, Jonathan Winters, Harvey Corman, Tim Conway, Sid Caesar, Carol Burnett and many others. The comedy caper sub-genre enjoyed a brief stint from the 1960's into the 1980's, ending with the Cannon Ball Run movies. Today, however, contrived comedy of this sort wears thin and has not withstood very well. It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World was probably the beginning and end of comedy-caper with a Vaudveillian cast (and you can see why), and the comedy-variety TV show ended when the Carol Burnett Show aired for the last time in the 1970's.The formula is almost too contrived for its own good. A diverse group of misfit characters, usually played by Hollywood comedic name talent shown in little boxes on the poster, find out about some booty. They all go on a mad-cap chase and\/or adventure to grab the booty before the others do. And this movie is brimming with so many recognizable names, it's starts sounding like a Who's Who of Trivial Pursuit Comedy Edition Milton Berle, Buddy Hackett, Ethel Merman, Sid Caesar, Jim Bachus, Jonathan Winters, Mickey Rooney, Phil Silvers, and scores of others. Even more have uncredited cameos like Jack Benny, Carl Reiner and Jerry Lewis. And of course the characters are little caricatures. Jonathan Winters plays a truck driver not playing with a full deck. Milton Berle is supposed to be a successful businessman who would rather be on his yacht. And Ethel Merman plays his never-ending nagging wife who gets the nickname old bag, and deservedly so. At one point I just started fast-forwarding her dialog! Spencer Tracy plays a cop who is tracking the party of misfits, and he often throws his hat out of the window, as if that's funny. It get's run over by Jerry Lewis, in probably his most outstanding screen performance since it's the only scene he's in.This merry band of idiots that would make the Adams Family look like Oxford Professors comes upon a dying man (Jimmy Durante) who just crashed over the side of the road. Why an 80-year-old man was going 150 miles an hour through mountainous terrain in an American car is almost as big a mystery as to why the acting is so bad. He reveals that there is $350,000 stashed underneath a W, which we assume is not the middle initial of a certain bad president. Of course, he doesn't ask them to give a message to any loved ones, or to get an ambulance. When he croaks, the cops come, and the group can't decide if Durante died immediately or if was a raving lunatic. It becomes clear that these marginal human beings, played by actors who probably made many times the amount of the booty, are out to get their share of the loot.The problem with this kind of caper comedy is that it tries to be funny, akin to a Vaudeville act where two dingbats try to outdo each other with top hat and cane all the while falling over one another to the accompaniment of cymbals crashing. I've seen 12-year-olds make up stuff that's far more amusing. If you like the rather silly Vaudevillan humor that adorned the stages of theaters back in the early 20th century, Mad Mad World is a throw-back to that era. However, for younger audiences who need comedy with more of a modern edge, like Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, Robin Williams, or Steve Martin, Mad Mad World seems like a mishmash of unintelligent ridiculousness.

The movie changes its style and tone too often and toward the end the movie is sort of 'loosing' it.The movie begins as such a fun and adventurous movie, with a great story that showed even more potential. But it's more than a fun movie its also a clever one, that is multiple layered. For instance the movie can also been really watched as one about learning about yourself and live, when a successful Hollywood director goes undercover as an hobo to learn what it means to get in trouble and to live with no help from anyone and without all the money, so he can direct a tough drama he has set his mind on.But the movie in the end is all about laughing and being happy. The movie is an homage to those who makes us laugh, which comes across a bit odd to me honestly. Seriously why dedicate a movie to a thing like that? Perhaps it was because there was a world war going on at the time? I don't know but it just seems like a silly thing to me.So the movie has two contrasts in it, happy silly comedy and some tough serious drama with a message to it. I must say that this approach works out fine for most part of the movie but toward the end the movie is sort of loosing it, when its story starts to make some rather awkward turns and the comedy almost completely disappears out of the movie.It nevertheless remains a well written movie, with also some fine comical dialog in it. I love '40's movies for often featuring this style of dialog. It becomes a huge part of the movie its comedy itself. But also the psychical comedy itself is great, though I wish the entire movie was more like its first 20 minutes or so. That way this movie surely would had been one of the most amusing ones I have seen in my life.Joel McCrea is a rather unknown actor and one that acted mostly in western's throughout his career but he is really great in this movie. He looks something like the young Paul Newman but of course acts in a more comical way as he does. He was real fine in this movie and it's a bit of a shame that he never really fully broke through as an actor, or won any big important awards during his career. He worked more with director Preston Sturges after this movie but not even he could lift him to stardom.Veronica Lake was surely one beautiful woman but her acting at times sort of tends to get annoying. She gets her cheeks tightly together when she speaks, or at least she sounds like that. Oh well, at least her looks really saves her performance and ensures that she is a pleasant addition to this movie.A real mixed bag this one.

Zombie was decent and had a couple of moments but didn't impress, its sequel Zombie 3 was atrocious and New York Ripper, while entertaining, felt hollow and without any real grip of terror consistently. With the Beyond it's a whole other matter, and it's finally clear what (some of) the hubbub is about the prolific Italian master of the Giallo. He actually makes, for one, the story somewhat more interesting than most horror films, nevermind Italian, as if it's a descendant of Lovecraft; some of this, in all actuality minus the crazy gore, could make something for a Val Lewton script. But aside from the story, which in all actuality Fulci as never been totally concerned with, his powers as director are at their peak. There's things like, well, atmosphere and terror from the Louisiana locations and lighting in those subterranean quarters near the 'gate' of hell, and, of course, the manic gore.What surprised me most of all though after the fact of Fulci more than proving himself as a near-virtuoso with the camera and moments of great suspense (maybe not quite Argento but close enough), was how scary the film turned out to be. This is most recommendable of all it's not simply one of those guilty pleasure exports in the genre, but a legitimate work of terror out of things as simple as ghosts and demons from hell and curses and that place has been abandoned for 50 years... What starts from the set-up in the premise - a woman, Liza (Katherine MacColl) inherits a decrepit Lousiana hotel that happens to lead into one of the seven gates of hell (or maybe all seven, I lost cont) - unravels into a series of murders, shocks, attacks, spooky wanderings with the blind woman and her dog, shenanigans and rot at the morgue. And never once is something far too cheesy, save for one or two shots from the gun in the climax, or too far into the realm of it being so-bad-it's-good like in other Fulci films. This time, it's just good.So good that it should please even today's I-can-take-anything-you-dish-out horror fans. Although characterization is at a reasonable two-dimensional limit, it is never a distraction; on the contrary the horror perfectly streams out of this increasingly nightmarish place where just the introduction of the blind woman and her dog in the road is one thing... and then the eventual undoing of her with the dog something else (the kind of scene, I should add, that reminds one of I Am Legend only with *more* horror-cajones). And characteristic for an Itallian splatter pic there's gore, lots of it, usually around popping eyeballs or close-ups of gashing flesh- the sepia-toned opening crucifixion is just one such fantastically over-indulgent treat- only with the Beyond Fulci tries out some things that gain their power from the cranked-up what-the-hell factor, such as the little girl in the autopsy room walking back away from the flowing pool of blood\/whatever.The Beyond isn't for the squeamish, or for the easily frightened. It's a movie for hardcore fans of the genre, and more specifically Giallo-geeks. Its truly a fantastic piece of exploitation-as-art, where such a scene as the ending, which would never be seen done as well as in a more average or less ambitious production, displays what a director like Fulci could do when put to the extremes of his talent. I'm not sure if he's a great director like Argento yet (certainly he gives other misogynists a run for their money), but he's attracted my attention more than ever to his oeuvre.

Its truly a fantastic piece of exploitation-as-art, where such a scene as the ending, which would never be seen done as well as in a more average or less ambitious production, displays what a director like Fulci could do when put to the extremes of his talent. I'm not sure if he's a great director like Argento yet (certainly he gives other misogynists a run for their money), but he's attracted my attention more than ever to his oeuvre.

So there's no reason why this wouldn't generate a significant cult following, as viewers would flock to it 'just because...'.The movie itself, shot entirely in black-and-white, is pretty decent. The screen writing is above par and goes to great lengths to examine the complexities of directing and producing a movie with little or no capital at one's disposal. Tim Burton was suitably billed to direct this feature, and his homage to the vintage science-fiction\/horror is a testament to fine movie-making. To me, Burton is just one of those guys who revels in the extraordinary.Johnny Depp is brilliant as the cross-dressing, mediocre writer\/director\/producer\/actor Ed Wood who became renowned for the unbelievable speed with which he shot movies (not bothering to re-shoot scenes even where there are obvious flaws), but to me, the real star of the show is Martin Landau, who plays the once famous Bela Lugosi, a man who is now aging, addicted to morphine, and haunted by loneliness and lost fame. Landau deservedly picked up an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and, as Lugosi, steals almost every scene in which he appears, such that there is a considerable drop-off in excitement every time the movie switches focus away from his character. This leads me to wonder if the film should have focused more on Lugosi than Wood...The costume design, set design, and makeup are simply superb, and the Oscar won for Best Makeup was well-justified. Film-makers in the future would do well to follow the design aspects of this Motion Picture.In conclusion, the movie is slightly better-than-good, but rarely reaches the pinnacles of greatness. The nature of the subject will undoubtedly continue to draw a serious cult following and it is no surprise that this movie is featured in IMDb's Top 250 (as I write it stands at #192). The movie is quite entertaining and watchable for most of its ~125 minute run-time.Deserving of 3 stars (out of 4) and a rating of 8\/10.

Unaware, that is, until he meets a beautiful working class woman and follows her into the depths of the city. There he sees the conditions under which the working class labors and his sense of social justice is awakened. At the same time, an inventor has been working on creating a race of artificial people and the working class has been planning revolution. This is discovered when Freder trades places with a worker and visits the deeper underground where his beloved Maria is preaching a message of hope. There the two of them discover their purpose in life. But of course that is not the end of the story. I won't give away more except to say that Freder's father, the inventor Rotwang and the created Machine-Man cause conflict which builds steadily to an exciting climax.There is a scene where one of the machines is overheating and the viewer feels the suspense and tension as the thermometer rises and the worker tries desperately to avoid disaster without effect followed by the image of countless workers sacrificed to Moloch (beautiful transformation from machine to demon) and then simply replaced by more drones. The special effects and stunts of this scene are wonderful. Later on there are some really wonderful special effects in the creation\/transformation of the Machine-Man, which are incredible considering the time period in which this was filmed. And the wonder just continues in other scenes-a frightening scene as death descends upon the city.The drably uniformed mass of workers is contrasted with the privileged upper class who, while similar, have the opportunity to be more individuals. The workers are portrayed as simply parts of the machines they service and not as people at all, down to the detail of the workers having only numbers, not names. This would seem to be a good description of the difference between the classes in the rise of the Industrial Revolution, but sadly it doesn't seem so different even now in the Information Age. The plight of the working class is just emphasized by the desperation of Josaphat when he is dismissed by the Master of Metropolis and attempts to kill himself rather than go work in the depths. His despair is portrayed well. The acting is superb.This film is rife with social commentary, and religious images, most of which portray the ruling class to various demons and warns against the dangers of the abuse of power and technology including its dehumanizing effects. But true religion is also portrayed as saving in this film. This is all presented in a very stylized and expressionistic way with exaggerated but beautiful sets, excellent use of contrast (especially between the extravagant luxury of the Club of the Sons and the stark efficiency of the underworld) and a story that keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat waiting to see what happens.The Kino DVD edition I watched has a very good quality of picture transfer, and though I gather that no version of the film is now complete, this one seems to flow well and it s hard to tell that scenes are missing because of the skillful use of inter titles. The music used in this version is fitting and adds to the overall effect of the film. I have no idea how similar or different it is to the score that would have been originally provided.This is a wonderful movie that has easily withstood the ravages of time and I highly recommend it-not because it is important (though I gather it is an important film historically) but simply because it is entertaining.

Broccoli and his stepson Michael G. Wilson not only created one of the best Bond films in the franchise, but also a very good stand-alone spy thriller. Furthermore, it is not loosely based on Ian Fleming's characters. No, the short novel 'The Living Daylights' has been brought to the screen in perfect detail.The pre-credits sequence is easily one of the best in the franchise. No stand-ins for newcomer Timothy Dalton. He does the amazing but also credible, believable stunts all by himself. The one-car chase works perfectly and John Barry's modern touch of the Bond theme add's great suspense to it. One of the best Bond openers, together with the pre-credits sequence from 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', 'The Spy Who Loved Me', 'Moonraker' and 'The World Is Not Enough'.After the simple, minimalistic main titles from Maurice Binder and A-Ha's amazing Bond tune (Alicia Keys and Jack White must have forgotten to write a terrific tune\/melody), Ian Fleming's short story kicks in in which Bond spies on what seems to be a KGB sniper (Kara Milovy). M's orders are clear Helping General Georgi Koskov to defect to the UK. Also an important storyline in Fleming's short story.It is here where espionage kicks in. By now the audience begins to think Gogol's successor Leonid Pushkin is the real villain. The people responsible for the script want us to believe that Pushkin re-introduces the good old SM(i)ER(t)S(pionnom)H spy assassination lists introduced in 'From Russia With Love'. And Georgi Koskov is the one wanting to escape Pushkin's deadly hands. M's answer to 007 Kill Pushkin.But Bond is Bond and he senses trouble. He has a nose for these kind of intelligent schemes and soon he finds out the defection is a big bogus. It was merely an power-hungry attempt of Koskov to bump Pushkin from his trone. And by doing so giving his close ally Whitaker full opportunity to expand his weapons deals. Ultimately, the scheme also foresees in making the British Secret Service look like an incompetent organization. And suddenly, the good old Soviet Union again looks like the 'most dangerous nation on Eath'. Ingenious.Off course Koskov and Whitaker's scheme falters and soon Pushkin and Bond team up. It is here where we see remarkable similarities with that other spy thriller 'From Russia With Love' in which the villains are shady characters with grey character traits. Where Whitaker and Koskov team up in this film, Rosa Klebb and Kronsteen team up in 'From Russia With Love'. And both duo's are supported by a menacing henchman Necros and Grant.Necros is both handsome and deadly as we can see in MI6's Blayden residence. The fight scenes are awesome and jaw-breaking. Soon the same Necros is fighting again, but this time in the Hercules plane, with Her Majesty's Agent 007. It's easily a great action sequence. Possibly the highlight of the film. The other highlight of the film is the well-performed car chase between Bond's Aston Martin (first time since 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service') and the Chechslovakian Lada's. Again, John Barry's music really brings great suspense to these action sequences.Kara Milovy is the more emotionally involved Bond girl who's playing a Stradivarius cello. She's not a dumb bimbo, like Stacey Sutton was in 'A View To A Kill'. Kara falls in love with James Bond but at times is also helping the villains by drugging Bond with a dirty Martini, just like she helped the villains with a sniper rifle filled with dummies. She's merely a tool for the villains, just like Tanya was in 'From Russia With Love'.Unfortunately, as a Bond girl she is not as good as Tanya. Perhaps because she looks a bit too dreadful in her shoulder filled eighties outfits and her Soviet bob line haircut. And although the villains, Whitaker, Koskov and Necros, have some great intelligent schemes to fulfill, they don't look as menacing as Rosa Klebb, Kronsteen and Grant. Perhaps Koskov and Whitaker needed a well organized crime syndicate to support their plans, like SPECTRE or QUANTUM.Having said that, 'The Living Daylights' was a delightful Bond film after Moore's disaster in 'A View To A Kill'. Timothy Dalton portrays a human spy and not an Austin Powers-like clown. He's cold-blooded and quite rough, just like Ian Fleming wanted. 19 years later Daniel Craig performs a similar James Bond that is even more cold blooded. 'The Living Daylights' is, together with 'From Russia With Love', 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', 'For Your Eyes Only' and 'Casino Royale' one of the best Bond films of the franchise.

I wasn't even alive in 1951, so I did not have the honor to appreciate this film when it was most relevant (of course, it still is in 2008). One could call this film liberal, peace-loving hogwash, but to do so is to miss the point entirely. It doesn't matter whether you're conservative or liberal; we're all human beings and we must share this planet together, or face obliteration, which is the dilemma facing spaceman Klaatu (the great British actor Michael Rennie), who has come to Earth with a message for all the world's leaders to hear. But Cold War tensions make such a meeting impossible. In the haste of his arrival in Washington, D.C., overzealous soldiers wound Klaatu and only his commands keep his massive robot companion Gort (Lock Martin) from destroying all that stands in his master's way. Klaatu soon escapes the hospital he's sent to, and takes up residence in a boarding house, under the name Mr. Carpenter, where he befriends a widow (Patricia Neal) and her son (Billy Gray). Mr. Carpenter takes it upon himself to locate a renowned professor (Sam Jaffe) in an effort to bring the scientific community's greatest minds together to hear his message of world peace or face annihilation. Meanwhile, a city-wide search is organized by the police and military to find the spaceman, who has been immediately perceived as a threat. The late, great director Robert Wise took on the task of bringing this cinematic adaptation of the Harry Bates short story Farewell to the Master to the screen all those years ago. This is one of my all-time favorite sci-fi movies, though it does not appear on my list of top-10 sci-fi films; I have, however, given it an honorary place on my list, based solely on message and content alone. The acting is perfect from the cast, especially Michael Rennie, whose gentlemanly spaceman is one of the great characters in science fiction, and a great departure from other screen spacemen who were simply played for laughs. I have no doubts that this film would later serve as a key inspiration on filmmaker James Cameron's similar-themed anti-war sci-fi picture The Abyss (1989), which is also amongst one of my favorite sci-fi pictures of all time.This is a film for the ages and should be required viewing for all true fans of the science fiction genre.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 November 2008","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" The Day the Earth Stood Still is still one of the greatest sci-fi movies over half a century after its release.

It doesn't matter whether you're conservative or liberal; we're all human beings and we must share this planet together, or face obliteration, which is the dilemma facing spaceman Klaatu (the great British actor Michael Rennie), who has come to Earth with a message for all the world's leaders to hear. But Cold War tensions make such a meeting impossible. In the haste of his arrival in Washington, D.C., overzealous soldiers wound Klaatu and only his commands keep his massive robot companion Gort (Lock Martin) from destroying all that stands in his master's way. Klaatu soon escapes the hospital he's sent to, and takes up residence in a boarding house, under the name Mr. Carpenter, where he befriends a widow (Patricia Neal) and her son (Billy Gray). Mr. Carpenter takes it upon himself to locate a renowned professor (Sam Jaffe) in an effort to bring the scientific community's greatest minds together to hear his message of world peace or face annihilation. Meanwhile, a city-wide search is organized by the police and military to find the spaceman, who has been immediately perceived as a threat. The late, great director Robert Wise took on the task of bringing this cinematic adaptation of the Harry Bates short story Farewell to the Master to the screen all those years ago. This is one of my all-time favorite sci-fi movies, though it does not appear on my list of top-10 sci-fi films; I have, however, given it an honorary place on my list, based solely on message and content alone. The acting is perfect from the cast, especially Michael Rennie, whose gentlemanly spaceman is one of the great characters in science fiction, and a great departure from other screen spacemen who were simply played for laughs. I have no doubts that this film would later serve as a key inspiration on filmmaker James Cameron's similar-themed anti-war sci-fi picture The Abyss (1989), which is also amongst one of my favorite sci-fi pictures of all time.This is a film for the ages and should be required viewing for all true fans of the science fiction genre.10\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"7 November 2008","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The Princess and The Warrior is a dreamy, atmospheric, twisted, (elegantly) awkward and sometimes violent take on a love story. It draws you into its world, captivates you, floats you on its cloud, makes you feel you are there in this alternate universe- a universe you've certainly never experienced before. I've seen many films, perhaps even hundreds, but never have I seen a film quite like this. It truly was like entering another universe only Tykwer himself could have though up... And a surreal one at that. And yet, unlike most 'surreal' films, it is human enough so that you, too, feel and move with the characters. It had me bawling at its profound beauty during one instance. This, like the infamous AMELIE, is one of those romance films where everything is to be felt, rather than visualized. By this, I mean that, like Amelie, The Princess and The Warrior displays very little of what every other 'romance' film feels the need to do... There is little (if not any... but I'll let you watch the film to find out) touching, kissing, sex etc. And yet, this somehow makes it all the more effective, and ultimately, one of the most heart-wrenchingly romantic films I've ever seen.This is no trendy, action-packed 'Run Lola Run'. It is certainly stylized as all of Tykwer's films (that I've seen) are, but less blatantly and pretentiously so. But even though many were disappointed at it not being another version of Run Lola Run, I personally found 'The Princess and The Warrior' to be much more of an evolved film... perhaps a bit slower, but much smarter, more profound, and ultimately a film that gets down to the core of your bones and leaves a lasting imprint.

It begins as a POW story during World War II, in German occupied Italy. The camp is close to being liberated. There are shades of the River Kwai in this movie, only with the other Axis power. And Sinatra's character is savvy enough to realize they are lucky not to be prisoners in Japan, where the treacherous Buddhist policy of working prisoners and slaves to death is in force. Sinatra is the American who is somewhat like Holden's character in his zest for life, and Howard is the British character, as hard bitten as Hawkins and Guiness in the Kwai movie. Sinatra, however, outranks Howard. He makes decisions that are usually right, but don't work out in these cases. For example, Howard wants to kill a POW, and Sinatra knows this is illegal. Under most circumstances, this wouldn't bit them in the nose, but in a Hollywood movie, any act of mercy is bound to be treated with bad karma. The prisoners are liberated, and attempt to avoid recapture on an odyssey aboard a train. Another Hollywood add on is the necessity to kill a brunette woman, which is quite common among the Nazi film makers of a past era. The logic for this killing is still elusive, as the man who shoots her doesn't want to kill her, yet for some reason shoots to kill instead of to the legs. The movie tries to show Howard's character is always right, but has to bend all the events and occurrences into the favor of this. It is quite contrived. There are good prisoner of war scenes, and some interesting characters along the way. I gave it a 5 out of 10. Somewhat good, somewhat disappointing. The final scene, however, makes up for most of the detriments, as it is one of the greatest Hollywood film endings ever, and a directorial triumph.

Then I saw a documentary about this picture and it came clear to me. Here glimpses of deleted material provided hints that Topaz used to be stronger and more congruent than it is now. Nevertheless I have to add it doesn't look like this original version had the greatness to become a classic.It seems to me like Hitchcock at several moments lost his movie on his quest for compromise between his idea and the preferences of the audience. The result leaves many question-marks. Topaz doesn't run as smooth as former Hitchcocks. Referring to the documentation for Topaz the audience wanted it shorter. Possibly it was too long, but I'd say it's difficult to leave scenes out without losing too important info... as happened here ! Further more from what I've seen from the deleted material I can understand why the audience didn't enjoy the original ending but it was still way better and clearer than the current one. Summing up Topaz (1969) based on a novel was meant to be different. I doubt it could have been a classic but it could have become a far better film. This official version is no complete let-down but considering that it was directed by Hitchcock it is disappointing.
