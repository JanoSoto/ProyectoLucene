Klute is one of those movies that did it for me. This is a very atmospheric thriller at its best. It has some of the best actors in it. It is handled with extreme care from a director that really does know how to make a thriller work. And it is very well written with rich and sharp dialogue.Jane Fonda plays Bree Daniels. She's a struggling woman, trying to live a double life. In the daytime, she's a person, struggling to be an actress or a model. At night or during her free time, she's a call girl. Donald Sutherland plays John Klute, the title character. He's a small town detective who's assigned to look for a man that went missing for a couple of months. His only hope is Bree. But, one thing stands in their way. There's a anonymous man, stalking Bree. On several occasions, she gets a telephone call at night and when she picks up the phone, she can hear nothing. Most of the time, she can hear the man breathing through the phone. Knowing that she's in danger, Klute decides to protect Bree from the pervert who has already killed two women. There's isn't really any background information on the killer. But, one thing is for sure. The man that is stalking Bree is a lot closer than she thinks. In my opinion, the movie is more focused on Bree rather than Klute. I believe the movie's title should have been called Bree, instead of Klute. Because after all, the movie does a very good job creating a slice of life feeling of Bree. She is alone and also desperate since she lives a double life, both as a prostitute and as a single woman. Her pimp, (Roy Scheider), is a lowlife who gives little to no information on Klute's investigation. But even though this is Bree's show, Klute soon starts to care and also falls in love with her. The relationship between the two lead actors is a very interesting aspect to the story. We really do sympathizes with these characters because we know that they are in danger of being seen or stalked.The movie has a uneasy atmospheric feeling to it, especially in one scene, where Sutherland's character hears noises on Bree's roof and he goes to check it out and notice just how dark this movie is lit. It is almost as if the dark is use as a camouflage to the killer. While I was watching that scene, I realize that I was grabbing onto the edge of my seat, trying to figure out what is going happened. It's that kind of feeling that I get from thrillers that make them so watchable. The director, Alan J. Pakula, certainly knows how to keep his audience at ease with the growing sense of dread. It is not at all predictable. There are terrifying shots of a hand, squeezing onto a chain-linked fence. And when I saw those shots, I held onto my breath in suspense.Jane Fonda has never given an better performance than this. She definitely deserves winning the Oscar for Best Actress that year. I truly believe in her character's willingness to be a victim of being stalked. I like how Pakula is able to have a strong actress played Bree because in the best thrillers of this kind, the stronger actress is, the more believable the character is. Fonda is perhaps, the most strongest actress out there that can really tackle this role. I was amazed just how real her character was. In addition to that, I also want to give Donald Sutherland credit for playing the title character. He is sort of a protector for Bree. He is also trying to fit in with the culture aspects of New York City. You might think that the back half of the story is a fish out of water story. But it isn't. The two lead actors are very good together and their stories are very well written with authenticity.Pakula certainly does know to photographed New York City very vividly. With the help of cinematographer Gordon Willis, these two can really bring New York City to life with its location settings. The way the city looks at night. The way the lighting is inside one of the nightclubs that Bree goes into. The movie captures what the early 1970's look like. People back then can go into these clubs and there were interracial relationships inside these place and even outside. That entire look really illustrates what New York City was back in the early 70's, with its portrayal of urban landscape.Going back to Fonda's character, I love the scenes where she goes to her therapist and she talks about her relationship with Klute. Those scenes are skillfully written with realism. People might think that those scenes were thrown in to describe just how desperate Bree is in life. I object that statement. Those scenes are the best parts in this movie. Aside the thriller aspects involving the killer stalking Fonda's character, I was amazed by how open she is toward the audience and it isn't done because it has to be done. It is there to give more about what Fonda's character is all about. That creates more of a slice of life feeling to Bree. It is rare to find that kind of creation in a thriller like this one.With a suspenseful score by Michael Small, Klute is one thriller that will stay with you as long as you admired it for what it is. It is certainly a film where characters are locked up in a world where the coldness of the real world will keep them inside for good. ★★★ 1\/2 3 1\/2 stars.

But this is the first and likely to be the only movie that will ever made that liberalizes that notion. 'Being John Malkovich' is a brilliant, whacky Kafka-esqe comedy of inventive writing. This is the kind of movie where you either hate every second or you smile and let yourself go with it. I am part of the latter. This is the craziest and most original comedy I have ever seen.As the movie opens a street puppeteer named Craig (John Cusack) has just lost his job. His puppets are works of macabre performance art and now he has found himself looking for work because of 'today's wintry job climate'.He goes to work as a file clerk in a building on floor 7½, which has low ceilings that the employees have to stoop down to work under. Any other comedy would have been happy with this joke but Kaufman's script is just getting warmed up.One day Craig discovers a small door behind the file cabinet. He opens it and his whisked away through a portal into the brain of actor John Malkovich. He hears what Malkovich hears, sees what he sees and goes where he goes. Fifteen minutes later he drops out of the sky by the side of the New Jersey turnpike.He informs his co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener) of his journey and after she tries out the portal she hatches a plan. She persuades him to start charging admission so that people can get their fifteen minutes. Eventually John Malkovich himself discovers their little operation and goes to find out what is going on. At one point he enters his own portal and - let's just say that Freud could have written volumes on that experience.Another development Craig's wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) tries out Malkovich's portal while Malkovich is on a date with Maxine. When Lotte and Maxine find out what has happened they begin having a pseudo-lesbian affair that only works when one takes over Malkovich's brain.Now, what I have described of the plot is only about 15%. The movie still has a long way to go. A new development comes along and then another and another and another. Charlie Kaufman has a screenplay here that would have been enough for ten movies. When it was over I realized that as much material as he has in his wonderful script that this movie could have gone on for another hour.The cast contains some of my favorite actors. John Cusack that wonderfully intelligent actor here plays a puppeteer who finds the ultimate puppet show. Catherine Keener is perfection at playing cold, manipulative and nasty women here and in last year's 'Your Friends & Neighbors'. Cameron Diaz is a beautiful actress and gives up something for this film that most actresses never could her vanity. She plays Lotte behind mop of unruly brown hair and no make-up. Her character is sweet but becomes obsessed Maxine and Malkovich.'Being John Malkovich' is the kind of movie that I long for. After all the junk, this is a drink in the oasis in a desert full of mostly 'entertainment' dreck. It must have taken a small miracle for director Spike Jonze to get this kind of content on screen. I have heard some people call it weird confusing nonsense. Mostly those are the people who go in for dead-end garbage like 'The Waterboy'. 'Being John Malkovich' is funny and creative and gives the audience something to talk about afterwards. Those who can appreciate it know its greatness.

Director Philippe Mora had previously made the critically-abhorred second entry and wasn't completely happy with the finished results himself. Since he'd purchased the rights to the Howling brand name from the original author, he decided to take a second stab at making a comic werewolf flick. Though the opening credits claims it's based on Brandner's third book in the series, it in fact has nothing at all to do with the book and is based on an original idea by the director himself. Aside from the abysmal HOWLING NEW MOON RISING (1995), this is the lowest-rated Howling title here on IMDb, which I find utterly perplexing. This is extremely bizarre and sometimes off-putting in its weirdness, but it's also frequently hilarious, often very clever and filled with interesting ideas. Instead of being the 2nd lowest rated film in this series on here, I actually think it deserves to be the 2nd HIGHEST rated.Silent film footage from 1905 depicting Australian natives tying a werewolf to a tree and killing it as well as current reports of werewolf killings in the village of Leovich in Siberia send anthropology professor Dr. Harry Beckmeyer (Barry Otto) - later joined by colleague Professor Sharp (Ralph Cotterill) - on a quest to prove the creatures actually exist. Meanwhile, in the small village of Flow, Jerboa (beautiful Imogen Annesley) is getting fed up dealing with her abusive stepfather Thylo (Max Fairchild) and flees her tribe.

It doesn't always work, but it's a consistently interesting film and one of the most original werewolf films ever conceived. Mora deserves more credit than he has gotten for trying something completely different here. The plot makes room for an odd werewolf birthing scene (it's a cute little thing that lives in the protagonists belly), a posse of hunters sent to eradicate the werewolves with machine guns and bazookas (!) and a Russian werewolf ballerina (Dagmar Bláhová) who flees her homeland to meet up with the Aussie tribe and ends up transforming mid-performance. Hell, even the President of the United States (played by Michael Pate) gets involved at one point!The werewolves themselves are handled completely differently than in any other film of this type. These are not monsters who kill for pleasure or even food, and they are not cursed humans, they are depicted as a misunderstood separate species who resort to violence only when they have to as a means of survival. The film draws a fascinating parallel between the werewolves and the thylacine, which were striped marsupials commonly called Tasmanian Tigers that lived in Australia and Tasmania until the mid-1930s are were driven to extinction by man. Like the werewolves here, the thylacine had patterned stripes along their backs and were misunderstood and feared by humans, who wrongfully blamed them for killing their sheep and livestock when that wasn't actually the case. The few surviving thylacine in zoos were apparently mishandled and poorly treated until they existed no more. The film includes rare film footage of the now-extinct animal taken at a London zoo.The expected lycanthrope mythology is also refreshingly thrown right out of the window. Full moons and silver bullets don't factor in at all and the transformations of man to wolf can be willed by the werewolves or caused by fear, stress or flashing lights. Mora also includes both nods to his previous films (a poster for THE BEAST WITHIN 1982 hangs above a bed) and some amusing references to the first Howling film, including a mock Oscar ceremony with a cameo appearance by Dame Edna (Barry Humphries) directly referencing the the original film's ending.

The ones that are beyond excellent, and those that that are complete garbage. The ones that teeter between not entirely bad, but really all that good become left out like a sore thumb. Brian Gibson's The Juror based on a novel by George Dawes Green falls in the category of forgettable average films even though it stars a cast of very talented performers like Demi Moore, Alec Baldwin, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Anne Heche and James Gandolfini. It's a very easy film to keeping its obscure status because it's overall a mediocre film that leans more towards a bad mediocre than a good one with some rather absurd characters complimented with an even more absurd story that goes way off kilter at times. Demi Moore stars as a sculptor names Annie Laird who's been assigned to stand as a juror on the trial of a hardened Mafia crime boss, only to fell her life and her young son Oliver (Joseph Gordon Levitt)are in jeopardy. A minion of his known only as The Teacher (Alec Baldwin) convinces her to plead Not Guilty. Even after the trail folds, her and her son's life are still in the balance which leads to her taking care of business herself, personally. The intensity level of the story here is really not that bad considering that a juror was forced to overrule a decision by a Mafia minion. The suspense even after the trial with her still being under the threat still sends chills up my spine after viewing it for the first time in many years. It's what you would expect in a bone-chilling suspense thriller. But the script by Ted Tally was badly executed making the story awfully surreal. The characters just don't match nicely to the story-line and charge up the tense dramatic scenes goes way out of proportions to the point where it unintentionally becomes more laughable. Even the opening scenes where Annie has the chance to bow of the trial is very awkwardly built up. I personally would not ever consider stepping up to such a situation knowing that your life and your loved one's lives would be in jeopardy. It just seems odd that Annie seems more determined to through with it makes her at times be kind of a daft individual. Her enthusiasm makes doesn't give much sympathy to her situation as she gladly agrees to the trial and that a mob henchman is breathing down her and Oliver's neck unless she pleads Not Guilty to the judge. And to make matters worse she eventually takes matters in her own hands as she decides to confront the Mafia without realizing what these guys are capable of. The surrealist structuring isn't with just the protagonists, but the antagonists as well. Alec Baldwin's character Marc The Teacher Cordell is meant to be a chilling, cold-blooded remorseless killer, he doesn't come across that cerebral. Granted Baldwin does a good job of making this man a cool and collected individual, but it seems his motives are not fully functioning at times. I'm not condemning Moore or Baldwin in any way; they give a good performances in what's given to them, but the motives between the leading hero and villain just don't hit the right cords. Surely, to have a compelling ending, you have to mold the ending with some rather bizarre twists that are not always plausible. And in the genre of suspenseful thrillers, it should come as no surprise. Sadly, in The Juror, the results are not thrilling, but just plain dumb and quite unconvincing. If it would've had a conclusion similar to the like of Runaway Jury, then this movie would've had a better outcome. If they would have gone with Annie overturning the judge's decision, then I wouldn't be ranting too much on this movie. The supporting cast behind Moore and Baldwin, fail to add any impression on me. Joseph Gordon-Levitt who would later climb to bigger and better things later in his career, was quite good as innocent child put in precarious situation by his naive mother. James Ganolfini who would later on become the iconic Tony Soprano was near perfect as mob henchman Eddie was really not offered much to do and Anne Heche's Juliet is only as a clichéd sex symbol as she gets jazzy with The Teacher. It's like as if it's never been done before. At long last all I can say is that The Juror was an unsatisfying thriller that was let down by the characters and a story structure that loses its direction and tarnishes in what could have potentially been a very exciting thriller. The effort to boost excitement was put-off because they took a wrong turn in direction making this movie contrived and stupid instead of a chilling surprise ending which this film had the potential to achieve.

For me it was a strange proposal, why wouldn't they be able to show something raw, uncensored, original? The answer was obvious, but I am not going to dwell on that point.La Planete Sauvage is probably a movie in this category. The film is short, just over an hour, but from the very beginning it starts with something controversial a woman carrying a baby is being teased by giant humanoids that have fingers the size of the woman. It turns out they are children, playing with the human as a human would play with an ant. They accidentally kill her and her baby is being taken as a pet by one of these giants. They are called Tragg and they consider humans animals, to be petted or exterminated as they please. The very first scenes are brutal to watch and that's why I think this would never sit well with a culture that values superiority more than anything else.You have to watch it in French, if you get the language, I had a dual French\/English audio film with English subtitles and, even if I didn't go through the English audio, there is something about the French language that just naturally blends with the arrogant culture of the Traggs. The Tragg culture and their planet were truly spectacular. To think that in 1973 someone thought of a superior technological culture that is truly alien while remaining humanoid, and did it well, was amazing. The concepts hold true even now, in 2014!I have to say that I have been thinking of writing a story about humans treated as pets by an alien culture, but after I've seen this I couldn't possibly do it, as it is perfect as storyline and concepts. It also makes me think of another subject close to my heart dogs. In Romania there are still a lot of vagabond dogs and the heartless and pointless discussions about exterminating them are very close to what the Tragg are doing when considering the human vermin. There are also some ideas about the wild human society that hit close to this concept of groups of people gathering around the mentality of the lowest common denominator. So, in my mind, to add valid philosophical and moral points to an already brilliant story with fantastic drawings is like covering the icing of the cake with a ton of cherries!About the animation style. This is something that made some people rate this film a lot lower than it deserves. Are you aware that it was made in 1973, by Czech animators? Actually, besides the voice actors and the wonderful director René Laloux, there were almost no French people in the production team. The animation in the Czech Republic is a reason for national pride, but the way they do it was unique and certainly different from the US, French and Japanese animation styles. OK, so maybe you prefer the animation style of Robin Hood, with the animals, but really, this is so much better in so many ways that I couldn't possibly get snagged on animation.Bottom line The imagination, the way it just threw out there idea after idea, no matter how uncomfortable, the storyline, the amazing creatures, the weird ways in which they were killing people... it was true sci-fi. The real thing! Watch this! It will take an hour of your life, big deal! You will see that your brain will churn all of those ideas for a while after watching the film.

Not that this is a bad film per se; it just happens to be just OK in most areas while never really excelling at anything.Dipsa Phi fraternity pledges Keith (Chris Makepeace, from MEATBALLS) and AJ (Robert Rusler, from A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2) talk themselves out of a silly hazing ceremony by agreeing to get anything the frat needs for an upcoming party. That turns out to be a stripper and, since they're living in a small town, strippers require a two hour drive into Los Angeles to acquire. The problem? Neither of them has a car. They're then forced to enlist the aid of the friendless, extremely annoying and pathetic try-hard Duncan Spriggs (Gedde Watanabe) to get them there. Duncan agrees in exchange for a week's worth of their friendship (?!), which may make this 'comic' depiction of an Asian- American even more offensive than Watanabe's turn as Long Duk Dong in SIXTEEN CANDLES. The three guys finally arrive in L.A., have a run in with albino gang leader Snow (Billy Drago) at a diner and finally make it to the After Hours Club in once piece. After viewing a truly strange performance art strip act by exotic club owner \/ star attraction Katrina (Grace Jones), AJ gets permission to go to her dressing room to discuss employing her for the frat party. He doesn't return. Keith eventually realizes that nearly the entire strip club, including the emcee (Sandy Baron), the bouncer (Brad Logan) and most of the dancers are actually vampires. They usually prey on vagrants, bums and other people no one will miss, but this time they've made a mistake with AJ and now must cover their tracks by eliminating all evidence he was there.

Sure, she's not for everyone, but in my opinion she is the only truly memorable aspect of this entire movie. The former model turned singer and actress doesn't utter a single word in the film but manages to be both intimidating and creepy thanks to her offbeat demeanor, ultra-bizarre Egyptian-themed wardrobe choice and androgynous facial structure, which is made even more striking thanks to blue contact lenses, white face paint and a bright red wig. There's a good reason it was her image and her image alone that has been used to market the film over the years and if anything this film suffers most because she's underutilized and not on screen nearly as much as she should have been. Aside from the presence of Jones, the makeup effects from Greg Cannom are good and the production values in general are adequate down the board. It's also VERY 80s and the whole film is shot through with a hideous neon pink and green lighting scheme. What is most surprising of all is just how restrained, unexciting and glib the whole thing is considering the premise involves vampires working out of a strip club.

It failed to come close to matching the commercial and critical success of FRIGHT NIGHT (1985) or THE LOST BOYS (1987), wasn't stylish enough to rope in the artsy-fartsy crowd like THE HUNGER (1983), wasn't inventive and atmospheric enough to gain a cult following similar to that of NEAR DARK (1987) and couldn't even retrospectively be viewed through the rose-colored nostalgia glasses like THE MONSTER SQUAD (1987) because it's not quite charming enough. Not that this is a bad film per se; it just happens to be just OK in most areas while never really excelling at anything.Dipsa Phi fraternity pledges Keith (Chris Makepeace, from MEATBALLS) and AJ (Robert Rusler, from A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2) talk themselves out of a silly hazing ceremony by agreeing to get anything the frat needs for an upcoming party. That turns out to be a stripper and, since they're living in a small town, strippers require a two hour drive into Los Angeles to acquire. The problem? Neither of them has a car. They're then forced to enlist the aid of the friendless, extremely annoying and pathetic try-hard Duncan Spriggs (Gedde Watanabe) to get them there. Duncan agrees in exchange for a week's worth of their friendship (?!), which may make this 'comic' depiction of an Asian- American even more offensive than Watanabe's turn as Long Duk Dong in SIXTEEN CANDLES. The three guys finally arrive in L.A., have a run in with albino gang leader Snow (Billy Drago) at a diner and finally make it to the After Hours Club in once piece. After viewing a truly strange performance art strip act by exotic club owner \/ star attraction Katrina (Grace Jones), AJ gets permission to go to her dressing room to discuss employing her for the frat party. He doesn't return. Keith eventually realizes that nearly the entire strip club, including the emcee (Sandy Baron), the bouncer (Brad Logan) and most of the dancers are actually vampires. They usually prey on vagrants, bums and other people no one will miss, but this time they've made a mistake with AJ and now must cover their tracks by eliminating all evidence he was there. Since Keith himself is part of that evidence, he teams up with an excessively perky non-vampire waitress \/ dancer (Dedee Pfeiffer) and basically just tries to survive the wacky night.I've seen numerous people question Grace Jones' sex appeal as the sultry queen bee vampire who runs things. Sure, she's not for everyone, but in my opinion she is the only truly memorable aspect of this entire movie. The former model turned singer and actress doesn't utter a single word in the film but manages to be both intimidating and creepy thanks to her offbeat demeanor, ultra-bizarre Egyptian-themed wardrobe choice and androgynous facial structure, which is made even more striking thanks to blue contact lenses, white face paint and a bright red wig. There's a good reason it was her image and her image alone that has been used to market the film over the years and if anything this film suffers most because she's underutilized and not on screen nearly as much as she should have been. Aside from the presence of Jones, the makeup effects from Greg Cannom are good and the production values in general are adequate down the board. It's also VERY 80s and the whole film is shot through with a hideous neon pink and green lighting scheme. What is most surprising of all is just how restrained, unexciting and glib the whole thing is considering the premise involves vampires working out of a strip club. In other words, this would have been much better had it been a little more freewheeling and uninhibited than it is. This same idea would be done much better later on in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN (1996).

Considering 90s cinematography technologies, James Cameron did an outstanding job. Every detail of this cult movie, from the plot to the music was awesome. In the first movie, the terminator was the bad guy. With a tremendous body like Greek gods and his robot-like accent, Arnold Schwarzenegger was a perfect fit to the Terminator character. He was sent back from future to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the mother of an unborn child who will become the leader of a resistance against the machines. We all know the story. But in T2, he came back to protect the son of Sarah Connor which I believe was a very good twist. Arnold did his part very well again as the cyborg of our dreams. What surprised me was the transformation of Linda Hamilton's character. I honestly didn't see that coming. Sarah Connor was a vulnerable young girl in the first movie. But she turned into a bad-ass woman who has lots and lots of guns. I was really impressed. I have watched this movie so many times over the years and it never gets old or boring. Just watch it.

Spies and counter spies, no one can be trusted, defections to the East German sector, Julie Andrews in a quandary,Paul Newman burdened with secrets etc. It is all intriguing, and the death of the policeman is one of he most graphic death scenes for Hitchcock, although Psycho's offering is one in a billion.Andrews and Newman..what a couple! But they are so bland, and often act against each other. What's going on? Newman is more experienced and so he washes Julie Andrews off the screen. Yes, he might be doing that. However, her static nature, her talk, her ordering food in restaurants (and there are many sit-down scenes in this) in this film makes for more tension as we move along, and as it turns out. Hitchcock always knows what to do with not-so-hot actors..he turns it all around on you and them, in this case Miss Andrews.There are notable scenes,in the theater for example, and a lot of strange rear projection shots and whole studio-origin scenes that become more obvious, especially in this lurid color film. What's going on? Hitchcock hated locations, but this had a big budget..he wants, I think, to make a film that is somewhat false, scenic, derivative even..in plot structural terms,an overestimation of Communism and its threat to our materialistic world. Look at Julie Andrew's hair and clothes..very expensive, very much like Marnie. It has an anti McCarthyism mood about it, a comic book flavor to it that justifies many otherwise awkward technical moments. Hitchcock loved playing games, and he loved comic book inventiveness..this film could be a MARVEL piece, and I think it is one. Hitchcock triumphs again. During the making of this, he told people that he was sad about it all, did not like Newman too much or Andrews, hated the color photography etc etc..all of this gossip to throw critics and viewers as well way off the track. And the soundtrack!!! Isn't it lush for this kind of drama?See this film at 132 minutes, very long, and watch the antic disposition of a master at work. It is a very underrated film.

From this point on, van occupants' luck goes from bad to worse. The first-half plot, during daytime, trends somewhat dull, though some scenes foreshadow what is to come in the second half.As dusk settles in, the horror action heats up, peaking in the dead of night. Indeed, the scariest scenes are those that take place outdoors in the dark. One sequence in particular is frightening; two characters trudge through thick brush with just a flashlight. Suddenly upon them is the face of a maniacal man with a buzzing chainsaw. The lighting on the man's face, and the suddenness with which he attacks, creates a bogeyman straight out of a child's nightmare.But what is the point of the movie? Apparently there is none, apart from provoking sheer fright. Those sequences that are most disturbing could be condensed into about twenty to thirty minutes.

Seagal plays a Chicago cop who was recruited by the CIA in 1969 in Japan. In 1973, he was sent to Vietnam and while there, he witnesses a brutal torture of a Cambodian resident under the spell of a vicious man, (Henry Silva). Seagal's friend advises him to leave Vietnam and go home. 15 years later, Seagal is a Chicago policeman, working with a partner, (Pam Grier), who is retiring in a couple of months. When he learns that a major shipment is going down in Chicago, Seagal's character, Nico Toscani, finds out a cache of explosives. Things get worse after that. Toscani father's church is blown up and it's up to him to find out who is responsible for the bombing. This leads Seagal through a change of pace as he breaks the rule and risks his entire police career by trying to rights the wrongs.Seagal does an impressive job of playing an main character who is believable. In some scenes, he knows how to act calm and play it straight. When it comes tot he action scenes, Seagal knows how to show off his martial arts skills. Most action actors tend to lost their character by putting too much emphasis on their skills. But not Seagal. He may be different than Charles Bronson or Clint Eastwood, but you got to give him credit for what does best. It's a shame that he wouldn't repeat the same thing twice because after he starred in Above the Law, Seagal starred in another film called Hard to Kill and Under Siege. His career then started to take a turn for the worse when he decided to drop out of Hollywood and starred in a number of bad action movies. Those ween't really worthy of his career, but Above the Law certainly shows what Seagal is meant on the big screen.The supporting cast is also very good. Pam Grier, who was also a major star in the 1970's is very good and sort of surprising to see her starred along aside Seagal. Grier is very convincing as Seagal's partner. She is noticing just how his behavior is getting in the way of his police appearance. The movie was directed by Andrew Davis, who also directed Code of Silence, which is, perhaps, the best Chuck Norris movie ever made. Davis certainly knows how to make a city story interesting. He photographed Chicago very clearly and very skillfully. When it comes the action scenes in this movie, Davis knows how to step back and let Seagal perform his fighting skills, which is pretty impressive. After he made Above the Law, Andrew Davis directed Seagal again in the 1992 action thriller, Under Siege. According to my perspective, I believe that with the teaming of Seagal and Davis being strong, I think that with the tools they have to make a decent action picture, they certainly do know how to make them exciting, not nauseating. It's rare to find a bonding between actor and director, especially in the action genre. Most action directors now don't really work together to make scenes seem exciting.With the exception of Seagal's performance, Above the Law has a plot that is sort of complicated if you follow everything very carefully. But as an action movie, it is effective even when Seagal is on the big screen. This movie proves that he can act in character and even, if I dare to say so, out of character. He is that good. ★★★ 3 stars. ","genre":null},{"date":"31 August 2014","score":"","review":" When it comes to action stars, they are at first, calm and collected in some scenes in an action movie.
