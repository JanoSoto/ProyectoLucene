This movie takes you through the drug addictions of 4 characters and how it would affect their lives, and how as soon as you get to the addiction stage of these drugs then you will do whatever you can to keep them up.

The movie tells an hour and a half story about a marketing executive, who is trying to get home to his family in Chicago as he was having a business trip in New York. Also, he comes across a traveling salesman that sales shower curtain rings as our two main characters are having a hard time to get along as they try to get to Chicago. It feels a bit strange on why many movies focus more on other types of holiday themes like Halloween and Christmas. I felt that there should be more moves that takes place during Thanksgiving, but try not to copy the same formula as what this movie did. Just make it as your own thing as it is done right. Planes, Trains and Automobiles will be still always be the greatest Thanksgiving movie of all time as it features a great story with great characters as well as the movie mixes its balance of humor and heart. John Hughes is such a great director for making great movies like Ferris Bueller's Day Off; Sixteen Candles; and The Breakfast Club. I also do enjoy Uncle Buck as well as the first two Home Alone movies, which he didn't direct those; but anyway, I thought he does a remarkable job on writing, producing, and directing the movie as he works well by telling a story and working with actors. Steve Martin and John Candy are both the heart and soul of the movie, and they always have a wonderful chemistry with each other. The movie is also funny, but it works so well on its levels for giving these characters some personalities. They do act like real people, which makes them colorful. I wish I can go on more about this movie, but you already know what is so great about this movie and I do agree on how great it is. The movie is indeed rated R, but the reason it receive that because of this one scene in the movie where Steve Martin's character starts loosing it as he drops some F-bombs in front of a rental agent that he is begging for a car, and expressing himself on how miserable he is. When you watch this movie, you feel like that you are actually with these guys as you are on a journey. What makes this movie very special is our main characters, which again, they are the heart and soul of the movie. I love this movie, and you will have a lot of fun by watching it. I give Planes, Trains and Automobiles a 10 out of 10, and I wish you a Happy Thanksgiving!

I first saw it in a theater when it was originally released during the big Chris Rock craze that was going on at the time. I was a big fan of his comedy and liked him a lot.I was very disappointed by this movie and wanted to walk out several times. It's bad for many reasons but, the main one is that it's just not funny. This movie is supposed to be a comedy but, there are very few jokes, even in the scenes that contain stand-up. The makers of the movie also missed a lot of opportunities to add funny scenes. Throughout the majority of the film, Chris Rock's character is dead and his soul is inside the body of an older, white guy. Throughout these scenes, we see Chris Rock, and not the white guy which is fine but, we should see the white guy a lot more, especially since that's how everyone else sees him. We only see the way he looks physically a few times and only for a couple seconds each time. There is one scene where the main character is listening to a rap song and starts singing along to it. We see the white guy for a second and it's funny since you wouldn't expect to see someone like that singing along to rap, right? But, we see him so quickly that, the joke isn't even given a chance to exist. The makers of the movie seem way too concerned with having Chris Rock on screen as much as possible.Then there's the ending. I don't want to give away too many details for those who haven't watched the movie but, it's one of the weirdest and flat-out disturbing endings to a movie that I've ever seen.

First we never properly got introduced to the hero of the movie, yes we knew it should have been Babe (Dustin Huffman) from the list of actors not from the movie. We do not know who Babe's brother and his colleague were really working for. After death of Babe's brother, Janeway made his way into his apartment like he was a man of authority or something. Later on we see he is one of the bad guys. Again we get doubts as he shoot them, and again he becomes a bad guy by trying to kill Babe. This sort of upside down in character is worthy of a 2 bit TV show where they have to do these things to make the show going. Another big hole in the plot was Elsa. The way Elsa and Babe met in library and Babe steal her book to get to her lately, that could not be a plot and even if it was, no one could predict the outcome. The way they met suggests that the writer (William Goldman) did not know the end of the story when he wrote the novel and play. Well, that's how most stories and novels are written but when you get to a point that you have to put a character in another use than that originally intended, you go back and cover the trace. So I would say William Goldman was either stupid or lazy. The way their relationship started could not end up with Elsa being Szell's agent, no way.

Long story short, the story was so bad that I can not think of any fix. One had to write the story from the very beginning to make things right.

Well, that's how most stories and novels are written but when you get to a point that you have to put a character in another use than that originally intended, you go back and cover the trace.

But now that he's assumed the role of the agent, he's enlisted to become the agent he was trying to prove he was not. It will make your head explode!Cary Grant is phenomenal in the role, making quick comebacks and speaking rapidly; you would believe that someone with his personality would get in such a mess. It feels like a precursor to a James Bond movie or an Indiana Jones movie in my opinion a suspenseful thriller that works as a comedy all rolled into one.The screenplay, written by Ernest Lehman, keeps the viewer guessing but also provides answers in a timely fashion. For example, when things start going wrong for the protagonist near the beginning, we aren't forced to wait until the closing scenes to uncover the plot against him. Enough clues are provided early that the intelligent viewer can deduce what's going on and move to the next mystery. Such intellectual participation, always a Hitchcock hallmark, is sadly lacking in most of today's so-called thrillers.As is the case with many of Hitchcock's films, the director sets up his hero as the only one who knows the truth. His story is so preposterous that no one else believes him without a great deal of convincing. We, of course, sympathize with the hero immediately, because we know that he's sane and is the victim of a conspiracy - even though we don't understand what that conspiracy entails.Of course, the hallmark of North by Northwest is the way in which Hitchcock develops tension. It only takes one introductory scene - the one with Thornhill and his secretary in a cab - for us to lend our sympathy to the hero. From that point, with a lone exception, we see things through his eyes.

The film won 6 Academy awards in 1995, including Best Picture, Best Director (Robert Zemeckis, Back to the Future-trilogy, Cast Away again with Hanks later on) and Best Actor (2nd win in a row for Hanks after Philadelphia). And even if it lost Best Score to The Lion King, the music, especially the main theme, is nothing short of brilliant. It starts right away as we watch a feather fly towards the film's central character. Visually and acoustically a feast from minute one.Forrest sits on a bench waiting for the bus and tells the other people who are waiting his story. Thank God he did not know that he could just walk to Jenny, otherwise we may have never found out about his stories. And as diverse as Forrest's life is, as diverse are also the reactions from those people. Some sit quietly, others accuse him of being a liar and the old lady finally is captivated by his story. The interesting thing is that Gump gets out the photo as evidence not before the man (who accuses him of lying) leaves. He could have proved it easily, but he has nothing to prove to anybody. This is the frame of the story. The real action takes place in the stories Gump tells. Some true emotional highlights are included Bubba's death and the funeral eulogy to Jenny (great HI. reference by the way) at the end. Of course, all the moments with his son (played by the very young Haley Joel Osment) are very much worth watching too. And then there is Gary Sinise who was pretty much on par with Hanks during their comedic and dramatic moments together. He did not won the Oscar, but was at least as deserving as Landau and Jackson. With his character, early on, you could never say if he would develop into a friend to Gump or stay\/become a big antagonist. Finally, it turned out to be the former. When they have prostitutes one night at their place, it becomes truly clear for the very first time. Gump serves as a great role model to Sinise's character for all he achieved despite his limitations.This is not the greatest movie ever made, but there is a certain charm to it that makes it so unique in movie history, possibly because the central character is at least as unique. And finally, there is the Forrest-Jenny love story which is sweet from start to finish and one of the main reasons why this film will make you laugh, will make you cry and will make you feel for Forrest for its almost 2.5-hour . And even in the almost impossible case that you will not remain interested in Forrest's story, this film is very much worth watching alone for all the references to past decades (most of all in terms of the movements in society, the music and politics).

In fact, the first five minutes is great, even if it does not seem to have much to do with the rest of the movie. Regarding the rest of the movie, Bond is assigned to investigate Auric Goldfinger. He is a jeweler who buys gold legally, and then ships it to Hong Kong where he sells it on the black market for three times the price he paid for it. This is the great crime that requires the attention of England's best secret agent?Later, Bond finds out about Operation Grand Slam, Goldfinger's plan to nuke Fort Knox, destroying the gold, and causing his own horde of the metal to skyrocket in value. Quite by accident, then, Bond's being assigned to investigate Goldfinger turns out to be appropriate, even if serendipitously so.Q gives Bond the famous Aston Martin with the machine guns, ejector seat, and much more, but even so, he eventually is captured by Goldfinger. The laser that almost cuts Bond in half also cuts the movie in half, the first part making it half of the greatest Bond movie ever made. Then comes the second half of the movie, the point at which it starts being silly, when Bond wakes up on the plane and a woman introduces herself as Pussy Galore. In fact, this is the point at which the whole Bond franchise starts being silly, with subsequent Bond movies becoming bloated with girls, gadgets, and wisecracks, on the principle that if some is good, then more is better.As far as this movie is concerned, one item of silliness is the way Goldfinger goes on a pointless killing spree. He assembles representatives of organized crime from all over the world, each with a million dollars, which we think he needs to finance Operation Grand Slam. But it turns out that the whole thing is already set up and ready to go, so he does not need their money. Nevertheless, he kills them all and steals their money, because the fortune he is about to make in gold is just not enough for him. Never mind that he will soon be pursued by governments all over the world when he destroys Fort Knox with a nuclear device. Now he will have the Mafia and other crime organizations looking for him too. Considering that Goldfinger was already a rich man to begin with, we have to wonder what all this will accomplish, besides making him the most relentlessly hunted man in the world. Even if Operation Grand Slam were to succeed, he would never be able to enjoy his augmented wealth, nor even the life of luxury and freedom that he already had. All this can be safely ignored, of course, because we know that Bond is going to kill him anyway, which he does, sparing Goldfinger the fate of having to spend the rest of his life hiding in a hole in the ground.

Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Spacey all play very fitting characters for each of their acting styles. Brad Pitt plays a rookie police detective new to a crime written city who's personality is very cavalier and inpatient. Where on the other hand Morgan Freemen plays a veteran detective that has worked in the city for years and whom is rational.

After Brad Pit's character realizes this he is overwhelmed with emotion has an ultimatum to face, either kill the murderer and be committed of the last deadly sin which is wrath and jeopardize his life and career or let the murderer live and be dealt with thorough the Justice system.

It neither said anything of any significance, nor did it succeed in clearing up any ambiguity left over from its prequel, 2001.... In fact, I'd say that this picture only served to confuse the original story that much more.And, finally - Can someone please tell me what's so great about having 2 suns? Eh?... This phenomenon certainly couldn't be of any benefit to man. If you ask me, I'd say that having 2 suns would very likely mess up the balance of nature on this planet like it's never been messed up before.Anyways - 2 enthusiastic thumbs down for 2010, a real piece of Sci-Fi\/Thriller junk from 1984.

(Like, give me a break, already!)All-in-all - I'd sure like to know why they even bothered to tell this sequel's tale. It neither said anything of any significance, nor did it succeed in clearing up any ambiguity left over from its prequel, 2001.... In fact, I'd say that this picture only served to confuse the original story that much more.And, finally - Can someone please tell me what's so great about having 2 suns? Eh?...

Because of the huge difference between Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan. Well after watching it I realized that the two are perfect together. One is a serious cop who's only goal is to solve crimes that has been committed. While the other one is a cool, slick cop who likes women and having a good time. This is a movie I always have fun watching. Jackie Chan does the fighting, Chris Tucker does the talking. Chris Tucker was just hysterical and Jackie Chan was brilliant with his incredible stunts. If you want to see a brilliant action comedy, I recommend you get Rush Hour.
