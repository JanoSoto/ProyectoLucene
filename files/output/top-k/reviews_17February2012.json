(You know what? That bit still makes me laugh.) Arnie plays John Kruger, a guy who doesn't officially exist, whose specialty is making it look like people in need of protection don't exist to keep them safe from various nefarious high-ups and\/or low lives.

This time however the case is a young employee who is a key witness against a Big (evil) Corporation that is illegally making the naughty bing-bing-bing weapons.Eraser actually sports a fairly string cast of mainly James'; Coburn, Caan and Cromwell all get turns at being bad guys or Arnie's superiors&#x85; or both.

And I must say almost 20 years later they are some impressive fake dinosaurs.When an eccentric wealthy Brit named John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) and his team of scientific gurus devise a way to genetically recreate any and all species of dinosaurs his first thought is to turn the whole thing into a theme park for the kiddies. Call me cynical but I would've thought that a very American thing to do.But first for insurance purposes Hammond must get some real dinosaur experts in to assess whether the park poses a real threat to paying punters or not&#x85; Ummm, let me cut you off there; dinosaurs + people = threat. Movie over right? Thankfully no.Enter Dr Allen Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), a couple of palaeontologists (dino-docs) that think painstakingly brushing away at the dirt to find tiny scraps of million year old bone is loads of fun &#x96; they're in for a shock. Also in tow is a lawyer overseeing proceedings and a 'professor of chaos' Dr Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) who is not a WWE wrestler even though the job title practically demands this should be the case but a mathematician who has the proverbial 'very bad feeling about this'. To spice things up Hammond has invited his two young grandchildren along for the ride, sort of like bringing the teenage model daughter to an R. Kelly, Michael Jackson show.They explain how it all happens in preposterously possible jargon but who cares? I mean BRING ON THE OLD GIANT LIZARDS! So off the three docs, lawyer and two kids head off in automatically piloted jeeps on a preset course through the park for a private viewing of the as yet unopened park.Of course things don't go smoothly for the maiden tour, our reluctant heroes spend much of the time screaming and running around covered in mud and followed closely by sharp toothed ferocious computer generated beasties.Even though the movie is quite PG and reasonably safe for most kids in the double digits there are of course casualties, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that the first two munched on are a lawyer and an annoying bit character from Seinfeld.Spielberg sensibly holds off with his coup de grace the T Rex but when he does unleash the big guy he makes sure that it is the centrepiece of the film and by far the best sequence. It has been often parodied since but the menacing ripples in the cups of water are quite foreboding, and the money shot of the big eye still works.The second half of the finale made such a star of the velociraptor that it not only is now probably the #2 best know dinosaur behind Rex but even managed to become the mascot of a NBA team &#x96; not that they are very good&#x85; As alluded to previously the visual effects were absolutely astonishing near 20 years ago and they still hold up to close scrutiny today. It's only a pity they didn't think to take some pixels to Laura Dern, who it needs to be said has a face like a shoe (with apologies to Ben Harper).As the character of John Hammond likes to say &#x96; frequently &#x96; he 'spared no expense' in making Jurassic Park. The same can be said of Steven Spielberg who really went to town with his new toy CGI, but while Jurassic Park might have been undeniably groundbreaking cinema, as a film it is only very good; not great.Final Rating &#x96; 8 \/ 10. Spawned a couple of increasingly 'samey' sequels, but as is usually the case the original is still the best.

And I must say almost 20 years later they are some impressive fake dinosaurs.When an eccentric wealthy Brit named John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) and his team of scientific gurus devise a way to genetically recreate any and all species of dinosaurs his first thought is to turn the whole thing into a theme park for the kiddies.

Even if you are the least bit spiritual, you will connect to the themes.I was surprised to see some harsh reviews, but I can see why some people might find this movie silly. It's not realistic, it's meant to be surreal. Some of the scenery comes across as cheesy at times, but it is still beautiful. It's art.

Why exactly? Well I'll get to that.The plot takes place years before the original Star Wars and follows a young Obi Wan Kenobi(Ewan McGregor) and his Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn(Liam Neeson). They are sent to the planet of Naboo to negotiate peace terms between Naboo and the Trade Federation. The Federation does not want peace and conquers the planet holding the Queen at hostage. The two land on the planet and meet a Gungan native named Jar Jar Binks. He leads them to the capital city where they rescue the Queen and several others and retreat to another planet.They stop on the planet of Tatooine to find another fuel source and meet a young Anakin Skywalker(Jake Lloyd). Qui-Gon senses the force is strong with him and takes him with them to Coruscant to have trained to become a Jedi.But a new threat is rising and the shadow of the Sith is returning to the galaxy. The mysterious Darth Maul is sent to assassinate the Jedi and the Trade Federation is not going to give up Naboo anytime soon. The battle to start it all is about to begin.The plot sounds like a Star Wars movie but there's something about Phantom Menace that seems off to me. For one thing, most of the actors are all pretty good for their own right. But either a bad script or bad direction makes most of the dialog feel unnatural. Sure Star Wars has never been one for normal conversation between characters but the older movies seemed to do it more casually. And here's the big thing that most people thought was wrong about this movie. The comic relief. No I don't mean C3PO or R2D2 they're as good as ever, I mean Jar Jar Binks. His character is the definition of pandering to the kids. He doesn't do much of anything except lead them to his home and then just sticks around for the rest of the movie not doing anything but looking like an idiot. His character could've been handled a lot better.And another big factor is the performance of Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker. He's too normal. He has a happy life, a good relationship with his mother and all around likes everything. So how is there supposed to be darkness in his heart or whatever? He's the chosen one sure but you're not gonna expect us to think the whole Darth Vader thing just came out of nowhere are you? On top of that the way he delivers his lines are just wrong. He seems to just have one personality. Obnoxiousness. It's really off-putting.Another nitpick is Yoda. He's supposed to be younger here but he looks a thousand years older. Whoever designed the puppet for this movie really didn't do their homework. Frank Oz is still great but I'm wondering why he looked so off.But still the movie does deliver on its action scenes. While the first battle with Darth Maul and the space battle feel rushed and not as epic as they could've been, the fight with Maul near the end of the film is spectacular. And the Pod-Race at the middle is pretty intense too. So yeah this movie isn't my favorite of the Saga but I don't think it's horrible. Maybe the hype was too much. Maybe the film just couldn't live up to the expectations. Maybe it wasn't entirely Jake Lloyd's fault that Anakin was so annoying and more bad direction or script. Any way you look at it the film just doesn't really deliver(at least for me).But even though this movie is my least favorite, I can always watch it whenever I have a Star Wars marathon.

I wouldn't have dared count just how many he takes out in the space of thirty minutes or so but it is at last triple digits.This time around Stallone educates the same boys who thought hiding under sticks was cool about treating a gunshot wound &#x96; the first boys who told us that it was called 'cauterising' the wound in my town were looked upon as Gods. Whatever it is actually called and whether it is realistic or not is irrelevant. It looked cool and painful at once.Again there was a certain repetitiveness to the proceedings after being drawn in against his well things get personal between Rambo and the lead bad guy, for the third film in a row he manages to find a radio with a direct line to his attacker which enables him to pass on his monosyllabic threats before carrying them out a few moments later. The battle scenes with Rambo and Trautman are destructive to say the least, with running from explosions a theme and some inane battle chatter between the pair perhaps the oddest in a series of films not renowned for its dialogue.Apparently at the time of release Rambo 3 was the most expensive film ever made, I can only imagine that the bulk of the budget went in explosions and steroids. But the end result is typically serviceable, and the box-office return of nearly 200 M would've covered some of the costs.Final Rating &#x96; 6.5 \/ 10. Totally unnecessary and practically the same film as its predecessor. But for what it is it works well.If you liked Rambo 2 you'll like this.

As they approach in the pitch black darkness and driving rain they can see several 'free range' patients roaming about in their whites.After pausing to ponder if this is usual practise Myers commandeers the vehicle and drives off.

In short Myers dons a boiler coat and the admittedly eerie melted-Shatner mask and spends what seems like eternity lurking in the edge of every scene. He's practically everywhere! Standing. Watching.

Michael himself takes a licking but keeps right on ticking, something that he only got better at the further the unnecessary sequels went.Halloween is rightfully renowned and still pretty effective &#x96; if not very scary &#x96; in the present day.

Naturally, much greatness was expected from the motion picture adaptation of Masters of the Universe. Oh, what grandness would await us! Lundgren seemed perfect for the role of the kid-friendly, blond version of Conan the Barbarian. This film would be bigger than Star Wars and Lord of the Rings (had we known about this one back then) combined! Just think of the myriads of creatures from the toy-line, Trap-Jaw, Battle-Cat and all the others.Well, there was no Battle-Cat. No Trap-Jaw. No Man-E-Faces, no Mer-Man&#x85; you get my point. Instead, we got a couple of new creatures; we got annoying teenagers that could only exist in 1980's Americana and, of course, Charlie, the most pointless character in the annals of cinema.

Is a Sith a Jedi just in black and emo?

'Bent' is a textbook example for such. I saw the movie as an unconventional love story, set in Germany during the Holocaust era.Max (Owen Wilson) is a homosexual man living in Berlin with his dancer lover Rudy (Brian Webber), and indulging himself into an affair with a Nazi officer. Soon the Nazis track down this officer and slit his throat as a punishment. Shocked, Max and Rudy flee their flat and live in the woods, light years away from their previous lifestyle. However, they are found by Nazis and are transported to the Dachau concentration camp. The train ride is where the prisoners' spirits are first broken, as Max is forced to kill Rudy and have sex with a young girl in order to get the yellow star (signifying he's a Jew) instead of the pink triangle (which is for homosexuals). What originally motivates him is the sound advice of a more experienced gay captive, Horst (Lothaire Bluteau), who makes it clear to him that everyone is on his own and that there is no lower rank among the prisoners than having to wear the pink triangle. In a haunting sentence, Horst says If you want to stay alive, you cannot exist. Once in Dachau, Horst and Max slowly but gradually fall in love despite the inhumane conditions and hardships they have to endure.Director Sean Mathias made sure the train ride is seen as long and frightening trip to hell by portraying it as a machine of terror, aptly using black-and-white imagery and sound effects. He also did a wonderful job at capturing the desolate condition of Dachau by focusing on the iron gates buzzing with electricity. Though war is not explicitly dealt with, the scenarios were carefully selected to reflect the deprived sense of chaos, desperation, hunger and hopelessness. The background music, entirely played by classical instruments, also added to this effect and fit the purpose perfectly.Especially in the first half an hour the characters seem to be overly (melo)dramatic. The gay nightlife seems to be a glittering mess of orgies, with strange but artsy men and women (though mainly men) exchanging bodily fluids as it would be the sole purpose of their existence. I had a bit of a problem with that, because to me those scenes showed no real purpose. They brought out the fact that there were homosexuals also among the Nazis, and it also served as a great contrast to the Dachau environment, but I would have loved it if the story would have allowed a glimpse into another aspect of Max's life aside from sex and parties. However, in a play this underground eroticism must have had a different and perhaps stronger effect than on screen. I simply was looking for something more to Max in the first third of the movie.However, Clive Owen was so amazing that even this is forgivable. I watched him open-mouthed as he delivered the one-hundred-percent credible character of Max to the audience. It seems to me that he was born to bring to life the strong, direct, and at times shocking dialogue that was evident throughout the movie (another example for this would be his role in 'Closer'). I think if I were to read the script, I could not imagine anyone else as Max's voice but Clive Owen. He was a perfect choice.I must also point out and praise the brief yet powerful appearances of several other great artists and actors, such as Mick Jagger as the transvestite Greta, Ian McKellen as Uncle Freddie, Jude Law as the storm trooper, his former wife Sadie Frost as Max's friend, and Rachel Weisz as a prostitute.The viewer only begins to understand Horst well into the movie, when him and Max are assigned for the senseless act of piling stones (and later on snow) from one place to the other. At first he is very rejecting, but then he proves to be a very sensitive person, crushed by the weight of human cruelty. His love and longing for Max is very honest and direct, and despite the unspeakable circumstances, there was something romantic about their growing affection for one another. I absolutely loved the scene when they first 'make love' without touching, without even looking at each other, simply by using words and their imagination to reach out. There was something deeply sad about it, and yet it also managed to show just how ridiculous and meaningless the entire concept of the Holocaust was.It seemed to me that Max undergoes a tremendous change by the end of the movie. He goes from being an irresponsible pretty 'fluff' to a caring, strong man who realizes it is more important to be what he is (or symbolically wear the pink triangle) than it is to be alive without existing. His character shows the audience that surviving without being able to exist is just as meaningless as piling stones from one heap to the other.As I mentioned in the beginning, this movie is not pleasant to watch. Though at times it was disturbing, this movie opened my eyes to the wide range of victims the Nazi regime tortured and killed. It puts the focus on homosexual Holocaust victims, and I find that a very rare thing. What made it so heartbreaking was that I know that Max's story does not fall far from the horrid truth WWII presented to millions.

By right brain I mean that the film is basically one that relies totally on visuals rather than on left brained, logical dialog scenes.This is one film in which you really need to use your intuition in order to appreciate what is happening from moment to moment. You need to do away with the need for dialog scenes, and let the film's visuals just wash all over you until you become immersed in their utter brilliance of execution.You have to let the film happen to you, and, if you do, then it becomes as it was originally advertised to be the ultimate trip! This all seems so hard to believe now, because since then, this film has become one of my all time Top Ten Films, and I named it Best Film of 1968 (the year it was made) because, if you look at most of the films made that year, 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY stands head and shoulders above them all.The film starts with a section called, THE DAWN OF MANKIND, and shows a group of apes before, and then after, they make contact with a mysterious black monolith that makes its appearance near a watering hole they congregate near. This monolith makes a few more startling appearances as the film progresses.After contact with this imposing monolith, the apes seem to gain intelligence, and one of them takes the giant leap into being able to take one of the bones of a dead animal, and then use it as weapon to kill another animal! That's some leap in intelligence, isn't it??!! So, immediately we can sense that this monolith is not all wonderful and it has its bad side.Then, without too much warning, we are thrust immediately into the year 2001, and we see a gigantic space station rotating around the earth. On the soundtrack we can hear the opening strains of Johann Strauss' beautiful piece of music, THE BLUE DANUBE.Thus begins one of the most amazing sequences ever put on film the giant space station rotates ever so gracefully, and the special effects are totally believable as we truly feel we are in outer space, looking down at our beautiful planet Earth. Geoffrey Unsworth's excellent cinematography, the special effects and the Strauss background music score all combine to make the first great impression on our right brain I mentioned earlier.For me, I find it almost impossible not to enjoy this particular sequence of the film because I love the use of special effects in films, and these are definitely special effects that genuinely enhance the film's sense of place. In other words where we are at the moment. In this instance we're in outer space, gliding in tandem with the gigantic space station.Because of the magic this scene generates, we do not need left brained dialog for this sequence. In fact, dialog, and even a few sound effects, would have ruined it and it would have been too jarring and disruptive. The soundtrack music puts us in the correct mood immediately because it is so relaxing, and yet, so upbeat at the same time. Or is the director, Stanley Kubrick, giving the audience a sense of false security? Because we feel so comfortable with this wonderful music playing on the soundtrack, we do not think that there is any need for us to be alarmed, which in fact we need to be later on in the film when the all-controlling HAL-9000 computer reveals its true nature.From this point onwards, the film starts to gather some much needed momentum, and we soon discover that one of those monoliths has been found on the Moon. And it seems that someone (or some thing?) from outer space is sending the Earth messages in the form of these black monoliths, but Earthlings are not apparently smart enough to comprehend these messages as yet!! A new section begins gently and we are then thrust peacefully into another section, set some time much later VOYAGE TO JUPITER. From here on we are part of the mini-drama that evolves between the two astronauts, Dave Bowman and Frank Poole, when the HAL-9000 computer gets a bit too sneaky and starts to sabotage this all important journey because it is too important for possible human error. Maybe HAL's the one who has been organizing the placement of the black monoliths on Earth and in space.It's a thought, and at least this film makes you think.All of Stanley Kubrick's films have, in one way or another, divided his fans and his critics people seemed to either love these films or hate them. So, in that way, Kubrick was always a complete master of keeping the public guessing, and thinking.And he kept this ability all his working life.
