However, I felt compelled to view this film as I put together the content for a new class I am developing on Film Genres, including the Western.This film has been described by other critics as the greatest Western, and the apex of the collaboration of Director John Ford and the actor John Wayne. After viewing the film, I can only say that I am totally mystified by this canonization. The 1956 film was set in Texas, yet filmed in the famous Monument Valley in Utah &#x96; you have to love it that our fictitious white homesteaders would build their ranches right in the shadow of these magnificent geological treasures. The Native Americans in the film are depicted as dime store caricatures &#x96; the war paint on Chief Scar looks as ridiculous as the actor they put into this getup, who was German born Henry Brandon, whose other roles included Persian, Arab, and Asian villains. His In'juns kill the white men's cattle with their spears, leave the carcasses to rot on the open terrain, and try to kill and scalp as many white men and women as they can. They also are depicted as completely inept in every shootout in this film, so their off screen success is just one of many inconsistencies in this film. Wayne's role in the film is that of a former Confederate officer, Ethan Edwards, who has a pathological hatred of Native Americans. In the beginning, he arrives at his brother's cattle ranch after an absence of many years; all is happy, here in Monument Valley. Everyone in this family looks like they bathe three times a day and always are wearing freshly pressed clothes. Even the cute family dog looks incredibly clean and well groomed is this supposedly dusty environment. But the family hears that the hostile In'juns are after their cattle; Ethan goes out to investigate, finds the speared cattle to be just a diversion, and comes back to find the homestead in flames; everyone dead except his young niece, who has been kidnapped by the Co-manch(rhymes with ranch),as Ethan refers to them. He also refers to his adopted nephew Martin as ahalf-breed because he is 1\/8th Cherokee, and later also calls him a blanket-head. And thus begins the search. Ethan is a man's man he desecrates the dead body of one Native American by firing bullets into his eyes, because with  what that Comanche believes, ain't got no eyes, he can't enter the spirit-land. Has to wander forever between the winds. That Ethan even knows Native American spiritual traditions seems inconsistent with his character. Ethan shoots buffalo just to deprive the Native Americans of their meat, and shoots people in the back, including the totally inept Native Americans after one shootout, and a barkeep who gave him a tip about Scar's whereabouts --- Ethan wants to get his money back. The studio campfire scenes are embarrassingly phony, even for the 1950's, particularly compared with the beautiful Monument Valley shots. The lack of any ambient sound other than the crackling of the fire is both bizarre and surreal.Ethan and Martin trade a group of witless Native Americans some hats, and Martin unknowingly gets one of the Native American women given to him in the trade as a wife. Of course she is overweight and has a silly smile, so this served as great comic relief in the film. They even call her Look, because it is easier to pronounce than her actual name.The rescue of the niece from Chief Scar manages to stand out as the most ridiculous scene in the film. The niece is portrayed by the very young and badly miscast Natalie Wood. When Ethan and his nephew track down Scar, he invites them into his tee pee and there we see Natalie, hair in pigtails and dressed in buckskin; all involved immediately recognize what is at stake, but Scar has enough manners to not kill the men he has invited into his own tee pee. Ethan and Martin skirt the issue, take their leave, and then pitch camp on the other side of the river; Natalie comes running after them and speaks the only Native American word she seems to knowOntomea (Go away). These are my people now. Go away. Oh yeah, very convincing. Then Ethan makes a move to shoot his niece because she has turned into a buck, and he is sure that is what his late sister-in-law would have wanted. Better dead than in'jun. After the inevitable battle, Ethan chases his niece down &#x96; we think he is going to kill her &#x96; but in the end, he gathers her up on his horse, and takes her back home to the ranch. The message? We should be cheering for Ethan, the mythic American hero, who stands up for all that is right and all that is good, particularly in confronting the savage Native Americans. And I contend that Ethan is really no different than the real John Wayne, who was even quoted this way in an interviewI don't feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them (the Native Americans) ... Our so-called stealing of this country from them was just a matter of survival.

I found it on beloved LoveFilm one Sunday night when I was at a loose end and in need of distraction... And what a movie to provide it!Peter Pan eventually found love back in London England in the form of Wendy's granddaughter Moira. But Captain Hook, stuck back in Neverland forever fighting off the Lost Boys and Indians, has not forgotten or forgiven, and kidnaps the now very-grown-up, business-orientated Peter's often-overlooked kids, holding them as leverage for Pan's assured return so Hook can have the final war with him and the Lost Boys he's been gearing up for for years. Peter returns with the help of Tink but, has completely forgotten everything, including his own real identity over the course of the years in which he's been in the Real World. So both sides start to prepare for a fight to the death, prepared to do anything to gain an advantage...Robin Williams makes a convincing Pan, who has literally given up his wild youthful days and forgotten all about them, needing to be put through rigorous tests before he can remember and do what is needed of him. With such a role and how it has been written, one needs to balance the comedy with the more serious moments with gravitas and, proving even here that he's not just a comic actor, Williams strikes it very right!Dustin Hoffman and Bob Hoskins make a wonderfully formidable and naturally funny team as Captain Hook and Smee, bouncing off each other splendidly (and probably with a good pinch of ad-lib) in several scenes. It's hard to believe it actually is Hoffman under all those eyebrows, but with his usual Method style, completely throws himself into the role and is unidentifiable within it. (As a fellow actor, I'm in awe of when actors can do this)A lot of the kid actors in it as well are quite obviously having the time of their lives and hold a good performance despite their young years. Maggie Smith is on top form, as per, as Wendy, as is Caroline Goodall, most recently seen as the bitchy Duchess Cecily in The White Queen (who'd have thought it???)It is a wonderfully feel-good movie, even with the short but hard- hitting death scene (no spoilers here, me laddie!) The added touch of making Neverland a young kids paradise to live in, complete with proper treehouse with a built in skate park, weapons which fire eggs and rotten tomatoes and a real Us vs. Grown-ups feel to it, makes one feel both nostalgic for one's own childhood and proves very endearing in the overall feel of the film, without being overly twee. We also see a very endearing take on where Peter Pan may originally have come from, which is never really touched upon in the book (if memory serves). The more tender moments are of course needed in such scripts, coming in the form of realizations of what life's important moments are and should be. These softer moments are also very reminiscent of Barrie's writing style, where happiness is mixed with reflective sorrow, proving almost surprisingly shocking. It completely takes you back to being a kid, its overall message being it's okay to get older, but you don't necessarily have to give up being a kid.

He is committed, and she grows up with a new family, eventually going to college, where she joins a sorority. Due to a memory block, she doesn't remember that the sorority house was her childhood house. Her brother senses her presence in the house and escapes so he can finish the job he was unable to complete. The whole story of this movie is all too familiar, being a die-hard fan of the Halloween series I felt like I was experiencing déjà vu. With that being said, it was not a bad movie. It had pretty decent acting, and the story is also good but not original. The killer reminds you a lot of Michael Myers. And this has gotten lots of controversy.

To spell it out, this is a Gaumont British Picture Corporation picture, studio of Hitchcock's The 39 Steps and The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934), as well as Supersonic Saucer, Transatlantic Tunnel, Mister Hobo, and First a Girl, which all sound absolutely fascinating. They really do. British movies of the 30s generally didn't have the budget or polish of Hollywood productions, and it shows here in the weak editing of early scenes and the slender script. However, they've assembled a first rate cast, except for an annoying Anna Lee. Gaumont did two things you would not have seen in a Hollywood movie of the time Location shooting in Africa and giving a black man lead billing. It was a joy seeing Paul Robeson starring in a dignified role. And the African footage is probably better done than the studio scenes. Britain had regularly scheduled flying boat routes to Africa carrying British Imperial mail and passengers in luxury, so the producers would have felt more comfortable shooting in Afria than their California counterparts. This is the sort of movie I would have watched as a kid on a black and white TV. The slow pace would have benefited from the commercial breaks -- six minutes an hour back then, unlike today when the movie provides a break from the commercials. As a kid I did not feel compelled to rate everything I watched, but if I did, I would have rated it It's OK. I wonder if kids could bear to sit through it today?However, there is a reason that adults should watch this, and a way to get kids interested, maybe. King Solomon's Mines (1937) -- and the book -- is the granddaddy of all those adventure, lost world movies, like the Indiana Jones franchise. Watch this and then Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) back to back. Then consider what they have in common, and you will find the secret formula, kids. (No, I'm not going to spell it out, it's a secret.) As a follow up, ask the kids which is better, and why, and not just the latter's colour and special effects. Now if you really want to get creative, ask the kid to write a story based on the secret formula. Who knows? H. Rider Haggard wrote this story on a five shilling wager with his brother that he couldn't write a story half as good as Treasure Island, which I haven't read lately, so I can't judge whether King Solomon's Mines is, indeed, half as good. No word on whether his brother paid up. But maybe you will raise the next Spielberg. King Solomon's Mines is no gem, but it is historically significant. I have noticed of late (say, the last 15 years or so) many British posters complaining about American movies on the slightest pretext, if they are war movies, because they don't provide sufficient credit to British soldiers for whatever battle is portrayed, and if they are the story of an American horse, that they don't mention British horses (or Australian horses, if the reviewer is an Australian). One British reviewer had the gall to call Seabiscuit American imperialist propaganda. Perhaps I am missing something here, such as when it was that America became imperialist holders of colonies, and what this has to do with a race horse in the Great Depression?Of course, King Solomon's Mines is not British imperialist propaganda. Britain is not an imperialist power that holds colonies around the world, and never was. Britain never waged war to protect its colonies against rebellion and revolution, and it certainly never killed innocent, unarmed men, women and children engaged in peaceful protest. Instead, this movie shows how noble and kind these rich British non-imperialists were, at heart, unlike the poor Irishman who would have stolen the treasure map from a dying man, and the poor Irish woman, who was a chronic liar and thief, not to mention the homicidal maniac tribal chief. Umboba was a good man, but then he was educated by the British and knew how to speak English (with a Jersy accent), so he was civilized. But even so, he only was able to gain his rightful throne with the help of the British noblemen. No, King Solomon's Mines is not British imperialistic propaganda. It just fell through a wormhole.This, however, does not solve the problem. The only solution is for Britain to ban the importation and viewing of all American movies, because, according to a consensus of British viewers, they are all American imperialist propaganda, no matter what they are about. While we are waiting, if you are British, please, please, please stop watching Hollywood movies. You obviously don't enjoy them. May I suggest some classic British gems like Leave It to Smith, Britannia of Billingsgate, East Lynne on the Western Front, A Cuckoo in the Nest, and Turkey Time?As a footnote, the documentary series Queen Victoria's Empire - 2001 (an excellent programme) has some scenes of traditional African native dancing. It is at night around a campfire, so it is hard to see the details, but the costumes have some of the elements shown in King Solomon's Mines, and the drum rhythms are very similar.

In fact, I thought this film was going to be tedious to watch. So, when I put it In my DVD player (or PS2, take your pick) at half ten last night, I decided to finally sit down and watch Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece knowing that it won't be finished until half 1 in the morning. When the last scene finished, one word was left in my head, Perfect. This film is nothing short of perfection. And it wasn't the action that impressed me the most; it was the character interactions in the scenes leading up to the climax. Each Samurai (I won't name them as my spelling and memory of the names is anything short of terrible) has a fair amount of screen time, story and overall character.It became easy to distinguish one character from the next as their behaviour was so unique. Three samurai's stood out to me through. One was the young rookie who fell in love with the daughter of a farmer. I felt that this was the Samurai we were meant to relate to. In fact, out of all 7, I would say he is the most different; his skills aren't as well polished as the others. The Second is the Samurai who commands the Village the most, looking like both a leader and a father figure to the young Samurai. The Last was the Samurai who seemed like the heart of the small army. He was not only funny but also had some emotional depth to him. In fact, I will say when he leaves his post and dresses up as a Bandit, that it when we see the biggest development in his character as he see witnesses the effect of his actions. The story was very simple, a Village are being attacked by Bandits and they need the help of Samurai. All they can afford to pay this with is three meals every day. It's the way it's handled however which makes the film stand out among the crowd. It would be rather easy to make this an action orientated film. But it's split into three episodes. They are; 1. The Gathering of Samurais 2. The Preparation for the Attack 3. The Attack Each episode plays out slowly, giving us time to see some character development while the story progresses. In fact, my favourite of all three episodes has to be the first. It was a joy to see who they will get to aid them in their battle. While watching this part, I felt I was there and seeing these other Samurais where like meeting up with old friends. The atmosphere in these scenes feels very authentic. While most films will condense the first two acts so they become an hour altogether, this film spreads them out to build tension for the third act. In fact, the film feels like a journey. We are seeing these characters improve their relationships with each other over the course of the film so that the final episode will be as emotional and as action packed as we should expect. I could go into even greater lengths in saying how good this film is, but I will just be repeating what others have said. In fact, to talk about the whole film would fill books and I just don't have the time to do so. However, something I do feel the need to talk about is the Music, which is actually pretty epic and something I feel gets overlooked. The best part is when the farmer learns about his Daughter and the young Samurai, the music that plays and that moment just fits in way too perfectly. It gets the emotion just right and makes the event stand out the most throughout the film. Without it, that one moment would have just passed away without a glimmer, but with that one soundtrack, all the tension building around that one sub plot had reached a glorious climax.Now, spoiler alert if you have not seen this, but I found the ending to be rather depressing. It stated that even through the Villager's had won the battle, the Samurais hadn't. This is a rather sad moment in the film as it told us that the Samurais had become friends. Now that four of them are dead, it's like their friendship has split. This was hinted earlier in the film when three of the Samurai go and attack the house, one of the Samurai says if we lose one, we lose the battle (or it was something along those lines) which gave further evidence the seven had indeed lost.Overall, the film was one of the best I've ever seen. Definitely it my top 20. While I can't recommend this to everyone (if you rate Transformers as your favourite trilogy of all time, then I would say stay away from this) I would say give it a try. Besides, it's easy to see that it had a huge influence on Star War, even the wiping transitions are in here. Easily a 10\/10.

I could go into even greater lengths in saying how good this film is, but I will just be repeating what others have said. In fact, to talk about the whole film would fill books and I just don't have the time to do so. However, something I do feel the need to talk about is the Music, which is actually pretty epic and something I feel gets overlooked. The best part is when the farmer learns about his Daughter and the young Samurai, the music that plays and that moment just fits in way too perfectly. It gets the emotion just right and makes the event stand out the most throughout the film. Without it, that one moment would have just passed away without a glimmer, but with that one soundtrack, all the tension building around that one sub plot had reached a glorious climax.Now, spoiler alert if you have not seen this, but I found the ending to be rather depressing. It stated that even through the Villager's had won the battle, the Samurais hadn't. This is a rather sad moment in the film as it told us that the Samurais had become friends. Now that four of them are dead, it's like their friendship has split. This was hinted earlier in the film when three of the Samurai go and attack the house, one of the Samurai says if we lose one, we lose the battle (or it was something along those lines) which gave further evidence the seven had indeed lost.Overall, the film was one of the best I've ever seen. Definitely it my top 20. While I can't recommend this to everyone (if you rate Transformers as your favourite trilogy of all time, then I would say stay away from this) I would say give it a try. Besides, it's easy to see that it had a huge influence on Star War, even the wiping transitions are in here. Easily a 10\/10.

I watched this movie back to back with the original Black Christmas hoping to be thoroughly entertained by two classics of the genre. I was only half right. I have to say the lesser known and criminally under-rated BC walks all over Halloween which sadly didn't live up to the hype. Black Christmas has a far more interesting screenplay with some very lively and interesting characters, some deliberately humorous moments, a great non-intrusive but suspense- heightening score and an intriguing premise of telling you nothing at all about the villain. You don't even see him. HW was originally intended as a sequel (prequel?) to BC and I suspect Carpenter was trying to flesh out the villain's character and explain his behaviour. What he failed to understand is that it was the very fact that there was no explanation for the killer in BC and no way to identify with him that made the killer so intriguing & scary. This lame back-story of Michael Myers doesn't add a thing to the suspense, in fact it diminishes it even more because the back-story is silly and thin. A complex & interesting back story might have worked but replacing the eery mystery of BC's killer with a half-a**ed background was a mistake.Both movies have pretty bad acting but that's a product of the times. JLC was marginally better than her ridiculous co-stars but no better than anyone in BC. Mind you, she didn't have much to work with given the script for HW is one of the lamest horror scripts I've encountered.There were some very neat camera shots here and Carpenter plays with texture and lighting well in his direction but it wasn't enough to make this movie a genuine classic (regardless of how many people think it is - emporer's new clothes n all that!!) He kept some of the clever plot techniques and camera work from BC, thank goodness, including the POV shots from the killer (but we lost those half way through along with the intrigue) and the nasty phone calls (altho this wasn't used anywhere near enough or as successfully as it was in BC). But there was no humour or interesting characters in Halloween. Just a bunch of boring teenagers doing boring things and some wholly uninteresting children.Also the ending made no sense whatsoever. You can't have things both ways. If you're going to write a lame back-story that explains that the killer is a just some psycho bloke who killed his sister - ie HUMAN - then you can't have him surviving so many fatal attacks. It's just plain ridiculous. If they'd kept the killer a mystery as BC did then they could get away with that ending.
