But what-a-minute? If Wood was such a bad director why do Midnight screenings of double-bills -- Plan 9 from Outer Space and Glen or Glenda, sell-out today? Burton seeks the answer by giving the viewer a look behind the man and the rag-tag group of devotees he leads. And who better to play the man than Johnny Depp. Fresh off his work with Burton on Edward Scissorhands, Depp continues to show through his undercharged brand of acting that he is truly destined for greater things. He plays Wood as the arch-typical gee-whiz nice guy who at any moment could come undone from the unvented personalities floating inside him who demand an audience. Is it any shock that this man should become a director; projecting that need to draw from people something that may be unknown to even them? He is the Sunday-Morning garage sale hunter looking for treasure among junk. The people he collects don't understand his vision but trust him implicitly. Leading this group is Martin Laundau playing Bela Lugosi which such ferocity he seems to be channeling him. I have never met Bela Lugosi, but I am convinced that if I had I would of met a washed-up actor addled by drug abuse and embittered by the Hollywood's throw-away style of handling old actors. Wood cannot help but gush when meeting Lugosi for the first time and continues to treat him as a legend throughout their relationship. Does Lugosi continue to help in Wood's endeavors for the money or the adulation? The talent does not end with Landau and Depp. This talented cast produce standout performances Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, Bill Murray, Mike Starr, and Jeffrey Jones are never unbelievable in their pursuit of Silver Screen immortality. Put all these personalities together in the struggle to make movies and Ed Wood never lets the viewer down.

This film with it's through-running leathered ribbon of homoerotic masculinity continues in more recent films like Mike Hodges' I'll Sleep When I'm Dead.

It does make a fair attempt at cutting loose, although Glazer is a prodigious magpie in addition to Roeg (note the cast also includes a Fox brother)he also borrows from Guy Ritchie (sharp, kinetic-montage editing); even an orgy scene grafts a louche decadence across from the Kubrick of Eyes Wide Shut.Although the film builds itself narratively around a heist, the title suggests the real interest is in the id-motives of the male characters. Ben Kingsley's remarkable, humanity-void Logan is the exceptional character of the three lead men. His own attempts at sexual intimacy are motivated more by the need for a bar-stool anecdote than personal fulfilment &#150; the suggestion of a homoerotic act during the story reproduced to assert his constricted straightness. Conversely, Winstone's Gal has a charming closeness to a young Spanish boy and Ian McShane's glacial Teddy Bass first appearance of the film is in flagrante implicato with a man. Both women are strong characters too, frightened only by the physical capabilities of the men. Teddy ends up as the most frightening character for simply understanding the lot of them.Despite all this the film has plenty of humour and impressive set pieces &#150; the opening pool-side sequence a case in point. Let's hope that Glazer can recover from the commercial setback of Birth to continue such thoughtful film-making. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"5 October 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Glazer is a man who has obviously absorbed Nick Roeg's Performance.
