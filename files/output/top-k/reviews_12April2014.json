Mathew Broderick plays Mr. McAllister, the boring teacher with a boring wife, who aspires to greatness, mucks up an affair, and ultimately loses his Omaha teaching job. Doesn't sound like that much fun, does it? Well, he also gives a good performance and the film has a good supporting cast with many colorful characters. Underage Tracy Flick is a bit of a sexual firecracker as well, and gets McAllister's best friend and fellow teacher fired after she has sex with him. (Reese is supposed to be only 17 here.) Witty, funny and clever, but not as much fun as I expected--and also dirtier. When Tracy Flick won the election, she should have turned a cartwheel, don't you think? A highly-successful film at the box office, but I think Roger Ebert over-rated this film.

Wayne plays notorious gunslinger Quirt Evans, who is wounded and nursed back to health by a Quaker family. The sweet and innocent daughter, Penelope (Gail Russell), falls in love with Quirt. But the gunfighter's got some bad guys to deal with, chiefly an hombre named Laredo (Bruce Cabot). Quirt will have to choose between his way and the Quaker way, which means choosing Penelope or the gun.John Wayne is really good in this one. He's a very underrated actor that is often slighted by people that don't like the man, usually because they don't like his politics or something along those lines. But he was actually a very good actor who brought depth to most of the characters he played. Here he gets to show his softer side and it's one of his best performances from the '40s. Gail Russell is young and very pretty here. She does a great job in one of her two best-known films (the other being The Uninvited). Russell and Wayne have terrific chemistry. It's sad how her life turned out as she had the potential to be one of the greats. Harry Carey, Sr. plays a grizzled old marshal dubious of whether Quirt can change. As was often the case, he stands out above the pack. An excellent actor who could say more with a smile or a look than most could with a page of dialogue. Amusingly there are characters in this movie named Hondo and McClintock, both names for future Wayne characters. It's a charming and enjoyable western that fans of the Duke will love but also I think people who don't normally like westerns can enjoy.

And thus it has everything a young male adult would want to see in this type of comedy. Or may, I say, something a person would expect in a movie which is trying to be next American Pie, but set in college. It has got nudity, sex, sex tape, drinking, toilet humor, four friends and Stifler!!! Yes, the Stifmeister himself!! And I am not saying this because the actor who played Stifler is here, but because he is basically the same character. Only difference is the name and that he has no Finch to humiliate or pick up on. So, is this movie next American Pie? Not at all. I desperately wanted to like this movie but I didn't. They forgot that it was clever writing that made Pie and Mary awesome and not the nudity, foul language and bodily fluid itself.First let's talk about the main characters. I have already talked about the Stifler , so let's move on to other characters. The characters are pretty much forgettable and have no personality, except Tom Green's character but not for a good reason. He is there because the director thought Well, people nowadays like funny scene which have shock value, so why not hire a guy with weird face named Tom Green since he already has a lot of fans on MTV. But he is neither shocking nor funny; he is just creepy and illogical like a psycho killer in dark alley, which appears in your nightmare. Then there is a skinny guy named Kyle who is a no-risk-taker nerd. Anyone who has seen a lot of comedies know that this type of character becomes brave by the end of the movie and we root for him when he stands up against bullies, just so director can show that he cares about something called character development. But unlike Harold of Harold and Kumar Goes to White Castle or any nerd from Revenge of The Nerds, this guy has no personality and it is difficult to root for him. Then there is our lead character, Josh who like Kyle has no personality and it is difficult to care for him since he is so bland. The only character I liked was Rubin since he makes the nerds look cool and you come to care for him. Not even the Stifler like character was funny, since he was underused.Unlike American Pie, which was feminist since it had a few male characters who respected women and had some well written female characters, this movie makes mistake of being misogynist. When you are making a sex comedy with heart, you can't make it misogynist. This movie is misogynist because the characters of Stifler\/ Sean William Scott and Tom Green treat women like sex object and are often not punished for it. It is misogynist because female characters are underwritten here. And this makes it less feel good.And finally, the funny scenes. The only time I probably laughed was when car crashed. And maybe a few more scenes. But most of the time I didn't laugh. There was a scene in which one of the character politely asks a waiter to change his food since it contains sugar and he did not take sugar in the mornings. The waiter not only gives the same food but also makes it dirty with his farts before Kyle thinks he is eating different food. This is supposed to be a hair gel moment but instead of being memorable and funny , it is just gross. It fails due to two reasons - a) We can see the joke coming since it is so predictable, thus it loses its shock value and b) There was no logic why waiter behaved rudely. Hair Gel scene worked in real life, this could actually happen. And then there is Tom Green who is never funny even when he is eating rat or showing his butt. I am not saying I was bored by this movie, but this was something I could have avoided and may not see again in my life.

I went to see this with my best friend when it released in theater's. There were 2 other people in the theater.What really makes this movie so bad is the awkward scenes that draw on way too long. The movie had potential with the comically spooky plot, but the script, directing and casting ruined it.The only two actors\/actresses that make this spoof movie funny in a couple parts are Marlon Wayans and Anna Faris. Marlon Wayans is responsible for one of the most memorable scenes in spoof movies, which I won't ruin for those who haven't seen it. Anna Faris does the best she can with the script she's been given, it would have been much worth with someone else cast in her place.Don't get me wrong, I'm an Anna Faris fan, but this movie almost killed the franchise for me.Some of what was supposed to be funny, instead made me completely uncomfortable as with anyone else I watched it with.I rate this a 2\/10 because of two funny scenes that prevented the movie from being completely boring and not watchable. Scary Movie 3 saves the franchise from extinction in my opinion. The first Scary Movie was quite good for its time in my opinion as well.I hated Scary Movie 4, but Scary Movie 5 was a a lot more funny as a spoof movie than I expected.Please remember that the Scary Movie series is a collection of spoofs, not parodies. Movies like this are designed to be completely unrealistic.

It possesses such realistic dialog and probing commentary on the desperate nature of human beings in search of love. Also it demonstrates Woody's unrequited love for Manhattan, which is firmly stated in the introductory narration. Although I haven't been to Manhattan, I have read numerous accounts stating that Woody Allen has captured the essence of Manhattan in this movie. This is what it feels like. Through Allen's lenses we are also seeing what a City is supposed to be.I was amused to see Woody Allen's character Isaac sticking up for the 'only genius' he knows in Cinema - Ingmar Bergman. Referring to a new acquaintance who is the lover of his best friend, Isaac says to his 17 year old girlfriend, '...if she had made one more remark about Bergman, I would've knocked her other contact lens out.' The dialog is so sharp that it's always one step ahead of the viewer. You really don't know where the next frenetic thought of Allen will take you. Just don't expect someone to shrug their shoulders, slap their forehead and with mid-rising intonation say d'uh! It's not that kind of comedy. It's not the show, 'Friends'. Manhattan contains perplexing and often dark adult humor. The other aspect of Manhattan which struck me was just how influential it must have been on the hugely successful 90's sit com Seinfeld and the subsequent Larry David self mockumentary, Curb your Enthusiasm. The characterizations and conversation themes are just too similar. Elaine Benes is almost a direct copy of Diane Keating's 'Mary'. Her mannerisms, modern feminism attitude and even her outfits have an uncanny resemblance to Allen's Mary. Jason Alexander did say in the Seinfeld Chronicles that when he auditioned he did basically a straight up imitation of Woody Allen. 'It was all Woody' or words to that effect.Woody Allen is a wonderful actor. It wasn't something I had fully appreciated until seeing this. The real eye opener for me however was his 17 year old lover played by Mariel Hemmingway. Her sensitivity and vulnerability shone so brightly - a truly incredible and touching performance, and from one so young.Oh and other things like the irrepressibly beautiful soundtrack and cinematography. Well that would require another review to mention the superlatives of each.I found Manhattan a completely different movie to Annie Hall, but in an improved sense. The story seemed to have more vigor and I admired the acting a heck of a lot more. I might have been expecting too much from Annie since it was my first Allen movie and it had been parodied to death. I need to see both movies again to be more conclusive about which I like better. One thing is for certain, 'Manhattan' is a fantastic dating movie. If you want something to provoke an insightful relationship conversation with your better half, then Manhattan is it! I'm looking forward to seeing Hannah and her Sisters next. Supposedly Allen didn't like Manhattan, which surprises me, but I wonder was it because its totality or essence was a bit close to home? I've noticed his more recent movies involve stories which far less encapsulate an 'introspective' Woody and more driven towards showcasing other uniquely neurotic characters and harder driven stories and plots.It's this Jewish humour (is this the Lenny Bruce genre everyone talks about?), which undoubtedly is my favourite style of humour because it is so witty and introspective and doesn't belittle the audience's intelligence.... on the contrary.The verdict? This is essential 'Allen', me thinks, despite what Woody may think.

So, I wondered what exactly it means and stumbled upon two definitions (Merriam-Webster and TheFreeDictionary.com)- a region marked by intricate erosional sculpturing, scanty vegetation, and fantastically formed hills - usually used in plural- A heavily eroded arid region of southwest South Dakota (exactly the place where the film plot occurs) and northwest Nebraska. The Badlands National Monument in South Dakota was established in 1939 to protect the area's colorful rock formations and prehistoric fossils. After I've resolved that mistery I'll bring up arguments in relation to my perception and understanding of this Malick's first feature film.Film starts with Holly's narration (Sissy Spacek) about her mother's death and explanation of how her father coped with that. On the other side of Fort Dupree (South Dakota), Kit (Martin Sheen) is working as a garbage collector and making jokes with his colleague Cato. Kit and Holly met each other accidentally Kit, arrogant greaser kid, was walking after hard day on job and Holly, kind of introverted young girl, was playing in her street. From the moment Kit saw her, he started conversation and flirting. Holly, who was living under strict rules of her father, liked him. It is probably much better to describe it not like her attraction to Kit, rather attracted to idea that she is likable to some young, handsome guy (at some point in film, she describes him as attractive as James Dean).As Holly's father didn't allowed them to have any kind of relationship and after Kit's attempt to talk with him failed &#x96; he tried to run away with Holly. He spied on their house, and waited for Holly and her father to leave, than broke into their house and started packing Holly's clothes. They returned earlier than he planned and after Holly's father wanted to report him for breaking in, things went wrong and he killed him. They both made decision to burn down the house (making it look like suicides) and attempt getaway. Driven by Kit's violent nature and Holly's unquestionable, naive love for him their getaway turned into killing spree.From the beginning I felt atmosphere like in Terry Gilliam's films. Not exactly surreal, but somehow magical. Everything happens with easiness. Everything is smooth. Music is so chill-out, calm and I felt movie as an adaptation of fairy tale.There is famous quotation by Jean-Luc Godard and it goes All you need for a movie is a gun and a girl. In Badlands you have it all. As the films goes on, one can think it is just that. Guns, rifles, killings and a lot of romantic clichés. But, most important element was constantly present from the moment story begins. Both protagonists have similar characters they are shallow, banal, they lack focus\/attention (Holly isn't interested in anything particular while Kit is changing jobs very often...). They both seems alienated\/introverted &#x96; they have no friends, no real contact with their Self; Holly's father seems to be very restrictive and introvert person while we know very little about Kit's family (only short dialogue with his uncle is captured) &#x96; if he had any.Their almost unbearable easiness of killing people is reflected in complete absence of empathy for their victims. Even though Holly didn't killed anyone she showed no remorse, sense of guilt, or any kind of empathy towards victims suffering. Even when her father was killed by Kit &#x96; she was more in the state of shock and never looked back. Also, not that Kit tried to reconsider any of his acts of violence and killing; he's rather trying to justify every victim as collateral damage and as a way of preservation of their love. It was clear from the beginning that they've no moral course to follow and their road will be paved with blood and without any redemption.When their getaway finally ended by Kit's peaceful surrender to sheriff and his assistant, we could witness interested dialogue between them. They've found him as interesting, charming and witty young man. Sheriff's assistant even expressed fascination with Kit's appearance and told him that he's something special. Suddenly, both Holly and Kit became celebrities. People come to see their arrest, they've got full media attention.

To the director, writer, Eddie Murphy, hell&#x85;everyone, anyone involved. (At least, I imagined that line from the movie being used more accurately.)Wait a moon minute, was The Adventures of Pluto Nash supposed to be a comedy? Or funny at all? I waited one hour of 90 minutes for one laugh, one chuckle. Not a won. Not once did I even smirk.If it was supposed to be a Sci-Fi adventure, it also had no gravity or originality. Or fun. It was just listless with poorly designed sets that looked like they were stolen from far superior films.Was it supposed to be a romantic drama? Nope. No chemistry here from any of the actors, male\/female or otherwise.Finally, I guess it could've been attempting to be a futuristic, action flick. This had as much action in it and looked as futuristic as Schindler's List did.Never once, since 2002, had I ever wanted to see this movie. Had it not be for those awesome guys over at the How Did This Get Made podcast, I would have lived out the rest of my days oblivious to how horrid this picture was.Pretty much, in this failed sitcom pilot of a feature-length, (hasn't been funny in about two decades) Eddie Murray plays the title character on the moon and when his nightclub is threatened by the building of a casino &#x96; wait, stop. I know it's been a couple of weeks since I've seen this, but is there not A WHOLE LOTTA ROOM ON THE MOON to build this casino without having to do the age old if you don't sell, I'll make your life hell so I can become rich on your land plot?Actually, screw this movie. There is absolutely nothing here worth mentioning or thinking about. Eddie looked bored and uninterested, as did most of the other cast. I do, however recommend you listen to the How Did This Get Made podcast on this. Not only is it enormously hilarious, but they give you a bunch of fun background information that makes this project all the more worthless.* * * Final thoughts Okay, I've never been an Eddie Murphy fan.

Such problems that was notable during this decade are oil shortage, inflation, government scandals and even wiretapping. Few of those films portrayed the future as nightmarish and startling. But, what if there was a future where people can live in a world of pleasure? What if you didn't realized the difference the truth and the untruth?Well, then, look no further to Logan's Run. The setting for the movie takes place in the 23rd century. In this futuristic society, you can live in a world full of pleasure and wonder. However, there's two problems. One there are no old people in this society. Everybody is young and free. Two By the time you reached the age of 30, your time is up. Furthermore, a silver crystal that is imprinted on the palm on your hand tells you if you're time is up. If it blinks red, your time is up. If it doesn't blink, you still have time to live. Our main protagonist is Logan 5 (Michael York). Logan is a sandman, which means that his job involved hunting down runners who don't want to get renewed in a place called the Carrousel. But, when Logan himself decides to become a runner himself, he put his own job and his life on the line. His female lover, Jessica (Jenny Agutter) decides to run with him. Together, they venture out of their own domed future society and into the abandoned world of Planet Earth. By this time, in the year 2274, Washington D.C. has become a derelict. When Logan and Jessica come across a old man (Peter Ustinov), they realized that they can live old and never have to die. Knowing that their futuristic society is being manipulated to believe in lies, Logan and Jessica must exposed the truth before they get captured by the Sandmen. The movie isn't great science-fiction, unlike other serious science-fiction movies like A Clockwork Orange or 2001 A Space Odyssey. But, it's silly and fun to see, even if you're seeing some obvious plot holes. What I like most about Logan's Run is that the premise is similar to Brave New World. In that book, the main characters, Bernard and Lenina escape from their own society to venture out into a very different and very much ignored society that seems to be forgotten. Yet, there are some interesting things that Logan's Run provides to the viewers and those who are science-fiction fans. And that is, the world isn't always truthful when you manipulate people to believe in lies. That kind of concept is mirrored in this movie, similar to a real-life event that occurred in the 70's that really shocked a lot of people. That event was Watergate.As for the special effects, they seems to be dated since this film was beaten one year later by the massive success of Star Wars. The art- direction is very well-done in this film, even though it was shot on location in Texas. Beside all of the dazzling, yet dated special effects, there's a interesting character named Box, who is a metallic robot that attacks Logan and Jessica. He may not the next HAL 9000, but Box is somewhat special, even though he may be the most unlikeliest movie robot I've seen, beside the fact that he's voiced by Roscoe Lee Browne.The acting in Logan's Run is good, but at certain times in the movie, I felt that the actors were simply enjoyed being in this future world. York is convincing as the hero, so is Agutter as Logan's lover. As for the supporting cast, I admired the supporting character of the old man, played by Peter Ustinov. Ustinov's character seemed to be way out of Logan's and Jessica's lead when it comes to their presence. Farrah Fawcett-Majors plays a small role as a beautician, who gets caught up in Logan's run from the law. I'm not sure if Fawcett is in the right role in this movie, but I accepted what was the screen because of the film's zany and quirky view of future values.Logan's Run won a Special Achievement Academy Award for Visual Effects and was also nominated for 2 Oscars.

That policeman is Ben Richards and when he escapes television producer Damon Killian is determined to make his the star of 'The Running Man'. This is a game show where criminals are hunted down and killed by 'stalkers' while the public bet on the outcome. Richards is captured after he is turned in by network employee Amber Mendez and soon finds himself in the game with two fellow escapees. These two are members of the underground movement determined to expose the lies the network is airing so not only do they want to survive they want to find the location of the network's satellite unlink which is inevitably hidden in the game zone. They are soon joined by Amber who was caught trying to find the original footage of the massacre. When these runners start to turn the tables on the stalkers the public start to support them&#x85; something Killian can't allow so he starts changing the rules and things get even more dangerous for the runners.When I first watched 'The Running Man' back in the eighties I thought it was great stuff with plenty of action and some great one-liners&#x85; sadly it hasn't aged as well as other Schwarzenneger films of that era like 'The Terminator' or even 'Commando'. The one-liners are just too cheesy and don't sound like lines made up on the spot like a good one-liner should. The action is pretty violent at times even though very little blood is shown; when people get shot with automatic weapons they just fall over without bleeding!

It is however, one of a handful of first films that may be bettered by its sequel, in this case Cameron's 1991 epic, big budget follow up, Terminator 2 Judgement Day. For me the second film had always been my favourite of the two (I try to ignore the rest) but on re- watching the original recently I have a renewed love of the film. It's grittiness and dark tone, devoid of humour is very refreshing in this sanitised PG-13 age of Hollywood that we now live in. Arnold Schwarzenegger is unrelentingly menacing as the titular killer cyborg from the future and it's a stunningly well paced film. It's very much a product of the 80's with its garish fashion and big hair but that's in no way a bad thing as it's setting is very much an integral part of the plot. T2 is grander, more epic and still near flawless but I fear it suffers from too much exposure if there can be such a thing. It's been on TV a million times and released more times on various home video formats than almost any other film and is maybe a little too much in the public lexicon to be viewed outside of itself and it's own reputation. The original has a lower budget feel that gives it an almost indie quality that has done it no such harm. Set over the course of two days and nights there is a greater sense of intimacy with the first film and a dark tone that's very film noir (or should that be Tech Noir?). Schwarzenegger, in only his second major role, has only a handful of lines but commands the screen with a presence that sets him apart as one of cinemas truly frightening villains. When you consider that both OJ Simpson and Lance Henriksen had been considered for the role prior to the Austrian Oak it's lucky that Cameron made such an inspired casting decision and it would be interesting to peer into an alternate universe and see what the other two actors would have brought to the role. Linda Hamilton shines as Sarah Connor, the T-800's timid, shell-shocked target and by film's end it's great to see her transition into something that more closely resembles (at least mentally) T2's ripped killing machine mom. Michael Biehn also gives a superb, understated performance as the battle-weary human soldier sent back to protect Sarah. The sense of impending doom he conveys whilst never straying from his mission adds immensely to the film's pre-post-apocalyptic theme. There are many great plot devices and technical flourishes that I could mention such as the idea that Kyle is the father of the man that sent him back to the past in the first place, a mind bending temporal causality loop that gives food for thought and debate. On the technical front the cinematography, iconic score and soundtrack and tight editing are all first rate. One particular scene representative of these aspects so finely melded by Cameron's deft hand is the scene where Sarah and the Terminator first meet. As the cyborg walks through the Tech Noir nightclub and approaches the table where Sarah sits waiting for the arrival of the LAPD, the film shifts into a dreamlike slow motion as Sarah knocks a bottle onto the floor, bends down to pick it up just long enough for the T-800 to miss her as he passes. The 80's rock music is now muffled by the dilation of time as the score comes in, Sarah gets up and sees not the cyborg but Kyle staring at her from across the bar oblivious to the fact that her hunter has now doubled back and is about to see her. Just as the slo-mo tension reaches a climax Kyle sees what Sarah hasn't as she lifts her gaze to the machine as he pulls out a gun, Kyle does the same and we kick back into real-time and all hell breaks loose. This level of tension is maintained for the film's duration and marks it as one of cinema's most efficient thrillers. We've since seen what Cameron can do with huge budgets and established effects houses and there's no denying that he's more than made his mark on the movie world. However, one can't help but think that ever since he declared himself King of the World, his films, quality wise at least, have diminished. I still lean towards T2 as the more personally fulfilling entertainment spectacle of the two films but back in 1984 with very real limitations made worse by on-set woes, problems with studio heads and the lack of any prior reputation, Cameron made best of what he had and that estimated $6.4 million budget was stretched further than anyone could have imagined. He ended up giving us a classic film of such quality that it made sure that the audience, like the Terminator himself, would indeed be back.

Funded by pledging production company New Line (whose only previous credit had been the classy thriller Alone in the Dark), A Nightmare on Elm Street would not only introduce the world to the grotesque bogeyman that is Freddy Krueger but would also move the horror genre into the world of merchandise and shameless marketing, something which only the likes of Star Wars had previously dabbled in. Shot on a relatively small budget with an inexperienced crew, the movie would eventually cement the careers of both the director and studio.Fifteen-year-old Tina Gray (Amanda Wyss) once again finds herself in a creepy old boiler room. There is a constant drip of water from the pipes and the sound of metal being scratched again metal rings through her ears. The place is playing tricks on her, a goat suddenly appearing from nowhere and a constant feel that someone is watching her. Eventually, that presence appears in the form of a burnt man (Robert Englund) in a striped old jumper, a dusty Fedora and a menacing glove on one hand, with long claw-like blades attached to each finger. Suddenly, Tina wakes up screaming, which summons her sleeping mother from the other room. She looks down at her clothes to discover four identical tears, which match perfectly with the blades that he had attacked her with. Grabbing the crucifix off the wall, she curls up in bed and prays that she will survive the night.The following day at school, Tina is discussing her scary nightmare with her friends, the sweet-yet-naive Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) and Nancy's boyfriend Glen Lantz (Johnny Depp), when Tina's criminal lover Rod Lane (Nick Corri) appears behind them, making crude references to the kind of dreams that she has been giving him. That night, with the mother away, Tina has invited over her friends to keep her company, when an uninvited Rod arrives to spend some quality time with her. Later, as everyone is sleeping, Tina begins to violently toss around in her sleep, before her shirt is ripped open and four deep cuts simultaneously appear across her stomach. As Rod watches, her body is lifted into the air by an unseen force and is dragged up the wall and onto the ceiling, suddenly falling back down onto the bed, a shower of blood praying over him. As Glen and Nancy break the door open, Rod is seen escaping out through the window.Struggling to cope with the death of her best friend, Nancy begins to have bizarre visions, including seeing Tina's corpse in a body bag being dragged through the halls of the school whilst she whispers her name. With Rod arrested for the murder, Nancy witnesses the burnt man appearing in the cell and willing the bed-sheets to wrap around his neck, pulling his body up to the ceiling to the guards who find him believe that it was suicide. But, as the mysterious figure begins to terrorize them, Nancy learns the truth about him and his death at the hands of her mother and the parents of the neighborhood. The man is Fred Krueger, a child murderer who had been released on a legal technicality and so the parents of the victims, determined to keep him from hurting any more children, had tracked him down to his boiler room and had burnt him alive. Somehow, he had found a way to come back and was now haunting the children of the guilty in their dreams.Much of the success of A Nightmare on Elm Street relies on the performance of Englund, who provides a subtle-yet-sinister turn as the demonic antagonist. Somehow made all the more creepy by his co-stars towering over him (perhaps giving the indication how he is a dirty old man), Englund's most famous role prior to Krueger was as a friendly alien in the hit sci-fi show V, so Craven's decision to cast against type was an inspired move. Langenkamp also shines in her role, adding a vulnerability and intelligence that makes the character's development from victim to violator an interesting transition. Sadly, much of the supporting cast provide weak performances, most notably Depp, making his screen debut. Lacking the charisma and depth he would apply to his later roles, Glen is a one-dimensional character who, whilst adding a little humor to the story, does little to provide genuine sympathy.elmstreet3Craven's achievements with both the creation of Krueger and the endless delivery of surreal set pieces are remarkable. Having previously been responsible for a slew of movies that ranged from average to awful, A Nightmare on Elm Street saw the filmmaker developing as both a storyteller and a director. Occasionally adding a touch of brilliance when exploring the illogical nature of dreams (the stairs that inexplicably turn into goo being a perfect example), Craven's script was more of a deranged fairytale than a straightforward slasher. One theme that the film explored that had become a common aspect of his work was the protagonist being forced to become as savage and calculating as the antagonist, something that had also been explored in The Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes. Despite a laughable epilogue that had been included at the insistence of the producer, A Nightmare on Elm Street was a highly original and inventive horror that successfully lived up the promise of its unique concept.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"12 April 2014","score":"","review":" As the slasher boom came to an end, with most major studios bowing out of the genre and leaving just the independent filmmakers to milk the concept dry, a struggling director by the name of Wes Craven had penned a script full of original ideas and inventive deaths, far from the standard butcher knife kills which had become commonplace with the countless Halloween clones. Funded by pledging production company New Line (whose only previous credit had been the classy thriller Alone in the Dark), A Nightmare on Elm Street would not only introduce the world to the grotesque bogeyman that is Freddy Krueger but would also move the horror genre into the world of merchandise and shameless marketing, something which only the likes of Star Wars had previously dabbled in. Shot on a relatively small budget with an inexperienced crew, the movie would eventually cement the careers of both the director and studio.Fifteen-year-old Tina Gray (Amanda Wyss) once again finds herself in a creepy old boiler room. There is a constant drip of water from the pipes and the sound of metal being scratched again metal rings through her ears. The place is playing tricks on her, a goat suddenly appearing from nowhere and a constant feel that someone is watching her. Eventually, that presence appears in the form of a burnt man (Robert Englund) in a striped old jumper, a dusty Fedora and a menacing glove on one hand, with long claw-like blades attached to each finger. Suddenly, Tina wakes up screaming, which summons her sleeping mother from the other room. She looks down at her clothes to discover four identical tears, which match perfectly with the blades that he had attacked her with. Grabbing the crucifix off the wall, she curls up in bed and prays that she will survive the night.The following day at school, Tina is discussing her scary nightmare with her friends, the sweet-yet-naive Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) and Nancy's boyfriend Glen Lantz (Johnny Depp), when Tina's criminal lover Rod Lane (Nick Corri) appears behind them, making crude references to the kind of dreams that she has been giving him. That night, with the mother away, Tina has invited over her friends to keep her company, when an uninvited Rod arrives to spend some quality time with her. Later, as everyone is sleeping, Tina begins to violently toss around in her sleep, before her shirt is ripped open and four deep cuts simultaneously appear across her stomach. As Rod watches, her body is lifted into the air by an unseen force and is dragged up the wall and onto the ceiling, suddenly falling back down onto the bed, a shower of blood praying over him. As Glen and Nancy break the door open, Rod is seen escaping out through the window.Struggling to cope with the death of her best friend, Nancy begins to have bizarre visions, including seeing Tina's corpse in a body bag being dragged through the halls of the school whilst she whispers her name. With Rod arrested for the murder, Nancy witnesses the burnt man appearing in the cell and willing the bed-sheets to wrap around his neck, pulling his body up to the ceiling to the guards who find him believe that it was suicide. But, as the mysterious figure begins to terrorize them, Nancy learns the truth about him and his death at the hands of her mother and the parents of the neighborhood. The man is Fred Krueger, a child murderer who had been released on a legal technicality and so the parents of the victims, determined to keep him from hurting any more children, had tracked him down to his boiler room and had burnt him alive. Somehow, he had found a way to come back and was now haunting the children of the guilty in their dreams.Much of the success of A Nightmare on Elm Street relies on the performance of Englund, who provides a subtle-yet-sinister turn as the demonic antagonist. Somehow made all the more creepy by his co-stars towering over him (perhaps giving the indication how he is a dirty old man), Englund's most famous role prior to Krueger was as a friendly alien in the hit sci-fi show V, so Craven's decision to cast against type was an inspired move. Langenkamp also shines in her role, adding a vulnerability and intelligence that makes the character's development from victim to violator an interesting transition. Sadly, much of the supporting cast provide weak performances, most notably Depp, making his screen debut. Lacking the charisma and depth he would apply to his later roles, Glen is a one-dimensional character who, whilst adding a little humor to the story, does little to provide genuine sympathy.elmstreet3Craven's achievements with both the creation of Krueger and the endless delivery of surreal set pieces are remarkable.

Because sometimes, that's how I feel. Sure, I'm all open for people to share their opinions but there's just some out there that make me want to tap them to a chair and play the movie over and over again.Anyway, that's exactly how I feel with this movie. I've read reviews where they judge even the music they use during the film, which is ridiculous - the music choices in Coyote Ugly just help make it.This is a story about Violet Sanford; an aspiring musician who moves to the big apple in hope of getting a record deal. So, that doesn't happen as easily as Violet had hoped and in order to gain some easy money, she becomes a bartender. Oh! But, not just ANY bartender - A Coyote. Sounds fun, doesn't it? They dance on the bar and guys buy them drinks (which they subsequently hardly ever drink). There is a lot of reason behind the making of this film. I mean, for one, it's a Jerry Bruckheimer film; Mr Big himself. So, just because the movie isn't something along the lines of CSI Miami, doesn't mean it's not worth the watch. It's funny, it has romance, drunk hot guys... drunk hot girls! C'mon, you have to hand it to them - the whole cast made the film good, great even.Personally, I love this movie, I would've given this a 10\/10 BUT I had to take into consideration what other people thought. I mean, whether you watch the Director's Cut or the cinema version, it's still worth the watch. Don't take any one review for granted, watch it for yourself. Solicit Opinions. It's totally worth it. I give this 8\/10. Thankyou!
