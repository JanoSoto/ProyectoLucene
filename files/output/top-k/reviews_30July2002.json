When I watched The Spy Who Shagged me in theaters, I fell on the floor laughing. And when I viewed Goldmember last week, I'm pretty sure I cracked up so loud that I cried! There is no arguing that all three AP movies are incredibly stupid. The first two had a few clever spin-offs of James Bond, but by the third time around, any sign of intelligence in the franchise has completely dissipated. So what? I GUARANTEE you that if and when you watch Goldmember, you will laugh harder than you ever have in your entire life. The premise of AP3 -- if there is any -- is as follows Dr. Evil (who delivers even MORE laughs than the previous two combined) ~*~ POSSIBLE SPOILERS ~*~ has tried Preparations A-G to suck a solid gold meteor to Earth and melt the polar ice caps. Since all of these attempts have failed, he is now resorting to -- prepare yourself -- Preparation H (deep, menacing music playing)! By this point in the film, my sides were already beginning to split. Verne Troyer is hilarious (and I mean, HILARIOUS) as Mini-me AND Mini-Austin, and Seth Green has some surprising tricks up his sleeve as Dr. Evil's rebellious son, Scott. Also, Michael Caine makes a wonderful addition to the cast as Austin Powers' GROOVY dad who is kidnapped for some odd reason that I can't remember. Beyoncee Knowles is so-so as the roller-disco dancer, Foxxy Cleopatra (I still think she should forget acting and stick to singing), but the audience is left wondering what in the world happened to Felicity Shagwell? However, plot holes are of no importance and are easily forgotten while you are watching the movie. Oh, and remember in the first one how Dr. Evil said his mom was a prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet, and his father often complained that chestnuts were lazy? These issues are -- at last -- fully explained, and the final truth about Dr. Evil's genealogy is bound to shock you! By the way, have I mentioned the title character yet? Mike Myers plays yet ANOTHER character in AP3 (the tally is now four), an evil genius with a peculiar accent and a fancy for eating pieces of dried skin named Goldmember. All these aspects are utterly hilarious, but there is ONE flaw with Austin Powers that has been present in all three so far the unfunny and utterly moronic sexual innuendo. Why does Jay Roach continue to spoil his drop-dead funny movies by including sex jokes that don't even deliver a giggle? Oh, well you can't have everything!

His line delivery is so weird, and if it wasn't for the poor makeup and costume he's been given you would be drawn to conclude it was evidence of substance abuse.

If it isn't Forest Whitaker laughing for no apparent reason all the time, it's Barry Pepper trying to make up for his lack of dialogue through a series of grimaces. It's usually at this point that a reviewer will say, 'ah yes but...' and offer up either the story, action or effects as solace. Sadly none of these are executed any better, and in some respect much less so. The plot (and I assume the book makes more sense, please) has such big plot holes in it you could drive a Death Star through them. For example, the aliens take over earth and set about plundering it, a thousand years later they have still to notice a large building called 'Fort Knox' which is full of gold. And when I hero's want to fight back they - amazingly - come across a squadron of flyable Harrier jump jets. That they learn to fly in simulators in a few days. Moronic isn't the word.

Many Sci-Fi film's are endearing enough that you can allow them some artistic license, no film is ever going to get as much as Battlefield Earth needs, ever. So in summary- bad acting of a diabolical script of ridiculous story presented in a banal way with negligible style.

Its cult following virtually demanded a sequel which came out years later, Escape from L.A. which wasn't nearly as good.  But Escape from New York (and The Thing) definitely obliterated Kurt Russell's cutsie-boy Disney child actor image.  Good for him!

I'd seen the show a few times in the past, and thought it was highly offensive and pointless.  I was in someone's dorm room in March or April and he put this movie on. Why is he playing this foolishness? I thought.  But then, oh my gosh.  From seeing this movie, I went from a complete un-fan of South Park to loving it.If you look beneath the language, this movie is SO DEEP!  There were few parts I didn't like The Terrance & Philip movie --- of Fire.  Passing gas isn't & never has been funny to me.  I understand, however, that it was necessary to give us a glimpse of the movie to provide a basis for the parents' anger of this movie & its effect on their children.  I don't believe the song Uncle F---- was necessary, though. The devil & Sadam Hussein didt't do anything for me. It's possible there was a deeper meaning with that, but if so, it went over my head.I don't have room to go into full detail of all of the satire of this movie, so I will list some elements The egotistic quality of Americans -- The Canadians were all drawn funnily, as if Americans think them below us. The fact that people always blame others instead of themselves (at the end of the song Blame Canada, the lyrics are We must blame them before somebody thinks of blaming us) The way people put celebrities on a pedestal & exaggerate their accomplishments  (What Would Brian Boitano Do). The way parents get caught up in causes etc that will supposedly help their children instead of spending time with their children (Kyle's mom).There are many more, but I haven't seen the movie in a while, so I don't remember them all.Since seeing the movie, I have downloaded & watched most of the South Park episodes & even in those, you find great social commentary. My favorite episode is There Goes the Neighborhood when the rich people move in.  I sat in shock the first time I watched it because of the last line.If you understood the reason of Satan & Hussein in the movie, please let me know, cause I really would like to appreciate it also.

Requesting their services is park owner Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson), who has cause for alarm after discovering that someone, or something, is turning his college-age clientele into zombies. Disneyland, it's not.Scooby-Doo, directed by Raja Gosnell, is an uninspired mongrel that proves Hollywood still hasn't learned from its past mistakes in converting half-hour cartoons to megaplex fodder, the recent flops The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Josie and the Pussycats notwithstanding. (Nor has it gotten the hint that Prinze and Lillard should not work together again following the debacle that was Wing Commander.) The inferiority of screenwriter James Gunn's lifeless mystery plot is clearly evident, it has to be camouflaged with a combination of inane dialogue, overuse of CGI, and a truly atrocious ending.The task at hand is so crucial that Scooby and Shaggy find time on the side for an abundance of pot jokes and a lengthy farting contest. Yes, a farting contest. If Mystery Inc. can regularly afford to partake in such nonsense in between solving crimes, then, by God, I want their jobs. There is also a fair amount of cleavage on display courtesy of nearly every female in the picture from the extras to our heroines. Oh boy, flatulence competitions, drug humor, and big breasts. Always the reliable staples of quality family entertainment. Things sure have changed in the course of three decades, haven't they?If there's anything positive that surfaces from this dreck, it's the fact that Lillard is dead-on with Shaggy's voice and goofy mannerisms. On the other hand, Prinze has the looks and charisma of a Ken doll as the egotistic Fred. Gellar and Cardellini portray whiny, two-dimensional personalities Daphne continuously complains about being the damsel in distress while knocking out hulking bodybuilders, and Velma continuously acts jealous of Fred. It's a shame that Atkinson, who can easily act circles around this cast, receives less screen time than an insignificant voodoo master (Miguel A.

There's no reason at all to care about any of these characters.However, the treatment of the human cast is a milquetoast in contrast to Scooby's role. Something is definitely amiss when the famous namesake of a summer blockbuster movie does little more than act as Shaggy's computer-animated armpiece while failing to believably blend in with any of his surroundings. The best example of a film combining cartoon characters with real-life environments remains Who Framed Roger Rabbit? And that was 14 years ago.While immortalizing pop culture phenomena worked for Spider-Man, it doesn't even come close here. Just labeling Scooby-Doo a pop culture phenomenon is absurd.
