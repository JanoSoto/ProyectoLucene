It was just a good quality story about a mildly retarded woman, Carla Tate, and her simple dreams (and loves) in life.  Its honest simplicity, refreshing story, and gut-wrenching emotion make it very endearing and will win the hearts of movie-goers everywhere.A story about a mildly retarded woman doesn't seem like the most exciting premise but Carla isn't like any slow woman I've ever met.  She comes from an extremely well off family, went to a nurturing special school and became very well-rounded and optimistic, and is exceptionally beautiful.  The only indications that she is handicapped are her slow speech and her simplistic view of life, and in that respect she is much like Forrest Gump (but her character is not.)  Carla is also very likable.  She is very honest, in a way that is embarrassing to her family, is very refreshing and humorous. (Carla has several good one-liners throughout the film.)The film TOS is about Carla returning from her special boarding school and trying be achieve independence from her overprotective rich family.  She does not try to be financially independent nor is she trying to sever all ties with them, but much like a college student-she is trying to break out from under her parents protective wing and experience life and love on her own terms and she does.She is allowed to go to a technical university for regular students, as she puts it, after persuading her parents for quite some time, and it is here that she meets her first love, Daniel. Carla also gets her first apartment to her absolute delight.  Daniel is also mildly retarded and his sweet affection wins Carla's heart. Daniel, however, is quite an embarrassment to her rich, conservative, country-clubbing family and they are constantly concerned that 'this boy that will just take advantage of you, Carla.' Their worry is just genuine snobbish concern and Daniel and Carla finally do win their parents acceptance and blessing.TOS is not only a love story but an excerpt of Carla's life.  She is very captivating and by the end of the film, you are so charmed by her, that you are just so happy for her, if not proud.  The film pulls you along at a steady pace, taking you through the ups and downs of Carla's world and experiencing the good and bad sides of human nature with her, from her point of view.  It is also a happy-sad movie.  It has a happy ending, but sad because Carla has to face some ugly truths about people when her good faith is abused because she wants to live in the 'real' world.  Juliette Lewis has some fabulous performances during Carla's red-faced, vein-popping, gut-wrenching sobs.  You cannot leave the movie theater unaffected by the life of Carla Tate.  Even my macho boyfriend shed a few tears even though he won't admit it (but they hit my arm.)TOS was memorable because it was a movie that revealed a side of retarded people largely unexplored.  The film was not about her family, or her friends and how her illness effected anyone else in her life but a film about her and her independence.  In fact, Carla did not consider herself physically challenged and I never felt sorry for Carla; none of the empathy I felt for her was out of pity, but understanding.  This movie treated this retarded couple as individuals that wanted what nobody caring for them could give them-the pride and dignity of being independent.

Not many films can make you laugh as much as you cry - but this certainly is one of them. Roberto Benigni (the Robin Williams of Italian cinema) is wonderful in the lead role and has done a fantastic job with the directing and script, too. His real life wife, Nicoletta Braschi, is great as his wife who, although she herself is not Jewish, demands to be taken to the camp with him. Credit must also go to little Giorgio Cantarini who is brilliant as Giosue (Joshua), Benigni's son, who he tries to shield from the horrors of the holocaust. The film starts in typical slapstick Benigni fashion in 1939 Italy as Guido and his friend Ferruccio go to Arezzo, a Tuscan town. On the way, Guido meets Dora, a schoolteacher, and falls for her. Once they arrive in town, Guido and Dora meet again on a number of occasions, each time Guido surprises Dora - his principessa. Although Dora is engaged to another man, he still fights for her and eventually wins her over in a memorable scene which uses so many set pieces that have been set up in the previous 30 minutes. The film continues 5 years later and now Guido and Dora are married and have a little boy called Giosue. This is where the film begins to get a little dark as Giudo, Giosue and Dora are taken to a concentration camp and the men and women are seperated. Guido pretends to Giosue that it is all a game and that they must obtain 1000 points to win the prize of a real tank. Schindler's List was a very powerful film and had very graphic scenes portraying the holocaust. Benigni does not show as many graphic scenes but you can still feel the pain and suffering. La Vita e Bella should win the Oscar for Best Picture - but unfortunately I don't think it will as Hollywood is bound to overlook the most powerful, funny and emotional film of all the nominees.

To see the universe in that opening scene was breath-taking, and the reason for it all coming out of Ellie's eye becomes blissfully apparent in light of the end, for her journey was just as much a physical as well as an emotional and spiritual one.  The photography was superb, alternating  between expansive sweeps of the landscape and the universe, and close, intimate shots of the characters, symbolising the potential for &#145;the unknown' as well as an equally important knowledge of all that is familiar &#150; contact with our own people.The irony manifested itself in how Ellie, who denounced Palmer's ability to possess complete faith in God, ended up being the advocate of such a faith, though of a different strand; she could now appreciate Palmer's passion. Remember that Biblical verse that when paraphrased reads something like `The man who is not willing to give up his life will lose it, but he who is willing will gain it'?  This religious imagery correlates to how Drumlin lost his life in pursuit of personal acclaim, while Ellie, who admitted that she would freely give up her life in pursuit of life's tormenting questions, gained it in such a memorable and satisfying way.  She found inner peace, having made contact with two intelligent races; one of the skies, and one of her own kind.  The dried up cliché alluding to aliens `We are not alone' begins to take on a new meaning in a multitude of dimensions in light of this brilliant movie.I read this wonderful &#145;blurb' about Contact, and I think this following line delineates the film, and why watching Contact became such a defining film for me `Ellie's personal voyage will take her beyond theory, beyond knowledge , beyond experience, to the realization that true vision is ultimately the union of fact and faith.'  This duality of life and true fulfilment which arises from the reconcilement of contrary beliefs is surely a theme of the film evinced through the conflict created by science vs. religion, fact vs. faith, vision vs. reality.Carl Sagan's novel was also a fulfilling pleasure to read.  I thought that the message in pi was an absolutely crucial element of the book, the implications of such a message being that there is an all-powerful &#145;force' behind the universe, which brings order to disorder, and such a &#145;force' we might call God.  So possibly, C.S's novel did prove the existence of God. Maybe the recurring &#145;C' pattern in the film, (the &#145;quadruple' system Ellie saw near Vega, the sands in her father's hands and that which she holds in the end), is indicative of such order &#150; that no matter how large or small an event, i.e, whether a message is written in the sky or in the palm of one's hands, order is present, and implies a powerful force guiding the universe.I am incapable of seeing many, if any, faults with this film &#150; I truly cannot understand why anyone would think it contrived or the same as something as brain-numbing and gung-ho as `Armageddon'. It is truly an intellectual film with meanings at many levels &#150; and so thought-provoking!  Perhaps Matthew McConaughey's representation of Palmer Joss was a little unbelievable, and the thrice-repeated `It's an awful waste of space' phrase that connected Ellie to her father and Ellie to Palmer can be seen as a tad too sentimental on the one hand, but on the other, it serves to punctuate the potentiality of the physical universe, and the human mind, which, in C.S's case, conceived this book.  Jodie Foster is magnificent, but then again, isn't she always? The extraordinary passion Ellie exhibited was admirable &#150; her innate sense of wonder balanced by a stabbing loneliness, born out of the premature departure of a dear parent.I love Contact because of its poignant humanity, the sense of wonder that resonates so strongly throughout the film and indicates the strength of that wonder which inspired C.S in the first place, and because it searches for meaning so idealistically, while still, necessarily, maintaining the sometimes harsh realities of life (personified by James Woods' unsympathetic and skeptical Kitz).To those who hated the ending, you obviously missed a crucial component of the film, that of possibility and potentiality.  To have Ellie return with tangible evidence of alien existence would demolish all the credibility that Robert Zemeckis attempted to create by showing the current American president referring generically to the event of the message being discovered, the decision to build the machine, etc.  The ending was crafted in such a way as to enable a choice by the viewer\/reader to be made &#150; just like how C.S equally respected those in his book who chose to pursue a path of science or religion.  We, the audience, are allowed to decide what really happened, and this makes Contact an almost interactive and therefore a more intimate experience.Contact has something to say to everyone, and has real meaning that cannot help but whisk viewers and readers alike to some thrilling place.  To those who thought the film predictable, and had not previously read the book, I would say that you must be VERY creative if you managed to anticipate all that Contact had to offer.  But for everyone who was as much inspired by this magnificent film as I was, here's the most important lesson to be derived from both the book and the film `For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love.'  This enlightened message, dreamt up by Carl Sagan, makes me even more convinced that a book critic who said of Carl Sagan `with terrestrials like him, who needs extras?' is exactly right.

This religious imagery correlates to how Drumlin lost his life in pursuit of personal acclaim, while Ellie, who admitted that she would freely give up her life in pursuit of life's tormenting questions, gained it in such a memorable and satisfying way.  She found inner peace, having made contact with two intelligent races; one of the skies, and one of her own kind.  The dried up cliché alluding to aliens `We are not alone' begins to take on a new meaning in a multitude of dimensions in light of this brilliant movie.I read this wonderful &#145;blurb' about Contact, and I think this following line delineates the film, and why watching Contact became such a defining film for me `Ellie's personal voyage will take her beyond theory, beyond knowledge , beyond experience, to the realization that true vision is ultimately the union of fact and faith.'  This duality of life and true fulfilment which arises from the reconcilement of contrary beliefs is surely a theme of the film evinced through the conflict created by science vs. religion, fact vs. faith, vision vs. reality.Carl Sagan's novel was also a fulfilling pleasure to read.  I thought that the message in pi was an absolutely crucial element of the book, the implications of such a message being that there is an all-powerful &#145;force' behind the universe, which brings order to disorder, and such a &#145;force' we might call God.  So possibly, C.S's novel did prove the existence of God. Maybe the recurring &#145;C' pattern in the film, (the &#145;quadruple' system Ellie saw near Vega, the sands in her father's hands and that which she holds in the end), is indicative of such order &#150; that no matter how large or small an event, i.e, whether a message is written in the sky or in the palm of one's hands, order is present, and implies a powerful force guiding the universe.I am incapable of seeing many, if any, faults with this film &#150; I truly cannot understand why anyone would think it contrived or the same as something as brain-numbing and gung-ho as `Armageddon'. It is truly an intellectual film with meanings at many levels &#150; and so thought-provoking!  Perhaps Matthew McConaughey's representation of Palmer Joss was a little unbelievable, and the thrice-repeated `It's an awful waste of space' phrase that connected Ellie to her father and Ellie to Palmer can be seen as a tad too sentimental on the one hand, but on the other, it serves to punctuate the potentiality of the physical universe, and the human mind, which, in C.S's case, conceived this book.  Jodie Foster is magnificent, but then again, isn't she always? The extraordinary passion Ellie exhibited was admirable &#150; her innate sense of wonder balanced by a stabbing loneliness, born out of the premature departure of a dear parent.I love Contact because of its poignant humanity, the sense of wonder that resonates so strongly throughout the film and indicates the strength of that wonder which inspired C.S in the first place, and because it searches for meaning so idealistically, while still, necessarily, maintaining the sometimes harsh realities of life (personified by James Woods' unsympathetic and skeptical Kitz).To those who hated the ending, you obviously missed a crucial component of the film, that of possibility and potentiality.  To have Ellie return with tangible evidence of alien existence would demolish all the credibility that Robert Zemeckis attempted to create by showing the current American president referring generically to the event of the message being discovered, the decision to build the machine, etc.  The ending was crafted in such a way as to enable a choice by the viewer\/reader to be made &#150; just like how C.S equally respected those in his book who chose to pursue a path of science or religion.  We, the audience, are allowed to decide what really happened, and this makes Contact an almost interactive and therefore a more intimate experience.Contact has something to say to everyone, and has real meaning that cannot help but whisk viewers and readers alike to some thrilling place.  To those who thought the film predictable, and had not previously read the book, I would say that you must be VERY creative if you managed to anticipate all that Contact had to offer.

The half-brother's live-in boyfriend is a bit more goofy, and soon succumbs to the feminine wiles of Deedee, whom we learn has motives other than sexual companionship sparking this sudden interest in his conversion. Conveniently for the storyline, the half-brother has been left financially well-off by the death of his previous boyfriend, a successful stockbroker; (one guess as to the nature of the fatal malady).The now pregnant Deedee and the half-brother's former companion vanish, setting into motion a plot which introduces various other characters, and a frantic and often confusing search for the runaways.

And 20 licks from the bullwhip for whomever decided to mangle Volcano Girls by Veruca Salt for the opening credit sequence. Since the director is clueless, Pam Grier and Marilyn Manson are wasted in two small roles. Those are definitely two people who would be intriguing to watch more on the big screen. A last minute performance by The Donnas cannot save things, although it comes close. Mercifully, people stayed away from this mess over the weekend.------ 1 ","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller"},{"date":"23 February 1999","score":"","review":"  Yikes!
