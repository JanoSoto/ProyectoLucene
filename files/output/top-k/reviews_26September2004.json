This plot was good and was a kind of plot I would think of and get really into. I liked mostly everything in this movie. Everything was just neat and creative but the ending got everyone on there feet. Jeff Bridges realises his neighbor is a terrorist and is trying to take his son away from him and blow up a big building up where he works. So Jeff in the end is trying to not let his neighbor do that but everything gets mixed up and when it's all over your like whoaa, that was weird. I still liked the movie and it was all a good thriller but the ending I say was a little weird.Hedeen's outlook 7.5\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"26 September 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Arlington Road was a cool movie with good performances by Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins.
