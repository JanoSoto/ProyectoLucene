Die Hard has made the exception.I was entertained by the three other movies, being able to forgive some silliness and just enjoy the action and the characters. Die Hard 2 just made me uncomfortable several times.The whole idea is good enough, and the settings aren't that bad. Some plot twists are decent. Some action scenes don't suck. That's it.Main character McClane is handled poorly. He's too serious when he should crack some jokes, and tries to be funny at wrong times. It feels cheap after the first movie. At least the third one, Die Hard with a Vengeance, took McClane back on track with a sense of self-irony.

I'd been given to understand that this was an exercise in spectacle, bad taste and overspending; nobody ever thought to mention, for one thing, that it was actually *funny*.Not in a bad way, either. We don't laugh at the acting we laugh at the sharp repartee, the sly visual digs (Cleopatra's rump rolling into view as Caesar urbanely remarks that one has to see the back-side of any piece of merchandise to judge its true merit), and at Cleopatra's artful manipulation of all the men in her life, down to the Roman soldiers, sent to march her off, whom she assures sweetly that they need not be afraid of the dark if she accompanies them. This is not the sort of thing one expects from an Epic; these are the qualities of a far more intimate drama, and other, more recent, blockbusters would have done well to mark the effect.On the other hand, the film really is as spectacular as promised, with the sort of eye-opening luxury that can only be afforded by pictures of an era where there could be no possibility of computer enhancement. The budget is all on screen, and it largely pays off the only scenes that really do look fake are some of the sea-battle shots. The spectacle of Cleopatra's entrance into Rome really is jaw-dropping as it just cranks up and up -- when you think you've seen everything it comes up with yet another surprise, right down to the ebony statues that turn out to be alive. There are a few very 'Sixties' shots later in the film of Elizabeth Taylor with hairstyles looking like Elizabeth Taylor rather than like a daughter of the Ptolemies, but otherwise her appearance is an absolute knock-out. Other people have commented on her 'shrill', 'thin' voice; I couldn't hear that at all.The main trouble I had with Cleopatra was Mark Antony. As seen on screen (there are rumours that more flattering scenes showing the character's initial achievements after Caesar's death were among the first material to be cut), the character is an unshaven, bibulous, self-pitying heap, a loser more or less from the start (in his first scenes in the second act, he is already drinking heavily), and it is not at all clear why Cleopatra, a shrewd political operator, would want to have anything to do with him, much less fall in love with him more or less overnight, still less gamble her vast possessions on backing him against Octavian the reviewer who described the character as less a tragic fallen hero than one who 'starts at the bottom and topples sideways' hits the nail cruelly on the head. The love affair one simply has to take more or less as read, on the grounds that the plot requires it. Burton and Tayor may have been passionately involved Antony and Cleopatra are less than convincing, and I'm not sure if it's the fault of the actors, the script, or the scenario.Despite the age difference, Cleopatra's scenes with Julius Caesar are much better from this point of view. Where the doomed-lovers tragedy struggles somewhat, the earlier liaison is played out almost along romantic comedy lines -- it's hard not to find oneself applauding for the spirited young Queen all the way as she bargains and smart-talks her way into power, bidding what is initially a very thin hand up into the sole rulership of Egypt -- but we also get to see Caesar's tactical brilliance, both in military and political matters, and the duelling couple are ultimately well matched. My only problem with Rex Harrison's otherwise admirable depiction of the character was the unfortunately close resemblance achieved by Sid James in Carry on Cleo; a wonderful send-up (making ingenious use of the abandoned sets from Cleopatra), but a slightly distracting one in this context! Martin Landau stands out, as always, as the honourable and somewhat harassed Rufio, dealing intelligently and diplomatically with the whims of his superiors, and loyal unto death. Roddy McDowall is weak and yet sinister as a blond Octavian, initially inconsequential and ultimately all-consuming; he is a consummate politician, not a military commander, and it is easy to sympathise with the characters who would prefer death to falling captive into his hands. I found Robert Stephens notable in the small part of Germanicus, Antony's man in Rome, and Cesare Danova as Cleopatra's servant Apollodorus.Despite its four-hour running length, the film never seemed too long. This is no Heaven's Gate, and it's no Lord of the Rings either; character is rarely allowed to be subordinate to spectacle, never mind special effects, and the dialogue is surprisingly good. I don't know how well it would come across on TV (frankly, it's hard to imagine, given the sheer scale of some of the shots), and, like Gone With the Wind, the first half is better than the second.

The best known example of this is the original first The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, from 1978.This movie is far less known and also isn't blessed with such a great title.

It also of course helps that the movie at times uses 'home-video' movie, in which we get to see the killings\/rapes from the perpetrators perspective alone.It isn't a movie that has a true beginning or ending, in terms of having a conclusion that puts an end to things. It has instead now got one of the best possible endings thinkable, that is shocking, unexpected and satisfying even though it doesn't put a definitive end to things.The real story of Henry Lee Lucas is even more shocking and disturbing but also a lot longer and more complicated of course.

This movie obviously had to make some choices and even decided to not only exclude a lot but also to change and add certain elements, which all strengthens the story in this case.

He is constantly chiding the other coroners that scientific means should determine the cause of a person's death, not what first impressions may dictate. Consequently, the others send me him to Sleepy Hollow, New York, a Dutch-heritage town in upstate New York, where three people have been decapitated. The most ghastly facts are that their heads have not been found and that a headless horseman is the one responsible for their murders. Ichabod scoffs at that idea, for he believes there must be a reasonable explanation for the murders. Of course, he is determined to bring the murderer to justice. But, once he gets to the town, he sees the horseman himself, in the act, and he is horrified. Now, four people are dead and. more importantly, how can this supernatural killer be stopped? Ichabod meets a bevy of folks to hatch some ideas, among them a beautiful, wealthy young lady named Katrina (Christina Ricci). Katrina tries to provide Ichabod with clues, even as others in town work to help him find the answers, too, for everyone lives in fear that he or she will become the next victim. Will Ichabod be able to end the killings? Now, first let me state that I believe Burton to be a great film director, as evidenced in Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, Batman, and Mars Attacks, among others. However, Hollow is dark and repugnant and, I believe, his worst film. It has an abundance of bloody scenes that are not scary, just repelling, and it has little comic relief, save for the fact that Depp faints from time to time, when things go badly. Yes, the art direction is quite good and so is the cast, including Depp, Ricci (looking very lovely), Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Christopher Walken, Jeffery Jones, Lisa Marie and other talented players. Yet, even they can not rise above the film's dark themes and gory scenes, all of which leave the viewer feeling tremendously cheated out of a good tale. I do not feel it does justice to the original story and it certainly will not please any movie viewers looking for a rousing spine-tingler. The best advice I can give is, if you like the cast and\/or Burton, go ahead and see what you think of the results. As for me, I am dreadfully sorry I watched the film, as its excesses are most depressing indeed.

David Mamet's brilliant screenplay is a lesson in how to write dialogue. Taken from the play of the same name and embellished somewhat for the movie, Mamet's words are obscenely poetic, hypnotic in their effect and almost musical in their cadence. And make no mistake, they are obscene. The work 'fuck' is used something like 150 times in the course of the 100 minute film. But again, as anyone who has ever been part of this world can attest, that is precisely what makes 'Glengarry Glen Ross' so unflinchingly believable; that's how these people talk. Mamet hasn't created these characters so much as he's simply listened to them. Alec Baldwin's profane 'motivational' speech (written especially for the film) early on gives audiences an electric jolt of an idea what they're in store for. There is no pretense of appealing to the salesmens' better natures, no idealistic claptrap about what being a professional sales rep means; everyone in the room is far too jaded for any of that. No, Baldwin's spiel focuses on the only two things that matter to these men anymore- greed and desperation. Greed first prize in this month's sales contest is a new Cadillac. Desperation third prize is, you're fired. You're all losers, Baldwin tells them, you don't even deserve to be in my presence. And the salesmen are largely unfazed; you can see them sizing up Baldwin and his presentation, making mental notes. Jack Lemmon plays the oldest of the sales crew, someone who at one time made a lot of money selling real estate supposedly, but the bullshit and lies are so thick in this office, there's no way of knowing if that's true. Al Pacino is the current hot-shot; slick, smooth and cold-blooded. Pacino's sales pitch to Jonathan Pryce in a corner bar is such a masterpiece of obfuscation, we are no more certain of what Pacino is talking the customer into than Pryce is. All that one knows is at the end of it, he has a signature on the proverbial dotted line. Ed Harris and Alan Arkin are the other two salesmen and Kevin Spacey plays the office manager. Spacey in particular portrays an early version of the kind of chillingly heartless character he would become known for throughout his career. The title of 'Glengarry Glen Ross' refers to a set of leads (potential customers) that the real estate company management is dangling in front of the luckless reps, like some sort of golden carrot. They are to be handed out to the most productive salesmen. As with most high-pressure sales jobs, it's not even a matter of what have you done for me lately, it's more like, what have you done for me in the last thirty minutes? The last sale made is forgotten as soon as it's over and then it's on to the next. Yes, this movie is depressing and for anyone who's had to endure a job like this, it's like a flashback to the worst time in your life. One feels, and is intended to feel, that what these men do is a sad, sick, empty way to make a living. But it's also rewarding to watch these great actors giving bravura performances and delivering such unforgettable lines. 'Glengarry Glen Ross' is a film you'll not soon forget.

However, with a couple friends over and a little Mystery Science Theater 3000 atmosphere, I threw all those rules out the window and experienced the last hour or so of the cult classic Bloodsport. Did I watch it as a piece of art? Not really. It was more the spectacle of cheesy 80's aesthetic and campy acting\/dialogue that kept me from turning the channel. Was the first hour something important? Who knows, and who cares. I got the gist of what was occurring and from fight to fight knew who the hero and villain were and found myself needing nothing more.I love the tagline for the film&#151;The secret contest where the world's greatest warriors fight in a battle to the death. How misleading is that statement? The connotations to Mortal Kombat are unavoidable&#151;with rumor being that Johnny Cage is mirrored off our lead character Frank Dux&#151;but to the death is a bit of a stretch. One fighter dies in this film, ONE. When he is murdered, the judges and crowd turn their backs on the killer, unable to condone the brutality. I want to know who marketed this and give them a high-five for skewing the truth to sell some seats. The movie could never be a to-the-death fight and work. Not only would we lose all respect for our hero, but also he would never be able to take a life as shown on screen. The tournament would have been shut down too, with American military cops showing up, people everywhere knowing about the event, and reporters going undercover for a story. If death was prevalent, not even the Triads could keep it up.The beauty of the film, though, is in its soundtrack. Synthesizers and falsettos abound transporting you back in time to bad acting, teased hair, and crazy characters. Every second is chock full of unintentional comedy and my friends and I had a blast with it. Jean-Claude Van Damme made a name for himself off this film, and he does not disappoint. Deserting his army post in order to go to Hong Kong to fight and avenge his master's death, this American fighter has the thickest Belgian accent possible. Maybe they explain that he was naturalized as a US citizen in the time I missed, but either way I guess it doesn't quite matter in the grand scope of things. You cannot get enough of his slow-mo shaking body and wide eyed defiance on the battle mat nor the hammy looks of fear once his adversary Chong Li gets embedded in his head to the point he even manifests him on the bus. His romantic involvement with a reporter is also laughable. There is no chemistry between them at all&#151;I think there might be more between he and friend Ray Jackson played brilliantly by Donald Gibb&#151;and the relationship culminates in a horribly orchestrated scene of them bowing to each other hand over fist. At least it is an ending to put a smile on your face, not from contentment, but from sheer absurdity that you stuck with the story its conclusion.In the end, however, you have to see the film for one performance only, Forest Whitaker as the army cop. No, just joking, what the hell was he thinking doing this film? The real reason is Bolo Yeung as Chong Li. This guy is the epitome of evil. The guy is massive and his menacing stare down is so scary you have to laugh from fear or else you may soil yourself. His silent screams and excitement are so unnecessary and out-of-place that they actually work. This guy doesn't need to scream or yell.

You cannot get enough of his slow-mo shaking body and wide eyed defiance on the battle mat nor the hammy looks of fear once his adversary Chong Li gets embedded in his head to the point he even manifests him on the bus. His romantic involvement with a reporter is also laughable. There is no chemistry between them at all&#151;I think there might be more between he and friend Ray Jackson played brilliantly by Donald Gibb&#151;and the relationship culminates in a horribly orchestrated scene of them bowing to each other hand over fist. At least it is an ending to put a smile on your face, not from contentment, but from sheer absurdity that you stuck with the story its conclusion.In the end, however, you have to see the film for one performance only, Forest Whitaker as the army cop. No, just joking, what the hell was he thinking doing this film? The real reason is Bolo Yeung as Chong Li. This guy is the epitome of evil. The guy is massive and his menacing stare down is so scary you have to laugh from fear or else you may soil yourself. His silent screams and excitement are so unnecessary and out-of-place that they actually work. This guy doesn't need to scream or yell. You actually start thinking he may be a mute until he finally tells Van Damme he is going to kill him before the final fight.Is Bloodsport quality cinema? Is it even nostalgically worth seeing as a piece of art? The answer is no on both counts. Would I stop flipping channels and watch it next time its on TV? Definitely. As a comedy, the film is wonderful. I can't even say the fighting is spectacular because it is always subverted by laughs. Between the guy acting like a monkey and the Sumo hugging people into submission, every single second is priceless and unforgettable.

It's almost 3 hours long, but that doesn't take a thing away from it. It's an interesting plot - death falling in love with a human being. Of course they had to get Brad Pitt to play that one thing that we humans will never escape. If they Danny Bonaduce play the lead part, it wouldn't have been such a winner, IMHO. Claire Forlani, who plays Susan Parrish, has the most beautiful pair of eyes in moviedom! I am awestruck by them, and can't get enough seeing her in movies so i can get another view of them. The rest of her is very beautiful, too. Anthony Hopkins (Bill Parrish) gave a great performance in this role of the communications tycoon who gets a few last days to enjoy himself on earth. It's a pretty good flick, with some funny parts mixed in. One of the oddball parts of the movie is Death's love for peanut butter. Certain scenes show him with a spoon sticking out of his mouth.There is one part of the movie which confused me from the get go. Death inherited the body of Pitt's initial character, who is a patron of a coffee shop. After that character met Susan Parrish, and the two hit it off immediately, he gets flustered enough by her beautiful eyes and body to be stopped in the middle of the street, looking at her as she leaves the scene. Well, who hasn't been in that situation, your eyes and ears not paying attention to your surroundings because of a beautiful person who happened to catch your eye, and before you know it, you walk into something, or someone. Well, in this case, a car slams into the guy, killing him. Death inherits his body, and that's how he got around in the movie. Well, at the end of the movie, the person from the accident scene returns from the dead. He is seen talking to Susan, and seems confused how he had gotten where they were. I am just wondering why the director threw that part in there. Why did they choose to bring back a character from the dead? So we romantics would get teary-eyed, knowing that those two characters would be together again? OR, maybe that Death may let some of us escape, just when it seems as though our goose is cooked? It was interesting that they chose that ending, to say the least. Anyway, this movie is highly recommended!

I tried again four years older and it won me over. Personal tastes vary not only between people but within people over time. Nowadays I can't understand why some people can't understand it and get nothing from this timeless world classic - at the very least they could look upon it as the closest the French cinema ever got to Dickens.Meandering tale set in 1840's France has whimsically smiling Garance played by Arletty in love with mime artist Baptiste played perfectly by Jean-Louis Barrault but with three other men in love with her too. These are the Dramatic Actor Lemaitre played by Pierre Brasseur (Lucien from Le Quai Des Brumes), the cynically corrupt Lacenaire by Marcel Herrond (Renaud from Les Visiteurs Du Soir) and stiffly possessive Montray by Louis Salou. With Maria Casares as the faithful Nathalie the trouper in love with Baptiste and you have the main cast for your delectation. Just as the characters in the plays at the Funambules depended upon the pleasure of the audience up in the Gods so do the actors on the screen &#x96; although now thanks to TV and DVD us people up in the Gods are a lot more distant! The main thread is how and why all the tangled love affairs unravel. The film is littered with eccentric characters and heavy poetic observations, backed up with a logical plot, incredible sets and unforgettable acting &#x96; all made under the Nazi occupation. Adversity often heightens the senses, but Carne and Prevert excelled themselves with this production. Favourite bits Baptiste proving Garrance's innocence of stealing a watch in mime to the assembled crowd; the touchy scenes inside the aptly-named Robin Redbreast pub; Garance and Lemaitre in the deeply shaded box at the Funambules watching Baptiste perform; his calling her beautiful and her response of No, just alive, that's all; Lemaitre revising the play in which he was acting on the stage; his opinion of mulled wine &#x96; Like God slipping down your throat in red velvet breeches; Lacenaire's lacerated opinion of everything &#x96; especially of Montray; the bookend bustling street scenes at the start and finish; the astounding ending; and on and on &#x96; so much richness to see and hear in three hours!It's a world portrayed in great detail and lovingly, done in the best French tradition dreamy, full of poetry, a frisson of sex and a little violence.

I've seen this in Queen of the Damned (which sucked anyway), The Skeleton Key, and sooo many others. First of all, there really aren't many Cajuns left in Louisiana, and the ones that were actually brought up around the language causing them to have a Cajun accent are not in New Orleans. Of course there's exceptions. If these directors would actually spend time around the natives of the city they're filming in, they would notice that no one talks like the characters in their movies! I mean, come on, the mayor of New Orleans in Dracula 2000 is white and has a country accent! I'm not expecting directors to get the actors to speak in the exact accent that New Orleanians speak in, but at least stop making them speak like they're from Georgia or Tennessee!!

This two disc set comes with both the original B&W edition and a newly colorized version on a separate disc. This is not the first colorization job on this film. Turner attempted it some years back and both James Stewart and director Frank Capra were appalled at the results. They did everything in their power to discourage this practice. Well the technique for colorization has greatly improved since those early attempts and I thought it worth taking another look at the results. It is quite amazing -- yet after watching it for about one hour I changed to the black & white version and have NO desire to watch it in color. Flesh colors are on the orange side and everyone has the exact same tone of color. The beautiful shades found in the b&w version are far more effective. Let's face it -- if a film was originally designed and shot in color then it should be seen that way. It's the same with watching a wide screen film in full screen or a full screen blown up to fill a 169 wide screen television set. The film itself remains one of my all time favorites -- and I will continue appreciate it in black and white!

I thought Tsui Hark was selling out to Hollywood, and getting unnecessarily flashy in doing so.Seeing it again some ten years later, I have to admit I'm impressed. It's not just the story or the action scenes, or the integration of humor into the thriller storyline. But what once looked like flashiness now reveals itself as careful restraint. Tsui is working hard here to avoid any unnecessary frame, creating a film that admittedly jars visually, but does so tightly, with almost no excess imagery or story element. The film still looks fresh after a decade; while not great art, it's just supremely professional movie making. And in keeping with that, Tsui also manages to get restrained performance by two slices of Hollywood ham, Van Damme and Rob Schneider, the latter being one of the least tolerable comic actor I've ever had the misfortune to encounter on film. But here he seems almost at home in a Hitchcockian spy thriller with Jackie Chan flavored sense of humor - exactly where you would least expect to find him.Over all, although only a B-movie thriller, remains a neat accomplishment for Tsui Hark.

Diva is needlessly complex and meandering in a sloppy, undisciplined way. The plot makes no sense whatsoever and you won't be curious enough to sort it out afterwords, only wondering why you wasted the time.1981. Dynasty was hot. Rubiks Cube hit the market. Juice Newton was cool, so were Kool and the Gang and Eddit Rabbit. But for intellectuals--people who go to films, not movies--it was Diva that had everybody in the chattering classes chattering. While many reviewers talk about the films stylishness, they neglect to add that most of what passes for stylish in any particular moment ends up looking silly and dated very quickly. This is proof. Unfortunately, there is a great concept trapped inside--a passionate and quirky young opera lover who lugs along and manages to surreptitiously tape a beautiful opera recital using a semi-portable top-of-the-line old Nagra (the best tech available in its day.) But that's all lost in the mish-mash of global prostitution ring, silly sunglass wearing bad guys with bad bad guy dialog (I've got a bad feeling about this) and endless shots of a profound wave machine from Sharper Image or somewhere which is the meditation device for a character who is utterly incomprehensible.Don't say you weren't warned.
