Judging from the slew of 10's, this movie has endeared itself to a great many viewers, but for me it was a misfired dark 'comedy' mired in quirky forced situations and unrealistic characters and dialogue. I was particularly annoyed at how Max's character was written and executed. He was painfully irritating, and the contrived love situation did nothing except throw in a convenient plot point for dramatic effect. Bill Murray is competent, but could not save the film.

The plot is as thin as paper, and for a dramatic murder mystery it's not all that dramatic. If it takes over an hour for the plot of a movie to begin there's got to be something wrongSome one told me it was good, and then I decided to watch it. BIG mistake. After the movie was over, I wanted to go to bed ( it was about 7 o'clock) and sleep until noon so that my eyes could heal from this wretched, drawn on, waiting-for-the-story-to-begin movie. For the first hour and a half, I was beginning to wonder whether the plot was going to actually go anywhere. Murder mystery? Yeah, right. Avoid this misleading movie; its not good.

His other films pale by comparison. The combination of Chris' physical antics and David Spade's deadpan straight-man act are perfect. (I mean, like, do you remember the puppet show scene with the toy cars? ... yeah, that was cool.) Anyway, the supporting performances of Brian Dennehy, Rob Lowe, and Bo Derek are strong without taking over the show. And the appearance of Dan Ackroyd as Mr. Zalinski is priceless; he has some of the best lines in the film. The screenplay is strong and never loses pace. Unlike most of Farley's other films, there are no pregnant pauses in the momentum and the movie never stops to be preachy. The tempo of the film has motion without being manic like Black Sheep (an awful film by comparison) and it doesn't get bogged down with needless story points like Beverly Hills Ninja. There's a touching scene at the end with Farley on his boat talking to his deceased father. But even that's okay since it fits nicely as an epilogue.If you don't see another movie on DVD this summer, then you should get out more. In any case, pick up TOMMY BOY, it's more than worth the price of a rental and, in my opinion, well worth buying. Highly recommended.
