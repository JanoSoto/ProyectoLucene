I think the lighting effects and even the technical effects caught me off guard and allowed me to get sucked in. The lighting techniques that the director used were great, they weren't all the same and they allowed the viewers to give a better understanding of what we were suppose to be feeling. I think that the lighting with Frankenstein in the cellar was very bright on his face and really black background, using low key lighting. The low key lighting added to the emotions and the feelings, it shows Frankenstein as this creepy and scary man. The compositions of the scenes were also great, it showed a lot, but it wasn't were it was too much for the viewer. The settings add to the genre of the movie, that creepy and scary type of feeling. Such as the beginning scene where they're at the cementary at a very late time of night, showing black skys and brightened tombstones. As the men are walking with the fire on sticks in their hands the perspective and angle is switched from more of a wide angle shot showing all of the people to just showing one particular person. They try not to get caught up in one angle or perspective, switching up the scenes by showing lower angles or more complex angles. The scene where Frankenstein is peaking in on the little girl playing, showing him as he is like an Innocent child which is the the complete opposite way that he was made to look like. If they spent more time working on him then he would have not caused so much trouble, he did not know any better. The camera angle is switched as the man is walking with his dead daughter, it shows him carrying her across town as people stare at her in disbelief and some what of a shock. The camera is in front of them as the scene starts, but then moves to showing each side of them, showing the people he is walking by.

My problem with this movie is that it failed to be compelling and the story seemed rushed. The movie is very dreary and depressing, it plods along, the story lacks any real depth, there's no outstanding part in the film that makes you sit up and take notice. They infamous sex scene made the film no better and felt un-justified especially the long length of time it was on, a talented actress like Halle Berry lowering herself to do something like that made me cringe in all honesty.

The charming boyfriend who turns out to be a controlling, violent, psychopathic, obsessive guy who can't let go of the girl he's fallen in love with in spite of the fact that neither she nor her family want him around anymore. I can't say that struck me as particularly creative, nor did I find the bulk of the story especially interesting. It does, however, have some things going for it.First, I have to give credit to Drew Barrymore and Mark Wahlberg. Setting aside the fact that both were a little older than the characters they were playing, they were quite good in their roles as the young & naive Nicole and the charming psychopath David who sweeps her off her feet. Both were in the very early stages of their respective acting careers, but the lack of experience didn't show. They were convincing. The rest of the cast didn't really measure up to their standards, but the characters were interesting enough. I could certainly relate to William Petersen as Nicole's dad as he gets more and more concerned about this relationship his daughter is having, even though for some reason Petersen didn't really strike home with me in the role. And I have to say that although the movie almost lost me with the silly scene where David tattoos Nicole 4 Eva on his own chest, and while most of the story really didn't make that much of a connection with me, the last 20 minutes or so turns out to be a pretty good ride. It also is pretty standard for this kind of movie - as Nicole's entire family ends up doing battle with David and the bad guys, etc., etc., but it was very well done and exciting.This isn't a bad movie.

He makes sure you know that only the lower classes fought, that any given platoon was filled with murderous sadists, that everyone smoked weed and drank, and that almost no one believed in the cause, except the one evil guy. Also remember that this is a movie starring Charlie Sheen, narrating what it's like to be in the jungles of Vietnam. Does that remind you of something? Yes, his dad already did that in Apocalypse Now, 7 years earlier. So that draws away from the originality of this one. But I did like the central conflict of a nice Sergeant versus a barbaric, yet effective one. Both were brave and effective soldiers, employing very different tactics. Before I get to the repeated sadism, let me remind everyone that the war was not just about some lower class American guys shooting up some local Asian peasants in funny hats. America was fighting the superpowers of China and the U.S.S.R., who were backing the North Vietnamese, and who had designs on world domination. Also remember that Communism murdered millions upon millions of people, including Cambodians, once the Americans went home. I think the movie did do a decent job of showing you the dialog and daily mannerisms of low class men, when left alone. In most cases, whomever you were back home, will still be with you in the jungle. If you were the type of guy who shirked responsibility or blamed others for your mistakes, or you were self-indulgent, or lazy, etc., you will be that at war too. Interestingly there is only one Christian depicted, and that is a quiet Hispanic Catholic soldier who never speaks. I would think that in real life, even many uneducated, small town soldiers would still be Christians. The two Sergeants were too old to be draftees. So they were career military. But they act like common soldiers. Even though Sergeants are not officially Officers, a career soldier might be more conservative that the way these guys were portrayed. I'll grant the fact that Stone was apparently a soldier there himself, and I was not. I don't doubt that some of the clichés you see in these movies are true. But they just tend to be one-sided. Tom Berenger was excellent, as was Willem Dafoe. Despite what a weird guy Sheen wound up becoming in real life, I have to say that I like him in those 80s movies. There was something very natural about his acting. I don't think Johnny Depp even spoke in this one, and Kevin Dillon played the same kind of guy he would wind up playing for the next quarter century. The gung-ho dumb-dumb. Music was not employed with the same degree of effectiveness in this one, as it was in Apocalypse Now. Too violent for me, but I did like the way the picture showed the daily frustrations of lack of sleep, leeches, personality conflicts, and fear.

Probably not but if you took anything out of the picture it simply wouldn't have that epic feel. Today movies are long for no reason what so ever whereas in the past and with films like this they were long for a purpose. The film is pretty much flawless but I think the greatest thing it does is the visual scale of everything. Those opening shots of the desert are just marvelous to see on a large screen and those beautiful shots of the sun rising and falling. The entire scope of the sand, the mountains and the eventual battles are just something truly marvelous to behold. It's also important that the story itself didn't get lost in this massive production and Lean really does a remarkable job at telling the story and especially during the second half when the film really does focus on Lawrence and his downfall.

And while it may not have been the first zombie movie ever created, it set the rules and the standard for which all other zombie films are judged. Now, that is not to say that there aren't good zombie movies out there. But this is the film that essentially started the modern zombie genre. It's as simple as that. Filmed in 1968 on a budget of only $114,000 it has made over $30 million. It was also selected in 1999 to the National Film Registry. Not bad for such a low-budget movie. And because it was so low-budget, the director (George A. Romero) had to be extremely creative. So he filmed in black and white, enlisted ordinary people dressed in clothes from Goodwill and even used chocolate syrup to simulate blood. And it worked! He also used unknown actors like Duane Jones (Ben) and Judith O'Dea (Barbra) to play the lead roles. And they turned in the performances of their careers. Again, there are plenty of good zombie movies which have been made since this one. There are also plenty of very bad zombies movies made since this one too. But if you're looking for one that is extraordinary then you need look no further than this particular film. On that note, because of an error when they initially registered it, you can probably view it for free over the internet as it is in the public domain.

But he did.But in both films, we see the same powerful strategy a complex, philosophical brain-twister beneath a deceptivly simple exterior. Fiddler on the Roof was seemingly a linear story about a struggling Jewish family's good & bad times. But the real meat of the story was about the conflict between old ways and new (tradition vs. progress). Here in Rollerball we have another seemingly linear story about an athlete in a violent, futuristic sport. But the real meat is the conflict of brutal human nature vs. suppression (again, a sort of tradition vs. progress). As with Fiddler on the Roof, director Norm Jewison doesn't hit us over the head with any preachy sermon but instead leaves us to digest the situation.Rollerball has the same powerful, brooding quality that we see in many of the 70s scifi masterpieces, like THX 1138, Soylent Green, Planet of the Apes, Blade Runner (yeah I know that one was 1982), and the one that started them all, 2001 A Space Odyssey. Cold, sterile sets, disturbing situations and powerful use of silence characterize these films. By today's standards they might be considered slow, but depending on how you like your scifi, that might be right up your alley.In a nutshell, the story is about a futuristic society that has largely done away with civilian violence. It has done this by subsidizing violence by way of a global pasttime a hyper-violent sport called Rollerball. Note as a parallel story, we learn that cut-throat corporate competition has been similarly squelched by the government creating monopolies. And thus society finds peace. Or does it? You can probably see the brilliant metaphors being woven here. This isn't an ordinary scifi romp, it's a powerful socio-political allegory. It cuts to the heart of human nature the way the great writers H.G. Welles, Mary Shelley and George Orwell did. No, you won't see a lot of laser battles, spaceships and aliens. But here you'll see an excellent example of what scifi was designed to do comment on our current human condition by creating a fictional (extreme) scenario as a cautionary tale.Excellent, and I mean EXCELLENT performances by James Caan (The Godfather, Misery), John Houseman (The Paper Chase, The Fog), Maud Adams (3 James Bond films), Moses Gunn (every 70s TV show from Hawaii 5-O to Shaft), and a particularly gripping performance by Pamela Hensley (Princess Ardala in Buck Rogers homina homina) make this an all-star powerhouse of 70s talent.The music deserves a special mention of its own. From the opening notes of Bach's Toccata in Dm (the creepy Dracula theme) to Albinoni's haunting Adagio in Gm (check it out on YouTube... saddest song ever), Rollerball doesn't hold back.They don't make 'em like this anymore. But there are a few modern scifi films that come close Moon, District 9 and Solaris come to mind.If you liked the films I mentioned in this review; if you liked the 70s classics Catch-22 and Coma and Stepford Wives; if you like films that are both entertaining and works of art, do NOT miss Rollerball.For laughs, after you watch Rollerball (1976), check out the remake done in 2002 ...and see how far we've come \/ ","genre":null},{"date":"4 October 2012","score":"8 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" At first glance you'd never guess the same director who did the wonderfully charming Fiddler on the Roof would turn around 2 years later and do the dark, dystopian chiller Rollerball.

When I went swimming, I pretend to be Ariel and sing Part of Your World with my horrendous singing voice (yes, my singing voice is very off key, monotone, or too pitchy). But I did it so YOSO (you only swim once). Ariel (Jodi Benson) has a voice like an angel and Ariel is my favorite princess EVER- she may be stubborn and spoiled, but she's determined, curious, and adventurous! I Love Ariel; she's just like me in some ways (I wanted to be a mermaid when I was younger!) So let's get back to the movieThe songs are freakin' awesome! When Sebastian and his animal friends sing Under the Sea, I want to be in the sea singing along and be with my sisters down there. That would be awesome! Poor Unfortunate Souls sung by the fantastic villainess Ursula blew me away! It's just how she presented the song is so memorizing and freaky especially if you are part of that situation. Part of Your World is a showstopper, it's brilliant! All hail Jodi! She should be my singing coach if I had all of the money in the world. Kiss the Girl is cute, not as strong as the other 3, but I'll take it. The songs are some of the best that Disney has ever done, nuff said.The Little Mermaid has great and lively animation, Ursula is one of Disney's best villains (she and Scar from TLK are my favorite Disney villains of all time!!!!), Flounder is the cutest fish ever, it has a great plot, plus Jodi Benson as Ariel! How awesome is that?I wish I could give this an 11\/10 because this movie deserves that 11\/10! Watch The Little Mermaid, it won't disappoint!

This doesn't make it like any other zombie film. In fact this is the powerhouse of a splatter! As a gatekeeper of the cinema hall, I request all the haters of gore go home and welcome all those who love the twisted tale of splatter and walking innards that set history in the world of splatter. People had seen gore before 'Braindead' was released, but what sets this one apart from the other gore films is that 'Braindead' falls into the 'comedy horror' genre. Since it's no disturbing stuff, the lovers of splatter may revel this twisted tale for years together.The film begins with the scene of Skull Island, where we come across a New Zealand zoo-officer (Bill Ralston) who has dared catch a Sumatran Monkey with the help of local guides and poachers. The spear-wielding tribal inhabitants show unwelcoming attitude towards the intruders and follow them. Fortunately they happen to take the monkey along, but the zoo-officer gets bitten. The poachers lose no time in decapitating and beheading the helpless zoo-officer for his sole good, for they fear that the monkey's bite would transform him into something bizarre! The monkey reaches Wellington and is kept in a zoo.Cut to Wellington, we meet a young man Lionel Cosgrove (Timothy Balme), who lives with his over-possessive, domineering, and snobbish mother Vera (Elizabeth Moody). Vera loves making Lionel work for hours together and keeps him engaged in several odd jobs. It so happens that Lionel begins his first affair with a dashing Spanish belle Paquita (Diana Peñalver) and the two decide to visit a local zoo. Vera is suspicious about Lionel's objectives and follows them. Unfortunately, Vera gets bitten by the same Sumatran Monkey and Lionel somehow brings her home.Vera objects to this relationship calling Lionel irresponsible and unapologetic. The next day the bite begins showing its effect and Vera dies. Moments later we see Vera's corpse animating back to life, but this time she has become more like a rotting corpse or more precisely a zombie. Lionel somehow believes that his mother could be cured and does everything to keep her alive. The townspeople believe that Vera has died and gather at her funeral. That night Lionel visits her grave and exhumes Vera's corpse. He is hampered by a pack of hooligans who think he is a body snatcher and beat him mercilessly. Vera's corpse comes out of the grave and infects the hooligans and a priest Father McGruder (Stuart Devenie). In order to hide his mother's tale, Lionel has to make arrangements for all the zombies at the basement of his palatial house, he has inherited from his family. But his uncle Les (Ian Watkin) has his own plans about this inheritance. How Paquita and Lionel try to reunite against all the odds and fight away a pack of several hundred zombies forms the crux of the story.'Braindead' is a perfect splatter entertainer in all sense. The film captures some of the more bizarre and disgorging images that may leave the viewers in discomfort. I think they spent most of the budget on fake blood because gore and splatter are the ingredients that set the viewers' mood. Also, it has some of the wittiest dialogs I've ever enjoyed listening to. I remember I liked Tom Holland's 'Fright Night' for its witty dialogs and its credibility as a next door tale. 'Braindead' too is close to any other credible next door tale, except that Lionel's house is the home of raging and murderous zombies. Now there are zombies of all age and sizes and Lionel's interaction with them is more of a spectacle. The scene where Lionel deals with the zombie baby is ludicrous and a great stress buster. People may berate this one for its offensive imagery, I still say that gore hounds and the admirers of bizarre and twisted have an ample scope to quench their thirst!

Basically dying General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) in Los Angeles hires private-eye detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) to supposedly keep an eye on his daughter Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers) who owes many gambling debts to bookseller Arthur Gwynn Geiger (Theodore Von Eltz), but it may in fact be his older daughter Vivian (Lauren Bacall) that needs his help. Marlowe goes to find the bookseller, the shop being looked after by assistant Agnes Louzier (Sonia Darrin), and when he tries to talk to Geiger he finds his body instead, along with a drugged Carmen, and later when he returns the body disappears, and the Sternwood driver is found dead too. Vivian comes to see Marlowe with some blackmail type pictures of Carmen, so he goes back to the bookseller's shop and follows a car to the apartment Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), a gambler who has blackmailed the General, and after returning to talk to Carmen she at first denies any knowledge of the Geiger's murder, but then names Brody as the killer. After an encounter with small-time gangster Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), Marlowe, Vivian and Carmen go to see Brody, with Agnes there too, to get the photos back, but an assailant shoots Brody dead, but the shooter, Geiger's former driver Carol Lundgren (Tommy Rafferty) who killed for revenge. Marlowe needs answers from Mars, and after some stooge work and pressing there is some kind of robbery plot revealed, and Carmen reveals that Mars calls Vivian frequently, and then she tries to seduce him but he refuses to give in to it. There is some kind of murder plot by Harry Jones (Elisha Cook Jr.), hired killer Lash Canino (Bob Steele) is sent to kill Agnes or whatever but Marlowe kills him first, and after some more gossip and revelations a meeting is arranged with Mars at Geiger's place. Guns are pulled out as Mars reveals he blackmailed Vivian to claim a crime of murder, in the chase Mars ends up shot accidentally by his own men, Marlowe calls the police and says that the real murder culprit was the gangster, and he assures Vivian that Carmen will get a doctor's help. Also starring Dorothy Malone as Acme Book Shop, Peggy Knudsen as Mona Mars, Regis Toomey as Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls and Charles D. Brown as Norris the Butler. I will absolutely honest and say that I hardly followed any real plot at all, it was pretty complicated, a review even says that it is complex for most people, for the witty script and the performances by real lovers and to-be husband and wife Bogie and Bacall it is a worthwhile classic detective drama.

Basically dying General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) in Los Angeles hires private-eye detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) to supposedly keep an eye on his daughter Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers) who owes many gambling debts to bookseller Arthur Gwynn Geiger (Theodore Von Eltz), but it may in fact be his older daughter Vivian (Lauren Bacall) that needs his help.
