Twin Town is basically a sequence of revenge acts between two groups of people linked in all sorts of ways. The Twins to whom the title refers might as well be cardboard cutouts, for the lack of personalities, but you find yourself sympathetic with them despite their debauchery. Likewise the death of the Lewis family (minus the sons) is a very sad moment, despite the fact that they have been portrayed so shallowly. This is the success of the film, the way it manipulates your emotions to leave you genuinely shaken by the violence in the events leading up to the climax, whereas the opening of the film leads you to expect a light-hearted farce. Watching it again it is easy to divide the film into two sections, but very difficult to pin down where the change of pace and mood begins. The humour and irony is superb, particularly the razor sharp sarcasm of Adie. Although a very seedy picture of Wales is presented, this presents a very positive view of the people of Swansea and manages not to be anti-English in the slightest despite the obvious nationalistic feel. The acting is great, and as long as you aren`t expecting anything like Trainspotting and you let the humour wash over you you`ll enjoy this.

Viewers are now into the film and perhaps the whole viewing experience could be saved. Nope, the film ends on a pointless gun shootout that comes from out of nowhere, serving no purpose and leaving the viewer completely unsatisfied. Perhaps the only good thing about the sudden ending of this film was in the early ending itself.I found all performances in this film to be below average with the exception of Ray Liotta, who at least gives an honest days work. Stallone, Keitel, DeNero, Patrick and Garofalo all give sleepy performances which is most unusual for them. I can only be led to think that each cared so little about this film and it clearly showed.I would not recommend this film to anyone unless you really have time to waste.4\/10 stars.

It must be noticed during these years of intellectual poorness in american movies. It's not to say that there have been no clever movies but the most noticed movies were not. In France we keep overall movies like Rocky IV or Rambo where the hero is the stronger, he never dies and saves the world (what could we do without Americans ?). The point of view of Carpenter is very courageous, he shows what consumption society makes (consume, obey) and has that few people awares of it. It was an era where money and economical liberalism were ruling human relationship. Carpenter couldn't stand this and showed it by the way of the seventh art. That's what movies should be made for  engagement in the author's mind by the work. There are not a lot of movies today having surprised the viewer like this, by its cleverness. The last american one is In the company of men by Neil LaBute. There are scenes which will stay in the memory of the person who watches, like the fight. You think it's going to end but it continues, and continues. In a typical movie it ends after one or two minutes, but there, no way. John Carpenter breaks the rules and this nihilism (see the name of the hero  Nada) was not the american way of life. By breaking the rules of movies he broke the rules of american society. There has been two other heroes, created also by Carpenter  Snake Plissken and Jack Crow. They are not perfect, they have weaknesses, they are just humans. They don't really make dream the spectator but they're more similar to him than Armaggedon or Independance day's characters. The perfection is a notion that carpenter doesn't like, in his different movies (village of damned, Vampire$) the heroes lose sometimes, they're not more clever, they get f***** (the motel's scene in Vampire$). They live is a film about the human, the perfection and freedom. Carpenter broke rules of American society (and way of making films)in order to promode a typical American value  the freedom. Carpenter was free when he made this movie.

I feel it is unfair to compare the two movies, both are about the second World War that is about the only connection they share.  Besides Ryan's horrific first 20 minutes (a brutal and realistic recreation of D-Day), Ryan was more of a conventional film with the set storyline (find a missing soldier).  The Thin Red Line has it's battle scenes (the whole middle), but goes more for imagery and symbolism.  There is no set story line just a team of soldiers you follow around.  If you have looked at the papers or seen the previews for The Thin Red Line you have probably been amazed at the cast it has. This is misleading since only two of the big names have big roles, Sean Penn (Dead Man Walking, At Close Range) and Nick Nolte (Affliction, Blue Chips). Although these two have big roles, the main two roles are given to newcomers Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin.  Both are superb, Caviezel playing a soldier who has gone AWOl a couple of times, but seems to have something special about him and Chaplin as a soldier who has an incredible devotion to his wife back home.  Penn plays a tough soldier who seems to like Caviezel despite his tough attitude toward him.  Penn is one of the best actors in Hollywood and continues that with another strong performance.  Nolte is extremely good as a Patton-type leader who wants his military glory no matter the cost.  John Travolta (Get Shorty, Pulp Fiction) and George Clooney (Out of Sight, One Fine Day) both appear briefly (less than a minute each) and leave no effect, except for the poor timing of Clooney's cameo. Woody Harrelson (The Cowboy Way, Indecent Proposal) has a slightly bigger part as one of the leaders during a battle and has a fairly powerful scene. John Cusack also has a small role, but plsys it perfectly.  Also, Elias Koteas (Fallen, The Prophecy) beautifully plays the role of a leader who has to make a difficult decision during the battle.  John C. Reilly (The River Wild, Out on a Limb) and Adrien Brody (Solo, Angels in the Outfield) are in the whole movie but have little to do, but do it well.

The film really is about nothing, yet succeeds in being one of the greatest films of all time. The acting is superb, plot is very original and of course Hitchcock's direction brings the ordinary to extraordinary.The film revolves around the theme of privacy or otherwise the lack of it. Jimmy Stewart plays Jeff, a photographer who is confined to his home and his wheelchair after an accident. With nothing to do, he spends his days watching the antics of his neighbours through the rear window of his apartment. Other than daily visits from a nurse (Thelma Ritter)and periodic visits from his girlfriend (Grace Kelly), he basically eats, sleeps and watches the every action of his neighbours.The story takes an interesting twist when Jeff figures that one of the neighbours he has been wacthing has killed his wife. Jeff brings this up with his girlfriend, nurse and an old wartime pal who is now a detective. At first, each of them have their doubts about Jeff's beliefs, however, it is only a matter of time until each of them are drawn into the situation as well. The last half hour of this film is done perfectly; incredibly suspenseful and yet not overpowering or unbelievable.Grace Kelly's performance in this film is probably her best. The introduction of her into this film is remarkable and probably the object of many mens' fantasies. She maintains a level of being something more than just Jeff's girlfriend throughout the film and has incredible chemistry with Stewart, something that isn't seen in most other films. Thelma Ritter plays well in a slightly comical role as the nurse who stays true to Jeff even though he is a man that she hardly even knows. Orson Wells has such a minor role in this film and spends 95% of his screen time being watched, not heard. However, in his confrontation, he strikes fear in the viewer without even being heard before the scene.This film is on my top ten list and deserves more exposure than other more popular Hitchcock films (Vertigo, North by Northwest, Psycho).

It suffers badly as it is now completely outdated with its blackmail and adultery premise. Even Montgomery Clift as a stoic priest is outdated.  In our age of Law and Order and Matlock, we all know that priests can't talk.
