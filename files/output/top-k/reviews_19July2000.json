In fact I know a chubby, crude-talking Native American girl who said that one of her relatives was in the movie.  I guess it could be possible.  It really had some emotional moments such as the scenes where the soldiers were shooting at the wolf who came to Dunbar's fort often (thus this is how he got the Indian name, Dances With Wolves) and where they were attacking the Sioux.  What's interesting to note is that my mom pointed out that normally in movies, the Indians are portrayed as being the bad guy and they never showed any positive characteristics about them, whereas in this movie, the white people are portrayed as the bad guys (except for John Dunbar) which in a way was true.

In fact, I wasn't sure and didn't really care either way as to whether it was good or bad; it just looked fun.  I've never been a huge X-Men fan, but I'm familiar with most of the characters and major plot points since I used to read American Comics a while back.  With most comic book movies being really bad, I didn't have very high expectations for X-Men.  I'm glad I didn't.  Otherwise I might have been disappointed.As far as just being a ton of fun to watch, X-Men doesn't disappoint. There's some great visuals and direction, and then there's also some cheesy stuff.  I supposed I'll talk about visuals first.  The special fx weren't too bad, but it looked like they needed a higher budget.  Some of them were really cool.  The wind effects of Storm and Cyclops's optic blast were cool, as well as some of the other mutant power stuff. I was skeptical of Mystique's look at first, but I found that I really liked it in the movie. But any scene with characters flying just looked cheesy and rigged, and the statue of liberty fight scene was just...weird.  The slo mo just didn't work in that context.As far as the characters go, the ones that were focused on were in character and looked pretty good.  Wolverine was great, and I ended up liking him more than I ever did in the comics for some reason.  Cyclops was the dork that he is, and of course Professor X and Magneto were well done.  Rogue was ok, despite the fact that she was much younger than X-Men fans are used to.  But Storm just....did nothing.  She looked scared most of the movie, and she was way too much of a background character. (Although if they had concentrated too much on every character it would have been too loaded with complicated details and would clutter the story.) And she had the worst line of dialogue I've ever heard, which many people have already complained about.  That line was trying so hard to be cool that it just came out all wrong.  Sabertooth was pretty bad as well.  I'd have to say he was the worst.  I hated the lion roars and the fact that he barely spoke.  He wasn't all that savage either, and the whole Wolverine\/Sabertooth rivalry thing was ignored in the movie. I realize that the movie was made for the masses and not just for X-Men and comic book fans, so they did a commendable job translating it even if it's missing details.Oh, the soundtrack was just bad.There's not much more I can think to say about this movie.  It was good for a comic book live action movie.  I still think the best medium for comic book movies would be animation, since the characters are drawn characters to begin with, but unfortunately mature cartoons don't go over too well in this country.

It was the first time a entertaining movie about teenagers being frightened by a killer actually gained the critics applause. Bravo!!!

AIDS, cancer, tuberculosis...  However, a very underrated and, in my opinion, deadly disease we seem to forget is alcoholism.  Being an alcoholic is like being drug-addicted.  You may think it is easy to quit drinking but it is as hard as dropping drugs and once you've stopped taking alcohol, you can't ever have any again or you'll simply go back to alcoholism.  This issue is the principle theme of Leaving Las Vegas.  However, in the movie, we see as well how alcohol can grab a person and this person will never want to quit and even less hear people asking him or her to see a doctor to quit drinking.   Prostitution may be considered by many to be something of very low class but for some women, it is the only possibility they have to make some money.  Some prostitutes are independent and others have a pimp.  In Leaving Las Vegas, Elisabeth Shue works for a pimp with whom she has a relationship.   Finally, the last issue in this movie is love.  Love with a prostitute more specifically.  In 1990's Pretty Woman, Julia Roberts refuses to kiss her clients on the lips to avoid making a connection with them.  In this movie, Elisabeth Shue does not even talk about this for she believes to be strong enough to avoid any relationship that a client may be trying to trigger between him and her because of her love affair with her pimp Julian Sands.  These three issues, alcoholism, prostitution, and love with a prostitute are the center themes of Leaving Las Vegas.   The story is simple.  Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) is a script-writer who has hit rock bottom and upon being released from his job decides to go to Las Vegas to drink himself to death.  There, he meets a beautiful young prostitute named Sera (Elisabeth Shue) with whom he spends the night only sleeping.  He turns out to be Sera's only client that night and gives her five hundred dollars for her services.  Her pimp Yuri (Julian Sands) is very mad but finally gets over it.  Later on in the movie, Ben invites Sera to dinner but she refuses knowing that she must work to bring some money back to Yuri.  However, when she goes back to Yuri, he tells her to leave and never come back.  As she exits the hotel room where Yuri was staying she crosses three men going to Yuri's room.  She goes back to Ben's motel-room and they go off to dinner.  After dinner she invites him to live in her house and when he moves in, Ben explains that if Sera is to accept him into her life, she can never ask him to quit drinking.  And so begins the love story between Ben and Sera.  Nicolas Cage walked home with that year's best actor Oscar and he deserved it.  I believe that any alcoholic could associate himself to Ben.  Elisabeth Shue is equally good as Sera, the sensitive but tough prostitute who accepts Ben as he is without judgment or prejudice.  Mike Figgis's direction is exceptional.  The fast-forwarding of the camera when Ben arrives to Las Vegas add to his drunk state of mind.  But it is definitely Cage's movie all the way.  The movie also tries to send a message which I believe is no matter what people look like, allow them to be themselves and do not judge them and that is all that Ben asks from Sera throughout the movie.  There is a scene in a hotel in the desert where Ben and Sera are kissing and Ben is very drunk and as Ben gets up next to the pool, he knocks down a glass table and breaks it.  A little while after, the owner of the hotel comes to help Sera pick up the mess and she tells Sera she wants Ben and her gone by the next morning.  This scene is exactly the representation of what Ben doesn't want from Sera.    This movie may end a bit in the same way a tearjerker but it has nothing to do with that type of movie.

Because some mutants have potentially dangerous powers, a political battle rages over what precautionary steps the government should take to safe guard normal civilians against mutants.The good guys are the X-Men, a team led by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart, famous for his role as Captain Jean Luc Pickard).  Xavier also heads a school where young mutants learn to control their powers.  The film eludes to a long standing friendship between Xavier and Magneto, who are still friends despite their opposing goals.  Magneto believes that the human race should be conquered by the genetically superior mutants.  Xavier believes that the two should work to co-exist peacefully, despite the personal and political bigotry most men show towards mutants.  Unlike many other generic super hero films, X-Men has plenty of content.  There is obviously much more story to tell both in the past and the future, than what has been shown in this film.CHARACTERS The bad guy, Magneto, wishes to destroy the human race.  He is a mutant with the ability to create magnetic fields, and thus has a seemingly telekinetic influence over all metal objects.  Aiding him are henchmen Mystique, Toad, and Sabertooth.  Mystique is a doppelganger played by Rebbecca Romijin-Stamos.  I have to wonder why a super-model was cast into the character whose face and body are never seen, as Mystique frequently shape shifts from her original form, which resembles a blue alien.   Toad is played by Ray Park, famous for his role as Darth Maul.  Disappointingly his role is very small (again), although his incredible martial arts skills stand out in the few moments he has onscreen.  Sabertooth is played by professional wrestler Tyler Mane, whom I am not familiar with yet he plays his simple role of dumb henchmen perfectly.The X-Men include already mentioned Professor Charles Xavier, who can control the minds of others, and is farsighted through clairvoyance.  At his side is apprentice Jean Grey with, among other psychic powers, telekinesis. Jean Grey is the girlfriend of Cyclops, who can shoot laser beams from his eyes.  Cyclops is at ends with Wolverine, who take a liking to his girlfriend.  Wolverine has indestructible claws build into his metal skeleton, and regenerates his wounds faster than most bad guys can dish 'em out.  Rounding out the team is, Halle Berry playing Storm, who can control the weather.  Finally there is Rogue, who has the most crippling and unique power. She can absorb the life force and mutant powers of others by touching them.OVERALL This film of course is based upon the poplar comic book of the same name. Portraying a comic book on film always requires careful direction.  Most comic book characters wear outrageously unrealistic costumes (Spawn), and perform surreal actions nearly impossible to translate into reality on the silver screen.  X-Men however handles these problems perfectly.  Costumes are never over done (characters even joke about this), and superb special effects make the plot progress very fluidly throughout even the most unrealistic comic book scenarios (although I've heard several people claim they could see a string attached to Toad at one point).All things considered this is a good film.  Great casting and action combined with a bold story and top notch special effects all work to bring this film together.  Thumbs up and four stars!

I can only compare it to live-action movies with science fiction themes.The movie is set in a future Hong Kong where cyborgs are common enough that even some of the garbage men have computers linked into their brains. The title refers to the distinction between the ghost, the conscious mind that makes a person human, and the shell, a person's natural or artificial body.At the beginning, the Section 9 internal security agency has its best agents investigating computer crimes linked to the mysterious individual known as the Puppet Master. His (or possibly her) nickname refers to the Puppet Master's criminal specialty, mind-controlling people by way of their own brain-implanted computer links.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Section 6 is also interested in the Puppet Master, who has apparently attempted to manipulate international diplomacy. Sections 6 and 9 soon come into conflict over how to pursue the Puppet Master, although it appears that a hostile internal rivalry already existed between those branches of government.Section 9's top agent, Major Kusanagi is a cyborg who is mostly machine. Her investigative partner is Tosuga, a married man who still has almost all of his natural body. She has doubts about how human she is when she has almost nothing of her natural body left except her brain, and finds a mostly-natural partner reassuring. As she learns more about the Puppet Master, her doubts about her human ghost deepen.The main plots are the pursuit of the Puppet Master, the government in-fighting, and Kusanagi's self-doubt. The interlinked plots are complicated enough to confuse an inattentive viewer. But watching closely, one can see that everything in the movie was leading toward the conclusion, although I could only managed to see that after I had seen the conclusion.The characters all seemed to have motives that rationally explained their actions. In many movies, they would just do whatever the screenwriter needed them to do. The movie was good science fiction, with a lot of mystery and action, and a little politics and philosophy -- not just cyberpunk technobabble. Unlike so much science fiction, worst of all cyberpunk, the story isn't just a carrier for special effects, the story is the soul of the movie.The animation was good, comparable in quality to mid-range Disney, but far short of masterpieces like Mononoke Hime. The artistic design was very good, with lots of depth and atmosphere, in the style of Blade Runner relocated to Hong Kong. The weapons and armed combat showed clear attention to realism. Overall, the movie was very good visually.I watched the movie twice, in part to compare the Japanese and English voices. The Japanese voices were very expressive, although I couldn't understand the dialog without the subtitles. The English voices varied between competent and lackluster. The two versions are somewhat complementary -- the Japanese voices bring much more emotion to the movie, but the English sound track is often clearer on details than the somewhat-condensed English subtitles. Best of all is probably the Japanese sound track, for those who understand Japanese.The music was excellent. The sound effects were very good. The overall sound quality was good on my modest sound system. I don't know how much better it would be in fancy surround sound.Overall, the movie is very good.

That movie was as much a classic as a cult movie as a ground-breaker.  Over the years, we have seen many different versions of this movie, the best one probably being Thelma & Louise (1991).

Probably one of the best living actors in today's movie industry.  His small roles in A Time To Kill (1996) and JFK (1991) are just as mesmerising as his big roles like in The Assignment (1997).  If you were to ask me Who do you think will be the next Donald Sutherland?, I would have to say No one.  But after seeing Truth Or Consequences, N.M., I'd say Kiefer Sutherland could become as great an actor as his father is.    As for a great director, well, that doesn't seem to be a problem in Hollywood right for many young directors are developing themselves into great ones and many of the older great directors are still around and while not necessarily becoming one of the greatest directors in the industry, Kiefer Sutherland seems to have as much of an acting talent as of a directing talent.    The movie's story seems very simple and in a way it is.  A drug deal gone awry leaves about six dead people including five cops and four young people on the run from the law.  But as the movie develops, so does the story.  Hostages, undercover cop, drug lords, pregnancy, the Mob, and life on the road all mix together into this delightful mixture of love and guns.  In 1967's Bonnie & Clyde, Warren Beatty was a criminal at the beginning of the movie and always wanted to rob and unfortunately killed people.  In 1991's Thelma & Louise, the two women had gone on a vacation with no intention to become criminals but unfortunately were dragged into that world by a murder involving a would-be rapist.  In Truth Or Consequences, N.M., only Kiefer Sutherland's character starts off as a crazy maniac with the intention of killing people and this is why this movie differs from the two others.  What lead these people to be criminals is an internal action, an action caused by Kiefer Sutehrland's character, an action that could have been avoided contrarily to those of Bonnie & Clyde and Thelma & Louise.  Equally good in the movie are Vincent Gallo and Mykelti Williamson.  Gallo plays the head of the gang, a man with a conscience who has no desire in killing people and whose only goal is to go down to Mexico with his girlfriend (Kim Dickens)and get married.  Williamson has the hardest role of the movie as an undercover drug enforcement agent and must change the way he acts and talks in presence of Vincent Gallo, Kiefer Sutherland, and Kim Dickens.  The cast also includes two very small roles, one for Rod Steiger and the other for Martin Sheen who are both in top shape.

But if you're leading a life like Isabella Rossellini's in this movie, you must be begging for an ordinary life.  Also, we may talk about having weirder or more exciting events in our lives but when we it comes to movies, the average moviegoer seems to want everything to be plain and simple so that he can understand all that is going on and not have to ask any questions at the end.  Well if you feel you're one of those moviegoers, you won't want to see Blue Velvet.  David Lynch.  He is one of the most underrated directors in Hollywood today and even though I am not fond of all his movies, I have to say he is very talented and seems to have a liking for weirdness.  In fact, his movies are so weird that the only movies that are as weird as one of his are his others.  On IMDb, when we look for a recommendation for another movie in the same style and we're on a movie that Lynch directed, most of the recommendations we'll find will be other David Lynch movies.   The movie's plot revolves around a coincidence.  One day, Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) is walking home from the hospital where his father is and accidentally finds a human ear on the ground.  This ear will allow him to discover many things a bar singer named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) whose husband and son have been kidnapped, a crazy maniac named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) who has apparently captured Dorothy's husband and son, and many other weird adventures that are signed by David Lynch.   The movie is too weird to be explained in less than 1000 words but I can tell you that it is worth watching, primarily for the weirdness.  Yes, it is very weird, sick, gross, and perverted as well, but Lynch seems able to make a good connection between all of these characteristics that the movie has and is able to make this connection rewarding.  He earned himself an Oscar nomination for best director.  Furthermore, Lynch was able to add to the movie a certain visual beauty through the horrors taking place on screen which are pleasing to the viewer. Even if you are in that category of moviegoers that like the movies plain and simple, you should give this one a shot and see that you weren't making a mistake by watching it.

But if you're leading a life like Isabella Rossellini's in this movie, you must be begging for an ordinary life.  Also, we may talk about having weirder or more exciting events in our lives but when we it comes to movies, the average moviegoer seems to want everything to be plain and simple so that he can understand all that is going on and not have to ask any questions at the end.  Well if you feel you're one of those moviegoers, you won't want to see Blue Velvet.  David Lynch.  He is one of the most underrated directors in Hollywood today and even though I am not fond of all his movies, I have to say he is very talented and seems to have a liking for weirdness.

I was expecting it to be great, but it was even greater. With dazzling special effects and a great storyline, this movie is the best of 2000! Hugh Jackman did a great job as playing Wolverine, and Anna Paquin did a pretty good job playing Rouge. Patrick Stewart was great as Professor Charles Xavier, and Halle Berry was unexpectedly (to me, anyways) great as Storm. I have been waiting for this movie for a while. Maybe even over a year. But for the last couple of months, I've been reading magazines with info on the movie, and just sinking my teeth into them. This movie is a must see for all X-Men fans, and even for people who have never read the comic books. ","genre":null},{"date":"19 July 2000","score":"","review":"  Finally!

At first sight of the guy who was playing Wolverine, I feared the worst.  I mean, what are you gonna expect from a bunch of people running around in spandex.  Thankfully, however, we were spared spandex in place of leather.  I don't believe they could've picked a better cast for the X-Men.  Halle Berry was kinda weak as the part of Storm.  Hugh Jackman amazed me.  Even though he was much taller than Wolverine, he played him exactly like you would read in the comic.  I was amazed.  He has the character down.  Other than Wolverine, I enjoyed Rogue.  Besides her being a total babe, she did a great job.  Anna Paquin was perfect for the role.  The other actors were decent for their roles.  Patrick Stewart makes a good Professor X.  Ian McKellan an okay Magneto, but nothing like you'd imagine from the comic.All in all, I think this movie did the comic justice.  Except for a few complaints it was good.  I didn't however see Cannonball or Colossus in the movie.  Go figure.  And who knows, maybe the X-fans will get their wish next time around.  What better mutant to kick off the second movie than Gambit. Least that's what they're saying.  I'll definitely be in line for the next.
