Helena and Kenneth have amazing chemistry together and are talented actors. The movie seems almost like a portrait you can stare at, it's so beautiful. The scenery was simply breathtaking. The costumes were very grandiose and applied the right feel to this movie. I read the book in highschool and noticed the differences, but it didn't make me despise the movie because of its inaccuracies. I actually like the movie better than the book. The book was a little boring, but I think the movie conquered that. Anyways, this is about the film. Frankenstein has a great message. Don't play God. He's much better at it and has far more experience. I think science is God explained and God isn't against knowledge and a quest for searching and understanding, but everything needs to be done in moderation. Unfortunately, Victor pushed it too far. I can empathize with Victor's character and his devotion to life. How he simply can't understand why good people die and just the cruelty of nature. However, there's a purpose to that and he finds himself learning his lesson the hard way. I liked that the creature (as the credits call him) has his own characterization for why he does things. It's not senseless violence, but survival against a world that doesn't understand him. De Niro tapped into that very well and that he desperately wants to be good, but the odds are against him. I think a lot of humans are like that without his added issues. The plot was just great and so was the acting. I loved the music. It added such a romantic swell without being entirely overpowering. There's many layers to this film the love story, friendships, man's mind, consequences of actions...it goes on. This movie tackles all of them greatly. SPOILER STARTS HERE!!! When Elizabeth finds out that he brought her back to life, Helena's acting was superb. She reacted so believably that I was made a true fan. She cannot understand why he would bring her back to this instead of letting her go and this angers her to the point of killing herself for good. She understands immediately what Victor doesn't. You can't expect someone to live looking like that. SPOILERS END!!! The road to hell is paid with good intentions is what I got from this movie.This movie can be applied on today's terms with all the increasing technologies about how to sustain life and cloning people and the various consequences of that. Please do rent this ASAP.

All the sub-stories during the making of this film overshadow the fact that this is easily one of the top ten movies ever made. Definitely in the class with epics like Gone With the Wind and Lawrence of Arabia, Giant is a 200-minute symphony of a movie about the life of a Texas cattle rancher (Oscar-nominee Rock Hudson) and his wife from the East Coast (Elizabeth Taylor). Immediately following their marriage, Hudson's older sister (Mercedes McCambridge, Oscar-nominated) dies after falling off the same horse that Hudson had bought from Taylor's father. Disgusted with the fact that Hudson had married Taylor, McCambridge had decided to leave a small part of her land to quiet cow-hand James Dean (in his finest performance, garnering him his second consecutive posthumous Oscar nomination). Hudson is advised to buy the land from Dean, but Dean refuses to sell. Now Dean is trying to strike oil and is ultimately successful. He becomes a huge oil baron and one of the richest and most powerful men in Texas. Hudson continues to make money as well, but eventually has to swallow his pride and become a wild-catter himself. The hate and friction between Hudson and Dean is sure to lead to fireworks for all associated with the two volatile men. Secretly, Dean has always loved Taylor and even goes so far as to try and get with Taylor's youngest daughter (a brilliant turn by Carroll Baker). Dean is trying to substitute Baker for the lover he has always had for Taylor. By this time Dean is well in his 50s (due to heavy makeup), but he is trying to capture the failed dreams of his youth. Ultimately, Dean has everything except the one thing he really wanted. He lacks love in his life and he suffers miserably through as the film progresses. The older twin children of Hudson and Taylor's both grow up to go in very different directions. The daughter (Fran Bennett) marries and wants to run the ranch, to Hudson's approval and Taylor's dismay. However, the son (a very young Dennis Hopper) marries a Hispanic woman (very taboo back in those days) and wants to go north to become a doctor. Of course Hudson is outraged at this development and nearly disowns Hopper all together. Hudson then decides that Bennett's new husband (Earl Holliman) may be the best for the job. Holliman though is immediately drafted into World War II, along with Hispanic laborer Sal Mineo. Hudson worries about change after he passes away, but he eventually learns that most of the things he obsesses about are not as important as other matters. Equality for females and Hispanic Americans are major messages throughout here. Much like novelist Edna Ferber's equally excellent Cimarron (which dealt with sexism and racism toward Native- and African-Americans in Oklahoma), Giant paints a wonderfully complex picture of humanistic relationships from varying cinematic angles. Overall, Giant is a huge motion picture that is so smart, multi-layered and deep-thinking that it requires over three hours to tell the entire story. Everything here is so magnificent. The Oscar-winning direction by George Stevens, the screenplay, the art direction, the editing, the costume design, the makeup, the sound and the original musical score are all superb. Almost every actor does the best work of their respective careers as well. James Dean and Rock Hudson are the best. Mercedes McCambridge (albeit in a very small role) is super. Dennis Hopper and Carroll Baker (Baker even received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress in 1956 for Baby Doll) both show amazing range at their very young ages. Chill Wills (who plays Hudson's old wise uncle) and Elizabeth Taylor give stellar performances as always. Overlooked in 1956 (the unmemorable Around the World in 80 Days won the Best Picture Oscar), Giant is easily the best film from that weak year and is ranked as the best movie of that decade in my book. One of the most excellent productions of all time. 5 stars out of 5.

Whereas X2 collapses under the weight of a huge cast and contents itself with running helter-skelter from one battle to the next, X-Men concentrates on a few characters and takes its time setting up a fascinating universe.Believe it or not, Senator Kelly is the most important character; he establishes the essential moral conflict that faces mutants and society.  And while he's clearly supposed to be wrong, the film allows him to have a point.  The Brotherhood is, after all, a sinister bunch (THESE are the mutants he's worried about!), and we are clearly supposed to feel sympathy for Kelly after he is tortured and killed by them.  Ultimately, the film does have a powerful (and Liberal) message of tolerance, but it treats its message's opponent with respect, and I admire that sense of fairness.Aside from all the deep stuff, the movie is also a rockin' good time.  Stylish direction, nifty effects (that are not overused, as in the sequel), and a few good action sequences keep the proceedings from becoming too pompous and preachy.  Magneto's origin segment is effective, if a tad thoughtless (I'm not quite sure if it trivializes the Holocaust or not), and poor Rogue's isolation is well-conveyed.  Jackman is a cool Wolverine (I'm glad he was basically unknown), and even Cyclops and Jean Grey aren't bad.  The only real loss is Halle Berry as Storm, who can't act to save her life; I haven't seen Monster's Ball, but I can hardly believe that such a wooden performer won an Oscar for another film!  Perhaps she thinks that she's too good for this material; in that case, she shouldn't have been cast.That bump aside, this movie is all good.  Kamen's score is over-the-top but it fits, and is certainly more engaging than Ottman's annoying orchestral blasts in X2.

Most likely what most people do when it happens to them -- go to marriage counseling or seek a nasty divorce. Edward (Richard Gere) does something different he kills the man his wife is seeing and tries to cover up the crime. It is, in a way, the perfect murder -- no one else knew about the affair his wife was having, no evidence traced the victim to his killer. At least that is what Edward thinks as he rushes to attend his son's school play.Soon the irony starts and the tension builds. Edward gave his wife, Connie (Diane Lane), a snow globe as a present. She then gave it to her lover (Olivier Martinez). And when Edward finally confronts his wife's newfound boy toy prior to the killing, he sees the globe sitting near his bed. Where did you get this? he asks, before delivering a massive blow to the side of his enemy's face and inadvertently killing him with the glass ball.It's an accident. He didn't mean to kill the man and he didn't even mean to overreact. But as the reality of the affair bombards his senses, Edward literally collapses, sent into a spiraling downfall of vengeance and anger.It's Richard Gere's best performance -- ever. I'm not a fan of Gere, but he brings so much raw intensity and reality to his character here that it's hard to not realize his performance as one of the best of the decade thus far. Observe his facial features as he examines the bedroom of his wife's lover. Imagine yourself in his place and imagine yourself not reacting the exact same way.But Gere is also able to bring a touching sense of love and humanity to Edward. His affection for his wife is as clear as sparkling water, and the day she comes home after encountering her new boyfriend he suspects something is wrong. Watch Gere in this film and you'll soon find yourself reconsidering whether or not he's that bad of an actor. I know I did. And you actually empathize with him. This is the man whose films have made more money the more he has become naked on-screen; the man who is renowned for being a playboy hotshot and a sleazy celebrity pretty boy. But yet in Unfaithful, Gere abandons this self-made image, and plays a meek, nerdy family man living a modest life with a wife and a son. He wears glasses, lives an ordinary wife and actually respects his wife. His performance is spot-on and heartfelt, to say the least. I could have imagined almost anyone playing this role, except Gere. His performance is amazing.After killing Martinez and dumping the body in the back of his car, Edward takes the snow globe home. He places it on a shelf behind many other souvenir globes. Imagine Connie's surprise when she sees it there, and imagine the irony in the situation they both know that they know each other's secret. Yet since they both are shameful of what they are done, they are too scared to confront each other, for fear of being accused of their own crimes.Unfaithful is one of the most elegant and firmly constructed thrillers in years -- realistic, cruel, ironic, and irreverently erotic. It's not your standard-issue sleaze. It's not all heavy on sex and style like Basic Instinct and it's not pure stupidity, either. It's actually a thriller rooted in a touching story of marriage and faith, and everything else gradually follows thereafter.Like A Simple Plan, Bound and Fargo, Unfaithful is about one single event that suddenly causes a chain reaction of horrific ones. In A Simple Plan, the moment that Hank took the cash was the moment his life changed forever. The moment that Corky's plan proceeded forwards in Bound was the moment that all hell broke loose and everything went wrong. And the moment that Jerry Lundegaard sent those two bumbling idiots on their way to kidnap his wife and hold her ransom was the same moment in time that his life would begin to dramatically fall apart, almost overnight. And the moment that Edward strikes his wife's lover with a small glass snowball is the moment that both of their wives -- his own and his wife's -- change forever. I love these sorts of movies, the kind that take your average, innocent passersby and place them in an unfortunate chain reaction that leads to a major downfall in their lives. Why do I love these movies? I think for the same reason that has made them all so successful we love to watch characters corrupt themselves and get caught in conspiracies where they are literally fighting to stay above water. The scene in Fargo where Jerry's plan falls apart all at once is a great example of this.This is Adrian Lynne's crowning achievement. It's glossy and masterfully, beautifully constructed. It's eerie and realistic and has a noticeably strong, yet strangely subtle, presence. I cannot imagine a more effective, sensitive and touching adaptation of this story that will surely hit close to home for many people out there. Even if it's not relative to your life, you will still find yourself deeply absorbed by the lead characters and their turmoil. Unfaithful has its flaws, but I find it hard to think of a more effective and beautiful thriller of its genre made within the past five years.4\/5 stars. - John Ulmer ","genre":null},{"date":"24 March 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  What would you do if you found out that your spouse was having an affair outside of your marriage? Most likely what most people do when it happens to them -- go to marriage counseling or seek a nasty divorce. Edward (Richard Gere) does something different he kills the man his wife is seeing and tries to cover up the crime. It is, in a way, the perfect murder -- no one else knew about the affair his wife was having, no evidence traced the victim to his killer. At least that is what Edward thinks as he rushes to attend his son's school play.Soon the irony starts and the tension builds. Edward gave his wife, Connie (Diane Lane), a snow globe as a present. She then gave it to her lover (Olivier Martinez). And when Edward finally confronts his wife's newfound boy toy prior to the killing, he sees the globe sitting near his bed. Where did you get this? he asks, before delivering a massive blow to the side of his enemy's face and inadvertently killing him with the glass ball.It's an accident. He didn't mean to kill the man and he didn't even mean to overreact. But as the reality of the affair bombards his senses, Edward literally collapses, sent into a spiraling downfall of vengeance and anger.It's Richard Gere's best performance -- ever. I'm not a fan of Gere, but he brings so much raw intensity and reality to his character here that it's hard to not realize his performance as one of the best of the decade thus far. Observe his facial features as he examines the bedroom of his wife's lover.

She absolutely will not watch it again and refuses to let me play it while she is in the oom.  --------------POSSIBLE SPOILERS------------  This movie is a masterpiece for its genre. I especially appreciate several of it's rarities. First, it's seriousness.No lame jokes and sarcasm that is so prevalent today. No super macho junk. Nobody fighting the monster with martial arts. Nobody telling their life's story. Nobody saying fire in the hole, he's mine, or any other too cool cliches of today. No woman dressed to kill hefting a shotgun or the latest bazooka. No distracting romance or flirting with the opposite sex. Example ,the movie Speed. Sandra Bullock flirting with, laughing with, being coy with Keanu Reeves while driving a bus with a bomb underneath it. Give me a break!!!  The Thing is a serious movie. It is believable.  It is about 12 men facing a monstrous problem and nothing else. That is enough.  Jokes , sarcasm, cliches, and any romance would have ruined it's hard edge. They would have made it infinitely less scary. It is a simple movie without distracting side storylines. This is really a one of a kind movie the likes which will probably never be seen again. I think ole John C. and Rob Bottin really were hell bent to top Alien and they did. To me they topped everything else too. Too bad JC did'nt wait a while for ET to go away to release it. Many people do not agree with me about the movie's merits and it does have it's faults but I hope I can one day see a more perfect horror movie than this. This is the movie that every SIFI and horror movie promised to be but this and only this delivered all the goods.And without a rubber suit, computers, and very little stop motion.(One scene with stop motion at the end got deleted before release--it is included on the dvd) Side note- I don't fully agree that it is all that bloody. Most of the red stuff comes from the alien when it melts.Most of the gore is the alien creature when it changes shapes.Except for the chest with teeth scene there really are almost no scenes where humans are shown much bloodshed(Watch it again and you will see what I'm talking about). Even the guy who gets his head roped into the creatures jawhead only has creature red stuff on him and his head is melting when he gets lose. The people who have a problem with the dog's head splitting should realize that it is the alien dog, not a regular dog. Get real, people.This alien is SERIOUS and is an equal opportunity advocate. My favorite scene?? The begining, the end, and everything in between. As for the guy who said he did not see any actors he knew except Kirk Russel. How many TV shows and movies has he seen??

They really do have it all - anyone who cannot enjoy them must be too removed from the material to fully appreciate them, or feel that they have to disjoin themselves from everyone who loves or likes the films - just because they can.But that is not what I want to dwell on.  For me 'Fellowship' is the most powerful of the three films because anyone who has ever been part of a group of true mates can relate to the events within the film.'Fellowship' - like Tolkien's book - is basically a 'road story'.  On the journey new bonds are made and tragically broken.  It also has alot to say about different races interactions, and how it is possible to all get on, if hangs-up were hanged up.THe hobbits are naturally friendly creatures and so we sympathise with them straight away.  We bond to Aragorn because he takes up the role of father to Frodo, Boromir becomes the dad of Merry and Pippin with Gandalf as the overseeing grandad that they all look to.  Most importantly of all - they're a bunch of mates who really care for each other.At first its just because they have to, but Jackson reminds us of the mutual bonding by including scenes such as the camping play fighting, Aragorn being calm and thoughtful with Pippin the idiot, or Frodo and Sam stumbbling home after a night on the razzle.When the Fellowship breaks up (this really begins with Gandalf's death) there is a genuine tradgedy.  None of us would like to think our own mates could be taken away from us but if there is a film that encaptures the sadness of such an event then its Fellowship.  The results are truly heart wrenching - and I don't mind sounding like a big girl for saying it.But as Gandalf says Hope remains, when we see Aargorn and the lads set out to rescue their caputred friends Merry and Pippin.  Frodo has Sam and Boromir showed his true worth when he gave his life for his boys.And we know, through the strength of the relationships shoen on screen, that one day they might all be together again, which is bloody marvellous really.Yes its a spectacle, yes its got a great storyline, but the essence of FEllowship is in the growing relationship between nine very different people, and how they come to rely on and love each other.See it now.  Its essential viewing.

They really do have it all - anyone who cannot enjoy them must be too removed from the material to fully appreciate them, or feel that they have to disjoin themselves from everyone who loves or likes the films - just because they can.But that is not what I want to dwell on.  For me 'Fellowship' is the most powerful of the three films because anyone who has ever been part of a group of true mates can relate to the events within the film.'Fellowship' - like Tolkien's book - is basically a 'road story'.  On the journey new bonds are made and tragically broken.  It also has alot to say about different races interactions, and how it is possible to all get on, if hangs-up were hanged up.THe hobbits are naturally friendly creatures and so we sympathise with them straight away.  We bond to Aragorn because he takes up the role of father to Frodo, Boromir becomes the dad of Merry and Pippin with Gandalf as the overseeing grandad that they all look to.

True, Hammett's Maltese Falcon does feature a nude scene and more explicit references to homosexuality, but aside from that, this film is missing nothing (and, arguably, it's all the better for avoiding the direct approach to certain issues).  All you need to do is look at the other film versions of the same book to see that only this one is a classic; only this one really captures the right tone.Of course, that tone is somewhat unpleasant; Spade is not the nicest character, and everyone else is worse.  It's perhaps hard to swallow that Spade would deceive and cheat his partner in so many ways, but then get worked up about the man's death.  But I can buy it; aren't we all fallible and inconsistent?  Certainly, Philip Marlowe presents a more likable figure in The Big Sleep, but Spade is clearly a more well-defined character.The trouble is, The Big Sleep is noticeably more modern than this movie, and more entertaining.  By comparison, The Maltese Falcon is not terribly sexy (I'm not sure that Astor works as a seductress) and rather slow-paced. However, these two sins don't detract (much) from the film's success.  The supporting cast is so perfect (aren't Greenstreet and Lorre just the greatest character actors of all time?) and the music is so evocative that I can forgive the odd slip or slowdown.A perhaps pointless aside Susan Sontag calls this a camp film, probably because it tries very hard to be serious but is, in fact, exaggerated and a bit silly.  But exaggeration is exactly what the detective genre, and the original novel, are all about.  The Maltese Falcon has no cause to be embarrassed by its camp label, then.

The most impactual element for me - back then - was the extreme nature of the violence, and therin lies the main problem people have with the text.Yes, as a ten year old, the blood and gore is the main attraction - but Robocop is a film which rises above the box office draw reasons to create a multilayered and meaningful film.The notions of corporate power are explicitly unmdermined as inherantly corrupt in the ruthless characterisations of Dick Jones et el.  The police are portrayed  as humans with faults - unusual for a film whose principle charcter is a cyborg hero.  And of course the lead role is a perfect vehicle for an examination of what REALLY makes us 'human'.The inclusion of the way the American media sanitises shocking events and turns them into entertainment, or even something to sell, is especially relevent today.The special armour effects by Rob Bottin are second to none, the stop motion - although dated - fits perfectly with the style of the film and does not stand out as a bad thing, and Verhoven pulls all of the punches on the witty dialogue and visceral violence.  Weller shines in the role of Murphy and Clarence Boddicker is a suitably soddish villain.Many people feel that the storytlene mirrors that of Christ - its certainly about retributional violence and Murphy is an almost Christ-like figure (at least in his progression) so maybe there is some weight to the argument.

Never again would the Bond films be this over the top or overtly silly, but the truth is that Moonraker does it right. It will never win awards for being the most subtle Bond film ever made, but it should not be trashed in the way that it usually is because deep down Moonraker is just great fun. Roger Moore's Bond is just fun to be with, the on going joke that everytime Jaws tries to kill Bond he almost gets killed himself, complete with close ups of his exasperated face are brilliant (not subtle, but guaranteed to get you chuckling) and one of the loveliest Bond girls, CIA agent Holly Goodhead. The script here is definitely not in the same league as the likes of From Russia With Love, The World is Not Enough, Licence to Kill or For Your Eyes Only, but Bond films never set out to be thought provoking pieces of art, they are meant to be grandiose fun pieces of entertainment and if you take Bond films on those levels then Moonraker succeeds admirably. Sure none of the acting is award worthy, and its frequently over the top in every regard. Over the top humor, over the top action sequences (a fight scene in a glass shop sees every bit of glass get destroyed) while the space sequences features a gigantic space battle complete with laser beams.However there is a lot to like here. The pre title sequence is superb, featuring some of the best stunt work you will ever see in a pre-Brosnan Bond, the special effects are magnificent and lastly John Barry's music is quite simply the best he has ever come up with. For a film so over the top his music is beautiful and would set the hallmarks for his future scores. The sweeping orchestra and beautiful theme song by Shirley Bassey are classics.Once again I end my review with a note not to judge me, but Moonraker is simply wonderful entertainment and one of my favorite Bond film of all time.

I cannot believe I heard somewhere that this was a classic(WTF????) To be fair, the film is not completely without merit, but the bad significantly(and I mean significantly) outweighs the good.So whats the problem with the film? The first problem is that the pacing is uneven. At first, the film moves slowly but not too slowly. However, at other times it moves at a glacial pace and threatens to put the viewer to sleep.The acting is also highly uneven. However, someone should be given an A for effort. That person is Margot Kidder. Kidder gives a convincing performance but it belongs in a better film. James Brolin gives it a try and is occasionally creepy, but a bit stiff on other occasions. Everyone else in the film is forgettable.The biggest flaws in the film are its overlong running time and a meandering script. First off, there is some useless material in the script. The scenes that deal with Rod Steiger's character. Are they really necessary at all? They just seem like a way to get the movie a nearly full two-hour running time. They could have been excised and nothing would not have changed. It would have made the film a little more bearable.Also, who the hell thought some of this sh*t was scary? Lots of Flies? 1500 dollars just disappearing? I do not find any of that stuff scary. What the hell would a house want with 1500 dollars? There is a scene where the babysitter is trapped in a closet that is a little creepy. However, then there are two ridiculous scenes. The Red Eyes? That could have been a creepy scene but it comes off as rather corny. The Psycho-type music is jarringly out of place. Also, the ending fails to generate any tension. What the hell is that thing in the addict? I heard somewhere it was a pig. Again, thats not scary.Amityville Horror does have a nice amount of atmosphere. It at least got that right.

I cannot believe I heard somewhere that this was a classic(WTF????) To be fair, the film is not completely without merit, but the bad significantly(and I mean significantly) outweighs the good.So whats the problem with the film? The first problem is that the pacing is uneven. At first, the film moves slowly but not too slowly. However, at other times it moves at a glacial pace and threatens to put the viewer to sleep.The acting is also highly uneven. However, someone should be given an A for effort. That person is Margot Kidder. Kidder gives a convincing performance but it belongs in a better film. James Brolin gives it a try and is occasionally creepy, but a bit stiff on other occasions. Everyone else in the film is forgettable.The biggest flaws in the film are its overlong running time and a meandering script. First off, there is some useless material in the script. The scenes that deal with Rod Steiger's character. Are they really necessary at all? They just seem like a way to get the movie a nearly full two-hour running time. They could have been excised and nothing would not have changed. It would have made the film a little more bearable.Also, who the hell thought some of this sh*t was scary? Lots of Flies? 1500 dollars just disappearing? I do not find any of that stuff scary. What the hell would a house want with 1500 dollars? There is a scene where the babysitter is trapped in a closet that is a little creepy. However, then there are two ridiculous scenes. The Red Eyes? That could have been a creepy scene but it comes off as rather corny. The Psycho-type music is jarringly out of place. Also, the ending fails to generate any tension. What the hell is that thing in the addict? I heard somewhere it was a pig. Again, thats not scary.Amityville Horror does have a nice amount of atmosphere. It at least got that right. A remake is in the making and it would be interesting to see if the filmmakers could do some improvements. It really needs alot. Amityville Horror is not unwatchable but I cannot find a good enough reason to recommend it to anyone.

This is pretty much a flawless work, from Collin Welland's script, the memorable music by Vangelis, Hugh Hudson's tight direction through to the sparkling performances by Nigel Havers and co.It is, perhaps, more a story of struggling against odds than a straight-out sporting historical drama.Both main protagonists, the Jewish Harold Abrahams and the Scottish Eric Liddell, fought against circumstances (either from without or self-imposed) to achieve their goals.That the film manages to make this point without crashing down into maudlin sentimentality is yet another definite point in its favour.

Maybe not inconsistent, but complicated. In general, I'm bothered by funny or glorified violence, and From Dusk 'Till Dawn wallows in both. From the moment that the heroes set fire to a convenience store clerk, they lose all of my sympathy. They're every bit as repulsive as the vampires - so who cares if they win or lose? An essential element of horror is that the victims should be likable, so we can be alarmed at the prospect of their deaths; here, they're a bunch of jerks.The film could still be good, if viewed on an entirely superficial level, but it's not. Rodriguez's over-the-top action just looks tacky. The CGI effects are already ludicrous, the vampire makeups are silly (rubberized demons - what is this, a BBC production?), and the violence is neither exciting nor scary - it's merely gross.Check the trivia section and note that Quentin Tarantino - that fiercely original screenwriter and director - ripped off all of the film's best lines from older movies. I guess it was too much effort to come up with an original script, right? Of course, the siege aspect of the story comes right out of Night of the Living Dead and about 10,000 other horror films. At least Sex Machine acknowledges one debt - the improvised cross is lifted from Peter Cushing's Horror of Dracula, a film that's superior to this pile of crap in virtually every respect.This is horror for the stupid set, a movie where the coolest thing in evidence is a crotch cannon. It's SO mindless that I can't even appreciate it on the same level as bad Godzilla; it's TRYING to be campy and stupid, but at the same time masquerading as a piece of decent film art created by famous people, and it's that clash of styles that bothers me so. This film is dishonest. It's a turd wrapped in silk. It thumbs its nose at horror while trying to horrify. In short, it's maybe the worst film I've ever seen...and I've had to sit through it twice!

There may be some things in this movie that are not entirely true, and the movie is slanted, but the feel for Flint is absolutely dead on.*SPOILERS*The idea behind the movie is Moore trying to get Roger Smith to visit Flint; or rather, those areas of Flint that have suffered while GM has abandoned the town in favor of cheaper labor.  Moore has an everyman demeanor, right down to the Out for Trout hat he wears throughout the movie.  This allows him to get away with a few things that might otherwise tick us off the guy at the Private Club and the Security Giards that force Moore to leave are just poor schlubbs doing their jobs, after all.  On the other hand, I felt a moment of justice when Moore was almost gleefully unfair to a Flint PR flack whose move to Tel Aviv coincides with, but probably did not actually cause, the intafada, or when the GM applogist PR man was laid off.

Smith never visits Flint, of course, and Moore's one chance to speak at a shareholder's meeting is ended when his mike is cut.
