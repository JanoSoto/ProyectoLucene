It doesn't really have any sort of plot, just our beloved Caped Crusader running around at night murdering a bunch of thugs and trying to save Gotham from Jack Nicholson on LSD, eer - I mean the Joker. the Joker's role in the film is cartoony, but still creepy. He is capable to pull off the laugh, but still went to far into showing his origin. Which is a mistake In my opinion. 'Batman' is an embarrassment to Jim Gordon's character. Gordon is far more important then Robin, Nightwing, etc. he's up there with Alfred, sometimes an even more superior character then Alfred can be. in these movies he was reduced to a 15 minute screen time of a fat idiot who said lines like thanks for saving the day, Batman! Go, get 'em Batman! and he left us the signal! Harvey Dent was a waste of time, why was he even in this film? Michael Gough does pull off a great performance. Decent film, but too many flaws.

Escape from L.A. is a mixed bag to be honest, there are some great scenes here like the bike & car chases but then there are also poor ones like the silly surfing & hand gliding sequences. Some of the action felt a little static & dull, the end sequence in particular just felt shoddily made & lacklustre. The violence is relatively tame, there's some fights, some shooting & an off screen decapitation. The basketball sequence is cool if a little improbable although having said that Kurt Russell made every hoop including the full length of the court one which is quite amazing actually.With a supposed budget of about $50,000,000 Escape from L.A. was a well funded film, the sets are good, the majority of the special effects are as well although there are one or two which don't hold up these days.

If that seems like too much crime drama stereotype for one film, let me assure you that it all works and it works well. That's why L.A. Confidential is hailed as one of the best films of the 1990s, though it should be seen as the precedent- setter for the crime drama-obsessed decade that followed it.The plot is too intricate to summarize briefly, but after LAPD cops and detectives beat up on several jailed Mexicans because the Mexicans had allegedly been responsible for the beating of two other cops, the bad press for the LAPD sets into motion a sequence of events that become further worsened when a massacre occurs at a coffee shop. Bud White (Crowe), Jack Vicennes (Spacey) and Ed Exley (Pearce) are all very different cops who go about investigating the case differently but end up closer to each other than they realize.LAC can be viewed in two separate halves. The first hour feels like a film in itself and the second hour feels totally different until the ending ties the two together. The feeling you get is the film is long, especially because mystery-wise your brain has been working in overdrive if you like to try and figure things out. It's a wild ride, albeit a very good one.The acting is all phenomenal. Everyone plays terrific characters. The film was just the beginning for Crowe's leading roles, Spacey works his lovably hateable charm and Pearce really adds a different dimension to the cast as highly moral justice-driven cop. Even Kim Basinger as a woman involved with and caught up in this mystery seems to steal every scene that she's in with her beauty and poise.The only thing going against the film is at times it does feel over-the-top with all the plot lines going on, especially at the end, but at that point you're so caught up in the well-developed characters and their subsequent motives, as well as the mystery, that the feeling is easy to block out.

The problems with this shamelessly manipulative movie are many, and they all begin with the inevitable premise that tough Texas matron Aurora Greenway can carry on without being challenged by her feisty daughter Emma. However, without Debra Winger's earthy grit counterbalancing Shirley MacLaine's flamboyant disapproval, the story seems to work in a vacuum. Much of the appeal and resonance of the first film was how these characters dealt with life's unpredictable course and how James L. Brooks captured their idiosyncrasies with a refreshing level of honesty for a mainstream film.That point is completely missed as Robert Harling takes over for Brooks and takes the episodic approach that seemed to work for his screenplay for 1989's Steel Magnolias. Based on Larry McMurtry's sequel novel, the story picks up Aurora's story fifteen years after Emma's death as we see true to her daughter's final wishes, that the grandiose older woman has raised Emma's three children. Now adults, oldest son Tommy is in prison for drug dealing, while youngest son Teddy has become standard white trash who wants only to own a tow truck. That leaves granddaughter Melanie who has inherited her mother's independent streak as she struggles in a bad relationship with an aspiring underwear model. Without Emma, Melanie picks up the slack and so do two minor characters from the first film - Emma's best friend Patsy, who has become a wealthy divorcée constantly competing with Aurora, and Aurora's salt-of-the-earth maid Rosie.The movie becomes a virtual traffic jam of personal problems orbiting around Aurora with the second half an endless series of dramatic climaxes. MacLaine does the best she can under the circumstances, but the rest of the cast is set adrift. Bill Paxton looks particularly lost as the psychotherapist in love with Aurora. Juliette Lewis uses her familiar off-kilter mannerisms as Melanie, while Miranda Richardson is forced to play Patsy on two notes - petulant jealousy and benign resignation. Nicholson's appearance is welcome, but he understandably looks like he wants to leave the minute he arrives to remind Aurora of her enduring appeal. Only Marion Ross and Ben Johnson acquit themselves respectably as Rosie and her husband-to-be Arthur. Except for MacLaine's work, this overlong slog is really unbearable to watch.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"17 April 2008","score":"","review":" By the time Jack Nicholson shows up for about five minutes of screen time as Garrett Breedlove, this turgid 1996 sequel to 1983's Terms of Endearment has already slogged through two deaths, a psychotherapist with an Oedipal complex, and a lot of scrapbooks. The problems with this shamelessly manipulative movie are many, and they all begin with the inevitable premise that tough Texas matron Aurora Greenway can carry on without being challenged by her feisty daughter Emma. However, without Debra Winger's earthy grit counterbalancing Shirley MacLaine's flamboyant disapproval, the story seems to work in a vacuum. Much of the appeal and resonance of the first film was how these characters dealt with life's unpredictable course and how James L. Brooks captured their idiosyncrasies with a refreshing level of honesty for a mainstream film.That point is completely missed as Robert Harling takes over for Brooks and takes the episodic approach that seemed to work for his screenplay for 1989's Steel Magnolias. Based on Larry McMurtry's sequel novel, the story picks up Aurora's story fifteen years after Emma's death as we see true to her daughter's final wishes, that the grandiose older woman has raised Emma's three children. Now adults, oldest son Tommy is in prison for drug dealing, while youngest son Teddy has become standard white trash who wants only to own a tow truck. That leaves granddaughter Melanie who has inherited her mother's independent streak as she struggles in a bad relationship with an aspiring underwear model. Without Emma, Melanie picks up the slack and so do two minor characters from the first film - Emma's best friend Patsy, who has become a wealthy divorcée constantly competing with Aurora, and Aurora's salt-of-the-earth maid Rosie.The movie becomes a virtual traffic jam of personal problems orbiting around Aurora with the second half an endless series of dramatic climaxes. MacLaine does the best she can under the circumstances, but the rest of the cast is set adrift. Bill Paxton looks particularly lost as the psychotherapist in love with Aurora. Juliette Lewis uses her familiar off-kilter mannerisms as Melanie, while Miranda Richardson is forced to play Patsy on two notes - petulant jealousy and benign resignation. Nicholson's appearance is welcome, but he understandably looks like he wants to leave the minute he arrives to remind Aurora of her enduring appeal. Only Marion Ross and Ben Johnson acquit themselves respectably as Rosie and her husband-to-be Arthur. Except for MacLaine's work, this overlong slog is really unbearable to watch. The 2001 DVD offers no significant extras.

In her last days, Mary draws some bizarre pictures of a baffling winged creature. Two years pass and while Klein is driving to meet the governor of Virginia when his car breaks down, he seeks help from a local, Gordon Smallwood (Will Patton) who accuses Klein of stalking him.

He comes across Sergeant Connie Parker (Laura Linney) who tells him that in the past few weeks, the locals have been filing sighting reports of a winged creature. Curiosity gets the better of Klein and he decides to investigate further since the locals' description of the creature matches his wife's drawings. As the story unfolds, he seeks the help of a paranormal expert Alexander Leek (Alan Bates) to ascertain if this creature, 'Mothman,' wants to tell him and the residents something.The movie is based on a book that narrates true paranormal events that rocked Point Pleasant in 1966.

Demonstrating an unusually deft touch at handling potentially incendiary subject matter, Reiner's unwillingness to let his source material glide by on its controversy is what raises his film from the ranks of average, instead culminating as a tremendous success. The result A Few Good Men, one of the most fervently engaging legal dramas in modern cinema, which even decades down the line maintains its political poignancy and searing emotional tension.Unsurprisingly, Aaron Sorkin's snappy, intelligent screenplay (adapted from his own play) is the real highlight, making what could have been a rote courtroom thriller bristle with emotional intensity and vivacity, leading for some highly quotable lines (Nicholson's legendary You can't handle the truth! is the highlight) while simultaneously making some intriguing points about the moral ambiguity of modern military, as well as the fanaticism instilled in young recruits. However, the film's emotional resonance is similarly laudable, as Reiner demonstrates a surprising ability to draw the audience in and present a highly familiar situation while extracting an exceptional amount of emotional engagement and making the audience care in a surprisingly vivid fashion. While the film does stumble into occasional sappy or clichéd patches, it mercifully dodges them at others (the exclusion of a romantic subplot between Cruise and Moore is a blessing) making the overall product far more satisfying. Technically the film also excels, as the quality cinematography and editing aid the transition from stage to film by adding a sweeping quality to the film punctuated by a clipped, military feel, perfectly capturing the terse tension and intrigue of the film. Similarly, Marc Shaiman's score is usually effective, substantially raising the tension with a quality mix of military drums and horns, but similarly overdoses on sentimental patriotic themes, often at crucial points of the film disappointingly enough. Despite the indisputable quality of Sorkin's script, it is really the actors who bring it to life, with each performer unquestionably operating at the peak of their considerable abilities. Tom Cruise perfectly essays the transition from cocky hotshot lawyer to a passionate, obsessive one striving for justice, and Cruise's immense charisma adds a strangely likable quality to what is mostly a highly unlikeable character when first introduced, while shining in later dramatic scenes. However, there is no question that the film is Jack Nicholson's show, timelessly inhabiting shady military Colonel Nathan R. Jessup like a weathered glove. One of the strongest points in his outstanding acting career, Nicholson crackles with ferocious muted intensity held to a captivating simmer, and with three (disappointingly but necessarily brief) scenes he sears the screen and walks away with the show with ease.Demi Moore also fumes with appropriate dramatic intensity as a lieutenant fiercely maintaining moral standpoints, taking the bulk of the film's weaker moments and infusing them with genuine passion. Kevin Pollack gives a firmly quality performance as Cruise's skeptical legal assistant, though many of his comedic moments seem out of place. The always reliable Kevin Bacon is superb, taking the thankless role of the opposing lawyer and infusing it with genuine energy and easygoing charm, alternating between effortlessly inciting the audience's hatred then defusing it with an endearing sense of humour without missing a beat. Keifer Sutherland is deliciously oily as an unscrupulous lieutenant, his detached, silky voice and fiery eyes making a genuinely detestable antagonist. A painstakingly crafted script, Reiner's quality direction and a few exceptional performances make for a resoundingly more than 'good' final outcome, as A Few Good Men achieves a level of emotional engagement few other courtroom dramas can muster. While certain patches of cliché or overdone American patriotism do slow the film down, its uniquely subversive take on fanatical patriotism makes for a more compelling and satisfying watch.

It's an altogether depressing tale that remains true to the facts of the period and directed with an artistic flourish by Eric Rohmer. The film is also in French with English subtitles which may turn off some potential viewers. Grace Elliott was a high-class courtesan who is most famous for being the mistress of the Duke of Orleans, a first cousin of the King of France (Louis XVI). Unfortunately for the King (and Grace), the Duke takes a position on the side of the radical Republicans and votes for Louis' death on the guillotine. The rest of the movie follows Grace as she does her best to avoid the same fate of her remaining Royalist friends. She barely makes it out alive. The Duke isn't so lucky. The Radical Jacobins turn on their own and in the ensuing blood bath (the Terror) the Duke finds out that what comes around goes around.All things considered, The Lady and the Duke is a fine period piece although some might find director Rohmer's technique a bit distracting. In lieu of real scenery, he films some scenes with his actors situated directly in front of large paintings of the countryside. It doesn't cheapen the movie in any way, but it is a bit excessive and overly ornate. One of his better scenes, and where he uses a real location shot, is when Ms. Elliott rides through Paris during severe upheaval and outbreaks of horrific violence. The chaos of the times is duly recorded and once again our heroine escapes with her head still on her shoulders.The Lady and the Duke features excellent performances by the two leads, Russell as Elliott and Jean-Claude Dreyfus as the Duke. The rest of the cast is uniformly good. The film is informative about the events of this tragic age and is worth viewing even if one is not a student of France's Revolution.

His radicalization is total, but it costs him dear, his wife Janet Suzman and his daughter Sussanah Harker leave him, but his young son Rowen Elnes sticks with dad.It's not that he doesn't gain a few new friends, African National Congress organizer Zakes Mokae, crusading journalist Susan Sarandon, and human rights attorney Marlon Brando. But he also gains a bitter and malevolent enemy in Special Branch Captain Jurgen Prochnow who apparently does damage control for the government. That includes outright murder of suspected opposition to the apartheid government.Every actor worth his salt loves a courtroom scene and Marlon Brando might have even come back for that in this film as well as the anti- apartheid cause. He got the film's only Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, but lost to Denzel Washington for Glory. I suspect given Marlon's history with Oscar folks were reluctant to vote for him.The film really belongs to star Donald Sutherland though and I think it a pity he wasn't given any Oscar nomination for this fine film with an eternal message about freedom.

And if you have build your identity up around being a star what do you have left if and when this happens? Absolutely nothing except your memories and the hope of returning to the screen. In the case of Norma Desmond you immediately sense how unrealistic the hope of returning to the screen is and you are horrified by her appearance which suggests to you that she is still playing one of her silent movies roles where it was important to overplay since there was no dialogue. Gloria Swanson is gruesome to watch in this role &#x96; this is acting on a level that you rarely see.Then she adds an incredible depth to her part as she shows us how vulnerable she feels towards Joe Gillis who in return is torn between contempt and some sort of affection towards her.

However for the most part the rest of the movie sucked. Now I know this isn't Alfred's fault. When a director starts out he doesn't always get to pick and choose his movies, but as a viewer that's not my problem. Hitchcock once said this is his worst movie.

At first 'Soylent' sounds like something you might put on your white rice at some fancy Chinese food restaurant. But in reality, at least the reality of 2022 New York, it's almost all that life is. In a future that wasn't too far from the truth as of 2008 in comparison to the conglomerization of corporations (i.e. fewer and fewer companies own things, now it's all scrunched together), 50% of the world's food is by the Soylent corporation, and meat or actual vegetables are so rare a commodity they have to be stolen undercover. Books are also hard to come by, so much so that they too need to be hidden from sight. It's in this realm of a dangerous, overcrowded and overcontroled society that Soylent Green, as a film, gains its power. It's a pretty frightening scenario, if filmed nevertheless (for the last time apparently) on 'old-school' MGM sets.Charlton Heston is very cool as a hero cop who just tries to do his job so someone else doesn't take it. He has a roommate\/mentor in Edward G. Robinson's Sol (Robinson's last role, he still's got it), and he reminds him of the 'good old days', where it wasn't the people so much as just having things, knowing things actually existed that didn't keep people trapped. Heston is investigating a murder of a high-society chap (Joseph Cotton, barely on-screen for a scene), who turns out to be an ex-board of director's member of Soylent corp. There's more than Heston would've thought, especially as he's tailed, falls for the young girl who used to look after Cotton's apartment, and soon finds the one tailing him is really out to kill him. What is the big deal about this guy, or for that matter Soylent Green? The answer is obvious to anyone who's had the film told to them what it's about (Heston's line towards the end is the sibling-quote to his last lines in Planet of the Apes, to put it that way). But even with that twist in the climax, it all unfolds in a fascinating form. It's mature sci-fi, with only a few jokey parts (i.e. the trucks plowing people away), and a hard edge to it, at least as far as hard-edged Charlton Heston vehicles can get. It's not even so much Fleischer's direction that makes it so compelling- though he is a consummate professional through and through and does, to his credit, make those final minutes with Robinson in the screening room incredible as moving cinema- but the screenplay. There's a lot to think about behind some of the dated action scenes; there's a thought process to go just a step farther, as entertainment and intellectually, as a piece of commercial work.

And always with the accompaniment of some exotic-inspired music soundtrack with conga drums accompanying lush strings. It came into vogue somewhere in the early 1960's with The Pink Panther, Doris Day films, and other light-hearted action-comedies. Even the original James Bond films jumped on the band-wagon. Charade, a movie NOT directed by Hitchcock, uses the psychedelic opening with the letters of the words dancing around the screen to Latin jazz rhythms which immediately gives away its 1960's roots.The plot is simple enough. Audrey Hepburn's spouse is dispatched and dumped from a train in France before the titles of the movie start dancing around the screen. Turns out he had $250,000 in his possession but the loot has vanished. For a guy worth $100,000's, no one comes to his funeral in Paris except three American baddies, a one-hand trench-coat, a southern red-neck, and an allergic nerd. They didn't come to sob at the funeral. Instead, they each visit Hepburn demanding the dearly departed's money. They threaten to dispatch her they way they did her husband. Of course, she turns out to be a lot more difficult than her husband who appears to have been knocked off without much of a struggle. She then turns to Cary Grant for help, until she discovers he has been lying about who he is. Whom can she trust? And of course, there is Walter Matthau, an American agent (or spy?), who represents the US government's interest in retrieving the money.What saves the movie is the clever banter between Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant. Of course, Grant has the wittiest lines, although Hepburn keeps up with him stride-for-stride, or rather line-for-line. At one point Hepburn points out she is a widow, and Grant replies that so was Juliet at 15. To which Hepburn says I am not 15! Grant then replies Well that's your trouble. You're too old for me. Grant was almost 60 and Hepburn was 34 when they made this movie.If some of the actors playing the baddies used their footage in this movie as the final exam for an acting class, they would have failed miserably. It's amazing the likes of George Kennedy and James Coburn weren't in the actors' unemployment line after the release of Charade. And some of the writing is also a bit weak, especially Kennedy, replete with prosthetic metal hand, walking around groaning Give me the money! And James Coburn as a Midwest red-neck called Tex whose lines are little better, if you can distinguish the words through his rough-and-ready rather mediocre attempt at a Texas accent. I doubt whether real Texans could understand what he is saying! You will neither confuse this movie with Film Noir of a couple of decades earlier nor with action movies a couple of decades later. The entire look and feel was born out of a slightly new Hollywood style where filmmakers were trying to give their work a little more pizazz than some of the overly fluffy stuff produced in the 1950's. Action movies were no longer set in dark urban America where lesser-known actors limped into alleyways to avoid their pursuers. Now, they were shot on location all over the world, often in Europe, with the biggest movie stars imaginable. And the experience wouldn't be complete without the innocent sexual innuendo that permeates these films. In Charade, Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, the Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig of Hollywood, take the audience on a roller-coaster ride of entertainment masquerading as over-the-top intrigue. It is just pure escapist entertainment, and you'll also breathe a little when you disembark from the roller-coaster. And it is a perfect representative of a bygone era of Hollywood film-making.

I could really relate to the characters. but the fact that it's a low budget movie really shows. and at times it shows in a way that bothered me. obviously nobody's fault. In fact, hats off to the creators of this movie, for what they managed to accomplish with limited funding (in fact, I don't know if this is really a low budget movie, I just assumed after seeing it it was. regardless, I gave it a 7 because of it's overall value. I'm not an adept of adapting my rankings to the budget of the movie) Another thing about this movie - the clichés. The cool, laid back dude paired with the restless, motivated dude, the drugs that, eventually, end up screwing things up (drugs are bad, mk? so don't do drugs, mk? cause drugs are bad, mk?), the choppers (themselves a cliché. don't think there's anyone who would ride across America on one of those), the hippie-hating rednecks, etc. perhaps at the time some of these were not yet clichés, I don't know. What really saves the movie, in my opinion, is the acting. Exceptional acting, in my opinion. I've seen quite a few movies about drugs, but I have to say I don't think I ever saw getting high so well portrayed so well. And I'm not talking about one of the guys, either. I'm talking about all of them. Almost makes me wonder if they weren't actually high. Then there's also something you don't see everyday in a low budget movie. A second layer. There's a little resentment there, especially from captain America, under all his cool, there's jack's character who's more than first meets the eye, and more. All in all, a movie I would watch again, but not more than once. A solid 7 in my book.

In the case of this film, it deals with the forbidden relation between men, one of whom is an upper class snob. That's not at all offensive, but the way the film crams it's monotonous and unnecessary message into our sympathetic eyes, it becomes tedious and rather quickly. There's no enduring his plight because he is so arrogant, and set in his ways of rigid family conformity and he's about as human as a pile of Welsh corn husks.Maurice Hall (James Wilby) is the said character, who is not that bright but along with other British spoiled thugs, is attending Oxford, or some other chum school. He hangs out with a few other mugs, who guzzle beer, sing school songs and slap each other on the arse when in the shower. Eventually, he meets a new bore, Clive Durham (Hugh Grant) and his interest is ignited. They hang out, clasping each other and visiting quiet secluded lakes.All seems fine until there is a change in Clive Durham's behavior. Maurice Hall is crushed over some time by his friend's denial of their true love. It's obvious Clive Durham wants power and will marry a woman for fear of losing his land, titles, nobility, etc. so the story takes another turn, much in the way a soap opera would appear.We pass through Maurice Hall's life, which is far from any ordinary working man's dilemma, as he travels, eats well and is afforded the luxury of the upper classes but he longs for more. It's exasperating as one would wish he would visit India and die of the plague or tuberculosis.The film then strays further into the rubbish pit by placating Maurice Hall with an unbelievable love interest portrayed by an effeminate, no good, deceitful gardener, who I might add, looks quite clean and unburnt by the sun. Any intelligent viewer will probably either shudder or cringe at the simplistic derailment of the plot but it was obvious that James Ivory was tugging our emotional strings all along, following the clichéd portrayal of social classes and making the love interest look like an underwear model.There's no clear protest message, except to follow your organ down below and you'll be happy. If you expect any critique of the hostile social climate, look elsewhere, this is muddy melodrama at its most dense form.See this film only if you want to believe in chimerical inspired fictional stories that are concocted and utterly delusional and preposterous.
