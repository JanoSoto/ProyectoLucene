It that sends shivers down your spine, then TO may be the movie for you. There's one unwritten rule in film making--specially when it comes to horror or suspense flicks--concerning immediacy. It means you don't get in a fuss because of something that may happen or not 30, 40, years down the road. Fear, terror, anguish are things that only work short term. If we were told that somewhere in the world there is one 5-year old brat who'll destroy it, some day far in the future, we'd just roll in our beds and go back to sleep. Lack of urgency, I say. That's why TO doesn't work for me, why I watched it with complete detachment, from beginning to end. Not to mention all the pseudo-religious mumbo-jumbo of course.I gather TO was a product of the success of The Exorcist, as much as of its shortcomings&#x97;-by which I mean what others have argued before about why its monster would bother torturing a girl when he got the whole world at his disposal. So I guess, TO tries to make up for that; it tries to fill up the hole by going global. But in the process it loses the urgency that's crucial in an horror or suspense movie, which means that at the end it is about a couple and their child instead of a single mom and her kid. Big deal for a change.The best thing that can be said of TO is that it respects the viewer. This is a well done flick in many respects but not a great one in any. The cinematography's good, reaching heights of excellence in sequences such as the killing of F. Brennan & the visit to the cemetery but with the decapitation providing rather for a cheap, voyeuristic low. The pace is sustained; it keeps you focused, except for a few dragged out scenes in the mansion. Soundtrack is appropriate, except for the male chorus, which I found out of place in an horror flick. Some say the atmosphere here is great but I can't relate to that. If you don't swallow the religious babble most likely you'll watch all with detachment. The acting is another weak point Peck seems to be always playing the same somber, humorless, dutiful but utterly dull, man; one good for all seasons anyway. He looks the same before Kathy is killed and after that. As for Reemick, she plays here more a damsel in distress than a Mrs. Ambassador--Rose Kennedy would be the last name coming to you when seeing her. Whitelaw didn't impress me all she did was to grimace and do evil stares. The dogs were Okay. But the best one is Warner, even if he constantly distracted me with his eerie resemblance to Gilligan&#x97;OK, maybe it's just me. But I had an even bigger problem trying to take the Forces of Evil (FOE) seriously.I disagree with the POV of these FOE being scary. They don't even rate high in my Smarts Scale, as they are sorely in need of putting their act together if they really want to destroy the world. The only reason why they prevail at the end is because the Thorns are even dumber. See, after the FOE make the nanny hang herself in such a shocking way, the couple should have been very careful at hiring her replacement. They should have interviewed dozens of applicants, inquired on every piece of information concerning weird habits, drug abuse, etc, which would have ruined the chances of FOE for planting an agent there. But what do they do instead? They accept without hesitation a total stranger, one who challenges their authority from the start, who even demands to be left alone with the kid! Wouldn't you say they had it coming? But the FOE don't fare better they show their abysmal ignorance of even the basics, of something that even Argento knew and included in his clunkers you kill those with important information BEFORE they open their mouths, no after. See for ex. how they kill Brennan AFTER he tells Thorn about Meggido and Bugenhagen. Later, why didn't they kill this last BEFORE he could give Thorn the knifes & inform him of the ritual to kill Damien? Instead they kill Jennings, with the result of convincing a wavering Thorn that Damien was truly evil.But the whole FOE plan smacks of amateurism. They plant the Devil's son in an affluent family so he could use that power and influence to become a U.S. President and blow up the world. Well, I have news for you, FOE the little guy won't find it easy to get up there. He'll have to work A LOT; he'll have to make campaigns, win primaries, raise funds, woo voters, and so on. So, at the end the whole thing looks just like a waste of time, when all what FOE had to do was to use the power it has, controlling the forces of Nature, to send us all to oblivion in a global fire, a monster tornado, whatever. That's why I don't find the flick a bit scary its resident Devil are so dumb, they wouldn't know their way out of a kiddie's sandbox, Duh.So, just good enough to view once, for entertainment, which means 6\/10.

That is not to say that there are not elements to enjoy in this third entry in the JP franchise. In fact, this entry is infinitely more painless than the Spielberg-directed atrocity The Lost World.Having realized that Jeff Goldblum's Ian Malcolm served better as a supporting character than a lead, this entry thankfully brings back the reliable Sam Neill as paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant. Grant is more than happy to have left the denizens of Jurassic Park behind and to return to the excavation of fossils. Unfortunately, he is plagued by funding woes and curiosity seekers. Fate seems to smile on him and his student assistant Alessandro Nivola in the guise of a wealthy married couple, William H. Macy and Tea Leoni, who claim to have gotten permission to fly over the island and want him to act as a tour guide for an exorbitant fee.Naturally Neill can hardly decline, and naturally the couple have misrepresented themselves. To cut to the chase, the ragtag group end up trapped on the island simultaneously looking for escape as well as any sign of Macy and Leoni's young son, Trevor Morgan, who was previously stranded there.Among the improvements from the last sequel are the return of Neill to the lead. It never did make any sense why a chaos theoretician with no knowledge of dinosaurs would lead an exploration a la The Lost World. It is also nice to see Laura Dern back albeit in a glorified cameo appearance. The visual effects continue to amaze and we get the introduction of some fascinating new creatures (the spinosaur and the pterodactyls). The film also develops the rapters in a rather intriguing direction, although it never completely fleshes it out. There is also a truly breathtaking moment aboard a boat on a river with a brachiosaur leaning forward. The film is refreshingly short and sweet, literally flying past.On the down side, the brevity does not allow much time for development. Director Joe Johnston moves things along at a healthy clip, but the tone he sets for the film is oddly light and sorely misses the tension that Spielberg brought to the original (although even Spielberg failed to bring that to the next installment). Additionally, while Johnston has a workmanlike grasp of action sequences, none of the subsequent set pieces seem as exciting as the initial plane crash and attack by the spinosaur. Another problem is that there are so few people on this adventure that it becomes fairly obvious early on who is not going to make it, and said characters are eliminated ridiculously early into the adventure.Another thing is that the new characters as a rule fail to bring much to the film. Macy and Leoni alternate between mild amusement and annoyance as the estranged couple searching for their son. I have yet to figure out why the series feels compelled to shoehorn a kid on each on these jaunts - it fit fine in the original, while not at all in its sequel. That said, Morgan is at least competent and not the embarrassment of Vanessa Lee Chester in the prior film. The late Michael Jeter seems almost laughably miscast as the mercenary leader. Nivola is the exception to the rule here. His character ostensibly has a reason to be included in the action and has as close to a character arc as the film allows. He is sexy, believable and always seems on the verge of breaking out into something stronger, but the film never truly allows it. On a side note, I have a sneaking suspicion that the fate of his character was altered to accommodate how well he connects in the role compared to some of his co-stars.In the end, this is an enjoyable, visually entertaining romp that is a marked improvement over the prior entry, but lacks the punch of the original. Hopefully, there is another sequel looming somewhere in the future that will allow the action to step completely away from the isolation of the islands and which does not feature Vince Vaughn.

The road there, and how it all plays out, is pure movie magic.Right from the start, you know this is going to be an essential. The three men, slowly walking towards each other, then opening the door, BANG BANG BANG... then the Ugly, with his twisted expression and meat in hand, mid jump. Then an epic plot begins to unfurl, and yes, GBU is very epic in every sense of the word, and exceeds its predecessors in every way.The plot of this film is less straightforward than in the previous installments. There are now three characters that demand your attention, and they're all after the same thing. It's like the best treasure hunt ever. While in the other Dollars movies the first 25 or so minutes are cloudy and require lots of thinking to comprehend what's happening, GBU lays it all out to see the whole way through. Filled with great fights, battles and a very tense conclusion, the Good the Bad and the Ugly's story will grab your attention for its 3 hour runtime.I didn't like that Clint had to share the spotlight in A Few Dollars More. But here, it's not only acceptable, but exceptional because of who and what he shares it with. Lee Van Cleef expertly handles the ruthless Angel Eyes, who will do whatever the job as long as he is paid. Eli Wallach becomes Tuco, the crazy bandit whose only allegiance is to himself and his money, and Clint plays Blondie, the 'good guy' , who fights for himself, cash, and whatever else he feels like. 3 standout, differentiated characters, each with names other than their respective actors. It may not be a big deal to you, but I like each character's nicknames.Each character is deep and layered, with moral haze that leads to some very intense scenarios. Who will betray who, and when, is asked by the viewer several times during the run of the film. The characters stand out, and a very well acted.As usual, the music is perfect, drawing from the earlier Dollars movies and creating a new score. It perfectly sets the tone.

In fact, it is the closest thing I've seen since the Godfather to be considered by me as a perfect film the plot, characters, music, camera-work and ending are sublime.

It was only a few years later in my young life that we were doing those duck and cover drills in the basement of my parochial school, knowing that we'd be safe if ever the big one dropped out of the sky. Personally, I knew I'd be safer by running across the baseball field to my house, calculating that I could beat a bomb dropped out of a plane so high up in the air. The prospect of Them evolving into humanity's final doom never crossed my mind, but I was too young to have had such an impressionable idea planted in my brain.Now I've seen this movie before, and doubtless will watch it again, but oddly, this is the first James Arness picture I've watched since he passed away a week ago as I write this. It would only be a year or so later that Marshal Matt Dillon would take to the airwaves as one of TV's first, most popular Western lawmen. He gives a hint of his understated star power here as the FBI agent Bob Graham, and to the script's credit, he didn't have to get all starry eyed over the obvious romantic interest, Dr Pat Medford (Joan Weldon). I certainly didn't associate her Pop Harold (Edmund Gwenn) with the venerable Kris Kringle of 1947's Miracle on 34th Street, but I have to say, he did a fine job as the probing scientist getting to the bottom of those nuclear inspired mutations.Considering the type of film this was, I was impressed with the studious vocabulary offered by the principals. I now know that formic acid is a venom naturally found in ant stings, and a myrmecologist is a scientist who studies ant societies. That along with the term aphonia meaning an inability to speak, as characterized by the young Ellinson girl (Sandy Descher) in a particularly impressive performance. I wonder how she managed to maintain that catatonic trance, interrupted only by her repeated hysterical exclamation of the horror that was - Them, Them!!! Well, I'm not enough of a film history buff to know if this is the picture that started it all in terms of mutant monster flicks, but it was certainly one of the earliest. Closely followed by Godzilla a couple of years later, the genre seemed to hit it's peak around 1958\/1959 with such gems as The Fly, The Wasp Woman, The Giant Gila Monster, and Attack of the Giant Leeches. They didn't all rely on Cold War hysteria to attain their status in cinema history, but heck, who needs it when you've got a giant hairy insect as your star.
