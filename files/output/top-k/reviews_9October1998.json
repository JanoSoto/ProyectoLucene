I had never been able to watch a whole movie with him playing in it. However I had hopes knowing that Peter Weir (Witness, The Mosquito Cost, Dead Poet Society etc.) directed the film. I also heard praises about the film.Well, I watched this film all the way, and actually I had fun during the second half of it. The ideas were really promising, and  the film had some moments, but the first part soap was far too long. People do not go to a cinema to watch daytime TV. It lacked acting too. The characters were playing soap actors and there is not much fun to watching that. And Jim Carrey, who supposed to be the real person in the show was no different from them. Sorry, this guy just cannot form a character because he is a bad actor. Weir should have noticed it since he had directed actors like Harrison Ford and Robin Williams before. Carrey's performance really hurt the film. No wonder the moment Ed Harris, who did a great job realising the allmighty producer of the show, started to dominate the film it got much better. But on the whole this film belongs to the group of movies you can write a lot about because of the ideas behind them, but you don't want to see them for the second time. In film-making it is fine to have great ideas and be able to talk about them, but if when you have to go out you cannot make them really work then you missed the point.

Spielberg intentions was for the viewer to experience the war, as well as can be done in a film,  from a soldiers standpoint.  How many boring moments do you think a soldier had to endure keeping watch for the enemy or snaking across the countryside?  Quite a few I suppose.  And just how chatty do you think war was?  I doubt soldiers spouted their life stories off to their fellow comrades.  And talking with WW2 vets, including my grandfather, the Germans, right or wrong, were nameless, faceless enemies.  I feel that these instances were portrayed fairly accurately in SPR.I feel this movie requires a second viewing.  It will give you a chance to remove  yourself from the violence and pay closer attention to other details.  Then compare your reactions.

And no, I'm not ten years old, I've been watching movies in theatres for more than 30 years. This film can be compared to great films like The French Connection and The Getaway with Steve McQueen. Unlike a lot of recent films (like the last ten years) the chase scenes in Ronin don't have any cars flying 30 feet into the air and there are not 200 cuts to artificially speed up the action scenes. Most of the action, acting, and character inter-actions are very realistic. A real plus is that a lot of the chase scenes are shown from the point of view of the people in the cars (eye level, first person.) If you are extremely motion sensitive you may not want to watch this film in a theatre. If, however, you like to ride roller-coasters you will probably want to see this film at least two or three times. Personally, I can't wait to see it again.

That would explain the delusional nature of his world. Is he trapped in some awful nightmare? Is his world insane because he's insane, or because he, alone, is sane?

One may wonder about the degree of Terry Gilliam's imagination. He takes three great novels (1984 by George Orwell, The Trial and The Castle By Franz Kafka) and creates an incredibly dark and pessimistic tale with a beautiful sense of humour. At the same time he also references several movies (Third Man, The Trial, Battleship Potiemkin). Jonathan Pryce is brilliant as the anti-hero. Since I'm already on the subject I might as well recommend Orson Welles' The Trial, which is equally dark and visually brilliant.

Set in a cold, bitterly sterile environment by Cronenberg, Irons is able to work his mastery in dual roles as two brothers whose ties are deeper than anyone can imagine.Dead Ringers is so eerily put together, that the viewer at once feels trapped into a claustrophobic life with the Mantle brothers, and there is no outlet.  The film delves into a few themes, the two most interesting being the relationship between two identical twins, and where people go where there is no way out.  The Mantles are so close that they suffocate one another, and communication and caring with anyone else is not only much less in comparison, but it feels so 'other' that it can't ever seem to work. This leads to the feeling that they are so self-contained that there is almost no point in exploring the outside world, if not to feel pain...and pain they do find.The movie can be difficult to watch at times, as it puts the viewer in an unpleasant state through much of the story, however, it does not overwhelm the positives put in place by a strong script and a meticulous directing job.  That in mind, what makes Dead Ringers so worthy, and so hard to step away from--even after its conclusion--is Irons, who gives one of the great acting performances in all film.
