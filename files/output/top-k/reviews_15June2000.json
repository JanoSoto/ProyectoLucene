I first saw this film 6 years ago, and purchased it for the unbelievably low price of $9.99 this year.The cast of this film definitely made the difference.  I was particularly impressed by the late great Jim Varney (made famous by the Ernest movies).  I also liked Mr. Drysdale (Dabney Coleman), Elly May (Erika Elinak), and Jethro (Deidrich Bader).  Of course, I also think Miss Jane Hathaway was classic (Lily Tomlin).  Comparing it to the old TV show, Miss Jane was different.  In the movie, she didn't seem quite as uptight as the TV character was.  I'm not really sure though if she was attracted to Jethro on the show, but I also don't really want to know.Bader playing Jethro was classical.  My mother told me how the guy who originally played him on the show also played Jethrine, but he was so big that he didn't really look too much like a woman, just a big busty man.Some classic scenes  When the Clampetts arrive in Beverly Hills, they meet up with a guy who gives them the finger, and they reckon its the California Howdy, and flash it to everyone.  When they are in a police lineup, and Zsa Zsa Gabor is also in it, accused of a drive by slapping, and Mr. Drysdale passes out.  then Jane waves money in front of his face shouting, Speak to me! Say something! and he comes to and says YOU'RE FIRED!  The wrestling scene when Elly May does the Hickory Nut Crunch on that kid was also funny.This film did not lack any dragging points and was quite funny.

The save-the-planet plot is great, but the little subplots or character personalities makes it somewhat unrealistic. The actors do a good job of depicting the people that the story calls for, but they're a little more off the wall than what is believable.Why is it any time a Hollywood movie has to put together a group of ordinary, hard working, regular joes (men) they have to have weird and out-in-leftfield personalities. This is the case in this movie. Not to give away part of the movie, but I find it surprising that in the days before actual liftoff that none of the guys quit or kills himself, as is the case most of the time when real people are thrust in such a demanding spot.Bruce Willis is very believable in his role and made me cry when he had to. The plot twisted very nicely and the special effects were adequate in making me believe in the rock in outer space. Billy Bob Thorton did a good job and I am gradually gaining respect for his ability as he seems to have just appeared over the last few years. The actor who was the pilot of Bruce's shuttle did an exceptional job in projecting his character, and the unhearlded role of the cosmonaut, who is a major factor in the movie is great. Ben Affelat was somewhat lame, but that could have as much to do with the way his character was written than with him. His love interest in the movie did her part as the ungrateful and big-headed daughter who eventually but too late turns around returning her love for her father. Never knew how important the word Daddy was till this movie.Worth seeing and the bigger the screen the better. Great popcorn eating movie. Would discourage being drunk when watching it cause one could get a headache or worse from some of the rides.

Well. maybe!The film basically is set in the 80's and tells us about the character Patrick Bateman, a guy who seems to be losing control of himself and is killing lots of people! Moving away from the basic premise. no wait, that's pretty much it! So the plot is very thin, but there's more to this then you might think.Patrick Batemen is a Wall Street broker who never really seems to be busy. He has a girlfriend Evelyn (Witherspoon), a very classy apartment, takes frequent trips to exclusive restaurants, and has an average business card. Bateman also has another side to him, this being killing people when he has the time, and he has a lot of it! Christian Bales performance is outstanding as we're invited to look into Patrick Batemens life, someone who is out of control with his life and losing himself, yet he still manages to get away with it by showing himself as the guy you see going to work.

The Gods Must Be Crazy is a South African made comedy that was made back in the early 1980s but didn't get released until 3-4 years after shooting was completed. It became a surprise hit in the U.S. after it was released in 1984, and it did very well in other countries too. The Gods Must Be Crazy features three separate stories that get tied together towards the end. One story is about a bushman who goes on a journey to return a Coke bottle that he found to the Gods after the bottle starts causing harm to some of his family members. Another story revolves around a war that breaks out in Central Africa. And the other story centers around a clumsy scientist who tries to take a pretty South African woman to her new job as a schoolteacher in a small African village, and does everything wrong. This is my favorite part of the movie. The scientist is played by Marius Weyers, and he gives an inspired slapstick comedy performance. Some of the things that he does in the film had me exploding in laughter. The scenes with the jeep that he drives are priceless. Sandra Prinsloo is a good foil as the schoolteacher who unfortuneitly has no choice but to put up with his clumsiness. When Weyers and Prinsloo are on screen, The Gods Must Be Crazy is at its funniest. The other two stories are good, but not great.

But the movie is also very original. It's appropriate that the word crazy is in the title because this is the craziest movie I've ever seen. The Gods Must Be Crazy is a South African made comedy that was made back in the early 1980s but didn't get released until 3-4 years after shooting was completed. It became a surprise hit in the U.S. after it was released in 1984, and it did very well in other countries too. The Gods Must Be Crazy features three separate stories that get tied together towards the end. One story is about a bushman who goes on a journey to return a Coke bottle that he found to the Gods after the bottle starts causing harm to some of his family members. Another story revolves around a war that breaks out in Central Africa. And the other story centers around a clumsy scientist who tries to take a pretty South African woman to her new job as a schoolteacher in a small African village, and does everything wrong. This is my favorite part of the movie. The scientist is played by Marius Weyers, and he gives an inspired slapstick comedy performance. Some of the things that he does in the film had me exploding in laughter. The scenes with the jeep that he drives are priceless. Sandra Prinsloo is a good foil as the schoolteacher who unfortuneitly has no choice but to put up with his clumsiness. When Weyers and Prinsloo are on screen, The Gods Must Be Crazy is at its funniest. The other two stories are good, but not great. Nevertheless, there are some unusual scenes in these parts of the movie too. But the scenes involving the scientist and the schoolteacher are the best parts of The Gods Must Be Crazy.

I only wish they focused more on his character.  He was like Darth Maul in Star Wars where you knew he was a bad guy, but you really were hopping he would tear more things up.  I also like Randy Travis he made feel like he had been traveling the road for many years and had been there, done that.  I look forward many more wonderful performances by him in the up coming future. Patrick Swayze also did a great job.  He had the presence of a man who has spent some time in jail.

Wisely not even trying for an exact likeness, his interpretation of that so-familiar physicality is uncannily evocative.  From the very start, the characterisation is spot-on - the jut of the lower jaw, the growly voice, the rounded shoulders.  Once the viewer has adjusted to the initial shock, Hopkins IS Nixon.  It ceases to be an issue.Theodore Roosevelt, Washington, Kennedy and (most of all) Lincoln look down from the White House walls at Nixon, their solemn portraits hovering like admonishing ghosts over the Watergate squalor.  In life, Roosevelt was bold and self-assured, whereas Nixon dithers Washington's self-effacing propriety confronts a Nixon who is suggesting that the Nazis were right. Kennedy is everything that Nixon could never be - above all else, at ease with himself.  Lincoln looks down, from the office wall and from his marble seat in the Memorial, in silent rebuke as his successor debases the presidency.Some of the camera tricks don't work.  We see Nixon rooted to the spot at Love Field as the camera soars up and away from him.  Why?  Obtrusive camera movement is justified only if it adds to our understanding of character or plot.  This shot seems to have been included merely for its cleverness.  The same is true of the little flashes of black-and-white which keep interrupting the action.  At one point, in a dialogue between Nixon and Haldeman, the focus is un-subtly and repeatedly thrown from one man to the other.  What does this achieve?  Is some artistic goal being pursued, or are the effects included for their own sake?  What is the symbolic importance (if any) of the vanishing racehorses?Much of the attention to detail is of a very high order.  Stone's writing team has done its homework, and we get authentic touches such as Nixon's love of log fires, which meant having to run the White House air conditioning system at full blast during summer.  The reconstructions of the White House interiors are superb.  We see Nixon and Pat engaging in a domestic scrap beneath murals of more edifying battles like Yorktown and Saratoga.  Historical events, recorded on news film at the time, are brilliantly reconstituted, replacing the real Nixon with the Hopkins version.  Thus we get convincing reconstructions of the Kennedy TV debate and the 1962 'retirement' speech.  Young Nixon's courtship of Pat is narrated without dialogue as a grainy, jumpy home movie - and is beautifully done.  I did not feel quite so positive about the Alger Hiss segment. Welles did this 'newsreel flashback' idea in Citizen Kane more than half a century earlier, and did it with such flair that anything which follows is sure to look jaded.  It also seemed to me that this passage is badly-placed, coming immediately after the 1962 California defeat.James Wood plays Bob Haldeman, and does his usual admirable, photogenic best.  My quibble with the characterisation is, this isn't THE Haldeman. The historical personage was grimmer, more stately, more formidable (Fred Emery's Watergate bears this out).  Wood is restricted here to the role of an aide, rather than the Chief of the White House Staff, an emperor within his own (not inconsiderable) domain.Pat Nixon does not ring true either, but for different reasons.  Joan Allen is more than competent as the steely, astute power behind the Nixon throne.  The fault is in the characterisation rather than the actor.  The real Pat was (so far as one can judge) an altogether less articulate, less philosophical, less knowing individual.  Watch her in the REAL Checkers broadcast - she is a stiff, repressed, passive woman, a true 1950's Republican wife, not the power broker that this film would have us believe. It is hard to accept, for example, that Nixon's decision to retire in 1962 was his wife's diktat.There are elements of this otherwise excellent film which simply don't work.  Would the President of the United States REALLY be pulled out of a face-to-face meeting with Brezhnev to deal with some Watergate minutiae? The real-life Mitchell said that he tolerated Martha's indiscretions because I love her.  This touching declaration is cheapened in the film, for no good reason.  Similarly, Tricia Nixon's exchange with her father was, in real life, an assertion of unconditional loyalty which was both moving and very much to Nixon's credit.  The film version has her asking sceptically, Did you cover up?  This is quite wrong.  The Nixon women would have considered it treachery even to frame such a question.John Williams' epic score is in keeping with the classical tragedy acted out before us.  Nixon's tearful prayer with Kissinger and the farewell speech to the White House staff are scenes of extraordinary power.Paul Sorvino gives us a marvellous Kissinger, though in my humble opinion Stone goes too far when he makes Kissinger the White House 'leaker' and accuses the Secretary of State of complicity in the Watergate break-ins.One scene which works splendidly is the (true) incident at the Lincoln Memorial.  Nixon tries to glad-hand the indignant youngsters, using the hearty, patronising approach of a bygone generation.

Welles did this 'newsreel flashback' idea in Citizen Kane more than half a century earlier, and did it with such flair that anything which follows is sure to look jaded.  It also seemed to me that this passage is badly-placed, coming immediately after the 1962 California defeat.James Wood plays Bob Haldeman, and does his usual admirable, photogenic best.  My quibble with the characterisation is, this isn't THE Haldeman. The historical personage was grimmer, more stately, more formidable (Fred Emery's Watergate bears this out).  Wood is restricted here to the role of an aide, rather than the Chief of the White House Staff, an emperor within his own (not inconsiderable) domain.Pat Nixon does not ring true either, but for different reasons.  Joan Allen is more than competent as the steely, astute power behind the Nixon throne.  The fault is in the characterisation rather than the actor.  The real Pat was (so far as one can judge) an altogether less articulate, less philosophical, less knowing individual.  Watch her in the REAL Checkers broadcast - she is a stiff, repressed, passive woman, a true 1950's Republican wife, not the power broker that this film would have us believe. It is hard to accept, for example, that Nixon's decision to retire in 1962 was his wife's diktat.There are elements of this otherwise excellent film which simply don't work.  Would the President of the United States REALLY be pulled out of a face-to-face meeting with Brezhnev to deal with some Watergate minutiae? The real-life Mitchell said that he tolerated Martha's indiscretions because I love her.  This touching declaration is cheapened in the film, for no good reason.  Similarly, Tricia Nixon's exchange with her father was, in real life, an assertion of unconditional loyalty which was both moving and very much to Nixon's credit.  The film version has her asking sceptically, Did you cover up?  This is quite wrong.  The Nixon women would have considered it treachery even to frame such a question.John Williams' epic score is in keeping with the classical tragedy acted out before us.  Nixon's tearful prayer with Kissinger and the farewell speech to the White House staff are scenes of extraordinary power.Paul Sorvino gives us a marvellous Kissinger, though in my humble opinion Stone goes too far when he makes Kissinger the White House 'leaker' and accuses the Secretary of State of complicity in the Watergate break-ins.One scene which works splendidly is the (true) incident at the Lincoln Memorial.  Nixon tries to glad-hand the indignant youngsters, using the hearty, patronising approach of a bygone generation.  The sad revulsion of the protesters shows the gulf between Nixon's consciousness and the spirit of the age.I hope I haven't let you down is uttered one single time by Nixon, towards the end of the film.  The truth is, he hit on this formula of words and used it again and again during the final days of his presidency.  It was a last desperate attempt to tweak our sympathy-nodes.  As such, it was utterly gauche, utterly craven, utterly guileful, yet utterly unrealistic. In fact, utterly Nixon.

These films are universal, you cant say anything bad about them, and if you do, you have NO imagination or heart.Okay, Im going to attepmt to explain SW to you.Star Wars is for many reasons the greatest of all films because1.Its a mythological story set against the biggest backdrop we know of, Space! Its a story of heroes and villians, princesses and wizards. The film is just full of mysticism.2.It makes you feel purefied after watching one, you feel as if you dont want to leave this place, you want to stay and see what happens. You cant seem to let it go. You cant help but feel good about yourself after watching one of the SW films. If you dont understand this, you have no heart. I dont care what you say, but thats the truth.3.The Special Effects in this film hold up to even The Phantom Menace. It set new boundaries for how stories can be told and as allowed people to fully express there ideas by creating new F\/X technologies.4.George Lucas is the greatest storyteller of all time. Yes, he is. You know it. He's got to be the only person to fully captivate the world with his vision. No other work of art as ever done that.5.This is what films are about.

She has taken a high-profile job with the Nakatomi Corporation and the party is being held at the unfinished new tower for the company. Things seem to be going alright when disaster strikes. Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and a team of professional German terrorists have hijacked the building. All entrances are sealed, the tower is patroled by well-armed guards and they are planning to get away with millions of dollars in bonds stored in the building's high-security vault. They have complete control, except for one unforseen factor........John McClane.As the film progresses, McClane finds himself the unlikely hero (with no shoes on) who must single handedly overpower Hans' team with only his stealth, wits and a little bit of ingenuity. He is not a machine he is just a cop who won't quit. And the movie is a thrill machine that won't quit.Bruce Willis, Bonnie Bedelia, Alan Rickman and the entire cast are terrific. The screenplay gives plenty of humor to lighten up the proceedings too. The stunts and direction are superb. This movie is everything one would want in a summer flick.Trust me if you haven't seen this movie, run out and rent it now. If you haven't seen it or it's two sequels, pick them up too. Die Hard is the ultimate action film real people, real characters, real humor, real excitement and suspense and real fun.Now why dont they make movies like this anymore.........??

The movie doesn't make a good attempt to incorporate the fabulous universe created for it into the story very well, instead just trying to wow us with visual effects, and the fact that the plot only focuses on several characters in their quest to save humanity, while the rest of the humans are completely oblivious to the struggle going on, denies the film the epic feel that it strives for.  The heavy-on-action, light-on-character plot doesn't help much either. In fact, this story doesn't stand up to any analysis of its plot at all. The more I tried to think about what was going on, the more I was confounded by all of the holes in the story.  It's hard to explain all of the problems without giving away the end of the movie, but I'll simply say that it seems like no one stopped to think about all of the contradictions and impossibilities presented in the story.  In case you really want to know, I'll give you just a few examples of some of the many problems, BUT THESE ARE ***SPOILERS***, SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW, DON'T READ THIS 1) No effort was taken to explain how Cale managed to escape from the Drej prison just by sticking his hands through the wall (did I miss something or what?). I know that they are creatures of `pure energy' and that the cell was the same way, but it still doesn't make any sense.  2) Why didn't anyone (Preed and Korso excluded) on the crew of the Valkyrie care when Akima and Cale ran away? Didn't they think about the fact that their crewmates had mysteriously left without saying goodbye, that Korso all of a sudden became a mean and nasty guy, and that they were ordered to secretly follow Cale and Akima and were not to contact them.  3) What ever happened to Cale's father?  Did he successfully leave with the Titan or what?  Why was the Titan deserted when they finally found it, and how did Cale's father die?  4) Finally, what threat did the Drej ever see in the humans that convinced them to attack earth?  Since they are pure energy, they essentially cannot be destroyed anyway (one of the Drej soldiers grows back an arm that was destroyed). These are just some simplified explanations for problems that I could analyze in much more detail, and I'm sure that if you've seen the movie and think about it, you can easily realize that there are all sorts of other plot inconsistencies.  ***********END OF SPOILERS************ What about the animation?  It is, after all, an animated movie.  Here, it does a better job, but there are still a few annoyances.  The movie looks great.  A good job was done of putting the cell and CG together so that it didn't look out of place, and the movie was definitely visually stunning. But that, ironically, also led to another of the film's shortcomings. This is that the film relies entirely too much on visual gimmicks that get old and don't do anything to advance the story.  The first time the camera circled around one of the characters, I was impressed.  But after it had happened several times for no particular reason, I got annoyed at how blatantly the animators were trying to impress me just by showing me a pointless visual trick.  The moving shots were unnatural and unnecessary, and presented so often that they lost their initial visual appeal.  The space sequences were overused in a similar fashion.  By trying to make every single space shot as cool as possible, they actually made the ones that should have been exciting less impressive than they would have been had we not seen so much before them.  The character animation is very good.  As an Animator myself, I am always impressed by nice animation, but I also get suspicious when animation looks TOO realistic.  I checked the credits at the end of the film, and sure enough, there was a (rather large) section titled LIVE ACTION REFERENCE.  The vast array of actors, cameramen, and jib operators listed in this section made me suspect that portions of the movie had been rotoscoped.  For those of you who do not know what rotoscoping is; it is a term that refers to filming real life actors going through the motions of the characters in the film, then tracing the images of the actors onto the cels and painting the characters over them.  The reason it looks so realistic is because real actors are providing the motions.  I'm not absolutely sure, and if it wasn't rotoscoped at all, I'm very impressed, but if it was, I'm very disappointed. I'm not completely negative about this movie.  One thing that I liked was that it was acceptable for that commonly-neglected demographic of kids between ten and thirteen years old.  I remember that when I was younger there wasn't very much in between G-rated kiddy films that I was embarrassed to go see and extremely violent and dirty PG-13 and R rated films that my parents wouldn't let me watch.  This film, although surprisingly violent for a PG movie, is acceptable for kids who like action but whose parents don't want their ears filled with profanity and other garbage.  And although I personally feel that they should have just gone all out on the film (you can tell that they really wanted to) and turned it into a PG-13 movie, I can understand that it would not have been a smart choice in America, where people think of animated films as children's entertainment.  While I personally didn't care that much for the film, I believe that it is a step in the right direction as far as animated films go, and I hope to see more films along this line in the future.

But when a movie is so good in some ways, and a let-down in others -- even a little -- it tears me up inside. It really does. Long story short, this movie has only two things wrong with it the story and the soundtrack. Visually, this movie is a knockout. The acting is great -- not a single casting mistake in the bunch. Characters, dialogue? Great, brilliant.  Even a couple of fairly accurate sciency scenes. But the story just doesn't add up. The overarching plot is that a bunch of evil aliens single out Earth and its inhabitants for destruction, apparently because we built something called the Titan Project, which is a device specifically designed to deal with the problem of what to do if Earth gets destroyed. How's that for cause and effect? Of course, the problem is that we don't really know why the aliens hate Earth so much, or why the main character decides to accept his destiny and fight for humanity, or why one of the characters turns traitor midway through the movie (oops, uh, SPOILERS!) or much of anything. It's all just sort of accepted that these guys are good, and these other ones are bad, and this one other guy was good but now he's bad but (SPOILER!) he turns good again just in time to save everybody and etcetera.

It's like they decided at the last minute to try and make this a musical. Seriously, the main character, a refugee from the destroyed planet Earth, is first introduced to us over the strains of a little number called 'Cosmic Castaway'.

I'd say it's like a Disney cartoon, except that Disney usually includes songs which at least attempt to be timeless, whereas these tracks are going to show up in a Not-Available-in-Stores-6-CD-Set-With-Free-Poster sometime before this film hits video.

First of all, I cannot recall another film made by artists I admire so much(Peter Weir, Robin Williams) that I detest this much. The moment this film tries to find a plot-- when Kurtwood Smith's character(Neil's father) argues with his son and asks, Why are you defying me, Neil? Is it this new man? This Mr. Keating?-- it sounds completely fake. Why would the father assume his teenage son is challenging him because of a teacher? How would he know which teacher to blame? This movie careens through manipulative scenes without ever stopping to really learn about its characters-- Knox's romance with a local girl is given so little screen time, it's absolutely pointless. John Keating's scenes in the classroom use literature as a source for empty sloganeering. That's a concert, not a classroom.But where the movie really fails its own ideals is in its treatment of the students as they begin to challenge the conventions of their supposedly oppressive private school. A movie that cared about them, and wanted to indict an authoritarian environment, would have a scene showing the school administrators leaning on a student, urging him to turn Keating over to save himself. Cameron, the turncoat character in this film, could have been written sympathetically-- he's an anxious wannabe with no friends, so, in a movie with some empathy, he'd be shown making the decision to rat out the group as a means to win his classmates over. Instead, he gets saddled with dialogue that makes him sound like a neo-Nazi, so that the audience can clap when Charlie punches him.At the end of this film, after all the exhortations from their teacher to challenge convention and conformity, these students face a choice. They all choose to lie to save themselves. Wouldn't a good film show its characters making difficult choices and daring to live with the consequences? Wouldn't a film that really cared about education show us characters that have actually learned something?
