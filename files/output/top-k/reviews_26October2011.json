(I tried to write DUM but the IMDb spell checker kept changing it to DUMB. I didn't think spell checkers were supposed to editorialize.)We then see a very butch Doris Day (or pretending to be butch) riding shotgun on a stagecoach making mechanical motions like a marionette. She starts singing the tune and the passengers inside the coach join in. Trouble is, the words are kinda goofy and the melody annoying. This is not looking like first-rate music. The further along this song goes, the worse it gets. Day's over the top acting is atrocious, and reminds me of a puppet from the Howdy Doody Show. When they get to town and she starts singing and talking some more, it just gets worse. OK, she's a tomboy, a woman trying to out macho the men, I get it, but she way overdoes it. And you are stuck watching this cloying performance for more than an hour before she finally mellows out a bit for a few minutes of the movie. If it weren't for her great looks and super singing, she wouldn't have gotten away with it.I've watched it at least twice now, but there are only two memorable songs, Whip Crack Away and Secret Love. I went back into it and was surprised by how much forgettable music there is. Secret Love is a classic, but the lyrics don't really fit with the story line, and the music is inconsistent with the rest of the faux cowboy tunes, so I assume it was written before the movie, and was looking for a home. The good part is there actually is a plot, (a formulaic mix and match romance plot) and the rest of the acting is good. But Day's performance is so bad and much of the music is so mediocre that there is little to recommend this musical. It could have been pretty good if Day's acting had been more nuanced and interesting, instead of a mechanical caricature. And how many times do we have to endure the same, Give me a sarsaparilla! joke? (Actually, in those days sarsaparilla was alcoholic, like beer.) I do love musicals, and don't expect them to be too realistic, but I don't like them to get too silly, either. I have seen Doris Day movies that I have enjoyed. Day demonstrated she could really act in Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much, not to mention sing. I have read that Calamity Jane, 1953, was a knock off of Annie Get Your Gun, 1950. In addition to better music, Annie had the fine director George Sidney, who had experience directing many solid musicals, including the first Western movie musical, The Harvey Girls. David Butler did not have this finesse, and the result, in my opinion, is an awkward film lacking style. Calamity Jane is not quite the stinker the opening scene suggests, and it is not awful. There are probably worse musicals out there, but I have never encountered one, and if I did, I wouldn't watch it. I find this corny movie so annoying that I think it's actually worth avoiding. There are much better musicals out there. If you want to see Doris Day in one, watch The Pajama Game. Music by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross includes Hey There, Hernando's Hideaway, Steam Heat, and plenty of other memorable numbers.

The plot seemed to go nowhere. It seemed as if Ford had no greater plan than to put all of his favorite actors onto a boat, and see if anything John Ford-like happens. To be honest, for the first hour, nothing much does. The show just drags on. But the second half makes up for the first. Fonda does some his finest acting, his soft mid-western drawl perfectly suited to a man who spends most of the film depressed and uncertain of his present and his future. And he plays some lovely and touching scenes with the crew of the ship towards the end. Henry Fonda will always be to me the great American actor.William Powell is gently awesome as well, playing a wonderfully jaded yet genial doctor, with his perfect enunciation of every line and elegant manners demonstrating the skills of this consummate actor. Yet he and Fonda in their many scenes together complement each other beautifully, rather that fight for attention.

It's a better constructed movie, with a better build-up to it, more slasher ingredients and a more insane and evil Chucky.Of course it's not a perfect movie and it isn't even all that great as an horror but I really enjoyed watching it. The concept of having a killer doll is of course a ridicules one but the movie makes great use of it. It does so by making Chucky this time even more evil and there are quite a lot of kills in this movie. And some pretty good ones as well, which is not something I could say about the first and original Child's Play movie, made 2 years earlier. In that regard this movie already works better as a slasher and horror movie than the first one ever did.But I also thought the story was way better this time, which caused the movie to flow better and more naturally. All of the kills and horror were pretty much forced into the first movie but in this movie it feels far more like it's a part of the story. No, it's not a brilliantly written story or even a very original one, it just simply allows the movie its pace and build-up to work out quite good and pleasantly.Another thing that really surprised me was its musical score. I don't even remember the first movie having a musical score at all but in this one it's pretty notable. Graeme Revell did a great job with it and it truly helps to make some of the movie its moments to stand out.One of the things that wasn't as good as in the first movie though was its acting. It stars the same young boy played by Alex Vincent again but in the first movie I was quite impressed with his performance, while in this one he's quite horrible to be honest. He never shows any emotions and pretty much has the same look on his face, throughout the entire movie. It doesn't matter if he's playing scared, sad, happy. or neutral. I don't know how this happened but perhaps it was because this movie got done by a different director. Maybe John Lafia just couldn't direct kids as well as Tom Holland.But overall I can see myself watching this movie over and over again, while I probably won't ever see the first movie again, any time soon.7\/10 http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"26 October 2011","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Call me crazy but I totally prefer this movie over the original.

No, he didn't inspire me to get off drugs. And he didn't swoop down in a suit of high tech armor and rescue me from The Unicorn. I did just watch Two Girls and a Guy and his performance is the only thing that kept this movie from being slit-my-wrists unwatchable. This is the sort of film that makes otherwise normal people hate independent cinema. It is dull and pretentious and phony and is the sort of New York City storytelling that even Woody Allen finds a little too self involved. Imagine Kevin Smith without a sense of humor, Quentin Tarantino without a sense of irony and Michael Bay without a drop of adrenaline. That's writer\/director James Toback in all his ignominy here.Here's the whole deal. Carla (Heather Graham) and Lou (Natasha Gregson Wagner) find out they've been dating the same guy for the last 10 months. When Blake (Robert Downey Jr.) returns to his insanely huge loft, they confront him and blather commences. They talk about hurt feelings. They talk about relationships. They talk about acting. They talk about Blake's mom. Carla and Lou talk. Carla and Blake talk. Carla, Blake and Lou talk. Blake and Carla have sex. Then they talk and talk and talk some more. But for all that chatter, the best scenes in the whole production are when Blake is talking on the phone to someone the audience can't hear. That's because only the awesome power of RDJ's talent is able to take this fake, unrealistic dialog and make it sound like something a human being would say.It's not that Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner are without talent. It's just that you don't need talent for this material. You need (trumpets blare)&#x85;TALENT!!!!!! Whenever Graham and Wagner open their mouths, they can't do anything but recite this crap. It doesn't sound like anything people would say. It's not structured like anything people would say. The motivations and behavior assigned to Carla and Lou by this script are as realistic and believable as the special effects in Plan 9 From Outer Space.Let me give you one example of what I mean and I'll only give you one for fear that remembering more of Two Girls and a Guy would send me into a self-induced coma of disgust and ennui.

Still, while I certainly knew this was going to take liberties with the story, I had no idea just how many, and how drastic they'd be. And please don't tell me I should have expected this because Burton's been doing it for years. I've seen plenty of Burton movies before, not all of them are dark slightly humorous Gothic macabre slashers. For every Sweeney Todd (which obviously is similar to this, but so is it's source material), there's a Big Fish.I knew the Horseman was actually going to be a killer, that wasn't a surprise.

Hmm, I notice there isn't any sunlight for the third scene in a row, I have a feeling it's going to be like this for the rest of the movie (suspicion later confirmed). Are we really going to pretend it's always cloudy just to set the mood? I hate it when people use techniques like that; if you can't create an oppressive gloomy atmosphere without washing the color and light out of everything don't bother. For a particular scene? Sure, but I know you can do it without easy tricks like that Burton. And of course in the very last happy 15 second scene in NYC the sun is shining bright; how symbolic! I cried with the utmost sarcasm.Next we were introduced to the Horseman himself via flashback. I'll not beat around the bush, I hated this depiction of the horseman. A superhuman Christopher Walken with the hair of a 17 year old snowboarder and freaking fangs? He looked like a strung out Troll Doll going through withdrawal. I won't deny I chuckled, Walken always amuses me and I figured this would be the only time we saw him since there is no actual ghost. I assumed Burton was just having a little fun with a one-off exaggerated flashback. I was mistaken.When it turned into murder mystery mode, I did begin to enjoy it again for a time. Once it became clear there were actually supernatural forces at work though, that the killer wasn't one of the townsfolk (not directly anyway), I'd just about had enough. The entire original story is about how people get freaked about by old wives tales when they're combined with spooky atmospheres, even though it's all fake, but now not only is the horseman actually killing people, he's actually a ghost too? As Cris Carter would say, C'mon man! None of this is to mention the dreadfully unnecessary and rather hokey special effects. In addition to all of the mind numbingly gratuitous beheadings (and seriously what was the point? We get it, you're not afraid to show some gore. It gets boring after the seventh time) there's also the completely random scene with a witch wigging out while acting as a medium. Did Sam Raimi stop by the set for a day? And while we're on the witches, whose bright idea was it to make Katrina an amateur sorcerer? So random. And the reason for the minister betraying his friend's trust is that he sacrifices his beliefs for lust with a witch? Where did you buy your book of clichés Tim?Oh well, I've certainly seen worse movies, but what a let down. I was very excited to finally see this, an esteemed director adapting one of my favorite childhood stories in a big screen treatment. He turned it from a delightful spooky little yarn about post-colonial America into a ridiculous over the top fantasy film about a serial killer chock full of cheesy effects.

After watching I honestly expected to come to the IMDb page and see a rather low rating and a page full of reviews wondering just what in the sam hill Burton was thinking.To be fair, I grew up loving The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, especially the impeccable Rabbit Ears version narrated by Glenn Close. Still, while I certainly knew this was going to take liberties with the story, I had no idea just how many, and how drastic they'd be. And please don't tell me I should have expected this because Burton's been doing it for years. I've seen plenty of Burton movies before, not all of them are dark slightly humorous Gothic macabre slashers. For every Sweeney Todd (which obviously is similar to this, but so is it's source material), there's a Big Fish.I knew the Horseman was actually going to be a killer, that wasn't a surprise. But the first shock came when we go to New York City. Ichabod Crane is a Renaissance inspired constable? Are you kidding me? The guy's supposed to be a timid bean-pole of a traveling school teacher. Whatever, roll with the punches I told myself.Cut to Sleepy Hollow. Hmm, I notice there isn't any sunlight for the third scene in a row, I have a feeling it's going to be like this for the rest of the movie (suspicion later confirmed). Are we really going to pretend it's always cloudy just to set the mood? I hate it when people use techniques like that; if you can't create an oppressive gloomy atmosphere without washing the color and light out of everything don't bother. For a particular scene? Sure, but I know you can do it without easy tricks like that Burton. And of course in the very last happy 15 second scene in NYC the sun is shining bright; how symbolic! I cried with the utmost sarcasm.Next we were introduced to the Horseman himself via flashback. I'll not beat around the bush, I hated this depiction of the horseman. A superhuman Christopher Walken with the hair of a 17 year old snowboarder and freaking fangs? He looked like a strung out Troll Doll going through withdrawal. I won't deny I chuckled, Walken always amuses me and I figured this would be the only time we saw him since there is no actual ghost. I assumed Burton was just having a little fun with a one-off exaggerated flashback. I was mistaken.When it turned into murder mystery mode, I did begin to enjoy it again for a time. Once it became clear there were actually supernatural forces at work though, that the killer wasn't one of the townsfolk (not directly anyway), I'd just about had enough. The entire original story is about how people get freaked about by old wives tales when they're combined with spooky atmospheres, even though it's all fake, but now not only is the horseman actually killing people, he's actually a ghost too? As Cris Carter would say, C'mon man! None of this is to mention the dreadfully unnecessary and rather hokey special effects.

I had previously seen bits and pieces of films like psycho, or the birds, but had never actually sat down and watched a Hitchcock film start to finish. If I only knew what I was missing. Everything about this film was great, the story, the misc-en-scene, the wealth of creative and interesting characters, as well as the subtle undertones of patriotism, or lack thereof. First is the story. Hitchcock wastes no time throwing the viewer right into the meat of the story, as the film's inciting incident, the death at the airplane factory, happens in the first five or so minutes of the film. From there, things only get better for the viewer, albeit much worse for the film's lead character. For me, two of the more enjoyable aspects of the film's plot came during the scene when Pat and Barry encounter the traveling circus. This scene is not only memorable for its obviously distinct characters, but also for the lessons that they impart on Pat and Barry. For instance, learning not to judge people, and giving everyone, regardless of their situation, a fair chance. Secondly, the scene with the blind man was also excellent because of the use of well placed lighting, music, as well as the twist at the end of the scene when the blind man reveals that he was aware of Barry's handcuff's all along. Just superb. From there, the film only gets better. Though the film is essentially designed as a mystery\/ suspense film, there were several parts that were genuinely funny. While Hitchcock might not have meant this to be the case, I thought the scene during Mrs. Sutton's ball was funny as well as vital to the plot. Additonally, the film touches on notions of patriotism and what people will do to meet their own ends. That aspect of the film, that is to say, the anti-patriotic parts, are what really struck a chord with me seeing as how this film was released shortly after America's entry into World War II. Finally, the overall look and feel of the film is great. I was taken aback but the scene early on in which the smoke from the factory fire begins to slowly billow in. I was floored by how visually arresting Hitchcock manages to make something as simple as smoke look stunning in the greater sense of the film. Overall, I would definitely recommend this film to anyone.

Vickie never committed any adultery, but Jake's obsession with feeling like something happened led Vickie to scream those words at Jake for his satisfaction.

Veda is such an extremely hate-able character because of her disregard of anything that is not deemed good enough for her. I believe that there is an underlying message in the movie money does not buy happiness. We see Veda's downward spiral fueled by her greed and selfishness, and in the end Mildred, the protagonist, work through her troubles and come out on top in the end.
