I hadn't seen the original but you absolutely don't need to; this incredibly stand-alone sequel tells you everything you need to know about the two leads, Riggs (Gibson) and Murtaugh (Glover) in the very first 15 seconds.I was absolutely blown away from the get-go and planted at the edge of my seat in the theatre the entire screening. Now, 21 years later and probably that many, or more, viewings, I'm still on the edge of my seat with excitement and awe in this fantastic film. In fact, this recent time I watched it, all the magic (SEE Movie Poster) was back and I couldn't help but clap in the closing on how much fun I had for the 21st time watching it.A lot of films advertise the multiple number of improvements in sequels in reference to the # in the series. For example, 2x The Action, Three times the Suspense, etc. This one, if I recall, did that obligatory 2x times the action, 2x the comedy, 2x the fun, or something like that. Though I liked the original Lethal Weapon, this did take everything to the next level. In fact, they elevated the magnitude of all that was right in the first one not by 2 but by ten.Though Pesci (Leo Getz) is a great and comedic addition to the gang (though no matter how many times I've seen this, I still can't follow his laundering money speech) with such classic lines like They F**K you at the drive-thru. *Repeat*, nothing beats the original members. Gibson is on top of his career as the rejuvenated lethal weapon from the first installment and Glover just goes along beautifully for the ride. You can sincerely see both having a blast, as if when they're laughing on screen and Director Donner yells cut, they continue rolling in laughter.The boys are back in L.A., this time researching the mysterious cougarans and the racist South African diplomatic immunity protected baddies while babysitting a state witness, Getz. The three cause city-wide chaos, uncover a mystery left open in the first Lethal Weapon and Riggs getz some. No, not with Pesci.Throw in some political statements (SAVE THE DOLPHINS!) which I literally hate when I see them either obviously or subliminally inserted in this series, and that's it. Really.I've heard that they had some rough outline of the script and the Director let the actors mostly improvise. So be it; this movie was hilarious, action-packed, deep, well paced, starts with a bang and ends on a justifiably tearful note. From beginning to climax, it's just one incredible scene after another and the writer\/director knew enough when to give us a break, but not for too long &#x96; just enough to get ready for more excitement\/humor.Oh, and the score's great, the soundtrack's wonderful George Harrison's Cheer Down, The Beach Boys's Still Cruisin' (After All These Years) and Eric Clapton's Knockin' On Heaven's Door are three of my all time favorites for movie music, the acting and even the over-the-top at times action sequences are believable and the lines were classic. 21 years later, I find myself quoting this movie, and most people I speak them to, know exactly what I am referring to, or can finish it for me.

I think its an incredible feat to even stay on the same playing field as what I consider to be one of the greatest films of all time. Toy Story 2 DOES stay on that playing field but it falls just a tad short of the original greatness and I can tell you why. The original cast all return which is amazing and the magic is still as strong as ever. The story focuses heavily on Woody with Buzz this time coming to his rescue and during Woody's adventure he finds a host of new toys, some that become a permanent part of the cast. The only issue I can take with this film compared to the first is the rest of the cast takes a back seat to Woody and his new companions. The cast is so amazing and the whole Toy box is so fantastic that you just lose something from the overall picture when they aren't at the forefront. The movie is still absolutely a must see and it is an integral part of the now trilogy. Much time is spent at Al's Toy Barn instead of adventuring from one place to another but the concept is still terrific.Tom Hanks and Tim Allen return to their brilliant roles as Woody and Buzz. No one could ever replace these two. They completely create their respective characters. Somehow the chemistry between their characters just isn't quite the same as it was in the first film. That's not to say it isn't good but they spend more time apart and I think you miss their comradeship. Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn (still amazing and hilarious as Rex), John Ratzenberger, John Morris, and Laurie Metcalf all return to their roles and I think it would change everything if they hadn't. Its a pleasure to see them back. Newcomers to the cast are downright brilliant. Estelle Harris is hilarious and brilliant as Mrs. Potato Head. Joan Cusack became an instant hit as Jessie the cowgirl. (I personally find her overdone and almost annoying but I know many love her.) Kelsey Grammar is the perfect voice for Stinky Pete the Prospector. My only regret there is that Pete isn't as good a villain as I would have hoped for (he's no lotsa---see Toy Story 3) but he's still good. Joe Ranft is adorable as Wheezy the Penguin, and voice actor expert Jodi Benson adds the perfect voice to the spunky Barbie. Wayne Knight is also a welcomed addition as the bumbling bad guy Al.So I think you can pick out from my review where I think the film makers stumbled just a little from the original amazing film but expectations would have to be absurdly high. Some of the highlights of this film include the discovery of the Buzz Lightyear aisle at Al's Toy Barn, which hearkens back to the original laughs of Buzz and his first appearance. Joining original director John Lasseter are two more Disney directors, one of whom will go on to direct the incredible Toy Story 3. Ash Brannon, and Lee Unkrich don't have a ton of directorial experience but I imagine if anyone could hone their skills Lasseter would be the perfect director to do it. Toy Story 2 does lack some of the heart of the original, and misses some of the comradeship from the first but Toy Story 2 is still a must see movie for kids and adults alike because the series as a whole is the most brilliant animation you could possibly see. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 July 2010","score":"","review":" I suppose I could argue all day why Toy Story 2 isn't on the same grand scope as the first film.

Toy Story 2 does lack some of the heart of the original, and misses some of the comradeship from the first but Toy Story 2 is still a must see movie for kids and adults alike because the series as a whole is the most brilliant animation you could possibly see. 8\/10 ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"4 July 2010","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" On the other side of the screen, it all looks so easy.It's all-out war inside a powerful corporate computer, as the evil Master Control Program and his villainous user hold sway over all the other programs that fall into their grasp.

This is unlike any character she'd played before. Not sultry or sexy, but bubbly and quite funny. But the real standout here is Nicolas Cage. His unusual voice is only one of the more brilliant things about his performance. Charlie has a whiny kinda high pitched voice which tells us a lot about his character even before we get to know him. But it's not just his voice, it's the heart he gives to his character that makes us see why the beautiful and popular Peggy Sue falls for him.The film also features great performances by Catherine Hicks and Joan Allen who play Peggy's loyal friends, Carol and Maddy. And it also introduces us to newcomers like Helen Hunt and Jim Carey, who are now household names. Also outstanding performances by Barbara Harris and Don Murray as Peggy Sue's parents.The rest of the cast is also great including Sofia Coppola as Peggy Sue's little sister Nancy, it's not much, but it's way better than her trainwreck performance in the Godfather III.Great direction by Francis Ford Coppola, who usually directs more serious stuff, but still makes an enjoyable comedy. If the film has any flaws it's perhaps in the script. Though there's great dialogue some of the stuff felt forced like when Peggy Sue visits her grandparents, and her relationship with Kevin J. O'Connor's character. It sometimes felt like they were trying to cram too many things together and the end felt a bit rushed and disjointed, but apart from that it's still a very good film and a very funny and effective comedy. It's definitely worth a watch.

Cinematography is dynamic and it keeps the pace(and intensity) high throughout, without reaching the point where we are overwhelmed or something didn't properly register with us. It is a 110-minute dirty, bumpy ride down a bad road, with the result that we can only seek to avoid the path, and deter others from following it, as well.

Humphrey is charming as always, Astor is compelling(you can sense that there's something to her role beyond the first impression she makes), Greenstreet is amiable(to an extent!), and this is Lorre at his sleaziest(without ceasing to be amusing).

This is one of those films that you hear you must take in at least once, so I was ecstatic to find this on sale. While I admit to overall liking The Big Sleep more than this(on account of Bacall, the romance and the relationship between her and Bogie... other than those three, they are amazing in all the same ways), this had me gripped throughout. I *love* noir, and this is one of the best of them, and required viewing for any fan of the genre. The femme fatales, and in general strong women, the funny, clever, sharp and swiftly delivered dialog, the editing and cinematography(the angles, the early pan onto the floor to reveal what it says on the window as the sunlight renders it readable there, and how incredibly *smooth* it all is) and the plot.

Unlike the others, it really goes for a big existentialist science-fiction theme, and I think it succeeds quite well. Okay it may be a bit pretentious, and yes it could do with some trimming, but it's a big story on a big canvas and cinematically it's terrific, a sort of midway point between 2001 A Space Odyssey and The Fifth Element.

The movie's detractors may argue that the lengthy effects sequences are boring but that misses the point - this is a film all about the wonder and majesty of the universe, and all the shots of the Enterprise, the endless heavens and the enigmatic energy cloud contribute to that. Besides, the effects by Douglas Trumbull and John Dykstra are simply sensational; some of the best model and matte shots ever created for film, as huge craft pan and tilt above us and we creep along bizarre, unfathomable vistas. Equally good is Jerry Goldsmith's loud fanfare of a score, with a fabulous trumpet main theme, driving strings, and weird electric guitar cacophonies - this was a particularly prolific period in his illustrious career and this is one of his very best suites.

Scarier and even more grim than How The Grinch Stole Christmas. The Country Bears are based on an attraction at the Disneyland Theme Park, but who thought a movie on these creepy bears would be a good film and declare it greenlight? I remember when this film came out I said it was scary and odd. But in 2010, I faced my fear and pressed play on this pathetic excuse for a film.If you've seen the bears in this movie, you know why this was panned. The bears are overwhelmingly fake and just cant be taken seriously. I believe that the technical effects were either CGI or just guys in suits. Either way, it looks appalling. Not one human cares that they are on the same floor as a bear. I'm waiting for the actor to just start laughing. How anyone, especially Christopher Walken can take this seriously is beyond me. This is a joke. Christopher Walken is a great actor, who's nice to see in a film, but he is just letting his career slip when doing crap like this and the 2006 Comedy Click.The plot involves Beary (voiced by Haley Joel Osment) a bear obviously who runs away, after learning he is adopted, to Country Bear Hall to see the band try and reunite the band he idolizes after a ten year absence. Country Bear Hall is going to be tore down by Reed Thimple (Christopher Walken). Beary is determined to get the band back together to once more hear their music, and to save Country Bear Hall.This plot probably wouldn't have pulled through for any other movie. The plot isn't special, we know they'll find a way to save it, and to top it all off, Country Bear Hall doesn't even exist so why care? But the fact that bears are the lead singers makes the film even worse. The imagination may have worked for a five year old kids dream or a thirty year old's nightmare, but an 88 minute movie watching bears prance around the stage singing cover songs is WAY too excessive. We should get a kick too on how Willie Nelson and Elton John state they got inspired by creepy talking bears. Did singing bears really inspire Willie and Elton to sing the spectacular songs they sing today? Who knows? Back to the Christopher Walken issue again, it's just an honest shame to see him waste his talents in an abysmal film like this. Its torture to watch a great actor do a poor job and play as someone he's not meant to play. Like Robert DeNiro in The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle. Its a mystery why no other well known actors were used. If you're going to ruin Walken's career, why not take on Nicholas Cage's? Robert DeNiro's career? Leonardo DeCaprio's career? Or do they know better not to be in a film with bears? Probably, anyone would.

Scarier and even more grim than How The Grinch Stole Christmas. The Country Bears are based on an attraction at the Disneyland Theme Park, but who thought a movie on these creepy bears would be a good film and declare it greenlight? I remember when this film came out I said it was scary and odd. But in 2010, I faced my fear and pressed play on this pathetic excuse for a film.If you've seen the bears in this movie, you know why this was panned. The bears are overwhelmingly fake and just cant be taken seriously. I believe that the technical effects were either CGI or just guys in suits. Either way, it looks appalling. Not one human cares that they are on the same floor as a bear. I'm waiting for the actor to just start laughing. How anyone, especially Christopher Walken can take this seriously is beyond me. This is a joke. Christopher Walken is a great actor, who's nice to see in a film, but he is just letting his career slip when doing crap like this and the 2006 Comedy Click.The plot involves Beary (voiced by Haley Joel Osment) a bear obviously who runs away, after learning he is adopted, to Country Bear Hall to see the band try and reunite the band he idolizes after a ten year absence. Country Bear Hall is going to be tore down by Reed Thimple (Christopher Walken). Beary is determined to get the band back together to once more hear their music, and to save Country Bear Hall.This plot probably wouldn't have pulled through for any other movie.

Kuato, the alien-baby stuck on a guys chest is the worst made puppet in the film. Chucky was more convincing in Child's Play two years prior to this movie.The air bursting through the windows where people live at the end look really bad.

Ronny Cox was so much better in Robocop.Michael Ironside is also wasted here. He was much better in Starship Troopers.Even the fun grotescue violence, that is Verhoevens trademark and the sometimes funny scenes can't save this crap.The way too obvious product placement made me sick. In two or three scenes, it becomes very clear what paid for this entire movie and Arnie's presumably very large paycheck.The only good thing about a movie that looks like a low-budget sci-fi today, is Sharon Stone. She was incredibly sexy and every time she appeared in a scene, me and my buddy started paying attention to the movie again, at least while she was on the screen. Why Arnies character, Quaid, would prefer Rachel Ticotin over Sharon Stone is a bigger and much more interesting mystery than whether or not the whole thing is a dream in Quaids head.And the plot does'nt make sense.

I actually enjoyed this one a lot more than expectations wanted me too. I enjoy watching silly, 90s Comedies about a duo (much why my favorite movie is Clerks, along with Black Sheep). Some people call it a dud and others say not that funny, but this will be the first positive review of the film I have seen (or read for that matter).I didn't know what to expect from the title, or the actors. I have never watched Pryor or Wilder in a movie (no, I haven't seen Willy Wonka). I have seen bits and pieces of Pryor's Comedy but when you put him in a movie where he plays a blind guy, he needs to be confused.Pryor plays Wally, who's blind and near clueless. Wilder plays Dave, deaf and doesn't want to admit it. Get the connection? When a shot is fired right in front of Dave's stand, neither one saw or heard what happened. Dave picks up the gun and now the police are after them for their fake murder. The duo are being chased as well by the people that actually committed the murder Eve (Joan Severance) and Captain Braddock (Alan North) who are on the hunt for a gold coin that Wally and Dave stole after finding it placed in their change drawer.The movie needs to be slow paced in order for the movie to catch up with the characters. Seeing as they are blind and deaf, the movie seems to be progressing faster then the characters. At points it feels that the movie wants to go faster, but since the characters are slow, the film needs to be slow.Still a funny movie in places, I think after seeing this, for their troubles, I think the blind and deaf are given maximum brain power to think more clearly. If thats not the case, excuse me because thats how they are portrayed in this movie.

Pixar's first release jump started the animation craze that has lasted nearly two decades and still going strong and gave birth to some of the biggest films of the last 15 years. So it should have been an easy choice for my 900th review with Toy Story craze back on with the new and equally as amazing third installment. Toy Story brings to life some of the greatest characters in film history. You will fall in love with all the characters within the first 15 minutes and makes every step of their fantastical adventure even more captivating. The adventure they go on when you look at it from a truth standpoint is no more than 'down the street' and back but when you're a 3-6 inch toy that changes everything and that is truly the brilliance of Toy Story. You will become one of these toys, their world is so real to you and you see everything from their perspective. Every single person on the planet had toys of one kind of another whether it be a stuffed teddy or a stick and watching Toy Story will make you fondly remember your childhood and look at every inanimate object we love in a different light.Tom Hanks is Woody. No one could ever take that away from him as is the case with many of the toys. Hanks is the soul of the good hearted, compassionate and brave toy cowboy. His voice is so incredibly animated and excited and just absolutely perfect. Tim Allen is as good as Hanks playing the role of everyone's favourite space toy Buzz Lightyear. The chemistry the film makers create between Buzz and Woody is phenomenal and probably one of the biggest reasons Toy Story remains so successful. If I could spend time on each and every voice actor in this film I would because this is without a doubt thee BEST voice acting cast in animation history. Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn (my personal favourite Rex), John Ratzenberger (simply amazing), and to a lesser extent but still amazing Annie Potts, John Morris (who was Andy in all three films spanning 15 years), Laurie Metcalf and the incredibly versatile character actor R. Lee Ermey. This entire cast created animation history. You will not find a better cast and considering they are all behind the scenes voicing fictional characters that is impressive.Director John Lasseter is not new to animation although Toy Story will certainly be considered his piece de resistance for certain. He has worked in various capacity on dozens of amazing Disney features but he obviously knows his characters, he obviously knows Disney and he obviously is in touch with the little child inside himself and all of us. Best of all Toy Story holds no punches. I would even hesitate to allow my young, young children to see the film before they were ready because there is truly some terrifying scenes in the film and some really creepy characters. Sid and his torturing of toys, and his rag tag band of creepy toy outcasts are downright creepy and make the story even more incredibly but could certainly creep out little children but the happy ending and the bright world of Andy's room and knowing that the Toys will win in the end brings everything together. If you hate cartoons, if you have never seen Toy Story you are short changing yourself because this film will make you realize animation is not your grand daddy's cartoons anymore. A brilliant amazing film that is probably one of the best ever made. 10\/10 THANKS FOR STICKING WITH ME THROUGH 900 REVIEWS AND ON TO 1000!! 901 and 902 WILL BE TOY STORY 2 AND 3 RESPECTIVELY.

The third movie in the Alien franchise and the film that almost signalled the end of David Fincher's directorial career before it had really begun.It was always going to be a tough one, how to please fans and give them a sense of closure (IF this was ever intended to be the final instalment) while following on from not only a classic original work but also from a sequel that managed to take things in a different direction while still maintaining an amazingly high standard, being equally good as the first movie for different reasons.So we get another very different affair that takes a very, very dark turn as our heroine, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), crashes onto the prison planet of Fiorina 161. A planet full of nasty, male prisoners who haven't seen a woman in a long, looooooong time. And a planet that now holds one more xenomorph than it used to. With no weapons and no macho marines to help, how will Ripley manage to defeat the monster this time around? There's the old argument about lack of creative control and decisions being made that lessened Fincher's vision but, let's be honest here, this movie was always going to be a tough sell and was always going to be a difficult one for the fans to handle. Viewed now, with the benefit of hindsight and an improved Assembly Cut on DVD (though no director's cut as Fincher has had no more to do with the project, to date), it's easy to overlook it's flaws and hail it as a great movie but it's still no classic and still pales in comparison to the instalments that came beforehand. I must say, however, that I love the darkness of the film and it's bleak atmosphere that infuses every scene from start to finish.The cast all do pretty well (and UK audiences, in particular, will enjoy seeing the likes of Ralph Brown, Paul McGann, Charles Dance and Brian Glover coming up against our nasty, alien foe) but, unfortunately, a few too many scenes still descend to the level of bald, angry men simply shouting at each other and running around corridors. Weaver is great, which goes without saying in the context of this series.Fincher will, hopefully, look back on this movie and realise that he did manage to overcome many of the problems in his way to provide audiences with a fantastic film that nobody was ready for at the time. It's enjoyable, stylish, dark and intelligent - pretty much the same as every other movie that Fincher went on to make in the rest of the nineties and beyond so fans of his work should still give it a look.
