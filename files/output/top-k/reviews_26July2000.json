[{"date":"26 July 2000","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Outside Providence.  ***1\/2. Timothy Dunphy (Shawn Hatosy) lives in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.  He's 17. He and his friends are stoners.  They hang out and argue the relative benefits of moving to California or staying in Pawtucket after high school.  Their criteria for deciding revolve around the potential quality and quantity of drugs and sex.  Dunphy lives with his dad (Alex Balwin) and his younger brother (Tommy Bone).  Dunphy gets in trouble. One of his dad's friends is connected and gets Dunphy's jail sentence deferred if he enrolls and successfully completes his senior year of high school at an exclusive prep school.  Dunphy moves from stoned fish in a small pond to fish out of water. His ensuing adventures are predictable but fun.  There is the geeky roommate, stoner pals, beautiful girl that's out of his league, and the Dickensonian schoolmaster.  I enjoyed most every moment.  No scene ever got too melodramatic or silly.  The stoner jokes and other one liners are funny.  Outside Providence plays as a very good 70s coming-of-age movie.  The writing credits for OP goes to Peter Farrelly of the Farrelly Brothers (There's Something About Mary, Kingpin, and Dumb and Dumber).  Given the Farrelly connection, I was surprised by the restraint and tenderness of this movie.  Very much worth the rental.

Outside of Alec Baldwin, who made a pretty decent Mr. Conducter, and Didi conn who is her usual perky self playing Stacey Jones, the rest of the acting is completely atrocious. Peter Fonda acts as if though he has just been awakened from a nap through the entire movie, and the children actors are just plain baaad.

Filled with great imagery (the Lisbon house and the sisters themselves among them), wonderfully shot, and surprisingly playful,  the movie also contains several nicely captured awkward moments, mostly whenever someone from outside the family attempts to talk to the sisters.

They're never completely anonymous, only distant.
