A classic book should be portrayed on film as close to the original as possible, leaving room for the necessary conversions of text to screen. That being said, there are exceptions to every rule, and this movie is one of them.I had not read the book prior to watching this movie, but had read IMDb reviews that it was far from accurate, so I was skeptical going into it. The movie, in fact, was outstanding! I was riveted, drawn into the story, and anxious to find out what happened next. It was fascinating and intriguing. I think the best comparison I can make with it is a Dickens story set about 150 years earlier than his books. It's dark and gritty, highlighting the lowlifes of society and the shortcomings of the society that contributes to make these lowlifes. Yet there is considerable irony and a bit of humor to counteract the darkness. Love, life, death, joy, grief, sickness, deprivation, aspiration.... It is in short a microcosm of life as it is today, but through the window of days past. One feels the emotions that the characters are experiencing, because they are feelings we've already experienced ourselves. However, although this movie is frequently tragic, it is not a tragedy. I could not recommend it so highly if it was, because I don't like to walk away from a movie feeling depressed. I liked the movie so much that I began reading the book that very night, and I finished it 8 days later. Where did the book differ from the movie? It would be easier to state where they resembled each other! I would have been hard-pressed to see any similarity between the two had they been published under different titles. For one thing, the book covers the title character's entire life up past the age of 60, whereas the movie only takes her up to maybe 30, and what goes on in that time frame is widely different from what goes on in the book.In the movie makers' defense, they do have in the opening credits the following caveat Based on a character in a novel by Daniel Defoe. Okay, so it's based on the CHARACTER of Moll Flanders, not on the story itself. That's a legitimate, though tiny-print, concept. However, even the CHARACTER of Moll Flanders in the movie is quite different from the book. One big digression (out of many) is that movie-Moll has strong paternal, motherly characteristics, whereas book-Moll has essentially none. Secondly, Moll's name isn't even really Moll in the book; it never tells us her real name, and Moll Flanders is merely one of her many aliases, and one that she doesn't pick up until her 50s.I can't possibly go into all the digressions. It would be boring and overextend the 1000 words limit. Suffice it to say, there is scarcely a shadow of similarity between the one and the other. If you have read the book, disregard the title and watch this as its own entity. If you haven't read the book, no need to worry about seeing any spoilers that might ruin a future reading. There is almost no overlap.However, in spite of this sin of gross inaccuracy, I LOVED the movie, and I thought the book was only mediocre. The movie had a great plot development; the book has almost no plot. It was first published in 1722 and, like much early fiction, is mostly just a chain of events. We are told the many escapades of Moll Flanders, but there is no real story arc. (I'm not saying don't read it, just know what you're getting into; it's interesting, but not terribly fulfilling as a novel, in the modern sense of the genre.) I was impressed with Robin Wright's performance (as Moll). I had thought little of her acting in Princess Bride, and almost didn't watch the film because she had the title role; but she did a much better job in this film, and showed a much fuller range of acting ability and emotion. The other actors also filled their roles superbly. And the settings and costumes were magnificently done.One thing that may affect your opinion of this movie is the content. By all standards I've ever watched, this ought to be R-rated. It's not extremely explicit (hence it is not in fact R), but it is considerably so for a PG-13, and I would be cautious showing this to young viewers. Not just for sexuality, but also for some rather graphic scenes (including blood) and overall mature themes.However, for a mature viewer I think this was a fantastic movie with a great storyline. It's very thought-provoking, and the impression of it still lingers with me a couple weeks later. The writers used Defoe's book as a springboard to better ideas and a more cohesive and rewarding story.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"29 June 2015","score":"","review":" If one reads the opening credits, shortly after the young Fanny climbs into the carriage at the beginning of film, you will find the words Based on the novel by Jane Austen, Mansfield Park, early journals and letters. Therefore the movie makers do indicate that this movie is NOT purely a book adaptation, albeit in small print. In truth, this movie is half Mansfield Park, half Becoming Jane.I would have been very upset with the film if I had not read the above-mentioned caveat (even having been fore-warned by IMDb users that this movie was highly inaccurate), but knowing this made the world of difference in understanding WHY they made the changes that they did.Fanny doubles up in character as Jane Austen herself, which is the biggest flaw in the plan, seeing as most interpretations of Jane portray a very independent woman--quite the polar opposite of Fanny Price. The problem is, the director or writer didn't quite make up their mind which way to portray Fanny\/Jane, so sometimes she is outgoing and feisty, and sometimes shy and submissive, so the character in the movie is very inconsistent.Edmund, Fanny's cousin, doubles up as Jane's beloved brother, Henry. Edmund falls for Mary Crawford; Henry Austen fell for his older widowed cousin Eliza de Feuillide, against the wishes of his sister Jane and the rest of the family. This coincides with Fanny disliking Edmund's affection for Mary, and also gives an excuse for picking an actress of whom my first impression was, She's too old to play Mary. And Fanny's unladylike playfulness with Edmund makes more sense in the light of how Jane likely behaved with Henry.Henry Crawford doubles up as Tom Lefroy, the source of some speculated flirtation in Jane's life, as well as Harris Bigg-Wither, the man from whom Jane accepts a proposal one day and retracts it the following morning. This is the reason why they make Fanny in the movie accept Henry Crawford and then decline him, even though in the book Fanny declines him consistently and emphatically. It was tempting in both cases to marry someone with financial competency. And I think the Tom Lefroy side of it is why they have Fanny engage in some verbal jousting and teasing with Henry Crawford and have her enjoying his company on occasion.Fanny's correspondent and best sibling-friend in the book is her brother William. Her sister Susan is substituted in this role in the movie to play the fill-in Cassandra, Jane's only sister and her confidante, frequently by extensive correspondence whenever they were separated.Other tie-ins to Jane Austen's life is that they have Fanny being an aspiring writer. Fanny writes a History of England, as Jane did in earlier years, and it appears that the lines Fanny says in the movie about some of the kings of England may be snippets from that writing. When Edmund refers to Fanny having a new modern way of writing, it is because she was parodying older history books. The other stories she concocts and relates to her sister appear to come from other pieces in Jane's Juvenilia.Understanding that the movie makers were combining fiction with biography made the digression from the novel's plot more understandable, but I think they should have taken more effort to make this apparent to viewers. No one in their right mind should put the title of a Jane Austen book on a movie that does not closely follow the story for fear of raising the hackles of the many purists out there (myself among them). It was an interesting idea they had, but not well-advertised enough of a concept to excuse themselves.

Therefore the movie makers do indicate that this movie is NOT purely a book adaptation, albeit in small print. In truth, this movie is half Mansfield Park, half Becoming Jane.I would have been very upset with the film if I had not read the above-mentioned caveat (even having been fore-warned by IMDb users that this movie was highly inaccurate), but knowing this made the world of difference in understanding WHY they made the changes that they did.Fanny doubles up in character as Jane Austen herself, which is the biggest flaw in the plan, seeing as most interpretations of Jane portray a very independent woman--quite the polar opposite of Fanny Price. The problem is, the director or writer didn't quite make up their mind which way to portray Fanny\/Jane, so sometimes she is outgoing and feisty, and sometimes shy and submissive, so the character in the movie is very inconsistent.Edmund, Fanny's cousin, doubles up as Jane's beloved brother, Henry. Edmund falls for Mary Crawford; Henry Austen fell for his older widowed cousin Eliza de Feuillide, against the wishes of his sister Jane and the rest of the family. This coincides with Fanny disliking Edmund's affection for Mary, and also gives an excuse for picking an actress of whom my first impression was, She's too old to play Mary. And Fanny's unladylike playfulness with Edmund makes more sense in the light of how Jane likely behaved with Henry.Henry Crawford doubles up as Tom Lefroy, the source of some speculated flirtation in Jane's life, as well as Harris Bigg-Wither, the man from whom Jane accepts a proposal one day and retracts it the following morning. This is the reason why they make Fanny in the movie accept Henry Crawford and then decline him, even though in the book Fanny declines him consistently and emphatically. It was tempting in both cases to marry someone with financial competency. And I think the Tom Lefroy side of it is why they have Fanny engage in some verbal jousting and teasing with Henry Crawford and have her enjoying his company on occasion.Fanny's correspondent and best sibling-friend in the book is her brother William. Her sister Susan is substituted in this role in the movie to play the fill-in Cassandra, Jane's only sister and her confidante, frequently by extensive correspondence whenever they were separated.Other tie-ins to Jane Austen's life is that they have Fanny being an aspiring writer. Fanny writes a History of England, as Jane did in earlier years, and it appears that the lines Fanny says in the movie about some of the kings of England may be snippets from that writing. When Edmund refers to Fanny having a new modern way of writing, it is because she was parodying older history books. The other stories she concocts and relates to her sister appear to come from other pieces in Jane's Juvenilia.Understanding that the movie makers were combining fiction with biography made the digression from the novel's plot more understandable, but I think they should have taken more effort to make this apparent to viewers. No one in their right mind should put the title of a Jane Austen book on a movie that does not closely follow the story for fear of raising the hackles of the many purists out there (myself among them).

Directed by Ron Howard, this out of this world movie was very successful on bringing the exciting and the entertainment value. One small step for a man, is indeed one giant leap for mankind. Adapted from the book, 'Lost Moon The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13', by astronaut Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger. The movie follows astronauts, Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) aboard Apollo 13 spacecraft, attempting for a Moon landing mission. En-route to the moon, they suffer from an on-board explosion that deprives their spacecraft of most of its oxygen supply and electric power. This force NASA's flight controllers to abort the Moon landing, and turn the mission into a rescue operation to get the three men home safely. Can they get the men back to Earth or will the astronauts, perish in space? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much; since the movie is based on true events, the movie does have a predictable outcome. Anybody, who readt the history books, or saw any NASA program, knows how the events ended. Still, there are some really dangerous moments that might surprise some viewers, and make you jump, out of their seat, wondering if the crew was going to live or die. Even if you were the biggest NASA fan; the movie showcase a lot of things that you might not, know about the mission. You don't know the gravity of the dangerous situation until you watch Apollo 13! Indeed, failure wasn't an option. This movie was intense! Honestly, in my opinion, the best way to watch this movie, is to go into it, having no clue, what's the story is about. It will leave you more of an impact. While, Apollo 13 shot for the moon and it kinda miss, at least, it's among the stars. Every actor in this movie shine. Tom Hanks was great as the leading man. The supporting cast was equality as good. My favorites had to be Ed Harris as Gene Kranz, Head of Mission Control and Gary Sinise as astronaut, Ken Mattingly. I even love the cameo from the real life, Jim Lovell as a captain of the recovery ship USS Iwo Jima. One thing, that I didn't like, about the film, is how negatively, the portrayal of Jack Swigert was. They portrayal him, as a weaker astronaut, compare to the others, because of his lack of training, and bachelor status. In real life, Swigert was a well-trained Command Module pilot and highly respected. He was no black sheep. No one was really too worried about whether he was up to the job, but the real-life, Lovell admitted, he were really worried about was the rendezvous with Swigert as they left the Moon, but that never got to happen. Another thing, when did being a bachelor; became a bad thing? Didn't every man in the life, start out, as a bachelor, at one time? I have to say, despite that. Kevin Bacon did surprising, pretty well. Bill Paxton as Fred Haise, was alright for the role, but he's by far, the weakest in the film. I love how accurate the film is. The dialogue between ground control and the astronauts was taken nearly verbatim from transcripts and recordings, with the exception of one of the taglines of the film, Houston, we have a problem. This quote alone, was voted one of the best movie lists in movie history. Ron Howard went to great lengths to create a technically accurate movie, employing NASA's technical assistance in astronaut and flight controller training for his cast, and even obtaining permission to film scenes aboard a reduced gravity aircraft, KC-135 for realistic depiction of the weightlessness experienced by the astronauts in space. The actors went aboard multiple KC-135 flights so much, that they outdone, even real astronauts in the amount of training, they got. I have to say, all the training, pull off in a realistic portrayal. Not only that, the movie went the extra mile in special effects. In an era where CGI was primitive, this movie was able to make it look like a rocket was blasting off into space, while, using little CGI. All the space shots were original made, and not taken from previous NASA space stock footage. There was no moment in the film that I didn't believe, they weren't in space. Even, real life astronauts like Buzz Aldrin got fooled, in believing they were in space. While, the movie is pretty accurate to historical events, Apollo 13 did take some artistic licenses for dramatic effects. In real life, the three astronauts remained surprisingly cool under pressure in real life, but the movie ramped up emotional tensions between them to make it, more thrilling. One thing that I didn't like, about the film is how much, foreshadowing, they used in the film. We get it! Did we really need, the scene where Jim's car was having problems or Jim's wife, Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) losing her wedding ring? Come on! Another problem is the abundance of technical babble and bureaucratic jargon. Some scenes were really hard to understand, what was going on. Still, the movie does a good job, trying to explain, all the science. One thing that I love about the film; is composter James Horner's score. It really captures the wonder of flight. Overall From lift-off to splashdown, Apollo 13 gives one hell of a ride. It was a very compelling, smart and suspenseful movie. A must-watch.

I feel like this aspect is a tad too underrated after reading other reviews. It's always fitting to the situation and creates an intense atmosphere.Another aspect to discuss is the acting. I was surprised. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the only person I can imagine to play the role of Terminator T-800. His style and pronunciation is simply hilarious. After being the villain in the first movie, one feels sympathy towards Arnie. On the other hand we see Linda Hamilton playing the role of Sarah Conner, a valiant woman switching from a mother yearning after her son and a psycho woman disobeying the rules and hurting people.

Edward Furlong plays the role of the child, and I have to be honest I thought that he was pretty annoying and frustrating to watch in the beginning. He's the typical kid from the block that breaks rules, does whatever he wants and acts like a provocative scumbag.

The character development and progression of relation between each character was great to follow.

Not just because of the IMDb-rating, also because the movie is arguably considered as one of the best action movies of all time and won four Academy Awards.Throughout the film I wasn't bored for a single moment. Exactly that is what makes an action movie great. I didn't expect thought- provocative topics to be discussed or heartbreaking dialogues. All a good movie from the action genre needs is followingTo begin with, the directing of this movie (by the amazing James Cameron) was incredibly well done. The camera has been stellar due to the sundry shots and different methods used to catch the action scenes. This made the movie more exciting to watch. Moreover, the music was perfect. I feel like this aspect is a tad too underrated after reading other reviews. It's always fitting to the situation and creates an intense atmosphere.Another aspect to discuss is the acting. I was surprised. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the only person I can imagine to play the role of Terminator T-800. His style and pronunciation is simply hilarious. After being the villain in the first movie, one feels sympathy towards Arnie. On the other hand we see Linda Hamilton playing the role of Sarah Conner, a valiant woman switching from a mother yearning after her son and a psycho woman disobeying the rules and hurting people. She seriously impressed me which was unexpected. Finally, we should talk about Edward Furlong. He plays John Conner, the soon to be hero who is key for humanity to survive in the future. Edward Furlong plays the role of the child, and I have to be honest I thought that he was pretty annoying and frustrating to watch in the beginning. He's the typical kid from the block that breaks rules, does whatever he wants and acts like a provocative scumbag. But from time to time you got to know him more and more and catch yourself liking him. Also the acting of Furlong improved during the movie, in my opinion.The visual and special effects are stupendous. Even in 2015 these effects would be considered as good. I liked it and imagine it to be even more amazing in the 90s.The writing and the dialogs weren't exceptional or mind-blowing, but it was surely good enough for an action-sci-fi-movie.Although the story was in general near to the first movie, it had more depth.

Valerie Jean Solanas (born 1936, died 1988), Wikipedia reads, was an American radical feminist writer best known for the SCUM Manifesto and as the would-be murderer of pop artist Andy Warhol. Solanas despised men, not as people but as society's weak links she figured that men, with their Y chromosomes, were genetic accidents, and that women were meant to rule the world. Not like Beyoncé currently preaches, though Solanas' goal was to completely exterminate the sex, thus ending the possibilities of future generations and setting the female example in stone.If her logic sounds crazy to you, then you, of course, are of sound mind. But don't let her fanatical blueprints undermine your interest in her. Anything written about Solanas, understandably, makes her sound like a lunatic on the move &#x97; that's why 1996's I Shot Andy Warhol is such an impactful film. Sure, she still seems like a lunatic on the move. But unexpected is how fascinating of a woman she is, a staggering example of a highly intelligent force of nature who was so struck down during their formative years that using a high IQ for something rational in adulthood seems too mad of a thought. I Shot Andy Warhol is so much more than a true crime story set to the screen; it's more comparable to a brilliant character study that just so happens to be based on true events. Harron is invested in Solanas but is also attentive toward the people that surround her. We are understanding of Solanas' view of herself and the view from the judgmental eyes of The Factory and beyond &#x97; Harron is so subtly thorough that there are times we forget we aren't actually watching a Candy Darling biopic or a Factory documentary.

Solanas' entrance only adds wood to the personal fires of the people she continually harasses; explosive results should have been expected originally.More remarkable is the acting. When it comes to biographical tales, often tiresome is the idea that more attention is given to the fact that hey, _______ _______ is playing ______ ______!, when, in actuality, real figures should have as much depth, if not more, than your average movie character. Astonishing is the way I Shot Andy Warhol makes the situation feel as though it is happening before our very eyes. Solanas is not glorified nor portrayed as a crazy person left to expire in the throes of infamy. Instead, she is a misunderstood genius so unrelentingly cast aside by society that Warhol's emotional standoffishness causes an already unstable person to completely snap. Taylor embodies Solanas so convincingly that the increasing madness of her character does instill fear in us.Supporting players Dorff and Harris also make a huge impression Dorff is terrific as Candy Darling. Never leaning toward caricature-ish body movements or stereotyped predictabilities, he touches deep as a transsexual who made it (kind of) in a time where most were stamped on by culture. Harris turns Warhol into the eccentric we never knew he was, as an artist so hypnotized by the looks, feelings, and auras of others that he never really knew how to be himself. He's polite to Solanas, never turning her down like he should, but is it because he's nice or because she acts as a distraction to his unhealthy habit of consuming himself with the other?I Shot Andy Warhol is gigantically effective; it tells a story coercive even to the most casual of a viewer while also authentically investing in the neuroses of the real figures it brings to the celluloid.

","genre":"Biography, Drama"},{"date":"29 June 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The number of people who misunderstand the goals of feminism is astonishing. To the kiddos who live by the word of conservatives and close-minded nefarios, the term is synonymous with man-hating, or, a case of female empowerment too supposedly vicious and oppressive for its own good. All feminists want is for the female race to have the same basic rights as men, which is fair, not terrifying. (Another case exemplifying why putting labels on issues can be a dangerous thing.) The meninists of our time, unfortunately, have feminists mixed up with combative revolutionaries akin to, I don't know, Valerie Solanas. Who is Valerie Solanas, you ask? Valerie Jean Solanas (born 1936, died 1988), Wikipedia reads, was an American radical feminist writer best known for the SCUM Manifesto and as the would-be murderer of pop artist Andy Warhol. Solanas despised men, not as people but as society's weak links she figured that men, with their Y chromosomes, were genetic accidents, and that women were meant to rule the world. Not like Beyoncé currently preaches, though Solanas' goal was to completely exterminate the sex, thus ending the possibilities of future generations and setting the female example in stone.If her logic sounds crazy to you, then you, of course, are of sound mind. But don't let her fanatical blueprints undermine your interest in her. Anything written about Solanas, understandably, makes her sound like a lunatic on the move &#x97; that's why 1996's I Shot Andy Warhol is such an impactful film. Sure, she still seems like a lunatic on the move. But unexpected is how fascinating of a woman she is, a staggering example of a highly intelligent force of nature who was so struck down during their formative years that using a high IQ for something rational in adulthood seems too mad of a thought. I Shot Andy Warhol is so much more than a true crime story set to the screen; it's more comparable to a brilliant character study that just so happens to be based on true events. Harron is invested in Solanas but is also attentive toward the people that surround her. We are understanding of Solanas' view of herself and the view from the judgmental eyes of The Factory and beyond &#x97; Harron is so subtly thorough that there are times we forget we aren't actually watching a Candy Darling biopic or a Factory documentary. Every character, compelling or not, is damaged in some way, making the film much more resonant. Solanas' entrance only adds wood to the personal fires of the people she continually harasses; explosive results should have been expected originally.More remarkable is the acting. When it comes to biographical tales, often tiresome is the idea that more attention is given to the fact that hey, _______ _______ is playing ______ ______!, when, in actuality, real figures should have as much depth, if not more, than your average movie character. Astonishing is the way I Shot Andy Warhol makes the situation feel as though it is happening before our very eyes. Solanas is not glorified nor portrayed as a crazy person left to expire in the throes of infamy. Instead, she is a misunderstood genius so unrelentingly cast aside by society that Warhol's emotional standoffishness causes an already unstable person to completely snap. Taylor embodies Solanas so convincingly that the increasing madness of her character does instill fear in us.Supporting players Dorff and Harris also make a huge impression Dorff is terrific as Candy Darling. Never leaning toward caricature-ish body movements or stereotyped predictabilities, he touches deep as a transsexual who made it (kind of) in a time where most were stamped on by culture. Harris turns Warhol into the eccentric we never knew he was, as an artist so hypnotized by the looks, feelings, and auras of others that he never really knew how to be himself.

And I still fail making sense about it or trying to under stand what Herzog wanted to tell us here. But maybe that's not even the point. Maybe there is no deeper message in here and it's really only a film to enjoy for its absurdity and uniqueness. I have to say I am a great fan of the filmmaker Herzog and I have seen most his works, including his very old short films. Then again, this one here is also a very early work, his second feature film and Herzog was still in his 20s when he wrote and directed it.This is a black-and-white film that runs for roughly 95 minutes and tells us about a group of dwarfs living together in their own community. No normal-sized people appear in this film. But some animals do, like in that absurd final scene with the laughing dwarf and the camel. Actually, these dwarfs are basically laughing for the entire film and it sounds like they were evil little gnomes, maybe because I (or people in general) have so little to do with disabled people like these in this movie. But there is no need for sympathy. The dwarfs are leading a good life and seem to be having fun for almost the entire screen time. Do not mistake this for a documentary though. All the people in here are actors, they are not really living in a community like this and there is also not a single word of narration by Herzog.I would not say this is among the director's best films, but there is something strangely captivating about it nonetheless. It's fascinating to watch these little men in their everyday life and how they deal with situations which we would not even consider a problem like when that one dwarf tries to climb the bed, bus is simply too small. I enjoyed watching this. It's a definite contender for Herzog's weirdest movie (and that is quite an honor given everything he has done) and I recommend giving it a look. Oh yeah and one of the absolute highlights is the music in here. Truly captivating tunes that exude a very special mentality and atmosphere.

I knew going in it would be nothing like the original and was completely fine with that, but this movie goes out of its way to be as ridiculous as possible. The genuine scares from the original have been replaced by awkward comedic bits, from the cannibal family's bickering to Leatherface making silly faces (yeah, they had the audacity to turn Leatherface into a punchline). It's just embarrassing, and this is largely due to an inconsistent script. The first act sets an ominous tone from its premise of hearing a murder live on the radio and the radio host being terrorized by the same murderers. Then the second act is silly, borderline cartoonish with Leatherface acting like a hormonal teenager; and the third act tries to pay homage to the original by recreating the dinner scene almost exactly as it was in the first (but not nearly as effective) combined with an admittedly cool chainsaw duel between Lefty (Dennis Hopper) and Leatherface, then closing with a somewhat thrilling final struggle for the heroine to make her escape. Then it closes with another homage to the original and then credits roll and a cheesy '80s pop song ensues. If not for the second act, it had potential to be an engrossing story and potentially disturbing (the gore is still top-notch) but the drastic shifts in tone make it virtually impossible to become immersed into this overtly fake, cartoonish world.Thankfully, Tobe Hooper's directing makes even the dullest moments of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 aesthetically pleasing. The location and set design is perfect - the underground lair with brightly colored lights juxtaposed with rotting corpses and leftover entrails is oddly unsettling, and the scenery during the final moments of the movie is hauntingly beautiful. Hooper knows how to make these scenes look as gritty and urgent as possible. Dennis Hopper's Texas ranger was also a welcome addition. He was related to Franklin of the first movie and is out for revenge on these hillbillies so he buys the biggest chainsaw he can, then storms their lair screaming his lungs out like a lunatic.What ultimately killed this movie for me (aside from the script) is the lead actress. She is just awful. You can't take anything she says seriously because of how poorly she delivers her lines, and her screams are so forced and annoying I was practically rooting for Leatherface to chop her head off. Her relationship with Leatherface is also forced and awkward, but maybe that was the screenwriters' attempt at comedy. There are a couple laughs in this movie, and by that I mean two; three max. Something about the bombastic chainsaw duel is undeniably exhilarating, despite it not being fleshed out to its full potential.There is some fun to be had in this movie, but you have to suffer through a lot of stupidity to get there. I have no idea how sequels continued coming out after this, and I can even empathize why they would want to make a sequel reboot with Texas Chainsaw 3D, but that was even more abominable than The Texas Chainsaw Massacre's true sequel - this - and this is pretty darn bad.

Well it was forgettable alright, but not what I would call entertaining...The big problem here is the story which is quite poorly conceived. Although the Liu Kang story arc is quite well established, the Sonia Blade storyline with Kano isn't very well developed meaning for me that this aspect of the film was quite uninteresting. The fight scene between Blade and Kano was also quite poor and really lacked any kind of intensity. Johnny Cage tags along as the requisite jock who was more of a smug irritant than anything else.This leads me on to another big issue with this film and that issue is character development; the writers here don't seem to bother fleshing any of the characters out meaning that many characters appear quickly and disappear just as quickly. Surely it would have been a stronger film if both the protagonists and the villains were fleshed out a little more. All of these problems do mean that it is a very hard film to care about while you're watching it.Another jarring thing about this film was the soundtrack which was pumping at 10,000 decibels during every single fight scene. Did the director go to the MTV school of directing? Not only was the soundtrack annoying and unnecessary, but it didn't help that the fight sequences were poorly choreographed and anti-climactic. The fights had no intensity about them and just generally lacked in excitement.The performances in this film were pitiful with the possible exception of Tagawa who was actually quite effective in his role as Shang Tsung.This could have been a film that you could say was so bad it's good, it has the silliness, but it isn't entertaining or exciting enough to work.

Back to the Film the direction is unforgettable and so pristine it reminded me of the old films of the 30s and 40s it really touched me the film has a strong directional style it effortlessly moves from one time period to the other with ease The film is presented over a 35 40 year period or time frame if you will and the first few scenes are so beautiful because they capture all emotions in a split second Happiness, Joy and wonder when Celie and Nettie are playing together and doing their signature hand clapping motion which is their way of connecting with each other they know they are together because they have connected with their hand clapping motion and song that they sing every time they are on screen together they love each other and are very close you can feel that! Celie at the tender age of 14 is pregnant 14 forced to have a baby by her own father yes her own father and one of the most brutal sequences of any motion picture is when her newborn is taken away from her by her own father I knew I was in for an unforgettable movie experience after those opening scenes because I cried my eyes out I lost all happiness and joy and cried and I cried all the way through in the right places of course and when the end comes you have earned it it just does not happen straight away this a long film but boy is it it worth your 2 hours and a half but you have to watch it alone no one else you need to gather yourself at the end of the film and sit through the credits just so you can process what you have just experienced and to think this landmark Masterpiece was nominated for 11 Oscars and won none is a travesty a real tragedy it is awful that this film was not Best Picture and was beaten by Out of Africa out of blooming Africa it is a real travesty the biggest mistake the Oscars ever made The Color Purple is the Best Picture of 1985 and here's why, the direction the performances the emotional connection you have to the characters and the uplifting ending! One Last note I want to thank Steven Spielberg for giving us this film so we all can share this film with the world and connect with it as much as I did and always will for all time! And no John Williams score can you all imagine what he would have composed for this masterpiece instead we get Quincy Jones why I have no flipping idea!

This film is so beautiful and heartfelt and just so wonderfully enriching and thoughtful it really is so enriching you really connect with the film I was really connected to the film I have a strong meaningful connection to the film and that is the strong emotional and heartbreaking story that Unfolds and it never lets you relax right until the end which I won't spoil here I want everyone to experience the film for themselves I just was lost for words and I am now writing this review because I want the film to connect with all who see it I really do feel a strong connection to Celie and Nettie the sisters at the heart of the story and all the other characters Shug Mister Harpo Squeak Old Mister Sophia everyone in this film has a story and a connection to the main story and I feel really strongly that this film is for all time and will live on for new generations to experience and connect with these extraordinary women of such courage and such strength and sheer determination to not tolerate the abuse and the suffering they are forced into it really touched me at the end when everything is resolved because they learn an vital lesson in life stand up for yourself and never tolerate suffering and abuse and the film is very timely for me because the news always reports on sexual violence by dominant men and women which should not be tolerated and it really should not be happening and sadly people still feel the need to treat people with no compassion or dignity or kindness and that is what I took away from this unforgettable film never force yourself to dominant forces of malevolent evil I really feel strongly towards this film that it teaches the world that sexual violence or discrimination towards any race of gender inequality is an act of pure evil and an injustice to all man kind and all race religion and all people! Back to the Film the direction is unforgettable and so pristine it reminded me of the old films of the 30s and 40s it really touched me the film has a strong directional style it effortlessly moves from one time period to the other with ease The film is presented over a 35 40 year period or time frame if you will and the first few scenes are so beautiful because they capture all emotions in a split second Happiness, Joy and wonder when Celie and Nettie are playing together and doing their signature hand clapping motion which is their way of connecting with each other they know they are together because they have connected with their hand clapping motion and song that they sing every time they are on screen together they love each other and are very close you can feel that! Celie at the tender age of 14 is pregnant 14 forced to have a baby by her own father yes her own father and one of the most brutal sequences of any motion picture is when her newborn is taken away from her by her own father I knew I was in for an unforgettable movie experience after those opening scenes because I cried my eyes out I lost all happiness and joy and cried and I cried all the way through in the right places of course and when the end comes you have earned it it just does not happen straight away this a long film but boy is it it worth your 2 hours and a half but you have to watch it alone no one else you need to gather yourself at the end of the film and sit through the credits just so you can process what you have just experienced and to think this landmark Masterpiece was nominated for 11 Oscars and won none is a travesty a real tragedy it is awful that this film was not Best Picture and was beaten by Out of Africa out of blooming Africa it is a real travesty the biggest mistake the Oscars ever made The Color Purple is the Best Picture of 1985 and here's why, the direction the performances the emotional connection you have to the characters and the uplifting ending! One Last note I want to thank Steven Spielberg for giving us this film so we all can share this film with the world and connect with it as much as I did and always will for all time! And no John Williams score can you all imagine what he would have composed for this masterpiece instead we get Quincy Jones why I have no flipping idea! I will always love this film and after the credits finished I cried for hours so I urge all people to see this heartbreaking and thoughtful film as it should be loved and it will always be loved for all coming time!

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"29 June 2015","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Basic Instinct is possibly the best erotic thriller to come out in the past three decades. It's up there along with another 80's classic, Fatal Attraction. If you strip away the outer levels, this film has the makings of a classic noir film, easily comparable to 50's noir films. Although it does feature graphic nudity, blood, and several plot twists more commonly seen in recent films. This is a very engaging movie with memorable performances and a fantastic ending. Paul Verhoeven's film is about a detective named Nick Curran who is assigned to a murder case of a former rock star. While investigating the case, he meets this author named Catherine Trammell, who was the girlfriend of the rock star and comes across as very manipulative. Nick is convinced that she is the culprit. But as the investigation moves deeper, he begins to second guess himself on whether or not she did the murder. The film is full of fantastic performances. Michael Douglas must have a thing for erotic thrillers as he starred in both this film and the fore-mentioned Fatal Attraction. He was outstanding in this role, which was a challenging one. The real standout here is Sharon Stone as Catherine Trammell. A very seductive, manipulative woman with some secrets. I also liked Jeanne Tripplehorn's performance as the police station's psychologist. Overall, Basic Instinct is a very seductive erotic thriller that is entertaining and shocking. This is how you make a very good movie dealing with seduction. The movie is not perfect, as I felt this film is a borderline porno with the graphic nudity and it distracted me from the story a little bit. That being said, I loved the story and I loved this film which reminds me of noir films from back in the day.

I decided to download it on my iPad and watched the 2010 restoration. I was expecting a good little sci-fi silent with anti cruel government messages. I did get that, yes, but I got much more. The story follows Freder Frederson (Nice name) who is the son of the mayor of a grand city called Metropolis. Freder encounters a woman named Maria who is the caretaker of the worker's children. Freder learns that all the workers live in their own little underground city and are not allowed into Metropolis. Freder confronts his father about this and gets a negative response. His father then fires his assistant Josaphat. Freder then let's Josaphat live at his house, while he goes off to take the places of workers. Freder learns that Maria also runs an underground church for the workers. She is trying to give them faith that a mediator between brain and hands will come and help them. Freder's father learns of this and has an inventor named Rotwang have his Machine-Man take Maria's form and pose as her to crush their faith in a mediator. For 1927 that is a great plot, even today it works. Fritz Lang really takes advantage of this and gives us some of the best direction I've ever seen. The effects are beautiful and innovative. The use of mirrors and double exposure is just wonderful. The performance are good. Some of the actors over act (The men in the yoshiwara during Maria's dance are just the worst), but some of them give good, non goofy performances. The best performance comes from Brigitte Helm. The way she plays Robot Maria is over the top, but because of that, you have to love it. The ways she moves quickly and talks is just so fun and entertaining. The screenplay is well written, even though the dialogue can be pathetic sometimes. The production design is the most iconic thing about the movie. The way the city of Metropolis looks has influenced a great number of films. It was a vision of the future that does exist today. Look at modern New York City and Metropolis. The resemblance is certainly there. Overall, Metropolis is well directed, interesting, vision of the future with important social commentary.
