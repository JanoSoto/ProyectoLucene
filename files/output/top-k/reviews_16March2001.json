Hitch consistently made films that were not only as entertaining as a film can possibly get, but also films that were extraordinarily intellectual and human. Films such as Lifeboat, Rear Window, and Vertigo work as art as much as any other films ever made, studying the human condition and utilizing the tools of cinema to the utmost.Hitch was also the most prolific film artist of all time. He made over 50 films. He made more masterpieces than any other filmmaker, too. Several, such as Vertigo, Psycho, and Rear Window, are bona fide masterpieces. No one in their right mind would disagree with their status as some of the best films ever made. But everyone has that one Hitchcock film that they feel that they understand better than anyone else, and always claim that it deserves to belong in the same status as the more accepted masterpieces. I seem to have discovered several. In fact, every time I see one of his less popular films, I think that it has gotten a bum rap. Rope is my favorite underrated Hitchcock film, but I think that it is starting to be accepted by the masses more. Two other great ones that are less popular are Lifeboat and I Confess; Lifeboat is well respected by Hitchcock fanatics, but I Confess is usually dismissed. This sort of dismissal happens because of financial failure upon first release. Hitch certainly was an artist, but, if you've read the Truffaut interview book, you realize that he took a film's financial success or failure very personally.Now we come to Stage Fright. I don't think that it was an enormous failure, but it was also not an enormous success. Truffaut says something like this film neither added to nor took away from your reputation. The main complaint is that the opening flashback is a lie, and that audiences could never accept that. I think that that technique works better now than it may have in 1950. It was sort of daring, but it failed at the time. Although most people still don't want to ever think that the characters in a film are lying, you still see it, especially in neo-noir (think Chinatown, Body Heat, etc, although those aren't flashbacks, per se). Truffaut also derides it for being a whodunit, which Hitch did not like. I don't think that Stage Fright is at all a whodunit. We assume through the entire film that Marlene Dietrich is unquestionably guilty in the crime.There are just a few very minor problems in the film, most of them stemming from the trick ending trick endings are in style right now, but they hardly ever work. This one does, mostly, but as soon as we realize we've been tricked, just as happens at the end of The Sixth Sense, a very good film otherwise, we begin to go over the earlier events to see if there was any cheating. There is in Stage Fright, and it loses a tiny bit of credibility from this. The other main problem is just how the police deal with the criminals at the end. It's hardly believable, and they kill the main criminal in a very gruesome way that I would think would get them reprimanded by their superiors (although it was cool). Anyway, it's nowhere near as bad as the way the police act at the end of Hitch's next film, Strangers on a Train, where a cop shoots randomly at a crowd (with the criminal in it) and accidentally kills an innocent man!The gold of this film comes in the complex situations and characters. One reason why Hitch's films stand so far beyond the run-of-the-mill thriller is that his characters are so well developed. The actors in Stage Fright are also superb. Jane Wyman, the main character, has an extraordinarily complicated role, where she has to act at several different levels (she plays an actress who believes that her skills can help her learn more about a murder); she pretends that she's someone else, and as she meets more people, the more difficult it becomes to handle the situation. She also switches horses in midstream, where she begins to doubt her relationship with the man whom she is helping and to fall for a detective on the murder case simultaneously. Richard Todd plays a man framed for murder. One excellent twist in the script is that his character is not intelligent. We're so used to characters being as astute as Sherlock Holmes in mystery films, but he's an illogical hothead who takes very stupid risks. Marlene Dietrich has a lot of fun here playing a demon-goddess. She's just hilarious, trying really hard to act depressed over her husband's death (and she's one of the most terrible singers you'll ever hear!). I love how she controls everyone in the film, even those who are trying to be her enemies. You just can't refuse Marlene! Possibly the most memorable and amusing performance in the film is that of Alastair Sim, most famous for playing Ebenezer Scrooge a year later. He's hilarious as Wyman's father. Micheal Wilding, playing the detective who is falling for Wyman, is also great, especially when he finds that she is betraying him and may have only been using him. There are a few very memorable cameos, too, including the bibulous gent, a turtle-like man who offers Wyman comfort, and the shooting gallery matron (the whole shooting gallery scene is great).Stage Fright has been trampled by the more outstanding Hitchcock pictures. It is a small gem, not boring in any way. It deserves to be rediscovered by more people.

With Titus Andronicus, one of his earliest, least-known, and least-liked plays, he conceived a production that had every atrocity one can think of. Rape, murder, incest, cannibalism, it's all there. For centuries, the play was criticized, became the centre of controversy, and was often banned from being performed at all. Over 500 years later, British director Julie Taymor produced one of the greatest Shakespeare film adaptations of all time, Titus. Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange star.The film's introduction involves a young boy, seemingly about 10-12 years old, sitting at his kitchen table with food and several war toys from the Roman Empire and more recent wars. On his kitchen table, he creates his own vision of carnage, pulling apart his toys, dropping them in a glass of milk, and then covering them with ketchup to simulate blood. All of a sudden, a giant blast comes through a window towards him and he runs for shelter under the table. Suddenly, a dirty-looking man appears under the table, hoists him up on his shoulders, takes him to his cellar, and behind the cellar door he walks into a Roman arena. There, the young boy is confronted by an entire Roman army returning from battle, led by the valiant general, Titus Andronicus (Hopkins). He is only returning from battle with the sadistic Goths, led by their Queen Tamora (Lange). After losing 18 of his 20 sons to the Goth armies, Titus takes Tamora and her two sons, Chiron (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and Demetrius (Matthew Rhys) prisoner. Titus has returned to Rome a hero, and in turn has won the respect of all within the kingdom.Titus' popularity is the object of jealousy for Saturninus (Alan Cumming), the newly crowned Caesar. Saturninus is engaged to Titus' beautiful daughter, Lavinia (Laura Fraser), who is in love with Bassianus (James Frain). This, of course, is not approved by Lavinia or Bassianus. When Saturninus receives the word that the Goths have been captured, just to make Titus mad, Saturninus orders Tamora, Chiron, and Demetrius set free, and takes Tamora as his Queen over Lavinia. Now Queen, Tamora is free to do as she deems fit, and continues an affair with her lover, Aaron the Moor (Harry Lennix, pulling off the best performance in the film). Aaron, the object of lust for Tamora, persuades her into seeking revenge on Titus for his injustice against her. So, in response to Aaron's suggestion, Tamora offers Chiron and Demetrius the chance to do as they wish with Lavinia, simply to avenge their imprisonment after the war. Chiron and Demetrius do as she asks, kidnap Lavinia, rape her, cut off her hands and tongue, and leave her standing on a tree trunk in a forest. She is discovered by Marcus Andronicus (Colm Feore), brother and voice of reason to Titus. Titus finds her disfigured when Marcus brings her to him, and will not stand to see his daughter feel outcast for her disfigurement. In response, he cuts off his own hand, seemingly to avenge his daughter... unforunately, all is not yet avenged in Rome. Titus Andronicus will not stand to see his daughter disfigured without getting even with Tamora. Thus sets off a turbulent chain of events that will ultimately lead to the end of a rivalry, the fall of an empire, and the descent of a man. Indeed, as the billing suggests, If you think revenge is sweet, taste this.A well-made, time-bending, stomach-turning, eye-popping, gut-busting film left unknown by the general public, Titus is one of the greatest films I have ever had the privilege of viewing. Julie Taymor created a Roman Empire that makes Gladiator seem, how do you say, as exciting as a state of the union address. Ms. Taymor presented to us a new world, and timeless void with gladiator arenas, marble palaces, pool tables, video games, discmans, and violence all the same. Never before have I had an experience that commented on violence the way that Titus has shown here. The ultimate message of the film suggests that no matter what the day, what the time, what the era, violence, revenge, murder, and atrocity will always exist and remain relatively the same. Despite the underlying message of the film, there is far more to be adored here, if you can look past the disturbing content. Brilliant production design, cinematography, editing, special effects, and costumes, ahhh the costumes. This is all besides the excellent cast, actors who, Harry Lennix in particular, actually know how to speak their Shakespearean lines! They are not shouted, screamed, or simply said in an incomprehensible manner. We know exactly what the actors are talking about, all mentioned in the correct context. Being a Shakespearean actor myself, I can just imagine the kind of Hell the director put the actors through to learn their lines... not just memorize them, LEARN them. This is a virtue missing from other Shakespearean adaptations, most notably the youthful William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. All in all... haven't I said enough already? 5 stars to Titus.

At which point there is a striking, really unforgettable pivotal scene and a decision is made.  Unfortunately it's the wrong decision  the narrative very quickly unravels, and the story is thenceforth ridiculous.  Despite that, there's much to admire.  The acting is excellent  Harvey Keitel brings just the right degree of ambiguity and obnoxiousness to his role.  Kate Winslet has never turned in a lame performance and here she is simply radiant.  Both of them inhabit their characters fully -- you truly believe that they truly believe the crap they are spouting, and it makes their psychological battle so much more compelling.  The supporting cast also deserves a mention for being quirky and interesting.  They add a great deal of genuinely warm, yet hokey humor which offsets the seriousness of the roles played by Winslet and Keitel.  Further, the cinematography is beautiful and occasionally breathtaking, and Jane Campion's direction is wonderful.  But (very mild spoiler) she could've spared the world another look at Keitel's naked body.

I've seen it a dozen times. As a child I found it horrifying and compelling. I still find it difficult to switch off, or to watch. But repeated viewings have pointed up glaring weaknesses in the production and screenplay.Begin with cast and characters. Jack Lemmon plays, basically, Jack Lemmon--the same likeable frenetic guy he was in It Should Happen to You and most of his other early films. Somehow or other Joe Clay, this son of a vaudevillian couple, has become a high-flying PR account rep. The job is believable for Lemmon but how he got there is left to the imagination; and my imagination totally fails me. The Joe Clay character needs more backstory. As for Lee Remick, she is a complete cipher. Kirsten Arnesen Clay wanted to be an actress--so what happened to her career? What is she doing in San Francisco? What are they both doing in San Francisco, come to think of it? Shouldn't they _really_ be in New York? Doesn't the 'cockroach' scene really seem to be taking place in a New York building, not a San Fran one?More annoying is the sudden narrative gap that appears a third of the way into the story. We jump ahead five years and fine Joe and Kirsten and their little daughter living in a squalid flat near Union Square. We learn Joe's been fired from five more jobs. It seems to me that whatever happened in those five years, it's a lot more interesting than anything that happened before or after. Did they first go to another high-rise while Joe found himself another PR job, which he then lost for being too convivial? Did he work steadily for long periods, then go on sudden benders? Did they slowly descend down the social scale, or was there a sudden rupture from which Joe and Kirsten have never recovered? Has he been effectively unemployable?Surely there must be a history of various small loans made to them over the years by Mr. Arnesen, made with the understanding that Joe and Kirstie would cut back on their drinking. Wasn't gramps around to give Christmas presents to his only grandchild? We have to believe he was.So when Joe tells Kirstie it's time for them to turn over a new leaf, and go ask Arnesen for a grubstake, he's really interested more in survival and getting another handout than he is in giving up the bottle. Sure they'll quit drinking; Arnesen had let them know time and again that would be part of the deal. But it's a deal made dishonestly, so that after a month of rehabilitation they're ready to fall right off the wagon again.This binge at Arnesen's Nursery may be their worst drunk ever--how often does anyone get a chance to smash up the greenhouse?--but we know it has to be the culmination of five years of similar rampages.

But one angel decides he wants to become human, in this version it's simply because he falls in love with a woman, and falls to earth. It goes on from there...The ironic thing is that American remakes usually redo rather dark European films as big dumb action flicks and\/or lighthearted romances. But City of Angels redoes a joyous, sweet film as the penultimate cheesy melodrama. Here the classic American overkill is not with more explosions and sex, but with more desperate, gaudy, manipulative solemnity and pretension.In the original, Bruno Ganz plays Damiel, the angel, with a kind of casual elation. He falls to earth not simply because he falls in love, but because he wants to enjoy human life, the simple pleasures - coffee, cigarettes, the circus, children, color, smell, singing, sex, etc... And he doesn't have to have a freakin' epiphany with each discovery of a small part of human existence, part of the point is that he becomes acclamated because he is already more human than angel to begin with. Nicholas Cage plays Damiel like a terrified alien, most of the time feeling very very sorry for us sad humans, and occasionally shedding profound tears of wonder at our potential for good. Honestly I felt like punching Nicholas Cage in his poignantly wistful face every five minutes.An even more blatent example of the needless overdramatizing comes in the form of the leading lady's role. In the original, the object of Damiel's affection is Marion, played by lovely and talented Solveig Donmartin. Marion is a trapeze artist who lives life to the fullest, but is dreamy and aimless, searching to find a true connection. In the remake, Meg Ryan is a *heart surgeon* trapped in the depths of a horrific depression over the meaninglessness of life and the pain of death. Can I get an oy veh? The love story in the original is quirky and fresh, the lovers spent the majority of time searching for each other, and when they do get together, it is one of the most beautiful and satisfying moments ever caught on film, totally totally devoid of shmaltz. The love story in the remake is ALL SCHMALTZ. Every moment they spend together is meant to be utterly profound, the height of joy and the height of despair - totally maudlin and manipulative. ICKY.All the problems with the remake stem from these misguided attempts to make the film serious and meaningful. It's bad high-school poetry.The real tragedy is that because Wings of Desire is a German movie, because it has a reputation for dealing with a lot of very profound and intellectual ideas, because it is very *complex*, people are turned off. I am here to tell you that, yes, Wings is more profound, more intellectual, more complex than City of Angels, but if you give it a chance, it is also lighter, funnier, more joyous, more entertaining, more beautiful, and more magical than City of Angels.

Marion is a trapeze artist who lives life to the fullest, but is dreamy and aimless, searching to find a true connection.

The love story in the original is quirky and fresh, the lovers spent the majority of time searching for each other, and when they do get together, it is one of the most beautiful and satisfying moments ever caught on film, totally totally devoid of shmaltz.

It's bad high-school poetry.The real tragedy is that because Wings of Desire is a German movie, because it has a reputation for dealing with a lot of very profound and intellectual ideas, because it is very *complex*, people are turned off. I am here to tell you that, yes, Wings is more profound, more intellectual, more complex than City of Angels, but if you give it a chance, it is also lighter, funnier, more joyous, more entertaining, more beautiful, and more magical than City of Angels.

But one angel decides he wants to become human, in this version it's simply because he falls in love with a woman, and falls to earth. It goes on from there...The ironic thing is that American remakes usually redo rather dark European films as big dumb action flicks and\/or lighthearted romances. But City of Angels redoes a joyous, sweet film as the penultimate cheesy melodrama. Here the classic American overkill is not with more explosions and sex, but with more desperate, gaudy, manipulative solemnity and pretension.In the original, Bruno Ganz plays Damiel, the angel, with a kind of casual elation. He falls to earth not simply because he falls in love, but because he wants to enjoy human life, the simple pleasures - coffee, cigarettes, the circus, children, color, smell, singing, sex, etc... And he doesn't have to have a freakin' epiphany with each discovery of a small part of human existence, part of the point is that he becomes acclamated because he is already more human than angel to begin with.

It really couldn't be portrayed in any other way than animation, and thanks to Martin Rosen, it has become the greatest animated film of all time, yet it is so often under-rated.  If you have seen it, then you won't need any introduction, as even just watching this film once, you will never forget it. This is also one of the few films that has been faithful to the original text, and has lost little from the novel by Richard Adams. Some of England's finest actors provide the voices for the rabbits (John Hurt, Denholm Elliot, Richard Briers and the late Sir Ralph Richardson).The film is also backed up by an utterly superlative soundtrack featuring a haunting instrumental score by Angela Morley, and of course the unforgettable soul-wrenching theme Bright Eyes written by Mike Batt and sung by Art Garfunkel.

MIT had the decade before gone through a soul-searching re-evaluation of the type of scientist it was producing, and concluded that they could do much better in working toward well-rounded citizens. So by the end of the 60's they had collected - for a few years only - perhaps the strongest collection of newly emergent thinkers in the humanities. And it was quite a rich stew of ideas for a young person, the most exciting place in the world for the humanities for perhaps five years.Malick came in with this pack, concerned with newly emerging ideas about meaning and language. The philosophy establishment was forming a new split (US and Continentals) largely characterized by how to reinvent Wittgenstein's insights but with a more friendly rationale. Chomsky was shaking one world, formal abstraction for computers another. Exciting --- moreso than today. But Malick was not a verbal communicator, nor a logician, nor an academic (all sides of the same thing). So he dove into practical visual semiotics.He is not a brilliant man, merely a journalist. But he does seem to be particularly honest and understands some damned good, solid, human ideas compared to other filmmakers. One can really see this early MIT exposure in 'Red Line.'We can thankfully forget plot -- there is not meant to be any story. In fact, the war is only used here as a canvas of motion, abstractions of 'regular' life, colliding and sometimes adhering to souls, sometimes destroying them. The device is to build the film around the sounds narrative voiceovers (current and remembered), natural sounds, haunting music. The images are attached to the sounds, which are derived from abstractions. This is exactly the reverse of Spielberg, which is why there cannot be any comparison to 'Private Ryan,' or any other film that is 'about' something. It is why Malick can never 'explain' his films.The execution is hypnotic. I wonder what the six-hour version is like. The editing (and particularly of the sound) is unusual, so transports us beyond the strangeness of tropics, war, history. That editing is much like Van Morrison's music it establishes the rhythm only as a reference to dance around, peeking in and out. The relationship of the rhythm within the shots to the rhythm of the shots is very bluesy.Having no story opens new possibilities and creates unfamiliar problems. An opportunity is that the film can have many centers the meditator in the midst of the attack on the camp; the squabble of the villagers; the transport of the ship; the need to look at our own dogtags. The challenge is how to end. When you stick to a formula like Spielberg, you just turn the crank and the climax lifts and comes down, and the story finishes. No story, no formula, so Malick brackets with the transport to and from the island, by the aging of the southern rookie, and by the exit from and re-entry to a world of unfamiliar characters. That they are played by familiar actors (Travolta, Clooney) oddly emphasizes the point.It must have been educational to work on this film, which is why every intelligent actor (or an actor with an intelligent agent) wanted to participate one can see direct influence in Penn's 'The Pledge' and Cusack's 'High Fidelity,' both highly abstract.Penn knew exactly what he was doing here. He moves in the action, as an actor must. But he places his character offscreen in the abstract voiceovers. That's the 'real' Welsh, and the film's image only an abstraction. He truly understands presenting many dimensions simultaneously. Harrelson doesn't, but that's the point with Keck. I wonder why Depp didn't make the cut?

And no, audience review has absolutely no influence on me.  I did not make the movie for you, I made it for myself.In my opinion, There are four types of movie\/movie makers, and ranked from high to low they are1 Those who wish to express and ends up impressing the viewers. 2 Those who wish to express but did not impress much. 3 Those who wish to impress and indeed did it. 4 and finally those who wish to impress but failed it.The greatest movies I have every seen falls in the first category.  The second category usually would not appear in the market.  Hollywood big budget flicks are good example of category 3 and 4, and usually it is easier to generate money from cat 3 movie rather than cat 1 movie.I have to compromise... You know, I've got family to feed too.  But the dream never dies.  All the way I am struggling between cat 1 and cat 3, and there is a lot of risk, for it will easily fall into cat 2.Now, for those who complains about the plot and character.  I could tell you I did that deliberately, and if you let me do it again I will still do it the same way.  Literature does not come in the only form of full blown novels, and so is the versatility of movies.  I express, to the extent that I think is suitable, and I bear no responsibility to give you a full story.Indeed, that is what I want to achieve, since you mentioned it.

And in the beginning it appeared as if it would deliver... but then that pesky thing called plot and characters caught up with it.My problems with the movie set in a nice labeled manner.1) Everyone is Russian and German, yet they sound either very English or very American, at least TRY to sound like your character.2) The movie degenerates into basically this for a plot 1) Ed Harris talks to kid who tells him stuff 2) Harris and Jude Law have a sniper standoff 3) Repeat steps 1 and 2, 4) Ed Harris is killed, 5) throw in a horribly forced love story (See Point #3 coming up)3) Ahhh, the most annoying point, the tacked on, and totally extraneous love story.  This is a WAR movie, if you want a love story see a romance.  I could have cared less about whether or not she was alive. (that sounds horrible but meh)4) Entirely too much bad dialogue, enough already, shoot each other! Onward to point 5.5) Ed Harris... he is supposed to be super evil nazi sniper, we want Jude Law to get him! But, we don't, or at least I didn't, he seemed like a rather nice fellow until he hanged Sasha.  Ed Harris needed to be thoroughly evil because he is the entire point of the movie.6) Anti-Climactic Climax. Fiennes sticking his head out was so melodromatic, and when Jude Law finally kills Ed Harris I thought well, he got him, time for creditsSo thats my gripe about this movie, I do not recommend it, (unless you like war movies with tacked on love interest, and lots of talking) in which case, run to your movie theater right now! Stop reading this and go!

The moral basis of this movie is so unbelievably stomach churning and inhumane that it beggars belief. In my innocence I never believed such views and perspectives could actually make it onto the big screen where they could poison the minds of the impressionable. The whole movie amounted to a demonization of the evil nasty Yemenese people who seem to be quite a mindless bunch of rock-throwing gun-toting terrorists if you believe the spin this movie throws at you, and at the same time a rationalisation of a mindless bloody massacre by the U.S. marines. Surely any U.S. marines out there who have seen this movie must have been deeply offended at how they were portrayed. I reckon Dr Joseph Goebbels and his ministry of propaganda could have learned a lesson or two from this movie(propaganda flick). It defies belief that two fine actors such as Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones would consent to appear in rubbish like this, even though they gave quite good performances, despite the hole-ridden plot. Have they fallen on hard times or what is their excuse? The only reason I could possibly recommend this movie would be to illustrate how one goes about producing propaganda. There are so many flaws with this movie that I won't even begin to list them. One can't really appreciate how bad and vile it is until it is actually viewed, but do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague. Terrible - morally reprehensible - vile!
