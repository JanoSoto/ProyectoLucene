You will enjoy seeing the womanizing low life Racine try to manipulate and control the wrong woman who thinks rings around him. The music with the dark settings, only a few daytime shots in the whole movie, is why this has endured over time while most of Kasdan's other efforts have faded. Noir is such a beloved genre, to any of you younger people, who have never watched Film Noir or Black Film, this is a great introduction for you. It is called black film because the shadows and darkness are existential metaphors for the moral darkness of the characters. Yes, Oscar is a good moral figure here trying to save poor Ned but, on the whole, the movie is filled with Noir nasty, evil, corrupt characters. When you read how copied it is, please, the boathouse? The phony name the whole movie? How about how she knew the case he pleaded years before and was stalking him all that time?Crenna's murder is surprisingly well done; it is awkward and Racine almost bites it trying to kill him. I love Indemnity but this murder is full of close calls and mistakes just like real life. You will cringe with Ned as he almost bungles it several times trying to follow that well laid plan that as Lauren, in Blood Simple, warns you never quite works out the way you thought it would. Even if we grant the above critics that the acting is bad, which it isn't outside of Hurt, the writing, music, photography and pacing are worth owning this for. SPOILER AHEAD It is rare for a Noir to be brave enough to have the protagonist lose and the villain win. This was the point of attack when it was released as being a big no no for Noir purists. Look, Racine was a corrupt, womanizing loser, frankly, plenty of people were not sorry to see him get treated like he used women. This is the movie that made Kathleen Turner a star. You will never see her more sultry and hot. The maligned nudity is a requisite for audiences with much shorter attention spans than classic Noir. Imagine Laura released today? Who would go see it? Kasdan does pour on the nudity and sex but it loses none of the intensity of Noir. A Classic Noir.

I just wish they wouldn't made sequel because it doesn't even compare to the first one. Speed 2 Cruise Control can't hold a candle to this movie. For me the sequel never happened. I only own this movie in Blu-ray collection and that is all. I love the theme score in the beginning of the movie and I love music at end of credits. I just love this movie, alongside with The Matrix, Johnny Mnemonic and Point Break is one of my favorite action film of Keanu Reeves. This movie is one of those films that is worth of watch and money. It seems like now this days, action films force themselves into a wickedly strange plot to try to be the next sixth sense and put more money into each explosion than into any actors. This is a film that you just love everybody in the movie because the acting is great as well as the original story line. Sure, its no Oscar winning type of film, but if your at home looking for a fun film to watch, SPEED is the right movie for you. Keanu Reeves & Sandra Bullock's chemistry really made this movie work. This movies Is a badass! It is directed by Jan de Bont the same director who directed the god awful sequel. This movie is just great, it is Die Hard on a bus. Speed is simply similar to other sequel movie like are Die Hard With A Vengeance (1995) that come out one year later, when Sandra was handcuffed on the train and Keanu was saving her, the same cuffing scene was later used in Die Hard With A Vengeance. McClane been on a train that explodes and goes off the barrels out of an incomplete stretch of track and crashes, the same scene was used from this movie. Die Hard With A vengeance borrowed out some scenes from this movie including China Town line. I still love both of these movies, they are both great action films of the 90's and one of my all time favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Speed is a classic in modern terms and one of Keanu Reeves best performances. This movie had me on the edge of my seat from the opening scene. One of the iconic movies of the 1990's, Speed is a highly entertaining, slick and polished action movie. It's a benchmark movie of its genre that was high in tension and excitement without the unruly gore of a 1980's action flick. The story itself is very good; it has some important depth to it that missing from most action movies. The cast is rock solid; Keanu Reeves was perfectly cast as Jack Traven, a smart, agile but reckless police officer with a tendency to disobey orders and creates inventive solutions to get the job done. Jeff Daniels plays the sympathetic, wise polar opposite partner, Harry Temple, well. Dennis Hopper chews the scenes excellently as the charismatic and twisted maniac of villain. Sandra Bullock Annie couldn't be more likable and innocent. Joe Morton's character as the Chief is lively enough to support the lead and the rest of the cast is definitely solid.The movie is a near perfect one for me. It's like a minor terrorist who knows the police force and knows how to work w\/ bombs which is really cool. Not only that Keanu Reeves makes an awesome cop and they have a great cast and supporting cast. Dennis Hopper makes a great villain, Sandra makes a great tough girl, and Jeff makes a great partner. I love the plot and the length of the movie. First starting off with a bomb on an elevator and then on a bus. And since it revolves around the bus ride the entire time they do a good job with adding little problems they must overcome to ensure the bus does not explode, such as sharp turns and getting on an unfinished bridge so they can stay over 50 mph.Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves), an LAPD cop on SWAT detail, has a fearless nature and a keen understanding of the criminal mind. That, and some luck have kept him alive. But Jack's luck is being put to the ultimate test. An elusive bomber-extortionist Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) is seeking vengeance after his latest ransom scheme is thwarted. Payne gives a personal challenge to Jack A bomb is rigged on a city bus, which will detonate if the speedometer drops below 50 MPH. Poor Annie (Sandra Bullock) gets shoved into the driver's seat, while Jack does his best to save the day.That is the basic plot, it is a slick film about a young cop who must prevent a bomb exploding aboard on a city bus by keeping its speed above 50 mph. and stop a terrorist by executing his plan.

It takes Ancient Greek mythology, completely twists it around while still retaining enough to keep it recognizable, adds painfully bright pastel colour palette, throws in some CGI and simpering sidekicks, and crowns it all off with a soundtrack that takes all of its inspiration from American gospel music. Interesting choices, if nothing else.Now, some of that I'm completely okay with. I don't really care that there are only five muses, instead of nine like there are in the original mythology. I don't think nine would have been too much, seeing that they're usually the ones singing and gospel music is well-equipped to large crowds singing it, but it's okay. Though it is a bit strange that they dropped Euterpe, the muse of song and music (and elegiac poetry), from the lineup. The use of CGI is also a bit jarring nowadays, because it hasn't aged that well, but I can see that they wanted to experiment with a new technology. Disney has always done that, though usually with better results. What is a bit harder for me to understand is the fact that they made Hades the villain instead of Hera, who was Hercules's main nemesis in the original myths, seeing as she was jealous that her husband Zeus had slept with a mortal woman, siring Hercules in the process. Or Heracles, as he should be called, because this is the Greek version of the myth. Then again, Disney is all about family values, so it's not that surprising. And James Woods does brilliant as the voice actor of Hades.What really keeps me from liking this film more is the main hero, unfortunately. Hercules just isn't all that interesting of a guy, especially when compared to the ones that came just before him. Simba, Belle, Aladdin, Quasimodo, all of these deep, tragic main characters. And yeah, Hercules has his problems, but he still comes across as that perfect high school jock. You know, the nice one, who could have starred in any breakfast cereal commercial he wanted, was the homecoming king, went on to have a successful career in sports, founded a perfect family and died at the age of one hundred, surrounded by grandkids. You have nothing against the guy, but you're also not really all that interested in the details of his life.Then again, Megara is great, Hades is excellent, Zeus is enjoyably over the top and boisterous, Phil and Pegasus are alright and the rest of the cast do their jobs. The animation is also very nice, though personally I'm not a fan of the colour palette, but that's a pet peeve of mine and not a fault of the film in any way. And while the songs and the music style are not outright classics like so many other Disney soundtracks of the 90s, there are some decent songs in the mix. Though couldn't you have given Hades a villain song? It would have been glorious.Ultimately Hercules is one of the weaker Renaissance films, but still lands somewhere in the middle as far as the overall quality of Disney films is to be considered.

Interesting choices, if nothing else.Now, some of that I'm completely okay with. I don't really care that there are only five muses, instead of nine like there are in the original mythology.

","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"15 November 2015","score":"","review":" The quintessential one man army flick, a classic action extravaganza, and a powerhouse of first-rate direction, taut screenplay & remarkable lead performance, First Blood is one of the most exhilarating examples of its genre that didn't just inspire & influence numerous action films of the 1980s & '90s but is also notable for introducing the world to one of the greatest action heroes of all time who has, since then, become a prominent part of pop culture.Set in a small American town, First Blood tells the story of John Rambo; a Vietnam-war veteran who is in town to visit an old comrade but is intercepted & driven out of the place by an arrogant Sheriff who considers him an unwanted nuisance. When Rambo attempts to re-enter, he's arrested, insulted & abused by the local cops following which he snaps, escapes from the jail, flees into the woods & later unleashes an all-out assault against the town's law enforcement.Directed by Ted Kotcheff, First Blood opens on a calm note which was nothing but a deep breath before the plunge for when the main plot takes over, the film turns into an edge-of- the-seat thriller for the remainder of its runtime. Kotcheff's direction is really impressive for he maintains a steady balance between the action & drama moments, and paces the whole narrative amazingly well. The script is consistently focused on the character of Rambo and without much exposition, tells us all we need to know about him.Using the countryside surroundings to its advantage, First Blood utilises all the available resources in an efficient manner and puts on screen some of the most daring stunts ever filmed. Cinematography encapsulates the whole picture with an overcast feel and concisely captures all the unfolding action with correct implementation of camera angles, movements & lighting. Editing is immaculately carried out for every scene in the final print is relevant to the plot and its 93 minutes of runtime is perfectly paced. And also complimenting the story & uplifting the entire drama is Jerry Goldsmith's fabulous score.Coming to the performances, First Blood features a capable cast in Sylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna & Brian Dennehy and all of them do a brilliant job in their given roles. Stallone, who also co-wrote the screenplay, is the real strength of this film for he delivers a performance that's as rock solid as his character and it's his contribution only that turned Rambo into a cultural icon. Without any words, Stallone is able to convincingly express all the emotions Rambo goes through and that final monologue from him is an instant classic moment in itself. Also, both Crenna & Dennehy chip in with strong supporting work as Rambo's mentor & the town's sheriff, respectively.On an overall scale, First Blood is a fascinating portrait of a troubled soldier who still finds himself haunted by the horrors of the past and covers not only his continuous struggle in readjusting to the normalcy of civilian life but also his hatred for the society he doesn't understand anymore. Rambo is much more than the highly skilled, self-sufficient & extremely lethal assassin for he represents those who had a hard time adapting to the life they weren't familiar with anymore for the addictive taste of war had already altered their identity. Plus, the film also focuses on the lack of understanding between them & the society they're trying to be a part of, which results in their alienation. All in all, First Blood is a timeless masterpiece that will forever be ranked amongst the greatest action films ever made. Strongly recommended.

In fact, I thought that this movie suffered from the same problem as some other literary adaptations that give the impression that they rest too much on their source material and struggle to find their own unity.I've always enjoyed exotic adventure stories, written at a time where a big part of the world could still be a mystery, even if it means putting up with the condescending attitude of the westerners of the time. Of course, today, the Victorian Englishmen are hardly less exotic to us than their oriental contemporaries. I don't know what the tone of Kipling's short story was, but the movie, at least, seemed to me to be watching the protagonists with a distance appropriate for our time, without, however, cutting us completely from any identification or empathy (it would have lost much of its impact otherwise).

Not only did Tarantino establish himself as a great storyteller with the release of Reservoir Dogs, he also gave us a glimpse of his distinct artistic voice that we would anticipate in the years to come. He specifically set a trend in the use of dialogue which reminds us of everyday conversations yet is simultaneously layered with subtext and analogies.The opening sequence establishes Tarantino's master of dialogue perfectly. While the conventional director might open a robbery film with a scene which highlights the plan for the robbery, Tarantino strays away from exposition. Instead, we get a lengthy conversation in which the robbers analyze a song, discuss the ethics of tipping waitresses, and make pop culture references. What does this do? It establishes the characters as human beings and gives them life instead of having the boss merely explain the plot to the robbers, who would substitute for the audience.This might have to do entirely with the fact that the film had a low budget, but Tarantino essentially uses one location for about two thirds of the film. He is still able to establish an intricate and very tense story revolving around the idea that one of the robbers suspects an undercover cop is amongst them. The set design is simple - an abandoned warehouse - so the visual creativity of the film is mostly in the cinematography, but even with that, the heavy use of the warehouse as a setting makes this come across as more of a play, which it should. The dialogue is the driving force of this film, and while the characters may discuss plot at points (I hate it when movies rely on explanations of the plot through dialogue, a la Inception) it is only done when it is necessary. The rest of the dialogue reveals much more about the characters than visuals could provide in this film, and hey, I'm okay with that.One problem I have with the film is the fact that while this film revolves around a group of robbers we never learn too much about two of the robbers since they are hardly in the movie. In fact, one of them only has a few lines in the opening conversation scene of the film. The absence of that character would hardly change the meaning of the film at all, which is why I wish we would have gotten to know him a bit more. I understand side characters, but in a film about a group of robbers, the entire group should have a significant part in the film as an ensemble cast.A great directorial debut for Quentin Tarantino, Reservoir Dogs shines as a surprising hit for a crime film with such a low budget and as a huge influence on the manner of dialogue used in crime films between its release and present day.4.0\/4.0 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 November 2015","score":"","review":" It's very rare that we see a director establish him- or herself as a true talent with their first theatrical release.

But not before he has hacked his way through the staff of the (frankly, understaffed) hospital.And as always, Dr. Loomis is never too far behind trying to figure out Michael's next move.As far as horror sequels go this one is okay. As mentioned above it is a continuation of the same night in the previous movie, and it does a decent job of picking up where it left off in spite of some glaring continuity errors that make it obvious it's the early 80's and not 1978 like it's supposed to be.Halloween II does exactly what horror sequels are supposed to do; up the ante and raise the stakes. It relies more on blood and gore than the first one ever did (Friday the 13th was released in between the first movie and this one and as much as I loathe the Friday the 13th movies, the influence is there), and reveals more about the connection between the characters. In the first movie we are led to believe that Michael's fixation on Laurie is entirely random, but Halloween II reveals that she is actually Michael's long lost sister. Some say that this reveal makes the events of the first movie scarier, others say that it ruins it completely. It's up to you which category you fall into.Donald Pleasance once again brings the sense of foreboding and dread as Dr. Loomis. Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't have much to do as she is confined to a bed for much of the movie and when Michael catches up to Laurie, the chase scene is just a re-tread of the chase from the first movie but in a hospital setting, though she does a good job at being the likable damsel in distress in what screen time she is given.

Another thing that i loved was the theme it's creepy but at the same time it has this Jurassic Park feeling. Everyone did an incredible job with this film it was awesome and i loved it. Jaws had 3 sequels Jaws 2, Jaws 3D and Jaws The Revenge you definitely should see the 2nd one the other 2 not that much. Final Verdict 10 out of 10.

It's on the strange side because the characters are offbeat, but that's not a criticism. That gives the story a unique flavor.The plot or setup takes us into a period when there had been death squads operating who employed foreign mercenaries. Colin Firth plays an insecure momma's boy who runs a theater that shows classic Hollywood films. He lives in this film world, avoids his neighbors, and is devoted to his mentally-unstable mother who is institutionalized. He takes in an American roomer, Hart Bochner, to share his spacious apartment (apartment zero). The other tenants in the building include a frustrated young wife who longs for her father, a transvestite who wants to be accepted as beautiful, and two gossipy old ladies. Bochner ingratiates himself with everyone. Firth's latent homosexuality is reflected in how he caters to Bochner and becomes jealous of his attentions to others. Bochner's bisexuality surfaces. Firth is curious about his background and work.Without explicit sex scenes, the film carefully develops its characters, their longings and their sexual natures. This is a strong focal point of the picture. Firth and Bochner need each other, but each also needs to be who they already are, and that divides them. As each comes under pressure, the results are far from ordinary.

Except Nolte is a fine actor whose talents are largely wasted in this tiresomely Johnny-one-note performance. Powers Boothe, whose on-screen charisma is a match for Nolte's, expresses a broader range as the villain, but apparently never got the big break his talent deserves. Too bad. The movie itself goes downhill after a promising beginning. Director Walter Hill is simply unable to weave the subplots of a murky script by that avatar of violence for its own sake - John Milius - into anything like an engaging whole. The result is a fatal crash dive into gruesomely nonsensical parody of The Wild Bunch. The upshot provides a lesson for those who have the blood lust of a Peckinpah, without his cinematic stylishness or moral sensibility. In fact, the film probably works better as parody, particularly Nolte's cartoonish Texas Ranger. A waste of fine talent on third-rate bravado. Save your time.
