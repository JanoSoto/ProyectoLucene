This one is about a kid who is not the best player in the world and he has an accident. This accident causes his arm to mess up and the tendons to tighten and now he can throw a 100 mph fastball. Well he displays this super ability at a Cubs game where he proceeds to throw a home run ball back into the field of play and before long he is signed with the Cubs giving inspirational speeches, striking out great players and guiding the Cubs to the post season. The Cubs were absolutely not a playoff team when this film was made and to make it out like one kid could turn around the team is completely insane even for movie standards. For one thing he is just a reliever, and a reliever has to have the lead going into the 8th or 9th inning to have any impact on the game and quite frankly I think the Cubs actually had a decent reliever back then. The comedy does not work for me neither did Daniel Stern (who actually directed this movie) as a pitching coach. John Candy is in the film as a play by play guy, but he is not even credited in the cast. Granted I guess if your him you do not need your name to be recognized. On an interesting note you get to see Barry Bonds as a Pirate and before he gained one of those white orbs from Altered Beast and became super big. In fact I think he had actually gotten two of those orbs by the end of his playing days, one more and he would have actually become a wolf man hybrid. Sorry, went off track there, and I am doubting there are a lot of people that will get the reference. In the end, this film might be okay for children. To me though it was just idiotic and just about a complete waste of time.

His idea a minstrel show where black actors paint their faces even blacker (remembering the times when white actors painted their faces to portray black characters because African-Americans were forbidden to act). The boss likes the idea, but Pierre's assistant, Sloan (played by Jada Pinkett-Smith in a good performance) thinks that this is not a good idea, claiming that the audiences would react badly, but she follows his project and they hire two street artist dancers to the show. They change their names to Mantan (Savion Glover) and Sleep 'n Eat (Tommy Davidson). Both of them disagree with some aspects of the show, which contains many unfortunate references to African-Americans, but they stay in the project because they're homeless and they have no money. Like Mantan says If I can dance and make some money that's OK!And the show who had everything against it turns out to be a enormous success making Pierre a influential person in the TV business. But like Tom Petty used to sing, what goes up must comes down and that eventually happened when people starts to complain about the racist and not funny show. One of these people is Sloan's brother (played by Mos Def) leader of an rap group that feels that something must be done to end with the show. In the middle of all this mess are the crisis of conscience of all the characters brought to this controversial matter. Are they doing it only for the money? Self-respect worths nothing? These are some of the questions that this movie shows us. The good aspect of the movie is that Lee puts humor in situations that in real life could be very embarrassing, such as the first meeting between the dancers and the boss, when he says to one of them to dance over the table, while he laughs hysterically, or when he adds ideas to the show, considering himself to be more black than Pierre. But, on the other hand, Lee was ambiguous in saying to the viewers if the minstrel show was intended to be funny or not. When the show was showed in the first time I wasn't laughing at all, thinking that was a strange and almost pointless moment, but then I thought maybe that's the idea, racial stereotypes are only funny if you're at the other side of the audience just like the extras who were applauding to every joke. But to us viewers we're not supposed to laugh because it's not funny, it was just a way to tell that many times TV executives and writers fails to show what's funny and what's not. Many people complained about Damon Wayans french accent saying that it wasn't funny, that it was annoying, but I say that's not true, in fact, this is was a Lee's statement that really works in the movie, because Pierre was an Harvard graduated, so he wanted to pass this white image to his network bosses. A satire as he explained in the beginning period. The first thing that comes to the mind of many viewers of this movie is the countless references to Sidney Lumet's Network (specially in the notable Mantan's protest scene) showing the media power over his spectators, how producers and writers get their ideas to create a show that be appealing to all audiences many times using themes politically incorrect to guarantee high TV ratings. The main difference between Network and Spike Lee's Bamboozled is the way both stories are presented; this time we had lots of black humor and numerous real life references that wasn't showed in Lumet's work. I'm not saying that this movie is a better work than Network, but it's a bold story that puts it very close to the greatness of many controversial movies on the subject. Spike Lee enters this decade with another great movie, but lacks the rage protest of the wonderful Do The Right Thing and don't have many good performances like Malcolm X had. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 March 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Bamboozled tells the story of Pierre Delacroix, a desperate African-American writer (played by Damon Wayans) that needs to create a different show to his white boss (Michael Rapaport) in order to raise the low network's ratings.

No other film can compare to it! Ever since I was six or five I remember in the summer my grandmother bought the movie because I loved dinosaurs at the time. After seeing the movie it inspired me to be a filmmaker at a young age! I love everything about this movie from its effects to its characters and to its story! Jurassic Park is the best movie ever made in my honest opinion. First, the characters are all memorable as I remember each one distinctly when I grew up, Ian Malcolm the insane scientist who as well was a genius too when it came to life and philosophy, one of my favorite characters! Alan Grant, the dinosaur digger (Paleontologist) was also another character who grew very fond and happier through the course of the film as he did not like children but by the end admired and protected the children he was with. Ellie as the love interest and very smart scientist as she adores Alan more throughout the film <3. John Hammond the Walt Disney of Dinosaurs as he is a jolly old Santa like figure only to realize his downfall at the end still liking this character after sacrificing his park to the dinosaurs. The children are children memorable by Tim's spunk and ambition and Lex with her brains and protective views over everyone and everything (the goat). Ray Arnold.. I love Samuel L. Jackson's character he was the head of the tech department of Jurassic Park and had very mad skills with computers and always says a line I love to use, Hold on to your butts. Ned is a very typical villain of the story as he is all about greed as he wants to make dinosaurs of his own but that is his own demise when he is attacked. The other characters as the Lawyer and Hunter are as well good but that's who I remember them as the cool Hunter and greedy Lawyer both desiring a similar trait, gaining much money and destroying these beasts. Second, the story is flat out original! A story about making dinosaurs turning into an adventure horror thriller with two or more subplots concerning the major characters and dinosaurs are shown with great distinction! Third, the CGI in this film I have to say besides Avatar is one of the best CGI created things on cinema. The dinosaurs look so real I can never tell them apart from the machines or even real life! Direction is beautiful as each shot is memorable and almost everything technical in this movie is so beautifully crafted! Finally, the ending. The end of the film was probably one of the best endings ever as it resolves everything and even has the iconic shot of the T-Rex defeating the Raptors as he stands and roars in victory. Every time I watch that shot I always feel great on how the T-Rex came to save the day much like a metaphor to Boo Radley from To Kill A Mockingbird very odd metaphor but Boo hides from the world as the T-Rex hides from the world as well. Boo shoots at the children while the T-Rex attacks the characters during the T-Rex break out of gate scene another awesome scene. Till finally the T-Rex comes to save the day from the Raptors attacking the major characters as Boo stops Bob Ewell from attacking the children. Odd metaphor but I can see it ha ha.

A story about making dinosaurs turning into an adventure horror thriller with two or more subplots concerning the major characters and dinosaurs are shown with great distinction! Third, the CGI in this film I have to say besides Avatar is one of the best CGI created things on cinema. The dinosaurs look so real I can never tell them apart from the machines or even real life! Direction is beautiful as each shot is memorable and almost everything technical in this movie is so beautifully crafted! Finally, the ending. The end of the film was probably one of the best endings ever as it resolves everything and even has the iconic shot of the T-Rex defeating the Raptors as he stands and roars in victory. Every time I watch that shot I always feel great on how the T-Rex came to save the day much like a metaphor to Boo Radley from To Kill A Mockingbird very odd metaphor but Boo hides from the world as the T-Rex hides from the world as well. Boo shoots at the children while the T-Rex attacks the characters during the T-Rex break out of gate scene another awesome scene. Till finally the T-Rex comes to save the day from the Raptors attacking the major characters as Boo stops Bob Ewell from attacking the children. Odd metaphor but I can see it ha ha. Overall this film is a masterpiece and I respect it highly as a great film! 10 out 10 on everything. Great Great Great MOVIE!!

There was something that bothered me. Here is the first scene that bothered me. Homer takes a pot outside to an incinerator, he looks in the pot, there is revulsion. I knew immediately what was in the pot. Shortly thereafter we get the lecture on abortion by Dr. Larch. It did not seem right to me. The lecture did not fit the opening, arrival at a place to gain or lose a child. Later in the movie we are introduced to the actual cider house rules. They are dismissed as something that have not been chosen and absurd and do not have to be followed by those who work in the cider house. Of course, there are real cider house rules, you do not throw a cigarette in the cider! I guess we are supposed to come away with the idea that there are real rules we accept and have to follow and there are other rules that are imposed and mean nothing and we do not need to follow. This is a pretty empty message. There is the scene where Mr. Rose's body is being taken out of the dormitory. We see the migrants sitting on the cider house roof, watching. If they had accepted the rule, and violated it as a tribute, that would have had dramatic impact. The problem with this movie is that in its world there are no rules. The most important scene for me is when Mr. Rose confronts Homer and says we make up the rules every day. This is supposed to be some sort of learning experience for Homer, I guess. You have to watch the scene and decide for yourself. For me this was the worm at the heart of the movie. A rule is not something you make up every day. Rules are something that persist from day to day. Rules are something that a character believes in. Dramatic power does not come out of breaking a rule. Dramatic power does not come out of consequences for breaking a rule. Dramatic power comes out of the agony of a character for breaking a rule. In this movie many rules are broken. I see no torment. I see reaction to consequences, but no internal conflict. Let me put this crudely, Mr. Rose can bang his daughter and that is OK if she acquiesces. When she is fed up and wants to run away and stabs him that is OK too? He will do the right thing and cover up her guilt for the stabbing? What if she had not run away, would he have continued to bang her? This is not a bad movie. It could have been a great movie for me, if it had stuck to the tagline.

Twenty six years later & it's 1995 & Alan's old house has been empty for years until now, until young brother & sister Judy (Kirsten Dunst) & Peter (Bradley Pierce) move in with their aunt Nora (Bebe Neuwirth), the two youngsters find the Jumanji game & start playing it themselves as all manner of creatures & climate events begin to appear as does Alan (Robin Williams) who has spent the last twenty six years trapped inside Jumanji & is now an adult. The only way to reverse the effects of Jumanji is to finish the game so with a now adult Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) the four players must battle whatever Jumanji throw's at them including Lions, Monsoon's, giant Spider's & a stampede...Girected by former special effects man Joe Johnston this oddball fantasy adventure is actually pretty good but there are one or two things that ultimately drag it down to merely a very good film rather than a great film in my opinion. Based on the 1981 book by Chris Van Allsberg the film is apparently quite different & the two main character's here Alan & Sarah don't even appear in the book, Jumanji is a hard film to categorise as it mixes various ideas & themes like a bad childhood, finding redemption, standing up to your fears, fantasy, sci-fi, horror & comedy. At 100 odd minutes it moves along at a good pace, once it gets going the situation just keeps getting worse & worse as all the chaos & mayhem escalates beyond anyone's control with all sorts of animals running around & the theme of facing your fears is an ever present one. I am not sure there is another film quite like Jumanji & to find something so original & different in a mainstream film is unusual but the CGI effects scenes, the lack of character depth, the refusal to do anything with the plot other than destroy a house & an ultra happy ending which goes on forever that gives every character in the film the best most happy ending is pure Hollywood that was not needed & a slightly darker ending in keeping with the slightly darker tone of the film overall would have been much better. To be honest apart from great set-pieces & the basic concept there's really not that much to Jumanji at all, it's rather shallow & it's attempts at depth are pure heavy handed Hollywood cliché but it's fun & very entertaining while it lasts, just a shame about the last ten minutes really.Jumanji was made just as the CGI computer graphic revolution was taking off back in the mid 90's but the effects do hold up rather well actually, from huge plants to an impressive stampede of Rhino's & Elephant's through a house to a huge Lion with the mischievous Monkey's probably the only real weak effect. As a fairly light hearted fantasy adventure with some darker overtones there's a few amusing moments including a bemused policeman who's car is slowly & systematically trashed & as a whole the film delights in needless destruction & mayhem which is no bad thing. There are some laughs & a few scares as well & I could definitely see Jumanji appealing to both older & younger audiences.With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 this had a very healthy amount spent on it with most going towards the effects I would have thought. Filmed in New Hampshire & British Columbia in Canada. Despite being known as a manic performer Robin Williams is pretty restrained here & his brand of psychical comedy isn't used much, Kirsten Dunst is one of the few child stars to go on & have a successful adult career while the acting generally is pretty good.Jumanji is a unique fantasy adventure that I think would appeal to both children & adults, my only real problem is the sweeter than sweet happier than happy ending which is pure sentimental Hollywood at it's worst. With an ending more in keeping with the rest of the film Jumanji might have got a seven from but as it is it gets a six, good but not great. Followed by Zathura A Space Adventure (2005) which was shot under the title Jumanji 2.

At 100 odd minutes it moves along at a good pace, once it gets going the situation just keeps getting worse & worse as all the chaos & mayhem escalates beyond anyone's control with all sorts of animals running around & the theme of facing your fears is an ever present one. I am not sure there is another film quite like Jumanji & to find something so original & different in a mainstream film is unusual but the CGI effects scenes, the lack of character depth, the refusal to do anything with the plot other than destroy a house & an ultra happy ending which goes on forever that gives every character in the film the best most happy ending is pure Hollywood that was not needed & a slightly darker ending in keeping with the slightly darker tone of the film overall would have been much better. To be honest apart from great set-pieces & the basic concept there's really not that much to Jumanji at all, it's rather shallow & it's attempts at depth are pure heavy handed Hollywood cliché but it's fun & very entertaining while it lasts, just a shame about the last ten minutes really.Jumanji was made just as the CGI computer graphic revolution was taking off back in the mid 90's but the effects do hold up rather well actually, from huge plants to an impressive stampede of Rhino's & Elephant's through a house to a huge Lion with the mischievous Monkey's probably the only real weak effect. As a fairly light hearted fantasy adventure with some darker overtones there's a few amusing moments including a bemused policeman who's car is slowly & systematically trashed & as a whole the film delights in needless destruction & mayhem which is no bad thing. There are some laughs & a few scares as well & I could definitely see Jumanji appealing to both older & younger audiences.With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 this had a very healthy amount spent on it with most going towards the effects I would have thought. Filmed in New Hampshire & British Columbia in Canada. Despite being known as a manic performer Robin Williams is pretty restrained here & his brand of psychical comedy isn't used much, Kirsten Dunst is one of the few child stars to go on & have a successful adult career while the acting generally is pretty good.Jumanji is a unique fantasy adventure that I think would appeal to both children & adults, my only real problem is the sweeter than sweet happier than happy ending which is pure sentimental Hollywood at it's worst. With an ending more in keeping with the rest of the film Jumanji might have got a seven from but as it is it gets a six, good but not great.

Twenty six years later & it's 1995 & Alan's old house has been empty for years until now, until young brother & sister Judy (Kirsten Dunst) & Peter (Bradley Pierce) move in with their aunt Nora (Bebe Neuwirth), the two youngsters find the Jumanji game & start playing it themselves as all manner of creatures & climate events begin to appear as does Alan (Robin Williams) who has spent the last twenty six years trapped inside Jumanji & is now an adult.

One is the organizer, one is the chain-smoking wild-card that continually impresses the ladies, yet has a stronger passion for the keys. It won't take a rocket scientist to realize which is which based on mere talent alone. Throw into the mix a husky female singer, a mistaken love, and chaos between a seemingly stable piano act. As our film winds down, cliché over recycled cliché is used to tear these brothers apart, and slowly bring them back together &#x96; in an awkward way. While the film boasts collaboration between two of Hollywood's biggest brothers (one a recent Oscar winner), great piano music, and the quintessential red-dress-on-piano scene, what this film actually delivers is merely a tired script, an overused plot devise, and lines that could have been promoted by anyone with an Acting 101 degree. While the concept seems dramatic, the final result of this feature (despite the numerous awards) felt disappointing. Brotherly love destroyed by inevitable change? There were a couple of small elements to this film that worked, ensuring that The Fabulous Baker Boys was more than just a one-star movie. Bridges, muscled down by the day-to-day life of being a piano player, is watchable. His apathy towards all situations coupled with his Joe Cool smoking-attitude, creates the correct amount of tension with unknown to keep the plot slowly moving in the right direction. Beau, the weaker big-screen actor (better able to manage the television roles), tries to keep up, but what tries to be anger ends up just being a man with big eyes and anger-spit. But, on with the positives&#x85;the Bridges' music was, for lack of a better word, fabulous. Without making the guess if it was them playing, the tone of each of the songs respectively worked in their scenes. Along with the music, the visions of LA worked to show that in a city that never sleeps, these two brothers will always have work. Keep the drinks flowing, and you are sure to be a crowd pleaser.With some slight parts to make you enjoy the hour and a half of a band's destruction, the rest just crumbled quickly. To begin, while the pairing of Beau and Jeff seemed powerful on paper, the screen told otherwise. Absolutely, the two were able to play their respective roles well &#x96; Jeff the darkened, smoking, looming brother &#x96; while Beau played the optimist, looking to keep his dream (or business) alive. The issue with the Bridges' is that they are too far apart. There is never a scene to show their chemistry together as amazing pianists. Instead, we see through posters that at once they were happy, but those days are long gone. We begin our film on a downtrodden note, and it never quite picks itself up from that even when the brothers seem to be back on top again. Director Steve Kloves never gives us, the audience, an opportunity to cheer for Jeff and Beau's happiness. Instead, we are forced to suffer right along with them, picking ourselves up after each depressing hour. The same can be said for Pfeiffer, and while Oscar-nomination, Golden Globe-winning, still means something &#x96; her portrayal of Susie Diamond just wasn't breakthrough enough to be remembered after 1990. The prostitute-turned-singer routine has been done in Hollywood, over and over and over; and not to sound repetitive, better. Pfeiffer's husky voice (at times in tune, at times not), and butch demeanor, did create a sex-symbol, but instead another tragic character. While I agree, the story isn't conducive to happiness; somebody should have considered it as an opportunity to see these characters differently. It would have added a new layer to their characters, allowing for a stronger emotional punch at the end.As our characters floundered through their roles, playing piano and off-beat singing, the story was another part that just fell short &#x96; forcing our characters to have mixed material to work with and missed character opportunity. The Fabulous Baker Boys as a film doesn't work, as a television mini-series perhaps it would have been better. There is too much left on the table from writer-director Kloves that nothing evolves. Scenes like upstairs neighbor of Jeff's that is like his mother, busting the dog out of the vet, smelling bathroom equipment, and destroying memorabilia, look good on paper, but without the correct backing just doesn't feel finished. That is the overall feel with Baker Boys, a sense that scenes, moments, and plot-points went unfinished. Kloves isn't the best in handling the talent he has hired. From leaving cameramen in shots to overusing the piano music, Kloves believes in his work (there is no argument there), but his execution is fallible. Why would you use piano music as your theme music when the Bridges are playing piano music as well? This was horrible. With strong keys being played by the brothers, the cheesy background music just diluted the overall feel. It is the perfect example of having authentic reality and a cheap knock-off. With lacking characters, it would be up to Kloves to cover the differences, but he can't control what is happening. His camera direction, musical focus, and story have too many flawed plot holes that instead of a creative story, we are left with a sad overused cliché. I would agree that these boys are Fabulous, but Kloves couldn't prove it. His scientific directional equation remains a hypothesis.Overall, I wasn't a fan of this film. Our mood, music, and plot points were all misused and poorly developed. Our story, cliché after cliché, didn't feel original or exciting. There needed to be some brightness at the end of our tunnel, but nobody could demonstrate this.

For what it's worth Airport 75 is a watchable effort, but nothing going out of your way to see. If you have a preference for a more action orientated entry, I'd choose this over the original if I were you.5\/10 ","genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"16 March 2010","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" A Madison Avenue advertising executive, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), is mistaken for a Mr. George Kaplan and kidnapped by thugs Valerian (Adam Williams) and Licht (Robert Ellenstein).

It showcased what was then groundbreaking special effects and combined the talents of producer Steven Spielberg and director Tobe Hooper. The story is extremely simple. A family begins to experience intense poltergeist activity in their home. It begins innocuously enough and then spirals out of control in increasingly more deadly ways. Paranormal specialists are then brought in to record and explain the nature of the phenomena, which turns out to be related to an old disturbed graveyard.Looking back, it's quite difficult to see what all the fuss was about with this movie. While it doesn't exactly take long for spooky supernatural events to occur, they aren't always executed for maximum effectiveness. A case in point involves the single best moment in the film. The scene in question is when the mother is in the kitchen an turns her back for a couple of seconds only to then turn back and see all of the dining room chairs perched up on the breakfast table. It's an extremely simple and brilliant idea; a very scary way to show a supernatural presence. However, instead of building on this tension, the film proceeds to next show the mother placing her daughter in the middle of the floor in an American football helmet, and laughing joyously as her little girl is propelled across the floor by some unknown supernatural force. It just deflates the tension and doesn't ring true. And to a certain extent this happens too often in the early stages of the film, where the threat is dealt with in a far too unconcerned manner. It's really only when the film-makers decide to treat their poltergeists as a genuine malevolent threat that the film starts to pick up momentum. And everything does eventually end in a crescendo of otherworldly mayhem.Much debate has ensued regarding whether Poltergeist is primarily a work of Spielberg or Hooper. Certainly on the face of it, it seems more indebted to Spielberg's style, with its story of an everyman family battling the odds against evil. It certainly doesn't seem to bear too many of the hallmarks of the director of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. But I guess we shall never know, and I suppose ultimately this is an example of a collaborative effort where the producer is a hugely powerful film director in his own right. But forget those two creative forces for a minute because in many respects the real star of the show is the late Heather O'Rourke who is perfect as the little girl who is a conduit for the evil spirits. Her real-life early death is well documented but it is nevertheless a terrible tragedy.Overall, this is a decent enough horror film; it's just that it hasn't aged as well as some others from the same time. This may have something to do with it being so indebted to its special effects, which by today's standards aren't anything remarkable. If you're a fan of mainstream 80's movies though, then this one could be of interest.
