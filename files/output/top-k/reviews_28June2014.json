It's funny, poignant and has a spectacular cast.I can't get enough of Paul Reiser's character, Modell. Good Golly he's funny.Discussing the concept of evolution, Reiser speaks one of my favorite lines, The guy who makes up this stuff it's the stupidest thing I've ever heard - people do not come from swamps. They come from Europe.This line comes from potentially the best post-movie credit sequence I've ever seen (or rather, heard). It's a philosophical comedic audio layover, a bonus diner conversation; an adequate apology for the abrupt freeze-frame ending.I love how Reiser's constantly hassling Steve Guttenberg's character for rides. They're all such close friends, Reiser manages to never actually ask for the lift, he always gets The Gute to offer.A young Mickey Rourke is almost unrecognizable in this film. And he delivers a spectacular performance.Daniel Stern's character is also great, now that I think about it. You know him from Home Alone. His character is such a well-meaning fella. When he argues with his wife over his records, you don't know who to root for, and it'll set your heart-strings aquiver.It can get dusty at times.Stern also has a great moment with Guttenberg, when he explains that getting married doesn't necessarily make life any easier.Kevin Bacon's character is, as always, excellently executed. He is like a tightly wound spring, but worth much more than first appears.The minor character who memorizes the lines from Sweet Smell of Success, cracks me up every time he interrupts a conversation.I'm not sure if women will enjoy this film as much as men. The themes seem very masculine; they reflect the subtleties of my interactions with my male friends. I'd be interested to hear if women feel like they really connect with certain aspects of the movie.One might say Diner is misogynistic.I say, Feh!One could argue that the pacing is slow at the beginning, but personally, I won't do so.The only criticism I can muster is about the moment of most tension, the pinnacle of the film's conflict. It gets resolved in such a quick fashion it might make your head tilt.Otherwise, this is a spectacular film.As always, don't expect too much, and you'll be oh-so-sweetly rewarded.

After the intense finale of Aliens (1986), Ripley is again thrusted into a world of monsters and further emotional turmoil (survivors guilt perhaps?). Stuck on a prison planet full of men and unfortunately the monsters have also followed her here, can she pull a hat trick?A lot of the inmates can be interesting characters, but most of them are without a doubt dull. I didn't care for them like I did the marines of Aliens, and it all feels like a stupid joke compared to how great the first two movies managed to do well with even less. Surprisingly what I do like in this film is how run down everything looks, the prison has aged and been left to rot with the trash inhabiting it. All of this makes for some surprisingly good POV shots from the Alien and when implemented for the first time, it's very effective.Final Verdict Funny enough, it's not skimpy women running from a killer and I apologise for keep referring to the previous movies.

The plot lines are very similar.Both films are about a silent movie star, an annoying actress on her way out, and a cute young up-and-comer with a lot of potential. Both are set in Hollywood during the transition between silent movies and talkies.SITR specifically is set in 1927, and Gene Kelly plays Don Lockwood, Donald O'Connor co-stars as his best friend Cosmo Brown and Debbie Reynolds plays Kathy Selden.If you haven't seen it, check it out! But beware the spoilers below.First of all, this movie is primarily a satire. A very well-made one.The different scenes moving through partially built film sets, are spectacular and fascinating. From the very beginning, with the violin performance between Don and Cosmo, the various duets and dances they perform are exceptional.Cosmo is easily my favorite part of the film. Every once in awhile, it's nice to have a reliable and unconflicted deuteragonist (the side kick or best friend character) behind the protagonist. Donald O'Connor turns in a remarkable performance, with several solo dances.The film is so self-referential that the fourth wall is sort of perpetually broken throughout.

I forget right away.There are a lot of pop culture references to this movie.In The Lion King, Timon and Pumba do a hula dance that is reminiscent of the raincoat scene during the song, Good Morning, in Singin'.I'm pretty certain The Artist is an homage in its entirety. The plot lines are very similar.Both films are about a silent movie star, an annoying actress on her way out, and a cute young up-and-comer with a lot of potential. Both are set in Hollywood during the transition between silent movies and talkies.SITR specifically is set in 1927, and Gene Kelly plays Don Lockwood, Donald O'Connor co-stars as his best friend Cosmo Brown and Debbie Reynolds plays Kathy Selden.If you haven't seen it, check it out! But beware the spoilers below.First of all, this movie is primarily a satire. A very well-made one.The different scenes moving through partially built film sets, are spectacular and fascinating. From the very beginning, with the violin performance between Don and Cosmo, the various duets and dances they perform are exceptional.Cosmo is easily my favorite part of the film. Every once in awhile, it's nice to have a reliable and unconflicted deuteragonist (the side kick or best friend character) behind the protagonist. Donald O'Connor turns in a remarkable performance, with several solo dances.The film is so self-referential that the fourth wall is sort of perpetually broken throughout. I'm not certain if they ever actually commit to it.But when Cosmo (who fills in as a screenwriter, audio recording jockey, etc. throughout) takes over for the conductor at the end of the film, it's a pretty direct nod to the audience that everything is off the rails.He cracks some of the best jokes, and is the source of the majority of the humor.At one point Don and Cosmo are speaking with the studio head. The man says to Cosmo, Remind me to make you a screenwriter. Cosmo hands him one of his own cigars and later on the man says, Remind me to give you a raise.Towards the end of the film, when the studio head becomes an antagonist, Cosmo says, I once gave you a cigar. Can I have it back?It wasn't his cigar to begin with! Hilarious, right?To conclude this glowing review, I'll end with a quote from Don while he courts Kathy.

Following the wrong path and looking up to the wrong version of a truly good human being is a great way to become lost and destroyed. 'American History X' tells the story of two brothers in Venus Beach, California who get enthralled in the modern day Neo-Nazi crime. Derek Vineyard (played blisteringly by Edward Norotn) grew up as a bright young man with strong passions and great qualities. However, being highly influenced by his fathers prejudice views and death caused by an African-American, he turned into a skinhead who after beating three black men in a basketball game is targeted as revenge due to tension of the game. The leader of the men is Derek's main rival, and when Derek storms out shooting, he leaves two brutally killed and one escaped. After wounding one of the two men, he brutally kills him which causes his arrest. After being released from jail, his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who highly looks up to Derek as a leader has turned into the younger version of Derek, who is angry due to the higher population of non-Caucasian's in his neighborhood. He looks at Derek as a hero and is full of anger. As Derek tries to teach Danny his new ways, his past comes back to haunt the both of them. Racism is a degrading view that is acted on in our country, and that is the catalyst for this masterpiece. It isn't making a big political statement, it's just showing how some scary people view the diversity of our country and what it does to peoples lives. The brotherhood between Danny and Derek is very touching and shows how important guidance and setting a good example is. The realism and the power this film offsets is what makes this film touching. It doesn't end all happy and clean. It serves as a warning for doing what is right and how your actions can ruin your life. A touch of beauty is portrayed at last to give a little hope though. Edward Norton's performance is so special because he plays two different personalities. The before and post skinhead is a sweet and likable character who you will most likely be moved by. However, when he is shown in flashbacks as a skinhead, he is pure evil and full of dirty words and views. Tony Kaye's directing is very special because of the color and motion he shoots in. During flashbacks in which Derek is a racist, he uses black and white to set the dark mood and color for when he has redeemed himself. The slow-motion scenes are very beautiful and gripping, as well as the cinematography around the beach which serves as a metaphor. The intensity is strong in the scenes that contain necessary violence. This film shows the views of insane people, but shows how 'bad people' can redeem themselves and how that their is reasoning for what they do. The story is also a wake-up call for people down the wrong path and how your life could be ruined due to your actions. This is a very powerful and gripping work of art done perfectly to give the audience the affect they deserve.

The brothers discover the orphanage in which they grew up in is about to be closed unless they can raise the money to keep it open. So they go on a mission from God to put their old band back together and throw a big concert to raise the money.Highly entertaining comedy with some kick-ass music. This was John Landis' first great movie, in my opinion. Belushi and Aykroyd are wonderful. The supporting cast is first-rate. How about that car chase?

As Aliens escape and then the prisoners Earthlings have a hard time figuring out the whereabout of the heinous beings that are running amok . Spectacular sequel with twisted intrigue , disgusting special effects and lots of blood and gore . This horrifying as well as heart-pounding movie contains shocks , stomach-churning violence , chills , profanity , thrills and results to be pretty entertaining . This nail-biting picture contains tension from start to finish , gory scenes aplenty , thrills , some strong scares , slime , emotion , entertainment and good acting . It is a superb cinematic combination of Sci-Fi , monster movie and terror . This is a brutal , considerable violent and exciting sci-fi thriller that scales new heights of savagery even by the standards of the 70s , 80s and 90s. The result is a throughly violent but undeniably thrilling action movie with a strong cast giving sweatily good value to their abrasive characters .The concept by Vincent Ward based on which the movie was green-lighted involved an artificially constructed wooden planetoid and a group of monks who thought they were living in post-apocalyptic dark ages, and had a middle-ages lifestyle ; the group refused all kinds of modern technology, and when Ripley and the Alien crash-land on it, they would blame Ripley for the Alien attacks. Spectacular as well as bloody slaughter sequences took long time to shoot and were extremely difficult to make . Magnificently designed creatures , originally created by the artist HR Giger . The ending part is particularly exciting with Sigourney Weaver battling the malicious alien and with breathtaking scenes that took various weeks to film . The original budget was $45 million which included Sigourney Weaver's fee of $5.5 million , the budget soon spiraled however, with first Renny Harlin and then Vincent Ward both leaving the project before novice feature film director David Fincher came on board . Sigourney Weaver had a clause in her contract specifying that Walter Hill and David Giler would write the final shooting script. Weaver has said that she considers Ripley a very difficult character to write, and, with the exception of James Cameron, only Giler and Hill have really ever written the character correctly. The picture packs an original music by Elliot Goldenthal , plenty of frightening and moving sounds . Colorful and adequate cinematography by Alex Thomson , this cinematographer replaced Jordan Cronenweth after only two weeks of filming, after he began to suffer the onset of Parkinson's Disease . Sets were toned down in scale and a more claustrophobic shooting approach with a lot of close-ups to characters' faces was taken . On the set at Pinewood Studios, a giant lead foundry took 12 weeks to construct and put the production way behind . In wide shots, most of the refinery is actually made of cardboard . The motion picture was professionally directed by David Fincher and spent over a year in editing . Although this was first-time director David Fincher disowned the film, citing constant studio interference and actually walked out of production before editing began. Because of continuing troubles with the film, Fox halted production in Pinewood Studios in England in late 1991 ; the crew returned to LA, and an initial screening identified the missing parts of the film. A major part yet to be shot included killing of the alien in the lead pool .The gaps between the four Alien films steadily decreased.

Moreover, the film never becomes ludicrously unbelievable, like modern thrillers or action films.The film is short and sweet at a lean 93 minutes and was shot in New York City and Tucson, Arizona.GRADE A ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"}]
