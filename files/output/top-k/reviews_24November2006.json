How many movies can you watch that many times and the movie remains just as perfect, just as entertaining, just as enthralling and fascinating each time you watch it? Very few, that's for sure! Gloria Swanson was simply perfection in this movie. What a brilliant casting move on Billy Wilder's part! And what a performance Swanson gave. Her theatrics and eye movements were so dead-on ... but then what else could we expect from a genuine mega-star from the silent screen era, playing a faded mega-star from the silent screen era? What a totally unself-conscious portrayal. One of the best screen portrayals ever, in my opinion.Von Stroheim as the butler \/ former silent director ... again, genius. Erich von Stroheim made some GREAT pictures in his day, I mean VERY GREAT (can you say Greed?), but ended up on the outs in Hollywood thanks to his legendary ego and his battles with Thalberg. How perfect to get a dethroned former major silent director to play a has-been silent director! Remember, it may be de rigeur nowadays for actors to play characters that mock their former selves (a la William Shatner and his newfound popularity), but this was half a century ago when Billy Wilder and Gloria Swanson and von Stroheim pioneered this type of tongue-in-cheek, knowing self-referentialism.And William Holden ... handsome, sarcastic, jaded, sexy-voiced William Holden as the down-and-out writer who turns gigolo. His character is only about 30 years old, but already the Hollywood system has chewed him up and spit him out. He can't even pay his rent or his car loan.

It refers, in fact, to a programme during the Second World War when the US armed forces made use of a secret spoken code based upon the Navajo language. The idea was that native Navajo speakers would be trained both as code-speakers and as radio operators so that they could broadcast battlefield messages that could not be understood by the enemy. Although the code is sometimes described as unbreakable, many experts believe that it could have been broken by a skilled cryptographer who was also a fluent Navajo speaker, which explains why it was used only in the Pacific theatre of war. Comparative linguistics is something of a national sport in Germany and the Germans, unlike the Japanese, had plenty of linguists and anthropologists with knowledge of Native American languages.The story of the code-speakers is a potentially fascinating one, although not perhaps one that could easily be told through the medium of film, unless it was a film made in Navajo for speakers of that language. Windtalkers revolves around the relationship between two men, the code-talker Private Ben Yahzee and Sergeant Joe Enders (an Italian-American despite his Scandinavian-sounding name) who has been assigned to him as his bodyguard. (Most of the action takes place during the American assault on the island of Saipan in June and July 1944). What Yahzee doesn't know is that Enders has been ordered to protect the code at all costs, which means that, if necessary, he will kill Yahzee to prevent him from falling into enemy hands.Windtalkers uses the buddy-buddy format, a familiar plot device in both war films and other genres (such as cop dramas). In keeping with the normal conventions of this format, the two main characters have diametrically opposed characters. The rookie Yahzee is idealistic, polite and friendly, a happily-married family man. Enders is a cynical, hard-bitten, battle-scarred veteran. They start off disliking one another, but develop a mutual respect which turns to friendship. Eventually the two become so close that Enders realises that he will not be able to kill Yahzee if duty demands it.The actual mechanics of the spoken code might have been difficult to convey in an English-language movie, but I was disappointed with Windtalkers because other potentially interesting themes were ignored or treated perfunctorily. The tone is notably patriotic, with the Navajo soldiers depicted as even more ardent American patriots than their white counterparts. (Significantly, Yahzee's young son is named George Washington Yahzee). The film does not explore the issue of what motivates the Navajo to fight for America, a country into which they were forcibly incorporated in the nineteenth century, whose watchword seemed to be government of the white man, for the white man, by the white man and which in the 1940s still treated American Indians as second-class citizens.One theme that the film does treat is, of course, that of racism. Indeed, some critics such as James Berardinelli have criticised it for dealing with this theme in a too heavy-handed manner. We see the Navajo soldiers being abused by racist whites, and then saving the life of one of those who have abused them. War films, however, strike me as being a curious vehicle for propagating anti-racist views; war, after all, is about fighting people who belong to a nation other than one's own, and in this film the Japanese are simply presented as the enemy, to be slaughtered with a clear conscience. The message of an anti-racist war film seems to be that to abuse a man because of the colour of his skin is wrong, to kill him because of the colour of his passport is acceptable.There are some occasional fine directorial touches, such as the scene where we see a butterfly above the surface of a stream, which then slowly turns red with blood as a corpse floats into view, juxtaposing the beauties of nature with the horrors of war. There are, however, also some remarkably silly scenes, such as the one where Yahzee poses as a Japanese soldier and Enders as his prisoner so that they can capture a radio-set from the enemy. Adam Beach might look like a Jap to a bigoted soldier who cannot tell one non-Caucasian race from another, but I doubt if the Japanese themselves would have been fooled.Second World War movies were something of a rarity in the eighties and early nineties, but have made a modest comeback since the success of Saving Private Ryan, and Windtalkers seems to have been modelled on the earlier film. The advance of special-effects technology means that it is now much easier to create realistic battle scenes, and John Woo follows Stephen Spielberg's lead with plenty of graphic scenes of carnage. The film, however, is less successful than Saving Private Ryan; that film had its faults, but the battle scenes had an immediacy and emotional impact much greater than anything in Windtalkers. If Spielberg's film is a flawed epic, Woo's is little more than a standard wartime action movie. It is also, at about 2¼ hours in length, rather too long-winded, which gives an unfortunate sense to the title. 5\/10.

Its Not great but it is different and as original of an idea as you can get. I watched it as a kid and yes I thought it was odd it didn't have Myers, but not everything to do with Halloween has to do with him. I thought perhaps it was a movie having nothing to do with the others and didn't pay any attention to directors and sequels etc when I was young and first started watching films.Season Of The Witch is a very unique movie about a strange old man who for some reason wants to kill little children by using their masks. My only argument was that there were three masks to choose from and I am sure that, unlike tickle me elmo, not all the kids would want one. Who wants to look like everyone else.This movie always entertained me as a kid and I will always continue to watch it when I watch the Halloween series. It is a nice break between the Michael Myers films which all look the same if you watch them back to back.Tommy Lee Wallace did an amazing job writing and directing it and I am a fan of his work. I mean he wrote Amityville The possession which is one of the scariest movies ever made.This Halloween was suppose to be a new direction. Myers was dead and Carpenter wanted to release a new movie every year with a new Halloween theme, but all these stupid people started whining wheres Michael Myers where is Dr. Loomis Wheres Jamie Lee and they never gave this movie a chance - it shows that people who did that aren't very intelligent cause this was a pretty good movie - so I urge people to get their head out of their ass and watch this movie as Season Of The Witch and forget Myers for five minutes and with all the sequels and all the crappy remakes and Hollywood garbage being fed to us these days you should appreciate something original like this!!!

As a rule, I only watch comedies once because they tend not to age well. But I can watch this movie all day. I also tend to cringe when I hear about Hollyweird making a movie that is set in the Deep South. But this movie does a fairly accurate portrayal of Alabama as I knew it when I was a kid (I live in Maryland now.). I was very impressed with the movie's portrayal of Alabamians without stereotyping them. It's true, many Alabamians think New Yorkers are as stupid as they think we are, and the movie brought that out very well.Fred Gwynne's last role as the no-nonsense Alabama judge was one for the ages. He didn't exaggerate the Southern accent, in fact, he sounded like one of my uncles. I was almost convinced he was from the South until I read somewhere that he was originally from New York City. Very impressive, Mr. Munster. I only have two minor criticisms of the movie. Here goes (OOps. Sorry. Forgot. POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT) (1) Joe Pesci's character would not have gotten out of that pool hall the first time without at least three or four of those guys ganging up on him and giving him a good old fashioned Alabama butt whuppin'! They would have sent him packing, and if he survived the experience, he would never go back in there again. Him decking that redneck after two or three meetings with him would not happen, assuming he lives through the first encounter. There would be no two or three meetings.(2) I would like to have seen a scene where Joe Pesci and the Alabama D.A. go deer hunting and Joe Pesci dresses up in that ridiculous outfit he wore. I would love to have seen them expand on the idea that when you go deer hunting in Alabama, you wear a sturdy pair of jeans, a warm flannel shirt, and some sturdy work shoes or boots, not an outfit that makes you look like you're taking a stroll down Broadway or something. (Yes, folks, it does get cold in Alabama, believe it or not. Sometimes, it even gets below thirty.)Except for these little things, a great movie.

What is remarkable about this film is not only the screenplay but the remarkable ability of director Sergio Leone to create three movies in one with disregard to any chronological sequence of events. I have seen the movie two times in one week and I still have to watch it over a couple of times to fully understand the message.The most dramatic part of the movie is towards the end, when Noodles decides to call the police hoping that Max would be arrested and therefore give up his plan to rob the Federal Reserve Bank, a complete suicidal act. Upon his call the police comes and his friends are killed, than Eve, his girlfriend is murdered by the police.The movie begins in 1933 and ends with the same scene, with Noodles played by de Niro smoking opium on the bed at the Chinese place. This led a number of critics to the conclusion that actually Noodles is fantasizing about his future and I think this interpretation is correct. His devilish smile at the end of the movie is probably one of the most enigmatic pieces in filmography. Why is he smiling about? He just called the police and gave-in his friends who died in a shootout. is he smiling because everything is over, like some critics argue? I don't think so. He didn't seem unhappy up to this point, or at least not that desperate to explain such an emotion. Is it because he failed? I think this could be a possible answer. He was telling Fat Moe You can always tell winners and losers and he thought himself a loser. So the hysterical smile can be connected to a resignation in face of his fate. Logically, the movie should end in 1968. In a way or another. But it ends, strangely in 1933 with Noodles on a dose of opium and with a mysterious smile on his face. I think he dies that night along with his friends, the rest being just a premonition of what would happen if he stayed alive. The fact that Max survives in his fantasy is only one more reason to see it as a fantasy. Max was more than a friend, they seemed connected in life and death and the fact that Noodles was seeing him again in 1968 is just a projection of this close relationship, his brain refusing to accept that he practically murdered his best friend along with his other two childhood friends and his girlfriend Eve.The fact is even more dramatic and striking as you see the friendship of these boys starting in a harsh neighbourhood in the 20s and you see them sticking together ten years later. Noodles tries to save them but instead he kills them. His smile is only an ironical resignation of his failure.

Seriously.Joe Eszterhaus wrote this, and the theme takes one sentence. (It is my above sentence). Basically if you want to see good drama concerning Las Vegas, watch Leaving Las Vegas (Elisabeth Shue, Nicolas Cage). If you need a laugh, watch this.We have Elizabeth Berkley (sadly for her an early attempt at drama, this was not all her fault). Alan Rachins with a few choice lines as a sleazy producer. Kyle MacLachlan, Gina Gershon,(who has recently been in a few episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm proving she can do comedy).Overall there is a sadistic mob boss, more sleazy producers; I am sure you get the gist of it.

I've seen enough of his films to know one thing about him. All he cares about is visual style. There's no substance to his stories when you get beneath all the flair and breathtaking cinematography. And after what he did to the Batman franchise. That was just unforgivable. His two entries are completely awful compared to Tim Burtons. Burton is a director who also has a keen eye for visuals, but in his vision of Batman, he was able to tie the visuals into the dark psychology of the characters. Schumacher by comparison turned Batman into an overinflated freak-show.Still, occasionally Schumacher can turn out decent films, especially ones where he tones down his flamboyant style. Films like Falling Down and Phone Booth were very good, because he seemed to care about those protagonists. And in the case of Flatliners, Schumacher attempts to meld his theatricality with people we can empathise with. With limited success.Flatliners has a great deal of potential. The trailer sold me on it when I saw it back in 1990. The film attempts to answer the age old question...what lies beyond death? There are a great many angles Flatliners could have explored in one of life's greatest mysteries. But unfortunately, it only scratches the surface, and instead gives us simplistic solutions to lofty dilemmas.Focusing on five medical students, Nelson Wright (Kiefer Sutherland), Rachel Mannus (Julia Roberts), David Labraccio (Kevin Bacon), Joe Hurley (William Baldwin) and Randy Steckle (Oliver Platt), they band together for a highly risky (not to mention reckless) experiment.Nelson is obsessed with death, and comes up with the idea of simulating it. Stopping his heart for a few minutes, and basically seeing what will happen. One by one, they go through with it (except for Randy, the only one with any brains), recklessly betting for longer periods of time, until they are revived. Each one has an experience. Usually unpleasant childhood memories. As well as the sins of their past.Although all are successfully revived, their near-death experience has consequences. By going somewhere they had no place going, their long forgotten pasts manifest in the present. And want retribution.Flatliners is a fairly creepy film. There's no question about that. Schumacher manages to invest the film with an unsettling atmosphere. Like in the case of Nelson, he is haunted by the spirit of a child he accidentally killed. A child who is very peeved to say the least. There's a marvellously paranoid sequence when Nelson is in David's van, and briefly sees the boy outside. He shuts all the windows. Locks all the doors. Only to find he's locked himself in with his pint-sized stalker. And the brief image of night cyclists passing through Nelson like they were apparitions is eerie to say the least.But as usual with Schumacher, he gets carried away with the visuals. Some parts of the film are drenched in neon colours as if we're experiencing a supernatural acid trip instead of a horror film. Although I liked the moment in Julia Roberts' experience where she makes peace with her late father, and the colour of the room changes reflecting upon the mood of the moment.But elsewhere, the emotional payoffs for the characters are contrived and utterly predictable. David is tormented by a girl he used to pick on, and his moment of redemption is simply to ask for forgiveness. Which is the same with Nelson. The fact it signifies the end is such a lame cop-out. I was really disappointed with the film's lack of imagination. In the case of Joe, his personal torment is different girls he made love to while secretly videotaping them. His story arc gets no closure, as if Schumacher lost interest in it.Despite the intensifying nature of their personal horrors, its difficult to sympathise with people who are really a bunch of reckless thrill-seekers not fit to be called doctors. In the case of Oliver Platt's character, he arguably gives the best performance of the five. Because he is the only one who sees what's really happening. His sense of moral outrage at the events is the closest the film gets to thought-provoking.Although Flatliners has impressive set design with Gothic cathedral architecture, an oppressive atmosphere and a wonderfully haunting musical score, its essentially undone by Schumacher's preoccupation with fancy light effects and gloomy evocations. The possibility of an afterlife leaves room for fascinating dimensions, and the intricacies of the human soul could have been explored to much greater effect. But in Schumacher's hands, it only emerges as a tripped out light show. Very nice to look at, but not a single shred of human feeling to sharpen the focus.

Most people remember it for the iconic transformation scene. Traditionally, most special effects in movies tend to not date very well. But like Karloff's Frankenstein, or John Carpenter's re-imagining of The Thing, the transformation scene in American Werewolf continues to get better with age. The feats accomplished in this scene (when you look at it from the eyes of the post-CGI world) have never been topped. Even today, you feel David's pain as his body stretches and snaps and morphs into something else.And the film itself is just as iconic. It's such a simple story when you stop to think about it. There's no final twist. No underlined message put in by a director who thinks he's smarter than you. No room for a sequel (although the hacks in Woodtown saw fit to make one anyway in the mid-1990's). The movie hangs on a very basic plot-thread, and for a movie known for it's jaw dropping effects, it's primarily character driven.John Landis wrote the movie when he was 19, and that may have something to do with it. There's a strong sense of empathy that runs through the narrative. Just as the transformation scene makes you feel what David's feeling on a spectacular and dramatic level, the rest of the movie makes you feel David's pain, grief, happiness etc. just as affectively. You really get a sense of what this nineteen year old Yankee's backpacking in Europe is all about. Hell, he could even be you.The film does not get bogged down in trying to explain the supernatural events it chronicles. Sure, you're given basic explanation and a sense that there's something bigger going on, but for the most part the movie says that werewolves exist because werewolves exist. David is a werewolf because he was attacked by one and survived. There is no cure. He needs to kill himself. Nuff said thank you very much. Landis does a great job of planting these events into a real world surrounding. It's like he's saying, here's reality as far as this movie is concerned, and just like in our reality, life sucks. Get over it.I read somewhere that the Suits wanted Landis to change the bleak ending. They were saying ((SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT))Come on John, we've gotten to like this kid, why does he have to die? and Landis just laughed and said Because that's how it ends. You've got to respect a guy who sticks by his vision like that.There's a lot to be said about this movie. I could go on and on about the soundtrack. I could mention the hot sex scene. I could write a term paper on the significance of David's dead best friend Jack, who haunts our hero throughout the course of this movie like Hamlet's wacky neighbor. But I will leave this as my final thought in this review - An American Werewolf in London is a timeless masterpiece made by a man who was at the top of his game. Pure. Simple. To the point.

No room for a sequel (although the hacks in Woodtown saw fit to make one anyway in the mid-1990's). The movie hangs on a very basic plot-thread, and for a movie known for it's jaw dropping effects, it's primarily character driven.John Landis wrote the movie when he was 19, and that may have something to do with it. There's a strong sense of empathy that runs through the narrative. Just as the transformation scene makes you feel what David's feeling on a spectacular and dramatic level, the rest of the movie makes you feel David's pain, grief, happiness etc. just as affectively. You really get a sense of what this nineteen year old Yankee's backpacking in Europe is all about. Hell, he could even be you.The film does not get bogged down in trying to explain the supernatural events it chronicles. Sure, you're given basic explanation and a sense that there's something bigger going on, but for the most part the movie says that werewolves exist because werewolves exist. David is a werewolf because he was attacked by one and survived. There is no cure. He needs to kill himself. Nuff said thank you very much. Landis does a great job of planting these events into a real world surrounding. It's like he's saying, here's reality as far as this movie is concerned, and just like in our reality, life sucks. Get over it.I read somewhere that the Suits wanted Landis to change the bleak ending. They were saying ((SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT))Come on John, we've gotten to like this kid, why does he have to die? and Landis just laughed and said Because that's how it ends. You've got to respect a guy who sticks by his vision like that.There's a lot to be said about this movie. I could go on and on about the soundtrack. I could mention the hot sex scene. I could write a term paper on the significance of David's dead best friend Jack, who haunts our hero throughout the course of this movie like Hamlet's wacky neighbor.

Most people remember it for the iconic transformation scene. Traditionally, most special effects in movies tend to not date very well. But like Karloff's Frankenstein, or John Carpenter's re-imagining of The Thing, the transformation scene in American Werewolf continues to get better with age. The feats accomplished in this scene (when you look at it from the eyes of the post-CGI world) have never been topped. Even today, you feel David's pain as his body stretches and snaps and morphs into something else.And the film itself is just as iconic. It's such a simple story when you stop to think about it.

This entire movie is an nostalgic trip and homage to the charismatic '60's. I mean, if you want to see how life of the American youth in the '60's was like, you should really watch this movie.The movie its story follows a group of friends that spend their last night together in town as high school graduations. After this all their lives will change and they will each head into different directions with their lives. For the last time they do want they want and simply enjoy their youth and the innocence of it. The movie has multiple story lines as it follows multiple individual characters during that one night. Every character experience something different and also learn some important life lessons in the progress. It makes the story well written and developed and all of the characters likable and interesting, although they are very stereotypical. It also of course helps the movie that they are being played by some great actors.The movie features lots of actors that at the time were still very young but now are very 'big'. Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss and Charles Martin Smith but also Harrison Ford in a small but very cool and likable role. A kind of role you wouldn't expect of him now days. Also look out for Kathleen Quinlan and Joe Spano in some small roles. So real great casting in this one! Every actor delivers a very realistic and likable performance.The movie features lots of stereotypical nostalgic '60's elements, such as drive-ins, cruising the strip, drag races etc. The movie is good looking with some nice looking cars and production design. It really helps to set the right mood for the time period the movie is set in. Also of course the very present musical-score consisting entirely out of memorable rock 'n' roll hits of the era helps to give you a real '60's' feeling, even if you weren't even born at that time (such as myself by the way).The movie is a great mix of nostalgic '60's elements and 'coming of age' story lines.
