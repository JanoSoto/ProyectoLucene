[{"date":"2 March 2003","score":"","review":"  I watched this late one night on cable thinking I was going to hate it remembering how godawful BORIS AND NATASHA was (I can't believe some of the other reviewers actually liked  that movie). But I found myself laughing from beginning to end. The puns and the one-liners still have the same sting as the original 60's cartoon series. Alexander, Russo and De Niro all capture Boris, Natasha and Fearless Leader, respectively, just right and the animation never overpowered the live action. I kept forgetting I was watching an animation\/live action combo. I'm actually looking forward to a sequel. Series creator Jay Ward would have been proud of this movie. Highly recommended to fans of the TV series.
