In order to make himself a quick and easy buck he gets a small team of ghosts to scare residents into believing that their homes are haunted. However, when performing an exorcism at one house he discovers a demon that isn't part of the act and Bannister soon discovers that this demon is killing both the living and the dead. Bannister finds himself having to use his psychic abilities for a good cause and with the help of Dr Lucy Lynskey (Trini Alvarado) and his ghost friends he sets out to try and stop the demon.The Frighteners is certainly a film that I fully expected to enjoy - at least that's what I thought after watching the first 5 minutes. It looked like the sort of film that might have been a daft bit of fun, but for me sadly the sense of fun only came in very short bursts.Initially, the story presents itself as merely a slight re-working of Ghost (only presumably a more fun version), but it expands slightly on this concept as the story progresses. I was unsure when watching this film whether it was intended as a satire or as a comedy horror. Whatever it was trying to achieve it mostly failed as it wasn't well-observed enough to work as a satire, nor was it funny enough or scary enough to work as a comedy horror. The script itself generally lacked any sort of wit and I didn't think that the film flowed all that well - it probably didn't help that I also didn't find the story all that involving. I also didn't think Bannister's ghosts were that funny and to be honest I found them irritating more than anything else.The final third of the film was silly, over the top and utterly ridiculous, but to be fair it did seem to at least bring some fun and excitement to the table which seemed to be lacking for the bulk of the film. Adopting this tone throughout the film wouldn't have necessarily made it a particularly good film or even a memorable one, but it would have at least been an enjoyable one.The only positives about this film are the special effects which were great for their time. R Lee Ermey's cameo in this film is brief but it was easily the funniest and most memorable thing about this film. Michael J Fox is pretty good here and does try to bring some energy to the film, but with so much working against him this always seemed like a lost cause. All in all it's a disappointing film considering its credentials.

His Girl Friday is very much a screwball comedy, and that genre in itself is a product of its time. It still holds up 70 some odd years later, but films just aren't made this way anymore. It's a fast talking and dialogue driven film about a man who is willing to do whatever it takes to keep his ex-wife and former reporter from marrying an insurance man.Cary Grant plays Walter Burns, the editor of the Morning Post., while Rosalind Russell plays his ex-wife and reporter Hildegard 'Hildy' Johnson. It's based on a play, but Howard Hawks, the director, made one bold but brilliant move by switching the sex of the Hildy character. I'm not sure how the play was written, but the dynamic between Hildy and Walter creates not only immensely funny moments, but also a relationship you root for in a film. Normally, it's not easy to root for a character who wishes to break up a soon- to-be marriage, but Grant brought a great sense vulnerability that proved to make it easier to feel for his character. It doesn't hurt that Cary Grant is one of the most charismatic actors of all time. What I found most impressive wasn't the acting or the notably funny script, it was the direction of Howard Hawks. I had seen a few of his films in the past including The Big Sleep and one of my favorite films of all time, Bringing up Baby, but it was his direction here that caught my attention the most. It's very difficult to keep an audience's attention without any real action or a ton of physical comedy like his other films, but Hawks uses these dialogue driven scenes in a way that doesn't feel overwhelming, instead, it proved to be very entertaining. I understand that the invention multi- track recording wasn't developed yet, so he told the sound mixing crew to turn the overhead microphones on and off throughout the film to create the final product. It's that dedication and attention to detail that makes Hawks one of the most celebrated filmmakers of all time.As I said before, this film is a product of its time in the way it's made. If you look at the editing for films that come out today, it's smoother and the cuts aren't usually very noticeable. In His Girl Friday, you can tell that the technology wasn't available for them to make each cut appear as seamless as they should be. It doesn't necessarily dampen the film's greatness, it's just a way of telling when it was made. In comparison to other comedies close to its release, such as The Philadelphia Story, another one of Grant's remarriage films, I think His Girl Friday has a much lighter tone. The sub- genre of screwball comedies known as the 'comedy of remarriage' has turned out some great entries like Holiday and Bringing up Baby. The ladder being far more like a Chaplin comedy than this film was in its humor. But His Girl Friday proves to be lighter, wittier, and probably aesthetically more important for its significance historically.The narrative focuses a lot on getting a 'scoop' as most of its main characters are writers of some sort. While newspapers are nowhere near as popular as they were during that time, I think the days of getting 'scoops' have returned. Whether it's breaking the latest in a political race, what the Kardashians have been up to, or dropping the latest scoop on the next superhero movie, the media is still obsessed with being first at something, except now it's on social media. So in a way, that's an argument against that His Girl Friday is a product of its time and more so proof that this film is important and should be taught today.The film is brilliant with its comedic timing. Whether it's the delayed reactions between each of the fast talking characters, or the insane and hectic phone conversations the writers are having throughout the picture, His Girl Friday has plenty of entertainment. You can definitely tell that it's based off of a play through the line delivery and its far-fetched plot, but everything works. It did a lot for films at the time as well. Hawks' big change from the play was the decision to make Hildy a woman. Not many films did something like that, if at all. Even today, you see far too little female roles on screen and His Girl Friday was one of the few films to change the story and add a female because it makes the plot far better.

Many movies seem to struggle with a story they cannot hold onto nor do some movies seem to understand what exactly do they want to present to audiences.In 'Mortal Kombat', the guys behind it took their chance to give us movie that would hold the crown for 'best video game movie' in a long time. This movie achieves an astonishing record of that title arguably.First of all, the movie contains the same premise of its game counterpart. Try not to let 'Enter The Dragon' cross into your mind too much.You have your fighters from Earthrealm fighting against Shang Tsung and his Outworld minions. That takes place on an island.... Shang Tsung's island.... If you really wanted to see Scorpion and Sub-Zero go through their story I'm afraid you have to throw that aside. We instead follow the journey of Liu Kang, Sonya Blade and Johnny Cage in their different motivations in taking part in the tournament. It's not bad as long as the characters are cool. I think they are decent enough as protagonists. As for Raiden(Yes, not Rayden), I really like the kind of persona they embodied for him. It's not my preferred rendition of him. But I accept it.So we have some decent heroes but our villains do happen to be more entertaining. Mr. Tagawa especially embraces his role as Shang Tsung and makes up for a pretty funny villain. Kano on the other hand is another entertaining aspect of the villain household. Goro is faithfully impressive and the filmmakers did their best in bringing Goro to life at the time being. As for Reptile, the CGI is not really good as this is one thing to draw audiences back from the quality. Again I'll touch on the iconic ninjas later.Each fight that takes place has some decent choreography placed into it making it be a little authentic as all those Hong Kong martial arts movies you may have seen. Fans may be disappointed with the lack of gore and fatalities but here's the thing. The movie kind of needs to appeal to a target audience that might consist of teens. I sincerely believe they still tried to give us a bit of brutality in the fights. Look at how Scorpion is finished off or how Sub-Zero finishes that poor guard.Set-wise, it is good to look at. Although I question the inaccuracy in showing off China. It's nice they took in Thailand as their filming location. Gives the movie some visual interest. The acting is passable, it's not great as a whole but it is serviceable. I'll say that this movie still gives MK fans a good movie by diving into the lore of many MK characters. It's a bit cheesy but not to the point of me cringing.Oh yeah in regards to Scorpion and Sub-Zero, while they are cool. Ultimately they have better representations elsewhere. Both are just cannon fodder with only one line to pass them off as rivals. They are also a bit more expensive to do than other characters which is why they aren't used effectively enough.

If it weren't for this movie then don't expect the theme song to be there and if you wonder why Kano is Australian.... Look at this movie as to why. Same with Your soul is mine.... Combining some good references from the original game along with elements of MKII and in addition to its other aspects in filmmaking, 'Mortal Kombat' displays signs that video game movies can be realised. Props to Paul W.S Anderson, this movie is a special credit from him.

I cannot really see why though. I watched the director's cut of this film and it runs for almost 2 hours and 45 minutes. Certainly a case of quantity over quality here. David Bennent was actually a good choice for the main character as his face was truly memorable. However, the solid acting by him and established actors like Adorf, Winkler, Olbrychski and the young Katharina Thalbach was not enough to make up for the flaws that this film has.Occasionall scenes with soldiers or speeches by Hitler and other Nazi officials are not enough to make a film a convincing political\/war movie. And apart from that, the stories were simply really more absurd than interesting. This goes for the main character's mother having several men at the same time or at the depiction of pedophilia later on, which wasn't even shown as something bad here. Maybe the reason is because this film is so strictly against Hitler, his politics and World War II, so pedophilia something bad that even the Nazis despised was not depicted as really evil for that reason here. But the worst aspect was probably the storyline that the boy stopped growing because he decided to do so. Does it make sense that he did not want to be like adults in this world? Maybe. But don't all kids would like to stay young at some point? Why can't they do it? Complete nonsense rally. The inclusion of dwarf people that apparently made the same decision was really the negative highlight for this plot. I am not sure to what extent this film is based on Nobel Prize winner Günter Grass' work and how close Schlöndorff stayed to the original, but in any case I cannot say this was a successful film adaptation. It's not a great family movie, not a great war movie, not a great political thriller and it's also not worth watching for the historic context. Maybe it could be considered fantasy. But if you hear about a fantasy movie about Hitler, you knew you're in for something that is guilty pleasure material at best. This one here is not. It's just bad. Not recommended and certainly one of the worst Foreign Language Film winners in Oscar history. Also they could have kept this easily at around 100 minutes without losing any of the film's value. So many unnecessary scenes. But I guess they wanted to go for bloated here for whatever reason.

Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre-Dame is a bleak, depressing, accusing and above all else dark book. And the Happiest Place on Earth wants to make an animated family movie out of that? Gods in heavens above, that most have turned a few heads.And you know what? They pulled it off. This movie reaches the darkness of the original novel. It goes over themes of lust, hatred born when that lust goes unfulfilled, discrimination, imprisonment, abusive child raising, religious zealotry, the vanity of man and the fact that absolute power corrupts absolutely. And yet you can show it to any little child out there. It's that masterfully crafted. Judge Claude Frollo is one of the best villains Disney has ever done, not because of any great power he possesses or because of his inhumanity, but because he is in fact oh so very human. He's the dark mirror, the other side of the coin. But I don't think little kids find him that scary. It's only when seen through the eyes of an adult when his true nature really sinks in.Furthermore, the rest of the characters are also very good, with Esmeralda, the gypsy princess, being perhaps my absolutely favourite Disney heroine. She's everything. Resourceful, independent, kick ass fighter, soulful, wise and smoking hot. The music is also beautiful and this film contains many of my all-time favourites. Hellfire, God Help the Outcasts, The Bells of Notre Dame, all amazing, powerful, soul-chilling songs.Alas, much like our eponymous bellringer, the movie is very much flawed. Half of the time it's everything I could wish for. It's dark, insightful, willing to explore themes Disney has never touched before. But the other half of the time is spent goofing around with the gargoyles, or shoving the message that people can beautiful on the inside down our throats, watering the message and the tone, almost ruining both of them. And the unfortunate fact is that Quasimodo is not that interesting of a character. I get that he has to be in the movie. He is in the title, and everything. But if I'm completely honest, I'd have much rather seen a film between Esmeralda and Frollo, with Quasimodo and Phoebus as the two main side characters perhaps. The story already revolves largely around the lust Frollo feels for Esmeralda, so why not reinforce the fact by making Esmeralda the main character.Nevertheless, even as it is, it's an amazing movie. One of the best Disney has ever made. It could be better and has some major, fundamental problems. But when it works, when what it's telling reaches and sends chills razing down your spine and makes the shadows in the corner grow larger, it's transformative.

But if I'm completely honest, I'd have much rather seen a film between Esmeralda and Frollo, with Quasimodo and Phoebus as the two main side characters perhaps. The story already revolves largely around the lust Frollo feels for Esmeralda, so why not reinforce the fact by making Esmeralda the main character.Nevertheless, even as it is, it's an amazing movie. One of the best Disney has ever made. It could be better and has some major, fundamental problems. But when it works, when what it's telling reaches and sends chills razing down your spine and makes the shadows in the corner grow larger, it's transformative.

Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre-Dame is a bleak, depressing, accusing and above all else dark book. And the Happiest Place on Earth wants to make an animated family movie out of that? Gods in heavens above, that most have turned a few heads.And you know what? They pulled it off. This movie reaches the darkness of the original novel. It goes over themes of lust, hatred born when that lust goes unfulfilled, discrimination, imprisonment, abusive child raising, religious zealotry, the vanity of man and the fact that absolute power corrupts absolutely. And yet you can show it to any little child out there. It's that masterfully crafted. Judge Claude Frollo is one of the best villains Disney has ever done, not because of any great power he possesses or because of his inhumanity, but because he is in fact oh so very human. He's the dark mirror, the other side of the coin. But I don't think little kids find him that scary. It's only when seen through the eyes of an adult when his true nature really sinks in.Furthermore, the rest of the characters are also very good, with Esmeralda, the gypsy princess, being perhaps my absolutely favourite Disney heroine.

Then there are other sequences which such innovative camera positioning and angles that one is instantly reminded of the Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. Alas, despite its early promise, Snake Eyes fails to sustain the suspense! The movie falls flat in final act with de Palma failing to orchestrate a fitting closure. That said, Snake Eyes offers more than most modern-day thrillers. If de Palma's camera play is not a good enough reason for you to watch a film then you may watch it for Nicolas Cage, who, like was the norm in the 90s, delivers yet another thoroughly engaging performance.

All of those elements make Tales From The Hood a great Horror Anthology and one of the better Horror films of the 1990s.Tales From The Hood tells the story of three Black youths who have come to a funeral home to purchase some drugs from the funeral home's owner Mr. Simms(Clarence Williams III). While at the funeral home Mr. Simms tells the three youths four different tales of Horror about death,revenge and madness.During the early to mid 1990s when Horror films was seen as dead and African-American cinema and Hood\/Urban films were being made saw the release of Tales From The Hood,a fantastic Horror Anthology that is one of my favorite Horror Anthology movies and is one of the better Horror films of the 1990s that has thankfully earned something of a Cult status among Horror fans. Tales From The Hood takes it's inspirations from Movie and TV Anthologies such as The Twilight Zone,EC Horror Comics,Tales From The Crypt,Creepshow(1982)and other Horror Anthologies before it but what sets Tales From The Hood apart is the African-American aspect and how the movie in a thrilling,scary and suspenseful way with bits of dark humor mixes together Supernatural Horror with an urban style and social commentary of a Spike Lee(who executive produced the movie)film talking about real life issues such as Racism,police brutality,child abuse and gang violence which Tales From the Hood stand out from other Horror Anthologies. The tone of the movie has a great balance of being serious and over the top with a dark and twisted sense of Humor that hangs over the movie. Like many Anthologies each tale is different and are unique in their own way. The movie gets off to a great start with the first tale Rogue Cop Revelation,a revenge story about police brutality and murder involving a civil rights leader,a young and naive Black rookie cop and three corrupt racist Cops. It's a simple but effective tale of revenge that give viewers enough intensity and thrills that keep them entertained. The second story Boys Do Get Bruised is about a young quiet boy named Walter who is getting abused by a monster in his home and wants to kill the monster. Boys Do Get Bruised is probably the most clever and imaginative written of the four stories giving a interesting take on a monster story that is like a Twilight Zone episode but dealing with child abuse with multiple twists and turns(you'll see)at the end of the tale. The third story KKK Comeuppance is about a racist former Klu Klux Klan member and southern Senator Duke Metger who's at plantation where slaves were tortured finds himself being stalked by a living voodoo doll that represents a dead slave. KKK Comeuppance is an entertaining mixture of suspense and dark humor but if you have a fear of dolls or puppets you will probably be a little freaked out. The forth and final story is titled Hard-Core Convert about a violent and homicidal gang member named Crazy-K who is in prison and is given a chance at redemption by a doctor named Dr. Cushing by being put through an scientific program that will help him reform. Hardcore Convert is a disturbing account about gang on gang violence and the consequences of ones actions dealing with violence and death. The segment also pays a great homage to the Stanley Kubrick classic A Clockwork Orange with thought-provoking commentary and a powerful message. The scares and suspense in each story will make you jump and keep you on the edge of your seat while keeping you glued to the screen. If there was one flaw with Tales From The Hood is that the stories were too short and I would have loved if each of the stories were longer and better developed. The violence,blood and gore is a little vicious and gruesome at times but goes well with the film. The ending of Tales From The Hood is amazing and will be very scary and surprising for viewers bringing the movie full circle in a powerful way. A great conclusion.The cast is great. Clarence Williams III is excellent and over the top as Mr. Simms,the owner of the funeral home. Joe Torry(Stack),Samuel Monroe Jr.(Bulldog)and De'Aundre Bonds(Ball)are fantastic as gang bangers who meet Mr. Simms. Tom Wright is effective as Martin Moorehouse,a civil rights leader. Anthony Griffith is wonderful as Clarence Smith,a rookie cop. Wings Hauser(Officer Stroum),Michael Masse(Newton)and Duane Whitaker(Billy)are great as corrupt racist cops. Brandon Hammond is great as Walter,a lonely boy. Rusty Cundieff is good as Mr. Garvy,Walter's teacher. Paula Jai Parker does a fine job as Sissy,Walter's Mother. David Alan Grier is intense as Carl,Sissy's boyfriend. Corbin Bernsen is terrific as Duke Metger,a racist senator. Lamont Bentley is fiery as Crazy K,a homicidal gang banger. Rosalind Cash is sensational as Dr. Cushing,a Doctor who wants to help Crazy K. Roger Guenveur Smith(Rhodie)and Art Evans(Eli)give good performances as well.The direction by Rusty Cundieff is great,with Cundieff bringing a nice pace and workmanlike quality to the film while giving the movie and some nice visual touches.

To work up to now (and also to avoid seeing sequels before originals) I started with The Kid, the classic Charlie Chaplin movie. I knew who he was and could tell you what he looked like, but had never seen one of his films. This movie was really well done, for the time it was filmed and the plot they had. The facial expressions of everyone involved were descriptive enough to get the message across, despite it being a silent film. I was especially impressed with the kid, John, and his acting, from the various moods conveyed through his face to his cooking and acting. Little things, such as when he was preparing food and gave a little nod, signaling the food was done to his tastes. The plot is easily understood, even with only a short amount of written dialogue, and should not be intimidating to audiences who are unfamiliar with silent films. A woman wants to drop her child off so he can be properly cared for, and after a huge mix up, ends up being looked after by The Tramp, himself. She goes on to become famous, and upon discovering her son is still alive five years later, tried to get him back. Despite it having a bit of slapstick comedy and being so old, there were parts where I honestly chuckled out loud, and parts where I felt a bit sad. The music adds to the scenes nicely, as well. It is a short movie, coming in under an hour, and is apparently a masterpiece of Chaplin's, so I am going to go ahead and recommend this movie to everyone. You give it 15 minutes, and you are already almost a third of the way through. And if you really do not like it, you never have to see it again, but you will have seen it. I do not regret seeing this film.

To work up to now (and also to avoid seeing sequels before originals) I started with The Kid, the classic Charlie Chaplin movie. I knew who he was and could tell you what he looked like, but had never seen one of his films. This movie was really well done, for the time it was filmed and the plot they had. The facial expressions of everyone involved were descriptive enough to get the message across, despite it being a silent film. I was especially impressed with the kid, John, and his acting, from the various moods conveyed through his face to his cooking and acting.

Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) combines elements of the classic western and modern thriller to create a cult favorite-one John Carpenter's best films.What stands out is the dialogue and subtleties. the violence is kind of realistic in some ways and no one in show is like a superhero. In other wards, no one is really making some unreal shot with a firearm. Napolean Wilson (Darwin Joston) character is outstanding. I agree about outstanding character development in film. I recommend everyone watch this film in the dark. you almost feel like your caught up in the siege with cops and prisoners.A White - Hot Night of Hate! Assault on Precinct 13 is still one of my all time favorite classic action films that is very realistic and very, very scary today. I still enjoy this classic masterpiece from the Brilliant Director John Carpenter! Darwin Joston as Napoleon Wilson kick's ass! He kicks ass all the gang members to dust, he is most beloved heroes today!!! Austin Stoker as Ethan Bishop a modern cop who people does not respect, he is outstanding character of the police force I ever saw. Even the character and the plot of the movie is not realistic It still an action peace of the 70's. During the siege when cops were fighting and police station it always get me scared. I Love the performance and I love the character Napoleon Wilson also I love Leigh and Ethan Bishop. Classic 70's low budget flick from John Carpenter with plenty of shootouts and good action. Most of the film takes place in a single location at the police station but the standoff is very suspenseful and entertaining. It's sort of a modern day western set in the 70's California suburbs. The relatively unknown cast and music work very well.Before he hit the big time with the classic Halloween, writer\/director John Carpenter gave us Assault on Precinct 13 a story about a cop with a war on his hands with an army of street killers and his only ally is a convicted murderer. A Siege happens and all hell breaks loose. A great B-movie classic from the late 70's that still stands up today and even the 2005 remake was done in good taste with a different twist then the original. I am really wondering if Napoleon did got the parole for saving Leigh, Ethan and that poor old man's life. I seriously I love this movie to death. There was even a remake about this movie Assault on Precinct 13 (2005) and it was good but comparing to this. The Original Is so much better.Police ambush and kill several gang members in Los Angeles. Gang members make a pact of blood to strike back at police, and conduct a siege on the police station which is almost abandoned and due to be closed. Staff of the closing precinct and the criminals being held there while in transit must work together to fight off the attacking gang members. That is the main plot about this action horror flick.The most scary vision is the main theme that John Carpenter performed for the film. The thing that's scared me here is the gang Street Thunder, when one of the gang members kills little girl by the ice-cream truck and the father Lawson (Martin West), pursues and kills with a handgun a gang member who cold bloody murdered his daughter and goes to the payphone to call the police a group of gang members are coming out of dark and he starts running in the station scares me so much.In shock, he is unable to communicate to the officers what has happened to him.
