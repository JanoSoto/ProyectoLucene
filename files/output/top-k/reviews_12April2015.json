In loads of places in this movie, like the bit about the rats, about Angel 'not being that big in real life' and not have inhaled, Jo's of course I'm not keeping it, it's disgusting!, Jo's abortion clinic scene, and several others, were gems, but then again, loads of other stretches needed to be weeded out. But please note that I'm not knocking this movie. I am simply saying that the finished product needed some sprucing up. Okay, lots of sprucing up. And damn it, more resolution in the ending.I am of course just raring to have a say about the actressesFirst off, Daryl Hannah. I've noticed criticism by some of the first-page reviewers thrown her way. Stuff like one of them wished she had a script. Hell. With her long legs, and her cat-like abilities, and her soft-spoken ways, Daryl is an absolute treat as Angel. She was made for the part. Can anyone be so agile sixteen years after having first wowed audiences? Daryl Hannah in high heels, bare-legged and mostly undressed, all tearful, in the parking area scenes are just heartbreakingly beautiful! Hey, reviewers, please note that Daryl played the part of this charmingly naive Angel and gave a charmingly naive portrayal. She was so utterly vulnerable in the scene with the policeman. There are people who aren't really equipped to deal with the realities of the mean old world out there, and Daryl played it to perfection.Second, Charlotte Ayanna. The newcomer. Does a wonderfully charming (and intoxicatingly alluring) Jessie. Pretty little body. Brings out all the protective urges. Dreamgirl. How anybody could slap her around...! But of course there are people like that in the world. Charlotte, good work. You should just have been in loads of great movies besides this one. Instead of that full- of-himself Ricky Martin music video.Third, Sheila Kelly as Stormy. She has a presence! Wow, does she ever have a presence! Grabs your attention the moment the camera comes her way. Stormy deserves a movie of her own. I'd have bought the DVD.And then there is Jennifer Tilly. Hard to believe this is the same girl as the sad character in THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS, equally hard to believe that she was that young woman in BOUND. This is a versatile actress, people!I did not find Sandra Oh to be as great as the scores of other reviewers who think the world of her. I do not nearly think that she 'is a truckload of Kleenex all by herself'. The character, yes, the situation, yes, but for the most part, her portrayal fell flat. I would have said that Daryl's Angel was the true truckload of Kleenex.By the way, IMDb, really, 'an unglamorous look at strippers'? Not how I'd have put it. Makes it sound all wrong. Plenty of glamor in this movie, with the girls themselves. It is their doomed lifestyles that present the negative side, but the movie itself is filled with eye candy. Since you won't lure people into the cinema or towards buying the DVD by saying 'an unglamorous look at strippers' let me just point out that there is an a-b-u-n-d-a-n-c-e of fine flesh + lovely, lovely girls + celebrity skin (and a whole lot of sad stuff that makes it really deep!) But there's a lot of Showgirls in this one too! Yay to that!Review brought to you by RavenGlamDVDCollector who thinks its cool that the picture is sensitive enough to be mistaken for a chick flick. But let's do celebrate the beauty of the female of the species. That's why I bought DANCING AT THE BLUE IGUANA. After downloading the trailer on VuClip, because the plot on Wikipedia sounded fraught with totally depressing stuff.I've kept quiet about one thing. Most of the breasts in the movie are surgically enhanced. Not so Daryl Hannah's. Hell, to that Board Post entry about 'wearing out a VHS tape watching Kristin Bauer's scene'... How foolish to salivate over that! How totally off-putting! But, if I could've woken up alongside an Angel lookalike tomorrow morning... Sigh.

Most of the same cast members are back from the original in the same roles accept for Ryan Stiles who reappears again but as another character oddly (I guess we didn't see him properly in the first flick). As for the title...deux is obviously French for the number two, so was this suppose to be a funny alternative to simply having 'part 2'? bit lame.So everything you got with the first movie you get all over again with this...accept this time the belly laughs are much greater and the visual tomfoolery is much better. The plot follows along the lines of 'Rambo III' with the obligatory changes and simplifications here and there, again this is a complete story and not just a collection of jokes or skits tied together. Once again its directed and written by Jim Abrahams so the quality is still on par with his previous offering.The comedy angle in this movie is much more politically satirical in places with a slightly more grown up vibe. The film starts off with a brilliant sequence showing the dastardly Saddam Hussein (the 90's remember) getting ready for bed in his lavish palace. The entire scene is chock full of brilliant little visual gags, childish gags and some genuinely clever comedy, naturally it all ends in a farcical bit of slapstick but its all really well directed. Jerry Haleva who portrays Hussein really hams it up perfectly giving a great little dialog free performance whilst looking quite authentic. I watch today in amazement that they got away with such blasphemy, these days I'm sure there would be some nasty backlash.From that sharp controversial lampooning we move onto the next big sequence involving the introduction of Sheen's character Topper. Topper is now a buffed up Buddhist living in a small Thai village where he fights for the sheer pleasure of manly violence. Here we see a quite ingenious fight sequence littered with many great visual moments such as Topper's candy coated hand wraps, Richard Crenna's pig snout sub with running mustard, a crowd member getting his head kicked off and the fight ref getting his head squashed between the two fighters flying kicks. It sounds horrific at times and lets not beat around the bush there is some heavy Tom & Jerry style violence in here. But as before the effects are so cheap and tacky looking, so utterly ridiculous and hokey, its quite clear no one (including kids) is gonna be upset by anything here, its a complete cartoon once again. That's not to say the effects are purposely hokey everywhere, far from it, there are also some quite lovely little touches dotted throughout the picture. Who can forget the excellent freezing and shattering of Saddam ala 'T2', the enemy soldier splattered across the side of a hut and Saddam getting crushed under the grand piano. Some of the makeup effects are really nicely done too, clearly the budget for this was much beefier than before.What did impress about this movie was how action packed it was, one exciting scene after another. The attack on the enemy camp as the plot reached its climax is probably the most iconic although the riverboat attack sequence was pretty sweet too. Sheen looks pretty darn good all buffed which was surprising really, he actually went to a lot of trouble to actually look ripped just for a stupid spoof. Anyhow this is where Sheen shines as he runs around this enemy camp doing a Schwarzenegger ('Predator' if anything) and gunning down hordes of armed soldiers without getting a scratch. The video game high score text that pops up on screen telling us the body count and what other ultra violent adult movies the movie now equals and consequently tops, is totally inane but admittedly clever. I love how completely bonkers the action sequence gets trying to lampoon classic action set pieces...even to the point where Topper just grabs a handful of loose ammo and throws it at a bunch of enemy soldiers causing them to drop dead in overly theatrical ways. The action sequences in this movie literately lampoon the classic action man flicks to pieces...and it works.Stand out performances again go to Bridges who just gets better as he goes, some of his scenes are fecking hilarious and the way he whips out some of his dialog is monumentally montorific! Richard Crenna has a small part but his send-up of his Rambo character is super sweet, love his prison cage escape scene with Sheen. I've also gotta throw out a kudos to the small role of the Iraqi Captain played by Greg Sierra. I loved his little performances, he looked the part and has some great facial expressions. He's the bad guy who Crenna's character spits at and a huge bucket load of water hits him in the face...brilliant stuff.What I personally loved about this sequel was the fact that its crammed with so many little visual gags, there's lots going on both foreground and background, even more so than the original movie. Not only is there a lot of lampoonery going on its all of high quality, pretty much all of the jokes still hit their target even to this day. From the political jabs to the movie parodies to the out n out dumbass visual gags, like the now infamous bow and chicken firing scene. Even Rowan Atkinson in one of his first major film roles was pretty good.

It's early in the morning when he's decided to pull off this little stunt, and, standing next to his car, he's holding up a huge boom-box over his head blaring Peter Gabriel's In Your Eyes.This is the most iconic and famous scene in Cameron Crowe's Say Anything..., his 1989 debut which he both wrote and directed. This is a movie I've seen in clips over the years but have never actually sat down and watched the whole thing in its entirety. I've read the critical praise (the most significant coming from the late film critic Roger Ebert), Entertainment Weekly naming it the greatest modern romance AND ranking it at #11 on their list of 50 best high school movies, and a Valentine's Day article in The Washington Post from 2006 titled What I Did For Lloyd. Now I've finally sat down and watched the movie and understood where it's all coming from.The 1980s were a wasteland of teen comedies. John Hughes (1950-2009) was behind the best of them (The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles). At the tail end of the decade, came Cameron Crowe and his Say Anything.... This film is much like any teen comedy\/romance to come out at that time (and ever since) and begins as such, with a noble underachiever who falls for an ultra-intelligent, if socially unskilled, beauty who seems way out of his league. The movie also seems to at least partially pre-figure the Seattle grunge era of the early '90s (which was spear-headed by the legendary grunge band Nirvana), but the exact details of this implication are part of another discussion entirely.Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) is the noble underachiever who dares to ask out the beautiful high school valedictorian Diane Court (Ione Skye) the day after their graduation. Lloyd's ambitions are pretty slim, since the only thing he can really see himself doing in the immediate future is Kick-boxing (which at that time was still a relatively new thing). So at least he's honest about his life's aspirations he knows what he wants to do, and he especially knows what he DOESN'T want to do - which does shock some people and makes him the most truthful character in the entire film. But it's an even bigger shock when he decides that he wants to go out with the lovely Diane Court.Diane, on the other hand, has her whole life set out before her. She's worked hard her entire life to work her way up to the top of her high school graduating class. And all that hard work pays off when she learns she's been granted a fellowship to further her studies overseas in England. And she'll be leaving at the end of the summer. And then there's Lloyd, who impulsively asks her out on a date and much to his surprise, she accepts his invitation. They do go out, they enjoy one another's company, they connect, and their feelings of just being friends with potential do gradually deepen into love. While Diane's over-protective father James Court (John Mahoney) seems to like Lloyd, he mostly sees him as a distraction and someone who's going to steer her away from the future she's worked so hard to achieve.We like Lloyd and Diane both, and we want them to be together. But like any good love story, there has to be roadblocks, and these roadblocks hurt...In a major subplot, however, James, owner of an elderly-care facility, is also being investigated by the IRS for tax fraud. This subplot would be a most unnecessary distraction from an otherwise touching teen romance, but the way everything turns out and why it's even happened in the first place is just one of the many unique charms of Say Anything... and why it stands out amongst most teen romance films made before and since. A less ambitious movie would JUST be about Lloyd & Diane's relationship and nothing else, but Say Anything... has other things on its mind beside those two - even though it still hurts us when outside forces cause them to separate for a time. Say Anything... wants to show us how their relationship is affecting everyone around them, and how everyone around them is affecting them, as well.Say Anything... is a wondrously scripted, acted, and directed film; it's definitely an early indication of the skill of a writer and director with huge ideas, huge potential. Crowe knew his characters well and chose his performers even better. John Cusack and Ione Skye are the dynamic young stars playing Lloyd and Diane. Like John Hughes before him and who dominated the early portion of the 1980s teen scene, Cameron Crowe knew how to make a smart teen film one that is not filled with stupid sex jokes and even stupider characters - teens and adults alike.With that in mind, I can see how an audience so cynical in 1989 after being bombarded with teen comedy after teen comedy throughout the earlier portion of the decade can very easily write off Say Anything... as just Another Teen Movie. It's a teen film, yes, and an occasionally very funny one, too, but it's also an extraordinarily moving and compelling one, as well. So I can also see how that cynicism would wear off once the movie really begins to reveal itself to the audience - especially with its emotional honesty and maturity, and the fact that it's actually a very well-written and acted little piece of cinema.So it's really no wonder why you can Say Anything you want about Say Anything... but you cannot deny that it is not a great movie!10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 April 2015","score":"","review":" Most of us know about that scene, that famous scene where the guy is standing in the front yard outside the house of his girlfriend (or ex-girlfriend, I should say), after she just broke up with him the day before.

Raiders of the Lost Ark, on the other hand, has quite a few mistakes that are just hard for me to ignore.I mean, really...wouldn't the Nazis have to believe in the Tanakh in order to believe that the Ark of the Covenant will give them the power to take over the world? And if they did believe in the Tanakh, which says that Jewish people are God's chosen people, then why would they be sending them to concentration camps and gas chambers?

Even to people who have never really seen the film (like me), still refer to that action as matrix.I actually really like this film, I don't know if I love it, but I definitely will watch the sequels and probably even need to watch this one again soon. The reason being that I did not totally understand what was going on in respect to the transition between worlds, until my friend clarified it for me and it made so much more sense after. However, I didn't realize I hadn't understood until I talked about it, as the film really engages you with its actions, effects, dialogue - basically everything. There is so much going on in the film at one time, that even if you do not fully understand what is happening, you are invested in that moment there and then.The acting was good too, though the speech did feel a little dry at times. Hugo Weaving portrays the villain character very well and his expressions speak volumes. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss are also very badass in this, I like it! Though I do have to comment on the fact that Trinity is the only prominent female character in this and she is reduced to emotion, once again promoting the male = active, female = passive, binaries.Speaking of badass, the action scenes were really on point. It was very fast-paced and has that glitch feel to it which emphasizes the concept of the world. It does feel odd sometimes and I know this is part of the concept, but I really hate (can't stand it ever) when there is flying involved in fights. I just cannot deal.The effects were phenomenal, and seems really progressive of its time. I mean this was before the turn of the century, and yet we are still getting movies with not so great visual effects today.Also, it is great how the film covers almost all aspects of life action, romance, friendships, violence, society, digital age and whatnot. I've read reviews that attribute philosophical and religious meanings to this, but I personally prefer not to go along those lines. A really great film, and I can't help but wonder if Inception was influenced by this. The Wachowski Brothers really have a trademark in the stories they tell; I was not surprised when I found out they directed Cloud Atlas as well, it has a similar style to The Matrix.

The Sword in the Stone, based on T.H. White's novel, centers on King Arthur's (Sorenson) beginnings as a scrawny young boy, nicknamed Wart, working in his family's kitchen and learning from the wise and amusing wizard Merlin how to achieve greatness in life. Disney thought the pitch for this movie was s*it when he saw it, and he was almost right. Writer Bill Peet decided to be as incredibly faithful to the novel as possible, covering the basics like Arthur's dismal status as a servant and Merlin's tutoring through animal transformations, but filling the gaps with repetitive slapstick humor that lacks any real thought or contribution to the already thin narrative. This could've easily been condensed into a 30-minute short film, but we're expected to watch some monotonous animal chases, a clever yet tedious wizard war, and some out-of-place points of drama. Why out-of-place? Because the film doesn't set up to have us care about Arthur any more than the cute female squirrel that chases him, even in the two times he breaks into tears. It's not an absolute catastrophe, however; at least one of the Sherman-written songs, That's What Makes the World Go Round, is catchy, the animation is adequate, although it lacks the depth & beauty of previous Disney efforts, including Beauty. Sadly, Disney was obviously in its own Dark Ages, because this film is as dull as the time period it's based on. It should've been put straight back onto the drawing board.

Sean Connery returns once again as Agent 007 and takes his first big case against SPECTRE, a secret crime organization. Two Russian SPECTRE operatives are assigned to retrieve a decoding device known as the Lektor using Soviet Embassy clerk Tatiana Romanova (Bianchi) to secretly lure Bond into retrieving the device and passing it over to them. For Bond, getting to and protecting such device sparks a long line of deadly brawls and gunfights that once again test his wit with fancy new gadgets at hand. Just a year after Dr. No was made, Connery hasn't lost any of the essential charisma and vigor to perfectly carry on this role as the first James Bond. This time around, he is a given a much more sophisticated story to have fun with, as well as an alluring young lady played marvelously by Bianchi. Having station chief Ali Kerim Bey (Armendariz) as a sidekick for Bond adds the right amount of clever, humorous banter that this franchise needs. The pace isn't as brisk and straightforward as the first film, due to the film's comparable complexity, but when the action hits, it hits hard, especially in the second half when a fight between gypsies and gunmen ensues, SPECTRE agent Grant (Shaw) goes cameo, and when a claustrophobic train-car fight occurs. Kudos to Mr. Young and cameraman Ted Moore for avoiding the choppy editing and constant close-ups that would've robbed these superb scenes of any of their tension. Next to its slight unevenness, my only little problem with the film is Lotte Lenya's exceedingly over-the-top performance as a SPECTRE officer. All in all, Bond's second go-around takes what the first film set and expands it for one of the most engaging experiences in the franchise. From MovieScope with Love.

Two Russian SPECTRE operatives are assigned to retrieve a decoding device known as the Lektor using Soviet Embassy clerk Tatiana Romanova (Bianchi) to secretly lure Bond into retrieving the device and passing it over to them. For Bond, getting to and protecting such device sparks a long line of deadly brawls and gunfights that once again test his wit with fancy new gadgets at hand. Just a year after Dr. No was made, Connery hasn't lost any of the essential charisma and vigor to perfectly carry on this role as the first James Bond. This time around, he is a given a much more sophisticated story to have fun with, as well as an alluring young lady played marvelously by Bianchi. Having station chief Ali Kerim Bey (Armendariz) as a sidekick for Bond adds the right amount of clever, humorous banter that this franchise needs. The pace isn't as brisk and straightforward as the first film, due to the film's comparable complexity, but when the action hits, it hits hard, especially in the second half when a fight between gypsies and gunmen ensues, SPECTRE agent Grant (Shaw) goes cameo, and when a claustrophobic train-car fight occurs. Kudos to Mr. Young and cameraman Ted Moore for avoiding the choppy editing and constant close-ups that would've robbed these superb scenes of any of their tension. Next to its slight unevenness, my only little problem with the film is Lotte Lenya's exceedingly over-the-top performance as a SPECTRE officer. All in all, Bond's second go-around takes what the first film set and expands it for one of the most engaging experiences in the franchise. From MovieScope with Love.

Corey Haim has always been a better nerd struggling to get the hot girl's attention. There is something lost when he starts off with the hot girl. The special effects are pretty tame and a bit lame. The bloody violence looks cheesy with the creature mostly off screen. Again it's not the worst but the film doesn't have the skills to make lemonade out of lemons. There are no Steven Spielberg and John Williams when the shark isn't working. It is fascinating to see a young Jason Priestley. With Lem hiding Tracey, it seems obvious that Travis should contact the doctors or the cops. There are massacres but these two NSO agents continue to dominate. Even if the movie forces the conspiracy to continue, the whole area should be saturated with cops or military or both. The final twist isn't much of a surprise and comes off again rather cheesy.

Both have been cheated out of hard-earned wages by a fraudulent employer, and when they corner him in a bar, they beat him so savagely that it seems pointless to hang around town. When they take lodging in a 50-centavo common room-style hotel, the seasoned, wisecracking Howard (Walter Huston) talks about treasure in the mountains as a way to make a sizable profit. The three down-and-out gold prospectors, hitherto slumming in Tampico, venture into the eponymous mountain range and strike the mother lode. But soon, trouble starts brewing as Dobbs finds his altruistic view of wealth transformed, grows avaricious and becomes completely conquered by his murderous suspicions towards the other two men, till everything they've worked for and accumulated is jeopardized.The simple tale of the Freudian triangle (that ultimately endures 10 months of hardship at the hands of mother nature and, to varying extents, each other) in the Mexican desert seems lifted straight out of archetypal myths, with the tragic Dobbs functioning as the moral lynch-pin - ultimately unlikable but achingly human in his weaknesses. Huston's crackerjack screenplay is a study in karmic justice; tragic in its portrayal of the inevitable crumbling of one's conscience in the face of fortune. Shot largely on location, the film posits its characters against the unforgiving immensity of their surroundings (sun-blasted high chaparral landscape, usually desolate, except for the three central characters), rendering their efforts almost pathetically sublime. Decades since its release, the performances by the three leads continue to exert a raw moral power. Bogart goes full-tilt in a bold, unapologetic turn as the unhinged Dobbs. He exhibits a brilliant level of nuance as he changes from a bum down on his luck to a man filled with paranoia and lust for money. Holt makes a sturdy counterweight to Dobbs' excesses. But it is Huston Sr. who holds his own as the wise old buzzard, flanking Bogart's bravura paranoia. He may have a bit of a wacky side, but that facade belies a capable and wise core. He infuses his character with such energy and charisma that he forces everyone into the background whenever he's on screen.The Treasure of Sierra Madre is a clever study of the essential existential hopelessness and loneliness of the avaricious man. Partly realistic, partly poetic, fully moral, this deservingly canonized behemoth is one of the relatively few films that transcend the medium to become a mandatory viewing experience for anyone that identifies themselves as a human being, period.

It's the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn't (or, at least, shouldn't) pay.It still doesn't, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family aren't limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in.Yet The Godfather is not quite that simple. It was Mr. Puzo's point, which has been made somehow more ambiguous and more interesting in the film, that the experience of the Corleone Family, as particular as it is, may be the mid-twentieth-century equivalent of the oil and lumber and railroad barons of nineteenth-century America. In the course of the ten years of intra-Mafia gang wars (1945-1955) dramatized by the film, the Corleones are, in fact, inching toward social and financial respectability.For the Corleones, the land of opportunity is America the Ugly, in which almost everyone who is not Sicilian or, more narrowly, not a Corleone, is a potential enemy. Mr. Coppola captures this feeling of remoteness through the physical look of place and period, and through the narrative's point of view. The Godfather seems to take place entirely inside a huge, smoky, plastic dome, through which the Corleones see our real world only dimly.Thus, at the crucial meeting of Mafia families, when the decision is made to take over the hard drug market, one old don argues in favor, saying he would keep the trade confined to blacks&#x97;they are animals anyway.This is all the more terrifying because, within their isolation, there is such a sense of love and honor, no matter how bizarre.The film is affecting for many reasons, including the return of Marlon Brando, who has been away only in spirit, as Don Vito Corleone, the magnificent, shrewd old Corleone patriarch. It's not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due.Some, however, must be cited, especially Al Pacino, as the college- educated son who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have Brando as his father; as well as James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, Al Martino, and Morgana King. Mr. Coppola has not denied the characters' Italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre.The Godfather plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of life&#x97;marriages, baptisms, family feasts&#x97;become an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun, and booby-trapped automobile. The film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban Tudor palace where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get underfoot. It is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth.

It's the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn't (or, at least, shouldn't) pay.It still doesn't, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family aren't limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in.Yet The Godfather is not quite that simple. It was Mr. Puzo's point, which has been made somehow more ambiguous and more interesting in the film, that the experience of the Corleone Family, as particular as it is, may be the mid-twentieth-century equivalent of the oil and lumber and railroad barons of nineteenth-century America. In the course of the ten years of intra-Mafia gang wars (1945-1955) dramatized by the film, the Corleones are, in fact, inching toward social and financial respectability.For the Corleones, the land of opportunity is America the Ugly, in which almost everyone who is not Sicilian or, more narrowly, not a Corleone, is a potential enemy. Mr. Coppola captures this feeling of remoteness through the physical look of place and period, and through the narrative's point of view. The Godfather seems to take place entirely inside a huge, smoky, plastic dome, through which the Corleones see our real world only dimly.Thus, at the crucial meeting of Mafia families, when the decision is made to take over the hard drug market, one old don argues in favor, saying he would keep the trade confined to blacks&#x97;they are animals anyway.This is all the more terrifying because, within their isolation, there is such a sense of love and honor, no matter how bizarre.The film is affecting for many reasons, including the return of Marlon Brando, who has been away only in spirit, as Don Vito Corleone, the magnificent, shrewd old Corleone patriarch. It's not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due.Some, however, must be cited, especially Al Pacino, as the college- educated son who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have Brando as his father; as well as James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, Al Martino, and Morgana King. Mr. Coppola has not denied the characters' Italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre.The Godfather plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of life&#x97;marriages, baptisms, family feasts&#x97;become an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun, and booby-trapped automobile. The film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban Tudor palace where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get underfoot. It is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth. It's nothing personal, just their way of doing business as usual.
