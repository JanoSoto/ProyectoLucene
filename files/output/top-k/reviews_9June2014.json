It also becomes frustrating to give explanations to how it can be reversed. This movie isn't the first one to focus on dead characters but it's intriguing to watch it. As stated in my summary, this film plays out like an early version of what R.I.P.D. (2013) could've been - its plot runs parallel to it. And if you account for the other elements such as the deformed dead villains reeking havoc and it's up to two cops to take them down. It's hard not to see the similarities. The sad thing is, this movie could've been just as good as R.I.P.D. (2013) if they had developed the writing more. It was mighty close though because it has an abundance of good points.Again the story focuses on two smart-aleck cops, Roger (Treat Williams) & Doug (Joe Piscopo) who end up fighting the weird side of crime. The problems are ushered in by thugs that just don't seem to die. Even worse is that every time they come back, they look more grotesque than before. Here, Treat Williams and Joe Piscopo demonstrate comical chemistry and how to have fun with such a ridiculous concept. Although Piscopo essentially is the definition of the 1980s with his sense of style and the way he spouts out cheesy comments, he's still a strong highlight. Meanwhile, Treat Williams plays opposite of that; cool, calm and collected. That is until later on in the film where he goes rather bonkers, which is also comical. The background to their characters' history isn't gone into with depth but it's a change to see two wisecracking cops getting along even with their odd differences from the beginning. Instead of going the usual route of having them bash heads before they come to a resolution.To most, the rest of the cast isn't much worth to remember but there are some attractive and recognizable faces. Actresses Lindsay Frost and Clare Kirkconnell play cute women, both of which demonstrate decent acting. Then there's a brief scene with Robert Picardo being the Lieutenant of the Police (with a mustache). The veteran actors that older viewers should recognize are Keye Luke as a Chinese restaurant owner, Darren McGavin as a head doctor and the famous late Vincent Price who plays an important plot point in the movie. All of which these actors have scenes that are enjoyable to watch. Surprisingly, all these scenes were constructed by first time writer Terry Black, who didn't do too badly of a job. Though there are some parts though that don't work.Unfortunately, even though Black's scripts for the main characters were comical, the logic behind various pieces to the film's structure are left unexplained. For example, how is that once someone dies, they were able to figure out they had 12 hours to live after reanimation? Also, some other characters' backgrounds after they were reanimated seemed longer than 12 hours. If so, how is it that they lived longer? Speaking of which, there was a subplot involving the possibility of extending the reanimation process, but is quickly shot down. Strangely enough, a character ends up extending his reanimation time and it's never explained how it would help resolve the main characters' problem. Which leads to the scripts final issue - neglect for its characters.I've never seen a script so wonderfully build up its main characters' personalities through the first two thirds of its running time and then completely neglect them by the final third. By neglect, I mean total disregard to giving a sense of resolution to the issues at hand or what has already happened. That's not to say the ending isn't comical, action packed or even ends on a good note. It just seems to forget what the whole purpose of the story was and therefore finish without a complete sense of closure. Then again, maybe it wasn't intended on having one but it felt like there could've been. The only other complaint viewers may have is with Ernest Troost's style of film music. I say this for two reasons. The first is that, it does appropriately represent the scenes that are portrayed on screen, but they sound like that of William Loose's music from Night of the Living Dead (1968). It sounds old with a tad of 80s synth but not a lot. The second reason why viewers may be disappointed with Troost's music is if you watch the trailer to this movie. The music there sounds way more fun, memorable and somewhat more appropriate to the tone of the film. I only wished he used that theme. However, there are a couple more good things that haven't been mentioned yet. The film is directed by Mark Goldblatt, also known for directing his forgotten only other film a year later, The Punisher (1989). Although his skill is more in editing, the direction is competently done. The other component that is done with expertise is by make-up effects designer\/creator Steve Johnson's work. The gore and practical effects that are mixed in with these premature R.I.P.D. (2013) deado creatures looks fantastic. The look of them are not something you see everyday. In total, its still filled with cheese and plot holes but its mighty tasty.Its weak points are in its writing and music, but they aren't strong enough to overpower the whole film. Thankfully, this buddy cop horror movie has enough charm, gore and unique practical effects to be a delight anyway.

I like the fact there isn't really a main villain,the sheriffs don't act like villains there more like bullies to Rambo,i like that,it brings something new to action movies. The acting is great, the cast do there jobs very well. The action scenes are not shaky cam, it keeps the camera still,even though not a whole a lot of action but, when there is good. The soundtrack is really good, done by the late Jerry Goldsmith. The ending is great, It's emotional and it's pretty rare to see an action hero break into tears.

I had read about the upcoming Superman movie for over a year and I was worried that the film makers would either make a mockery of the source material or just mess it up in some way. My fears were quickly put to rest on that December evening in '78. I was so hoping that it would be a quality film and not some Hanna-Barbera styled cheese-fest. I sat through the brilliant opening on Krypton and was immediately impressed. Clark's back-story more than held my interest. His first day at the Daily Planet introduced some terrific characters, and then it happened... Lois' helicopter accident and Clark's first transformation into Superman. The tagline was You'll believe a man can fly, and I did. I was captivated.From that point on, Superman was an action-filled good time. I left the theater that night with a huge smile on my face. I could not believe what a wonderful job Donner had done on the movie and what a PERFECT Superman that Christopher Reeve was. He was the total embodiment of the character. He played Clark Kent perfectly as well. All of the actors were perfect for their roles. Margot Kidder played Lois Lane so perfectly and so believably.

Nevertheless, it took an undeserved beating from critics, and the praises from admirers were drown out by cries of derision from detractors. Then a surprising thing happened it became a cult-phenomenon. Fans congregated on websites, exchanged experiences and learned that they were not alone in their admiration, while behind-the-scenes footage showed the intention of the filmmakers, deleted material, and sometimes a glimpse of what could have been.'Hollow', 'boring', 'overly depending on special effects' and 'not scary' were some of the complaints heard on the initial release. Well, 'not scary' is something I didn't believe from the start. I vividly remember the first time I saw the scene where Sam Neill plays the last audio recording from the lost ship; that's where my brother and I turned the lights in the room back on. I have never been able to finish it with lights out since. The idea that a ship returns with a presence that can turn even the most rational person into a ravingly aggressive, mutilating psycho scares me beyond anything that I can imagine. A glimpse of the potential beast inside us as the ultimate scare. Although I am not an overly religious person, the notion that something resembling 'Hell' is somewhere within physical reach, is more than I want to contemplate. Monsters in movies are only men in suits, but a suggestion is hard to shake off. With such a solid-gold premise, EH is one of the scariest movies of all time to me. However, it is not necessarily one of my BEST scary movies ever.Paul W. Anderson made a lot of not-too-memorable movies, but this one guarantees him some cult-status (perhaps because he didn't write it?). It is to the credit of the makers of this 'Shining in space' that it is not completely obvious which characters are going to die, which may have been the idea behind the wise casting of not-too-familiar character actors. The script is greatly helped by sturdy performances from Lawrence Fishburn as the plagued but determined captain, and Sam Neill, whose turn into the bad guy in the second half is both surprising and believable. The ships' interiors designs and props seemed a bit clunky and unrealistic to me at first, but the future isn't necessarily Star Trek perfect; EH shows us a state-of-the-art ship still very much limited by human imperfections. By giving the ship the look and feel of a church, the connection with Hell as a place where the sinners are to be judged is aptly made, showing that the makers tried to put in a subtext beyond the ordinary slasher movie. Cinematographer Adrian Biddle uses sweeping camera shots to capture the dark beauty, but knows to keep it steady during the action scenes. Usually, horror works best off-screen, but some of the shock effects, ranging from empty eye sockets to a horribly twisted sado-masochistic home video, are the stuff nightmares are made of, and deserve to be shown in full g(l)ory. The nerve-wrecking sound design makes these scenes perfectly timed heart-pounding moments. But the biggest impact comes from the 'Visions from Hell', which show glimpses of some of the most gruesome images of mangling and torture ever committed to film outside of a snuff movie. Of course, I couldn't resist going through those scenes frame by frame. I really shouldn't have. If Hell exists, I have a pretty good idea now of what it looks like.EH has plenty of sick and twisted greatness, but it also has its flaws. Some of the (computer-generated) special effects look unfinished. Extensive documentaries showed that due to a looming release date, the movie had a unfortunately rushed production and editing phase. Negative test screenings necessitated additional revisions, leaving no time for fine-tuning. Sadly, this has become the way movie blockbusters are made these days, and often it shows the first act of the movie adequately builds up tension and anticipation, the second act delivers quite well with all the increasing shocks and terror, but the third act is unnecessarily rushed and predictable. The straightforward climax is mostly to blame, as many of the genre-conventions take over the guilt-stricken hero making his final sacrifice, the bad guy returning for the final showdown, and a big explosion to wrap things up. Many opportunities for important character moments were missed. While some of the crew's torments take center stage, it would have helped greatly to see how the other are affected; their characters would have gotten involved in the story much more than is the case now. Sean Pertwee gets away with some of the best moments as the character who instinctively knew they should not have gone there in the first place, but Joely Richardson deserved a more active part in the narrative, while Richard T. Jones' comic relief feels a bit forced. EH is nowadays praised as quite daring, and influential in both movies (torture-porn?) and games. Although it may not be a masterpiece, this movie has had its long-lasting effects on me. Art isn't necessary beautiful or in good taste, and if quality can be measured in how something moves us, then EH certainly has some. Every time I watch it, I cannot help being drawn to those scenes that truly disturb me, like a ship out of Hell that is beckoning me to surrender to Evil. Every time I have seen it, I lose at least an hour of sleep over it. God knows why we mortals keep putting ourselves through this kind of mental auto-mutilation. Damn this movie!!

Fans congregated on websites, exchanged experiences and learned that they were not alone in their admiration, while behind-the-scenes footage showed the intention of the filmmakers, deleted material, and sometimes a glimpse of what could have been.'Hollow', 'boring', 'overly depending on special effects' and 'not scary' were some of the complaints heard on the initial release. Well, 'not scary' is something I didn't believe from the start. I vividly remember the first time I saw the scene where Sam Neill plays the last audio recording from the lost ship; that's where my brother and I turned the lights in the room back on. I have never been able to finish it with lights out since. The idea that a ship returns with a presence that can turn even the most rational person into a ravingly aggressive, mutilating psycho scares me beyond anything that I can imagine. A glimpse of the potential beast inside us as the ultimate scare. Although I am not an overly religious person, the notion that something resembling 'Hell' is somewhere within physical reach, is more than I want to contemplate. Monsters in movies are only men in suits, but a suggestion is hard to shake off. With such a solid-gold premise, EH is one of the scariest movies of all time to me. However, it is not necessarily one of my BEST scary movies ever.Paul W. Anderson made a lot of not-too-memorable movies, but this one guarantees him some cult-status (perhaps because he didn't write it?). It is to the credit of the makers of this 'Shining in space' that it is not completely obvious which characters are going to die, which may have been the idea behind the wise casting of not-too-familiar character actors. The script is greatly helped by sturdy performances from Lawrence Fishburn as the plagued but determined captain, and Sam Neill, whose turn into the bad guy in the second half is both surprising and believable. The ships' interiors designs and props seemed a bit clunky and unrealistic to me at first, but the future isn't necessarily Star Trek perfect; EH shows us a state-of-the-art ship still very much limited by human imperfections. By giving the ship the look and feel of a church, the connection with Hell as a place where the sinners are to be judged is aptly made, showing that the makers tried to put in a subtext beyond the ordinary slasher movie. Cinematographer Adrian Biddle uses sweeping camera shots to capture the dark beauty, but knows to keep it steady during the action scenes. Usually, horror works best off-screen, but some of the shock effects, ranging from empty eye sockets to a horribly twisted sado-masochistic home video, are the stuff nightmares are made of, and deserve to be shown in full g(l)ory. The nerve-wrecking sound design makes these scenes perfectly timed heart-pounding moments. But the biggest impact comes from the 'Visions from Hell', which show glimpses of some of the most gruesome images of mangling and torture ever committed to film outside of a snuff movie. Of course, I couldn't resist going through those scenes frame by frame. I really shouldn't have. If Hell exists, I have a pretty good idea now of what it looks like.EH has plenty of sick and twisted greatness, but it also has its flaws. Some of the (computer-generated) special effects look unfinished. Extensive documentaries showed that due to a looming release date, the movie had a unfortunately rushed production and editing phase. Negative test screenings necessitated additional revisions, leaving no time for fine-tuning. Sadly, this has become the way movie blockbusters are made these days, and often it shows the first act of the movie adequately builds up tension and anticipation, the second act delivers quite well with all the increasing shocks and terror, but the third act is unnecessarily rushed and predictable. The straightforward climax is mostly to blame, as many of the genre-conventions take over the guilt-stricken hero making his final sacrifice, the bad guy returning for the final showdown, and a big explosion to wrap things up. Many opportunities for important character moments were missed. While some of the crew's torments take center stage, it would have helped greatly to see how the other are affected; their characters would have gotten involved in the story much more than is the case now. Sean Pertwee gets away with some of the best moments as the character who instinctively knew they should not have gone there in the first place, but Joely Richardson deserved a more active part in the narrative, while Richard T. Jones' comic relief feels a bit forced. EH is nowadays praised as quite daring, and influential in both movies (torture-porn?) and games. Although it may not be a masterpiece, this movie has had its long-lasting effects on me. Art isn't necessary beautiful or in good taste, and if quality can be measured in how something moves us, then EH certainly has some. Every time I watch it, I cannot help being drawn to those scenes that truly disturb me, like a ship out of Hell that is beckoning me to surrender to Evil. Every time I have seen it, I lose at least an hour of sleep over it. God knows why we mortals keep putting ourselves through this kind of mental auto-mutilation. Damn this movie!!

The light representing the good and peace of mankind and the black revealing the darkest of shadows and the true tone of eclipsed mystery. The world's that are already bleak, suddenly takes a turn when the movie is done in a German Expressionistic style.Believe it or not, if you've seen any Tim Burton film (Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Frankenweenie, etc&#x85;) then you have an idea what German Expressionism is about; looking at the ideas of madness and insanity in a more visual style.

Speaking of Germany, this country has given the world a lot of interesting stories from the dystopian future of Metropolis to the eerie tone of Cabinet of Doctor Caligari. But I'm here today to examine it's view on vampires in Nosferatu.This is actually an interesting retelling of Dracula. Apparently, the studio could not obtain the rights to produce the Bram Stocker novel, so they took the same formula, and changed the names in an attempt to make it their own.It opens with lawyer Thomas Hutter who is being sent to Transylvania to visit a new client named Count Orlok. He bids farewell to his fiancé Ellen and entrusts his friends Harding, and Harding's sister Annie to look after her. Close to his destination, he comes to an Inn where he is warned by villagers to not go to the Orlok's castle at night.He arrives to find Count Orlok (played by Max Schreck) to be a thin, almost terrifying man to look at. He continues his assignment, aside from the strange occurrences from puncture marks on his neck to Orlok almost sucking the blood from his thumb. Orlok signs the documents to buy the house across from Hutter as the lawyer starts to suspect that Orlok may be Nosferatu, The Bird of Death. Hutter escapes, but Nosferatu ends up shipping his body out in the seas where he continues to attack each sailor one by one. He eventually reaches Hutter's town, as the young man must race to save his fiancé.If a silent movie should be watched around Halloween, then Nosferatu is the best answer. Though not as recognized as the Bela Lugosi Dracula, this vampire story is just as atmospheric and a tad creepier. The German Expressionistic tone only makes the scenario scarier and Max Schreck becomes one with the matching scenery as the chilling Count Orlok. I remember watching this for the first time when I was a freshman in college, and this gave me fighting dreams for two days.

But I will say that these images are the ones that inspired men like Tim Burton to continue to show new light on this kind of expressionism. It's played in many film classes for a good reason; it's the grandfather of horror. Nosferatu probably won't sway modern movie goers, but this is a must for any fan of horror or Tim Burton.I'll give this ten shadows of Count Orlok out of ten.

The German Expressionistic tone only makes the scenario scarier and Max Schreck becomes one with the matching scenery as the chilling Count Orlok. I remember watching this for the first time when I was a freshman in college, and this gave me fighting dreams for two days. I can still see that demonic creature whenever I close my eyes.As silent movies go, this is one of the best ones (certainly best of the horror silent). I have yet to see the Lon Chaney Phantom of the Opera or Hunchback of Notre Dame, so I can't make too much of a comparison. But I will say that these images are the ones that inspired men like Tim Burton to continue to show new light on this kind of expressionism. It's played in many film classes for a good reason; it's the grandfather of horror. Nosferatu probably won't sway modern movie goers, but this is a must for any fan of horror or Tim Burton.I'll give this ten shadows of Count Orlok out of ten. As dark as the castle that it sits in, Nosferatu is a bleak, but beautifully crafted tale of Dracula is in the National Film Registry for a reason. See why this old film is worth preserving.

This film, however, will leave you speechless because of three aspects confined feeling, improbable MacGuffin and excellent trio of leading stars. Consequently, the movie appears to be skating on pretty thin ice likewise the leading character who too earnestly plans but too easily slips up...The setting of this movie is no great spectacular location, like it would be the case of NORTH BY NORTHWEST or VERTIGO; it does not reach a loud crescendo like in A MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, it is no psychological drama in the mode of PSYCHO or SPELLBOUND nor does it reveal any Hitch's haunting effects like THE BIRDS or REBECCA. DIAL M FOR MURDER, the first movie made in 3D technology (paradoxically, released in the format after Hitchcock's death) with the screenplay by Frederick Knott, can boast of something on its own striking use of colors, innovative experiments with visuals as well as almost claustrophobic settings that results in a rather confined feeling. The camera-work beautifully corresponds to the perceptions of viewers who are, in a way, involved in the world of the characters. Sometimes, the camera positions itself in such a way that even our perceptions resist the supreme spell of suspense. Consider the image from the top when the murder is being planned. We see the flat suddenly, in a different way, more from the watcher's point of view. For every little step is measured, every movement planned. Yes, we cannot escape being there, feeling the mood of the growing action and awe inspiring magnetism of single details.The movie's MacGuffin (famous Hitchcock's concept) revolves around the key that requires particular attention absorbing a viewer entirely. Here, as nowhere else, the director's precision and considerable commitment is remarkable. Mainstay thematic concerns, like suspense, wit, obsessive desires, neatly-planned murder are present here along with the director's cameo presence that does not make us wait forever. While tension grows, mistrust appears to place seeds of doubt about the motives. Objects like notes, a latchkey, gloves, watch and telephone create this tension remarkably. Unlike some other films, we know what happens, we seem to know the motives, nothing truly might appear as 'unpredictable' and yet, the viewer's attention is kept throughout in truly impressive tension. You cannot simply allow yourself for skipping even the slightest detail though you know who the villain is and you know that the villain is doomed to be punished (for unlike in real life, movies of the time had to punish the baddies). But this is achieved primarily thanks to wonderful performances.Although there are many supporting cast who do wonderful jobs and also contribute considerably to the magic of the entire movie, the trio of Grace Kelly, Robert Cunnings and Ray Milland is unforgettable. One of the three films that resulted from Grace Kelly\/Hitchcock's great rapport sheds light on some new aspects of this beautiful, talented, highly sophisticated woman that embodied Hitchcock's ideal of beauty. She is captivating as Margot, a woman torn apart between two men, whose feelings are constantly changing, a woman whose relationship with her husband appears to be on pretty thin ice, whose illusion turns into disillusion and trust into mistrust. The entire emotional scheme of the movie is placed in her and delivered perfectly. Ray Milland is another milestone performance of a man who is exact, precise, stylish, decisive, extremely controlled and yet, not thoroughly. Something must break him at last...Robert Cunnings is a typical Hitchcock's positive character who is though very lucky to merely witness all that is going on.Among the supporting cast, particular attention should be paid to Anthony Dawson as Captain Lesgate, a reflective, rather sympathetic character subverted to a murderous scheme and punished most. John Wyman also does a fine job as police officer Hubbard.

Scarface is a movie that put its Oliver Stone penned middle finger up to those that shunned excess and made it it's cornerstone that has now seen it become not only a movie marvel but a member of pop culture that many movies only dream to be a part of.A remake of the 1932 Howard Hawkes directed film of the same name, De Palma's updated tale was upon release misunderstood by both audiences and critics alike. People knew not how to take a film that revelled in 3 hours of epic debauchery, murder, vanity and drugs and a main character that only trusts himself and only has his balls and his words, and he doesn't break either of them. It's not hard to see why so many were put off by Al Pacino's frank and stunning turn as an immigrant who can think of nothing more than taking the world any way he can and taking no prisoners in doing so. It's interesting watching such a character at work in today's movie age in which all hero's and antiheroes must have a backbone as to why they do as they do, whereas Tony Montana just wants, he doesn't need a reason to own a tiger or rake in millions he just does it and enjoys doing so. It's a real testament to both the performance of Al Pacino and the script by Stone that this journey and man work the way they do as it would have been an easy feat for the movie to go off the rails without them at full strength which is the same as renowned director Brian De Palma.Instilling the Miami set film with a sense of life rarely seen on cinema screens, De Palma's Scarface is a film not only made by its subject and actors but a film that is transcended by its locale becoming a key component of the story it harbors. Miami lives and breathes under De Palma's steady hand (despite it being filmed elsewhere in the majority) and the sense of opportunity it presents to its migrated Cubans can be not only sensed by the audience but felt also. De Palma is a director well known for his erratic efforts behind the camera for every Untouchables there's a Femme Fatale and for every Blow Out there's a Raising Cain, but here the director is in charge at every angle, every performance feels right, every brutal act of gang violence strikes a blow and every synthesised beat of Giorgio Moroder's now classic score resonates. It's a film that works on all levels and De Palma is the king of its unique domain.Scarface is a movie that speaks for itself, it is what it is and that's why it has become the masterpiece many now see it as being. De Palma's film is a 3 epic that from the first frame to the last is utterly and undeniable excessive and for all the right reasons. From esteemed professionals through to street gangbangers, Scarface speaks to that wannabe crime lord in all of us and gives to us in the form of Tony Montana a protagonist that unlike most others is unashamed of who and what he is and a protagonist that makes this movie such a blast of fresh air even these 30 plus years on.5 flying flamingos out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com ","genre":null},{"date":"9 June 2014","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Dripping in charisma, flooded with violence and profanity, filled with riotous drug use and centred around one of the most energy infused performances seen in cinematic history, Brian De Palma's Miami set 1983 gangster classic Scarface is a movie that sits on its black leathered throne high above all others before and all others since.

It's not hard to see why so many were put off by Al Pacino's frank and stunning turn as an immigrant who can think of nothing more than taking the world any way he can and taking no prisoners in doing so. It's interesting watching such a character at work in today's movie age in which all hero's and antiheroes must have a backbone as to why they do as they do, whereas Tony Montana just wants, he doesn't need a reason to own a tiger or rake in millions he just does it and enjoys doing so. It's a real testament to both the performance of Al Pacino and the script by Stone that this journey and man work the way they do as it would have been an easy feat for the movie to go off the rails without them at full strength which is the same as renowned director Brian De Palma.Instilling the Miami set film with a sense of life rarely seen on cinema screens, De Palma's Scarface is a film not only made by its subject and actors but a film that is transcended by its locale becoming a key component of the story it harbors.

It's a story that's simple yet so solid it draws you in and has you on the edge of your seat, then leaves you lamenting the pain of the films main character. A lone man, home from a war that nobody understood, hated and despised by the people who should have welcomed him home a hero. Rambo finds himself alone, his friends all dead and gone, haunted by the horrors of Vietnam and left with nowhere to turn. One simple decision to enter a small town brings him face to face with a hard nosed bigoted Sheriff who insists on thrusting Rambo into a whole new war. A war on his home soil and a war that will certainly lead to his death, but Rambo sees no other choice. With no way out, nowhere to turn and no idea how to ever really go home, Rambo decides to make his last stand.This is a film that speaks volumes to just about anyone willing to listen. It speaks to the pain and torment of those sent off to war, those who feel like outsiders no matter where they are and those who just want to be left alone to live in peace but always feel as though society just won't let them do it. From the comments about how Rambo wears his hair to the remarks about his jacket, just about everyone can identify with some part of this character. The hard nosed Sheriff (played brilliantly by Brian Dennehy) is a character practically everyone has run into in their lives. Be it a cop, a teacher, a coach or even a father figure we've all met or known this type of jackass. The type that can never look past the surface to stop and think maybe there's a reason a person looks the way they look and maybe a little understanding and compassion would be better than a firm hand or outright violence.Regardless, like many of us Rambo try's to move on peacefully. Try's to co-operate and even almost begs for an end to the rapidly escalating situation being pushed by the Sheriff. Other characters in the film, other police officers and even Colonel Trautmen (Rambos former commanding officer) all try to diffuse the situation as it gets worse and worse but the Sheriff just refuses to back down.The movie is so well written, so well paced and so well put together that by ten minutes in, your already on Rambos side and by the end that certainly doesn't change. I can't express enough how in love with this film I am. Stallone shines as Rambo, Dennehy and Crenna (Colonel Trautmen) are amazing in their roles and I quite seriously couldn't complain about a single part of this film. The musical score is brilliant and the theme song to the movie played during the films final moments reaches into your heart and grips it tightly. The filming locations are astonishingly perfect as well and the direction and editing are simply top notch.People can argue whether or not the war in Vietnam was justified and whether or not the world had any business trying to stop a communist takeover of South Vietnam. But the one thing no one should ever argue is whether or not our soldiers are to blame. They fought that war because they were told it was justified. They fought that war because they wanted to defend the innocent and defeat the evil of communism. In many cases they fought because they were drafted and had no choice and then, even when they could have won they weren't allowed to because the war wasn't publicly popular anymore. Many of those soldiers never came home, countless died on the battlefield and countless more were taken prisoner, tortured to death or held in prison camps never to be seen or heard from again. As the story of Rambo points out, even those that came home never really did. They came back forever traumatized facing a hostile public, no jobs, no work skills and next to nothing in their pockets. It's a sad, disgusting state of affairs that we've seen repeated again with the Afghanistan and Iraq wars of our times.I apologize if I'm getting off track and perhaps emotional, but it's an issue that touches me deeply for several reasons that I won't go into here but I felt the need to express myself in this review. This is not only a fantastic action film but it's also a touching portrait of the living hell that a soldier goes through, not only during a war but after and more often than not for the rest of their lives. To lighten up a little, this is quite simply a dam good movie that certainly should appeal to any guy and a lot of women as well. It's just an all around great action movie loaded with drama and some amazingly poignant moments. I have a collection of movie memorabilia and in amongst it are the knives from First Blood and First Blood II. I own this film on DVD, BluRay and in digital format. I've watched it again and again and if all that doesn't tell you this is a good movie, just watch it for yourself. Ditch the rowdy friends for a night (you know the type I'm talking about) shut off the phone and just sit down and take this film in, uninterrupted and let yourself feel every moment. I seriously defy you to dislike it.

What's surprising, in addition, is that the film actually has credible payoff in the end, and while existing mostly as a curious piece of cinema history, it also works to be an entertaining picture on a basic level.Tom Cruise stars as a United States Naval Aviator Lieutenant by the name of Pete Maverick Mitchell, a young, hot-shot aviator who loves flying and goofing off when he really should be working. His partner-and-crime and longtime friend, whom he considers family, is Nick Goose Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards), who has a wife and kid back home, but accepts Maverick mainly because of the fact that he doesn't have much else besides him. Maverick's father was killed in Vietnam, which only leaves Maverick in denial that his dad's death was because of circumstance, rather than the actuality of the situation being a personal mistake.After one goof-off session too many, Maverick and Goose are sent to Fighter Weapons School (nicknamed Top Gun) by their superior officer, who admires their talents but simply can't control them and recognizes they deserve to be placed in the elite squad of pilots. Upon arriving to Top Gun, Maverick meets a wonderful woman by the name of Charlotte Blackwood (Kelly McGillis), who he learns is his instructor during his time at the school. He also clashes with rival student Lieutenant Tom Iceman Kazanski (Val Kilmer), whom, while he detests on his competitive level, thoroughly admires him for his skill and devotion to flying.One of Top Gun's underlying strengths is how it doesn't settle for being another indistinguishable piece of action filmmaking nor a fluffy romantic piece with some disjointed shots of aerial combat thrown in as an excuse for screen writing diversity. The film also attempts to humanize the bond squadmates have with one another, and show how one comes of age when they are thrown into a group with extremely high expectations set on them. The issue here, however, is that writers Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr. throw those elements in the film at such an alarmingly fast rate that it's easy to miss these subtler, low-key elements that, in turn, work to make up the film.The scenes that do work and require no further contemplation are the scenes of aerial combat, which are clear, coherent, and intense thanks to Tony Scott's strong direction. With his shots and structure, Scott always strove for clarity even when it seemed that little could be established. Whether he was filming a runaway train or fighter jets circling around an area in the sky, appearing as if they were defying gravity with every nosedive and loop, Scott was clear and vivid with his direction. Give Scott some great, crystal-clear cinematography by Jeffrey L. Kimball - who worked with Scott through much of his career - and you have a visually distinct and astonishing picture.If only Kimball and Scott had better writing and acting to work with when it came down to structuring Top Gun's story. The film's story often feels too cluttered, as I said, struggling to fit so much into its one-hundred and nine minute runtime, and then on top of that, you have average acting by Cruise and McGillis, some strong work by Edwards, and some seriously mediocre and over-the-top acting by Kilmer, who throws scenes off instantly when he walks on screen. Top Gun is so structurally uneven that it is a blessing that the film has its unique visuals and strong cinematographical work going for it.Yet, there's something here I can't easily dismiss like I can with the barrage of other blockbusters I am put through every summer. Maybe it's the musical genius and simplicity of Kenny Loggins' signature song Danger Zone, which comes on about a dozen times in the film. Perhaps it's the gay subtext Quentin Tarantino's character Sid alluded to in the now famous monologue in the little-seen independent flick Sleep With Me that kept me alert and interested. Or perhaps it's just that this film is so American that is hurts at times. As difficult as it is to define and place, Top Gun can't be written off with a few words, and instead, must be given some solid care and attention as if it were an award-worthy movie rather than just a piece of summer fluff.Starring Tom Cruise, Kelly McGillis, Anthony Edwards, and Val Kilmer.

The issue here, however, is that writers Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr. throw those elements in the film at such an alarmingly fast rate that it's easy to miss these subtler, low-key elements that, in turn, work to make up the film.The scenes that do work and require no further contemplation are the scenes of aerial combat, which are clear, coherent, and intense thanks to Tony Scott's strong direction. With his shots and structure, Scott always strove for clarity even when it seemed that little could be established. Whether he was filming a runaway train or fighter jets circling around an area in the sky, appearing as if they were defying gravity with every nosedive and loop, Scott was clear and vivid with his direction. Give Scott some great, crystal-clear cinematography by Jeffrey L. Kimball - who worked with Scott through much of his career - and you have a visually distinct and astonishing picture.If only Kimball and Scott had better writing and acting to work with when it came down to structuring Top Gun's story. The film's story often feels too cluttered, as I said, struggling to fit so much into its one-hundred and nine minute runtime, and then on top of that, you have average acting by Cruise and McGillis, some strong work by Edwards, and some seriously mediocre and over-the-top acting by Kilmer, who throws scenes off instantly when he walks on screen. Top Gun is so structurally uneven that it is a blessing that the film has its unique visuals and strong cinematographical work going for it.Yet, there's something here I can't easily dismiss like I can with the barrage of other blockbusters I am put through every summer. Maybe it's the musical genius and simplicity of Kenny Loggins' signature song Danger Zone, which comes on about a dozen times in the film. Perhaps it's the gay subtext Quentin Tarantino's character Sid alluded to in the now famous monologue in the little-seen independent flick Sleep With Me that kept me alert and interested. Or perhaps it's just that this film is so American that is hurts at times. As difficult as it is to define and place, Top Gun can't be written off with a few words, and instead, must be given some solid care and attention as if it were an award-worthy movie rather than just a piece of summer fluff.Starring Tom Cruise, Kelly McGillis, Anthony Edwards, and Val Kilmer. Directed by Tony Scott.

The movie was definitely ahead of its time - especially with video effects; and the film really had an impact on how movies were made today. On top of that, it had absolutely chilling music that still managed to give goosebumps.The major thing that made me not enraptured by the film was the prolonged scenes that made the length of the movie unnecessarily long. I felt like several portions of the movie were drawn-out to make the viewer watch in awe of how amazing and advanced life is in the future and in space, which really diminishes the movies test of time. Upon the movies release it was likely enjoyable to watch those long and slow scenes, but today it feels otherwise.Aside from the movie not being as enjoyable to those who may have watched a plethora of more modern science fiction movies - it still is worth a watch, just to see how impressive it is for a movie made in the 60's.

The word notorious means famous for something bad; well known for some undesirable feature, quality or act (according to the Bing Dictionary). This film has its villains, so we could immediately assume it is a reference to them. But let's consider the other possibilities.Ingrid Bergman plays the role of Alicia Huberman, the daughter of a man convicted of treason by the U.S. She has a reputation for being a boozer and for not being too picky about her men. She surely fits the definition of notorious. All of these factors play a part in her selection by the U.S. government to gain useful intelligence.They send their agent, Devlin (Cary Grant), to recruit her. She eventually acquiesces without knowing exactly what her task will be. Alicia and Devlin are flown to Rio, Brazil, to await orders. While there, she overcomes her distrust of the American authorities as represented by Devlin. He overcomes his distaste for the seedy aspects of her reputation. They become involved. Though he won't utter the L word, clearly they both fall for each other.Then the assignment comes through Alicia is to infiltrate a suspicious group of Germans, a remnant of the German war machine. The local faction is headed by Alexander Sebastion (Claude Rains), a former friend of her father, and a man who used to be in love with Alicia. Clearly, they expect Alicia to insinuate herself into Sebastion's life romantically. At first, Devlin is outraged, but his distaste for the mission is tempered by patriotism. And a part of him wonders if Alicia will accept the mission, given their feelings for each other.What follows is a standoff. Devlin waits for her to reject the mission, proving that she truly has changed, proving her love for him. Alicia waits for Devlin to object to the mission, protecting her and proving his love for her. In the end, she agrees to connect with Sebastian. An emotional wall is erected between Alicia and Devlin, over which they lob insults at each other. At this point, we might ask if Devlin now possesses some undesirable features? He certainly becomes much less sympathetic, perhaps notoriously cruel toward Alicia.Once Alicia gets inside the Sebastian household, the suspense incrementally increases. Hitchcock is the master of suspense and he employs many of his usual tools to put the audience on edge. Note how the conventional ticking clock that counts down to disaster is replaced by the popping of corks, the dwindling champagne supply, the mere display of champagne flutes on screen.The camera zooms from the second floor to the foyer below and spots the critical key in Alicia's hand. It follows the key and like a conman playing a game of three care monte, even follows the hand where we think it might be. The camera repeatedly focuses on items and actions that represent danger the coffee cup wherever it is, the visual clues that something has been disturbed, Sebastian watching from across the room.Hitchcock's use of the camera in Notorious is remarkable. In many of his films the story is about a common man accidentally caught up in a story of intrigue. In Notorious, Alicia is the one who is caught in the web--even if voluntarily--and who is most victimized. Hitchcock uses her point of view repeatedly in the story, personalizing the action and making the audience identify with Alicia's fears.As great as Hitchcock's direction is in this film, Ben Hecht's script is remarkable. Note how the film starts, with one mystery after another What is this trial? Who is this woman at the trial? Why is she partying after the judgment? Who is this faceless man at her party? What is his authority?As the story moves along, one must marvel at Hecht's dialogue between the two lovers. Just enough is said and all the right things are left unsaid. Notice how little dialogue is used to take Alicia from a hard-boiled tramp to a soft-skinned romantic. He knew that it is better to show it than say it.Edith Head's design of Ms. Bergman's wardrobe is worth noting, making Alicia an object of desire that is worth fighting over or fretting over.Cary Grant's acting is up to its usual standards. He plays the devoted lover and the spurned ex-lover with equal gusto. Bergman's acting is worthy of even more note. In some scenes, you can watch the varying shades of emotion move across her face like passing clouds. The two of them were, apparently, most responsible for the long kiss\/embrace sequence that starts on the balcony in Rio. It was noteworthy in its day and it still tells us so much about the characters.Notorious is, at its center, a love story between two people who, due to circumstances, cannot allow themselves sentimentality. Their lack of communication actually becomes an element of suspense. This is one of Hitchcock's great films, of which there are many.
