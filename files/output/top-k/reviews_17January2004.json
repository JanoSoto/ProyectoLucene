He has tremendous spirit. His true talent lies in writing, for he is an accomplished playwright who directs and produces them starring his very own Max Fischer Players and is the Founder and or President of every club on campus. But his grades are horrible. He is put on academic probation. Things get thick when Max is inspired by a depressed millionare, Herman Blume (Bill Murray). Also, he falls in love with 1st grade teacher Ms. Cross (Olivia Williams). Max shows his true lack of social skills when he feverishly attempts at courting her, only to be in compitition with Blume. The movie is bascically a Love Triangle between a bright student who thinks he can get anything he wants, a married businessman, and a pretty school teacher. The movie is lots of fun and is an ode to loners everywhere who want to find love. It's mostly dark sorts of humor, but there's that certain tone and attitude that director Wes Anderson adds to each of his movies that is uniuqe and refreshing.RATING **** out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"17 January 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Rushmore is not only the name of the movie, but it's the name of the prestigous private school that 15 year old Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) attends.

But man was he great in this movie. I mean it was such a good performance. This movie is director Wes Anderson's (Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic) feature directorial debut. It's about a group of misfit friends that decide to take up a life of crime. The group includes Anthony (Luke Wilson) just got out of the nut house and is searching for himself. Dignan (Owen Wilson, co-wrote the movie with Anderson) is the confident but bumbling ringleader who wants to be notorious but doesn't know how to execute a plan to save his life. And Bob (Robert Musgrave) the driver\/look out who just wants a little recognition. The movie follows their misadventures of them robbing a bookstore, going on the lamb, Anthony falling in love with a Motel maid who instills joy back in his life, and Dignan's 'big score' that involves his former employer. The subtle humor and deliveries by the actors make the movie stand out in it's own little version comedy. The characters are losers, but lovable. You can't help but cheer them on even though what they do is illegal. I highly recommend this cool little film. It's an excellent introduction into the wonderful films of Wes Anderson.RATING **** out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"17 January 2004","score":"76 out of 98 people found the following review useful","review":"  In anything.
