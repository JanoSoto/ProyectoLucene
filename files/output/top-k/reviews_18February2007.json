That being terrorism often hurts the innocent much more than the declared enemy. In the Name of the Father is a powerful, well-acted drama about terrorism and injustice. And also the love one man feels for his father. Some of the events in this film are factual, and others are not. Despite some liberties taken with history, the film still makes a strong point, however.Daniel Day-Lewis plays Gerry Conlon, a young man falsely accused along with several other friends and family members, of bombing a London pub in 1974. The bombing, performed by the IRA, killed a few persons and wounded several others. Conlon and his friends just happen to be near by when the bombing takes place. Through police torture, Conlon and his best friend confess to the crime, thinking a trial will exonerate them. Trouble is, there had been so many recent bombings that the legal system in Britain was just crying out for a scapegoat. Conlon and four friends are given life sentences. Several members of Conlon's family are also given stiff jail sentences. Even his own father who seems to be the most righteous and kind person imaginable and who never set foot in England at all during the time of the bombing!The film starts out like a shot from a cannon, as we see just how violent and chaotic Blefast was during the early seventies. Just living a normal life looked impossible. If the British troops weren't after you, then the IRA members were. The film also scores when we see Conlon head off to London to presumably make a better life for himself. He and a friend force themselves into a commune and enjoy a brief period of free love and decadence. The film gets very heavy once Conlon is arrested and tortured. And the last hour detailing his time behind bars is just plain somber. We watch his father just sort of waste away with him behind bars while an aggressive lawyer (Emma Thompson) fights to get them out. Pete Postletwaite is exceptional as Gerry's father, and seeing him grow sicker and weak is very difficult for the viewer. The film tries to shift gears down the stretch and show how Conlon has become determined and more radicalized, but these scenes are nothing spectacular. Even the conclusion seems a little anti-climatic, but at least we see some justice finally get done. The acting is very, very good. Lewis is as good as ever, and nobody looks out of their league. There are some historical liberties taken. Gerry and his father never actually lived in the same cell, for instance. Overall, this film will stick with you, though.In watching this film, one cannot help but feel for the victims of terrorism. I have personally not much knowledge of the conflict between the IRA and Britain, except to say that I'm well aware of how long and deep the scars run between the English and Irish peoples. That said, there is simply no excuse for terrorism. Look at how many victims that pub bombing created. Not only those who perished or were injured. That act of terror sent several innocent people to jail and ruined their lives! The British legal system is certainly to blame for sending the wrong people to jail, but would this have even happened if the IRA had not bombed that pub? A similar situation can be seen in the Middle East today. Radical Muslims look to strike out at Western interests, but their actions often hurt scores more other Muslims than any actual Western interests!

I was encouraged to see ENEMY AT THE GATES by my friend who told me It's a masterpiece. After the first viewing, I could not notice any aspects of a masterpiece; later, however, I could find some strong points, which finally did not change much in my opinion. ENEMY AT THE GATES tells the story of Stalingrad from a particularly subjective point of view. As a result, it causes some serious historical travesty (which has already been discussed in other comments) in spite of the fact that at the beginning, it interestingly presents the map of that time, which would indicate that it's gonna be a serious historical work. However, it is not the only film that does that travesty and, therefore, I would rather concentrate on its cinematic values than focus on it as a history lesson. Let me look at it as a film only.CRUCIAL ERROR The movie lasts for 2 hours. It is true that it keeps your attention. It more or less accurately shows the atmosphere that must have been in the ruined Stalingrad then. It does show the misery of war and the loss of human feelings that war promotes The one with the rifle shoots. Moreover, it contains quite an interesting story of the main characters. Yet, its crucial error is that it MOSTLY concentrates on snipers' cat-and-mouse game (as it has wisely been called in the plot outline) between Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) and Major Koenig (Ed Harris). That is Stalingrad, that's meant to symbolize the battle. Koenig is the enemy at the gates since he is a German. That not only results in serious misunderstanding but it also has its consequences in the lack of character development combined with clichés. We have many characters and yet, they are mostly names and faces, not more. There is no insight into their feelings, emotions, tragedies. There is one little exception the character of a young boy Sacha (Gabriel Thomson) is interesting. His tragic story is a true tearjerker. Nevertheless, even this is centered on Vassili. Therefore, the film should not be titled ENEMY AT THE GATES but VASSILI-A HEROIC SNIPER. Finally, one sniper (Koenig) dies in a very illogical scene... Was that realistic to try to shoot so many times and once believe that it's the perfect shot...REALISM and REFLECTIONS I admit that the film is quite realistic in general. There are unforgettable moments like the one on the boat or bombarding. It also contains profound thoughts. Consider, for instance, the last words of Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), Vassili's friend There are always rich and poor, rich in gifts, poor in gifts... I also loved the idea the director presents the blindness of communist regime. You watch the film and after 20 minutes you get totally upset-and you ask yourself Did they really do such things to their own people? But this blindness and fanaticism is wonderfully conveyed by Chrushchev (Bob Hoskins) so worried about Russians s...... their pants. If you decide to see this film, pay attention to the moment Vassili is at Chrushchev and a big picture of Stalin (Boss) is hanging on the wall... Good scene!LOVE STORY The character of Vassili is not only developed in terms of sniper skills but also in terms of male-female relationship. Vassili is after Tania (Rachel Weisz) an intelligent Jewish girl whom he gets to know in the house of Sacha. The way their love is expressed as a growing feeling is good. That feeling seems to win at the end. However, their performances make it unnatural. Neither Jude Law nor Rachel Weisz are appealing as a pair. I have rarely seen a movie where there is hardly any chemistry between the couple as here. Maybe, some people will not agree with me but that is what I think and I had to say it. The moment of their love scene is foremost lust and nothing more.TECHNICAL POINT From the technical point of view, the movie is not bad. There are impressive shots of crowds of people, there are very good shots of snipers' fight (but too long as aforementioned). There are also SOME good performances. Generally, if there was no love plot, I liked Jude Law as Vassili. I can forgive him the British accent which does not suit to the Russian character. I also liked Joseph Fiennes as Danilov and Ed Harris as cold, elegant and brutal Koenig. Yet, there are two people who really do great jobs Bob Hoskins as Chrushchev and Gabriel Thomson as Sacha. There is a FEELING in these performances. Hoskins, no wonder, since he is a very good actor considering his many roles. But Thomson, a young boy who acts like a professional, is a real surprise. They raise the value of the film.I rate the film 7\/10 because of some factors like performances, the justice it partly does to communism and its blindness. Yet, as I said before, it's far from masterpiece. If you really like WWII movies, I recommend you to see ENEMY AT THE GATES and evaluate for yourself (perhaps compare to other movies). However, if you are someone who cannot stand bombarding, shooting, blood, cruelty, helplessness - stay away! Although the end is not that dramatic, the movie is overall very upsetting. The film attempts to answer the question Were there no humans then? Was it only war which did that? Supposedly, not only war. The world was governed by comrades whose only sacred duty was to serve the power of the totalitarian regime that once lasted under the name of Soviet Union.

The film attempts to answer the question Were there no humans then? Was it only war which did that? Supposedly, not only war. The world was governed by comrades whose only sacred duty was to serve the power of the totalitarian regime that once lasted under the name of Soviet Union.

Throughout the movie, you witness various conversations between people pondering this question among other things that we would tie in with the meaning of life. The dialogue is great in the sense that it shows a higher level of thought than you encounter with most movies, however, this is also where the movie becomes rather transparent. While the theme of the movie should provide a rather gripping storyline, there really is no story. The movie erratically pulls you from one conversation to the next, and while it provides you with a reason for this at the end, it really just seems like an excuse for the movie trying too hard to sound intelligent. A movie like, let's say, Donnie Darko, provides you with engaging philosophical dialogue that also creates a bond between you and the character. Waking Life provides no such character development. Most movies that try to make the viewer think start with an idea and then the writers say how can we make the characters interesting and also make the dialogue appealing to someone who is a deep thinker?. Waking Life seems like they came up with the dialogue and then said well let's make up some characters to say all this stuff and then piece it into a film. This is why the movie ultimately fails in my mind. The characters are boring and one dimensional, with the only personality types really being thoughtful, caring, and philosophical with three or four more outlandish speakers. You don't care what happens to the characters, and while you want to hear what they have to say, they are just so incredibly boring that you feel restless.

They sit secluded from the rest of society spending all their time pondering the meaning of life without realizing that while it is important to ask the big questions, you will never even come close to finding out the meaning of life unless you go out and have real life experiences. This is ironic because it is apparent that the movie is trying to make you admire these characters through their thought provoking speeches, and trust me, they are less than admirable, in fact a better word would be pathetic. Some of the questions these people pose aren't even that deep. One woman tells her friend You know how our cells continuously regenerate? Well every seven years we are composed of completely new cells than we were before, but if I am composed of all new cells how can I be the same person?. Am I the only one who knows anything about cytology? It's simple honey, your cells divide through binary fission, and every cell is identical to its predecessor. A skin cell is going to be the same as every other skin cell you have had, same goes for a brain cell, and that's why you are the same. Somehow they even ruined the cinematography, which originally seemed brilliant. The animated characters always seem to be warping or twisting, and if they aren't the background is. I couldn't help but feeling though that if they had developed the characters more, they could have done more with this style of animation to dazzle the viewer.I can use one word to describe this movie pretentious. It talks the talk but it really doesn't walk the walk. It's got great dialogue but the characters and story have no substance, and if all you've got is thought provoking dialogue, write a thesis and leave it at that.

At first I thought that maybe it was a parody of a really bad teen movie, but my daughter told me that it was for real. So I watched it. It was mildly interesting. I have read some comments that Mandy Moore ( now I finally know who she is!) has made, and that girl seems to actually have some brain cells in her head, as opposed to another famous blond whose airheadedness is exploited in Fahrenheit 911. So, Mandy herself sounds at least, like a cool person, who has some original thoughts. Uh, but as far as this movie....well, I'll try to be gentle. First of all, it was painfully bad. I thought it was perhaps a college student's film project. All the music was generic, typical teen angst same exact melody, same guy singer, music. The acting was not bad. But the story? so predictable....I mean, a motherless girl? Where have I seen that before? Why do all these plain girls who end up with the cool guy have to be motherless? what's with that? is it a throwback to Cinderella, and snow white, and ariel? So, that right there, that she has to be motherless is annoying, and a copy of all the other teen movies. Then, you are supposed to fall in love with her at the play, and I didn't. I guess that's just cuz I'm cold-hearted. I liked how he defended her in the cafeteria, though. Anyway, the movie was funny, and I was getting a little bored with the predictability, until the Love Story, I'm dying plot twist. Okay, that was a bit surprising. But then, they stole, in the LAMEST way possible, the whole idea of a dying, beautiful leukemia patient ( see Love Story, you young-ins out there, please!! )and then had the nerve to work a ten second dad helps out like in Love Story! Hello?????? When Landon and his dad were hugging, I almost expected his dad to blurt out love means never having to say you're sorry!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was bad, bad, bad. And then?? the narration starts?? what's with that? Was there narration at the beginning of the movie, that I missed???The movie seems to have been written by 2 different folks, one writing the first half, then the other, doing the second half. The narration at the end is what christened the movie a comedy, and did give me a chuckle. But, all in all, I'll say that the kids are young and good looking, and the acting pretty good. And, I read another review here which complained about yet another humble, plain jane, outcast girl being played by a slim beauty, and that writer does have a point. I never looked at it from that perspective, but that does make sense. I don't think the movie was trying to make any point, though, just being a good watch to accompany toast and peanut butter. And I will say this I am glad that lots of young people like this movie. When I was a teen, I loved a silly movie entitled Buster and Billie. If I saw it today for the first time, I'd probably make fun of it worse than this one. So, it's good for teens to have a tear jerker that they can love. So for that reason, and that reason alone, I ( guess ) I like this movie.

At first I thought that maybe it was a parody of a really bad teen movie, but my daughter told me that it was for real. So I watched it. It was mildly interesting. I have read some comments that Mandy Moore ( now I finally know who she is!) has made, and that girl seems to actually have some brain cells in her head, as opposed to another famous blond whose airheadedness is exploited in Fahrenheit 911. So, Mandy herself sounds at least, like a cool person, who has some original thoughts. Uh, but as far as this movie....well, I'll try to be gentle. First of all, it was painfully bad. I thought it was perhaps a college student's film project. All the music was generic, typical teen angst same exact melody, same guy singer, music. The acting was not bad. But the story? so predictable....I mean, a motherless girl? Where have I seen that before?

That's in large part on account of its existential, post-Christian theme, it being a rare horror movie that not only eschews the supernatural but fairly cries out against concepts of a caring divinity or an afterlife.No wonder the makers felt they needed to say something at the outset about the mistake Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) made of conducting his experiment without reckoning with God. Clearly the idea is to put 1931 moviegoers more at ease, but this introduction, so wryly given by one of the film's actors, Edward Van Sloan, also pushes forward the atheistic theme the rest of the film will pursue less gingerly.Cooped up in a lonely watchtower set against a dark, foreboding sky, Dr. Frankenstein builds his own blasphemy stitched together from robbed bodies. Given life by lightning, the Monster (Boris Karloff) quickly gives Frankenstein cause to regret his creation, while sowing terror across the countryside.Have you ever wanted to do something that was dangerous? Dr. Frankenstein asks his former mentor Waldman (Van Sloan). It's this transgressive quality, both in the character and the film named after him, which gives Frankenstein much of its frisson even today.The chills begin right away, when we first observe Dr. Frankenstein and his assistant Fritz skulking around the edges of the world's spookiest cemetery, watching hollow-faced extras who look a few short breaths away from their own funerals mourning someone whose body Henry plans to steal. No middle-class moralist he!There's a lot of artful gloom in Frankenstein, part of it carried over from German expressionist cinema like The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari (Dwight Frye as Fritz, Frankenstein's assistant, performs a function here similar to Conrad Veidt's in Caligari) and part of it the function of director James Whale and the others responsible for the look of the film; set dressers, special effects hands, and most notably makeup man Jack Pierce, who gave Karloff his distinctive, deathly look, stronger here than it would ever be again.Frankenstein holds true to its hard tone at some loss to the picture's quality. There is little humor or light in this film, something sorely missed in a dated period piece like this, and the acting around Clive is notably weak across the board, except for Frye and of course, Karloff. It helps Boris that his character remains mute, what with exchanges like But Elizabeth, you can't do that! I must! pocking the script. Clive does well, albeit with a character who is rather inconsistent, going all of a sudden from ready lawbreaker to civic paragon. In the denouement he isn't chased by a mob, but leading it.Though stitches do show in this somewhat patchwork creation (sorry, couldn't resist), there is resilient majesty in its greatest scenes, like our first glimpse of Frankenstein's face (three close ups, each moving further in from a different angle) and the dreadful image near the end of the father taking his daughter in to the village fair.

Annette Bening plays Claire Cooper, an artist with a pilot husband, Paul (Aidan Quinn) and a young daughter, Rebecca. Claire has strange dreams all the time, about a valley town that is now underwater after a reservoir was created in it's place. Some of the dreams she believe are connected to a missing girl. But when Claire's own daughter goes missing and is found at the bottom of lake (where the underwater town lies), she realizes her dreams are foretelling future events. Convinced that a psychopathic child-murderer (Robert Downey Jr.) is channeling her mind, everyone around her begins to think she is insane, while she tries to stop him from killing his next victim.This was one strange movie, and I'll openly admit that. It was pretty off-the-wall. But I think that may be why I enjoyed it so much. I've never seen a film quite like this one, ever, and I admired that about it. The story is written both cleverly but also very incoherently (at times), but not to the point of total confusion - I understood everything that was happening, unlike some people who apparently have complained that the film was far too confusing. I don't understand that, because the film made perfect sense to me. As long as you are paying attention, I see no reason why this film should become so confusing that you have no idea what is happening on screen - it really isn't that complicated. There are some very scary scenes and images that will stick in your mind and won't be easily shaken.Aside from the unusually involving plot, is the stunning visual effects and cinematography - this film looks beautiful. Various angles, amazing locations, and wonderful sets make this film pure eye candy. The New England countryside is both eerie and beautiful at the same time, and the entire underwater town presented in the film is strange but also very neat-looking. The color red is consistent in the film that is a symbol, especially to the protagonist. Apples are seen throughout the film constantly, also symbolizing the strange dreams. The dream sequences are eerie and also visually stunning. Atmosphere in the film is very heavy. Annette Bening plays the lead, and she's a sympathetic character who everyone else believes is extremely insane, which is understandable. Aidan Quinn is her confused husband, and Stephen Rea plays a psychologist. And Robert Downey, Jr. plays the menacing serial killer, in a completely bizarre but well-done performance. The character he plays is strange and scary, and he does it well. The entire cast performs well. The conclusion to the movie is a little ambiguous and daring, but I liked how everything came together.Overall, In Dreams is a bizarre but stylish horror movie that is genuinely scary, very suspenseful, and unlike any horror movie I've yet to see. The acting is great and the film visually looks great. The low rating here on IMDb surprised me, but apparently a lot of people didn't like this film. As for me, I thought it was excellent. I'd recommend this film to fans of psychological horror, it's sure to please them. Very spooky and well done. 8\/10.

I don't understand that, because the film made perfect sense to me. As long as you are paying attention, I see no reason why this film should become so confusing that you have no idea what is happening on screen - it really isn't that complicated. There are some very scary scenes and images that will stick in your mind and won't be easily shaken.Aside from the unusually involving plot, is the stunning visual effects and cinematography - this film looks beautiful. Various angles, amazing locations, and wonderful sets make this film pure eye candy. The New England countryside is both eerie and beautiful at the same time, and the entire underwater town presented in the film is strange but also very neat-looking. The color red is consistent in the film that is a symbol, especially to the protagonist. Apples are seen throughout the film constantly, also symbolizing the strange dreams. The dream sequences are eerie and also visually stunning. Atmosphere in the film is very heavy. Annette Bening plays the lead, and she's a sympathetic character who everyone else believes is extremely insane, which is understandable. Aidan Quinn is her confused husband, and Stephen Rea plays a psychologist. And Robert Downey, Jr. plays the menacing serial killer, in a completely bizarre but well-done performance. The character he plays is strange and scary, and he does it well. The entire cast performs well. The conclusion to the movie is a little ambiguous and daring, but I liked how everything came together.Overall, In Dreams is a bizarre but stylish horror movie that is genuinely scary, very suspenseful, and unlike any horror movie I've yet to see. The acting is great and the film visually looks great. The low rating here on IMDb surprised me, but apparently a lot of people didn't like this film. As for me, I thought it was excellent. I'd recommend this film to fans of psychological horror, it's sure to please them. Very spooky and well done. 8\/10.

Nothing too serious, just a simple but original premise, some well-handled tension, cool makeup effects and a nice healthy dose of gore and violence to round things off. Compared to its most immediate rival, An American Werewolf in London though it comes up second place, so why in the name of heaven it spawned so many follow ups is something of a mystery. The series is up to its seventh entry thus far and if the diminishing laws of sequels is anything to go on, they must be unspeakably terrible because Howling 3 (the only one I've been bored\/curious\/stupid enough to sit through) is so bad I'd have to say it's one of the worst films I've ever seen.The principle reason for this is the premise, as director Philippe Mora decides to do away with the original's everyday people versus rampaging monsters approach and instead, provides us with what must be the only Marsupial Werewolf Romance Epic in movie history. The script is massively overambitious, the acting so bad the cast might as well have been made of cardboard and any promise of bloodthirsty violence a la the original goes forever unsatisfied. You might get a few laughs out of it, but ultimately it's just a very poor film.The overambitious storyline considers an anthropologist, Dr Beckmeyer (Inspector Clouseau lookalike Barry Otto) and his studies of a race of marsupial werewolf people discovered in Australia. Mixed up in all this is a Russian ballet dancer who is secretly a non-marsupial werewolf herself come to breed with the Australians, a B-movie actress from the countryside who is also a werewolf and an idiot movie talent spotter who's fallen in love with her. So blindly in love with her in fact that he doesn't bat an eyelid when he first notices how hairy she is. Dr Beckmeyer is determined to prove that the werewolves are not to be frightened of and that studying them is the best approach, the Government is not so certain and wants to destroy them and eventually, after a painfully long set up, he joins up with the lycanthropes in an attempt to lead them to safety in the outback.You might think a film with 'Marsupial Werewolves' in might be entertaining. It isn't. The delivery is slow and tedious, with characters and subplots being introduced with no concern for cohesion and what should have been a campy, violent and fun film instead is dull, pretentious twaddle. Indeed, the only attraction to come from this is Imogen Annesley, a very attractive young woman whose career has failed to take off since the high point of stripping naked in a barn, giving birth to a rodent thing and having it crawl up her belly and into a kangaroo pouch on her abdomen. She might be gorgeous in a I wish you weren't a hideous mutant freak monster kind of way but she's more or less the only noteworthy thing deserving praise in the entire sorry enterprise. Oh and Dame Edna pops up at the end.So there you have it, a werewolf movie with a humanitarian message. Great, that's just what we needed. If you're a film student looking for a lesson in how not to make a movie you might just be capable of scraping some little residue of a hint out of this, but if not, I'd advise avoiding this movie like the bubonic plague.

As good as Hanks is as Woody and Allen as Buzz Armstrong, I think the supporting characters just about stole the show Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc.Multiple viewings don't diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed winner as is the sequel.

It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too.When this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome.

I think you get the point! Besides., he is a very talented director. I hope he develops a film project very soon and finds himself in the director's chair. Dragonfly is not only a favorite of mine but also my 2 daughters-ages 17 and 22-and we watched it again on this sunny Sunday in California. Imagine, parents and their kids enjoying the same film together. It's almost hard to believe. Also, every time we view Dragonfly it is always followed up with a discussion and or debate regarding the dragonfly symbol to children being diagnosed with terminal cancer and donor questions While this movie explores life and death issues on several levels, the main crux is about receiving a message -a very important message in this case-from a loved one who has passed away.This movie will not only tear at your heart strings butit will keep you in suspense till the end. Although the movie is dedicated to Katherine Ann Curtis , there is no information as to whether she is deceased. Just wondering.
