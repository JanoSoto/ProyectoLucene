Trey Parker and Matt Stone are responsible for South Park, which at it's best is very funny. Putting them together, and you get one of the funniest sports parody movies ever!The plot, and that's not really important is as follows  Two slackers (Parker and Stone) invent a new sport called Baseketball, a combination of Basketball and Baseball (naturally!). With rules involving psyching out your opponents by any means possible, it soon catches on through-out the country. When an unscrupulous owner of another club (Robert Vaughan) tries to change the rules, it's left to Parker and Stone to save the day.The plot however, is merely an excuse for one of the funniest movies I've seen. Zucker, as he did when co-writing Airplane and The Naked Gun series, simply crams the movie with gag after gag. Some are visual, in the background while something more serious might be happening near the camera, or simply in the dialog which is hysterical. He also directs the material well.Trey Parker and Matt Stone as Cooper and Remer acquit themselves well in the main roles. The supporting cast, led by Vaughan, are all good, getting the performances spot on. Special mention must go to Dian Bachar as Kenny 'Squeak' Scolari. The abuse he suffers during the movie gets a lot of laughs. I wonder if naming him Kenny was Parker and Stone's idea. After all, look what another Kenny goes through in South Park!What makes this work, unlike Epic Movie, Meet The Spartans, Date Movie and such, is that it's not movie specific. Baseketball targets the sport movie genre, then crams in as many jokes as it can. Recent so-called parody movies seem to think selecting one movie to spoof, then adding other things in will work. It doesn't. Of course it also helps if you can get writers to make your movie funny too!Baseketball seems to have become a forgotten movie. I can't understand why. It's funnier than more recent parodies, and shows how good Parker and Stone can be in front of the camera.It's a very funny movie and one that deserves to more well-known!

I must agree that John Toll wields his camera with devastating effect, capturing some majestic Scottish countryside and breathing life (and much death) into some spectacularly choreographed battle scenes. However the other two awards I really find myself questioning.Don't get me wrong here, Braveheart is a worthy piece of entertainment of epic proportions, but proportions aren't everything. Technically the film is near flawless, with Toll's superb camera work backed up by artistic and very realistic makeup, fantastic sound and sound effects (makeup and sound effects won Oscars), top notch editing, striking costumes, convincing art and another strong, inspiring score form military soundtrack master James Horner (Aliens, Glory and Apollo 13).Gibson does direct with a purpose, setting out to make an epic, he gets almost everything right. Randall Wallace (any relation to the great William?) provides a sound screenplay, which seems to be quite historically accurate, even if it may take creative licence in the more private affairs of the mighty William Wallace. What screenwriter Randall does not do is allow us to really get into the head of the fearsome Scot, leaving us with only suggestions as to what motivated him. Lack of character depth, and therefore appreciation, can probably also be attributed to the absence of outstanding acting, which is the real reason Braveheart falls short of its enormous potential. A couple of knockout performances would have made this film an indelible memory, but alas none of the strong support cast (including Sophie Marceau, Patrick McGoohan, Catherine McCormack, Brenda Gleeson, Angus McFadyen, James Cosmo, David O'Hara, Peter Henly, James Robinson, Alun Armstrong and Ian Bannen) were able to turn in anything more than a 'thoroughly enjoyable'. And honestly, though we all love Mel with a passion, he's no' William Wallace, now is he? Gibson is always a pleasure on screen, and he does a good job with the accent, but I for one was never really convinced that this was the man who freed Scotland form the tyranny of English rule.Having said all that, I would not hesitate to recommend Braveheart to all audiences who crave a blood stirring, passionate film, especially those who, like myself, have Scottish heritage.

Some people could agree with the 'Charles Manson' of modern day society (Tyler Durden-Pitt) and say that our world is turning in a direction of which we cannot follow, and that if we cannot find reason to be different or not cater to the white-collars, then we need to pummel each other to take out bottled up anger that is created during a day in our little cubicles, suffocating in the depths of paperwork prescribed by our bosses and many other reasons to punch holes through our cheeks. Edward Norton is the lead, and does the average Joe justice as the insomniac looking for a way to escape from the day to day life that our environment is nurtering. And, after going to self-help groups for men and woman who have cancer, he meets a mysterious woman who could threaten his relief, a woman who he believes has no such cancer. On a plane a short period after, he meets the man who took control of his demeanor and the very way he talked, thinked and judged society. After a nice talk about air travel, they part ways.

Tyler Durden requests one favor before he can stay with him he wants Norton to hit him as hard as he can.

Now, the story then goes from a club for men attempting fiendishly to channel the aggression they could not before, turns into a movie about vandalism and bleak terrorizer to our society. The first few words in the book is Tyler saying, the first step to eternal life is you have to die. The last words are God whispering we need to break up civilization so we can make something better of the world.

When the team is ambushed and Hawke comes out unscathed, he is immediately suspect and must prove himself innocent of the charge of betrayal, all the while avoiding capture. This catalyst sets the film going as Ethan finds a couple of sympathisers in the disavowed Krieger and Luther. With their help Hawke begins to put the pieces of the puzzle together, and starts to uncover the identity of the real mole.Whole cast are thoroughly enjoyable, with Cruise leading the way, supported by the lovely Emmanuelle Beart, the increasingly entertaining duo of Jean Reno (Krieger) and Ving Rhames (Luther), and Jon Voight as group leader Jim Phelps. There are a couple of surprise cameos too, form the likes of Kristin Scott-Thomas and Vanessa Redgrave. Obviously it's the look, the pace and the seemingly complex plot that really make the film however.Cinematography, art and sets are all eye catching as the action jumps from one continent to another and back again. Special effects crew (the amazing ILM) save their best for last in the mind blowing finale, set in the London to Paris rail tunnel. Editing keeps the tempo nicely upbeat, while the groovy original theme (Lalo Schifrin) and new music (Danny Elfman) provide fantastic backing.The most effective piece of film making has come from director DePalma and his screenwriters. In presenting the storyline very patchily, it appears to have more depth and intrigue than is the case. The plot presentation is so vague in fact that many viewers have complained about being unable to follow the narrative.

With their help Hawke begins to put the pieces of the puzzle together, and starts to uncover the identity of the real mole.Whole cast are thoroughly enjoyable, with Cruise leading the way, supported by the lovely Emmanuelle Beart, the increasingly entertaining duo of Jean Reno (Krieger) and Ving Rhames (Luther), and Jon Voight as group leader Jim Phelps. There are a couple of surprise cameos too, form the likes of Kristin Scott-Thomas and Vanessa Redgrave. Obviously it's the look, the pace and the seemingly complex plot that really make the film however.Cinematography, art and sets are all eye catching as the action jumps from one continent to another and back again. Special effects crew (the amazing ILM) save their best for last in the mind blowing finale, set in the London to Paris rail tunnel. Editing keeps the tempo nicely upbeat, while the groovy original theme (Lalo Schifrin) and new music (Danny Elfman) provide fantastic backing.The most effective piece of film making has come from director DePalma and his screenwriters. In presenting the storyline very patchily, it appears to have more depth and intrigue than is the case. The plot presentation is so vague in fact that many viewers have complained about being unable to follow the narrative. In truth, the basic premise and outlay are very simple, yet elusive in detail, thus gaining maximum points from audiences seeking a twisting, winding tale. Careful scrutiny and a little analytical after thought will dissolve the mystery and help you understand what went on.Not quite a master stroke, but Mission  Impossible is a flash of genius in the making of an action\/thriller form the multi-talented, hit and miss Brian DePalma. Tom Cruise fans, you're in for a treat!Wednesday, July 24, 1996 - Knox District CentreDe Palma's sharply twisting action pic features an expertly arranged screenplay which milks maximum effect from the deceptively complex story. The taut, if stretched, action sequences add to the tension.Lalo Schifrin's original score is cleverly re-worked and it accompanies the enjoyable turns of Cruise, Emmanuelle Seigner, Jon Voight, Jean Reno, Ving Rhames and an uncredited Emilio Estevez.The camera crew and f\/x teams add to the spectacle.Saturday, November 22, 1997 - Video ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"26 March 2008","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The best detective stories allow their central arc of enigmatic mystery to unravel slowly, leaving behind a trail of clues for the audience to follow. Therefore, it is important when adapting the story to a medium such as film that the clues aren't signalled too early, giving the audience the chance to search in the dark with only a few subtle elements of light to work with. It is also important that the film and its various strands of character, theme and narrative all eventually lead to the same place, confounding but also confirming what the viewer had expected all along.The Crimson Rivers (2000) by La Haine (1995) director Mathieu Kassovitz sticks to this method fairly closely for the most part; giving us the usual archetypes familiar from this kind of heavily investigatory detective fiction alongside the usual contemporary preoccupations with dark, gloomy, atmospheric visuals and intriguing, idiosyncratic characters. It is also refreshing to see a director intelligent enough to allow the film's location to become the centre of their story; framing his scenes so that the ominous presence of the towering French Alps casts a foreboding and omnipotent shadow across these characters and the story itself to perfectly set up a certain sense of the foreshadowing of later, thematic events. As the Alps hold a serious significance over the direction the narrative will take, Kassovitz understandably exploits the set up perfectly; using forced perspectives to give the impression of the characters gradually being surrounded, even asphyxiated by the landscape, to create a more potent feeling of suffocating claustrophobia.The idea of claustrophobia is mirrored by the interior production design, which dwarfs our protagonists against low ceilings cracked with damp, drab, monochromatic tones and deeper shades of autumn, and stark, naturalistic lighting with plenty of shadows. These visuals complement the narrative beautifully, going beyond the obvious and somewhat lazy comparisons to David Fincher's classic detective thriller Se7en (1996) to create a style and atmosphere that seems just right for this kind of twisted, slow-building set up. The story is admittedly fairly well worn, with two seemingly mismatched cops thrown together in the pursuit of a vicious serial killer and slowly developing a strong bond as their lives and rank are thrown into jeopardy and confusion. So essentially we're dealing with the typical buddy-cop clichés, though with more believability and less reliance on comic relief, with any real attempt at humour usually undercut by the explicitness of the violence and that fantastic air of dark, disturbing dread.The central performances from Jean Reno and Vincent Cassel are both very good, with Reno portraying the older, wiser, more intuitive detective paired off with Cassel's headstrong loose cannon. Combined with that fantastic build up of slow burning tension, the intricacies of the plot and the thick air of pure atmospheric dread, we should be looking at a standout, A+, modern-day crime thriller. Unfortunately, the last ten minutes of the film suffer from a serious drop off, creating a dénouement worthy of the worst kind of late night B-movie or TV thriller. It's a real shame too, with the first hour of the film creating such a searing and enigmatic sense of mystery that really draws us, in before the pieces of the puzzle are blown away by a bizarre climax that stretches plausibility beyond breaking point. As a result, the ending seems like an anachronism within the film's post-modern framework; offering us all the answers presented at once in a manner that seems incredibly lazy and unfair given the great sense of mystery that was previously unfolding.In this respect, I would draw comparisons to two of the most recent films by Italian horror\/thriller director Dario Argento, in particular Sleepless (2000) and The Card Player (2004). Both of these films feature a great first half rife with mystery and suspense, but loose it in the final act with a complete disregard for logic, character or the thrill of expectation. In similar fashion, the first hour of The Crimson Rivers is excellent; great style, great characters and a story that pulls us in. Unfortunately, the pace cannot be maintained and the end of the film will no doubt leave many viewers angry, confused and severely disappointed.
