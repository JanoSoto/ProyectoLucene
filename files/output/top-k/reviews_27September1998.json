John Waters' tribute to the people he loves most (Baltimoreans) is a twisted little ditty with plenty to look at and laugh at.  It's like being turned loose in a museum of kitsch!  I haven't laughed so much in a theater since Serial Mom.  I loved seeing old friends from the Dreamland  days, Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe, back in front of Waters' camera.  The cast is simply wonderful (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton).  Uses the best elements of past Waters atrocities (especially the underrated Polyester) and plenty of new surprises.  Made me sick, in a wonderful way. Thanks, John! ","genre":null},{"date":"27 September 1998","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Absolutely hilarious.

The story is classic, but better yet are both the stunning animation and the inspirational score by Hans Zimmer. The songs are brilliantly written with music by Elton John (with help from Zimmer) and Lyrics by Andrew Lloyd Webber's long-time partner, Tim Rice.

We have Michael Lonsdale from Moonraker ('79), Sean Bean from Goldeneye ('95) and Jonathan Pryce from Tomorrow Never Dies ('97). They all give acceptable performances in the film which was an entertaining piece of film-making in itself.  Also, for me it's always a pleasure seeing actor Jean Reno who played Vincent.

This film moved me tremendously and made me cry.  Jennifer-Jason Leigh, who is not one of my favorite actresses, does an absolutely incredible job of creating this character.  The nuances in the four leading roles are portrayed with such finesse, that it is impossible to say definitively exactly what their motives are. I actually felt as if I were living in upper-class society in the 1870's so well is that time depicted.I highly recommend this film!

The storyline was well written and well acted by the highly skilled cast, and the entire movie seemed very elegant.
