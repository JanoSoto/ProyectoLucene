He fails to imbue this good guy character with any sort of heart or soul.

You hear children saying the pledge of allegiance in comically childish voices while empty courtrooms and hallways dissolve by, and it seems good, but then the music starts. Either the director should have fired the score composer, or the director should have been fired for allowing that score. It was an intensely 80s (even though this was made in 1979) soft-jazz that, at first, made me worried that this movie would be an entirely lighter movie than it detailed on the back, and then later just didn't fit the movie at all. It was also bad music in the first place, which made it rather annoying.Furthermore, this was shot in that 70s\/80s color that makes everything look soft, except the filmmakers were obviously trying for a hard, gritty look at times. I don't know much about what type of film-stock was available at the time, but considering I've seen quite a few movies from the time period that were capable of really taking over that soft, fuzzy look and either using it well or reversing it completely, it shows that maybe the cinematographer wasn't exactly at the top of his game at the time. That said, some rather great, albeit obvious, shots were used to pretty good effect from time to time. I think what gets me about this movie is that the usual bland imagery made the really good shots seem too blatantly symbolically obvious, almost like you wanted to say to the cinematographer, Yeah yeah yeah, I see, bars fall across his face, and this movie is about Justice. Woo. I guess I don't really even need to say that this movie is about justice, considering that justice is in the title, everything the characters talk about is justice, it's set in the judicial system about a man named Arthur (Pacino) as a lawyer, yadayadayada. What's interesting about the writing, though, is that it does two major things 1) It tries to paint a tragic, dark picture of the judicial system via a series of mistrials, corrupt officials, mistaken identities, and about every court-screw up you can possibly think of, and 2) It simultaneously tries to be a surreal dark-humor piece, something kind of Gilliam-esquire.Now considering the bad choice of music and the bad choice of cinematography, I wonder seriously if the direction really fit the writing. However, I can't really be sure, because the writing is so incredibly random. The crazy surreality thrown in amongst the gritty realism really confuses the viewer and makes the movie a bit unclear about what it was really trying to do.Now two explanations come to mind about this. The first is that the direction just simply didn't fit the writing and thus resulted in an odd combination conceits. The second is that the director saw the writing was really impenetrable in said way, and thus did his best to make it work. Two writers worked on the script. Maybe the second one was called in because the director wanted a different tone to the movie, or maybe the two writers just had such different outlooks on what they're doing, the director tried to include both. In one instance, the director is bad, in another, he's really commendable for at least making it work. I don't really know what to think about it.That said, it isn't like this movie is entirely bad. The acting is incredible. The story is very engaging at the least and really takes the time to knock the audience across the head a few times. Al Pacino was nominated for an Oscar for this role, and I don't know exactly what he lost it to, but if he had won it, it would have been well deserved.It is a good enough movie that I actually would have no qualms about including it in my DVD collection, and because of the sort of oddness of exposition, it's hard not to want to watch the movie again just to have some idea of what to expect.--PolarisDiB ","genre":null},{"date":"17 September 2005","score":"","review":" Initially it doesn't start out very well.

We need a mainstream film... so lets not make it too smart for people to follow and too deep for people to want to get into. We don't wanna go over people's heads. It takes a truly original character and plugs him into a movie as routine and unremarkable as the bullying, red-neck catalysts who flaunt 85% of the film's supporting roles.

Sorry, I forgot. Jeremy is bullied all throughout the movie and takes way too long to retaliate. As if the director is getting too damn into this or has time to kill. Even when it's clear there's no other choice. Not much fight in you, huh? asks one of them at one point. Obviously not.I can't tell if we takes so long to just use his abilities because he's afraid, he's too good... or the film's gotta too much time to kill and the director's enjoying lashing back.We see Jeremy's pale as death skin and his defined male form. Salva incorporates this scene because of his preference for the male physique. He shows male nudity in a lot of his movies and homosexual elements. There is a moment that suggests that Jeremy might be gay or some of the other kids in the film might have those elements as well. These scenes are well-drawn, no doubt related to Salva's experiences dealing with his own sexuality. Salva himself is gay, yes.Which explains a lot of the endless elaborate homo put-downs throughout the movie and male nudity as well. Even the southern redneck kids don't mind too much getting a gander at Powder's privates. Of course we need (yes, NEED) scenes where Jeremy is persecuted for the way he is. But there are too many of those. They take up way too much of the movie. A scene in a cafeteria, in the woods and in the gymnasium that moves outside onto the field. There are many, many scenes where Jeremy shows his endless powers. Yet too many people are slow to catch on, even the smart ones. There's a truly great scene where a redneck hick deputy sheriff (Brandon Smith) shoots a deer and Powder uses an empathy power so the deputy can feel the deer's pain and suffering.And another where Jeremy is getting involved with the only sweet girl in town and they have a moment where they share kind of Vulcan mind-meld.

So does pretty much everyone else in this film most of the time.I asked myself, why?Oh, the formula.

He delivers eloquence about where he explains what Powder is and again later with everything wrong with humanity and how we haven't moved very far in the great human race. And Jeremy could be humanity's answer. The ending is inevitable, but sad. I guess there was just no other way for Powder or the movie. But you walk away wishing Powder AND the movie itself just did more than have big moments involving special effects, dealing with antagonists and only occasionally having a real moment.

When it first came out (so to speak) it seemed so bright and fresh and funny and original -- and now it just seems so, well, lame.As one of the first mainstream films to deal with homosexual themes and become a box office success in the process, IN & OUT was blessed with its uniqueness. It was good-natured, well-intentioned, non-threatening and seemingly politically correct, yet old-fashioned in a Capraesque sort of way. What's not to like? But as gay slowly, but assuredly, became mainstream, sissy stereotyping of gay characters, while certainly still with us, ceased to be the only option for discriminating moviegoers. Thus, there is a backlash; it even became a point of contention in another gay movie. In ALL OVER THE GUY, one gay man saw it as an amusing comedy romp, while his blind date saw it as a homophobic insult.

Stereotypes were mocked by the very people who were demeaned by them and in the process the insult was possibly neutralized. In theory, for instance, having a gay man suggesting that a fondness for Barbra Streisand is a sign of homosexuality should somehow show just how ridiculous such an assumption is. And that might be true, if done once. But resorting to the Streisand joke again, and again, and again, and again, doesn't negate the stereotype, but confirms it, again and again and again.Mirroring, very loosely, Tom Hanks' very public outing of his high school drama teacher at the 1993 Oscars, the film gives us Kevin Kline as a mild-mannered, small-town high school teacher whose life -- and impending marital plans -- are thrown into chaos when a former student outs him while accepting an Academy Award. The intended compliment inspires nationwide interest and small-town scrutiny. Problem is that Kline's Howard Brackett denies being gay to everyone, especially his soon-to-be bride (Joan Cusack). This could have made for a semi-serious slice-of-life comedy of social mores, and sometimes it seems to strive for that. But the filmmakers are as ambivalent about the point of their film as Howard is about his sexuality. The film never finds a consistent tone and never really tries to; it is farcical one minute, broadly satirical the next and then desperately bittersweet.The film at first seems to be trying to convince us that, despite all the circumstantial evidence, the persnickety Howard really isn't gay. And Kline seems to be playing the part just that way. Until finally he admits he is gay, but just didn't know it. Huh? It's as if he has been persuaded to turn gay against his will just to fit in with a preconceived image. Plus, his coming out is more like an admission of guilt than a pronouncement of pride, let alone acceptance.The filmmakers seem to want it both ways; to boldly denounce the stereotypes as being unfair and then (nudge-nudge, wink-wink) gleefully snickering in admission that they are all oh-so true. It's pretty much the same message being served up by Will & Grace Queer as Folk and Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and other such pop culture sell outs. It is like confronting the homophobe by first admitting that he is absolutely right about everything. The grain of truth within the stereotype becomes the undisputed universal reality.Even granting the film a benefit of the doubt that its intentions are benign, there is this gnawing sense of hypocrisy. Just before the rousing, if predictable, Macho Man finale, one of Howard's students (Shawn Hatosy) shows his support for his beleaguered teacher by coming out at the high school graduation. What seems to be a remarkable act of moral courage is subverted when, in Spartacus style, everyone in the auditorium also announces I am gay! It is supposed to be a Capraesque moment of gutsy small-town loyalty, but it rings utterly false. And worse, it demeans the young man's brave act, clouding whether his pronouncement is even true or merely a noble gesture. A film about coming out trivializes that very act.Then the film ends with a celebration of the traditional heterosexual wedding, as if to tell the straight audience Don't worry. People like Howard are harmless and no threat to your lifestyle. Again, huh? Howard and his problems seem to blend into the crowd, which may be the point of the story Gay's okay, as long as it doesn't get in the way. Yet, even realizing just how shallow and dishonest the film is, it still manages to be, well, funny, especially in its more ridiculous moments. The mock Academy Awards show and Kline taking a lesson on how to be masculine make the film worth watching. It is what it wants to be, a harmless sitcom with only the vaguest connection with the real world. Cusack's over the top performance is grating, but the rest of the cast is just fine, led nicely by the always charming Kline. And kudos has to go to card-carrying Republican and NRA member Tom Selleck for his wonderful stereotype-busting performance he plays a gay character who is not a gay caricature.

The pieces start to fit in Will's profile of the killer who is murdering families on a lunar cycle, so now it's a race against time to stop him slaughtering another family in the next full moon. One thing that hits you about it straightaway is the strong 80's awe, so it feels really dated, but honestly it didn't disappoint me, as what we get is an intelligent and polished effort by Michael Mann. Don't be expecting whole lot of energy and action, as it's an incredibly slow and realistic set-up, with moody performances and a plot that is a thought provoking mystery piece, which has its grisly moments mixed into many subtle and haunting situations. Gladly it doesn't overplay any of their characters or gimmicks, especially its killer. Anyhow, this prequel is basically overshadowed by Silence of the Lambs which is a good film, but I just don't get the hype that surrounds it. I guess I'm of a small minority when I say I would actually watch this over Silence of the Lambs any day. And there's Hannibal; lets not go there. Also throw in Red Dragon, but I haven't come across it. But, it would be interesting to compare that version to Manhunter. Definitely depressing in tone, with a certain amount of emotional drive that compounds this slick thriller. The plot closely builds on Petersen's characters' torment and how he becomes so close to the killer that he studies; it affects his life and the way he thinks. And no, it isn't a Lecktor film. But when Lecktor and Graham shared the screen, the burning conversation they had was uneasy. Basically the plot concentrates more on Petersen's FBI agent, rather than the serial killer. And, I just found the attention to Graham's determination and effort to capturing the killer rather gripping and incredibly well driven. It's a smart screenplay that closely draws on the victims more than anything. Tension and horror is built up in a slow manner to reach its thumping conclusion. The performances were top-notch, especially that of William Petersen who nails the part of the scarred FBI agent Will Graham with conviction. I thought he was somewhat of an underrated actor. Brian Cox as Hannibal Lecktor was subtly eerie and hardly over-the-top (like Hopkins) in the small amount of scenes he got. Tom Noonan striking features and quiet tone suited the role perfectly as the serial killer called the Tooth fairy. There's also some good supporting roles from the likes of Dennis Farina, Joan Allen and Kim Greist. Mann's direction is remarkably stylish and well executed, he creates some brilliant sequences and that especially goes for smacking and high-octane climax. Cinematography by Dante Spinotti is beautifully set-up with the many angles and well-constructed shots that truly catch your eye and really make you pay notice. The lush visuals and rich colour patterns are incredibly vibrant. With good use of lighting. The Reds groovy electronic score might feel out of place at times, but still it had an enchanting nature and powerful punch. Overall, it's an intelligent and slow grinding film that is directed with flair by Michael Mann.

I'm from Brooklyn so seeing the locals was great, and it has a certain grittiness to it all. I like films that show NYC in the early 70's a lot. But here, almost nothing ever seems to go on.

","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"17 September 2005","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" It's well known now that Fargo, contrary to the titles at the start, isn't based on a true story. It was just a little dig, a little joke at the expense of the 'true story' phenomenon. But at the same time it was a calculated move to get the audience to go with the story, because if the audience is told that something is true they're more likely to allow themselves to be swept up by it and believe in it. And I guess for some people Fargo may seem a little weird (well, to people who have been weaned on blockbusters). Therefore the true story tag was there to help make the plot seem more plausible.But, really, the film didn't need it. The film only seems odd in that the characters speak like real people, with all the broken sentences and 'ums' and 'ahs' (and 'yahs'), and act like real people &#150; some act with nobility, others are completely feckless and some are violent. It also seems unusual because we're used to films where people speak perfectly, think perfectly and act perfectly. So, therefore, most audiences are used to a Hollywood unreality, which is why Fargo was such a breath of fresh air all those years back&#133; What I enjoy most about Fargo is Jerry Lundegaard (played by William H. Macy). He's such an idiot, a real putz ('What the heck d'ya mean?'). Yet despite the fact that he's stupid, and despite the fact that he has his own wife kidnapped for money, I can't help but kind of feel sorry for the guy. And I sort of feel sorry for him because he's human. He's embarrassed when he's asked why he needs the money; he's awkward when he's telling his son that something has happened to his mother; he gets angry when his plans fall through; and he loses his rag when the police finally catch on to him. Yet even then he desperately tries to maintain his dignity. He never reveals his true feelings. ('I answered the darn&#133; I'm co-operating here.') And I also like the fact that he always tries to overcome the new problems that he faces. He never quits. The funniest example is the way that he drives off halfway through a police interview. It kind of reminds me of The Simpsons (the sound of rushing footsteps and then the screeching of tyres). But there's also his final scene where he tries to escape the police by climbing through a window. He's a pathetic guy but at least he seems real.But although Lundegaard is something of a sympathetic character, he's also the most unforgivable. I mean, Steve Buscemi's character and Peter Stormare's character are just plain ruthless. They're greedy, immoral people and that's that. But Lundergaard is a family man with responsibilities and people who are dependant on him. Therefore, although he doesn't kill anyone, his actions are the most heinous.But speaking of Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, they're absolutely fantastic in this film. At first they kind of seem like a buffoonish odd couple, but because you've bought into their weird relationship with its amusing eccentricities (I love the pancake conversation), it makes the violence all the more shocking. These aren't cackling villains or loud-mouthed bad guys; they're the sort of psychopathic people you could meet in a bar or on the street. And as a consequence they're more interesting to watch. I especially like the scene where Buscemi is trying to get Stormare to talk. Even kidnappers need conversation. But I also like the scene with the state trooper.

It was just a little dig, a little joke at the expense of the 'true story' phenomenon. But at the same time it was a calculated move to get the audience to go with the story, because if the audience is told that something is true they're more likely to allow themselves to be swept up by it and believe in it. And I guess for some people Fargo may seem a little weird (well, to people who have been weaned on blockbusters). Therefore the true story tag was there to help make the plot seem more plausible.But, really, the film didn't need it. The film only seems odd in that the characters speak like real people, with all the broken sentences and 'ums' and 'ahs' (and 'yahs'), and act like real people &#150; some act with nobility, others are completely feckless and some are violent. It also seems unusual because we're used to films where people speak perfectly, think perfectly and act perfectly. So, therefore, most audiences are used to a Hollywood unreality, which is why Fargo was such a breath of fresh air all those years back&#133; What I enjoy most about Fargo is Jerry Lundegaard (played by William H. Macy). He's such an idiot, a real putz ('What the heck d'ya mean?'). Yet despite the fact that he's stupid, and despite the fact that he has his own wife kidnapped for money, I can't help but kind of feel sorry for the guy. And I sort of feel sorry for him because he's human. He's embarrassed when he's asked why he needs the money; he's awkward when he's telling his son that something has happened to his mother; he gets angry when his plans fall through; and he loses his rag when the police finally catch on to him. Yet even then he desperately tries to maintain his dignity. He never reveals his true feelings. ('I answered the darn&#133; I'm co-operating here.') And I also like the fact that he always tries to overcome the new problems that he faces. He never quits. The funniest example is the way that he drives off halfway through a police interview. It kind of reminds me of The Simpsons (the sound of rushing footsteps and then the screeching of tyres). But there's also his final scene where he tries to escape the police by climbing through a window. He's a pathetic guy but at least he seems real.But although Lundegaard is something of a sympathetic character, he's also the most unforgivable. I mean, Steve Buscemi's character and Peter Stormare's character are just plain ruthless. They're greedy, immoral people and that's that. But Lundergaard is a family man with responsibilities and people who are dependant on him. Therefore, although he doesn't kill anyone, his actions are the most heinous.But speaking of Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, they're absolutely fantastic in this film. At first they kind of seem like a buffoonish odd couple, but because you've bought into their weird relationship with its amusing eccentricities (I love the pancake conversation), it makes the violence all the more shocking. These aren't cackling villains or loud-mouthed bad guys; they're the sort of psychopathic people you could meet in a bar or on the street. And as a consequence they're more interesting to watch. I especially like the scene where Buscemi is trying to get Stormare to talk. Even kidnappers need conversation. But I also like the scene with the state trooper.

Unfortunately, I disregarded this time-honored rule and watched this movie starring Denzel Washington, John Goodman, and Donald Sutherland. I usually have faith in Denzel to guide me to a decent movie, but he let me down with this one. I haven't yet posted here to completely pan a movie, but I felt a responsibility to warn you about this one.The movie has a relatively intriguing premise and not terrible writing, but it is totally ruined by pretentious, obnoxious direction. I was surprised to see that this director was the same guy who did Primal Fear, but then it all kind of made sense. This movie, like Primal Fear, is very full of its own importance, with edgy camera angles, melodramatic music and over-the-top acting. UNLIKE Primal Fear, the story is not entertaining enough to legitimize this melodrama. Instead you get a plot that is garbled and unintelligible and really doesn't have much to say. It's pretty much the fault of the director, in my opinion.The basic story is that some spirit named Azazil is able to transfer from body to body (we're not really ever told convincingly HOW this happens, or why - sometimes it appears to be at will and then sometimes not). Azazil has no real apparent motivation for wanting to wipe out the human race, except that he is ancient and pretty angry. This can still be entertaining in a scary movie that is directed well. Unfortunately, this is not such a movie. The director spends so much time trying to make the hokey plot seem smart that the story trips all over itself. Large parts of the plot that would be better left in to explain things seem to have been cut out, and events get laughably confusing and stupid. Yet the movie continues with a tone that would make you think the director and all its participants believe they are delivering the most meaningful movie since Citizen Kane. The end result of all the hokeyness is that Denzel Washington gets framed for various crimes. He then spends most of the last half of the movie yelling at Azazil (who we, and Denzel, of course cannot see most of the time, and who jumps rapidly from body to body). The camera angles and styles used to demonstrate Azazil's movement give the viewer a major headache. I stuck through it to see if there would be an interesting ending. There was not. Suffice it to say that John Goodman, when possessed by Azazil, is NOT scary.

FYI.Anyway, this is the kind of little gem you hope for when you go out to see a crime thriller - strong performances, a quirky plot centering around a battle of wits, effective dialog which not only rings true to the ear (with two exceptions, see below), but also successfully mixes menace, humor, and pathos in equal measure. While this is definitely not family fare, and while I can't imagine the Oprah crowd ever enjoying a movie like Suicide Kings, anyone with a taste for suspense, noir or thriller material will find much to enjoy here.The scenario is brilliantly conceived five callow preppie college kids kidnap a semi-retired crime boss. They hope to force his cooperation in rescuing a second kidnap victim (a young woman who is the sister of one of the boys and the lover of another member of the group. Because Walken's character has been semi-legit for many years, the boys get lucky and catch him off guard. Walken's character (Charlie) wakes up duct taped to a chair, with one finger already chopped off (to impress on him the urgency of their situation) and pumped full of pain killers.However, the movie soon makes it clear that the boys have caught a tiger by the tail. Even taped to a chair and physically helpless,Charlie is far tougher, shrewder, and more ruthless than all of his captors put together. Even while slowly bleeding to death, he manages to use his contacts to get the hunt for the young woman under way and turn the members of the group against each other with carefully chosen observations and revelations. The process is fascinating to behold - Charlie can be witty, patronizing, menacing and comforting all in the space of 60 seconds, and you literally fear for these young mens' lives and futures even though they seem to have the upper hand. They aren't street sharks and killers, and Charlie is.Also impressive is Denis Leary, who plays Charlie's chief strong arm and factotum, Lono. Leary's rants and ravings are long, involved, quirky, funny, and highly entertaining. There is a running joke involving Lono's new stingray skin boots that is almost worth the price of admission by itself. Although I never believed Leary's dangerous tough guy image in the movies (he would have gotten his butt kicked at my junior high school), I give him credit. He fairly boils over with restless, angry energy as an actor. This makes his character Lono is a lot of fun to watch. Lono is the kind of guy who gripes about the new graphite shafts of the golf clubs he uses to beat the stuffings out of people, and how much better the old metal shafts were for the task.The movie isn't perfect. The weakest character of the group of kidnappers, Ira is written and played so broadly that at times he is quite annoying. It's obvious he is supposed to be the comic relief of the group, and the actor works hard to invest a thankless character with some depth and humanity. And if this were a pure caper film,I think the character and the performance would have been fine. But Ira is such a whiny schmuck that he saps the movie of some of the energy it has at times. Other people may disagree with me on this one, and I'm not saying he's bad, I'm just saying that he takes things a little too far for this kind of movie.The other weak point is the second pair of kidnappers, Heckle and Jeckyl. The two character actors who play them (including Brad Garrett, most recently known for his part in Everybody Loves Raymond) are obviously old hands at this sort of character, but in the scenes set in their apartment (where they are supposedly holding the girl), they come off as buffoons, sort of like Laurel and Hardy with snub nosed 38s. While they are quite entertaining, it's impossible to take them seriously, and this also detracts from the sense of menace and urgency that is supposed to be driving the situation.Anyway, aside from those minor caveats, I was really, really impressed by this movie. Anyone with a taste for darkly humored, quirky noir films such as Reservoir Dogs and The Usual Suspects will find this a worthy entry in the genre, as long as they can overlook those two sub-par aspects.PS The DVD reissue of Suicide Kings contains two alternate endings which film completists and fanatics will enjoy. The first alternate ending is somewhat sappy and romantic, and doesn't really jibe with the tone of the previous 15 minutes. The second ending is more workable, and has a nice twist.

They aren't street sharks and killers, and Charlie is.Also impressive is Denis Leary, who plays Charlie's chief strong arm and factotum, Lono. Leary's rants and ravings are long, involved, quirky, funny, and highly entertaining. There is a running joke involving Lono's new stingray skin boots that is almost worth the price of admission by itself. Although I never believed Leary's dangerous tough guy image in the movies (he would have gotten his butt kicked at my junior high school), I give him credit. He fairly boils over with restless, angry energy as an actor. This makes his character Lono is a lot of fun to watch. Lono is the kind of guy who gripes about the new graphite shafts of the golf clubs he uses to beat the stuffings out of people, and how much better the old metal shafts were for the task.The movie isn't perfect. The weakest character of the group of kidnappers, Ira is written and played so broadly that at times he is quite annoying. It's obvious he is supposed to be the comic relief of the group, and the actor works hard to invest a thankless character with some depth and humanity. And if this were a pure caper film,I think the character and the performance would have been fine. But Ira is such a whiny schmuck that he saps the movie of some of the energy it has at times. Other people may disagree with me on this one, and I'm not saying he's bad, I'm just saying that he takes things a little too far for this kind of movie.The other weak point is the second pair of kidnappers, Heckle and Jeckyl. The two character actors who play them (including Brad Garrett, most recently known for his part in Everybody Loves Raymond) are obviously old hands at this sort of character, but in the scenes set in their apartment (where they are supposedly holding the girl), they come off as buffoons, sort of like Laurel and Hardy with snub nosed 38s. While they are quite entertaining, it's impossible to take them seriously, and this also detracts from the sense of menace and urgency that is supposed to be driving the situation.Anyway, aside from those minor caveats, I was really, really impressed by this movie. Anyone with a taste for darkly humored, quirky noir films such as Reservoir Dogs and The Usual Suspects will find this a worthy entry in the genre, as long as they can overlook those two sub-par aspects.PS The DVD reissue of Suicide Kings contains two alternate endings which film completists and fanatics will enjoy. The first alternate ending is somewhat sappy and romantic, and doesn't really jibe with the tone of the previous 15 minutes. The second ending is more workable, and has a nice twist. IMO, I think that the grimmer ending they kept was ultimately the most satisfying way to end the film. You may disagree.

I had never seen any of Douglas Sirk's movies up til today, and boy, was All That Heaven Allows a great introduction! The film follows the romance of Cary (played by Jane Wyman) and Ron (Rock Hudson). Cary is a well-off widower who somehow falls in love with her gardener much to her surprise. The problem that she has to overcome of course, is What Will The Neighbors Think? Yes, boys and girls, we have the classic 50's scandal. An older woman being with a younger man!! OK, let it be known that I LOVED this movie. Jane Wyman is fantastic here, and Rock Hudson? Well, what can I say? I can fully understand why he was considered a hug heartthrob in his day. Sure the plot is totally overblown and melodramatic, but I don't care, because Wyman and Hudson make it work so well, and have so much chemistry together.It's so easy to watch this film and see how much Sirk influenced other directors, even though he was quite ridiculed for the same influences, his camera work, and especially his lighting choices you can see in a myriad of other movies since (see of course, the ultimate salute to him, Far From Heaven as an excellent example).A simply fantastic piece of film-making here!

Usual explanation is that the storyline and characters were by far more interesting. Well, I don't agree. Although I also have very fond memories of the original Star Wars-movie (and it's sequels) since it was my very first non-cartoonish feature I saw in theater (twice) at age 10, I already back then realized that these movies aren't by any significant margin above cartoon-level anyhow. Awesome, epoch making, brilliantly entertaining scifi with great special effects surely. So throughout the 1990's after I first heard that George Lucas was planning those brand new episodes, becoming possible by revolutionary CGI-technology, I knew there was something spectacular on its way. And I wasn't disappointed. To my money, now having seen them all, Episode I - The Phantom Menace is The Best of the whole series Special FX leave nothing to desire, just as one assumed; action-scenes and overall pace are beautifully orchestrated; Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are among my very favorite actors and their line delivery is always ear-pleasing, no matter what they say; and it all climaxes in the greatest sword-fight ever, laser or not, in movie history. Granted, there are long speeches and meetings couple too many, the podrace-scene is a tad too long also, and obligatory funny black character Jar Jar Binks is VERY unfunny, but those are minor flaws. Especially compared to myriad of shortcomings found in former episodes, particularly in Return Of The Jedi, the only actual black sheep of the whole saga. Once and for all, it's mind blowing effects that have always defined these movies for me, other aspects come distant second.

You can see she was allowed to play this character as she felt, and with heart. Anders Berthelsen, who plays Kresten, really absorbs the character, becoming this man who has survived the farm and made it to the top of monetary success, but finds love in the land and in Liva, as well as his brother Rud. Rud, played by Jesper Asholt, has to be the secret genius of this film. Every moment of every shot he is the gentle loving giant child. One actor who is going to be a huge success is Emil Tarding, who plays Liva's little brother Bjarke. What a smart clever funny young man. They all shine because of the writing, first and foremost, and because of the Dogma rules, second. Dogma is a revolution, pure, true, allowing movement and flow, like a mountain river in comparison to a polluted ditch, making it hard to watch our American 100 million dollar movies with any respect. Mifune is personal. It is obvious there was a small crew. One gaffer for example, so that it's as if you are there, the only one, inside the story, watching like a fly on the wall, enjoying the struggle through the confusion of life, as everyone. A massive crew of hundreds disturbs the acting, disturbs the vibe, becomes the movie, rather then the film being the focus. Somehow these larger and larger films just become money vampires for people to fill their bank accounts, rather then go to make something beautiful, as this. Anyway, one can see in watching this film how a movie should really feel. You can understand that the actors felt comfortable and the whole thing came very naturally for them, rather then forced. One can immediately understand that the director Soren K. Jacobson was excited and felt the artist, allowing himself the opportunity to touch base with why we make films in the first place, art. When I get sick of Hollywood films (every other day) I watch Mifune and feel refreshed and I believe in the poetry of film once again. I can believe that a simple story is capable of being entertainment and moving, rather then great big complicated stories that consume the characters, and miss the mark.

The effects were just awesome and one of the coolest scenes for me is when The future Van Damme confronts his wife it was rather tense and very moving, plus Ron Silver is extremely menacing as the main villain!. I thought Van Damme's acting was fantastic, and he and Mia Sara had amazing chemistry together, plus the opening is quite disturbing and very memorable. It's quite original and it had a fantastic all around cast, plus it's exciting throughout!. The finale is one of the best ever and, i thought the ending was really neat and quite emotional, plus It had some great fight scenes as well!. It's one of Van Damme's best performances, and i thought it was extremely well written and made as well, plus i can't believe this only has a 5.5 rating as it should be much much higher in my opinion!.It really is a brilliant film, and i just loved the whole concept of time traveling!, plus it's very imaginative and creative as well!. All the characters are very likable, and i really hope they make a true sequel to this with both Van Damme and Mia Sara back together!, plus it has quite a few shocking and disturbing scenes as well. Van Damme once again has a cool look,and i thought the scene where Van Damme visits Sarah Fielding in the hospital, was really moving and tense, plus the locations were also awesome!.There were also quite a few harsh jokes throwin' at Van Damme and he took them extremely well This is one of the best Action\/Sc-Fi films ever made in my opinion with a kick ass story and 2 amazing performances from Van Damme and Mia Sara, and if you haven't seen it do so immediately!, you won't regret it's one of Van Damme's absolute best!.The Direction is amazing!.Peter Hyams does an amazing job here with wonderful camera work, fantastic angles, some great close up shots, great use of colors and he kept the film at an extremely fast pace!.There is a little bit of blood and violence.

Jean Claude Van Damme is AMAZING as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, fantastic in the acting department, had amazing chemistry with Mia Sara, gives one of his best performances, had tons of charisma, had a lot of character, and just did an amazing job overall!.

Ron Silver is wonderful as the evil Senator McComb, he had some awesome one liners, had some great scenes with Van Damme, was extremely menacing and just did a wonderful job overall!. (Silver Rules). Bruce McGill is great in his role, he was very likable and did a great job i liked him lots. Gloria Reuben is hot, and did excellent with what she had to do, although i wished she had more screen time.

I saw this movie when it first came out and I was instantly hooked on it. I laughed very hard when I watched it on the big screen (by the way, I was twelve years old when this film was theatrically released). Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are terrific as the two lead characters. The rest of the cast also really glows. This film will probably still be a favorite with me even when I am past the age of fifty.The film is about two best friends who are unable to keep sensible, steady jobs while hoping to eventually start their own business. Lloyd was working as a limousine driver when he met a gorgeous woman named Mary Swanson. He proceeded to drive her to the airport when he fell madly in love with her. She leaves her briefcase in the airport terminal and Lloyd immediately rushed to get it back to her. He was too late and lost his job following his fall from the jet-way. Harry was also terminated after he failed to deliver dogs to the proper pet show on time. After much deliberation, Harry and Lloyd decide to take a road trip across America. Their destination Aspen, Colorado. Lloyd wants to be reunited with Mary so that he can start a relationship with her, in addition to returning her the briefcase she left behind. Little do the boys know that they are being pursued by a couple of criminals who are after the money that is being kept inside the locked briefcase; they were sent on the mission by Nicholas Andre, a man who is linked somehow to Mary and her family.I have several favorite sequences from this hysterical picture. One is where Harry and Lloyd encounter trouble at a truck-stop diner. A truck driver named Sea Bass is accidentally hit with a salt-shaker from Harry. Sea Bass is irritated and spits on Harry's hamburger. Lloyd decides to seek revenge on Sea Bass and his gang by telling the staff that they are willing to pay for the service that he and Harry received at the restaurant. By the way, the waitress that they talk to is a very cute young woman with black hair. She also seems to be very sweet. They get away with this scheme while the overly tough Sea Bass is left feeling tremendous amounts of anger. I also like it when the duo puts atomic hot peppers on Joe's burger and makes him sick; he has an ulcer and cannot have such edibles. Joe groans and gives a request for his medicine; Harry unknowingly gives Joe rat poison, which instantly kills him. I also liked it when Harry drank the tea containing the Turbo Lax; this made him have to go very bad as his bowels were getting ready to pop.I love this movie! Dumb & Dumber will forever remain to be one of my favorite films. There are so many moments in this movie that are exceedingly hilarious. I recommend this title for anyone who loves to laugh.
