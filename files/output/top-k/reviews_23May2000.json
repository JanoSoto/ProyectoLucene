These are two movies that came along and were bold enough to try something different. Those films  included raunchy jokes, crude humour, nudity and they had the audacity to poke fun at everyone, call them the Quentin Tarantino of comedies.  Before American Pie, you had some ALMOST good films with Can't Hardly Wait and 10 Things I Hate About You.  They were good but not quite good enough to be mentioned in the same breath as Animal House and Porky's and such.  Then American Pie comes along and shows everyone that it is okay to have boobs again and to use the f-word liberally with lines like  Sherman, what the f*** are you doing here? and  Oz, F***face, I don't think he's coming back!  This was a film that didn't try to imitate closely the way teens and young adults talk, it DID imitate the way teens and young adults talk.  Road Trip continues that trend.  Hollywood has to realize when it gives the green light to scripts that we are not as stupid as they think we are, in most cases.  And what I mean by that is simply, sure, it can make money off almost any excuse for a teen film like Drive Me Crazy and Here On Earth and such, but if you want to hit the jackpot, if you want young people to feel the need to see the film more than once and recommend it to their friends, you have to have a smart ear, likable characters to laugh at and more than just a simple boy meets girl story.  Road Trip is that movie!When I went into the film, I was shocked but pleasantly so, to see Ivan Reitman and Dan Goldberg's name attached to the film as executive producers.  These are guys that have brought us films like Animal House, Ghostbusters, Meatballs, Stripes and even something like Kindergarten Cop.  These are all funny films with a great ear for dialogue.  So it immediately starts off on the right foot.The next thing it did right is the casting of Tom Greene and Sean William Scott.  Greene is quite sick and twisted by nature and Sean William Scott stole every scene in American Pie.  So to include them in your cast as the raunchiest guys of the bunch is great casting.  The next thing the film does right is it goes back to the roots of campus comedy and it has plenty of nudity.  Yes, sure this may sound sexist and primitive but it also sells tickets.  And they can actually make a case for having it because the story is being told by Greene's character so, as he puts it,  it is my story, there can be lots of nudity if I want there to be. Road Trip has plenty of beautiful women, crude jokes, a nerd that discovers who he is, annebriation, drugs, mean sprited jokes and a script that is more convoluted and conventionally funny than any film save American Pie.  Nothing is sacred here.  That includes the blind, obesity, women, animals and of course nerds.  This is a fun film and although I am sure that it is garnered more towards males, if you can go in with an open mind anyone can enjoy it.  I will bet that this film will go on to gross about 70 or 80 million dollars and I hope that more films are made in this kind of tradition.  We need more films inspired by Animal House.  We need more characters that are take-offs of John Belushi and Tom Greene.  Maybe Ivan Reitman will have another script like this one on his shelf somewhere and he is ready to dust that one off as well.  Maybe.

Yes, The Limey resembles nothing so much as Hiroshima, mon amour &#150; as Don Siegel would have seen it. (Or maybe it's the other way around; Resnais reworking Magnum Force). Editor Sarah Flack and Soderbergh have constructed The Limey as a French New Wave film (Left Bank, that is), starting with the exhilarating introductory shots of Wilson on the plane\/with Ed in the car\/alone, etc. &#150; like Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter with its slightly disorienting aeroplane scenes. Obviously, Soderbergh walks in the paths of several mainstream Hollywood directors who have tried to make an `American Nouvelle Vague' film, including Scorsese, Coppola, Allen, and more importantly here, Dennis Hopper.Of course, Easy Rider is what Soderbergh wants us to remember when we see Peter Fonda's tanned Californian face. The casting is at the centre of most texts on The Limey &#150; rightfully so. Casting Fonda as a vain music producer (who cashes in on 60s nostalgia) with a perfect smile, and Terence Stamp as a Cockney hard-man, seems a stroke of genius. It adds to the feeling that The Limey is an echo, an echo of Easy Rider and Resnais, but also of Ken Loach's Poor Cow, scenes from which appear in The Limey as flashbacks into Wilson's memory. The revenge motive is continually frustrated, as if Soderbergh is playing with audience anticipation. Like in Boorman's 1967 masterpiece Point Blank (another echo), Wilson is a haunting angel, a walking anachronism who belongs neither in sun-drenched L.A. nor in contemporary London.There is plenty of material in The Limey to discuss endlessly in cinephile circles (as for instance, why is Luis Guzmán's Ed wearing first a Mao, then a Che Guevara T-shirt?), but suffice to say for now that it is an absolutely brilliant, fascinating piece of cinema.

The charm of the characters and the simplicity of the story made it a film that could not only be enjoyed by children but by adults too. This is where Antz comes in. While Toy Story only existed on the one level that could be enjoyed by all, Antz exists on two levels, one level that can be enjoyed by children, aswell as a completely different level that can be enjoyed by adults. While only one of these levels may be universally transcendent, it does not take away from the overall enjoyment of this film.On the first level is a simple story. Hitchcockian simplicity placing an ordinary character in an extraordinary situation, sees ordinary Ant worker Z foiling General Mandible's evil plans to take over the ant colony and getting the girl, Princess Bala. On a more adult level are the subtle movie references that range from the dance sequence inspired by Pulp Fiction, to the war sequence inspired by both Starship Troopers and The Killing Fields. Perhaps the best way to read this movie, however, is as a self referential gag fest about Woody Allen. As it is Allen who voices the main character Z, one can only assume that he knows that his character Z is an utter send up of his on and off screen persona. Any opening scene that borrows from Manhattan but is actually a decent from silhouetted grass stems into a psychiatrists room, where Z is telling his psychiatrist of how he feels inadequate and a nobody is totally sublime. The fact that the reply from the psychiatrist that he is a nobody also makes you wonder if this is more than just a cartoon and more of a social commentary on communism and capitalism. By the end of the film we realise that the capitalist ideal has won over the communist ideal first seen in the opening sequence where every ant knows its place and is working for the colony. This contrast between capitalism and communism continues as a motif throughout the film.Rarely does a film contain all the elements that one desires on a film but Antz is different, combining the politics of war, the cross class love affair, the down and out looking for inspiration and a reason to carry on and most importantly, a story about humanity and the human condition. Beneath the surface of Antz lies the struggle of an ordinary Ant who wants something more and fights, albeit quite humorously, for his place and fights to be a better ant (read person). One touching scene has Z and his new friend Barbados meeting for a final time after the battle. Barbados, now being only a head, asks Z how bad it is. Touching and charming this is what the film is all about.Another welcome idea in the film is the casting of two former A-list stars who have 0more or less become B-list stars, in the form of Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone. Both give underestimated performances as Z's buddy Weaver and Princess Bala respectively. Gene Hackman mirrors his tights and ruthless performance in Crimson Tide as General Mandabal and Christopher Walken is also at his usual best as Cutter. It is however Woody Allen who makes this film his own. The send up of himself as the neurotic ant who is trying to find a better place and a better life until he realises that he already has it has a knowing warmth and charm to it. Comparisons with Toy Story, A Bugs Life and even Toy Story 2 will always detract from just how good a film this is and in fact is probably the only criticism one can find with the film.

The charm of the characters and the simplicity of the story made it a film that could not only be enjoyed by children but by adults too. This is where Antz comes in. While Toy Story only existed on the one level that could be enjoyed by all, Antz exists on two levels, one level that can be enjoyed by children, aswell as a completely different level that can be enjoyed by adults. While only one of these levels may be universally transcendent, it does not take away from the overall enjoyment of this film.On the first level is a simple story. Hitchcockian simplicity placing an ordinary character in an extraordinary situation, sees ordinary Ant worker Z foiling General Mandible's evil plans to take over the ant colony and getting the girl, Princess Bala. On a more adult level are the subtle movie references that range from the dance sequence inspired by Pulp Fiction, to the war sequence inspired by both Starship Troopers and The Killing Fields. Perhaps the best way to read this movie, however, is as a self referential gag fest about Woody Allen. As it is Allen who voices the main character Z, one can only assume that he knows that his character Z is an utter send up of his on and off screen persona. Any opening scene that borrows from Manhattan but is actually a decent from silhouetted grass stems into a psychiatrists room, where Z is telling his psychiatrist of how he feels inadequate and a nobody is totally sublime. The fact that the reply from the psychiatrist that he is a nobody also makes you wonder if this is more than just a cartoon and more of a social commentary on communism and capitalism. By the end of the film we realise that the capitalist ideal has won over the communist ideal first seen in the opening sequence where every ant knows its place and is working for the colony. This contrast between capitalism and communism continues as a motif throughout the film.Rarely does a film contain all the elements that one desires on a film but Antz is different, combining the politics of war, the cross class love affair, the down and out looking for inspiration and a reason to carry on and most importantly, a story about humanity and the human condition. Beneath the surface of Antz lies the struggle of an ordinary Ant who wants something more and fights, albeit quite humorously, for his place and fights to be a better ant (read person). One touching scene has Z and his new friend Barbados meeting for a final time after the battle. Barbados, now being only a head, asks Z how bad it is. Touching and charming this is what the film is all about.Another welcome idea in the film is the casting of two former A-list stars who have 0more or less become B-list stars, in the form of Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone. Both give underestimated performances as Z's buddy Weaver and Princess Bala respectively. Gene Hackman mirrors his tights and ruthless performance in Crimson Tide as General Mandabal and Christopher Walken is also at his usual best as Cutter. It is however Woody Allen who makes this film his own. The send up of himself as the neurotic ant who is trying to find a better place and a better life until he realises that he already has it has a knowing warmth and charm to it. Comparisons with Toy Story, A Bugs Life and even Toy Story 2 will always detract from just how good a film this is and in fact is probably the only criticism one can find with the film.

I had gone with my friend on the first day of spring break, and was expecting a good movie, one that would entertain us for the three hours-plus length that it is, but it gave me a new way to look at things.  When we came out of the theater, I looked up just to see if there were any of what the final act entails, coming down on us.  I knew that they were not going to be there but still, I looked all because of a movie. Not many films can do that to me.  I sort of think of myself as one who is schooled in the art of film, I know that I know a lot, but this film was not like what I had seen before. Sure, it had things that happen in other films, like the estranged son coming to his father's deathbed, and the child genius and the loser, but this just put all of these people in a film that treated them like heroes, even if they had not something heroic, or maybe something far from. Paul Thomas Anderson has to be one of the most talented writer\/director of this time.  I had seen Boogie Nights before I saw Hard Eight, or Sydney, where it is sometimes billed as, and it was highly original and very funny. The acting in it was just great and it was a film that loved its actors. If you see, almost every shot of that film has a closeup of someone.  Anyway, this film hinted the originality that was Paul Anderson.  When I saw Hard Eight, I thought that this was a film that should of gotten more recognition than it deserved.  This showed that P.

Rob's talking into the camera to explain his miserable life could have been very annoying (such as Christian Slater in the horrendous Kuffs), but it isn't. Rather, it adds both to the intimacy and the brisk pace of the film. Plus, it makes  it easier to fit in Hornby gems into the dialogue, like Rob's declaration of his credo `Barry and Dick and I agreed a long time ago that what's important is what you like, not what you are like.'

It is truly sickening in places, and there's a great oppressive feeling of suspense and wonder the first time you watch it. The visuals are impressive, well they are when I watch it on digital TV, the concept is interesting, and there are some great moments, like the visions that the cast members get flashed with. And it is very well acted in places, especially by Fishburne and Niell, the two primary characters.The only criticism I have is for the ending, which seems to just sort of tail off, and doesn't befit the film.

What can I say? I had never heard of the guy who plays the Pest in this movie, but it is clear that this flick was supposed to launch his career into the stellar skies, similar to the effect 'Ace Venture Pet Detective' had on Jim Carrey.The story, for what it's worth, is simple. The Pest owes the scottish mafia (yes, the scottish mafia, complete with token kilts and hats on) $50.000, so he agrees to let some nazis (yes, some nazis) pay him $50.000 to try and kill him within 24 hours. As plots go, that's not the worst I've come across. Not the best, either, but it's not a total cliche. So far, so good.So, off we go, into a movie where the plot and the characters are completely secondary to scenes whos only merit is giving The Pest an opportunity to dress up as some hideous stereotype. Not one major ethnic group is left unscathed by The Pest's 'subtle-as-a-world-war' protrayals of them. These ingenious protrayals involve the Pest, dressed up to look like, say, a jewish rabbi, and acting like the Pest saying things like 'meshugginger'. The acting skills involved are not huge.When he is dressed as himself, he simply tries to steal the show by making mildly funny faces, saying extremely moronic things, grinning all the time and dancing for no reason. Sounds fun? Well, it isn't.OK. I have stated earlier that the plot isn't too shabby. So, we can bear with the all-overpowering, talentless antics of The Pest, can't we? Well, no, but even if we could I'm not sure you'd want to. What happens in the actual movie is about as puerile as it gets.Someone has told the script writer that the basic, human emotions are what makes a script great. This is true, but the writer seems to have misunderstood this and built the entire script around basic, human functions instead. In a harrowing 5-minute sequence, for instance, the 'laughs' involve farting in the forest, using a sock to wipe with, nazis sniffing said sock, overblown homosexual innuendo, vomiting in the face and finally bird doo on the face. This is of course all swamped in The Pest saying stupid things and acting stupidly.The bad guys, mainly the nazis, are of course also mindblowingly stupid, and the Pest is never really threatened by them. In the bleak moment near the end where it seems the bad guys have won, I was in fact relieved by the hope that I wouldn't see the Pest again. No such luck, of course.A good example of bad guy stupidity coupled with The Pest's pointless and irritating behaviour is found in the scene, where the Pest delivers chinese food to the bad guys. He walks in, observed by the bad guys, and immediately starts riding around the living room on an antique hellebarde wearing an antique helmet. Thus diverting attention from himself, he starts stealing stuff right under the nose of main nazi, who doesn't notice anything. Ah yes, how believable.The script supervisor also seems to have read through the script and saying No, no, there is a 2 minute window in the film where somebody's groin is not in the action or dialogue. Change that, so that The Pest's groin bursts into flames and he takes all his clothes off.This is a bad film. It tries to spoof itself by having the nazis laugh maniacally for about four hours (please let it be a spoof) but you just can't do it with such lousy base material. It diverts into momentary surrealism a la Zuckerman films once in a while, but it's pointless every time, so you just ignore it and chalk it up to The Pest acting so stupidly, that the natural laws of science have switched this turkey of a movie of the TV and gone to bed.
