Emerson is an un-elected president, elevated to the presidency when his predecessor died in office and he is having a difficult run in the primaries.  His party is caught in a blizzard and is forced to take shelter in a roadside diner.  Shortly after his arrival, he learns from a television news report that Iraq has invaded Kuwait and the army is on its way to Saudi Arabia in a repeat of the 1991 Gulf War Crisis.Emerson turns the diner into a mobile situation room and assesses the strategic implications.  He is informed that the confidence is high that Iraq has mobile chemical and biological weapons that can be deployed in the next 90 minutes.  To further complicate matters, U.S. forces have been drawn so far down and are so scattered that they can't mount any meaningful response for weeks.  President Emerson makes an executive decision and after obtaining a live feed, goes on television to announce that if the Republican Guard does not retreat, he will order a nuclear strike on Baghdad in one hour and 20 minutes.Iraq refuses to negotiate with Emerson because he is Jewish.  They then announce that they have more than 20 long-range nuclear weapons that they will launch on cities worldwide like New York, Paris and Tokyo if the B2 bomber enters their airspace.  They also have one targeted at NORAD, which is 40 miles from the president's current location.  This is the setup in this taut international thriller where two intractable leaders stare over the abyss waiting for the other to blink.   This is an excellent story that makes nuclear confrontation seem all too plausible in the post cold war era.  Though there are many flaws, the basic concept is sound and frightening, and the nail biting suspense is absorbing and extremely well done.  The likelihood of this scenario can be debated, but there are certain areas where the film comes up short.The film was produced on a shoestring (less than $1M) and it showed.  It had the feel of a TV movie.  The camera work was mediocre at best with numerous shots poorly framed. The camera operator often had trouble following the movement of actors.  The news reports were also unrealistic. One plot element was inconceivable.  The entire idea that the five citizens in the diner would be allowed to stay and witness the president's decision making process during a national security crisis is ludicrous.  That would be like inviting people from the White House tour into the Oval Office during such an event.  Some arrangement would be made to sequester these people.  They would have been locked in the kitchen or told to sit in their cars until the crisis abated.The acting of the major players was very good.  Kevin Pollack gave one of his best performances to date as the president without a mandate.  He was strong, tough and resolute and took complete command of the situation.  Timothy Hutton was also excellent as the chief of staff, always buzzing around the president giving him new angles to consider and often overstepping his authority.  Sheryl Lee Ralph gave a strong performance as the president's national security advisor and was strident and insistent about her opinion, which was in direct opposition to the president's decision.Despite its shortcomings, this film presented a tense and engrossing story that was within the realm of possibility, making it that much more interesting and terrifying.

There are three things that make the movie enduring.  First, the complex nature of the title character.  Second, the amazing technical innovations that changed the face of cinema.  Third, the ability to make people from generation to generation give nothing but admiration for this classic.Citizen Kane was not the first choice for Orson Welles.  He originally planned to do a film adaptation of Joesph Conrad's Heart of Darkness that ended up falling through.  Before this film, Welles was known for his infamous broadcast of The War of the Worlds.  Orson Welles is one of the few artists to succeed in everly level of visual art and communications.  He was heavly influenced by John Ford which helped him in making Citizen Kane. Because of his anti Hollywood atittude, Welles like a few others would be beloved by members of the French New Wave during the late 1950's.The film is slightly based on the career of William Randolph Hearst, although some portrayal of the older Kane seems to be based on Joe Kennedy, JFK's father.  Its about a man who goes from being an idealistic crusader to a bitter and corrupt old man.  An amazing fact is that Welles had absolute control in making Citizen Kane(a rarity then as in now).  The film's expressionistic look with the use of shadows and weird angles helped begin the era of Film Noir.  It was both Citizen Kane and The Maltese Falcon(done by first timers John Huston & Orson Welles) that helped create one of the greatest periods in movie history.The film begins with Kane's death as the story looks back at his life.  A reporter is assigned to discover the meaning of Kane's last word.  The first flashback shows Kane as a young boy and the event that would have an effect on him for the rest of his life.  It goes from his time with his caretaker to inheriting a fortune to opening a newspaper company.  The second flashback looks at the early and idealistic period of Charles Foster Kane.The fourth flashback focuses on Charles Foster Kane's first marriage, his political ambition\/disgrace, and his failed marriage.  This flashback also reveals the affair that ruined his political career and first marriage. The next flashback shows his second marriage with Susan Alexander as well as her opera career, firing of Jed Leland, and the construction of Xanadu.  The film climaxes with Kane's loniness and yearning to return to his days of innocence.  The reporter comes to the conclusion that there is no conclusion to the meaning of Charles Foster Kane.There are four remarkable sequences in Citizen Kane.  One, the opening scene.  Two, the passage of time scene where the distance between Charles Kane and his wife widen.  Three, the opera scenes with Susan Alexander. Four, the closing scene.Citizen Kane was co-written by Herman J. Mankiewich and Orson Welles.  The direction helps carry the story along.  William Randolph Hearst hatred the film and tried to have it destroyed.  It didn't help that Hollywood resented Welles for being a genius and an upstart.  Citizen Kane(1941) and The Trial(1963) were the only films in which Orson Welles had complete artistic control.Citizen Kane is a great film that was cheated out of many Oscars including Best Picture.  The director had used the John Ford\/John Wayne vehicle Stagecoach(1939) as an inspiration for his feature debut.  In fact, Welles had watched Stagecoach about forty times during the making of the film. The cast and crew were members of Welle's Mercury Theatre.

There are three things that make the movie enduring.  First, the complex nature of the title character.  Second, the amazing technical innovations that changed the face of cinema.  Third, the ability to make people from generation to generation give nothing but admiration for this classic.Citizen Kane was not the first choice for Orson Welles.  He originally planned to do a film adaptation of Joesph Conrad's Heart of Darkness that ended up falling through.  Before this film, Welles was known for his infamous broadcast of The War of the Worlds.  Orson Welles is one of the few artists to succeed in everly level of visual art and communications.  He was heavly influenced by John Ford which helped him in making Citizen Kane. Because of his anti Hollywood atittude, Welles like a few others would be beloved by members of the French New Wave during the late 1950's.The film is slightly based on the career of William Randolph Hearst, although some portrayal of the older Kane seems to be based on Joe Kennedy, JFK's father.  Its about a man who goes from being an idealistic crusader to a bitter and corrupt old man.  An amazing fact is that Welles had absolute control in making Citizen Kane(a rarity then as in now).  The film's expressionistic look with the use of shadows and weird angles helped begin the era of Film Noir.  It was both Citizen Kane and The Maltese Falcon(done by first timers John Huston & Orson Welles) that helped create one of the greatest periods in movie history.The film begins with Kane's death as the story looks back at his life.  A reporter is assigned to discover the meaning of Kane's last word.  The first flashback shows Kane as a young boy and the event that would have an effect on him for the rest of his life.  It goes from his time with his caretaker to inheriting a fortune to opening a newspaper company.  The second flashback looks at the early and idealistic period of Charles Foster Kane.The fourth flashback focuses on Charles Foster Kane's first marriage, his political ambition\/disgrace, and his failed marriage.  This flashback also reveals the affair that ruined his political career and first marriage. The next flashback shows his second marriage with Susan Alexander as well as her opera career, firing of Jed Leland, and the construction of Xanadu.  The film climaxes with Kane's loniness and yearning to return to his days of innocence.  The reporter comes to the conclusion that there is no conclusion to the meaning of Charles Foster Kane.There are four remarkable sequences in Citizen Kane.  One, the opening scene.  Two, the passage of time scene where the distance between Charles Kane and his wife widen.  Three, the opera scenes with Susan Alexander. Four, the closing scene.Citizen Kane was co-written by Herman J. Mankiewich and Orson Welles.  The direction helps carry the story along.  William Randolph Hearst hatred the film and tried to have it destroyed.  It didn't help that Hollywood resented Welles for being a genius and an upstart.  Citizen Kane(1941) and The Trial(1963) were the only films in which Orson Welles had complete artistic control.Citizen Kane is a great film that was cheated out of many Oscars including Best Picture.  The director had used the John Ford\/John Wayne vehicle Stagecoach(1939) as an inspiration for his feature debut.  In fact, Welles had watched Stagecoach about forty times during the making of the film. The cast and crew were members of Welle's Mercury Theatre.

In fact, I thought it might be the ultimate haunted house film... right up there with the classic Universal films of the 30s and 40s. Seeing it years later though, it didn't hold up very well at all. In fact, the scares, special effects and dialog looked campy and even silly. Time reveals all.That being said, the new film is bound to fare even worse. To say that it is a bad remake is just to scratch the surface. Here are some of my main complaints 1) The dialog is so stilted and full of unnecessary and repeated epithets and obscenities it sounds like an HBO original. Throughout, you have the desire to see all these people chased out of the house and out of the film by a pack of hounds. 2) A haunted house movie should give you a good view of the house, shouldn't it? Well the few exterior shots that are used seem to be of a faceless monolithic structure high atop a mountain. There are no distinguishing characteristics or even a closeup. I thought it looked like a computer generated image from a Batman movie. 3) To follow the suspended disbelief and logic set up by the film A house that is alive and so intelligent that it can connect online with a computer and alter a party guest list to invite whom it wishes, should be able to tell if those guests are the ones desired when they arrive... shouldn't it? I nominate the line I was adopted! as the stupidest line in a horror film ever. 4) The plot is not new, of course. But it has been done better by The Haunting and The Haunting of Hill House to name a Make\/Re-make combo. This time, however, the cartoonish character portrayals are an albatross around the already feeble attempt at a story. This doesn't create the illusion of reality, suspense or even interest.  5) Blood. You like it? You want it? They have it here by the bucket and bathtubful. Do filmakers actually think this creates a good horror movie? I am certain that someone somewhere has measured audience shock response to the sight of blood and the number of time it is shown per minute and calculated down to the last drop how much to slosh across the screen to maximize box office attendance. For me, I was disgusted and angry after about 15 minutes. 6) Inconsistencies. All movies have some. This one is no exception, but these are too obvious to mention and pale in comparison to all the other problems.If you like slasher movies, this has the blood but not the payoff you want. If you like horror, this is a horrible move but doesn't really scare. If you just like good movies, find something else to rent.

The story of a mad man who was able to bring a dead person back to life has shocked nations and generations and will shock in the future as well.  This is probably one of the reasons why Mel Brooks' movie is so great.  He was able to take a serious story, almost traumatising and make a classic comedy out of it.  His movie is a pure satire from beginning to end and this is where you can see how hard he must have worked on this movie.  His more recent movie Spy Hard (1996) was quite disappointing because the humor there seemed much more sexual and the parody wasn't all that great.  The only interesting part of that movie was the variety of different scenes Brooks mixed in although they didn't really blend well together.  In most movies in which you have a very rich man and his butler, the butler is quite often very funny and delivers some of the best jokes.  The best example for that would have to be John Gielgud's role in Arthur (1981) which won him a best supporting actor Oscar.  He played a wise-cracking butler who was able to be snide to his master without being too impolite.  However, I seem to find that Martey Feldman as Igor in Young Frankenstein was even funnier than John Gielgud was in Arthur.  This is the second part of Young Frankenstein.  Finally, the third part of Young Frankenstein has to with family reputation.  Gene Wilder plays Fredric Frankenstein and does not like his name because of the reputation it was given by his crazy grandfather.  He wants nothing to do with his past family but when his great grandfather's will is found and asks him to return to Transylvania, he sees no choice but to go out of respect for his predecessor.  Upon arriving in Transylvania, he quickly meets Igor and is taken to the Frankenstein castle.  There, he soon becomes obsessed with the idea of bringing a dead human being back to life.  This obsession is provoked by a woman who works at the castle and who was the mistress of Fredric's grandfather.  The rest of the story is developed in a very similar way to the original terrifying classic only in a highly comic manner.  Gene Hackman has a cameo as a blind priest and his scene is one of the funniest ones in the movie.  Mel Brooks smartly directs this movie letting the viewer hope some things happen and others won't.  Gene Wilder's contribution to the script is another plus and he delivers his role very well.  The scene in the classroom is highly comic.  Also noticeable is Teri Garr who plays young Frankenstein's assistant in the laboratory room.  But Martey Feldman walks away with the movie as the snide and hilarious butler Igor.  He plays the role of one those people who make you laugh just by appearing on the screen. You won't want to miss this one.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"25 September 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"    Frankenstein is one of the best horror stories ever told in the history of mankind.  The story of a mad man who was able to bring a dead person back to life has shocked nations and generations and will shock in the future as well.  This is probably one of the reasons why Mel Brooks' movie is so great.  He was able to take a serious story, almost traumatising and make a classic comedy out of it.  His movie is a pure satire from beginning to end and this is where you can see how hard he must have worked on this movie.  His more recent movie Spy Hard (1996) was quite disappointing because the humor there seemed much more sexual and the parody wasn't all that great.  The only interesting part of that movie was the variety of different scenes Brooks mixed in although they didn't really blend well together.  In most movies in which you have a very rich man and his butler, the butler is quite often very funny and delivers some of the best jokes.  The best example for that would have to be John Gielgud's role in Arthur (1981) which won him a best supporting actor Oscar.  He played a wise-cracking butler who was able to be snide to his master without being too impolite.  However, I seem to find that Martey Feldman as Igor in Young Frankenstein was even funnier than John Gielgud was in Arthur.  This is the second part of Young Frankenstein.  Finally, the third part of Young Frankenstein has to with family reputation.  Gene Wilder plays Fredric Frankenstein and does not like his name because of the reputation it was given by his crazy grandfather.  He wants nothing to do with his past family but when his great grandfather's will is found and asks him to return to Transylvania, he sees no choice but to go out of respect for his predecessor.  Upon arriving in Transylvania, he quickly meets Igor and is taken to the Frankenstein castle.  There, he soon becomes obsessed with the idea of bringing a dead human being back to life.  This obsession is provoked by a woman who works at the castle and who was the mistress of Fredric's grandfather.  The rest of the story is developed in a very similar way to the original terrifying classic only in a highly comic manner.

The rest of the film has an odd, surrealistic flavor as well, but nothing tops the way these British schoolkids seem to have been transported to the island, Star-Trek style. So, obviously, these kids are to be taken as symbols of humanity, not real peoole.Because of the film's surrealistic symbolism, I found some of its themes to have an immature viewpoint and to represent a disturbing, socially-bigoted view. Certainly in `the real world', the boys' descent into savagery would have more to do with their being spoiled rich kids without any real values or discipline than it would any kind of inevitable devolution in to primitivism. The tribal societies they emulate with their painted bodies and chants were not chaotic bands of louts and idiots, as the boys in the movie become. Now, granted, the visual impact of the film would be greatly diminished with out this primitive look, but equating this kind of look with evil and chaos is just stupid. It would have been much more compelling (thematically, if not visually) if the kids were not made to look and act like extras in an old Tarzan movie, OR if the good voice-of-reason kids weren't the only ones not to do so. The symbolism of rules and order equal western clothing styles vs dressing in clothes appropriate to the climate equal savagery, chaos and evil is inescapable. And dumb. They could have all acted and dressed British and we still could have had the same conflicts. If the film had been more realistically portrayed, then all this could be written off to kids who actually were imitating the racist images seen in the movies, not knowing any better. But it is obvious that the filmmakers intended everything and every one in this movie to be symbolic rather than realistic. So the imitation savagery must also be taken as symbolic and purposeful.

You can tell a lot about a person by how they react to it.The dimmer bulbs will complain they just didn't get it.  The plot leaves a lot up to the viewer -- if you don't pay attention and try to fill in some of the blanks on your own, this movie will lose you in the first half hour.  Most of what's going on is never explained, and must be inferred -- I think a lot of people will have to see this one twice.The moderately bright will be impressed by the film's treatment of mathematics, patterns, and a conspiracy that spans reality itself.  This is inherently cool stuff, but has already been handled better by the likes of William S. Burroughs and Robert Anton Wilson.  Ultimately, the mathematics angle falls flat...  I had to suppress an outright laugh at lines about machines becoming self-aware after being fed a certain equation, or the main character -- a mathematician -- accusing some rabbis searching for the True Name of God of already trying every 216-letter combination -- a feat which would require more time than our planet has been in existence.The places where this film shines are in the editing, the soundtrack, and the overall look of the film.  The plot is ultimately shallow, a story that could probably have fit on a single page, but the film is techno-noir eye candy de luxe.  I am looking forward to see what the director does with the formidable writing talents of Frank Miller on his side in the forthcoming Batman Year One movie.  As for Pi, I probably won't be springing for the DVD anytime soon -- but I *will* be purchasing the soundtrack.

However, just two years on and I find I can't remember enough about them in order to do it &#150; I guess they couldn't have made much of an impression. From what I do recall, some of the sequels &#150; Dream Warriors in particular &#150; weren't as bad as is often made out, though even the original was no classic. Generally, the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams) doesn't lend itself to narrative tension. But while I cannot recall much of the first five films, I do know they never plumbed the depths of Freddy's Dead.An indication of how sick of Freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the character's demise. The fact that the movie's conclusion is not even hidden, but in fact the entire purpose for the film's being goes to illustrate how vacant, soulless and cynical this venture was.Taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain, Robert Englund's in-no-way-scary interpretation booms with laughter. I always thought Freddy's mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe. It's like Englund's crying out we know this is garbage &#150; but you're paying to see it, so who's the one laughing? And I'm sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight. Was Freddy's appearance in the films always so rudimentary? All he gets to do here is a few haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr &#150; har &#150; har &#150; hars and that's it. If this was the only Elm St. film you'd ever seen you wouldn't get to know the character at all. Even as the character pre-death in a flashback Englund plays him as a boo-hiss pantomime villain with a slop of Transatlantic (ie. overstated, misplaced and not at all funny) irony.Acting is almost universally poor. Just look at how many times Breckin Meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language. Only Kananga himself, Yaphet Kotto, keeps his dignity. And when Roseanne, Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper show up, you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire. The script, too, is absolutely lousy, almost wholly without merit. Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a road map, upon which the Noel Coward-like Freddy has wittily written you're f**ked. When prompted for the map, Carlos responds well the map says we're f**ked. Who wrote the screenplay, Oscar Wilde?Or how about the scene where Carlos is tortured by Freddy, his hearing enhanced to painful levels? So Freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin &#150; a potentially fatal sound, given that all sounds are magnified. Oddly, the fact that Carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect. Nice hearing from you, Carlos, quips Freddy, hoping some better lines will come along. It's also worth noting that dream sleep doesn't occur instaneously, so being knocked unconscious wouldn't allow instant access into Freddy's world. Though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3-D finale plot logic isn't that high on the list of requirements.The teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious, dislikeable group in the whole series. Tracy (Lezlie Deane) is the only one who gets to greet Freddy with shut the f**k up, man and a kick in the scallops. And was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients? Freddy's Dead.
