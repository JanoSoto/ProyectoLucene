This was a beautiful and well done movie.  Mike Myers is cool as the ogre.  Cameron Diaz does a magnificent job as the lovely Princess Fiona.  But Eddie Murphy is hilarious as the donkey.  He definitely got my tickle bone going.  A well done and quite fun movie.  ....And they lived ugly ever after.  The End.  ***1\/2stars.
