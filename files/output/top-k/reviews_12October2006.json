It therefore combines the tension of a thriller with the poignant emotions of an elegy.But what I loved most about this movie is that there are no clichés. Kevin Costner's character, Billy Chapel, is not a sports underdog. It's very clear he is a great athlete who has had a great career, and that he can walk away at any time with lots of money and lots of respect. The only reason that pitching the perfect game matters to him is purely for the perfection of his art -- for the love of the game.At the same time, not all the action is on the baseball diamond. In the romantic drama, Kevin Costner does much more than play the usual Costner nice guy. Billy Chapel can be cold, egocentric, and difficult -- just like any other creative artist. But he always surrounds himself with people who are strong enough to challenge him and help him stay grounded. It's no exaggeration to say that the supporting cast in this film -- John C. Reilly as the catcher, Kelly Preston as the girl friend, and Jena Malone as the girl friend's adorable teenage daughter -- are very much the stars. They really set Costner up for an unusually mature, disciplined performance. Just the way Chapel's team mates set him up for the perfect game! This movie wasn't that well received by the critics. I remember one frightfully cultured fellow at the NEW YORKER sniffing that Costner's character is arrogant. Note well that if an artist or an intellectual is cold and demanding, it's okay. But athletes should be jolly, ape like simpletons, the kind who know their place. This complex, poignant movie is actually quite subversive, since it forces you to realize that baseball is a thinking man's game and that athletes (and their working class fans) are not nearly as stupid as the real simpletons who write for the NEW YORKER.Shocking!!!

The characters are a little bit over-the-top. And some are horribly stereotyped and lacking dimension the upper middle class couple who are obviously refined and look down their noses at the blue collar class (this is stated with Bill and Joan's visit to Joe's home); the super archetypal Archie Bunker who drinks Bud (naturally!), bald (of course no one refined would be bald!), unworldly and borderline illiterate (he never heard the word culture? He is not familiar with the cliché When in Rome...? That's not just uneducated but isolated from humanity.), and crass (without exception blue collar people eat like pigs!). I realize that the Joe character must be an idiot with few redeeming features in order to construct the plot and not evoke any sympathy for his particular plight in life, but it is so in-your-face that it detracts. (You don't need to beat us over the head with what kind of guy he is. Just the movie title is a big hint.) You would think they could have forgone one stereotypical feature to at least make some attempt at believability.Some of the acting is reminiscent of the stiff Dragnet exchanges. For example, I cannot remember the exact quote so I will paraphrase, Get this. The old man says, 'I got all the grass I need, sonny boy.' Is he putting me on? I mean, really. This is so stilted you can almost see the actor's eyes moving across the lines.Also, some of the development is too quick to be effective. For instance in the final sequence when Bill Compton is furious with Joe, all Joe has to say to finalize his personality conversion is, Hey! Don't kill me, kill them! In an instance we witness a complete personality flip in Bill. True, the whole event started with Bill accidentally killing someone and *uncharacteristically* feeling some pleasure about it, so he does have it in him. But he was never presented as someone with the potential of a cold blooded killer. I think it would have been much more effective to draw his inner rage out more gradually; some horrific event involving his daughter needed to occur to complete his transmogrification, not just her running away. To be fair, there was some gradual change in Bill over the course of the movie, but for the most part he seemed to be going along with Joe in order to hush him and use him rather than be him. He never convincingly converted to a Joe even though the movie attempts to tidy this up with their political agreements about society.That said, I do think the final scene has good emotional impact. The message of the movie is clear the generation gap is so wide that it's dangerous. Also, I do like the fact that not everyone is so one dimensional. Some do have at least a hint of good and bad. For example, it would have been too easy to make the victims ridiculously Pollyannaish, but thankfully the hippies, too, have their flaws. They come off more like self-indulgent children rather than self-proclaiming purveyors of social change, which how I personally view them. (Not to deter, but to that point, if the anti-war movement was so sincere about fixing the ailments of society, why instead of partying in San Francisco in 1967 didn't they march out to the poor nations of the world and build homes and feed the poor? Because it was more about self-indulgence than truly helping fellow man.) I think that element gave it some depth--not much, mind you, but it could have been worse.I recommend the movie to anyone interested in that period and who can ignore the Dragnet like features. It may have its laughable delivery from time to time, but its point is very visceral and relevant to the times.

But overall, this seems to me to be the kind of film where the director had such carte Blanche and freedom to do with whatever he wanted with the material, no one ever even tried to reel him in or ask 'does this make sense?' Maybe that's what makes Satyricon the flawed plum that it is, but it's sometimes a slog getting through it. It's a shame to say things as pat about Fellini Satyricon like 'it's meandering' or 'it loses cohesion' or 'I asked 'who is that character again' too much', but they pretty much do apply, even if you are a really big fan of the movie. In a sense I am too, but not exactly at the same time.In the purely visual sense, it's what the word spectacular really comes closest to in terms of personal Roman epics. Surreal or bizarre or debauchery comes to mind as well, but really if this was a silent film (and it comes to mind a couple of times that Fellini would have risen to the likes of Lang or even Eisenstein if he had been making films in the silent era), it would be in my top ten of all time. Through one of the great Italian master cinematographers, Giuseppe Rutono, Fellini glides and pirouettes and makes his Roman epic with the mad ideas and persistence to not back away from keeping the vision consistent. At the least, Fellini never makes it a drag to look at, and his production values- the designs and mix of real locations with expansive Cinecitta sets, usage of colors, costumes, props (including severed limbs and heads), and adding to this Nino Rota & company's strange musical accompaniments- are just as superb, if not even more extravagant, than those for his previous color film Juliet of the Spirits.If the visuals and the look and style of the film help make this world of Rome where there's no real authority and sex and power is up for grabs, the actual substance then has to be taken into account. I understand too what Fellini was after, in terms of not just the period of Rome at the time (I'm not sure totally when, but in the apparent absence of senators and the republic), but also in the 1969\/1970 sexual and political revolutions going on across the world. There's madness in every direction, just as, at least seemingly, in real life. But what Fellini is lacking is a portal for the viewer to really latch onto with this travelogue of Encolpio (Martin Potter), who starts off with a slave, loses him, tries to find him, but ends up with a friend Ascylito. There's big fights while slaves themselves on a boat, decadent romps with ladies, more fights- to the point of them being gladiatorial- and only brief moments where Fellini lets the viewer take a rest from all the large pomp and circumstance. There's a lot of energy to many scenes, sexually charged in fact, and the first half of the film flows really well. Yet after a while, the narrative thread- or what may be left of it can't be made this loose for too long before not feeling as satisfactory as the images surrounding it. In a sense, I realize, this film could even make a comparison with Antonioni's Zabriskie Point as two films from Italian directors who take on the complete abandonment of morals and social order and relish (and sometimes recoil) in the thought of it actually taking place. If neither director is totally successful, it's no wonder why the term Carte-Blanche and wild auteur filmmaker only once in a while mix excellently.

There's no real style or particularly strong use of light & shadow so all I can think of is that the filmmakers thought it would look more arty, or something like that. Forget about decent blood or gore, there's some fake blood splashed around but nothing graphic.Apparently shot in twenty days technically The Addiction is alright although the black and white cinematography did nothing for me. The acting was OK, Christopher Walken fans should be aware that despite his near top-billing in the credits he has nothing more than a cameo.The Addiction may appeal to some upper class film critics who think they can see lots of meaningful moral messages in it, personally I thought it was crap & nearly put me to sleep. Did nothing for me at all I'm afraid.

It was okay but disappointing. I expected more after hearing of its great reputation. True, it was interesting but it had too many frustrating and annoying parts for my tastes. It was not the feel-good film I was expecting.I admit the ending was terrific and brings a tear to one's eye with an inspiring message but much of the film deals with tough breaks that George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) had to face and also featured a very mean, despicable dishonest man in Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore). A lot of those scenes were not fun to watch; more frustrating than anything else. The movie has several scenes in which Bailey isn't the best person, either, but it could be argued that everyone has their moments, so why not him, too? Since this is so beloved a film, and such a Christmas favorite, I just expected more of a nice, lighthearted, good-natured story. Instead, I got a very dramatic movie with a number of unpleasant scenes.Interesting that this would be a Christmas favorite when Stewart's character admits he doesn't know if God answers prayer, or if He's even there. All of this coming from a guy who's attended church for years? Well, at least he found out, and it was a good message.The message was that everyone's life counts for something, that life is important and what you do with it especially important because it effects not just you but a number of other people many times in ways you could never imagine.To its credit, the story is an involving one.

Looking past that, I realized that the relationship between Leon and Mathilda, which so many of the negative reviews I read trashed, was based on the very real emotions of a man dedicating his life to death and loneliness and a girl with nothing and no one left to confide in except her savior--Leon himself.I don't particularly believe in much of Freud's work, but the every son is in love with his mother argument seems to come into play here, especially considering this mother is so easy to idolize--cool identity, cool job, great ability (the U.S. version wasn't called The Professional for nothing)--not to mention her adult-like attitude towards life clashes so easily with her childish one-track mind...kill the killers, then become an assassin. What is unrealistic about that to a child; moreover, a child taken in by a hit-man?

FREEDMAN August 16, 1987KELLERMAN'S, THE FICTIVE Catskills hotel that provides the setting for the new film ''Dirty Dancing,'' is meant to be more than the sum of its parts, which are golf, gossip and gefilte fish. It stands as a metaphor for America in the summer of 1963 - orderly, prosperous, bursting with good intentions, a sort of Yiddish-inflected Camelot. So when Frances (Baby) Houseman, the doctor's daughter at the film's center, loses both her virginity and her political naivete to a street-smart dance teacher, the collision should shake the audience, too, out of a certain complacency.These, at least, are the intentions of Eleanor Bergstein, the novelist (''Advancing Paul Newman'') who both wrote and co-produced ''Dirty Dancing''. It will be up to critics and the public to decide how well Ms. Bergstein and the director, Emile Ardolino, have managed to embody such serious ideas in a movie that also aspires to be a summer divertissement - one part ''Flashdance,'' one part ''Baby, It's You.''To Ms. Bergstein, the two poles of the movie are consonant. Growing up in Brooklyn, she moved effortlessly from tutoring inner-city students in the afternoon to shimmying in ''dirty dancing'' contests at night. Similarly, she says, the rock-and-roll that subverts the dance floor etiquette at Kellerman's during the film anticipates a whole array of exciting and disquieting things to come later in the 1960's - the antiwar movement, the sexual revolution, the uprisings in cities and on campuses.''I meant 'Dirty Dancing' to be a celebration of the time of your life when you could believe that a kind of earnest, liberal action could remake the world in your own image,'' Ms. Bergstein said in a recent interview in her Upper West Side apartment. ''The film couldn't have been set a few months earlier or later. The summer of 1963 was the first one after the Cuban missile crisis, which everyone had been following on television. The effect on kids was to make them very scared, and, for the first time, very suspicious of their elders maybe things wouldn't work out all right.''But the thing that kept the optimism going was John Kennedy himself - young and energetic and sexy. So maybe you could have it all. It was the summer of the Peace Corps and the summer of the 'I Have a Dream' speech. It was like the last summer of liberalism. Because two months after the movie is over, J.F.K. is assassinated. And two months after that the Beatles are on the 'Ed Sullivan Show.' And after that, it's radical action.''''Dirty Dancing'' had its genesis years ago in a more domestic image that fascinated Ms. Bergstein - two daughters in the same family, one raised to be beautiful, the other brainy.Gradually, the writer's notion of the sisters coalesced with her sense of how some people live through dance and popular music. These ideas, in turn, dovetailed with Ms. Bergstein's autobiographical recollections of Catskills summers, ''dirty dancing'' contests and 1960's activism, providing a narrative framework for the screenplay. And by co-producing her own film, Ms. Bergstein retained a rare degree of leverage over its final form.Unlike some recent films,''Dirty Dancing'' treats the idealism of the 1960's as a genuine expression of faith, not a passing fad.Baby Houseman plans to study the economics of the third world and to enter the Peace Corps. Neil Kellerman, the grandson of the hotel's owner, expects to join the Freedom Rides in the South. Almost everything about Kellerman's attests to the heyday of New York, Democratic Party liberalism. Ms. Bergstein based her characterization of Kellerman's on memories of childhood summers spent at Grossinger's. She evokes some of the more familiar elements of the Borscht Belt, but with the affection of one who had shared in them.''I didn't want to make it ugly and vulgar,'' Ms. Bergstein said of Kellerman's. ''It was a world of grace and elegance and - yes - liberal values. I remember that when my family went to the Catskills, you had busboys who were going to take a semester off from college to go on the Freedom Rides. When the three civil rights workers were killed in Mississippi, there was a candlelight vigil.''But as ''Dirty Dancing'' shows in some moments and suggests in others, places like Kellerman's (and, by extension, Kennedy-era America) could not sustain their placid, satisfied existence. When Baby Houseman (Jennifer Grey) follows a friendly bellboy to the staff quarters at Kellerman's, she wades into a blue-collar life of jacked-up cars, raunchy rock-and-roll, and sneers at the affluent, all of it personified by a dance instructor named Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). She gradually gains some acceptance in this world by substituting for Johnny's pregnant dance partner in a mambo show at a nearby resort, after having lied to her father to get $250 for the partner's back-room abortion. Baby's father, Jake (Jerry Orbach), ultimately learns of the ruse, the abortion and his daughter's burgeoning romance with Castle; and the favored child, ''Daddy's girl,'' has to stand on her own.

She gradually gains some acceptance in this world by substituting for Johnny's pregnant dance partner in a mambo show at a nearby resort, after having lied to her father to get $250 for the partner's back-room abortion. Baby's father, Jake (Jerry Orbach), ultimately learns of the ruse, the abortion and his daughter's burgeoning romance with Castle; and the favored child, ''Daddy's girl,'' has to stand on her own. Baby becomes Frances....

For the record I am a passionate fan of the novels, and thought the recent Keira Knightley Pride and Prejudice too silly and modernized. The ads and previews for Mansfield Park on its theatrical release made it seem like a revisionist, sexed-up bit of trash, so I skipped it. What wasn't stressed then, and makes watching the DVD worthwhile, is that it is revisionist in a very thoughtful, interesting way. Note that the movie claims to be based on both Mansfield Park AND Jane Austen's journals and other writings. It never claims to be a straight filming of the novel. Fortunately it is beautifully made and has integrity in being faithful both to aspects of the book and to the writer\/director's interpretation of it. It earns the liberties it takes with the novel.No, this is not Jane Austen's Fanny Price. Fanny has been re-imagined as Jane Austen herself, a woman of intelligence and talent for whom ideas and writing are essential to life. The wild stories we hear Fanny reading to her sister are passages from Austen's Juvenilia, and we also hear passages from Austen's journals and other writings. I've never been a Fanny-hater myself, but I did love this new Fanny. I was surprised at the absence of Fanny's brother, but the writer\/director (Patricia Rozema) has combined William with Susan for the sake of economy. As she explains in the commentary track, she retained Susan instead of William since Susan's character has a conclusion, as it were.The abolitionist theme that is very subtle in the book is played up here. Not with preachy monologues and 21st century anachronisms, but by dialogue and events that come naturally from the characters. There have always been abolitionists. Other, more overt motifs in the novel, such as improvements and acting, do not get much screen time. Changes are also made in chronology, and there is a brief caught in flagrante sex scene that doesn't deserve the scorn heaped upon it.What emerges in this movie is a great, vibrant heroine, the hybrid Austen\/Fanny character. Austen's journal writings are haunting, echoing and summarizing many of the themes of her best characters and fiction. Frances O' Connor gives a fantastic performance as the adult Fanny, supported by as fine an ensemble cast as I've ever seen. The movie has a wonderful score, and looks just right. Deliberately not as opulent as some adaptations, this film makes the signs of decay around the house of Mansfield Park subtle but unmistakable.This version of Mansfield Park is not a straight depiction of the novel, and the adaptation won't be to everyone's taste. Patricia Rozema does know Austen's work, but as a filmmaker realizes that you can't just transfer great prose onto a screen. She made choices as to which themes to bring out and which to ignore, and made changes in character and dialogue to give the movie a life of its own. These choices were made for artistic reasons, not out of ignorance of Austen. You could ask, Why not just write an original screenplay if you're going to change so much? I think it's because Rozema and we love Austen, and Austen is still at the heart of this film, just beating a different rhythm.

An American Rhapsody is an interesting movie but nothing more.I watched it mainly because i heard Nasstasja Kinski was in it. I'm a big fan of hers but she isn't so great here and i think it's not her fault. It's the script actually. There's one awful moment in particular that i recall now and it always makes laugh but not because it's funny - it's really stupid actually. It's the scene where the little Zsuzsi says shit at the party, something that her sister has thought her - it's really one stupid and predictable situation and it's not funny at all. The conversations are also too standard sometimes and although the core story is really interesting i don't think the director has managed to justify it. I also didn't like Scarlett Johansson in the role of Zsuzsi. She is really boring in this film.Nevertheless the film is still very interesting at times. As i've already said the core story is really good, there are several very good scenes, Nastassja Kinski is still very attractive, the girl that plays Zsuzsi as a kid is very sweet and fun to watch. I also liked the depiction of America in the 50's and also the life behind the Iron Curtain. There are still some very interesting ideas. I especially liked the scenes when Zsuzsi return to Hungary as a teenager and the story that her grandmother tells her, when she realizes what her mother went through to secure her a good life. But Johansson really wasn't for that part. I don't understand why didn't they get an Eastern European actress. It would have been so much easier and much more efficient.

Mainly because Gilliam is far more intelligent than you, both in his use of visual metaphors and sexual innuendo but also in the fact as a director he thinks of things even Tim Burton would be jealous of.Okay the film tales off towards the end, but after to been subjected to such a rich bombardment of visual genius can you blame Terry for being tired.9 out of 10 And my favourite bit is when Eric Idle chases the bullet!!!!!

I get very annoyed with these armchair film experts who think just because they've sat on their backsides for twenty years, neglecting everything except their expanding waist lines feel they have a god given right to pass judgement on a great film maker's hard work. I've made films and let me tell you EXPERTS out their it's the hardest thing you could ever undertake, harder even than getting off your butts and getting some exercise.Baron Munchausen is in my opinion a visionary masterpiece, like Brazil and Time Bandits its pure escapism, but intelligent python-Esq escapism.

Another reason why it generated so much buzz was because it is such a well-crafted and entertaining film. When Bonnie sees Clyde for the first time outside of her house, stealing her mother's car, she is intrigued. When Clyde tells her that he did time for armed robbery, she is attracted. When Clyde flashes his gun, she is hooked. Director Arthur Penn explicitly makes us see the appeal of Warren Beatty in this blunt opening scene, highlighting the latter's inherent bad-boy-who-can-be-changed appeal that Bonnie falls for. The two set out in stolen cars, traveling through the seedy rural side of Lousiana, Texas, Missouri and Oklahoma &#150; while the raw feel of the depression invests the film is a damp, murky and barren tone. Bonnie and Clyde are in fact both hicks &#150; Bonnie a restless waitress and Clyde a two-time parole. The Great Depression era belonged to the people; it was arguably the first time politicians were placed in the backseat to make room for the people of the nation, catering to their increasingly desperate needs and poor living standards. 'Bonnie and Clyde' mercilessly zooms in on its conditions, thereby acting as social criticism of sorts. Its two titular characters despise bureaucracy and loathe the law. When they pick up two hostages, both of whom tremble with fear over being in the custody of two notorious criminals, Bonnie and Clyde inform them that Why would we hurt you? Ya'll are folks, just like us.While the Southern drawl pleasantly dawdles on throughout the film, so does the sense of impending doom. Realism starts to kick in as members of the Barrow gang (Bonnie, Clyde, Clyde's brother, his wife and their getaway-driver) suffer conflicts &#150; both external and internal. It ceases being 'fun and games' and snowballs into a killing spree that often culminates in fierce car-chases and hard-boiled showdowns with the cops. How far are they willing to go?They go far. Too far. Thankfully, their last journey is crafted with deft strokes. From the seedy setting, the fantastically layered acting from Faye Dunaway, Warren Beatty and Gene Hackman, the deft wielding of moods in the story to the final culmination &#150; it is all of the utmost quality and it locks you into fast-paced world of Bonnie and Clyde, bravely plunging into their imperfections and passions, fully humanizing them toward the end. The cinematography is plain beautiful, earning an Oscar in this category, especially the scene in which a patient steadicam glides far above a field of dried maize crops in which Bonnie and Clyde become smaller and smaller as the camera zooms out. There is no doubt in my mind that Penn has done something exceptional here and that Bonnie and Clyde is the best film of 1967. 8 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 October 2006","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" The aforementioned naturally relegated Bonnie and Clyde to a controversial status when it was released in 1967 &#150; and it is still a bold staple in film today, given its content of two hard-boiled killers navigating robberies and murders under the banner of 'love' in the deep necks of the American South during the 1930's Depression.
