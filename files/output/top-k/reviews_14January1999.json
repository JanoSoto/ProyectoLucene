Tripplehorn is not quite right but manages a very venomous version of Lydia (Cruella DeVille's less nice sister). This movie was entertaining without being particularly demanding, just one to sit back and enjoy. I had thought it'd be a bit of a chick flick and it was, but not overly so. The big mystery still remains 'though, why were two gorgeous and sexy women fighting over a jerk like Jerry anyway? Fun movie and very watchable. My vote 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 January 1999","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Paltrow is very endearing as Helen, most of the cast is very good, especially Hannah as James.
