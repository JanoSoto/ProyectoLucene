I have to admit, I was more impressed and entertained the first time around. Sure, the film is reality-challenged, with several absurdities (misinterpretation of a black-hole, gravity problems etc), but I do not think that the film-makers were attempting to do anything as artistic as Star Wars nor anything as philosophical as Star Trek. This film, instead, fits solidly into the FUN, action-based sci-fi tradition, like Starship Troopers.The plot is pretty cliché. Freddy Prinze Jr and Matt Lillard play young hotshot fighter pilots assigned to their first deep space mission. They are being delivered by Tchéky Karyo. As they arrive on a ship commanded by David Suchet and Jurgen Prochnow, they learn that the Sol System is about to fall under attack by Kilrathi invaders with a powerful armada. There is little time for complexity and character development as the single Confederation (earth) cruiser tries to make its way to a nearby jumpgate (basically the film's equivalent of warp ten or a hyperspace button) before the Kilrathi do, fending off Kilrathi attacks the whole way. There are a couple of weakly explored love stories and a few surprises along the way concerning the identities of the characters, but there is little time for these to truly develop. So many of the characters do feel a bit one-dimensional, and the more intriguing plot points (such as the pilgrims) are left unsatisfactorily explored.I think this film would have made a better miniseries than a cinematic release. Given a little more breathing room, and perhaps time to consult with astronomers or even people with a couple of higher education science courses under their belt, this could have been a really good sci fi film. The cast was certainly decent (some of the European cast-members were very good); the money was obviously there, and the script would have been fine had it not been stretched by the overly ambitious scope of the film.Bottom line Entertaining with the help of a few drinks.

I have a lot to say here but before I begin I'd like to say that if you ever read a review that says this is a ripoff of Gremlins, ignore it. Not only is this film way better than Gremlins but it is definitely not a ripoff and I'll explain why. Okay, maybe they got the idea slightly from Gremlins but this is very original and the only thing the two films have in common is the little furry monsters that eat people (well the Critters do anyway, Gremlins is more of a Family movie). Just because Gremlins was made first means nothing. I guess every zombie movie is a rip off of Night of the Living Dead since it was (I think) the first. Also the Critters are from space and Gremlins doesn't even really have a back story (I'm not going into detail).With that out of the way, these are the reasons that Critters is an all time favorite of mine and always will be the actors playing the family (Billy Green Bush, Dee Wallace Stone, Nadine Van Der Velde and Scott Grimes) are fantastic and actually feel like a real family. I was blown away by their amazing performance, and that of every other actor in the film. The story is highly entertaining and very original too (nevermind the Gremlins similarities which everyone looks too hard for) and consists of eight killer fur balls (which look very real I might add) who escape an intergalactic prison, steal a ship then head to Earth for some tasty human flesh to snack on. But my favorite scenes involve a duo of shape shifting bounty hunters, who cause way more destruction than the Critters and have the whole town terrified (which is hilarious as I guess all they care about is getting their paycheck). In order to blend in, one of them transforms into a rockstar (Terrence Mann), and the other one changes into three different people including the town drunk Charlie (Don Opper who, along with Mann, stars in all of the Critters films). They show up and destroy a church and a bowling alley looking for the ferocious krites then finally find them at the house of the family in which the film centers around. You'll notice that they only kill one krite (!) and leave the whole town in shock with their pointless damage (it's still very funny). I could go on and on about this film which I love and own on DVD along with it's three sequels (which are still good but don't even compare with this entry) that star Opper, who eventually becomes the main character, and Mann, who returns as the alien bounty hunter Ug who is still in the same form for some reason. The direct-to-video third film actually isn't very good at all and the fourth film (which was filmed back to back with part three and was also released direct-to-video) is a whole lot better but just really depressing as the whole thing takes place in space in the future.

The product ends up being not very preachy, which is a considerable achievement given that it's built entirely around a simple parable.With the benefit of hindsight, though, one can see a few things about this that I personally find really disturbing.The question that drives the movie is whether the jurors have properly awarded the defendant the benefit of any reasonable doubt, and as the climax approaches, the attention given to this reaches a fevered pitch. Left behind in the dust, is the equally critical question of whether the defendant is really guilty. There's a scene early on when Jack Warden, the juror who just wants to get the voting over with so he can watch a ball game, meets Henry Fonda in the washroom. The last two lines in that scene discuss the possibility that the boy may be acquitted, even though he is guilty. Fonda says something to the effect of that very well may be or some such, and to my recollection this is the last time this possibility is even considered.The jury may have released a murderer onto the streets. You can make the argument that with the presence of reasonable doubt, this was their job. I agree. But as Henry Fonda walks down the courthouse steps to resume his everyday life as an architect, would it really then be fitting to have the happy a wrong has been righted swelling-orchestra music, as our hero walks proudly among his fellow citizens with his head held high? Doubt or no, conviction or no, this kind of peace-of-mind is not lying in wait for you after your last day on a real jury. There are jurors who want it anyway, and because of that, will not convict anyone. They have seen this movie, and want to be Henry Fonda. I've served with them. It's a pretty serious problem.There is a short speech given by Fonda shortly after he is revealed to be the one juror who wants to acquit. Several times in the speech he makes the point that the defendant is poor, has had a rough background, and has been beaten up a lot. It is not entirely clear where he is going with this, since the movie is supposed to be about what is reasonable doubt, and how the doubt applies regardless of economic class. There is at least one other juror who wants to convict because the defendant is poor; does Fonda mean to say with a defendant who was wealthier, he himself would have voted to convict? That doesn't seem likely at all. But then why bring it up? It means something to other jurors, but it isn't supposed to mean anything to Fonda. The only way it could support any of Fonda's arguments, is if he was making decisions based on the way those decisions made him feel about himself, rather than based on the evidence. This is something jurors aren't supposed to do.Four years after this movie was made, the Supreme Court defined the Exclusionary Rule in Mapp v. Ohio. So by this time, you weren't supposed to convict anyone unless you knew they were guilty beyond any reasonable doubt, and in addition to that, if you knew too much, then you still couldn't convict. During the sixties, conviction became such an unlikely goal even when the evidence seemed compelling, that a lot of District Attorneys refused to make arrests even though they knew a suspect posed a significant danger to society.By the seventies, Americans were so fed-up with the justice system failing us that they began turning politicians out of office in bulk, hoping against hope they could fix what was broken before their own children were murdered or their wives were raped. Between Vietnam and Watergate, this was a third salvo against our fragile faith in government, and it was an erosion of our trust that we don't talk about too much today.What really concerns me is that a little while after this film was made, with the poorest Americans being forced to live among violent people and thus becoming increasingly interested in vigilantism, suddenly we had a huge surge in movies about Taking the law into your own hands. Dirty Harry, Death Wish, and countless made-for-TV projects. In summary, the pendulum swung in one direction, then a few years later, the other. Hollywood got to make money both times.I have trouble getting completely behind this film because it's a concentrated effort, ultimately a successful one, to get that pendulum swinging wildly. If we spent that relatively short amount of time, just fifteen years or so, leaving revolution out of it and reforming our justice system in baby steps, the mistakes of the past could have been avoided. I do not know if it was possible to fix what was broken back then, by doing this -- convictions weren't always carefully considered back in the 1950's & earlier. But a lot of innocent people would be alive today if all those violent felons, in subsequent years, were arrested like they should have been.I would say, if you're going to serve on a jury, by all means rent this because it's a very meticulous and passionate reminder of your civil duty, it makes some great points, and everything in this movie is highest-quality. But also on your required-viewing list would be Primal Fear, the Richard Gere movie. Better yet, watch that one last, so the final scene really sticks in your mind.Nobody should be serving on a jury, if they can't seriously consider the consequences of releasing people who are really guilty of violent crimes.

Despite a rather good first half hour, the film quickly subsides into a dull, clichéd mess that's about as entertaining as pulling out your eyelashes with pliers. Rusty pliers, at that. 'Scream' writer Kevin Williamson wrote and directed this movie, and proved that Scream may well have been a fluke. Most of the elements of this movie have been seen a million times already in other films; and while it was OK for him to steal elements from other movies in Scream, due to the fact that it's meant as a slasher tribute; here, it just looks like he's completely ran out of ideas. The plot follows the cleverest girl in school, played by Katie Holmes. After being caught cheating along with two of her friends; the three decide to take the teacher that caught them hostage in her own home. However, this isn't just any teacher; it's Mrs Tingle, the meanest bitch in school. She isn't taking being tied to the bed lying down either, as she begins to play mind games to turn her captors against each other.The plot is very similar to the 1997 flick 'Suicide Kings', and a whole host of earlier films. It's actually not a bad idea for a movie, and if Williamson could have populated the film with interesting characters; it could have worked really well. The character of Mrs Tingle is the most interesting in the movie, but she's massively one dimensional, and like all the other characters in the film; is merely a caricature. The acting is largely diabolical, with the exception of Helen Mirren in the title role. She's suitably evil in the role, and while she doesn't have a lot to get her teeth into; she clearly enjoys herself playing the central figure. The teenage cast isn't worth mentioning, with only Katie Holmes standing out; and that's only really because of her star profile, not her acting talents.

Despite a rather good first half hour, the film quickly subsides into a dull, clichéd mess that's about as entertaining as pulling out your eyelashes with pliers. Rusty pliers, at that. 'Scream' writer Kevin Williamson wrote and directed this movie, and proved that Scream may well have been a fluke. Most of the elements of this movie have been seen a million times already in other films; and while it was OK for him to steal elements from other movies in Scream, due to the fact that it's meant as a slasher tribute; here, it just looks like he's completely ran out of ideas. The plot follows the cleverest girl in school, played by Katie Holmes.

However, this isn't just any teacher; it's Mrs Tingle, the meanest bitch in school. She isn't taking being tied to the bed lying down either, as she begins to play mind games to turn her captors against each other.The plot is very similar to the 1997 flick 'Suicide Kings', and a whole host of earlier films. It's actually not a bad idea for a movie, and if Williamson could have populated the film with interesting characters; it could have worked really well. The character of Mrs Tingle is the most interesting in the movie, but she's massively one dimensional, and like all the other characters in the film; is merely a caricature. The acting is largely diabolical, with the exception of Helen Mirren in the title role. She's suitably evil in the role, and while she doesn't have a lot to get her teeth into; she clearly enjoys herself playing the central figure.

James Cameron granted their wish and again exceeded expectations. This sequel is 10 years later, based upon the age of the central character (played by newcomer Ed Furlong). Cameron had a budget of over a dozen times the original picture and used it all to great effect. Notably, this was an early use of computer FX which are prevalent today; back then, they were simply amazing to behold (this was before even Jurassic Park '93, and each instance of their use was startling - we weren't used to it). Most of them revolved around the T-1000 super-villain (Patrick), a revolutionary approach to depicting a fantastic menace. Arnold was back as another durable cyborg, but seemed quaint & outmoded as the picture progressed.The film was another impressive progression of action and suspense, interlocked with the theme of nuclear holocaust. More than just building on the threat of nuclear annihilation from the 1st pic, the picture throws the concept at the audience with some striking images. It slows at about the halfway point when the heroes evade the pursuing super-killer for a time, but then you see that nuclear bomb going off, still about the best such depiction ever seen. Just when you think you can relax for a few minutes, a city blows up. By this time, the definitive version of this film is the 'extended' cut Cameron presented a couple of years later. The extra scenes accentuate the plot and don't slow the story down at all.Like the best sequels, it presents characters which progress and advance. This is especially true of Linda Hamilton's character; she's really lived those past 10 years and is a much older & stronger mother figure here, coarsened by ceaseless struggle. She really does turn out to be the mother of the future, as mentioned in the original pic, obsessed with saving us all from a nuclear winter. Arnold, of course, has to play a more human-like cyborg, very different from the mono-syllabic droid he interpreted earlier. The film pulls another fast one in the beginning, still keeping the audience guessing as to which is the heroic protector, Arnold or the T-1000 (the T-1000 actually seems more human than Arnold in the first 20 minutes). When the hero turns out to be Arnold, the viewer claps in appreciation for a fine role reversal. We had to wait another dozen years for the next one, but it could never be as good as this.

The fact is a story with the utmost simplicity like Snow White, the chief characters- Prince Charming, the wicked Queen\/witch, and of course Snow White- are all very basic, simple, if not one dimensional than basely two-dimensional characters. It's appropriate, to be sure, as it is based off a Grimm fairy tale. Despite the beauty and charm of the early scenes, its really on par entertainment-wise with the Silly Symphonies Walt Disney produced in the 30's. This also goes without saying that Snow White's run through the woods is one of the highlights of the film, still bringing a sense of terror and the surreal for the adults in the audience (if you're a little kid it could be one of the scariest things you've ever seen). But then- just as Snow White settles into her little 'hide-out' in a house she thinks occupied by messy, orphaned children- we're introduced to the seven dwarfs, and this is where the film picks up most of its energy, laughs, and complete and total balance. In a way, not to analyze too deep for a filmed fairy tale, they each represent the different sides of men, and so it gives the film the appropriate human dimensions it needs (in this, also setting up practically all the hand-drawn Disney films of the next seventy years or so).

Grumpy, who I found to be maybe the most complete character in the film, has attitude to spare, and gets comic bit after comic bit happen to him from the animators- and yet, there is heart behind him, and when its revealed in key parts of the film, they act as the most emotional points. There is also Sleepy, who also barely says a word, but who's physical movements are really divine little moments among the big, inspired musical numbers. Indeed, there are little moments throughout the film that help make up the greatness the mood and atmosphere in the Queen's dungeon of witchcraft; the scene where the dwarfs go to sleep (a fly that rests on Sleepy's nose); the traits given to the animals in the forest (that little turtle is hilarious).All these parts help to add to the basic structure of the story- Queen wants the good looks, goes after her once the hunter fails, gives her the poison apple, then it goes even more predictable from their (though in a good way). The detail of the animated scenes, the backgrounds, the visual effects, are often mesmerizing. And the songs, which were some of the most standard I heard from the Disney oeuvre as a kid (they were always on those Disney 'Sing-along' videos) are still whimsical most of the time. Then there is also the icing on the cake- the voice of Snow White, Adriana Caselotti (who got contracted into this being her only film role, based of producer\/uncredited director Disney's insistence), brings something to the film that's hard to describe, except to say that it's, well, serene.Even if she's not the strongest character, her main goal of making people around her feel good and inspiring happiness makes her watchable, and in a way lovable. It's a very curious, though important, factor that she (and Prince Charming and the Queen pre-witch) are animated very traditionally, apart from the cartoon-like dwarfs and animals. Its a reminder of the film's, and Disney's, strongest success- that as an imagined and visualized fairy tale, the representation is strong, and touching.

In real life, March was indeed a banker for a short while. Maybe that is part of the reason his performance is so elegant. This movie reaches so many areas of human behavior, by exploring the families reactions to the returning veterans and the later relationships between the men themselves, that it's apparent complexity is in reality the simplicity of the continued struggle for survival. Of course the rest of the cast is wonderful. Including the colorful Hoagy Carmichal as Butch, the local tavern owner, who also happens to play piano. Here's an interesting twist. In one scene Homer (the disabled vet) asks Butch if he remembers how to play  Up A Lazy River. After nodding, Butch starts to play the song and while he plays he questions Homer about why he's not at home with his family. Now in 1946, Homer's musical request must have been humorous to the viewing audience because Hoagy Carmichael wrote that song, and the audience must have known it. Carmichael was at the time a big musical star and wrote many famous songs, including Stardust and Georgia On My Mind (which was later recorded by Ray Charles) among many others. I have seen this movie many times and only came to the aforementioned conclusion during my last viewing about two months ago. That also brings me to a very important part of this film the music.

What's interesting here is that the similarity between Mr. Friedhoffer's score and Copland is deliberate. Now whether they couldn't get Copland to write the music and told Friedhoffer to make it sound that way on purpose or whether Freidhoffer did it on his own I know not. Either way the unique sound is typically (by now) and primarily American and this is a story about America. It is what we would now call Americana This movie is full of emotion.

But I've always been of the opinion that his work in Universal's The Mummy is his best.- The story in The Mummy is, in many respects, almost identical to Universal's earlier Dracula movie. Exchange a mummy for a vampire and Cairo for Transylvania and the rest is quite comparable. Both movies are basically love stories - regardless of how twisted the love may seem. Ardath Bay's sole purpose in life (or should that be afterlife) is to resurrect the spirit of his long dead love, Princess Anckesen-Amon. His 3,000 year obsession and devotion is demonstrated in the line, Anckesen-Amon, my love has lasted longer than the temple of our gods. No man ever suffered as I did for you. The response he receives a few scenes later, No. No, I'm alive. I'm young. I won't die. I loved you once, but now you belong with the dead. I am Anckesen-Amon, but I'm somebody else too. I want to live, even in this strange new world, is heartbreaking.- Other obvious and less obvious examples of how the two movies are similar include the use of religious symbols to repel the monsters, the use of hypnosis, the close-up shots of the eyes, and cast members who play basically the same roles (Edward Van Sloan and David Manners appear in both films in almost identical roles). Finally, a similarity that I've always noticed that I've not read anywhere else concerns the Renfield character from Dracula and poor Ralph Norton in The Mummy. Both become stark-raving, hysterical-laughing, mad lunatics. And whether intentional or not, both assist their respective monsters with their plans &#150; Renfield by actively helping Dracula and Norton by accidentally bringing the mummy back to life.- Karloff is perfect as Imhotep\/Ardath Bay. I've said a number of times that Karloff was born to play this role. His slim, long body looks like what I imagine a mummy might look like after 3,000 years in the hot, drying desert. Karloff's face, with the help of Jack Pierce's make-up, looks like it would turn to dust at the slightest touch. And, as most would agree, Karloff's voice has an otherworldly quality that sounds as if it were coming from the grave. Karloff's acting abilities also add to the illusion that he is the mummy. Whether his decision or that of director Karl Freund I don't know, but Karloff gives a very understated performance that is necessary if he is to be believed. The understated performance without wild, exaggerated movements is perfect for a 3,000 year old mummy. His carriage suggests a very fragile being that fears crumbling with any strenuous action. To me, Karloff simply is The Mummy.- Every time I watch The Mummy, I'm amazed at how little screen time Karloff has as Imhotep. To think that he spent 8 hours a day getting the full-body mummy treatment only to appear for a few minutes in the final film (and never a full body shot) shows an amazing amount of restraint on the part of Freund. If you're a believer in the what's not shown is more frightening that what is theory of horror, you'll appreciate Freund's decision. But the few shots where Imhotep does appear are, for me, the definition of movie magic. I'll never forget the first time I saw The Mummy. The scene where Imhotep slowly opens his eye to reveal for the first time that he is alive immediately became (and remains) for me one of the most memorable moments in horror history.

I found it annoying and boring to the extreme. Neither the plot or the acting kept my interest - I ended up finishing the movie by sheer force of will. Renee Zellweger did absolutely nothing to endear me to her character. This movie single handedly ended any appreciation I had for her work - I now avoid movies that have her in it. Bridget is more annoying than anything else. Not to mention that fat Bridget is not that fat at all - the majority of women these days wouldn't look half so good in that bunny suit. For all the glorifying praise Renee got for gaining weight, there really wasn't anything to write home about. Frumpy clothing does not make someone fat. I actually think she looked better in BJD than she did in her wedding pictures. While I love Colin Firth and Pride and Prejudice, I found his character boring and uninspired. I suppose he probably was bored and uninspired, considering this is exactly the type of role Colin keeps getting thrown into.I understand that the book (which I haven't read) was based on Pride and Prejudice, but the movie turned out as such a blatant knock off of P&P that it probably would have made more sense to acknowledge the inspiration in the previews.

Can he\/she direct as well as he\/she can act? Jodie Foster proved that it is possible with Little Man Tate, and Ben Stiller turned in a surprisingly good attempt with Cable Guy. This is Robert De Niro's first film as a director, and I must say, he fares quite well. The film gets your interest almost instantly and introduces you nicely to the environment and the characters. Unfortunately, somewhere around the middle point, I lost interest in it. I don't know if I just thought there were far too many characters to keep track of, if it took too long for it to take off or if it simply went too slow altogether... but I didn't pay much attention to the last half of the movie. The film is independent, and it shows. No big-budget stuff, but just sufficiently high production value to keep you watching. The plot is pretty good, and very well-written. I must admit, the film kept surprising me, even though it was somewhat clichéd and by-the-numbers. The pacing starts out fine, but it fails about half-way through. The acting is good, pretty much all-round, though a few actors(most noticeably, Lillo Brancato) are bad. The dialog is fairly well-written, with a few very quotable lines. Good film with a good message, but you can tell that it's a first time direction effort. I recommend this to fans of Robert De Niro, Chazz Palminteri and\/or anyone else involved in the production of the film. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 August 2005","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" When a famous actor directs a film for the first time, you're always a bit anxious.

My mom thought I'd be too scared, so I didn't go. Today though I own the film and have watched it multiple times not only for its gritty action and great suspense, but to analyze a film that successfully broke the rules and paved the way for all later cinematic big budget box office movies to follow.The opening scene in the movie is very well done, foreshadowing the horror that would later be the plot of the film. However the movie truly doesn't start until after the main characters arrive to the island in a helicopter, while trumpets blast part of John Williams theme from the movie. The filming is simple, but the effect is great in preparing people for a heart pounding thrill ride through human imagination.Throughout the movie there is great action. The suspense is gripping. In the movie, the dinosaurs are intelligent antagonists (or protagonists depending on the character's point of view) that can be gentle and yet many times deadly and terrifying. Spielberg created so many memorable scenes in the movie using different settings, dinosaurs, and action.Should this movie have had any Oscar nominations for best acting? No, the acting in this movie was good, but not anything revolutionary. However, everyone stayed in character well. Sam Neill was good as the serious Dr. Grant, and was pretty serious the entire movie. Laura Dern's acting as Dr. Sattler was probably one of the weaker performances. Richard Attenborough as John Hammond shined in some areas and in other areas was stale. The best performance had to go to Jeff Goldblum for playing Dr. Ian Malcolm. He is very energetic and humorous, thanks to the many one-liners and unique situations his character was given.Captivating is the only way to describe the scenery and sets in the movie. Everything is done in a large scale manner and is just so believable. Also, the music in the movie is a triumph. The score was one of John Williams best.What made this movie a ground breaking achievement however? Originally the movie was suppose to use all mechanical dinosaurs and miniatures.. However, that changed one day when Spielberg made a visit to ILM, which showed him a computer generated dinosaur. All the miniatures were replaced. The result was something people had never seen before. ILM put on the big screen images that were made by computers. Not all of the scenes using computer were great and sometimes they looked fake, but yet other times it was impossible to judge what was computer and what was real. The CGI in the movie, twelve years later, is still considered some of the best in any movie. With a blend of mechanical dinosaurs and CGI, the visual effects were something that took the world by surprise and blew audiences out of the water.All in all, Jurassic Park is a working piece of art and a cinematic achievement. It is also one of Spielberg's many all time great movies. The CGI craze started with Jurassic Park and has now taken big budgeted movies by storm. In decades to come, Jurassic Park, unlike dinosaurs, will not die out as just another film.Oh and to sum this all up, this movie deserves much more than a 7.4 here.

Man, I thought I couldn't be shocked by film anymore. The last 15 minutes is without doubt the most uncomfortable I have ever witnessed in film. Some people that I have spoken to who watched the film stated that they found themselves feeling a certain amount of sympathy for the paedophile psychiatrist played by Dylan Baker. I certainly felt sympathy for a fair few of the characters, not least Philip Seymour Hoffman's hopeless crank caller, but I can't say I felt that much sympathy for Baker's character. I never got the feeling that he was particularly sorry about the things that he had done, and was certainly the creepiest character in the film (which says something). On the other hand, my sympathies lay with the young Billy as you watch his world fall apart as he finds out his father is not who he believes to be, and with Joy, the only genuinely likable sister who seems to suffer one mishap after another in her pursuit of happiness.This would have been unbearable if it were not for a blackly comic sense of mischief that is apparent through the whole film. The music is almost ridiculously out of place throughout the most part of the film, which only adds to the black comedy throughout. Thankfully though, this is not used in some of the more controversial scenes. The performances are universally great, especially Philip Seymour Hoffman who manages to bring to his character a certain amount of pathos that a character as vile as his does not deserve. Ben Gazarra also does a great job as the sisters' father, while Dylan Baker puts in the most memorable turn as the family man, who suffers from the most terrible urges.Ultimately Solondz has made an unflinchingly brilliant look at the underbelly of America. This film will succeed in offending a lot of people, but he won't be bothered about that.

Located in a village which must be somewhere near the Belgian-Dutch border - but it could have been anywhere.The seasons and years pass, mentalities change - even in this small village - and so do people. The women are the strongest characters in this film which is also about the Life and Times of one particular - and peculiar - woman, Antonia, and her clan. It is funny, it is sad - like life itself. And the photography is just stunning. I saw this film ten years after it came out. The Dutch critics at the time were ferocious. This was just feminist trash, nothing 'real' about it, etc. I just re-read some of the reviews, were even worse than I remembered. The critics were amazed - to say the least - when Antonia went abroad and was highly praised - and won several prizes. In 1996 it was awarded an Oscar for best non-English language film. Today, as far as I am aware, it is shown in one cinema in The Netherlands - and only on one day a week, at a specific time. We were not even a dozen in this theater to watch the film. What a bloody shame. ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"}]
