The hospital cardiac surgeon (using overly complex medical terms that make no sense whatsoever to a layman, in a way i strongly doubt no medical doctor would do) and the hospital director who does a good job of acting like a complete bitch with only her sights on the money in face of a pair of parents that have just had a death sentence on their only child, all while sitting in a fabulous and exquisitely designed and decorated hospital board room.Denzel Washignton is a great actor, have no doubts about that, but if you've seen his other performances (fx. Manchurian Candidate, Pelican Brief, Crimson Tide etc.) you know his mannerisms and style of acting, and while he does a very good attempt at being the desperate father here, he overplays his role in a way that spoils it and adds unreality to the impression.The predicament in short JQ thinks he has Major Medical aka PPO, but he doesn't, because his employment is part-time. He ends up counting dollars, from where he can get it; church collection, garage sale of anything worth anything in the house (fridge, colour TV...). And there it goes - the obvious fact is that they just can't make it happen.Cardboard character time JQ's wife goes hysterical and tells him to DO SOMETHING to save the son. So he does it, and takes a pistol to the emergency room of the Hope Memorial Hospital (which could be any of the 7 in central Chicago, anyway.).The latter half of the movie is not much worth going into detail, because it is boilerplate hostage situation in the context of the movie; a bit of chitchat about the nasty HMO's paying doctors not to check for illness, drama between the hostages, and once in a while the continually death clock of the dying son's lowered blood pressure.Hostage negotiator comes in, starts taking, police chief comes in, makes it abundantly clear that he is only there for show and because it's election year, and, you can guess the rest.It's stuff you've seen before, done better, all of it. A particularly bothersome foolishness of the movie is that the kid, with terminally low blood pressure and barely hanging on to consciousness (if at all), has no trouble talking to his father (though in a whisper voice) in fully formed sentences that you expect from an adult, not from an intubated kid on the verge of death! This is emotional pornography of a particularly poor sort.Long story short, it ends good, yada yada yada. Absolute run of the mill drama with nothing worthy of note apart from the political message, which comes here YOU NEED UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE It's not me telling you this, it's the movie telling it to you.. no, it's screaming it at you; it's like having a billboard with HUGE LETTER SHOVED IN YOUR FACE telling you.What spoils this motion picture isn't as much the standardized plot and dialogue, or the overly melodramatical acting, no, it is the almost constant overtones of a political piece.I won't go into the political jabbering here, but I will throw a brief comment on the subject; the US medical system certainly has its flaws, but making a otherwise tear-laden family drama into a political propaganda delivery system is unbelievably cheap, and not helped by actual political figures being included (probably why most good movies use generic political figures, such as US Presidents not being named, but just being 'Mr. President' etc.); as mentioned above, just before JQ gets his car reposessed, George Bush is on the tube (looking somewhat indifferent to the plight of working poor Americans), and after the movie ends, lots of footage of protesters carrying free healthcare etc etc. slogan signs are shown, and none other than Hillary Clinton is displayed prominently as the Universal Healthcare savior of sorts.

Both became blockbusters. I grew up watching and loving both of them, but Gremlins is my favourite. Nevertheless, with Halloween nearly here, I've been reviewing horror-related movies\/TV episodes\/whatever, and Ghostbusters became a must-see again.In this movie, three scientists in New York City have found a way to catch and contain pesky ghosts. It's horror-related in that it deals with ghosts, but there's really no horror here. Ghostbusters is first and foremost a comedy. It's not non-stop, laugh out loud humour, but there's some good humour in jokes like book stacking and Get her!, as well as Ray's enthusiasm for a building and car of dubious value. The part where they catch Slimer, their first real job, is perhaps the best part of the movie for humour. Eventually they come to the big job, which makes the movie feel big- stopping the end of the world, with a Mesopotamian god called Gozer coming to New York. The Gozer and Zuul material makes for good myth, but it probably would have been more fun if they had found real ancient gods to use in this movie. Gozer was made up for Ghostbusters. They do tie in Gozer's coming with Biblical legends of the end of the world, particularly with the dead rising. Meanwhile, making Gozer a marshmallow man was inventive.This movie made me admire Bill Murray. He brings some colour to the movie, with one character comparing him to a game show host. On this re-watch, however, he didn't come across as totally likable. He's not an honest man, and when his ex-boss calls him a poor scientist, I couldn't help but think that was probably true. Nevertheless, his warning that cats and dogs may one day live together should be taken seriously.Issues with the movie start with the whole concept- isn't it cruel to imprison ghosts forever? Why does the Environmental Protection Agency always have to be the bad guy? Is environmental protection necessarily sinister? The part where Gozer tries to kill the ghostbusters for not being gods was funny- but why didn't they die? On the whole, though, Gozer is a good villain, and Ghostbusters is a fun, memorable movie.Happy Halloween.

Beginning with a wild pursuit as the great thief Asian Hawk (Jackie Chan) is interrupted whilst stealing from a tribe and makes a fine escape from their high and rocky temple. He gets away, but on returning home is confronted by an old friend, whose girlfriend has been kidnapped in order to force Asian Hawk to procure the mighty Armor Of God for an evil cult. When this film focuses on action or at least on its sense of adventure it moves along quite nicely and even for the stretches where it simply has to rely on star charisma it does so well enough. The trouble is that likable though its characters are, they aren't believable or that compelling, and the films pace is off, meaning that there is somewhat less in the way of excitement than expected. The splashes of humour don't work so well either, so the film flirts closer to losing its entertainment than is safe. Fortunately when the film does spring into action Jackie Chan provides some great moments, a fight with some amazons being very fine, as well as an exciting car chase. He gives an endearing enough easygoing turn and has decent chemistry with his co star Alan Tam, whilst the women of the piece, Rosumand Kwan and Lola Forner both provide a bit of attractive charm. Things all build to a suitably wacky finale and things come to a close on a good note, but overall I wasn't all that impressed with this one. When good, its very good but I sorely wished for more action and less filler. Those are the breaks I guess. Altogether, worth a watch for fans and Hong Kong action enthusiasts in general, but it has a fair few issues and isn't one of my favorites, though it is good enough.

Beginning with a wild pursuit as the great thief Asian Hawk (Jackie Chan) is interrupted whilst stealing from a tribe and makes a fine escape from their high and rocky temple. He gets away, but on returning home is confronted by an old friend, whose girlfriend has been kidnapped in order to force Asian Hawk to procure the mighty Armor Of God for an evil cult. When this film focuses on action or at least on its sense of adventure it moves along quite nicely and even for the stretches where it simply has to rely on star charisma it does so well enough. The trouble is that likable though its characters are, they aren't believable or that compelling, and the films pace is off, meaning that there is somewhat less in the way of excitement than expected. The splashes of humour don't work so well either, so the film flirts closer to losing its entertainment than is safe. Fortunately when the film does spring into action Jackie Chan provides some great moments, a fight with some amazons being very fine, as well as an exciting car chase. He gives an endearing enough easygoing turn and has decent chemistry with his co star Alan Tam, whilst the women of the piece, Rosumand Kwan and Lola Forner both provide a bit of attractive charm. Things all build to a suitably wacky finale and things come to a close on a good note, but overall I wasn't all that impressed with this one. When good, its very good but I sorely wished for more action and less filler. Those are the breaks I guess. Altogether, worth a watch for fans and Hong Kong action enthusiasts in general, but it has a fair few issues and isn't one of my favorites, though it is good enough.

Maybe it was just the cover on the Criterion DVD, with brilliant illustrations of the main character amid a whirlwind of carnival figures and the dead. Or maybe it was George A. Romero's citing of the film as a major inspiration for his first feature (which is hard not to notice a little bit just in the approach of the zombies). Now having finally seen it (albeit not the Criterion print but a lesser copy as part of its non-copyright status on compilations), it's... something weird. It's not altogether great, and it's in fact something that should have just been a near-perfect half an hour Twilight Zone episode. But as it stands, Carnival of Souls does get to one by its eerie tone and those figures of the dead that slip in and out of the film like out of the corner of one's eye.It's ostensibly about organist Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss in her only real performance - in Herk Harvey's only feature film as director, by the way) who is the only survivor, it would seem, of a car crash off of a bridge into a river. Or... is she alive? This is the basic thrust of the plot of the movie, but really Harvey is out to capture the psychological torment of the character, how she sometimes appears to just disappear in front of people's eyes even as she's right in front of them not being noticed. But the problem with the film is just simply that it's cheaply shot and poorly acted (the guy who plays the drunk is interesting but a real amateur, as is the woman who runs the apartment Mary stays at), and with only a handful of scenes that draw one in seriously into the complex situation of the character.Aside from that, it's kind of, well, laughable. This isn't to say that Harvey is like some Harold P. Warren making a movie on a lark and slithering away forever. Harvey was a professional, with dozens of industrial and educational films under his belt, so he knew his craft and the basics of telling a story. But there are times - and to be fair it could just be the print not being complete or missing a few frames - that scenes jump suddenly or shots are jarringly cut together. This is fine for, say, the climax of the picture with the ballroom of the dead. And to give praise where it's due, there are many minutes spent with Mary walking around that lone faraway location that are just staggering to watch.But at the same time it's not without its faults or scenes that just show its independent low-budget colors, painfully. It's a step in the right direction for psychological horror, especially considering the state of horror at the time with its low-budget equals (i.e. monster and trashy sci-fi). There is that nugget of magic one may have found in a Rod Serling produced episode of his show - how could one not see the premise fit in nicely there - only here surrounded by filler and perhaps way too many scenes of the character walking around or running without much purpose just for the atmosphere, nevermind the story. It's an O-K cult film that's some good fun with friends.
