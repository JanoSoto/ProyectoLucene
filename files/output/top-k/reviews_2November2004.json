Examples of the Alienation Effect when Claudia yells at her father, Frank MacKey's seminars, the raining frogs, and the use of camera (long takes with long shots). Titles were used, a narrator (not only the voice over at the beginning and the end), but the young boy, 'prophet', who reveals some details about the relationships in the film. The fact that there are more questions than answer, that the audience is left to question not only their existence, but also power of fate. All of these lend themselves to Brechtian theories. Upon viewing the film with this insight, one can truly appreciate the work that went into it, and could, dare I say, consider it a masterpiece.I could easily go on and on about the acting, and cinematography, both of which are utterly amazing, and work to further define and develop the story and themes, but that would cause for a long unoriginal comment, of which you would probably not want to read.

It is this extremely effective and entrancing opening sequence that quickly establishes Apocalypse Now as a movie for the mind.The viewer is taken on a strange journey up the river to meet an enigmatic figure known as Kurtz through the eyes of Willard (as narrator). On the journey we gain an insight in to the many dark facets of war and the effect that it has on one's humanity. Whether it be the insanity, the humour, the surrealness etc. It all comes across very effectively, with the characters in this film refreshingly real and the dialouge pertinent and on occasion genuinely funny.Apocalypse Now does not make the mistake (as many other war films tend to do) of manipulating you into thinking a particular way, rather it is open-ended enough for you to draw your own conclusions. We are made to feel part of the crew and witness as they do and to have our own perceptions on the events as they occur. I tend to see a movie not that one watches, but experiences.The technical aspects of the film are amazing. The cinematography is breath-taking with each scene exquisitely detailed both visually and sonically. The use of natural light in many scenes is superb (such as the mango sequence) while the music highlights the mood perfectly (The Doors was a perfect choice for the opening). The action sequences were superbly edited, especially the helicopter attack sequence coupled with Wagner blaring in the background which adds to the thrill of that scene.Not a completely realistic film, but I don't believe that that was the vision or the intent. If you crave realism, go rent Platoon as a companion piece to this. When I first saw this film (which wasn't that long ago) I knew it would be one the greatest films I'd ever see just from the first 5 or so minutes. It's a far-reaching film that delivers on all counts.

See it, then maybe read this if you like.One thing I wondered about when I watched Mouse Hunt again recently, is the nature of the mouse. Here we have a very intelligent creature, far more intelligent than any mouse usually is, closer to Jerry of 'Tom & Jerry' than a real mouse, with powers that are evidenced by things that largely happen off-screen (he is able, on two occasions, I think, to trap threatening people in a trunk - how exactly?), and a mouse which demonstrates some very human characteristics (sleeping in a miniature bed, for example).I've started to wonder whether the scriptwriter was intending us to make a deeper connection - that he is the reincarnation of Mr Smuntz Snr...It's not outside the realms of possibility the mouse is not seen until long after Smuntz' death, and isn't it odd that he should happen to occupy that particular house at that particular time? Is he perhaps there to guide his two former sons to a place where they have a better relationship and a more fulfilled life than before? All Smuntz Snr seems to have been obsessed with in life is string, and his two sons being successful and being closer than they were, both of which is achieved by the end of the film.I never quite understood why the mouse eats the first piece of string that Smuntz Snr gave to Lars before he died, and how the mouse then becomes separated from the string it has eaten with no ill effects during the house collapse. But what if this is meant to symbolise the mouse\/father taking back control in order to bestow it equally on Lars and Ernie at the end?Certainly, the mouse initially seems intent on causing a nuisance, but once it has defeated their attempts to kill it, it gives them a lot of help! Amongst other things, it gets rid of Lars' greedy wife to a Texas oil baron, destroys the old house that would have left them rich but probably unfulfilled, brings the two brothers closer than they've ever been, and by inventing cheese string, helps them out of the hole that the losses of string production had put them in and leads them to a success of their own, while enabling all concerned to have a useful function in a positive future.Or am I reading too much into it?!This was the first time I became aware of the hilarious Nathan Lane, and I thought he and Lee Evans made a great team. It's a shame they didn't double up for more films in similar roles. Bizarrely, of course, they will be working together shortly on stage in the London West End production of The Producers, following Richard Dreyfuss' departure!

He has succeeded. At the end of The End of The World, we finally see it as we should all see the Earth.The characters represent different ideologies of the different countries they're from and Wenders uses this to develop the plot. These countries are trying to seize control of one man's vision and a source of power. However, they soon find out that not one of them can control the outcome of the movie. The movie is Wender's commentary on global politics and socioeconomics. He portrays the world in a flurry of action from a European car chase to a U.S.A in recession, to a dichotomized Japan, and to an isolated Australia. It is an accurate depiction of the world we are living in now because that is how the movie was filmed - out in the streets of the real world circa the end of the 20th century which enhances the theme of the movie. If you watch this movie you will believe you are living at The End of the World. The movie is even better NOW then when it first came out. It's been 13 years since the first showing and I'm 28. Being a teenager, the sci-fi, action, fast-pace and the heroine's romance with William Hurt held my attention but to truly appreciate the WHOLE MOVIE you have to get past the juvenile\/pop culture themes. Being a woman, I identified with the heroine and the way she acts at the end of the movie and I think you will, too. The men will relate to the narrator because they tend to distance themselves from what's really going on in this movie and cut to the chase. Overall, the movie is good for the whole family to watch except for one nude scene.This summary took me awhile to write but as I went through the process of analyzing the movie from memory it became easier and easier as the film's key scenes flashed into my head.

I couldn't phrase it in a better way. Hollywood seems to think that we all have been waiting for movies based on comic books (Hellboy, Spiderman, ...) or old TV series, most of the time from the seventies (Charlie's Angels, Starsky and Hutch, ...).

But I have to be honest, I didn't think everything was bad. The fight sequences are well choreographed, but are clearly inspired on the The Matrix trilogy (including the bullet time effect, for which the Matrix films are famous), which hasn't got to be a bad thing of course.As a conclusion I would like to say that I guess that I belong to the wrong demographic to fully appreciate this movie. I think this movie will be loved most by young males in their puberty. Another possibility is of course that I ask too much of a movie. Up to you to decide which of the two is true...

It tells of aboriginal displacement without coming across as a documentary and yet still being informative and overflowing with information. Phillip Noyce's film is subtle, unique and should be looked to for inspiration.Molly, Gracey and Daisy are three half-caste girls who range from eight to fourteen years of age. Molly is their leader.

And the text per se, of course, will always exist in absolute form despite the number of hands that manipulate it.All productions (except Branagh's) cut certain elements as a sacrifice to tighter (though narrower) focus. And the use of film rather than stage allows (even necessitates) different types of dramatic development. Films unfold at a different pace than stage plays. Zefirelli's adaptations WORK as film-making, without detracting from (or unnecessarily supplementing) Shakespeare's language.

And perhaps most importantly, it works in the movie that the director is making. But on to the substantive comment...Mel Gibson was, in my opinion, too old to be Hamlet (making Glenn Close, by extension, too young to be Gertrude), but the issue of Hamlet's age has always been a problem. He's 30 in the text (this version leaves out that calculation), but that makes some of his relationships (with Ophelia, for instance) seem a little... immature.

'Supergirl' is still a terrific picture that brings back the joy of a time when you truly did believe a person could fly. Yes, it is a little campier than the first 'Superman' movie, but that is what makes it such a fun movie-watching experience. After all, it was the 80's, and in comparison to other films offered up such as 'Ishtar,' 'The Pickup Artist,' and 'Teen Wolf Too,' 'Supergirl' is a masterpiece.Helen Slater did a stellar job playing the triple role of Kara\/Linda Lee\/Supergirl. She really made the role her own, and for her first big major motion picture, came off like a pro.Faye Dunaway and Brenda Vaccaro are a wonderfully paired duo as the witch and her accomplice respectively. The blend of comedy and quirky villainy is played up well, and maintains a great balance throughout the film.One of the best aspects of the film is Jerry Goldsmith's musical score. Like 'Superman' it comes at you hard and fast from the beginning, with a beautiful opening credits sequence, and never lets up. It is one of my all-time favorite movie themes.Having the opportunity to watch the limited edition DVD, which has both the international release version and the director's cut, made the film even better.

Both versions add a new dimension to the film which round out the characters far better than was shown in the United States domestic release.All in all, if you are a fan of superhero movies, then this is one you don't want to miss. 'Hulk,' 'Dare Devil,' and 'Batman and Robin' don't hold up at all against 'Supergirl.' Suspend your disbelief and take 'Supergirl' for what it is, a fun roller-coaster-of-a-movie that delivers the goods.

MacKenna's Gold is actually a somewhat disappointing film, but it's not really the fault of director Thompson. The film is just too busy for its own good. It's as if scripter Carl Foreman and the executives at Columbia studios have decided to present the biggest, most action-packed, most unbelievable, most spectacular western ever made, but in their hurry to throw everything at the audience they've inadvertently made us suffer from sheer overkill. Just as It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World was a comedy epic that aimed too high for its own good, so MacKenna's Gold is a western that steps into exactly the same trap.MacKenna (Gregory Peck) knows the whereabouts of a horde of Apache gold, guarded according to legend by the Gods. However, instead of keeping a copy of the map (which could, of course, be stolen from him) he has committed the route to the treasure to memory. Various types want to get to the gold - bandit Colorado (Omar Sharif) being the main culprit. Colorado captures MacKenna and forces him to lead the way to the gold, but many adventures and surprises lie in wait along the trail.The cast if filled to the brim with fabulous actors, but some have such tiny roles that one has to question if a less familiar actor would've been just as suited to the part. Sometimes the all-star cast becomes a distraction and, instead of listening to the dialogue and following the plot, the audience might find themselves drawn into a game of star spotting. The plot is good fun, but very predictable and filled with so many genre clichés that it defies belief. Unusually for a western, there is a certain reliance on special effects, but sadly these effects are somewhat second-rate. MacKenna's Gold is worth catching for its curiosity value, but it is most definitely not the western-to-end-all-westerns that it aspires to be.

OK, there is a difference between the truth and this story of course, but in the end you really can see many similarities.

They decide to fake a war with Albania with the help of a Hollywood producer. They invent a story, start some rumors and studio footage is inserted into the news to create the illusion of a war, so the attention of the public is diverted away from the scandal. Of course things go wrong but time after time they know to make it work. I guess this movie will not be appreciated by everybody.

OK, there is a difference between the truth and this story of course, but in the end you really can see many similarities. This is how the story goes The President is caught up in a sex scandal two weeks before the election and his spin doctor is brought in to fix things up. They decide to fake a war with Albania with the help of a Hollywood producer. They invent a story, start some rumors and studio footage is inserted into the news to create the illusion of a war, so the attention of the public is diverted away from the scandal. Of course things go wrong but time after time they know to make it work. I guess this movie will not be appreciated by everybody. I can imagine that most Bush adepts don't even understand the underlying message of the movie because even in reality they swallow whatever is served to them by the president's team of spin doctors. No, I guess it will be non-Americans like me and the Democratic voters that will see the humor in this movie. I know I had some good laughs and I reward it with an 8\/10. This should be seen by all Americans.

I actually had my reserveations, thinking what many of us here though at the timeHow can Coppola TOP the previous installments? He did not top them, but he certainly was VERY close. Several years passed and I bought the DVD trilogy, but before I could get to watch GODFATHER III, some local TV channel aired it, and I couldn't help but watching it, albeit, not totally focused and incomplete. Somehow, the movie didn't grasp me this time around. A couple of days later I decided to watch it with my wife, on DVD and give it another chance. How wrong was I! The magic that unfolded when I first saw it came back like a hammer blow. I remembered something that I already knew You have to watch these films with total attention to fully appreciate them. The lack of continuous action packed scenes may discourage some people, but then again, when the action scenes appear, they are over the top. THE GODFATHER III is set some 16 years after the ending of GODFATHER II. Michael Corleone is still trying to make his empire, Legit and his desire to shed the blood of his enemies has greatly diminished. We get to see most of the original cast, although Tom hagan's character (played wonderfully in the first movies by Robert Duvall) is sadly absent. It's never mentioned, but it appears that he died during the 70's. Michaels two children are now young adults. Andy Garcia is introduced as Sonny Corleone's bastard son, Vincent Mancini. His performance has yet to be outdone by himself! He is simply superb as the future heir to the Corleone Empire. Michael, in his attempt to go legit, strikes a deal with immobiliare, the Vatican Bank. This deal will make the Corleones as respectable as the Rockefellers. As Michael tries to get this deal done, he faces new enemies who don't want him to run immobiliare. The circumstances force Michael to adopt his old Mafia Warfare tactics, although he does it hesitantly. THE GODFATHER III is just as complex and richly textured as the other two movies...even the film quality has that grainy aspect that makes you think it was really filmed fight after last picture. Al Pacino's performance is more subdued in this one, but that's because his character is an Old Mafioso looking to redeem himself. The anger and fury of young Michael is present in Vincent (Andy Garcia). The ending is tragic and while it not may please everyone (it leaves many lose ends in the air)it's decent finale to what's possibly the most highly revered film trilogy in history.
