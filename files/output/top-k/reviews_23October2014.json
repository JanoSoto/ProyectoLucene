I was seven at the time when I watched this but even then you can instantly tell just how poor this film is and the Rugrats movie is nothing like we see in the Rugrats TV series prior to this film. Sure the film has some good parts but mostly it was pretty ordinary and dull which is a shame considering how successful its TV show is and this movie basically put a massive dent on its show. Fortunately, the following Rugrats films is somewhat better but even those films did not even live up to expectations. So if you asked me Is it necessary and worth watching? I will say NO!

It was a giant risk, and really never payed off until the fan base grew over the past thirty two years. While the Michael Myers character is not in the film as everyone already knows, I truly believe this is one of the better films that is attached to this Halloween series. The following is my review of Halloween 3 Season of the Witch.The story was crafted by four different people. The original idea came from Nigel Kneale who later wanted his name removed from the production. John Carpenter and Debra Hill also had a hand in some of the ideas. In the end, the film was finally finished up by Tommy Lee Wallace, who actually ended up using sixty percent of the story that Kneale wrote. Wallace was not new to the Halloween series at this point, as he was the production designer and editor of the original Halloween film. He left the sequel, Halloween 2, because he did not like the story idea. This story is basically a giant corporation in a small farming town that has a bad idea that will come about on Halloween night. I frankly love this story that everyone I mentioned above was able to pull together. Sure there was no Michael Myers, but the story and execution was amazing in my opinion. When I first watched this movie many moons ago, I was disappointing that Michael was not in the film, and to this day it saddens me part three doesn't include the iconic character, but once you get past that, the film is one of the better films of the series. The original idea was to keep the Halloween name and make a new movie every year, but with a different story like we got in this film. That idea fell apart once this film was originally panned. Thankfully over the decades people came to their senses and appreciate this great film like I have. Even though Wallace will never get the fame that John Carpenter got, in my opinion he delivers a fantastic story.Tommy Lee Wallace also directed the film, and he really delivers that amazing 1980s style of film making. Nothing too flashy or overdone, but it draws you in with its looks. Filming on location in small towns really makes the film look even more creepy with those fantastic night scenes they use to love filming. With a new story, also came some new actors. The star of the film is Tom Atkins, along with co-star Stacey Nelkin. Both play off of each other nicely in the film. Dan O'Herlihy delivers a wonderful performance as the evil business owner. His performance is a joy to watch. With the hate that this film has received for so many years, it is finally nice to see all these actors get their glory for a great film they all came together and made. Even though some like to nitpick this film, I'm personally glad I didn't decide to give up on this film like some Halloween purists have. Overall, Tommy Lee Wallace delivers a great film that most Halloween and horror fans in general should love. Take off your blinders and tell yourself before the film that this is no Michael Myers film, and you should very much enjoy this film.John Carpenter and Alan Howarth are back scoring this Halloween film. While the score is different, that John Carpenter style of 1980s music is still in full swing. While many feel now that the usage of the Synthesizer was cheesy, and it may have been for that time the film was made, I truly feel using the Synthesizer was brilliant. The scoring has so much depth, and I love it as much as I love the scores for the first two Halloween films that Carpenter did. While I cannot say the score on this film tops the score on the original Halloween film, it might be the second best right next to Halloween 2.In closing, Halloween 3 Season of the Witch is a film that has been unfairly criticized for more than three decades, and just recently the fan base for the film is growing into what it should be. With the recent Blu-Ray special edition release of this film, hopefully a new generation of Halloween fans can watch the film for what it is, and enjoy all its greatness like I have. Do not listen to those who trash the film, as at the end of the day their hatred for the film comes down to the film not having Michael Myers in the film. That is simply not a good reason to trash such a great horror film.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 October 2014","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Halloween 3 is a special film for me as it showed the original creators of this franchise(John Carpenter and Debra hill) wanted to take a huge risk and branch out from the Michael Myers character.

It is no doubt a step down from Halloween 4, the previous film in the series, but it is a film that I can still somewhat enjoy here and there. The following is my review of Halloween 5 The Revenge of Michael Myers.The story this time around was written by Michael Jacobs, Dominique Othenin-Girard(also directed the film), and Shem Bitterman. The story in this film continues where part four laves off with Jamie attacking her step mother with a kitchen knife. Much like Michael killed his sister in the original film. After the flashback we fast forward to about exactly one year after the events of Halloween 4. In this film we find out that her step mother did not die, but only suffered some injuries from the attack. An added element to this Halloween film is that Jamie and her Uncle(Michael Myers) share a bound with each other. As Michael is killing people around Jamie, Jamie can feel the presence of Myers with each kill. Connected mentally if you will. I found this plot device to be rather dull and added nothing worth of value. Another added element was the man in black who appears in this film. We see him at the end of the film break Michael out of the prison. This is the first movie we see the Thorn symbol as well, and something that is further explained in the next Halloween movie. The story for the most part stays a good chilling film with some over the top gore at moments here and there. While I don't really enjoy some of the elements that were added, this film does sell the new elements pretty well, and things do come full circle in the next film. Overall, these three writers do a better than average job, although it could have been better.The film was directed by Dominique Othenin-Girard, who is known for such movies as After Darkness and the 1991 made for television movie Omen IV The Awakening. While his career never really took off, having done a Halloween movie will have his name remembered for the rest of time. Whether in a good or bad light, that is up to us movie fans. The film was directed very nicely with some very good thrills to it. While this film won't be noticed for being the best at keeping the audience scared the entire movie, it does have a nice chilling effect to it. The gore factor is once again turned up for this sequel, and most horror sequels in the 1980s tried to do. While I would say the gore factor is more than in Halloween 4, it still for the most part is not over the top. They try to suck you in with the idea of the kill in most of the deaths, which is something I do enjoy. The acting is once again somewhat bland like in Halloween 4, but Donald Pleasence is once again back to steal the show. This was his second to last time playing the role of Dr. Sam Loomis, and just having him back in this iconic role is more than enough reason to watch this film. Dominique Othenin-Girard won't be getting high praise from me like other directors in this series, but he does a passable job for the most part.Alan Howarth once again returns to mold the score of the classic original that John Carpenter created. Much like the score in part four, the score in this film is nothing to write home about. It adds that chilling effect that the original score added, but there is no risk taking by Howarth like he took on parts two and three. I cannot say the score is bad, and while there are some minor changes to the score over part four, there is nothing that I can call impressive or original like he has done with other sequels in this franchise.In closing, Halloween 5 The Revenge of Michael Myers won't be remembered as one of the best films of the franchise, and rightfully so, but in my opinion it is not the worst or near the bottom.

While I would say the gore factor is more than in Halloween 4, it still for the most part is not over the top. They try to suck you in with the idea of the kill in most of the deaths, which is something I do enjoy. The acting is once again somewhat bland like in Halloween 4, but Donald Pleasence is once again back to steal the show. This was his second to last time playing the role of Dr. Sam Loomis, and just having him back in this iconic role is more than enough reason to watch this film. Dominique Othenin-Girard won't be getting high praise from me like other directors in this series, but he does a passable job for the most part.Alan Howarth once again returns to mold the score of the classic original that John Carpenter created. Much like the score in part four, the score in this film is nothing to write home about. It adds that chilling effect that the original score added, but there is no risk taking by Howarth like he took on parts two and three. I cannot say the score is bad, and while there are some minor changes to the score over part four, there is nothing that I can call impressive or original like he has done with other sequels in this franchise.In closing, Halloween 5 The Revenge of Michael Myers won't be remembered as one of the best films of the franchise, and rightfully so, but in my opinion it is not the worst or near the bottom. Hardcore fans of the franchise like myself should get some enjoyment out of the installment, while viewers who aren't really big fans of the franchises might dislike the movie for the most part.6.5\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"23 October 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The following review will contain spoilers.Ten years after the events of the original Halloween, Michael Myers is back. This was the first Halloween film that starred Michael Myers in seven years, his previous appearance being in Halloween 2 in 1981. While I personally consider this film to be one of the better films following the original film, it is not without it's problems. The following is my review of Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myers.The story was written by four different credited writers. Alan B. McElroy, Benjamin Ruffner, Larry Rattner, and Dhani Lipsius all received writing credit for this film. When the idea of another Halloween film came about, studio heads asked John Carpenter and Debra Hill to write a script for the film. When their idea was turned down, both Hill and Carpenter sold their rights to the franchise to longtime series producer, Moustapha Akkad. Akkad wanted to take things back to the basics of the series, but other pieces were still added later on in the series. The story this time around is fairly basic, and a bit of a reach admittedly. Laurie Strode has died in a car crash, but her daughter(Jamie Lloyd) still lives. Her Uncle of course is Michael Myers and everyone knows where the story is going now. While the story plays out fairly nicely in this sequel, the ending is where the film sort of lost me. It implies that Jamie will follow in the footsteps of her Uncle, as she is seen attacking her step mother. While more is explained in the sequel to this film, this ending turns the overall rating of this film down a notch for me. Otherwise, I thought the efforts of these four writers were very good.The film was directed by Dwight H. Little, and this was one of his first major directing jobs. As I say above, this is one of my favorite sequels of the franchise as a whole, and it delivers some nice suspense. While nothing will top the effort of John Carpenter from the first film, Little's effort in this film is top notch for the genre, and fans of this series likely agree this is one of the better films in it. The gore and nudity seem to take a nice step backwards in comparison to the second movie, Halloween 2. While there is blood and nudity, the nudity level is very low. The gore factor is somewhat there in a few scenes, but it is nothing compared to what was shown in Halloween 2 or other major horror films in the 19080s. I personally like less gore as that is not what the original film intended. The actors who headline this film are of course acting legend Donald Pleasence, Ellie Cornell(Rachel), and first time full length movie actress Danielle Harris(Jamie). While the actors outside of Pleasence aren't anything impressive, I didn't find the acting to be bland in any way. Pleasence is of course a joy to see again playing Sam Loomis, even if he looks very old and weak in this film. Overall, Dwight H. Little delivers one of the better efforts of the series, even if I did find some story problems towards the end of the film.Alan Howarth is back once again molding the score that John Carpenter created in the original Halloween film. While Howarth's effort in previous sequels like Halloween 2 and Halloween 3 Season of the Witch were great in my opinion, we don't really see much of an effort to be different with the famous score in this film. I personally don't have a problem with that, as the original score adds so much depth to a Michael Myers film, but some originality would have been nice to see like we saw in his previous sequel efforts. In the end I don't hate his score for this film, it just simply is not as good as in other previous efforts in this series.In closing, Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myers is one of my favorite films in this series, and while I don't rate it as high as some of the previous films, I still really enjoy watching this film from time to time. Even though the story is a bit of a stretch, hardcore fans like myself still seem to mostly enjoy it, and newer fans to the series shouldn't bypass it.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 October 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The following review will contain spoilers.Ten years after the events of the original Halloween, Michael Myers is back.

With John Carpenter off doing other projects, first time full length film director Rick Rick Rosenthal took over for the legend John Carpenter. While Rosenthal is rarely remembered for this film, I personally hold the opinion that this Halloween movie is not only the best film that was made after the original Halloween, but one of the best sequel ever made. The following is my review of Halloween 2.John Carpenter and Debra Hill both returned to write this sequel. They sought out the idea to have the film continue exactly where the original film left off. While this story is hardly remembered for being original like the first film is, I still believe Hill and Carpenter delivered a fantastic story. A twist in this sequel was that we found out that Michael Myers had another sister, and her name was Laurie Strode. Some fans even to this day question the logic behind this twist, but considering the powers that be behind the cameras wanted a sequel, I found this plot device to be worked out rather nicely. While Carpenter and Hill will always be remember for the fantastic work they dished out on the first film, I truly hope that in the following decades that people do not forget their fine efforts for this amazing sequel.The film was directed by Rick Rosenthal, and this film was his first effort at directing a feature length film. While Rosenthal is clearly no John Carpenter, I truly believe Rosenthal delivered a fantastic sequel, with some nice scares, even though the nudity and gore factor was turned up a notch on this film. This film was released during the time the slasher sub-genre was really taking off with films like Friday the 13th. Films like that had constant nudity and a great deal of gory deaths scenes. While this sequel did turn those factors up, I don't believe it ever hit the level of a Friday the 13th film. The scares aren't as great in turn because the extra blood flow is actually trying to scare you a little more than the thought of the kill, like in the original film. While this pushes the film down in my opinion, it really doesn't hurt it much because it never reached that high level of gore like other franchises hit in the 1980s.Back from the first film, Jamie Lee Curtis is truly a delight to have back for this sequel. She turned out one heck of a performance in the original film, and this film wouldn't have been the same without her. Some many times horror films suffer from bland acting. Not in a film like this with Jamie Lee Curtis. As I mentioned above, her character has a big twist to her in this sequel. She finds out she is the sister of Michael Myers. Shocking twist that Jamie Lee handles amazingly and really sells it. Back to play his famous role of Dr. Sam Loomis, legend Donald Pleasence once again is playing this very important role. The fact that Pleasence agreed to make this sequel is a shock considering how big of an actor he was, an even bigger shock though is the fact that Pleasence did three more of these movies after part two, for a total of five movies. To play a character like this for an actor like Pleasence is something amazing. So many fans love what he did with the character of Sam Loomis, and to do this he is one of my favorite actors.So overall, Rick Rosenthal gets a big thumbs up in my opinion for his amazing work on this film. While his efforts cannot possibly top that of what John Carpenter did on the first film, he lays out a fantastic effort for this sequel.Alan Howarth was tasked to mold the score of the first film into this sequel, while John Carpenter was off doing other projects. At this time the sequel was being made Howarth was doing work with John Carpenter on Escape from New York. In the 1980s, John Carpenter was known for using Synthesizers in his scores because it was so easy to use. Well, Howarth used this technique in this sequel to mold the score and update it. While the original score by Carpenter will always be my favorite, this score has to be my second of the franchise. It just adds so much deep depth to the film. I cannot get enough of it. Alan Howarth was given the task of molding the score from the first film and giving it an update for this sequel, and in my opinion he did a fabulous job.In closing, Halloween 2 might be overlooked by some of the fans who aren't deep into this franchise like myself, and that is a shame. While it doesn't really hold as well as the original, it does a fantastic job of being an amazing sequel in the horror genre. Which are very rare in this genre. Those of us fans of this franchise mostly consider this sequel to be at least good and one of the better films of the series. Those who maybe never had interest in this film because they don't like sequels, well, I can honestly say you are missing out on one heck of a great film.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 October 2014","score":"","review":" The following review will contain spoilers.Three years after the original Halloween film was made, the powers that be behind the original classic wanted another film.

There had been a lot of partisan conflict pro and con over THE English PATIENT. It won no less than ten Oscars&#x99; including Best Picture. Yet there were some who complained bitterly. There was an episode of Seinfeld where Elaine grows exasperated at her friends and colleagues mooning over the film to the point where her boss insists on taking her to see the film and while he sits there teary eyed she squirms in her seat and just shouts out Die already!Everyone is aghast at Elaine's reaction as they sit teary eyed, overwhelmed by the romance. But what is the romance? It's nothing more than our old friend infidelity, except here it's clothed in the veddy veddy colonial carryings on in Cairo and the western desert in the period before WW2. Falling in love by campfire light while reading Herodotus. Oh please. It reminds me of love scenes in movies where we're assured that it all takes place on 800 thread count sheets. It's making love. I always seem to hear the gravelly voice of Henry Miller saying, Don't you mean f**king?Of course the story is told in flashbacks. Now usually flashbacks are a narrative devise used to reveal the plot non-sequentially. But here the use of flashbacks is merely to draw out this basic story of infidelity and revenge for more than two hours. It's like one of those $500 hamburgers. It's got wagyu beef and truffles but it's still a hamburger.If it were taking place in a Bronx tenement it would all be over in half an hour. It would be just another double murder\/suicide. But with everybody downing gin and tonics at the club and a bit of the old scholars shuffle in colonial offices, it presents a certain retro romanticism (at least as far as furnishings and accessories go) which is beyond the experience of the audience but which they want to believe existed. I've been to these places and people are so bored that adultery is the rule rather than the exception. There's nothing else to do but to screw each other's wives and when that grows tiresome to have a bash at the local brothels. A steady flow of tourists is a bit too much to be hoped for.Tits and ass with class Lenny Bruce would call it. This drawing things out reminds me of reality TV or the quiz programs which tease before they say the answer is right and we'll get to see something we're promised after some adverts. This is why Elaine became so frustrated.Of course the action, while filled with incident, is patently absurd. First of all, it doesn't pass my Lady Bracknell test. One suicide by bi-plane can only be regarded as a misfortune. But two suicides by bi-plane suggests carelessness. Just a little gold flake on our burger.Then there's the part where our hero walks three days through the desert to bring back some help for his love that he leaves battered and bleeding in a cave. He finally makes it to the British outpost. Somehow in between the first bi-plane suicide and our hero's arrival WW2 has broken out and instead of raising the alarm and getting help for his lady love, he is interned. The interment is done by a sergeant major. Now they may be the backbone of the British Army but they do not have the authority to arrest and intern people willy-nilly. If someone walked into town from the desert and there was anything suspicious about him, he would have to be debriefed by Intelligence, which would have meant he would have been interrogated by an officer. Once he met an officer they would have matched up friends in Cairo and help would be on the way.The fact that he had a foreign name would have meant little because obviously he was a gentleman. There was a similar incident in WW I where a British spy was found in the Sinai with the name Meinertzhagen and he turned out to be a British Officer (see the incident in The Lighthorsemen). So, no British Sergeant Major was likely to assume the authority of an officer in interning a foreign gentleman whatever his name or nationality was.But OK, lets move on.When our hero is interred and escapes it's the first days of the war. The Afrika Korps arrived in early 1941. What had he been doing until then? He delivers his maps to them in exchange for a bi-plane that had previously been squirreled away. Hadn't he returned to the cave in the year and a half of freedom? So he too smashes into the desert with horrible burns. He is rescued and brought to a British medical unit.Now this gets me. Instead of sending him on to an equipped hospital in Tobruk or Alexandria or Cairo even, they schlepp him through the loss of Tobruk, the victory at El Alamein, the landings in Sicily, the fight up the Italian boot to wind up in Florence (champagne for the burger?). He's a burn patient after all and they hold on to them moving him around from battle to battle for four years. Not sending him to a hospital. Seems a bit incredible. Seems insane.Thus the other reason for the flashback structure&#x96;time makes no sense here. On the Wikipedia page for the novel it's categorized as meta fiction. I know Borges was able to freeze a bullet in time to give a philosopher about to be executed time to finish his work. But that was exactly what the story was about. Here time means nothing. It's just something to be dipped into to supply incident and drama. Its crudely manipulative, exposed by its distortion of any logic, by its deliberate defiance of verisimilitude.

Falling in love by campfire light while reading Herodotus. Oh please. It reminds me of love scenes in movies where we're assured that it all takes place on 800 thread count sheets. It's making love. I always seem to hear the gravelly voice of Henry Miller saying, Don't you mean f**king?Of course the story is told in flashbacks. Now usually flashbacks are a narrative devise used to reveal the plot non-sequentially. But here the use of flashbacks is merely to draw out this basic story of infidelity and revenge for more than two hours. It's like one of those $500 hamburgers. It's got wagyu beef and truffles but it's still a hamburger.If it were taking place in a Bronx tenement it would all be over in half an hour. It would be just another double murder\/suicide. But with everybody downing gin and tonics at the club and a bit of the old scholars shuffle in colonial offices, it presents a certain retro romanticism (at least as far as furnishings and accessories go) which is beyond the experience of the audience but which they want to believe existed. I've been to these places and people are so bored that adultery is the rule rather than the exception. There's nothing else to do but to screw each other's wives and when that grows tiresome to have a bash at the local brothels. A steady flow of tourists is a bit too much to be hoped for.Tits and ass with class Lenny Bruce would call it. This drawing things out reminds me of reality TV or the quiz programs which tease before they say the answer is right and we'll get to see something we're promised after some adverts. This is why Elaine became so frustrated.Of course the action, while filled with incident, is patently absurd. First of all, it doesn't pass my Lady Bracknell test. One suicide by bi-plane can only be regarded as a misfortune. But two suicides by bi-plane suggests carelessness. Just a little gold flake on our burger.Then there's the part where our hero walks three days through the desert to bring back some help for his love that he leaves battered and bleeding in a cave. He finally makes it to the British outpost. Somehow in between the first bi-plane suicide and our hero's arrival WW2 has broken out and instead of raising the alarm and getting help for his lady love, he is interned. The interment is done by a sergeant major. Now they may be the backbone of the British Army but they do not have the authority to arrest and intern people willy-nilly. If someone walked into town from the desert and there was anything suspicious about him, he would have to be debriefed by Intelligence, which would have meant he would have been interrogated by an officer. Once he met an officer they would have matched up friends in Cairo and help would be on the way.The fact that he had a foreign name would have meant little because obviously he was a gentleman. There was a similar incident in WW I where a British spy was found in the Sinai with the name Meinertzhagen and he turned out to be a British Officer (see the incident in The Lighthorsemen). So, no British Sergeant Major was likely to assume the authority of an officer in interning a foreign gentleman whatever his name or nationality was.But OK, lets move on.When our hero is interred and escapes it's the first days of the war. The Afrika Korps arrived in early 1941. What had he been doing until then? He delivers his maps to them in exchange for a bi-plane that had previously been squirreled away. Hadn't he returned to the cave in the year and a half of freedom? So he too smashes into the desert with horrible burns. He is rescued and brought to a British medical unit.Now this gets me. Instead of sending him on to an equipped hospital in Tobruk or Alexandria or Cairo even, they schlepp him through the loss of Tobruk, the victory at El Alamein, the landings in Sicily, the fight up the Italian boot to wind up in Florence (champagne for the burger?). He's a burn patient after all and they hold on to them moving him around from battle to battle for four years. Not sending him to a hospital. Seems a bit incredible. Seems insane.Thus the other reason for the flashback structure&#x96;time makes no sense here. On the Wikipedia page for the novel it's categorized as meta fiction. I know Borges was able to freeze a bullet in time to give a philosopher about to be executed time to finish his work. But that was exactly what the story was about. Here time means nothing.

It's entirely possible that I'm simply setting my standard way too high, and getting annoyed when these movies don't fulfill the criteria I've set for a movie in the Halloween franchise.Anyway, on to this one, the sixth installment, which explains a bit more about the mysterious man clad in black that we saw glimpses of in the previous movie. Not a whole lot is explained other than that they're experimenting with pure evil, and Jamie's baby, who is born on Halloween, plays an important part, in the movie, and for this cult.I'm no longer going to demand goreless killings. The precise Myers is long gone, and the current Myers is all about using whatever he can get his hands on, as well as the surroundings, to take care of business. He still has his patented kitchen knife every know and then, but flashy is the new silent, and Myers at least does that well.This movie however, goes over the top. The cult really adds nothing to the story. It could've been good, but it suffers from a complete lack of backstory, and while it's important for the story to progress, the fact that it is so unbelievable and that very little is actually explained about the cult and its members makes it come off as a bad joke.The movie kicks off with Jamie and her newborn child being saved from the cult by a lady that took pity in her. Jamie makes it to a public bus station with her baby, where she manages to get on air with a radio station covering the Myers murders, calling for help from Loomis. Myers does eventually catch up to her, ending her in a spectacular fashion, but she manages to hide the baby before it happens.The cult wants this child, and Tommy Doyle, the kid Laurie babysat in the original Halloween, takes it on himself to protect the baby, as well as Danny and Kara Strode. Danny has somehow gotten some sort of connection with Myers from sleeping in his room, so he's also of interest to the cult.

That's not all that surprising when you consider it's not an original Nolan work but a remake of an earlier Norwegian film. What also should not be surprising is that even a lesser Christopher Nolan film is still a really good film. The guy doesn't make bad movies. Insomnia may lack the uniqueness of his original works. But this movie still has a compelling story to tell. And Nolan is more than up to the challenge of delivering that story in a fashion which is both entertaining and thought-provoking.The story centers around Los Angeles police detective Will Dormer who along with his partner has traveled to a small Alaskan town to assist with a murder investigation. Dormer is a notably famous cop, a hero, but left behind in Los Angeles is an internal affairs investigation which threatens to undo his life's work. As he lands in Alaska this weighs heavily on his mind. And things are about to get a whole lot worse. In the course of hunting down the Alaskan killer Dormer makes a huge, catastrophic mistake. If discovered this error really will bring Dormer's life crashing down. Crucially none of the Alaskan police he works with know what he has done. Unfortunately for Dormer one person does know the killer. And now the killer sees himself as Dormer's partner. They're going to help one another get away with their respective misdeeds. Wracked by guilt, in a terrible moral quandary, what will Dormer do? He really is in a terrible state, made much worse by the fact he can't sleep at all. What's really keeping him awake? Is it the perpetual Alaskan sunlight? Or is it his own guilty conscience?The role of Dormer is pretty much perfect for Al Pacino who brings both a sense of authority and a great weariness to the role. Dormer, successful though he may be, is really being beaten down by life and up in Alaska things are only getting worse. The guy is crumbling and Pacino captures that very well. The other key performance comes from Robin Williams who shows up halfway through the film inhabiting a character who is quite unlike anything you'd expect from this particular actor. The film provides a chance for Williams to show off some serious acting chops and he delivers. Pacino and Williams play off one another brilliantly, the tension between their two characters is palpable and it drives the film forward. Hilary Swank has an important role as well, playing a young Alaskan police officer who idolizes Dormer but who does a little digging and realizes there may be some very bad things the famous detective has hidden away. To what lengths will Dormer go to protect those dangerous secrets? That is the crux of this film's plot. It's not your typical good guy\/bad guy story. The lines between good and bad are not just blurred, they're completely wiped away. It's a smart story which really grabs you. And the film is photographed beautifully. The light might be forever shining but there is true darkness lurking here. Story, performances, photography...everything comes together very well. Even in a film which is not nearly his best effort Christopher Nolan produces something quite excellent.

Hilary Swank has an important role as well, playing a young Alaskan police officer who idolizes Dormer but who does a little digging and realizes there may be some very bad things the famous detective has hidden away. To what lengths will Dormer go to protect those dangerous secrets? That is the crux of this film's plot. It's not your typical good guy\/bad guy story. The lines between good and bad are not just blurred, they're completely wiped away. It's a smart story which really grabs you. And the film is photographed beautifully. The light might be forever shining but there is true darkness lurking here. Story, performances, photography...everything comes together very well.

That's not all that surprising when you consider it's not an original Nolan work but a remake of an earlier Norwegian film. What also should not be surprising is that even a lesser Christopher Nolan film is still a really good film. The guy doesn't make bad movies. Insomnia may lack the uniqueness of his original works. But this movie still has a compelling story to tell. And Nolan is more than up to the challenge of delivering that story in a fashion which is both entertaining and thought-provoking.The story centers around Los Angeles police detective Will Dormer who along with his partner has traveled to a small Alaskan town to assist with a murder investigation. Dormer is a notably famous cop, a hero, but left behind in Los Angeles is an internal affairs investigation which threatens to undo his life's work. As he lands in Alaska this weighs heavily on his mind. And things are about to get a whole lot worse. In the course of hunting down the Alaskan killer Dormer makes a huge, catastrophic mistake. If discovered this error really will bring Dormer's life crashing down. Crucially none of the Alaskan police he works with know what he has done. Unfortunately for Dormer one person does know the killer. And now the killer sees himself as Dormer's partner. They're going to help one another get away with their respective misdeeds. Wracked by guilt, in a terrible moral quandary, what will Dormer do? He really is in a terrible state, made much worse by the fact he can't sleep at all. What's really keeping him awake? Is it the perpetual Alaskan sunlight? Or is it his own guilty conscience?The role of Dormer is pretty much perfect for Al Pacino who brings both a sense of authority and a great weariness to the role. Dormer, successful though he may be, is really being beaten down by life and up in Alaska things are only getting worse. The guy is crumbling and Pacino captures that very well. The other key performance comes from Robin Williams who shows up halfway through the film inhabiting a character who is quite unlike anything you'd expect from this particular actor. The film provides a chance for Williams to show off some serious acting chops and he delivers. Pacino and Williams play off one another brilliantly, the tension between their two characters is palpable and it drives the film forward. Hilary Swank has an important role as well, playing a young Alaskan police officer who idolizes Dormer but who does a little digging and realizes there may be some very bad things the famous detective has hidden away.

I had always been a little curious to see it due to its great cast, but I was also aware of its infamy as a disastrous production. I've always gotten the impression that this is a universally hated film. Wanting to see it for myself and form my own opinion, I finally decided to give the movie a chance, admittedly having fairly low expectations. I guess I should mention that I know next to nothing about the H.G. Wells novel, and this film is the only adaptation of the story that I have seen. Anyway, I found it to be a pleasant little surprise! Before explaining why I enjoyed this movie, let me tell all you potential viewers something don't expect a Jurassic Park level film. I mentioned before that there are some really great actors in this movie. It's none of their finest work by a long shot. But who would expect these things going into this film, especially given its reputation? This is a movie where you just turn your brain off and appreciate what it has to offer. For one, it's well-acted. Brando is so ridiculous in this movie that it's great. Kilmer gives a vibrant performance, Thewlis is good, as are Ron Perlman and Temuera Morrison in their creature roles. And the creature effects are fantastic! Probably my favorite aspect of the movie. Bravo to Stan Winston, he was a master of his craft. I had no idea before seeing his name in the opening credits that he was a part of this film. Honestly, I expected some Spawn-level CGI in this movie, given the time it came out. There is one small scene with some pretty terrible CG effects done for some smaller creatures, but all of the other creatures are done wonderfully with full make-up and prosthetics. Of course, this movie does deserve some criticism. It has its flaws for sure. For instance, the script is nothing special, and the movie gets heavy-handed at points. Its not award winning material, but it's still a very fun watch. Don't let the overwhelming criticism of this movie scare you away! Give it a chance! You might like it. I would definitely recommend for fans of practical effects work and schlocky sci-fi to see it.

From a political point of view it just hawks about the familiar worn-out stereotypes. If you like to deepen your political insights, this is not the film for you. However, the film also contains the delightful love story between Louise Bryant and John Reed - in the fantasy of the script writers. It is definitely worth while to watch this struggle between two very independent minds, who increasingly become to value their mutual relationship and company. It is not a cohabitation for the sake of the cats. Nevertheless, since politics is my real thing, I shall confine my comments to the historical scenes. At the start of the twentieth century politics was a mess. The democracy was anything but accepted as the best political system, not even in Europe. As a consequence of the failing liberal system (robber barons etcetera), there was a large support for unsound ideas like revolutionary socialism (Leninism), anarchism and fascism. This relative chaos had an enormous pull on intellectual adventurers, who believed that they could supply the right left-wing answers. Often they advocated a system of workers councils (which obviously does not work). To be fair, I know nothing about John Reed. But his case is very similar to Karl Radek (present in the film), and Dutch revolutionaries like Anton Pannekoek and Herman Gorter (should have been present). The normal system had failed so miserably, that their weird visions could gain some acceptance. Unlike the opportunist Lenin they were individualists, dogmatists and fanatics. This explains why Reed radicalizes he starts as a supporter of president Wilson and the AFL, joins the IWW, forms his own socialist sect, and ends his life in Soviet Russia. He just can not settle. Abandon the search for truth, settle for a good fantasy. The script shows how Reed exclaims to Radek (or was it Zinoviev?) Individualism is the true source of rebellion! This libertarian stance is hard to reconcile with his socialist sympathies. Sure, you are unique, just like anyone else. In addition the film suggests that in his last days Reed distances himself from the revolution. He even tries to stop a charge of Red soldiers. This is stupendous, for in his actual final articles he still glorifies the Red Army. In such moments Reds does not stand to reason and seems to work on liberal propaganda. Having said that, the general picture remains credible. The interludes with real old acquaintances of Bryant and Reed repair some of the flaws in the script. They display how the common Russian people were misled in order to satisfy the lust for power of a ruthless party. This may be old news, but should not be forgotten.

In this respect, Dumbo is similar to the films The Elephant Man or Roxanne.The saddest scene in the film, to me, was when Dumbo was ripped away from his mother Mrs. Jumbo. The most touching part of the film. Dumbo was very lucky to find a good friend Timothy Q. Mouse.

I laugh so hard especially the scene when the Man in Black is trying to climb up The Cliffs of Insanity without the rope and Montoya tried to rush him because he cannot wait to kill him and the torture scene when the Count trying to get a survey from Westley (I mean who does that? But it works). From that point on things got crazy. The Princess is beautiful and Westley is amazing with his as you wish romanticism and charming gaze. The bond between the boy, played by Savage, and his grandfather is sweet and almost comedic especially about the kissing scenes. Overall, the story is very funny and I think it catches the attention of many people despite its ridiculous story line like reviving Westley that mostly dead. The characters are all funny and I can't stop laughing and I'm going to watch it again in a few seconds.Watch this with your kids and friends.

Her father forbids her to go to the carnival which had a couple of bodies found last year. She's on a first date with gas jockey Buzz Dawson. He's a bad boy who insists on going to the carnival. They don't get off on the right foot. He picks up his friends Liz and Richie. Meanwhile, Joey sneaks out to go to the carnival by himself. Richie has the idea to spend the night in the funhouse ride. Joey waits for the group to leave the funhouse. The group witnesses the brutal murder of the psychic.As early slasher movies go, this is not the worst but I wouldn't recommend it. The young lead actors aren't that compelling. To be kind, they are amateurish and annoying. Other the Amy, I don't mind if any of them die. There isn't much of a story. The first half is pretty dull, but the carnival is pretty sleazy and creepy. I do like the amateur creepiness. It feels like an authentic bad small-town traveling carnival. As the kids start running for their lives, the movie gets somewhat better. But the movie is still pretty boring. Director Tobe Hooper has done better before and after this. This is not one of his best. ","genre":null},{"date":"23 October 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Amy Harper has a bratty younger brother Joey.
