But, whereas most people know him for his Horror movies, the first movies I think of when I think of John Carpenter is this one and ones like it. Like all of his early movies, the plot is very slow-moving and unfolds at a realistic pace. No shiny explosions or million-dollar special effects here. Only exactly what's needed to get the point across and no more. And to match the movies pace, the soundtrack is in the same repetitive, slow-moving, ambient mood as that from Precinct 13 or Dark Star. The plot is pretty clever. The idea being that we are all slaves of the aliens that have taken over the planet, and all the rich and the powerful either are aliens or have sold out to them. The thing that intrigues me most about this movie is the contrast between its slow moving plot and its genre, combatting an alien invasion. Often the subject of action computer games, this treatment of that plot idea actually only has a few fight scenes, and even they don't seem to rank up there with your standard action movies. Sure, there's guns blazing, but there's not much running around, dodging bullets. Most of the gun-fights look like something you'd see on the streets of LA more than an action movie. And I think that's the point. A paranoid-schizophrenic's view of the world. Taking the violence and hatred in the world and blaming it on, not just the aliens, but human nature's own tendency to follow them. Of course, this movie also has some of the best one-liners in movie history.

Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn are at their very best, and Tim Robbins' direction is great. What is perhaps most impressive is that it tackles one of the most complicated and controversial political issues of the day with startling intelligence for a Hollywood movie.Sean Penn plays Matthew Poncelet, a man on death row for the murder of two teenagers. Susan Sarandon plays  Helen Prejean, a nun committed to helping Poncelet accept his responsibility for the crime and die with dignity.This movie stands out among prison movies because, as the chaplain tells Sister Helen, there's none of that he's innocent, he just needs someone to believe him stuff. Unlike in other prison movies, no attempt is made to absolve the wrongdoer of guilt. Helen only tries to convince people that he doesn't deserve to die. This is a refreshing approach for a movie, especially since the friend crusading to prove wrongfully-accused man's innocence persona is so overdone in many movies. Tim Robbins' script does an excellent job of keeping Poncelet from becoming a martyr figure; there are no excuses made for his crimes,  and his own foolishness is shown by all the racist remarks he makes to the press. Poncelet is a complicated character, but Penn does an excellent job playing him and Robbins shows him in just the right light.Now, onto the politics of the film. First of all, many people can't figure out if this movie is pro-death penalty or anti-death penalty. It's neither. Asking if the movie is for or against the death penalty is too broad a question. Instead, we should ask does the film give the sense that Poncelet deserves to die? Does the film give the sense that justice was done? Did Poncelet deserve to be loved? Does Poncelet's death make up for his victims'.I think the film says that Poncelet does deserve the death penalty. When I see the execution scene, I don't see a great injustice. How can you see injustice in this scene when the camera cuts several times to a flashback of Poncelet raping and killing? I should add, though, that I still found the execution abhorrent the way they kill him, like they're putting an animal to sleep, is just unnerving. I also think that the film says Poncelet deserves to be loved over and over Sarandon points out that Poncelet is still human, and every human deserves love. I also think the film doesn't tell us that Poncelet's death makes up for his crime, but it does say that his death makes him worthy of forgiveness.While the movie is not very favorable towards capital punishment, I think there is no question that Poncelet's execution is treated as a just punishment (however terrible), and so it cannot be called entirely anti- capital punishment. Personally, I am vehemently against the death penalty because even though there may be some disgusting, despicable, horrible people who deserve to die, I would not trust anyone's judgment (including my own) as to _who_ deserves to dies and who doesn't.  Also, courts are absurdly reluctant to stop executions (even if the prisoner is still sentenced to life without parole). The death penalty is utterly final and irrevocable -- should we trust its administration to such flawed beings as ourselves?Dead Man Walking gets 9\/10.P.S.

Also, courts are absurdly reluctant to stop executions (even if the prisoner is still sentenced to life without parole). The death penalty is utterly final and irrevocable -- should we trust its administration to such flawed beings as ourselves?Dead Man Walking gets 9\/10.P.S.

Leaving the cinema on a hot summer night, I recognised a strange smile amongst the males that exited with their satisfied but less than impressed girlfriends, the kids, boy or girl did not have this almost uniform smirk either. The men, who have grown up on STAR WARS, INDIANA JONES and BOND, seemed to recognise something they'd long been missing. I can only describe it as akin to the feeling explicated at the end of FIELD OF DREAMS by James Earl Jones. It may not of had the John Woo inspired chaos, or the Bruckenhiemer orange filtered cool, it lacked the set in stone star power machismo of a Mel, Bruce or Nic, and it wasn't plagued with a critical case of referential irony. While I certainly enjoy all these in a movie (except the latter as you might have guessed) X-Men had something the blockbusters of late had lost in the brew or just plain didn't care about. It had a story, it had characters, it had ideas and best of all it wanted to present them as well and as intelligently as the summer action seat filler would allow. This was the reason we went to see JAWS all those years before high concept was branded on the arse of every piece of cinematic entertainment. Sure the shark was cool, we went to see the effects and the action and jokes, but what made us buy another ticket, what made us recommend it to our friends, what made us queue around the block for a third viewing, what made us hum the theme tune in the local lido, what made us watch it on TV, video and DVD year in, year out? I'll tell you what; an incredible piece of story telling with characters who actually seem like people as opposed to archetypes from other films. And in recent years the most we could hope for is the star gets some choice wisecracks and the action is half as exciting as it was in the trailer. Comparing and contrasting with recent examples is a futile exercise. The two most successful blockbusters of last summer, THE MATRIX and THE PHANTOM MENACE, don't deserve as near as much the adulation they received and continue to gain. They both suffer from the same problems that the X-MEN miraculously lacks. They both set up over-complicated plots. The essential premise is understandable from the trailer but they still find it necessary to bog the section after the opening action sequence down with an hour of exposition. THE MATRIX for all it camera tricks and location changes essentially has Lawrence Fishburne lay down the plot for over forty minute of cleverly shot talking heads. Where is the spectacle in that? STAR WARS I is crippled by even worse pacing and expositional problems. It needs to set up all the characters for the next two films but also have a story within this one. So while all the future relationships get their first meeting scene, it's hard to feel excited about any of the paths joining as that's all that happens. For a film that opens with standard rolling introduction titles to brining us up to date, all we basically chalk up for the following two hours is movie of scene setting for later installments. Yes, Obi Wan and Annakin do meet but little occurs between them, the same can be said for the mother of his future children. As Andrew O'Hehir concluded in his report at the time of its release, ` &#133;This installment feels less like an opening chapter than a stammering, parenthetical preface.' X-MEN should ail with same defect. It is the opening part of a franchise and worse still has thirty years worth of idolised comics to condense into two hours. Unlike BATMAN which not only had huge audience recognition from non-comic readers due to the camp TV series and only one lead to introduce, X-MEN has a diverse cast to acquaint as well as a world that is obviously different from ours despite parallels. To deal with the huge roll call of introductions the scripting team of Tom De Santo, Singer and credited writer, David Hayter, have gone for what I'll call the Star Wars approach (A New Hope, that is.) Establish one character and then have them promptly meet up with everyone needed on his quest. In the same way Luke Skywalker briskly picks up the droids, the sage, the pirate, the muscle and the plucky heroine on his journey he also has plenty of adventures on the way, culminating in one big dénouement. This way the plot is peppered with action that effects the proceedings and all the characters are introduced both in time to have purpose in the last act but also for future episodes. The mission still propels the story but it also requires that the whole gang is assembled. X-MEN follows Rouge and Wolverine as they discover who they are, what their powers are and what their place in society is. Like the hierarchy set up in Star Wars where the characters understanding of the mystical force sets the characters social standing, here the more control a character has of their mutation the higher their ranking in the group. Clasical actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen take the roles of leaders of each side but also the Alec Guinness' role in Star Wars of swiftly explaining the complicated mythology in simple but legendary sounding terms. Here mythology is replaced with political import. The science introduction that hears Stewart booming about evolution and mutation should, if the producers have any sense become the regular opening for all entry in the series but apart from that most of the old hands speechifying is used to show their strange relation. Singer far prefers to show everything visually. Whether it be Wolverine's ability to smell danger, Cyclops' power, people prejudices of mutants or what Magneto's doom machine does. By keeping dialouge for character as opposed to signaling plot changes we have a far quicker, fluid reality created.In nearly all press interviews Singer has explained what drew him to the project he knew little about was the comparison to Malcolm X and Martin Luther King. We sense that Magneto and Xaiver have history merely from the casting. When Magneto, says `By any means necessary,' this doesn't seem like clumsy misuse of a historical slogan or tacking on importance via historical events. Taking events were people lost lives to add verisimilitude is probably the hardest (and half-witted) thing to achieve as a director, Spielberg can be hit and miss and James Cameron's focus on a pair of stroppy teen in TITANIC was insulting. X-MEN uses it's history deftly; Ellis Island, Civil Rights, Gun Control, McCarthyism and most risky of all Nazi concentration camps work together as evidence to supports the reality these mutants live in. X-MEN is probably the most distinct cinematic allegory since HIGH NOON. It's subject is political intolerance. It's brave and skillful inclusion of a tragedy like the holocaust to open the film, setting out its stall not as merely popcorn fodder but as a piece more interested in a human side than car chases. It wants to show how these characters developed their ideals not their powers. Magneto is presented as someone so obsessed with equality he's willing to turn everyone into someone like him. Interestingly, the starting point to this particular battle is a vote grabbing Senator who is riding on people's fears to pass a witch hunt law against mutants. After Magneto's plan fails, one of his hench mutants actually disguises herself as the now dead Senator and turns the vote around. How's that for two opposing side causing moderation? The bad guys actually stop the bill because the good guys stopped their far more nefarious scheme. It's a more pertinent message on modern living than `We need guns. Lots of guns.' Nearly every blockbuster of the last decade has been as flawed, so it really is unfair to pick on the Wachowskis' and Lucas's successes to this extent apart from the fact they've had such special treatment compared to everyone else. X-MEN earned a favourable review and an in depth article by Kim Newman in film magazine of record Sight and Sound. Newman's piece however was concerned with the process it took to get the film from the funny-book into the can and the review still felt like it was selling tickets as opposed actually judging whether the film would have any after life apart from sequels. This is the cackhanded way all Hollywood summer juggernauts are brushed aside by the university degree press, and Sight and Sound is more than guilty of this. Perhaps this will go some way to redressing the balance. These movies are the most watched, have the most effect on the economics of the movie business and really do make or break careers. The fact that Singer has once again proven himself to be the master storyteller, as he did with The USUAL SUSPECTS, and made a movie that displays all the merits of big budget entertainment should be of note enough. The fact that it could have more import than a thousand worthy documentaries on modern day prejudices should be celebrated.

Can it possibly get any worse than it has been already? In truth, it will probably get better as we now move into Oscar Season.And here is the first major film contending for Oscars, already touted by many a critic as one of the best, if not the best, film of the year. It is possible that it will pick up some. I myself am praying to God that it is entirely ignored. Well, mostly ignored, because there is at least one decently Oscar-worthy performance in the film. But most of it is medium-par Hollywood filmmaking at its best. At its worse, it is a sitcom.Okay, let me do a pros vs cons list for Almost FamousPros Okay, the one very good performance in this movie belongs to Billy Crudup (playing a rock guitarist named Russell Hammond). I have never seen him in a movie before, but I commend him to the utmost for bringing the character of Ashitaka to life in the corrupted American version of the Japanese animated masterpiece Princess Mononoke. In Almost Famous, he is probably the most fully developed character, even more fully developed than the film's two main characters, William Miller (Patrick Fugit) and Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). Crudup is the only actor in the cast who is capable of being funny without trying to look like he is funny. He emits an aura of apathy, as his character requires, in a very natural and believable manner. The only scene in the film which attains greatness, the only scene which is not going to be out of my mind entirely by the time I go to bed tonight, is the one where Russell, sick with the way the band is going, goes to the house of some Topeka teenagers who are having a party. I won't give the scene away, since it is the best scene of the movie, but it is amazing. It works both dramatically and, especially, it is successful as comedy. Other highpoints in the movie...well, there aren't all that many. It sometimes has a nice mood to it, but there was always something coming up to ruin it. There were a lot of great songs, but they were poorly used. Oh yeah, Phillip Seymour Hoffman was in it and he was great, but he had too few scenes, so he in no way could save the movie.Okay, well, it seems that I've already gotten into the cons, so let me proceed  with them SPOILER ALERT Poorly judged comedic moments were frequent. A groupie, oh, sorry, Band-Aide, is running after the tour bus to tell William something, and she crashes into another bus when running. This isn't a slapstick comedy, so this scene just shouldn't have been in here. That had to have hurt a lot, and we should be aware of that, even though I'm willing to bet that nobody in the audience was. Francis McDormand, often a great actress, just see Fargo or Blood Simple or Mississippi Burning, is extremely annoying as an unbelievably insane mother. There are many moments involving her character which are supposed to be funny, but just ended up making me cringe with discomfort. The only scene where humor involving her character succeeds is when she talks to Russell Hammond on the telephone, and that scene is only very successful because of Crudup's good performance. And the single biggest misstep of the entire movie was the scene where the band's plane gets caught in a storm, everyone thinks they are going to die. So what do they do? I bet you've already guessed that they start to tell each other truths. Oh yes, where have I seen this before? Perhaps the last episode of Seinfeld, but it has been done many times before that. Patrick Fugit has a nice moment where he accuses the band of having used Penny Lane. It happens during a scene which could potentially ruin the movie, so that speech does a little to save the scene. But Crowe thought he just had to top it off with the drummer confessing that he's gay. Wow, that had to take some genius to write. Then of course, the second he screams that, the pilot opens the cockpit door and says, Don't worry folks, everything's going to be okay! And, if you have any insight into the natural artificiality of the film world in the first place, you'll notice how much of a set the airplane is in the first place.Lots of name-dropping. Every two minutes, someone is screaming, Hey, there's David Bowie or Robert Plant is on the second floor or Black Sabbath is going to be here tonight or Bob Dylan sat down with us last night. Of course, they don't appear in the movie (well, the tambourine player from Humble Pie does). They couldn't. We know what Bob Dylan looked like in 1973. They couldn't have gotten an actor to play him successfully, and of course they could never have gotten away with a cheap Forrest Gump technique of inserting celebrities into their movie. So what does this name dropping do for the picture? It becomes distracting, and thus harms greatly the pacing.Performances well, this is perhaps the biggest category. Only the two leads need to be discussed. Patrick Fugit is a newcomer, and he is the very main character, so his performance is what makes the film. Well, he's not terrible, but he's certainly not up to it. His main problem is that his face has only one expression insanely happy. Oh, those dimples! He's a very warm person to look at when his character is supposed to be happy. But when it is supposed to be anything else, I just couldn't accept him. When he chooses to tell Penny Lane the truth near the end of the film, he has to be a little cruel, but the performance cracks here.Okay, the biggest failure of the film is the acting, character, and the whole situation involving Penny Lane. The acting first off Kate Hudson is a complete bimbo. Okay, so her character was, too. But when they tried to give her depth, it never worked, because Kate Hudson has no depth. Of course, many a teenage boy is going to go to bed thinking of her after they have seen this movie, but the script required more depth from her than she could produce. She deserves porn, no more. My suggestion would have been to switch Hudson with Anna Paquin, an Oscar winner at the age of 11, who played another Band Aide. She was absent for a while, but she came back earlier this year with the best performance in X-Men, although the movie failed generally. She would have brought much more depth to Penny Lane. Of course, a blond was needed, because that is what sells.Now, the whole Band Aide situation was horribly misogynistic. It does happen, surely, but Crowe is attempting to justify it throughout the film. Oh, they aren't just, how do I put this delicately, free hookers. Groupies, we're informed, just want to sleep with someone famous. Band Aides are fans, and because they are fans, they help the band. With what, besides to boost their egoes? Crowe tries to have William Miller defend Penny's honor, but that theme never goes anywhere. He never seems sufficiently offended at what they are doing, the band or the hookers. At the end, the whole situation still basically seems acceptable. Of course, if Cameron Crowe actually did have the orgy with the three band aides as his effigy did in the film, I can see why he is not offended. Of course, that scene is lifted straight out of pornography anyway with no connection to the real world.Add to all this a dozen or so other cliche scenes, and you have yourself a bad movie, worth no more than 5\/10.

Can it possibly get any worse than it has been already? In truth, it will probably get better as we now move into Oscar Season.And here is the first major film contending for Oscars, already touted by many a critic as one of the best, if not the best, film of the year. It is possible that it will pick up some. I myself am praying to God that it is entirely ignored. Well, mostly ignored, because there is at least one decently Oscar-worthy performance in the film. But most of it is medium-par Hollywood filmmaking at its best. At its worse, it is a sitcom.Okay, let me do a pros vs cons list for Almost FamousPros Okay, the one very good performance in this movie belongs to Billy Crudup (playing a rock guitarist named Russell Hammond). I have never seen him in a movie before, but I commend him to the utmost for bringing the character of Ashitaka to life in the corrupted American version of the Japanese animated masterpiece Princess Mononoke. In Almost Famous, he is probably the most fully developed character, even more fully developed than the film's two main characters, William Miller (Patrick Fugit) and Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). Crudup is the only actor in the cast who is capable of being funny without trying to look like he is funny. He emits an aura of apathy, as his character requires, in a very natural and believable manner. The only scene in the film which attains greatness, the only scene which is not going to be out of my mind entirely by the time I go to bed tonight, is the one where Russell, sick with the way the band is going, goes to the house of some Topeka teenagers who are having a party. I won't give the scene away, since it is the best scene of the movie, but it is amazing. It works both dramatically and, especially, it is successful as comedy. Other highpoints in the movie...well, there aren't all that many. It sometimes has a nice mood to it, but there was always something coming up to ruin it. There were a lot of great songs, but they were poorly used. Oh yeah, Phillip Seymour Hoffman was in it and he was great, but he had too few scenes, so he in no way could save the movie.Okay, well, it seems that I've already gotten into the cons, so let me proceed  with them SPOILER ALERT Poorly judged comedic moments were frequent. A groupie, oh, sorry, Band-Aide, is running after the tour bus to tell William something, and she crashes into another bus when running. This isn't a slapstick comedy, so this scene just shouldn't have been in here. That had to have hurt a lot, and we should be aware of that, even though I'm willing to bet that nobody in the audience was. Francis McDormand, often a great actress, just see Fargo or Blood Simple or Mississippi Burning, is extremely annoying as an unbelievably insane mother. There are many moments involving her character which are supposed to be funny, but just ended up making me cringe with discomfort. The only scene where humor involving her character succeeds is when she talks to Russell Hammond on the telephone, and that scene is only very successful because of Crudup's good performance.

The plot is horrible, the acting is NOT the best work the crew has done, and the movie is comprised of a lot of bad special effects.

Even though the movie is predictable and not very realistic, it scared me. It's a scary movie, and as a scary movie  works well. The director is very good to help this movie from a silly script. However he is not a actor director; despite the fact that elder actors do well their jobs (specially Neville), most of the young cast is horrible. From the insupportable Joshua Jackson with a horrible hair to Jared Letto (I've only see him acting well in G.I.). Only the leading roles were well. Rebecca Geyrheart  overacts, but her performance is the second best of the young cast. The best performance come from the sensible Alicia Witt, she has a wonderful talent and bright and paled face that the director know how to employ it successful.  Probably Witt is the best heroine of this late ninety trash movies. She is much better actress than Neve Campbell, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Drew Barrymore and Jennifer Love Hewitt. This red hair actress is the Glenda Jackson of the scary movies.Becauser her performance this is a movie that I can recommend.

Morgan Freeman isn't exactly my idea of funny albeit he is a wonderful actor but a total juxtaposition with Chris Rock.  Once the film was finished, my opinion was true.  This is a must see film.  After a summer of sophomoric crap (Road Trip Scary Movie), the movie rescues a creative slump of a summer and exhibits enormous promise for the Fall Season.  The film should be a deadlock for Best Original Screenplay.  The screenplay is layered and satirical, chocked full of plot twists and the funniest one liners all year.  Renee Zelwegger finally recovers from a stint in REALLY bad films excluding Jerry Maguire and One True Thing.  As always, Labute is a master at cajoling the truest form from his actors and crew.  This offbeat romp deserves the highest praise one can possible laude it with.
