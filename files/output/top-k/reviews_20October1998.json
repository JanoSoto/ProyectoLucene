Almost all the acting talent in this film is good the scumbag boyfriend, the hateful townspeople, the sympathetic townspeople, and the child actors are all good. This brings me to the unpleasant subject of Aiden Quinn.  He seems to me to be about the Ray Liotta caliber romantic lead and spends too much time as a confused Darrinesqe character.  On the whole the acting talent is not to be blamed for any major flaws.  The writing talent however does not get off so easy.  The script has a logical continuancy problem that makes it seem as though ten different screen-writers, in ten different nations, through E-mail, had an illiterate person staple all of their ideas together in a completely random order, and then had the director do ten minutes worth of clean-up.

Although the movie was just under three hours long, it touched me in a way that I cannot fully understand or explain. The scenery was wonderful, the acting superb, and the story-line was not confusing at all for me. I didn't get a chance to read the book, but if you are not an open-minded free-thinker, then this movie is not for you. At times brutal and unrelenting, this movie, aside from Amistad, lends another view to the complexity and diversity of the African-American experience in this country.Referring to a comment that was earlier posted, there were some good white people in the film. How about the woman that helped Sethe give birth to Denver(whom she also named her after, might that I add), and who turned to give Denver a helping hand when she needed it for her mother?All in all, it can be said that it takes a very brave person to look in himself or herself in the eye and say,  I can look at this and understand that slavery evidently left a lasting impact on this proud woman's mind which might have caused her to do some inhumane things without trying to tone down, or make less of the horrible oreal that African-Americans went through.
