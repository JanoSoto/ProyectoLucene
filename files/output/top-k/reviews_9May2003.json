I just watched it again, for perhaps the fourth time. I still love it. It's a film lover's film.Usually, when a film appears to be one thing and turns out to be another, it's disappointing. The opening motif is usually the more interesting one, and you typically see scenes from that part of the movie, to get you in.This movie is an exception. It looks like a vampire movie for a while, and then it makes a very satisfying turn into a dark comedy about something else much more real. And everything about the film helps to pull it off. The direction is finely tuned to presenting us with a very normal, fully populated background of people such as you would find at any job, or on the street, or in a real family, against which we watch Cage move from almost-contained desperation to way past coming apart at the seams.If nothing else in the film were even good, his performance would be worth the price all by itself. I suppose that much of the direction to him was simply to play it out as big as possible and remember that to madmen nothing they do seems mad.Luckily, much else in the film is very good. Maria Conchita Alonso, as someone else pointed out, is cast against type, and very effectively. Demure, forgiving, conscientious - she is any female worker prior to the era of telling men to go f*** themselves at the drop of a hat. She has a job. She needs her job. She is scared of the boss, but she accepts his apologies for clearly bizarre behavior, repeatedly. Part of the setup that makes it obvious early on that Cage is way out of line (he's much more, but you don't know that for a bit) is his heavy-handed, dishonest treatment of this simple, pleasant young woman. Part of why he is so effective is that she is very effective.I have even come to believe that Elizabeth Ashley's character, the psychiatrist, is a better accomplishment than I thought originally. I thought it was just too much of a parody of the profession to add anything. After seeing over the years how little psychiatry has to do with any notion of getting better, I think the film's take on the therapy is not only funny but absolutely on the mark for showing the patient stranded in his insanity while making futile cries for help to the shrink. And Elizabeth Ashley's completely aloof formula responses are delivered with a perfect mixture of words that seem to convey interest. They are no more authentic than her patient's adopted gestures. If she has a genuine interest in the patient's actual state, it's certainly well concealed.And one more - Some reviewers faulted Jennifer Beals's performance (or lack of) as the vampire who comes to Cage's character. They have missed the point that she was not there to develop a vampire character. She was there to play Cage's character's idea of a vampire, which she did absolutely perfectly - all breathless sexuality, hungry vampire, and then comforting lover. If she shows us Cage's character's creation convincingly, then she did her job, and she did just that.By the way, there is no confusion in this film about what's real and what's not. The movie seems to be about vampires for a while. Then it becomes a descent-into-madness tale that is much more satisfying than any fantasy could be. But, unless you are merely staring at the screen, rather than watching the movie, you will not be confused about what is going on.Cage incorporates a good deal of classic vampire movie images into his performance, the same way that he has the character already incorporating parts of other types of people in his own actions from the beginning - notice that he has at least three different accents - one as he does business on the phone, another as he tries to be an engaging drunk while walking one of his conquests up the stairs, and yet another as he hounds Maria's character. I take it that this is a portrait of a man with almost nothing left in his life that is authentically him, so it stands to reason that as he becomes a vampire, he would take the same approach to that as well. Cage pulls this off with absolutely brilliantly controlled apparent abandon. You can't play a character that's out of control unless you are fully in control.There was no question in my mind after seeing this that Cage had all the talent any actor could ever ask to have. I'm glad for his later successes, but he has had very little chance to show his range and strengths since the days of Raising Arizona, Wild at Heart, and this film. See it more than once.(Come to think of it, I did also like those parts of Face\/Off where we get to see John Travolta acting like Nicolas Cage acting like John Travolta and Nicolas cage acting like John Travolta acting like Nicolas Cage. The rest of the film is neither here nor there, but this isn't a review of that. It's an all-out plug for Vampire's Kiss and Nicolas Cage's brilliant performance in it.)

Enid is particularly annoying in this respect with her 'I'm too good for this world' attitude, and Birch apparently sleepwalking through many of the scenes doesn't help.Good points well Steve Buscemi is as ever excellent until the extremely dodgy plotting in the final third undermines his character completely and there is some good support work from Illeana Douglas as the Art teacher & Tom McGowan (Kenny from Frasier) as Buscemis roommate.Don't expect too much - especially in the way of humour, and it is probably OK, but if this is the best film of 2001 I'm glad I didn't go to the cinema much that year.

It's hard to say whether or not the criticism has died down a bit; the movie sure does seem to have its fan base. Admittedly, not all the stated faults are unfair or have no justification; this is indeed the most flawed of the Indiana Jones adventures. But as such, a deeply flawed Jones outing is still likely more fun than the next dozen summer blockbusters you're likely to see all year long.Set in 1935 (meaning this is a prequel to Raiders), Harrison Ford once again stars as our titular hero, this time in a Chinese nightclub, making a trade for a valuable diamond. Things don't go as planned and an all-out brawl ensues, finally resulting in Jones, singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw), and kid sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) on the run from a Chinese gang. They eventually take off on a plane carrying poultry cargo, but the pilots happen to work for the leader of that gang Jones had the run in with.Thus, Jones and his two partners are stuck in India, where they arrive at a devastated village. Investigating further, Jones decides to head to Pankot Palace, which seems to be the source of the problem. There he discovers the renewed Thugee Cult, bent on world domination with the complete collection of the Sankara Stones. Just what these stones will do...the movie doesn't specify. But this all leads to Indiana Jones kicking butt, and lots of it, too.The somewhat lukewarm response Temple of Doom initially received wasn't surprising. As the sequel to (at the time) the greatest action movie in existence, there's a lot to live up to. I, for one, was not disappointed. The movie promised a breathless thrill ride and it delivered one. And where else are you going to see elaborate booby traps and exotic settings?Temple of Doom's first half is sensationally entertaining, actually about the equal of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The movie's opening action sequence is a knockout, and the scenes afterward find the right touch of creepiness to make for an intriguing story. It only gets better when they reach Pankot Palace, as we witness the classic dinner scene, truly funny romantic interaction between Jones and Willie, and a spike-filled booby trap scene that is alternately suspenseful and hilarious, thanks to Ford's dead-on reaction (We are going to Die!).It's the second half that isn't as successful. Once Jones actually encounters the Thuggee Cult, things get rather unpleasant. The sight of children being whipped stops the fun to a dead halt, and there's a fairly graphic depiction of a man whose heart is removed...by hand. These scenes are also set underground, which makes for a very grimy and dark setting, not necessarily the best for an adventure movie.But thankfully, things pick up significantly for the final half-hour, which is arguably the most exciting extended action sequence of the whole trilogy. It all begins with thrilling fistfights and whip-swinging, then turns to a roller-coaster ride on a minecart, then concludes on a shaky bridge overlooking a river full of alligators. The action is wildly thrilling and breathtaking, featuring awesome stunts and brilliant cinematography (particularly during the minecart chase). There's also one shot which features Jones standing poised right before he knocks out a villain (off-screen) that's probably the coolest single scene in the whole series.Interestingly enough, Temple of Doom happens to be the only Jones film that ends on an action sequence; in this case, we get four. How can anyone complain about that, especially considering just how damned entertaining these action scenes are? Yeah, there are a few implausibly silly moments, especially the scene where Willie and Short Round cross an entire bridge without noticing the villain on the other side. But such contrivances are forgivable given just how viscerally exciting the movie is.John Williams' score nicely reuses the Raiders march theme to great effect. The other themes in the score are nicely done, a fitting match to the movie's tone and pacing. The special effects and production values are mostly excellent, only the imposition of the alligators at the end is slightly unconvincing. Otherwise, the movie looks like it could have just been released for the first time yesterday.Where Temple of Doom definitely improves over Raiders is the humor quotient, which is a few notches higher in quantity and quality here. Harrison Ford's performance contributes highly to this factor, just note his reaction to a threat off-screen (you'll know what I'm talking about, it's the scene right after he dispatches of two swordfighters). I think we're all in agreement when we say no one else could have played this role half as well as Ford. It's the part he was born for, and he's absolutely terrific. As for Kate Capshaw, she can be loud and annoying, but I actually prefer her over Karen Allen, if only because she and Ford have better chemistry together.At any rate, The Temple of Doom is still great fun, and certainly superior to any bit of escapist entertainment Hollywood's churned out the past several months. Apparently, Spielberg didn't much like this film, so The Last Crusade was his atonement. He didn't need to apologize, but it's nice to see his apology wound up being the best action film I've ever seen.

Wings of Desire, directed by Wim Wender in 1987 is a romantic comedy that has a more popular remade English version entitled City of Angels.  The plot was not needed to be spelled out in order for the audience to understand Wender's concept that life's simple pleasures and the inherent beauty in everyday occurrences should not be overlooked. This was portrayed through the character Damiel played by Bruno Ganz. Damiel was an angel whom longed for life's simple pleasures that he could not have, included were the five senses with resulting emotions such as love.  By the end of the film, Damiel finally got his wish and was able to experience them all including love with the trapeze artist Marion played by Solveig Dommartin. Through the contrasting images of a black and white screen associated with the angels, clashed against the usage of color when dealing with the rest of the world the film was able to draw out the dullness that life would pertain if one was lacking.  In this scenario lacking the experiences of everyday life.  The film kept a comedic edge through Peter Falk.  The scenes with Falk were intended to keep the audience from being beset by their own ignorance in ignoring life and becoming depressed.  After all, Wings of Desire is a love film and with too much melancholy with in the self, love may be over looked or considered insignificant.  Falk did a tremendous job humoring the audience with his frightening paranormal conversations and Columbo persona.  The only aspect of the film that temporary removed it from its lofty pedestal was the concluding love seen.  I agree that it was very crucial for Marion to express her love thoroughly because quite frankly it was Damiel's first true experience.  However, by about the sixth line it was becoming blatantly obvious what her intentions were and the continuation of cheesy and meaningless lyrics were unnecessary and to drawn out to be fully enjoyed.  The succeeding lines of childhood and life were ample and heart-felt.  These put the audience into a trance of thought about self-reflection and mended the film to its original stature.Although the concept of angels may seem far fetched to some, this film had a much deeper and more abstract meaning.  Angels may or may not exist, but the truth is that there are people with physical handicaps who may never be able to experience one of the above mentioned aspects of life.  This especially hits a little bit harder home if someone in particular is in the audience's mind.  The majority of the audience including yours truly will go home and enjoy aspects such as touch and smell for nearly a week or so before it slips their mind and face-paced society overwhelms the heart once again. However, if for this time period the audience enjoys life a little more than they would have by taking the time to notice nature and enjoy the community they surround themselves with then the film has justifiably served its purpose.

Wings of Desire, directed by Wim Wender in 1987 is a romantic comedy that has a more popular remade English version entitled City of Angels.  The plot was not needed to be spelled out in order for the audience to understand Wender's concept that life's simple pleasures and the inherent beauty in everyday occurrences should not be overlooked. This was portrayed through the character Damiel played by Bruno Ganz.

Well yes, actually.The problem with Titanic is that Cameron treats the whole enterprise like one of his action pictures, replete with the kind of staging you'd expect from that genre, but not alas, from a dramatisation of a genuine tragedy. Cameron has no faith in the emotional weight of the historical facts, and if we were being cynical we could also say no interest. This is an exercise in ego and directorial hubris from the outset, namely the idea that the writers fictional teenage romance - a story that never succeeds in rising above its clichéd origins, is required to connect a contemporary audience to the events of 1912. You can see the logic because clearly the world's worst peacetime maritime tragedy, 1,500 dead and the planets most luxurious ocean liner sinking on its maiden voyage isn't an interesting enough story in itself. Subsequently the titular ship becomes merely a backdrop for a populist voyage into tedium. Just as you'd feel uneasy at the prospect of Michael Bay doing Jane Austen, Cameron doing period romance seems a little far fetched. Jack and Rose allow us to spend some time on the ship prior to its sinking and an impressive recreation it is but you'd quite like them to go away so we could see what the real passengers were up to. That he sustains momentum throughout this picture is despite his script, rather than because of it. His talent for pacing and moving a story forward serves him well in this respect but with fictional characters as one note as these, and with the ships real passengers reduced to supporting parts to bolster Cameron's mills and boon narrative, we, unlike the real passengers are quite grateful to see the Iceberg emerging from the watery depths.Once the ship hits the film moves up a gear and suddenly there is enough to sustain interest until the stilted syrup drenched epilogue. However, Cameron still stages the sinking like one giant set piece which saps the film of any emotional impact. A real tribute to the ship, rather than a cynical exercise in emotional manipulation would have taken an objective position and allowed the real events to unfold, giving us a chance to take in the full force of real events. This film concerns itself with fiction and doing so attempts to tell you what to feel and when to feel it. For me, this has the opposite effect and the scenes toward the end featuring Winslet and Decaprio are virtually unwatchable.The production design is superb and its all very epic and grandiose but ultimately Titanic is a disappointment because it takes a real tragedy and turns it into populist entertainment. History for people not interested in History. If you think thats a harsh assessment then imagine a similar scenario applied to a retelling of the September 11th attacks and think how inappropriate that would seem. These people may be 90 odd years dead but they deserve more respectful treatment than this.

While often that differentiation is justified, Kenneth Branagh presents a Hamlet which transcends such a classification.The four-hour film is closer to the play in language (in fact, almost word-for-word) even than any stage production of the 3,880-line play that one can hope to see in one's lifetime. However, that is not the level of the film that truly separates it from most Shakespeare adaptations. The reason this film escapes that classification is that it is Branagh's film, not Shakespeare's. Where many directors seem intimidated by Shakespeare's language and thus place it as a king above all else as they are followers of Shakespeare, Branagh seems to feel as though he is Shakespeare's partner in the film and thus is willing to use daring camera shots and deeply psychological performances.The first thing that must be said is that the complete text makes a fuller, richer, ironically faster-moving and easier-to-follow, and simply better experience than the severely cut version of Olivier's film or the severely cut, rearranged, and rewritten version of Zeffirelli's film. However, there is no need to go into the intricasies of this point here--suffice to say that the script, being the play nearly exactly (there are a few places where words or lines must be chosen from contradictory versions of the play--most famously the line Oh that this too solid\/sullied flesh would melt--or Branagh slightly modernizes lines, altering a word here and there), is almost flawless.The acting is also wonderful. Branagh's Hamlet is perfect, being just a shade below the almost-over-the-top hysterics of Derek Jacobi's performance in the BBC production while keeping Hamlet intensely theatrical and bordering on, if not creeping into, real madness and not taking him to the point of Mel Gibson's and Laurence Olivier's swashbuckling Hamlets. He also pulls of the stoic fifth act Hamlet remarkably well, something that Jacobi struggled with. Meanwhile, Brian Blessed gives a stirring performance as the ghost, surprising in its restraint. Derek Jacobi, one of the most under-appreciated actors on earth, manages to take a character who has little to him as written (no, he's not a bloat king, but he's not that much more) and turn him into something more a slimy, slithering political operator and sexual fiend. Kate Winslet also (as always) shines in a wonderful performance as Ophelia, playing her absolutely perfectly. Billy Crystal also deserves notice for his fun cameo as the first gravedigger, seeming to understand the incredible intellectualism the character must exude (no one else can stand up to Hamlet intellectually, remember) and still be a smart alec. The only disappointments here are Jack Lemmon, who sounds woefully out of his element in the worst performance of a man who gave many brilliant ones before and after, and Rufus Sewell, who doesn't have the physicality for Laertes and does not seem to be either the company man who does what he's told or the adventurer Laertes reads as being.Branagh's direction is marvellous. He uses flashbacks, created movements with the camera or sequences not written (Hamlet's chase of Claudius and Laertes through the halls, for example), and a barrage of other visual tricks to keep the audience interested for over four hours. The huge number of close-ups and extreme close-ups allow the actors to go on display even more so than they otherwise would, and to great effect, since almost all of them are so brilliant. He also creates a simply beautiful film, something too often not done in recent times.All in all, Branagh's Hamlet is the quintessential Hamlet. I can understand Olivier fans detesting it, because the two interpretations do not agree at any point, Olivier's being an Oedipal story of a man who cannot make up his mind and Branagh's being far more complex and not at all Oedipal. However, Branagh has the theatricality and energy to play this Hamlet to the hilt to anchor a beautiful, perfectly acted production. I recommend this film to anyone who can sit for four hours, even if they're not Shakespeare fans.

I can understand Olivier fans detesting it, because the two interpretations do not agree at any point, Olivier's being an Oedipal story of a man who cannot make up his mind and Branagh's being far more complex and not at all Oedipal. However, Branagh has the theatricality and energy to play this Hamlet to the hilt to anchor a beautiful, perfectly acted production. I recommend this film to anyone who can sit for four hours, even if they're not Shakespeare fans. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"9 May 2003","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Many who watch Shakespeare films tend to classify them in a separate category from all others. While often that differentiation is justified, Kenneth Branagh presents a Hamlet which transcends such a classification.The four-hour film is closer to the play in language (in fact, almost word-for-word) even than any stage production of the 3,880-line play that one can hope to see in one's lifetime. However, that is not the level of the film that truly separates it from most Shakespeare adaptations. The reason this film escapes that classification is that it is Branagh's film, not Shakespeare's. Where many directors seem intimidated by Shakespeare's language and thus place it as a king above all else as they are followers of Shakespeare, Branagh seems to feel as though he is Shakespeare's partner in the film and thus is willing to use daring camera shots and deeply psychological performances.The first thing that must be said is that the complete text makes a fuller, richer, ironically faster-moving and easier-to-follow, and simply better experience than the severely cut version of Olivier's film or the severely cut, rearranged, and rewritten version of Zeffirelli's film. However, there is no need to go into the intricasies of this point here--suffice to say that the script, being the play nearly exactly (there are a few places where words or lines must be chosen from contradictory versions of the play--most famously the line Oh that this too solid\/sullied flesh would melt--or Branagh slightly modernizes lines, altering a word here and there), is almost flawless.The acting is also wonderful. Branagh's Hamlet is perfect, being just a shade below the almost-over-the-top hysterics of Derek Jacobi's performance in the BBC production while keeping Hamlet intensely theatrical and bordering on, if not creeping into, real madness and not taking him to the point of Mel Gibson's and Laurence Olivier's swashbuckling Hamlets. He also pulls of the stoic fifth act Hamlet remarkably well, something that Jacobi struggled with. Meanwhile, Brian Blessed gives a stirring performance as the ghost, surprising in its restraint. Derek Jacobi, one of the most under-appreciated actors on earth, manages to take a character who has little to him as written (no, he's not a bloat king, but he's not that much more) and turn him into something more a slimy, slithering political operator and sexual fiend. Kate Winslet also (as always) shines in a wonderful performance as Ophelia, playing her absolutely perfectly. Billy Crystal also deserves notice for his fun cameo as the first gravedigger, seeming to understand the incredible intellectualism the character must exude (no one else can stand up to Hamlet intellectually, remember) and still be a smart alec. The only disappointments here are Jack Lemmon, who sounds woefully out of his element in the worst performance of a man who gave many brilliant ones before and after, and Rufus Sewell, who doesn't have the physicality for Laertes and does not seem to be either the company man who does what he's told or the adventurer Laertes reads as being.Branagh's direction is marvellous. He uses flashbacks, created movements with the camera or sequences not written (Hamlet's chase of Claudius and Laertes through the halls, for example), and a barrage of other visual tricks to keep the audience interested for over four hours. The huge number of close-ups and extreme close-ups allow the actors to go on display even more so than they otherwise would, and to great effect, since almost all of them are so brilliant.

If it had been as over the top as its visual emphasis on cattle and its crackpot neofeminist theory, this might have been a laugh-out-loud comedy - with a de-emphasis on the romantic part of the genre.  By trying to give it a happy (and yet somehow ridiculously predictable) ending, it fails both as romance and comedy.I can't fault the director for wanting to capitalize on the talents of Ashley Judd, Greg Kinnear, and Hugh Jackman, but the chemistry is non-reactive between Judd and Kinnear, and I suspect the only chemistry I saw in Jackman was the magnetism he wields regardless of the identity of his onscreen partner.  Whatever catalyst - whether pure good acting rapport or device of script - was needed to make this film complete never got introduced.  Judd seems lost and uneven as the befuddled and dumped Jane, deeply convincing only when she's sad and phoning it in when her character is supposed to be experiencing joy and love.  The payoff at the end of the film - which you're expecting within the first 20 minutes - is too long in coming and too abbreviated to be worth the wait.  The one true surprise of the film also comes too late to capitalize on the kind of tension and intrigue it might have allowed if revealed earlier.On the other hand, it's the little touches that made watching the movie fun even while I was knitting my brow at its mistakes.  (The very sensitive might consider the following spoilers.)  There's nothing subtle about the womanizing Eddie living in a loft above a meat market, but it has its snicker value, as do the various shots of cows all throughout the film, underscoring Jane's old cow theory.  There are some excellent musical choices, including a very surprising few bars of the Magnetic Fields' quirky ballad Absolutely Cuckoo.  Marisa Tomei's best-friend role is probably meant to provide counterpoint, but she really only succeeds at comic relief. Ellen Barkin is believable and enjoyable as the older, wiser woman of the film, although her viewpoint is relegated to a single speech and we develop an interest in her far too late.Above all, this movie is watchable for Jackman's Eddie - I am not sure whether it was a choice or serendipity that, through the whole film, we can never quite bring ourselves to dislike him, despite how we are constantly led by the nose to believe we should.

From the make-up artists beautifying the actress to the lighting crew casting that perfect mysterious shadow, so much goes on unnoticed from an audience standpoint.  What is most amazing is the fact that with work shifts of over 12 hours a day for a duration of six to nine months that cast and crew do not argue and resort to violence.  One of the easiest ways to avoid confrontations as a director is to cast your self in the leading role.  Over the past this has proved to be a daunting task. One success story is Woody Allen.  Allen is a comedic director who brings brilliance to both sides of the camera.  In the movie Annie Hall (1977), Allen plays a comedian by the name of Alvy Singer opposite Diane Keaton. Woody Allen made directing history with the scene where both characters have a flirtatious chat that is subtitled with what each other's honest opinion is about each other.  This humorous scene along with others helped jolt Annie Hall past Star Wars to win the 1977 Oscar for Best Picture. Multitasking is a skill that sociologists have proven to be more woman-oriented.  However, Allen defied the odds and was able to direct, write, and act in an effective and entertaining manner.  Not to be pessimistic but capabilities of another man finding this much success look gloomy in the near future.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is scheduled to direct the up and coming Terminator 3 and it has also been rumored that Sylvester Stallone may be directing another Rocky movie.  This pessimism just goes to show that on grounds where athletic glory is unnecessary for entertaining, that brains outweighs bronze.
