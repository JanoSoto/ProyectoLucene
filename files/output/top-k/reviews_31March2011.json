I have to presume that too many of my words looked like spelling errors, so I'll have to be somewhat more cautious this time and enclose them in quotes when necessary.This is one of those films that hits you at a visceral level, like a good kick to the guts ('gutty wuts'), or possibly even lower, like in the 'yarbles' (you can figure it out). Actually, the language is one of the things I enjoyed most about both the Anthony Burgess novel and it's adaptation here. I grew up speaking Polish before starting school, and a lot of the words used by Alex and his pals derive from the Slavic. Take 'droogs' for example; the word 'drugy' means other, and Alex hung around a lot with his pals, the other guys. I thought Burgess' use of language was a hoot, and still get a kick out of it.But you probably won't view favorably the way the picture deals with Alex's preoccupation with the old ultra-violence. Director Kubrick relies on a bit of Ludwig Van in a lot of the violent scenes, lending a surreal air to the events on screen. Fortunately, the story didn't mess with Beethoven's reputation during the 'Singin' in the Rain' scene as it punctuated each downbeat with a kick in the, you know, 'gutty wuts'. Cringe worthy scenes juxtaposed with a surreal hint of over the top excess, that's the way to enjoy your 'molloko vellocet', or glass of milk if that be your pleasure.I don't think this is the kind of film one comes away with saying they enjoyed it, but it certainly gives you something to think about. Within the context of the story, Alex comes full circle, starting out as a victim of the violent modern age, succumbing to government administered experiments in mind control, and coming out cured in a way that presumably makes him more incorrigible than ever.

It is not just the ending that is so achingly poignant, it is also the ironic humanism Bicycle Thieves has, and the film is also chilling in the scene when Bruno sees his father steal and redemptive in when Bruno slips his hand into his father's. Aside from the poignancy, the film is incredibly well made, with stunning photography, wondrous scenery and poetic symbolism. Alessandro Cicognini's score brings a dramatic intensity to the proceedings as well, and the Italian songs are wonderful. The script is both thought-provoking and philosophical(you live and you suffer), and the story follows or adopts a flow-of-life structure. The pace I have no problem with either, it is drawn-out but it is so deliberately to add to the neo-realism.

The SQUID prosthesis which allows peoples experiences to be recorded, reproduced and sold on the black market for people to experience for themselves. The story follows Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) into an intriguing and disturbing detective story centring on a murder recorded by one of these devices. Not only does the film flesh itself out with violence, car chases, and a pretty massive party but, through its use of the SQUID device, it allows for a good detective story to ask interesting questions about bodily experience - and the nature of that when it becomes recordable (turned into information) and sellable - when it becomes currency. So where is there fault with this film? (7*?) Well there isn't much really. At times the film's 'bad guy' seems to become that 90s villain we've seen so many times.

Kazan uses the format to create a distinct mood and atmosphere from the farmlands and vistas of California. This enhanced my appreciation for the book by providing a setting that expanded on my limited imagination when reading the book. However, I think it is a mistake to judge this movie from the book. It is not the book. It should be judged for what it is and not for what it might have been.The story is that of conflicts within the Trask family Adam, a stern moralistic father (Raymond Massey); Cal, a rebellious son (James Dean); Aron, the dutiful and favored son (Richard Davalos); and Kate, a woman from Adam's past (Jo Van Fleet). As Abra, Julie Harris provides a love interest for the Trask boys and Burl Ives is a standout as the diplomatic local sheriff who knows a lot of the town's secrets. The cast is near perfect, except that Dean and Harris seem a little old for their parts and Davalos does not quite hold is own with the other actors. If conflict is what drives good drama, then there is enough here to go around. Cal wants the approval his father but does not know how to get it, and he cannot always suppress his evil demons--he is at war with himself. Adam is at a loss as to how to control his unruly son, his strict discipline and Bible readings are not the answer. Abra starts out as Aron's girlfriend, but sees Cal as more interesting and a little dangerous and of course that sets off a great sibling rivalry between the brothers. As a shadowy figure from Adam's past Kate plays a crucial role. We watch with interest as these personalities bump against each other.I found the basic struggle between Cal and Adam to be quite believable. I think most everyone has encountered someone who dominates by force of will and strict moral authority. Such people usually command respect, but they can be intimidating. Mixing a person of Cal's temperament with a father like Adam is bound to produce some fireworks.I thought James Dean was ideal for the part of the sensitive, misunderstood, moody, and independent Cal who was torn between his pious father and his disreputable mother. The image Dean creates for Cal in this movie seems to apply to the image we have of Dean himself. I have wondered about the extent to which he manufactured that image. One can only speculate as to what kind of career Dean would have had. He was good at playing the vulnerable, sensitive, and tormented sort, but it is hard to picture him ever achieving a powerful performance to match Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront or Paul Newman in The Hustler. The score is intrusive in places, but the main theme is one that sticks in the mind. Whenever I think of this movie, I think of that music.

He was good at playing the vulnerable, sensitive, and tormented sort, but it is hard to picture him ever achieving a powerful performance to match Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront or Paul Newman in The Hustler.

Kazan uses the format to create a distinct mood and atmosphere from the farmlands and vistas of California. This enhanced my appreciation for the book by providing a setting that expanded on my limited imagination when reading the book. However, I think it is a mistake to judge this movie from the book. It is not the book. It should be judged for what it is and not for what it might have been.The story is that of conflicts within the Trask family Adam, a stern moralistic father (Raymond Massey); Cal, a rebellious son (James Dean); Aron, the dutiful and favored son (Richard Davalos); and Kate, a woman from Adam's past (Jo Van Fleet). As Abra, Julie Harris provides a love interest for the Trask boys and Burl Ives is a standout as the diplomatic local sheriff who knows a lot of the town's secrets. The cast is near perfect, except that Dean and Harris seem a little old for their parts and Davalos does not quite hold is own with the other actors. If conflict is what drives good drama, then there is enough here to go around. Cal wants the approval his father but does not know how to get it, and he cannot always suppress his evil demons--he is at war with himself. Adam is at a loss as to how to control his unruly son, his strict discipline and Bible readings are not the answer. Abra starts out as Aron's girlfriend, but sees Cal as more interesting and a little dangerous and of course that sets off a great sibling rivalry between the brothers. As a shadowy figure from Adam's past Kate plays a crucial role. We watch with interest as these personalities bump against each other.I found the basic struggle between Cal and Adam to be quite believable. I think most everyone has encountered someone who dominates by force of will and strict moral authority. Such people usually command respect, but they can be intimidating. Mixing a person of Cal's temperament with a father like Adam is bound to produce some fireworks.I thought James Dean was ideal for the part of the sensitive, misunderstood, moody, and independent Cal who was torn between his pious father and his disreputable mother. The image Dean creates for Cal in this movie seems to apply to the image we have of Dean himself. I have wondered about the extent to which he manufactured that image. One can only speculate as to what kind of career Dean would have had. He was good at playing the vulnerable, sensitive, and tormented sort, but it is hard to picture him ever achieving a powerful performance to match Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront or Paul Newman in The Hustler.

These were decent figures back then, although far from spectacular. POSITIVES - This is easily the most stylistic and visually opulent film version of Dracula. - The first 88 minutes, up to Lucy's vampiric resurrection, are great. - I've always thought one of the best parts of the original novel was the beginning where Jonathan Harker goes to Transylvania to visit the Count at his castle and the ensuing horror. This entire sequence is done very well in Coppola's version. - Harker's run-in with Drac's three brides is outstanding. Monica Belucci appears as one of the three ravishing-yet-diabolic brides. Monica was one of the most beautiful women in the world (and still is at 46). - Another great scene is the surreal sequence in Lucy's lavish gardens where she's seduced by Dracula in man-wolf form and spied on by Mina. - Lucy's vampiric resurrection in the tomb is also horrifying and well-done, albeit not scary. - Drac's supernatural aspects are played up here more than any other version of the tale; he appears as an old man, a younger man, a wolf, a man-wolf, a bunch of rats, a green mist, and a man-bat creature. - Sadie Frost puts her whole heart into the role of Lucy and is excellent. Winona Ryder is also effective as the meek Mina. - Not to mention Anthony Hopkins makes the best Van Helsing with his determined, hardy spunk. - The score by Wojciech Kilar is fitting and memorable. - Writer James V. Hart gets creative and adds an interesting twist to the done-to-death yarn. I'm referring, of course, to Drac's love for Mina, who's evidently his wife reincarnated. This new twist helps keep the story interesting for those who may be bored with the oft-told tale. - The ultimate message of the film is great Love conquers all and the light of God's presence brings redemption to those whose hearts still blip with a glimmer of hope, faith and love, no matter how mired in total darkness. Freedom & forgiveness are there IF you want it. NEGATIVES - Despite the title, this is not a faithful version of Stoker's book. The difference is that the Dracula in Coppola & Hart's version is not a paragon of unadulterated evil, as in Stoker's novel, but rather a sympathetic vampire with a serious case of love-sickness. Needless to say, this takes the bite out of the Count's wicked exploits as it's nigh impossible for the viewer to be horrified by a character with whom s\/he sympathizes. - Gary Oldman, who plays Dracula, does a great John Lennon impersonation. - The film is definitely entertaining and successfully creates a horror atmosphere, but I never found it scary, like - say - the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead or The Exorcism of Emily Rose. (This isn't really a negative to me since I don't really WANT to be scared; I want to sleep at night!) - The fact that Dracula appears in so many supernatural forms can be confusing on one's initial viewing, unless of course you're well-versed with the book; consequently, the viewer may have a hard time comprehending or even identifying the title character (Is he an old man, a younger man, a wolf, a bunch of rats, a werewolf, a mist, a man-bat or what?!). - The last act, which comprises the final 33 minutes (not including credits), loses the captivating appeal of the first 88 minutes. Up to this point Coppola & Hart obviously took their time with the characters and their story and it worked. The final act, however, seems like they rushed to tie everything up by the 2-hour mark. Don't get me wrong, the last act isn't bad, it's just not as good as the first two acts; it's a little confusing and the film suffers for it. - The final act contains two love scenes between Drac & Mina that are very hard to watch. I just get sick to my stomach viewing these sequences where Mina gets intimate with this nasty fiend (not sexually), particularly the scene in the chapel where Drac looks like a hellish man-bat. But, then again, I like the message Genuine love & loyalty transcend personal failings and distasteful aspects, like a wife who still loves her husband even though she sees him floss his green teeth and washes his soiled underwear (lol). BOTTOM LINE Coppola & Hart's version is colorfully lavish and adds an interesting love story to Stoker's tale with potent spiritual significance. This will, of course, turn-off purists who prefer the totally malevolent king of vampires of the original novel, which is what disenchanted me the first time I saw the film, but who can blame Coppola & Hart for wanting to try something new with the well-worn yarn? Despite a fairly weak final act, they largely succeed.Although losing points for the negatives listed above, I have to admit that this is probably my favorite version of the tale, which says a lot.

Bonnie Parker is an average young woman seeking a more adventurous life than the one she's stuck in for the time being. She meets up with Clyde Barrow one day during his attempt at stealing her mother's car. Bonnie confronts him about it. When she finally finds out that he's a professional thief & bank robber, she finds that she's not scared, but in fact, inspired by the idea. She tags along for the adventure of a lifetime. As the film goes on, the lovely Bonnie & Clyde are paired up with more friends including Gene Hackman as Clyde's brother (Buck), Estelle Parsons as Buck's wife (Blanche), and Michael J. Pollard as C.W. Moss. Even first-time actor, Gene Wilder appears as a silly character, Eugene Grizzard, who gets his car stolen by Bonnie and Clyde. The 1960s were a time of reform. One major reflection of this time period, was the willingness to question & challenge authority. In this movie, the characters of Bonnie & Clyde decided early on that they were no longer going to follow the rules of society. In their minds, they believed they were above the law. Never once did they feel bad about their actions. There's a scene where Clyde Barrow is in the grocery store stealing a bunch of food for the road. While in the store he gets attacked by one of the employees. It's a bit of a struggle but Clyde manages to escape. While riding away from the store, he keeps questioning the fact that he was attacked saying things like, All I wanted was some food! It's as if he felt that he was doing absolutely nothing wrong. The violence in this film is noticeably different than films of its time. There were many scenes of people being shot at and killed. There was also a lot of blood, especially during the scene where Gene Hackman gets half of his face blown off in an attempt to escape the police. The 1960s were about discovering who you are as a person in this world. There was a strong fear of the youth during this time period. Many elders even put a label on the young, calling them DOOMED. This 1930s story tells about the risks young people sometimes choose to take. It dives deep into a story about leaving home and changing your whole way of life.

But this, as much as any film made in this brilliant period, breaks with the old. Its entire structure, its whole fabric is laced with a kind of uncanny wrongness. Its construction is built to fall apart, to tear and reveal that beige colour, that badly timed joke, that plot which unravels before our's and our 'heros' eyes. Chinatown is beautiful because, well, it isn't. Its charming yet devastating, funny yet worrying. There is something just not quite right about this film's homage...And so to conclude with some kind of coherence Chinatown is a film I had to work at (and perhaps this is why i like it so much). The plot is labyrinthine, its characters are often generic, and Gittes is a far from a admirable - even likable - hero, but these are what makes this film. Listing its flaws is tantamount to listing its qualities. And this is a quality film in many ways. The plot subtle and enjoyable (if you cant work it out - see, 'The Big Sleep'), the performances are very good, the script is quick and witty (in many ways). So not a simple pastiche.

Look, either keep it all porn or make something socially valuable out of it! Fact! This movie sucks. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"31 March 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is imbued with this underpinning sense of terror; this sense of dread or horror at what 'might' be, it is a remarkably well played horror\/thriller near faultlessly encompassing both the natural and the supernatural within one realm of a world but always playing everything straight-faced and in a gruesomely suggestive way. The text is a pure and unadulterated piece, so much so that it is living proof that precisely why it is that keeping everything in suspense and refraining from necessarily showing your contents in all its inglory is a million times more effective than full on, bloody horror violence and petty 'jumps' along the way to an obligatory genre denouement. The film's top trump might very well be in the way its director flawlessly maintains that balance much later on in the film by the time certain reveals and revelations have unfolded; in a lesser film the foreplay and suggestion prior to the shocking disclosure might very well have been the film's substantial core, but instead of wilting for a final act of frills-and-spills of whatever nature, Rosemary's Baby arguably pushes on from its provocative routes and steps up a gear into more agonising territory, in what is rather-an impressive demonstration of construction and tempo to a film of this ilk. The film is a quite engrossing drama, a film teasing and bedeviling the audience with two realities, one of which would lead one to assume it is a gritty, urban and somewhat everyday drama set in New York City about a woman slowly loosing her mind as she balances the moving into a new apartment; the pressures with some neighbours she comes to be wary of and the desiring of motherhood which leads onto pregnancy. Is it the bustle of the city driving her mad, or is there something seedier going on; something more broadly linked to things of a more unworldly nature unfolding within this very worldly zone. The film begins with the Woodhouse's searching out a new abode within which to live, with the aim to turn their family of two into a family of three. The Woodhouse's are made up of the titular Rosemary, played by Mia Farrow, and her husband Guy (Cassavetes); people with the ability to, we feel, afford the high-life given the exquisite nature of the apartment they are shown around a porter in the elevator complimenting the Beethoven music playing somewhere within the complex once inside the apartment proper and the generally rich nature of the interior furnishing. But we are all informed of some prior nastiness that once happened in the apartment and a wardrobe seemingly blocking something to great convenience offers slight distrust.There is a moment, eventually doubling up for the catalyst of what later transpires, in which Rosemary will admit to those listening of a terrifying dream she had; a dream in which she was situated on a dock wearing next to nothing as a ship about to set off on a doomed cruise sat perched awaiting boarding just ahead of her. The notion of feeling bare or vulnerable whilst situated at a locale upon which the beginnings of what are usually long, arduous journeys appearing prominent; the ship itself appearing metaphorically as the literal apartment purchase, those of whom are allowed on linked directly to class and those within a class able to afford to move into such spaces &#x96; the underlying factor being that what lies ahead on this cruise or journey is mandatory trouble and strife, the precise things which plague Rosemary's life once she has gotten herself into this true-to-life nightmare. Ploanski allows for things to brood before hitting us with any counter punches he mostly certainly has up his sleeve; a young girl named Terry bonds well with Rosemary, but this is not a character study between two girls and the quaint friendship they strike up; the Castevet family neighbours named Roman (Blackmer) and Minnie (Gordon) come to infiltrate the lives of Rosemary and Guy, much to Rosemary's disdain; but this isn't necessarily a character drama about numerous people whom live and integrate with one another in a jolly fashion on grounded terms within a mere New York apartment block. The film allows for raw human behaviour, Guy's attitudes and reactions to the Castevet's presence or demands shifting naturally enough without bringing to awares any seedier side to the agreements he's actually striking up with them, the likes of which subsequent viewings might reveal more clearly, as intense or obvious underhanded tactics. By the time Rosemary's titular baby has been conceived and is known to be on the way, natural human behaviour is captured as somewhat unnatural, or at least made so that the audience might be drawn towards assuming it to be unnatural &#x96; cravings for specific foods; immense weight loss; pains and paranoia each straddling a fine line between what might be uneasily typical or just disturbingly atypical behaviour going on to contribute to a nastier cause. Polanksi keeps the tension, terror and paranoia wrenched up to some near-unbearable levels; the fact that certain people around Rosemary, whom she's known for varying degrees of time and most of whom come into contact with the Castevet's, appear to come to sticky ends is a predominant item; the working out of various clues and the shifting of different notions into place occupying most of the film's somewhat agonising crucible. The end result is a superior thriller revolving around the potentially distressing, but with the underlying source of terror being the fear of one's accuracy in seeing through such matters and where that would then place them; culminating in a distinguished piece.

The story takes off with the introduction of its main character, Alexander DeLarge, portrayed beautifully by Malcolm McDowell. The audience is then taken along for a ride to experience the nighttime festivities of Alex and his gang. An ordinary night for them consists of drinking spiked milk, beating howling old men, instigating fights with other local gangs, causing cars to swerve out of control while playing hogs of the road, and then a bit of sex with non consenting victims. Though the film is set in a future where the young are cunning and ruthless, Alex himself still seems to be a misfit of his time. All he seems to understand is crime. He enjoys every awful bit of his adventurous evenings without ever shedding any signs of pity or remorse. In his mind, it's as if it's right to be incompetent and abysmal. According to Alex, living this life of constant immoral crime puts him one foot above the rest of society. Even his fellow gang members (referred to as droogs in the film) don't always agree with his self-centered indulgence. Eventually the droogs decide that they are no longer going to tolerate his leadership. When this decision is first brought up to Alex, he punishes them in a memorable slow-motion scene. The droogs then devise a plan to double cross their unwanted leader. Set up by his supposed friends, Alex is left helplessly injured at a crime scene. The cops arrive on site to find Alex with a nasty blow to the head by one of his droogs. It is then discovered by the police that Alex has murdered a woman in her home. This ordeal sends him straight to prison where he's forced to cooperate with the law. While serving time, Alex learns of an experimental procedure called The Ludovico Technique. This so-called treatment was designed with intent to reform criminals and keep them from ever committing crimes again. Alex, in an attempt to escape the dreadfulness of prison, manages to win himself a role as the human guinea pig for this new experiment. However, the final outcome of this new treatment is not what Alex expects to receive, and once free from the clutches of prison, he finds that the world of his past has long since transformed into a vengeful realm that is not to his liking. There is a wide diversity of characters in this film. Each character, big or small, finds a way to stand out and be unique. For example, the constantly grinning P.R. Deltoid, performed intriguingly by actor Aubrey Morris, finds a way to always steal the audience in his limited screen time. His unique character ends almost every sentence with a questioning Yes? Another character that frequently stands out in his limited screen time is the lovable character of Dad, played by Philip Stone. Stuttering Dad always seems scared to death of his own son, Alex. What many may find interesting about the script of A Clockwork Orange is the fact that the dishonorable main character is never truly punished for the crimes he commits. Instead, he's simply rewarded for them. Alex never truly reforms into a better person. The story devises a way for the audience to root for this demented character. Alex enjoys and loves every last bit of his evil actions but doesn't end up being punished for the extreme crimes he's committed, which is totally contradictory to the standards of the Classic Hollywood Style where the villain almost always paid for his wrong doings. Wendy Carlos was in charge of the music for this film, and was responsible for the computerized sounds this music created. Kubrick & Carlos continued working together, and similar music can be heard in Kubrick's later film, The Shining. In some scenes of Clockwork, the music featured is very contradictory to what is happening in the scene itself. For example, there is a scene featuring happy, dancing music while the scene itself is showing the audience a gang tearing off the clothes of an innocent girl and attempting to rape her. There is also a scene where Alex is singing to himself the famous, happy song, Singing in the Rain. As he's singing this happy and joyous tune, him and his droogs are beating an elderly man and preparing to rape a helpless woman. These scenes really find ways to discombobulate your mind. (Great Bolshy Yarblockos!) The editing of this film remains distinct with its classic long, still shots, and its frequent zoom-ins and zoom-outs. There is a memorable high-speed scene in a bedroom where Alex is enjoying a threesome with some girls he encountered at a music shop earlier in the day. The shot is quite long even as it is being shown in high speed. There is also the slow motion scene that was brought up earlier where Alex feels he needs to put his droogs in place by injuring them and pushing them into the harbor. These fancy shots give the audience a different and more unique product than what they would be given if the scenes had been shown at regular speed. Kubrick was not on a quest to give the world a movie they had already seen. He wanted to emphasize the film's uniqueness in every way possible. In some ways, A Clockwork Orange can reflect the exploitation period of cinema. Some aspects of the story can be considered a cautionary tale, feeding on the fear of the unknown future. This story can remind mankind to enter its future with caution, and to make sure that upholding the law remains enforced. This is truly a story that can be looked upon as a warning. In summary, A Clockwork Orange is a story about a boy who knows no good. For a change, the film shows the perspective of a violent demented character as opposed to a rugged heroic figure.

However, the final outcome of this new treatment is not what Alex expects to receive, and once free from the clutches of prison, he finds that the world of his past has long since transformed into a vengeful realm that is not to his liking. There is a wide diversity of characters in this film. Each character, big or small, finds a way to stand out and be unique. For example, the constantly grinning P.R. Deltoid, performed intriguingly by actor Aubrey Morris, finds a way to always steal the audience in his limited screen time. His unique character ends almost every sentence with a questioning Yes? Another character that frequently stands out in his limited screen time is the lovable character of Dad, played by Philip Stone. Stuttering Dad always seems scared to death of his own son, Alex. What many may find interesting about the script of A Clockwork Orange is the fact that the dishonorable main character is never truly punished for the crimes he commits. Instead, he's simply rewarded for them. Alex never truly reforms into a better person. The story devises a way for the audience to root for this demented character. Alex enjoys and loves every last bit of his evil actions but doesn't end up being punished for the extreme crimes he's committed, which is totally contradictory to the standards of the Classic Hollywood Style where the villain almost always paid for his wrong doings. Wendy Carlos was in charge of the music for this film, and was responsible for the computerized sounds this music created. Kubrick & Carlos continued working together, and similar music can be heard in Kubrick's later film, The Shining. In some scenes of Clockwork, the music featured is very contradictory to what is happening in the scene itself. For example, there is a scene featuring happy, dancing music while the scene itself is showing the audience a gang tearing off the clothes of an innocent girl and attempting to rape her. There is also a scene where Alex is singing to himself the famous, happy song, Singing in the Rain. As he's singing this happy and joyous tune, him and his droogs are beating an elderly man and preparing to rape a helpless woman. These scenes really find ways to discombobulate your mind. (Great Bolshy Yarblockos!) The editing of this film remains distinct with its classic long, still shots, and its frequent zoom-ins and zoom-outs. There is a memorable high-speed scene in a bedroom where Alex is enjoying a threesome with some girls he encountered at a music shop earlier in the day. The shot is quite long even as it is being shown in high speed. There is also the slow motion scene that was brought up earlier where Alex feels he needs to put his droogs in place by injuring them and pushing them into the harbor. These fancy shots give the audience a different and more unique product than what they would be given if the scenes had been shown at regular speed. Kubrick was not on a quest to give the world a movie they had already seen. He wanted to emphasize the film's uniqueness in every way possible. In some ways, A Clockwork Orange can reflect the exploitation period of cinema. Some aspects of the story can be considered a cautionary tale, feeding on the fear of the unknown future. This story can remind mankind to enter its future with caution, and to make sure that upholding the law remains enforced. This is truly a story that can be looked upon as a warning. In summary, A Clockwork Orange is a story about a boy who knows no good. For a change, the film shows the perspective of a violent demented character as opposed to a rugged heroic figure.
