And no one is lying. Memories shared serve each one differently. This film, being based on his autobiography and narrated by Evans himself, is clearly his side. This makes it less objective than one normally expects documentaries to be, but also way more entertaining.When the film starts in the mid-1950's, Evans was already doing very well as an executive in the Evan-Picone women's clothing company. He was poolside in Beverly Hills when he was discovered by Norma Shearer, who decided he was the right person to play her late husband, Irving Thalberg, in the film Man of a Thousand Faces. Suddenly he became an actor on the west coast in addition to being a businessman on the east coast.Next up was a key role in The Sun Also Rises, but Ernest Hemingway and a number of the other important people involved in making the film demanded that Evans be fired. The producer, Darryl Zanuck, arrived on location, where Evans had been practicing bullfighting for several months, and announced that the kid stays in the picture. Suddenly Evans realized that he really wanted to be a producer, so he could be the person who has that kind of power.Evans' rise to the top is quite amazing. Only about 10 years after this pivotal event, he was running Paramount and was involved (instrumental, to hear him tell it) in some of the biggest films of the time.The way Evans narrates the film is highly entertaining, both because of the actual content but also because you're always wondering just how much of what you're hearing is really true. But somehow he manages to weave enough self-deprecating words in amongst the self-congratulating ones to make you like him, in spite of his faults.The film contains very little if any newly filmed material. It consists mostly of news footage, clips from films, and still pictures, with narration by Evans throughout. The handling of the still pictures was particularly interesting, because the foreground parts of the pictures were made to seem to float in a three-dimensional way above the backgrounds, making them far more alive and interesting than they could have been.I highly recommend that you make an effort to see this film. And if you don't normally like documentaries, this one will change your mind.Seen on 8\/29\/2002.

You'd think a documentarian would want to know more about his subject. He pretty much bungled that whole area though, and neglected to connect the title to the film very well. I must admit, however, that I liked some of the underlying statements about violence and the media. (Not saying I agree that the media can cause people to go crazy. If someone watches the 6 o'clock news and starts killing people they probably have a few screws loose to begin with.)2) This film should never, EVER under any circumstances, be considered a sequel. Berlinger actually wanted the studio to change the title so it didn't have the Blair Witch 2 bit, but it didn't happen, since they wanted to make sure they could cash off the original. This film is a side story, in a kind of skewed reality in which the original was just a movie, but the mythology was real. 5 20-somethings obsess over the mythology and the possibility that the movie was more real than the media let on. (This is expounded on a bit in supplemental books based on both of the movies.)If you take the two things into account, and push the fact that the movie was just trying to make more money off of viewers of the first film (Which is sadly true) out of your head, and don't take the whole thing too seriously, this movie is actually pretty watchable.The acting's not fantastic, (Though it's not horrible either) and, depending on how you look at the film, may make you laugh and\/or grimace at points. The camera work is pretty good, most of the special effects are good enough, and if you're watching the DVD or VHS home video versions, you can even see little hidden bits throughout the film on walls and other surfaces. (Words, images, symbols, etc. These are absent from Pay-Per-View TV and theatrical versions though, and possibly any premium channel versions that are shown.) Finding these are half of the fun of watching the film. The story itself is the best part in my opinion. It adds a bit of layered reality. In the reality of the original film, the mythology and the project itself are real. In the second film, the mythology is real, and the film pretty much says the project was fake, though it's hinted that it could've been real, and of course, in real life, the whole thing is total fabrication.All-in-all, for a film that had about an 1 year turnaround time, it turned out pretty good. (This coming from a huge fan of the whole mythology and films in general.)

Tom Cruise plays Detective John Anderton, who works in the pre-crime division of the Washington, D.C. police force, and is a key figure in a successful experimental program to arrest murderers before they commit the murder, based on the visions of three pre-cogs floating in a tank. The film opens with a red ball case, in which there is little warning and therefore time is of the essence. The pre-cogs provide visions and (inexplicably) the full names of the future murderer and the victim(s), but nothing else, so John is left to try to narrow down the location based on that limited data.He goes to work in front of a futuristic wall sized display, using special gloves that recognize his movements and gestures as commands to zoom, discard, and so on. Classical music plays on the soundtrack, conveying the impression that he is as skilled as a concert musician at working his way through the data. Eventually he has enough clues to leap into action with the rest of the SWAT-like team, flying across town in a futuristic blade-less helicopter-like vehicle, trying to reach the murder scene before the murder occurs. The pre-cogs' determination of the time of the murder is down to the second, so they always know exactly how much time they have left.Soon after they return, the pre-crime unit is visited by Detective Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), who has been sent from the Justice Department to looks for flaws in the system before an imminent critical vote on whether or not pre-crime should go nationwide. We also meet Anderton's boss (Max von Sydow) and learn more about Anderton's past.If you've seen the previews, the next revelation will be no surprise, but you might want to stop reading now if you want to minimize your knowledge of the plot... John Anderton's name shows up in the system as a future murderer. It is predicted that he will murder someone who he has never met in less than 36 hours. He runs, and the movie takes off running with him.I think what makes the film work so well is the story. It is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, whose short stories are also behind Blade Runner and Total Recall. One of the two screenwriters wrote the screenplays for both Get Shorty and Out of Sight. It's simply a first-rate whodunit with lots of twists and turns that feel real, with great humanity mixed in.The film also presents a fully fleshed out view of the future. There are sensors in public places that can identify and track people by their retinal patterns, and in a memorable scene, mechanical spiders that fan out throughout an apartment building to scan all the occupants (the spiders are excellent computer animations, while the building itself was apparently a real set). There are newspapers that change to show the latest news, and advertising posters on the walls that customize themselves and talk directly to the specific people as they walk by (a particularly objectionable part of this future if you ask me).The acting is solid if not spectacular, with the possible exception of Samantha Morton, who is very good as one of the pre-cogs. I also think Tim Blake Nelson is good in a small role.The cinematography is consistently a little hazy looking and almost monochromatic. This is obviously an intentional effect, but it was a little distracting to me.I just realized that I haven't mentioned that this film was directed by Steven Spielberg. This film is far from the cold detachment of Artificial Intelligence AI and probably closer to some of his earlier work. Think of it as Close Encounters of the Third Kind with way more action, or Raiders of the Lost Ark with less but a more thought-provoking story.This film is one of the few films that has gotten a wide release that I can recommend without reservation.

Coincidentally, in all the hearing I've experienced, none of it has been bad - not even mediocre.  That's impressive.  This is movie is doing well under the Blair Witch formula - a indie movie with a very limited release that is the benefactor of great word-of-mouth.  $158 million is nothing to sneeze at. This movie was well written, well directed, well acted, well produced. There really is nothing special about the story itself.  This movie is about a single woman who's stuck in life.  Her parents are worried she'll be an old maid (her father thinks she already is).  She decides to change her course in life and ends up meeting prince charming.  What makes this run-of-the-mill story so special is how it is told.  There is well written dialogue, interesting characters who have realism, wit, and good acting. Nia Vardalos, who plays the lead character, Toula, had the presence required.  Her parents and family members, played by half the population of Crete, play each role, from grandma, to brother, to cousin, with perfection. But what genre is this movie?  It's a chick flick that guys won't mind seeing (which means a date that's bound to impress the lady-friend).  This is not the typical chick flick.

Algernon Moncrieff (Rupert Everett) lives primarily in the city, while his good friend Jack Worthing (Colin Firth) lives primarily in the country. Jack calls himself Earnest when he is in the city, so Algernon calls him that. Jack also uses the name Earnest to refer to an imaginary brother who lives in the city and always needs assistance, giving him an excuse to go to the city. Similarly, Algernon is always leaving the city to attend to an imaginary friend named Bunbury.Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax (Frances O'Connor from Artificial Intelligence AI), who lives in the city and therefore knows him as Earnest. Gwendolen's mother is Lady Bracknell (Judi Dench), who is also Algernon's aunt. And the final main character is Cecily Cardew (Reese Witherspoon), who is Jack's ward, and who Algernon introduces himself to as Earnest. This of course makes sense to Cecily because she knows of Jack's brother (but obviously not that he is imaginary).There is more to the story, but I don't want to give away too much, not that the story is really the important thing anyway. This is a comedy and not a serious period drama, and what makes it work is the dialog, which is based on the play of the same name by Oscar Wilde and adapted for the screen by the film's director, Oliver Parker. I enjoyed it more than I expected to, but I have not read the play or seen any other adaptations. My wife, who has, was disappointed, because apparently too little of Wilde's words remain in the finished product.The acting talent is first rate, including, in addition to those mentioned above, Tom Wilkinson from In the Bedroom. They do very well with the material, but it's so light you don't think about the skill required.The bottom line is that this film is a good choice if you are looking for something frothy and entertaining, yet respectable, and you keep your expectations fairly low.Seen on 7\/15\/2002.

And Jane is also very particular about how they are arranged.Jane's oldest daughter is Michelle (Catherine Keener). Michelle was the high school homecoming queen, continuing the image obsession pattern, but that seems to have been the high point of her life. She is married with one daughter, but the marriage is far from a happy one. She makes crafts, exemplified by some overdone miniature chairs, and tries unsuccessfully to sell them. She is a very angry woman, using the F-word frequently and wondering why other people don't do the same. She hasn't ever had a real job.The next daughter is Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer), who is an actress with some small level of success but is very insecure. She is unmarried and has no children, although she is unable to resist bringing home stray dogs. Her nature journalist boyfriend is no help in the self esteem department, seemingly having infinite disdain for everything she does. When we first see Elizabeth, she is posing for a photo for a fashion magazine to promote a film she has a small part in. She is uncomfortable with the clothes and with the heavy makeup, but reluctantly goes along with the shoot anyway because she doesn't feel she has a choice.The final daughter is much younger. Annie (first time actress Raven Goodwin) is an 8 year old adopted black girl who is close to her mother but not her two much older sisters. She is overweight, but her image issues also involve her skin color and her hair. She freely tells anyone who asks that her birth mother was a crack addict.The men in the film have smaller roles because this is a film about (but not exclusively for) women. They include Jane's cosmetic surgeon, Michelle's husband, Elizabeth's boyfriend, Kevin McCabe (a star who Elizabeth reads for a part with, played by Dermot Mulroney), and one more I won't mention since to explain his role would give away a small plot point.Okay, if you insist. If you want to avoid learning more about the plot, *skip the rest of this paragraph and all of the next one...*  Michelle does eventually decide to take a real job, although she just takes the first job she sees, developing snapshots at a one hour photo place.

Some people feel that the dialog is very good, although on occasion it felt a bit off to me. The story doesn't really go much of anywhere, but that's not really the point of a film like this. The acting was uniformly very good among the adult Marks women.

Instead of the 'big thrills' with no thought or care for the characters, Fincher delivers to us a film that has some surprisingly poignant moments, mixed with some real smart 'big thrills'. The film's opening sequence, set to a quiet, somber piano piece sets the tone to a thriller that will impact us emotionally, as well as jerk our adrenaline.Nicholas Van OrtonMichael Douglas is bored. He makes sarcastic, biting remarks about his life while at the same time preparing for his 48th birthday, the same age at which his father killed himself. His brother ConradSean Penn surprises him with a birthday gift, a free membership to a company that, as Conrad says, ''will make your life fun.'' Since he really doesn't have very many other leisure activities and the memories of his father are bothering him, he decides to sign up. What he doesn't know is that 'The Game' may be too 'fun' for him.The film is boistered by superb performances, including Douglas' best since 'Wall Street'. Deborah Kara Unger impresses as Christine, the waitressor is she a waitress?. Sean Penn is quite goodin a role meant for Jodie Foster of all people at playing the somewhat spoiled and mouthy 'little brother'. The script  has wickedly funny dialogue and gives the film a slight 'black comedy' feel.

Instead of the 'big thrills' with no thought or care for the characters, Fincher delivers to us a film that has some surprisingly poignant moments, mixed with some real smart 'big thrills'. The film's opening sequence, set to a quiet, somber piano piece sets the tone to a thriller that will impact us emotionally, as well as jerk our adrenaline.Nicholas Van OrtonMichael Douglas is bored. He makes sarcastic, biting remarks about his life while at the same time preparing for his 48th birthday, the same age at which his father killed himself. His brother ConradSean Penn surprises him with a birthday gift, a free membership to a company that, as Conrad says, ''will make your life fun.'' Since he really doesn't have very many other leisure activities and the memories of his father are bothering him, he decides to sign up. What he doesn't know is that 'The Game' may be too 'fun' for him.The film is boistered by superb performances, including Douglas' best since 'Wall Street'. Deborah Kara Unger impresses as Christine, the waitressor is she a waitress?. Sean Penn is quite goodin a role meant for Jodie Foster of all people at playing the somewhat spoiled and mouthy 'little brother'. The script  has wickedly funny dialogue and gives the film a slight 'black comedy' feel.

I say conspirators because what WE have in the story of SANJURO is a story about POLITICS. The reluctant POLITICIAN(SANJURO) must lead the idiot masses (nine Samurai) out of not only immenent death but possibly into wisdom. There is a scene at the very end when the Greatful nine attempt, almost like little puppies, to follow the big dog, SANJURO and he sais to the effect 'go away or i'll kill you' This however was a very bad translation because what he actually sais is, and with more than a hint of self pity is, 'Go away or I am liable to kill you too' This comment changes the entire movie. For what we have is not only reluctance to lead but in his heart he has killed men for the greater good. And even in doing so he has still KILLED and is quite regretful. On the other hand of the story we have the other POLITICIANS who thurst for power and who kidnap the Chamberlain. The Superintendant, who is looked at as being good, is truly the evil one, but his evility is not as easily detected because of his more attractive looks than the chamberlain. Is this not relevant even in out own time here in this new world? Looks mean everything and if you have them you can achieve everything most of all real power. The only fault I found with this film was in the editing. Being a film maker myself, I thought the scene where TAKEBAYASHI realizes they were duped about the KOMYO temple having two stories really should have preceded the scene where MUROTO confronts SANJURO with an unsheathed sword. I felt at this point MUROTO'S actions did not warrant his suspicions which at this point we didn't know he had any. Which ideally would have been preceded by the one of the nine watching the stream waiting for the signal then the revelation then the confrontation then perhaps Takebayashi and the other men telling Muroto to hurry and go and collect the superintendant who insisted on going himself. Think about this too...A Saturday afternoon it's raining and you turn on the television and SANJURO is on. What do you do? Better yet it is just about to begin. What do you do? Me, I laugh, with a laugh reminiscent of SANJURO'S at the very begining, and kick back and confess yes there is a patron god of the cinema, like the god of war and the god of the sea and the goddess of love and...well his name is KUROSAWA and he once lived! and he lives on and on and on...
