It has a lot to do with the dialogue by George Bernard Shaw which has such an interesting take on people - how you classify them and how you treat them. However, the most intriguing thing about this movie is always the cast and characters. Alfred Doolittle always cracks me up with his philosophy. Freddy is so innocent and pure and he has the best song of the movie. As for Eliza Doolittle, a lot has been said about how Julie Andrews was passed over by Jack Warner for this role. I am a big fan of Julie Andrews and I think it was really quite a poetic justice that she eventually won Oscar for Mary Poppins in the same year as MFL. However, how can you blame Jack Warner? Audrey Hepburn was a good choice for the film version. Especially when the transformation to a lady is complete at the embassy ball, there is no better actress than Audrey Hepburn to portray a Lady with class and elegance that can dance with a prince. As for Henry Higgins being played by Rex Harrison, this is one of those rare movie roles where it's so dominating and captivating that you just can't see any other actors who could have done this, much like Marlon Brando in Godfather. I recall one time someone offered me tickets for the stage production of My Fair Lady. I had no interest and turned it down because knowing that the Henry Higgins part would not be Rex Harrison. That told me how much Rex Harrison meant to me in that movie. So far I have only highlighted the things that specifically stand out. Actually everything else about the movie was also great.

The essence of juvenile & vulgar comedies lies here within this film, and arguably also Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Animal House, but definitely not in the lame and uninspired nowadays flicks such as American Pie. All the classic gags and politically incorrect jests are here small penis jokes, big penis jokes, sticking penises in usual things, voyeurism through minuscule peepholes, the eternal virgin nerd, loud-screaming girls, redneck humor and much more. If you ever wondered where Bart Simpson found the inspiration for his prank calls, well that's probably because he watched Porky's as well! This is the simplistic tale of a bunch of teenage friends, all of them with incontrollable raging hormones, attending high school in the 1950's. In their never ending journey to get laid, they battle against all types of annoying authorities (read adults) like gym coaches, parents, police officers and obnoxious nightclub owners. Particularly this last group forms a severe obstacle, as the boys are desperately trying to get into a strip club in a neighboring county but the owner &#x96; a fat and sleazy hillbilly nicknamed Porky &#x96; and his gang of local yokels get a kick out of humiliating and beating up juvenile visitors. In between all their hectic adventures at school, the group plots the ultimate act of vengeance against Porky and his whole county of hillbilly freaks. Personally I don't understand how you could NOT enjoy a movie like Porky's, as it is so stimulating, cheerful and harmlessly infantile. The main characters are delightfully stereotypical high school bastards (especially the unforgettable Pee Wee) and some of the situations they find themselves stuck in are indescribably hilarious. A few of the highlights include an outrageous sex sequence with future Sex and the City starlet Kim Cattrall and the legendary coach Balbricker's quest to have one of the boys suspended for obscenities in the girls' shower. Needless to say Porky's is a sex comedy chock-full of gratuitous T & A (and enough wool to knit a sweater with&#x85;) and crude insinuations, but if this movie is too offensive for you already, you better sing up in a convent straight away. This was the biggest box office hit for the versatile writer\/director Bob Clark, who directed pleasant comedies like this as well as creepy horror movies like Black Christmas and Dead of Night. He sadly died in a dramatic car accident in 2007. Thanks to films like Porky's, he at least leaves behind a spirited heritage! Rest in peace, Mr. Clark.

It's definitely the best Preston Sturges movie I've seen so far.Perhaps it are the movie its settings, perhaps it are the movie its actors. Who knows. But the movie does definitely entertain better than most other genre movies did. Still I feel that the movie with some more clever written could had been a far funnier one. The movie could had used some more comical moments, involving mistaken identity for instance. The movie didn't had enough laughs in it for my taste and the movie its comedy relies more on its dialog and performances by the actors, rather than its writing.Luckily the movie does have some great actors in it though.

But the movie does definitely entertain better than most other genre movies did. Still I feel that the movie with some more clever written could had been a far funnier one. The movie could had used some more comical moments, involving mistaken identity for instance. The movie didn't had enough laughs in it for my taste and the movie its comedy relies more on its dialog and performances by the actors, rather than its writing.Luckily the movie does have some great actors in it though. Henry Fonda of course wasn't best known for his comedy roles but that is perhaps what makes him so perfect for his role in this movie. Barbara Stanwyck is truly excellent as well and to me was the heart and soul of this entire movie.I enjoyed it more than any other Preston Sturges movie,8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"16 May 2009","score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Review based on the Special Edition cut In 1984 young director James Cameron took us into a new world with 'The Terminator,' a film that was a great success.

I look around, and see approximately half of the audience of several hundred people, fast asleep.And that was in 1979! The recent DVD editions have improved this movie a great deal, the first big screen outing for Capt. Kirk and crew of the Starship Enterprise. Many deletions to the almost endless special effects shots, and inclusions of more character moments have made some difference. Yet it's still an occasionally soporific film, with its basic plot-germ borrowed from a second season t.v. episode, The Changeling.The main thrust of the film is simple - does Capt Kirk, in spite of being stuck in a desk job following his promotion to Admiral two years previously, still have the command ability that made the voyages of the Starship Enterprise a legend in Starfleet? This plot device gives some much needed drama to the proceedings - particularly when Kirk practically forces himself into the role of Captain for the mission, usurping a bright but inexperienced Matt Decker (Stephen Collins) - but it's largely sidestepped in favour of endless shots of a solar system-sized threat . A gigantic cloud of unbelievable destructive power is heading towards Earth. And Enterprise, still in pieces following a refit, is the only Federation ship capable of intercepting the intruder in time...Decent premise, but everything that made the original series so memorable is squeezed out of this movie - the bantering between Spock and McCoy is totally absent apart from a brief moment or two - So help me I'm actually pleased to see you; the bright primary colours of the TV show have here become a battleship grey that only adds to the tedium; the interactions between the famous characters seem strained and forced; and the damn thing lacks the sparky energy and philosophical edge that made Star Trek so much fun in the first place.There's a fair number of good moments, though, noticeably the ship being pulled into a wormhole of its own making and Spock arriving in the nick of time to get the ship into Warp, but this is not a great Star Trek Movie. The makers tried for a 2001 approach, but Trek was never meant to be so ponderous.The effects are fantastic, however, and hold up very well, and the wonderful Jerry Goldsmith score captures the themes of Star Trek brilliantly, so much so that the opening march became the theme for The Next Generation TV series. The original cast, who all return, are good, but they are dwarfed by the effects, and never allowed to express themselves properly.Happily, there was better to come.

My principal anguish and source of all my joys and sorrows, from my youth onward has been the incessant merciless battle between the spirit and the flesh and my soul is the arena where these two armies, have clashed and met. This film is not based upon the gospels, but upon this fictional exploration of the eternal spiritual conflict. All Christians become familiar with Jesus the Son of Man, the Son of God. Nikos Kazantzakis created a portrait of the Theanthrope, the GodMan showing more of a hypothetical Jesus' Man side, or perhaps the ManGod. We see Jesus struggling with this identity, he finds the bearing of carrying God's will onto the world to much for him to handle and at times he resends it. At one point in the film he saysGod loves me I know he loves me, but I want him to stop, I want him to hate me. Later on he says You think it's blessing to know what God wants? It is possible that most men, would find that unbearable, impossible had they found themselves in such mission. The question perhaps to be raised here is, how can one do God's will, without ever giving in to the temptations of the flesh? Whilst we see a Christ free of sin, he is exposed to all human temptations such as fear, doubt, depression, reluctance and lust. This is also shown when Jesus is led, presumable by an angel, to a brothel and mumbles here I am where I least wish to be. Again though exposed to temptation, he remains free of sin and just walks away. The Jesus Christians know, was well aware of the fate that awaited him and faced it with humility and grace. The ManGod of this film feared the cross, did not want it to happen. Also the real Jesus, free from human passions (not compassion), did want to eradicate evil from the world but here he says I believed in love, but now I believe in the axe. I want to cut the devil's throat. Once more, we see a man aware of is mission here on earth but being a man has high levels of testosterone and uses language the Jesus of the gospels doesn't. Towards the end the last temptation does emerge. It is the devil, who visits Christ on the cross in the form of an angel, offering to release him from the suffering of crucifixion. Once this is done, Christ then leads an ordinary life and experiences human love, intimacy with women, fatherhood and a regular job. It is at this point, that the writer tried to tell us that had Christ chose this path it would eventually catch on with him. We then see a very powerful scene of an elderly Christ surrounded by his disciples and Judas in particular who criticizes him of cowardice saying, no sacrifice (for mankind), no salvation (of the mankind) and what is good for man, isn't good for God prompting Christ to repent asking his father to take him back (to the cross). There we see him on the cross and although in a lot of pain and anguish, he is relieved that his mission is accomplished. Just like the book, This film caused a great deal of controversy; the Roman Catholic church banished the screening, in Greece several screens were burned and when the book was published in 1951 the Greek Orthodox church renounced Nikos Kazantzakis and when he passed away 6 years later he was refused a funeral. In the UK, though the film was shown on live TV seven years after it was released, it still tops the list of most complained about TV programmes. It took several years before it was screened in many countries and still is banned in some. It is totally clear why accusations of blasphemy were voiced for this story and for any Christian, it would be shocking to watch this. However, somehow it seems to me this was not written in a disrespectful spirit but from an overwhelming affection towards Jesus. An affection and admiration so strong, that this great literary mind struggled to come to terms with His dual substance and decided to pen a more human side of Him, and Scorsese faithfully brought this vision to the big screen.

An affection and admiration so strong, that this great literary mind struggled to come to terms with His dual substance and decided to pen a more human side of Him, and Scorsese faithfully brought this vision to the big screen. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"16 May 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The film's opening credits are as follows The dual substance of Christ &#x96; the yearning so human, so superhuman, of man to attain God... has always been a deep inscrutable mystery to me. My principal anguish and source of all my joys and sorrows, from my youth onward has been the incessant merciless battle between the spirit and the flesh and my soul is the arena where these two armies, have clashed and met. This film is not based upon the gospels, but upon this fictional exploration of the eternal spiritual conflict. All Christians become familiar with Jesus the Son of Man, the Son of God. Nikos Kazantzakis created a portrait of the Theanthrope, the GodMan showing more of a hypothetical Jesus' Man side, or perhaps the ManGod. We see Jesus struggling with this identity, he finds the bearing of carrying God's will onto the world to much for him to handle and at times he resends it. At one point in the film he saysGod loves me I know he loves me, but I want him to stop, I want him to hate me. Later on he says You think it's blessing to know what God wants? It is possible that most men, would find that unbearable, impossible had they found themselves in such mission. The question perhaps to be raised here is, how can one do God's will, without ever giving in to the temptations of the flesh? Whilst we see a Christ free of sin, he is exposed to all human temptations such as fear, doubt, depression, reluctance and lust. This is also shown when Jesus is led, presumable by an angel, to a brothel and mumbles here I am where I least wish to be. Again though exposed to temptation, he remains free of sin and just walks away. The Jesus Christians know, was well aware of the fate that awaited him and faced it with humility and grace. The ManGod of this film feared the cross, did not want it to happen. Also the real Jesus, free from human passions (not compassion), did want to eradicate evil from the world but here he says I believed in love, but now I believe in the axe. I want to cut the devil's throat. Once more, we see a man aware of is mission here on earth but being a man has high levels of testosterone and uses language the Jesus of the gospels doesn't. Towards the end the last temptation does emerge. It is the devil, who visits Christ on the cross in the form of an angel, offering to release him from the suffering of crucifixion. Once this is done, Christ then leads an ordinary life and experiences human love, intimacy with women, fatherhood and a regular job. It is at this point, that the writer tried to tell us that had Christ chose this path it would eventually catch on with him. We then see a very powerful scene of an elderly Christ surrounded by his disciples and Judas in particular who criticizes him of cowardice saying, no sacrifice (for mankind), no salvation (of the mankind) and what is good for man, isn't good for God prompting Christ to repent asking his father to take him back (to the cross). There we see him on the cross and although in a lot of pain and anguish, he is relieved that his mission is accomplished. Just like the book, This film caused a great deal of controversy; the Roman Catholic church banished the screening, in Greece several screens were burned and when the book was published in 1951 the Greek Orthodox church renounced Nikos Kazantzakis and when he passed away 6 years later he was refused a funeral. In the UK, though the film was shown on live TV seven years after it was released, it still tops the list of most complained about TV programmes. It took several years before it was screened in many countries and still is banned in some. It is totally clear why accusations of blasphemy were voiced for this story and for any Christian, it would be shocking to watch this. However, somehow it seems to me this was not written in a disrespectful spirit but from an overwhelming affection towards Jesus. An affection and admiration so strong, that this great literary mind struggled to come to terms with His dual substance and decided to pen a more human side of Him, and Scorsese faithfully brought this vision to the big screen.

It is a great action packed film with great acting, plot, and meaning to it.Rambo is given the chance to leave prison if he agrees to help the military. He agrees. His mission; to go into Thailand and take photos that prove that there are no soldiers held prisoner. However as he arrives there, Rambo soon discovers something that may complicate the mission.One thing that I like about this film is that this time Rambo is a hero that we can cheer for. In the first film he was kind of a tough guy who fights with cops a little, but really is not a hero nor a villain. But this time he is clearly a hero. Also it is great to see him out in the jungle where he is able to maneuver around and show how good he is in the wild.Stallone is awesome as usual. This is one of his better portrayals of Rambo, gets to show lots of different emotions; Anger, frustration, sadness, and determination.Rambo gets in a lot of great action. THis really is one of the best action flicks of the eighties and that is saying a lot. Rambo gets to use his bow and arrow for the first time in a film and that is great because it is a unique weapon that fits him. Also gets to use his knife and a lot of guns. Also there is an awesome helicopter chase scene. THe last half hour is action at its best.The supporting cast is great as well. Trautman is great, and Murdock makes for a great jerk military guy who really is a coward deep down. Co Bao was an interesting character in that she gets the film into a romantic mood for a little. Ericson is also interesting in how he is played by Martin Kove, who I always will remember from the Karate Kid films.If there is a complaint I guess it is that the film maybe starts a little slow, but not really, and there is some lame action parts. But it is a great action film like I have said before.So, a great film that has a new idea in that Rambo is clearly the hero in this film. Great action, acting, and overall one of the better action films of the eighties. Highly recommended.

There is a clear study in the film, a likable element about it that establishes one thing, develops that and then has the audacity to spin things around onto its head for our own amusement. The film isn't bad as much as it is a little misguided and inconsistent in tone; thus, a tad frustrating by the end. It would have been nice for the film not to have spilt out into a realm of comedy and not get so over-rawed by itself when it relies purely on the image of Harvey Keitel in a dress to get across feeling instead of developing what new level it's attempting to lever up onto.The film is principally a study of the power certain people or 'texts' can have over others, or those of a weaker, more naive, disposition. The one thing the film does tell us is that it can be anybody who falls for the charms or tricks of anybody else, even macho PJ Waters (Keitel) who is supposed to be this ego-driven; ever immune; hard-as-nails; 'never takes no for an answer' and 'nobody puts one over him' caricature. The film's other victim of texts or ideation's that have 'influenced' them to act in artificial ways is a certain Ruth Barron (Winslet), a simplistic and relatively likable Australian girl with a steady life and a family that is very fond of her.PJ exists in the film because of Ruth's inability to deal with the influence a certain Indian guru's image and ideas have on her. Ruth exists in the film to bring PJ into her life and furthermore influence him in both a spiritual and sexual sense. For the best part, the film looks at what affect certain texts and teachings can have on the young and outgoing plus whatever affect those attempting an anti-thesis on these beliefs can further suffer at the hands of their own patient. Unfortunately, the film cannot hold it all together and incorporates elements including, but not limited to slapstick comedy; loose, sexy women as a drive for potential humour; well-known, female global stars in the nude for sake of hearsay as well as well known, male global stars dressed as women for a similar sake.The film begins with Ruth in India. Whilst there, she falls under the influence of a popular Indian guru at the tapping of a forehead and a staring into the eyes. Job done, it would seem. Following this, she becomes trapped in the mindsets and ways of life so much so, that her mother has to fly out in order to 'rescue' her. Ruth doesn't come home initially, but after some banter and some comedy revolving around what a supposed dump really India is, she returns to Oz. Once home, there is a particularly eerie scene in which members of her own family have gathered as one to subdue her, thus refraining her from escaping back to the 'evil' world of India with all their 'evil' influential practises that they do on young, Western women. Could have been worse; they could've conned her into giving away her credit card details as well.Hark, when there's something strange &#x96; and it don't look good, who are you going to call? Why, PJ Waters of course &#x96; a man listed somewhere in the phone-book under 'exorcist', I imagine. PJ is charged with ridding Ruth of these Hindu beliefs. I didn't think it would be so easy, otherwise we wouldn't have had a film, would we? I was expecting it to bed down and become a struggle of sexual politics as this gum chewing, snake skin boot wearing, shades wearing person, who's given all the build up he needs, went up against this young woman out to discover herself in the big, wide world. I was expecting a study of identities, a look at the role of one's self in contemporary Australia and how the Indian 'beliefs' perhaps elevated her to a new spiritual sense thus helping her see things the way she wanted.What we get is a bizarre passage of events. The 'exorcism' plays out and mutates into a sort of 'patient begins to become object of doctor's desire' relationship between the two that further aids in bringing out PJ Waters' feminine side, so to speak. I found it quite amusing at how female director Jane Campion turns the tables on us; how she presents the female of the piece as weak minded and foolish, while the male is the battle-weary, intellectual individual out to 'correct' the female before mixing it all up and turning it on its head. Alas, on the whole, Campion is more interested in shooting Winslet in an array of skimpy outfits (before Kietel gets a chance of his own); she is more interested in a young boy dressed as Batman jumping off a car roof and smacking into the ground as a guardian fails to catch him; she is more interested in the flirtatious attitudes of Yvone (Lee) to act as humour and when lines like I'm sorry Ruth, I should never have slept with you. from PJ evoke guffaws more than anything else, you sort of realise things are not all well.There were some things I liked about Holy Smoke, but they aren't focused on enough for me to recommend it. Once Ruth becomes PJ's object of desire following a bizarre scene in a night club, the film falls apart somewhat and just becomes a slightly unconventional love story with very un-cinematic, and un-likable in equal measure, words like 'quirky' and 'kooky' being able to be attributed to it. The premise has been solved, we're heading off in new directions and the whole thing just fizzles out in a misery-strewn manner. Not a disaster, but not focused and even enough to be fond of.

I know every installment in this franchise is, but seriously, this one really goes over the top. Not that there's anything wrong with that, in fact the scene involving a group of church goers praying to the atom bomb is one of the movie's highlights, but it's just not really that subtle. This is still a pretty remarkable effort within the genre, because they got it just right. The apocalyptic atmosphere works out well, the acting is delightfully cheesy and the dialogues well, it's Planet Of The Apes. At some points the movie does tend to drag because the element of surprise is a bit missing. It starts out with apes trying to conquer the forbidden zone, and it ends with apes trying to conquer the forbidden zone. And in the meantime apes try to conquer the forbidden zone. The ending makes up a lot in that compartment though, I can safely say I wasn't expecting that to happen, but what a brilliant conclusion. On a more childish note, it's always a load of fun watching apes be people. It's so weird and amusing. Generally speaking this is a worthy first sequel.

The movie is based on the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King. Unlike most of his novels King didn't write a horror story but instead a inspiring tale of hope in unlikely places. Overseeing the transition from book to big screen is Frank Darabont who in his director debut scores a home run with this movie.Not only does the plot pull you in but the actors do as well. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do a fantastic job as the 2 central characters and as friends. Bob Gunton is great in the part of the villain as the evil warden. The directing, cast, and plot all combine to make the movie awesome.The plot of the movie revolves around Andy Dufresne a man who is imprisoned for life for a crime he did not commit. Over time Andy becomes friends with Red an inmate who runs the business of smuggling in things into the prison. The story then follows the 2 and how they handle prison life.Years go by but Andy continues to speak of hope. Ultimately Andy will commit unbelievable acts in a touching story that is truly inspirational. The message the story delivers is to never give up hoping. The climax of the movie is fantastic and the ending is one of the greatest in film history.Overall the Shawshank Redemption remains one of the greatest films of all time.

What starts as an investigation into some diamond smuggling eventually turns into another of SPECTRE's schemes for world domination by their number one, Ernest Stavro Blofeld played here by Charles Gray.After George Lazenby failed to ignite much passion in the role of 007, producer Albert Broccoli paid dear for Sean Connery's services to return as Bond. A nice two million dollar paycheck, probably it would be ten million in today's dollars. Connery was probably feeling very generous because he had finally scored in commercial hit in another role with The Anderson Tapes is immediately preceding film. Jill St. John and Lana Wood earn their wings as Bond girls, especially St. John who is a diamond smuggler being ripped off by SPECTRE. Of course the charm's of 007 were never more effectively employed in turning that woman's loyalties, or at least not since Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore in Goldfinger. But Bond employs different skills to deal with Trina Parks and Lola Larson as Bambi and Thumper a pair of skilled lesbian assassins.I guess in recognition of the Stonewall Rebellion SPECTRE decided to go gay as well. And they weren't going to discriminate either, Putter Smith and Bruce Glover are a pair of gay males in the contract killing business and they're pretty good at it too. There's is the final encounter with 007 in Diamonds Are Forever.Jimmy Dean plays Willard Whyte a Howard Hughes like reclusive gazillionaire with Bruce Cabot as his chief assistant and voice to the outside world. How they figure in SPECTRE's plans you have to see the film for, but let's say that Howard Hughes's far flung empire is something to keep in mind. In fact I'm not sure why Hughes didn't sue Cubby Broccoli.Diamonds Are Forever marked the farewell movie role for Bruce Cabot. In his last years Cabot could always get work with John Wayne, Diamonds Are Forever marks one of his few non-Wayne films he was in.Like From Russia With Love and You Only Live Twice, this film also has to do with yet another scheme for SPECTRE to gain control of outer space from the super powers. It's not near as good as the first one and Goldfinger which are my two favorite Sean Connery Bond films, but the 007 cult around the world should be pleased with this film.
