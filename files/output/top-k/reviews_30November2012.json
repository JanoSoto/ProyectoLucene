All I saw for the duration of this film were a bunch of self-absorbed a-holes walking around and whining. We're meant to feel that this is somehow a coming-of-age for these youths who feel completely disaffected with reality crashing down on them. However, not one lesson was actually learned. No one, at any point in this movie, could manage to look outside of themselves and acknowledge anything outside of their microcosm of existence.Not every film needs a stated lesson, that's true. Kids got away with not having one for a couple of reasons 1) The lesson was implied. We actually KNEW what was going on, and how to feel about it. This movie didn't for one minute arise any emotion in me other than Good God, these kids are all dip****s. As we drifted from one confusing scene to the next, I tried to figure out what they were building up to. Ultimately, it was simply that every character in this movie deserved to be hated. It's the only thing I actually learned.2) Kids actually had enough real drama to speak to it's audience without needing a well-defined lesson. A scene which is powerful enough will speak for itself. We know that it's simply a representation of art imitating life, and we come away understanding the realistic horrors that it exemplifies. All that SubUrbia had was a bunch of laughable melodrama. A bunch of arrogant, disrespectful little dillweeds who despite their whining and wishing for change, never come away with the fact that THEY are the biggest reason that they're being held back.It's not that I don't get it. It's not that I didn't grow up in the 1990's (I did). It's not that I don't understand the slacker\/Generation X cultures of the era (It was slightly before my time, but I still understand it). It's not that I didn't feel just as confused, angry, and depressed as any one of these kids at that point in my life (or for that matter, before and after). I understand (on some level) how these characters felt and acted. However, when I was expecting a coming-of-age film to actually come of age, this one didn't. It went nowhere. It showed no development in character. Most characters are just as one-dimensional at the end of the film as they were from the start. Sure, they can identify their flaws. However, they can't seem to come to terms with them. All the while, I'm expecting for these kids to learn something. Instead, I'm shown that they're devoid of decency, and seem perfectly content with being so.The only emotion I could feel was anger. Anger that I spent two hours watching a bunch of snots with no regard for anyone but themselves act out some lousy melodrama. The fact that afterwards, it's not shown or implied that they will suffer any consequences for their stupidity or selfishness. At least in Kids, it was understood that many of the characters would have dire consequences for their actions. Thirteen as well. Provided, both movies were more dark than this one. But SubUrbia certainly tried to be heavy. It failed. Sure, some of the characters (despite the fact that virtually all of them are despicable, shallow, self-centered a-holes) are relatable to anyone who was ever a teenager. But that doesn't make them good, nor does it make the film in which they appear in good either. I'm not arguing against this film like some crusty old man who forgot what it was like to be young. I hate this film when I was 17, and I hate it now. SubUrbia seemed to think that relatable characters would be enough to carry the rest of the film. It wasn't.It's like when I watched Clerks for the first time. Throughout the movie, I tended to sympathize with one of the seemingly luckless main characters. But then when another character gets sick of his b.s, he laid it all out to him as to why he was being a yutz. Then I thought to myself about that exchange just as much as the characters on-screen were meant to. See, that's why Clerks worked, despite the fact that the entire thing was mostly comedic melodrama. Because the film moved from one emotional platform to the next in the context of growing up and understanding life. That is, it CAME OF AGE.I hated SubUrbia. It's is obnoxious and shallow. It may have attempted to be obnoxious, but I know full and well it wanted to be anything but shallow. I kept expecting either a lesson to be learned, a character to have sympathy for, or a powerful enough segment that spoke to me above the level of simple young adult disaffection. This film accomplished none of that. It was melodrama without any real resolution. There was no one to feel sorry for. Nothing to think about. It's a coming-of-age film that failed to do so.For more on absolutely terrible films that attempt to show despicably shallow, arrogant, and ignorant disaffected youth in a protagonistic light, see Reality Bites. Nostalgia Chick did an excellent review of Reality Bites, which in fact inspired me to write this review. It helped me truly pinpoint WHAT it was about SubUrbia that I really hated for all of these years, because she hated RB for the same reasons.

Of course, they were! Sean Connery reprises his role as James Bond and Terence Young returned to direct having previously directed Dr. No! With those two together, what could possibly go wrong? This time the producers drew inspiration from Ian Fleming's Bond novel entitled From Russia With Love and used it as the basis for the film. The film would stay with the same charm and stylish feel that the audience witnessed in Dr. No, making it a straight up cold, spy thriller of the best sort!The movie became (like it's predecessor) an instant hit, and proved to be an even bigger! It's many fans' favorite Bond movie, it's Connery's favorite of those he did, and it's my favorite! The movie takes out with MI6 receiving a letter from a Russian cypher clerk from a Russian embassy in Istanbul. The letter says that she will hand over a so called Lektor (a decoding machine) to MI6 on one condition that James Bond were to escort her and the Lektor all the way to Britain, personally. Bond agrees to her demands, and heads to Istanbul to meet Kerim Bey and team up with him. In reality it is SPECTRE (the villainous terrorist organization mentioned in Dr. No) that has devised a plan to take the Lektor for themselves, kill Bond in retaliation for their operative Dr. No, and thereby humiliate MI6. The story evolves into an expertly told spy thriller about loyalty, romantics, violence, action and above all realism. As I said, it's all told in such a fascinating and intriguing way, that you'll never EVER get bored! This is one of the only Bond movies that is in fact realistic, and portrays Bond as a spy! Sean Connery reprises his role as MI6 agent James Bond, and again he does a marvelous job! I think, Connery delivers his finest performance in this film. He delivers everything the script and the director wants him too. Can't really give him more credit than that! Daniela Bianchi is our new Bond girl, and she is my favorite! She has much more to do and work with than Ursulla Andress in Dr. No, and she gets more screen time! Her performance is so real, innocent and sometimes kinky, that it makes her character even more realistic and human, which makes you like and care for her! Plus, her chemistry with Connery is superb! She is one of the only Bond girls that is really, really important to the plot, and is arguably the most important! A friggin' fantastic Bond girl! Lotte Lenya is our villain in the creepy and sadistic Rosa Klebb. I like her and her character very much! Her character is weighed much on the characters creepiness, and Lenya does a remarkable job with it! Pedro Armendáriz is Bond's ally, Kerim Bey. I love the chemistry he shares with Connery! His character is also very important to the story, and he is given many good quotes. I'm gonna go ahead and call him the best ally Bond has ever had in the entire series! Robert Shaw is our first indestructible henchman in the series as a whole. In my opinion, he is also the very best! He plays the sadistic, murderous, psychopathic, sociopathic, calculating and villainous Donald Red Grant. His character sat the standards for many coming henchmen, with his height and blond hair. This character has it all. He gets a spectacular intro which is the best for any Bond henchman ever! Trust me, you'll know when it's there. His performance is so realistic and creepy, that it blows all those simple-minded and blond-haired other henchmen away. He is mostly seen in the distance observing Bond or offing some of Bond's allies, and I love that! It's much more realistic and fits the story much better. But when he does meet Bond and talk with him it's worth the wait! The dialog is so interesting and intriguing as we slowly learns who SPECTRE is and how they operates! One of my favorite scenes in the entire series! And he delivers my favorite line from a Bond villain ever which is My orders are to kill you and deliver the Lector... How I do it's my business. Plus, it can only help when Grant and Bond shares the best and most realistic fight in the entire series! Shaw as Grant is my favorite henchman ever! Vladek Sheybal and Walter Gotell also creates creepy and memorable Bond henchmen. Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell reprises their roles as M and Moneypenny, respectively. Desmond Llewelyn is awesome as Q for the first time! Last, but certainly not least, we get the first on-screen appearance from none other than Ernst Stavro Blofeld! The sight of him stroking that white cat of his but never see his face is so haunting! Blofeld is a villain without comparison! He is THE villain! He's the head of SPECTRE! Nough' said! His scenes in this movie are my absolute favorites of all the scenes the character has! No other villain will ever be as memorable as him! When you mix all these wonderful ingredients up, what you get is a fantastic film, a wonderful cast, memorable performances, realism, violence, humor and a damn good James Bond movie, arguably the best of the entire series! Terence Young returns with the same energy and stylish direction and takes it all up one notch. In my opinion, this movie is better than Dr. No, purely because I like the story more, and it's much more intense! But as an introduction to the Bond universe, no movie could work better than Dr. No! However, From Russia With Love is still a better movie in general, and many fans' favorites (including mine) of all the Bond films!

The film would stay with the same charm and stylish feel that the audience witnessed in Dr. No, making it a straight up cold, spy thriller of the best sort!The movie became (like it's predecessor) an instant hit, and proved to be an even bigger! It's many fans' favorite Bond movie, it's Connery's favorite of those he did, and it's my favorite! The movie takes out with MI6 receiving a letter from a Russian cypher clerk from a Russian embassy in Istanbul. The letter says that she will hand over a so called Lektor (a decoding machine) to MI6 on one condition that James Bond were to escort her and the Lektor all the way to Britain, personally. Bond agrees to her demands, and heads to Istanbul to meet Kerim Bey and team up with him. In reality it is SPECTRE (the villainous terrorist organization mentioned in Dr. No) that has devised a plan to take the Lektor for themselves, kill Bond in retaliation for their operative Dr. No, and thereby humiliate MI6. The story evolves into an expertly told spy thriller about loyalty, romantics, violence, action and above all realism. As I said, it's all told in such a fascinating and intriguing way, that you'll never EVER get bored! This is one of the only Bond movies that is in fact realistic, and portrays Bond as a spy! Sean Connery reprises his role as MI6 agent James Bond, and again he does a marvelous job! I think, Connery delivers his finest performance in this film. He delivers everything the script and the director wants him too. Can't really give him more credit than that! Daniela Bianchi is our new Bond girl, and she is my favorite! She has much more to do and work with than Ursulla Andress in Dr. No, and she gets more screen time! Her performance is so real, innocent and sometimes kinky, that it makes her character even more realistic and human, which makes you like and care for her! Plus, her chemistry with Connery is superb! She is one of the only Bond girls that is really, really important to the plot, and is arguably the most important! A friggin' fantastic Bond girl! Lotte Lenya is our villain in the creepy and sadistic Rosa Klebb. I like her and her character very much! Her character is weighed much on the characters creepiness, and Lenya does a remarkable job with it! Pedro Armendáriz is Bond's ally, Kerim Bey. I love the chemistry he shares with Connery! His character is also very important to the story, and he is given many good quotes. I'm gonna go ahead and call him the best ally Bond has ever had in the entire series! Robert Shaw is our first indestructible henchman in the series as a whole. In my opinion, he is also the very best! He plays the sadistic, murderous, psychopathic, sociopathic, calculating and villainous Donald Red Grant. His character sat the standards for many coming henchmen, with his height and blond hair. This character has it all. He gets a spectacular intro which is the best for any Bond henchman ever! Trust me, you'll know when it's there. His performance is so realistic and creepy, that it blows all those simple-minded and blond-haired other henchmen away. He is mostly seen in the distance observing Bond or offing some of Bond's allies, and I love that! It's much more realistic and fits the story much better. But when he does meet Bond and talk with him it's worth the wait! The dialog is so interesting and intriguing as we slowly learns who SPECTRE is and how they operates! One of my favorite scenes in the entire series! And he delivers my favorite line from a Bond villain ever which is My orders are to kill you and deliver the Lector... How I do it's my business. Plus, it can only help when Grant and Bond shares the best and most realistic fight in the entire series! Shaw as Grant is my favorite henchman ever! Vladek Sheybal and Walter Gotell also creates creepy and memorable Bond henchmen. Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell reprises their roles as M and Moneypenny, respectively. Desmond Llewelyn is awesome as Q for the first time! Last, but certainly not least, we get the first on-screen appearance from none other than Ernst Stavro Blofeld! The sight of him stroking that white cat of his but never see his face is so haunting! Blofeld is a villain without comparison! He is THE villain! He's the head of SPECTRE! Nough' said! His scenes in this movie are my absolute favorites of all the scenes the character has! No other villain will ever be as memorable as him! When you mix all these wonderful ingredients up, what you get is a fantastic film, a wonderful cast, memorable performances, realism, violence, humor and a damn good James Bond movie, arguably the best of the entire series! Terence Young returns with the same energy and stylish direction and takes it all up one notch. In my opinion, this movie is better than Dr. No, purely because I like the story more, and it's much more intense! But as an introduction to the Bond universe, no movie could work better than Dr. No! However, From Russia With Love is still a better movie in general, and many fans' favorites (including mine) of all the Bond films! This movie is absolutely friggin' awesome!10\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"30 November 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Thom Eberhardts' Night of the Comet answers the burning question of just what might happen if humanity were to be mostly wiped out and what you had left were a pair of valley girls! Eberhardt, who also wrote the script, does a nice job of both parodying and paying homage to vintage sci-fi features and making commentary on California life circa the mid-1980s. The visual design is excellent, the pop soundtrack irresistible, and the fashions appealing. The story takes place at Christmastime, when an unnamed comet is having a rendezvous with Earth and many people gather outside to watch the phenomenon. This proves to be their undoing as the next day nothing's left of them but red dust! Sisters Regina (Catherine Mary Stewart) and Samantha (Kelli Maroney) try to deal with their isolation the best they can, while arguing over Hector (Robert Beltran), a hunky loner who turns up. Soon all three are located by a group of scientists who will NOT have the kids' best interests at heart. This is really a model low-budget genre movie for the era, as it possesses smarts and cheesy elements alike, and is never less than entertaining. The sexy leading ladies are a good match and prove to be very watchable throughout while the supporting cast includes such familiar and well-loved old pros as Mary Woronov and Geoffrey Lewis, with Michael Bowen in a brief, funny bit as Larry. The highlight of this thing definitely has to be the entire sequence in the mall; with pleasant echoes of Dawn of the Dead, we get to see our main characters simply be typical teenage girls for a while, until they're menaced by ghoulish stock boys out for a good time. The sense of humour present is wonderful from beginning to end. It's particularly a hoot when Hector is menaced by an undead boy and quips There goes the neighbourhood! Things never get too, too serious, and Eberhardt does maintain a feeling of fun, generating some effective shocks and bringing out the horror element in little bits and pieces. Of course, this might leave some genre fans wanting plenty of good zombie action less than completely satisfied. Still, the rewards here definitely outweigh any liabilities. It's certainly impressive the way the filmmakers were able to empty so many sections of Los Angeles, and it creates a perfect end of the world type feeling. Overall, this is very enjoyable.

Well, let's face it, from For Your Eyes Only onward, he was looking more and more like he should have been shipped out to The Village (rest home for all the old spies, don't you know?). Moore is rather embarrassing in this one, looking like someone's grandfather, not the debonair hero he started out to be. He tries, though; but he isn't aided by a script produced via committee and a very weak female lead in Tanya Roberts.The plot is rather convoluted and silly. A product of eugenics is trying to destroy Silicon Valley to drive up the value of his own microchips. Yeah, not exactly world threatening stuff here.Christopher Walken is good, as usual, though his character isn't really put to its best use. I think we could have come up with a better motivation for our psycho to play to Walken's strengths. Grace Jones would have been fine if she hadn't been given lines. A female bodyguard\/henchperson is a nice idea, but she can't deliver a single line without sounding like she's in a bad high school production. Tanya Roberts is another who just isn't up to the level that Bond should require. Poor Patrick McNee is wasted in little more than a cameo, when he could have done so much more. If you are going to have John Steed with James Bond, take advantage of it! The stunts descend into further silliness, though at least we don't have any Tarzan yells, and the battle atop the Golden Gate Bridge is pretty good.

Part of the problem was that the filmmakers had run out of ideas for villains and situation that would require a James Bond to handle. Zorin would have made a more interesting assassin or a nihilist, out to create chaos and destruction. Walken certainly seems to enjoy playing his imbalanced side, so run with that. As it stands, he is the only thing that keeps you interested in the plot. The romantic angle falls flat, between bad acting from Roberts and the age difference.

Charlie Chaplin took the depression and the problems it caused and found a way to make you laugh it off. Modern times is an addition to the classic movies of the last 100 years, as it stands out as one extremely funny movie, that you have to see before you leave the earth.Modern times is a movie done in 1936, that depicts Chaplin's take on the modern world and what industrialization brought with it. Set during the Great Depression era the movie's plot is about how the tramp was coping with the depression and with him was an orphan who too was struggling with the causes of the depression.Our Tramp also discovered that life in jail is better than life outside.Chaplin had long been against talkie and his last film before this City Lights (1931) was a silent film and he began preparing for this flick in 1934, and it was supposed to be his first talkie, but he later abandoned the idea of making a talkie because he felt the world was not ready to hear the tramp talk. The movie does have some dialogue, but that can be found in the early scenes soon after the movie went back to the silent film genre. Nearing the ending there is a scene where Chaplin's tramp had to sing to keep his job, this scene was the first film where Chaplin's voice is heard in any movie. The song that the tramp sang (the song is known as The Nonsense Song) was Léo Daniderff's comical song Je cherche après Titine. This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie as Chaplin's version of Léo Daniderff's song was all gibberish with the lyrics being a mixture of French and Italian words in a nonsensical manner that it made no sense but his comical gestures tell the story of what he actually meant.The movie's opening scene shows where the tramp was in a factory and he had to keep up with the speed of production, this scene has been used by many filmmakers even Disney and in the sitcom I Love Lucy used the idea.Modern Times, is my 2nd favorite Chaplin movie after City Lights and the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) rated the movie78 in its list of 100.

One look at them and you know that these are the guys who always get mixed up in something funny. They're called to read out something from a piece of paper which they do, ending their lines with a cuss and allowing themselves a hearty snicker. The scene continues and you see each one of them getting interrogated personally by the cops. All of them claim their innocence whilst the cops threaten them and once or twice, answer back, not giving a damn what the cops might do to them. 15 minutes into this marvel of a film and it had me laughing hard and loud. That's the beauty of 'The Usual Suspects.The film follows the story of Roger 'Verbal' Kint (Kevin Spacey), a small-time con man and a cripple, who narrates his story to the cops about what happened after the lineup, beginning from a small hit-and-run robbery and ending in a waterfront explosion that killed 27 men. His story is about how the five men Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), a professional thief; his partner Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), the smart guy; the explosives expert Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack), the corrupt cop Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) and Kint, are blackmailed into stopping a drug trade by a legendary and seemingly omnipresent gangster Keyser Soze. As Kint's story progresses, it becomes more and more complex and finally gives rise to a big question Who is Keyser Soze?'The Usual Suspects' is unlike anything I've ever seen fast, cold, dark, unnerving, funny, nasty and spellbinding. It's crude cinema at its finest (how often d'you get to see something like that?). What makes it even better is how director Bryan Singer's got a way to build nail-biting suspense. He never lets you know anything you absolutely don't need to know and gets you the facts on a need-to-know basis. Of course, Singer's not the only hero of this film. The screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie, is one of the best ever written, pure and simple. In the first scene itself, he introduces his characters and you understand them, not wanting to know anything more about them and he doesn't let on much, making you guess what each of them goes through throughout the film. One question whose answer has evaded me for years How on earth did he imagine all this? McQuarrie's been equipped with terrific imagination and you see that through his writing.This is the kind of film that could've faltered if it wasn't for the splendid performances by the cast. Spacey is sensational in the lead role, wearing a slightly bemused expression throughout the film, he gets you laughing when he wants to make you laugh. Del Toro is equally wonderful as the smart guy whose accent is hard to decode. The editing by John Ottman, who is also responsible for the haunting score, is what makes the inspiring climax hit you like a 1000-ton train at full speed.'The Usual Suspects' is an underrated classic. It's a superbly crafted suspense-thriller which has elements of a dark comedy. Four years after I first watched it, it still holds the pride of being the only film which I had seen a second time as soon as I had finished the first viewing. If it's on my favorite-films list, I would put it near the top.

To help make ends meet, Mark lets part of the house out; one of his tenants being Helen Stephens, a sweet young woman who befriends him out of pity. Throughout the film Mark struggles to conceal his voyeuristic habit from her.Mark Lewis is not just a peeping tom, however, he's a murderer who records his crimes for warped posterity. Despite this, the backlash that Peeping Tom faced in 1960 seems rather amazing today. Clearly, the film is going to date, it's 52 years old, but so is Psycho, which covers similar ground but in a more graphic manner.In a screening of the Hitchcock classic at my local independent cinema, I was surprised by the genuine anxiety I felt during the half-hour or so before the shower scene. This is the film's defining moment; it is a classic example of a director battering his audience with what they believe is explicit violence when in fact he has shown very little. Michael Powell makes no such illusions in this film - he shows very little, period. For example, in this scene, Mark approaches one of his victims with a blade attached to his camera, and just before the blade makes contact, the woman falls out of frame, shrilly screaming Mark!.Most modern audiences will agree that this just doesn't cut it anymore. This scene depicts the creation of a snuff film, but it doesn't feel like it, does it? Mark shares common ground with people like Leonard Lake and Charles Ng, the sordid serial killer partnership whose recordings make for deeply, deeply disturbing viewing. Peeping Tom should feel like a descent into one man's world of degeneracy, a twisted existence that's punctuated by lapses into frenzied sexual violence and eroticised death. This can be done without tasteless exploitation, the most germane example I can think of is Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986). Powell should be commended for approaching these darkest of themes, but today, his work just doesn't hold up. To think this film was given an '18' certificate as recently as 2001 is nothing short of baffling. The BBFC have since given the film a 15 certificate, but I think a 12 rating is more appropriate.The lack of visceral edge is exacerbated by poor acting from almost the entire cast. Performances both wooden and overacted drag you further out of the film; it becomes an even bigger problem than its dated violence. However, thanks to Carl Boehm's generally competent performance, Mark Lewis is the only interesting and somewhat credible character, but even Boehm is guilty of being badly stilted in places.The only thing that's noteworthy about this film is its historical audacity. This film was addressing themes that didn't become mainstream until the 70s, the New Hollywood era of rapidly changing opinions on sex and violence. If it had been released 15 years later and not championed by Martin Scorsese and various critics, it may well have faded into obscurity.50% ","genre":null},{"date":"30 November 2012","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Peeping Tom follows Mark Lewis, an introverted voyeur living in his late father's large London property.

This scene depicts the creation of a snuff film, but it doesn't feel like it, does it? Mark shares common ground with people like Leonard Lake and Charles Ng, the sordid serial killer partnership whose recordings make for deeply, deeply disturbing viewing. Peeping Tom should feel like a descent into one man's world of degeneracy, a twisted existence that's punctuated by lapses into frenzied sexual violence and eroticised death. This can be done without tasteless exploitation, the most germane example I can think of is Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986). Powell should be commended for approaching these darkest of themes, but today, his work just doesn't hold up. To think this film was given an '18' certificate as recently as 2001 is nothing short of baffling. The BBFC have since given the film a 15 certificate, but I think a 12 rating is more appropriate.The lack of visceral edge is exacerbated by poor acting from almost the entire cast. Performances both wooden and overacted drag you further out of the film; it becomes an even bigger problem than its dated violence. However, thanks to Carl Boehm's generally competent performance, Mark Lewis is the only interesting and somewhat credible character, but even Boehm is guilty of being badly stilted in places.The only thing that's noteworthy about this film is its historical audacity. This film was addressing themes that didn't become mainstream until the 70s, the New Hollywood era of rapidly changing opinions on sex and violence. If it had been released 15 years later and not championed by Martin Scorsese and various critics, it may well have faded into obscurity.50% ","genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"30 November 2012","score":"3 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" The little Shop of Horrors was not all that impressive,I had heard the title before and was expecting something that was somewhat intriguing, but i was completely wrong.I found the film extremely bizare and was not able to really gain any interest in the film or story line itself.

The only other sequel i Liked was Wes Cravens new nightmare i didn't mind that one and Freddy was a total Bad-Ass! in that movie! and he was very menacing!. But the original movie was still the best one and it will always be my favourite one and i don't think that will ever change.it just seemed to me that none of the sequels had what this film had,they didn't have the same creepy atmosphere that this film had and they didn't have the same intensity that this film had either so i just couldn't get into the sequels as much as i got into this one.this film was so terrifying i felt like i was actually in it! and none of the others did that for me but this film had everything!. I thought The lead girl played by Heather Langenkamp was very likable and i wanted her to win against Freddy and i found myself cheering for her throughout the whole movie.With the sequels i couldn't seem to do that with the main Characters and that's why i think this one is the best out of the lot.this film has a lot of fun and creepy moments like there's a nightmare scene at one point in the movie when Heather sees a dead person in a body bag standing in her school Hallway calling her name and later there is another scene where the dead person in the body-bag gets dragged away leaving a huge trail of blood behind. that was one of the creepiest scenes in the whole movie! and there was another creepy scene in the film when she sees the dead person in the body bag again only this time she sees cockroaches coming out of its mouth! and she sees them under the body bag!. that's what's so good about this film you have tons of creepy moments instead of lame jump scares like you have in the sequels and this film was also very suspenseful and entertaining and i thought the ending was pretty good too when Heather fights with Freddy and she sets a bunch of bobby traps for him and he falls victim to all of them and then she overpowers Freddy and takes him down!.The film had a great pace and a great build up to the ending and the fight between Freddy and Heather at the end of the movie was cool and well edited and Heather was a Bad-Ass! in this movie! she kicked Freddy's Ass! and i quite liked the twist at the end of the movie too it was a twist that surprised me so i thought it was a good twist. All in all this was a great film with great acting and great Characters and it was by far the creepiest and best film in the series!. This is one of the best horror films iv'e ever seen!.

For starters, this movie is ONLY meant for VERY YOUNG kids. Even if that is so, they would probably have a hard time enjoying the visuals. This is one of the ugliest family movies ever made. The humour is humourless and dry, the acting is just bad, and for a kids movie, it sure is pretty dark. Disney screwed up big time with this soulless movie. Matthew Broderick was cast as the most annoying character possible the title character himself. His character gets fixed after an accident; he is turned into a robot (at the beginning of the movie), or a cyborg, or something that we couldn't possibly care about.Also another thing in the movie is that Dr. Claw, the villain in the original Inspector Gadget TV show who never reveals his face, is clearly visible on screen most of the time, and he's just an ordinary looking guy. Nothing works in this movie. The show was never owned by Disney in the first place, but they bought the film rights to the show and lowered the show to Disney- fied levels. I never watched the show growing up, but I have seen some episodes and they were a lot better than the movie, even though the episodes were pretty standard.Avoid this piece of rubbish at all costs. It isn't worth your time or money. It deserves to rot away and be forgotten.

Very rarely does a new version of an old favorite result in an improvement on it. An exception, it seemed, was the 1991 version of Cape Fear, which the world at large considered an improvement on the 1962 original. I actually thought it was one of the most ridiculous films I'd ever seen, but there you go.Maybe it was the widely held view of that film that prompted Gus Van Sant to come up with his 1998 remake of Alfred Hitchcock's classic Psycho (1960). Actually, it's not so much a remake as pretty well a carbon copy with color painted on. Each scene is reproduced and even the music is the same.As for the performances, well, there is little to say. None of the performers, and there are some good ones here, really comes off well. The most obvious example is Vince Vaughn, who does not seem so much to be acting the part of Norman Bates as to be imitating Anthony Perkins acting the part of Norman Bates. Anne Heche is even worse as Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, and the rest are not much better.Why did they bother then? To make money, I suppose. The film is otherwise interesting only as a curiosity, designed to prove, if you like, that some films were only ever meant to be made once.Rating 4\/10.
