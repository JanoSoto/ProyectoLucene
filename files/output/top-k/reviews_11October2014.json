[{"date":"11 October 2014","score":"","review":" Do you ever feel like studios don't make good, wholesome, feel-good romantic comedies anymore? My wife has certainly expressed that concern and I have to agree with her. I don't blame studios for green- lighting more profitable ventures, but that doesn't mean we don't miss a good old-fashioned Rom-Com. Well, if you're searching for a fun, low-stress Rom-Com, then look no further than You've Got Mail. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan's delightful chemistry and down-to-earth personas continue to entertain in this, their 3rd cinematic pairing. Joe Fox (Hanks), is a brilliant businessman and owner of the discount book-selling emporium Fox Books. Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) is the kind and warm- hearted owner of the Shop Around the Corner, a quaint little bookstore that has been around for decades. After anonymously meeting online and developing a close friendship, they meet in-person, as competing bookstore owners, and become mortal enemies. Comedy ensues as their offline competition and online communication begin to cross paths. I found this film to be thoroughly charming in its humanity and humor. It is definitely a film that men and women can enjoy together due to a satisfying blend of romance and humor. I list You've Got Mail as one of my top 5 romantic comedies of all time. Go check it out - you won't regret it! What did you think of this film? What's in your list of top 5 romantic comedies? Feel free to leave your message in the comment section. Thanks for reading!

In this installment, he faces off against Mr. Freeze (Arnold Scwarzenegger), Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) and, to a lesser extent, Bane. The release of Batman and Robin in 1997 marked the tragic end of Batman on a cinematic scale for almost 10 years - until Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins rebooted the franchise in 2005. This movie is the 4th installment in what, so far as I can tell, is a continuation of the cinematic Batman series started by Tim Burton in 1989. The first three films (Batman, Batman Returns, and Batman Forever) fared infinitely better in the box office and among fans than did the last installment with George Clooney under the mask. I do not, by any means, feel that this was a good movie; it is widely accepted as one of the worst superhero movies of all time. First, let's discuss why this movie was universally disliked and then try to point out some areas which really showed promise. Poison Apples (get it, that's a Bat Pun)1) The Very First Scene of the film opens with close up shots of bat-nipples and bat buns. When I first saw it, I thought that it was a joke but, unfortunately, they were serious. I feel that the blame should be equally distributed between the Director of Photography (why on Earth did you feel the need to zoom in like that?) and the costume designers (I mean, honestly, does the suit really need bat nipples?).2) Robin shouting Cowabunga as he surfs to safety on a metal door from 30,000 feet above Gotham.3) Angsty Robin tired of living in Batman's shadow illustrated by the unimaginative line, I want a Robin signal in the sky.4) Bane as a moron that repeats words like a zombie.5) ENDLESS puns about ice, cold, freezing, and defrosting from the Ice Man.Plot Points with Promise1) Mr. Freeze - I would submit that one of this film's greatest strengths is also one of its greatest weaknesses - Victor Fries (a.k.a. Mr. Freeze). Victor Fries is a fascinating, complex character when his motivation is understood and explored - that is, to save his wife who suffers from a debilitating disease. Like Lady Eboshi in Princess Mononoke, he does not succumb to the simple evil archetype that plagues so many films - i.e. Voldemort in the Harry Potter series, whose motivation is, quite simply, to rule the world for the sake of gratifying his own pride. Don't get me wrong, sometimes a simple villain is all you need, especially when the story is more protagonist-centric. Regardless, it's refreshing to explore the villain as less of a maniacal baddie and more a reflection of the protagonist. What is a great villain, really, if not a hero in their own minds? Unfortunately, the filmmakers spoil their chance at a complex villain beneath a slew of endless 'ice puns' that rob the character of any depth to which he aspires.2) Bruce Wayne & Alfred Pennyworth The highlight of this film, for me, was the relationship between Bruce Wayne and his trusty butler Alfred. I love how this film shows a whole different side to Alfred and Bruce's relationship. He is so much more than just Bruce's butler; he is a father figure, friend and confidant. During one of their scenes, Alfred so eloquently articulates Bruce's true motivation for taking up his role as Batman Death and chance stole your parents, but rather than become a victim, you have done everything in your power to control the fates. For what is Batman, if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world? An attempt to control death itself. 3) I would also submit that George Clooney did as good of a job as could be expected, given the plethora of other problems with this movie. I found him to be quite a convincing millionaire\/bachelor - but I guess that didn't take too much acting on his part. Overall, a pretty bad movie. My recommendation, watch it as a comedy with an eye for the few promising elements or just skip it.

I only remembered the part in which The Man In Black goes around besting the three guys to rescue the princess, basically everything until they exit The Fire Swamp. So I decided to watch it again but this time fresh in my mind and it actually isn't that bad.When a common woman tells her (I really don't know if it's slave or something) named Wesley to do things he consistently says As You Wish, really meaning to say I love you. When she loves him back he decides to go out and make his fortune however he is said to be killed by a Pirate. Later an egotistical Prince (I'm not kidding, this guy almost has the ego of William Shatner) decides to marry Buttercup and she gets kidnapped by three bumbling people a giant, a swordsman and the brains of the operation. They decide to help the 2 feuding countries start a war but they are followed by a man in black, presumably the same pirate that killed Wesley. Once he stops all three and reveals to the Princess that he is Wesley she feels she would rather marry him then the Prince. However he won't allow that and he then gets help from the swordsman and giant to stop the Prince because someone high up in the court murdered the swordsman's father.Okay, This is a very well made movie but on some points I just feel as if I have to be the bad guy. The whole part of this being a storybook being read from grandfather to grandson I don't think contributes anything to the plot. I also need to say that the setting is off, I mean they make references to Earth locations when you have swamps that shoot fire, giant rodents, giants and a whole lot of other things that scream Okay, this is not our world. I know, this movie is pretty much a fairy tale but it just feels wrong.On the positive notes, the humour is a little funny if you like people saying things only to have you say Wait, what? at it. I think the weirdest is when Wesley and Buttercup (The Princess) are in the Fire Swamp and, it looks like Dagobah from Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back if it was back-lit a little more and he comments that it's not bad, then says the trees are quite lovely, it's just so stupid and yet it does bring out a chuckle. I guess the other way to describe it is if you've seen anything by Joss Whedon, just think that except a little bit more out there.I would also say the set design, the cinematography are a couple of things I liked as well. The sword fighting I think could have been shot a little better (Although I did like the one with Wesley and Indigo Montoya) but aside from that there is no complaint here. I also think the moments when it's intentionally corny do it really well.So if you haven't seen it I say what to expect is pretty much a fairy tale. It's simple bare-bones motivations, true love will prevail and all that stuff. Although it is extremely self aware that what it's making is that and it does satirize the whole Disney thing beautifully. I'd personally say if you want to see it then just keep what I said in mind and if that's for you then, you'll like it okay. However if it's not your thing then steer clear.

Because of this it had been totally abandoned for a few years until a young man by the name of Steve Christy (Peter Brower) decides to come and fix it up. He also hires several new counselors who arrive a week prior to its reopening. Unfortunately, no sooner do they get there then the killings start up once again. Now, rather than reveal any more of this film and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this is one of the best slasher movies ever produced.

Her good deeds start happening after she delivers the memory box to the grown-up person --- who then pursues his ignored daughter and grandson. The complexity of this story and it's characters are actually too much to discuss in this short review &#x96; but I'll do my best. Her adventures start as a young child who loses her mother and is left with a father who does not relate to people, and therefore keeps her locked up as well until she is able to move away. She then tries to pursue life and love despite her faults and this movie portrays this journey. She works as a waitress in a local bar and is helped in this journey by an elderly painter who lives in her building. A mishmash of characters are introduced telling us their likes and dislikes showing us the director has a backstory for everyone of them. The one that Amelie eventually pursues is a man who has supposedly had the opposite experience in life by having too many people in it. He keeps a scrapbook of folks who take pictures in airport picture kiosk's and is obsessed with this. Her positive approach to branching out also benefits her in a personal way as she changes herself also -- before the end of the movie. This is more of a light comedy than a deep serious piece, but there is definitely meaning behind it the film. The dreamlike approach taken by the filmmaker makes it so you never know what's going to happen next and this is part of the joy in the film. This is a definite gem that should be treasured by moviegoer's throughout the world and hopefully opens the world up to this kind of cinema.

It's definitely not for everyone, and a vast majority of its fans are emo and goth teenagers who like it just because it is weird without paying much thought to the story itself, but it has some great acting and soundtrack, a good use of film techniques, and a good script. Adam and Barbra are a happy couple living in a charming if not creepy house in the country. While driving home one day they swerve to avoid a dog and their car falls off a covered bridge and into a river, and it isn't long before they discover that they're ghosts. After a while the ghost life is alright, and they also discover the Neitherworld, a strange but surprisingly professional land of the dead. However, soon the Deetz family moves in and wants to change everything. The only one who can see Adam and Barbra is the Deetz' goth daughter, Lydia. Adam and Barbra soon find themselves relying on a bio-exorcist to be rid of the humans, but is he helpful, or harmful? I saw this as a kid and have viewed it once or twice a year; the soundtrack is wonderful, the acting is great, and, let's face it, this certainly is an original story, albeit very dark at times.My problem with the movie was Lydia's stereotypical goth personality. It is way overdone, to the point where it's annoying and fake and you want to shout, okay, she's a goth, she likes weird stuff, we get the point, can we move on with the film? Winona Ryder does do a very good acting job, but her character was just another spoiled, angst-ridden kid who think her life is worse off than everybody else's. Her parents offer to build her a darkroom for crying out loud! I wish I had one so that I could stop having to send my photos off to Wal-Mart's inept photo lab. Her reply to her parents' offer is, my whole life is a dark room, one big dark room. They buy her Cantonese food - I'm planning to have a stroke from the MSG. She's spoiled, self-entitled, self-pitying, whiny and annoying. Though her character improves slightly as the film goes on, she still continues to spout gothy lines left and right, and it's just ridiculous. I mean come on, wearing a black lace veil like the ones that widows wear to funerals, to the dinner table? Saying that her goth attitude is the reason she can see ghosts? It's not cool, it's not funny, it's not cute, it's just silly and stupid. It's too bad, because it nearly overclouds Ryder's excellent acting job. Beetlejuice's character was played very well, as was the role of well-meaning but annoying Delia Deetz. It's a Tim Burton movie so you'll recognize his style within the first fifteen minutes or so.Check out Beetlejuice, it's pretty good (although my favorite Tim Burton film is Edward Scissorhands).

It's a psychological kind of film, centering on a psychologist played by Rebecca De Mornay. She has a torrid love affair with Antonio Banderas. Their sex scenes are unusual in their realism, not filmed in a clichéd or boring way. The two actors do not look as if they are holding back. In addition, one of these scenes shows the more forceful side that sex can have.We cannot predict how the story will end, but from early in the film we get clear clues about what is going on between these two people that lies beneath the surface of their affair. The story is not at all confusing if one follows the trail of clues. In fact, the biggest revelation late in the film is telegraphed again and again earlier.The movie is a vehicle primarily for the attractive De Mornay and she delivers a fine performance. The character played by Banderas is somewhat less fully developed, but he does convey a man who is puzzled by De Mornay and who is falling in love with her. There are several supporting roles that come in, such as De Mornay's neighbor (Dennis Miller) who wants her and an alleged killer (Harry Dean Stanton) whom De Mornay is interviewing to see if he's schizophrenic or perhaps has multiple personalities. There is also De Mornay's father (Len Cariou). These three men all interact with De Mornay and shed light on her character in important ways. The story really very much centers on the De Mornay character, and that character has severe psychological problems. In this way, and because of her looks, the film reminds one of Tippi Hedren in Marnie. Banderas then is something like Sean Connery, but the directions of this story are very different from Marnie and this is a much more modest film.This is a film made to entertain, as most movies are, and I think it does.

This all changes when he meets Angela, his daughter's best friend. From then on, Lester decides to take back control of his life. The question is, how will it affect those around him?Kevin Spacey gives a career defining performance and once again nails it as Lester, a man so fed up with life that he needed a radical change. The evolution of the character is done to perfection and Spacey's Oscar winning work is the proof. All other actors do their parts in great fashion as well and make the movie even better.

Among other things I love about this film, I can't go on without mentioning the heart wrenching soundtrack that pulls out a wallop of emotions.American Beauty is a wonderful, yet ultimately tragic tale of how people can hide their true selves.

There are a variety of different theme parks that the tourists can go to. One is called Medieval World, which takes place in ancient history. There's Roman World, where the people there are dressed up in period clothing. And then there's Westworld. Westworld is a tourist attraction that takes place in 1880.Everything inside is monitored by the computers and their programmers. But, what's interesting is that the people inside are actually robots. Not just any robots, but genetically programmed robots that can interact with the tourists. At first, everything seems to be okay for now. But, as the tourists become more involved in their daily life inside these theme parks, their vacations are about to take a turn for the worst. After noticing some slight malfunctions on the robots, the scientists behind the theme parks realize that the robots are going haywire. It doesn't take long for the scientists to realize that the robots are starting to terrorize the tourists, scaring them by going on a killing spree.The story of Westworld was written by critically acclaimed sci-fi author Michael Crichton. Crichton took a directing credit as well. His vision of the theme parks are very well done and has some very impressive art direction. But, what I think Crichton would've done in this movie is to cut back on some of the scenes since the movie has a very interesting story. Not only interesting, but serious about what would happened if there was a possible malfunction inside one of the theme parks. Crichton has explored this kind of story in his works such as Jurassic Park. where, In that story, genetically engineered dinosaurs were the main villains. Here, there is only one great villain. Yul Brynner plays the villain in this movie and he definitely delivers his most chilling performance in a long time. In the movie, he plays a western gunslinger, who's preys upon the local tourists, (Richard Benjamin and James Brolin), who are just trying to stay alive while vacationing at Westworld. Brynner's performance really did convinces me that he didn't have to overload on acting like a robot. All he had to do is act with a straight face and especially narrows his glaring eyes toward his victims. Two other objections that I have to the movie is the screenplay, which was written by Crichton himself. The script is somehow standardized, with the human characters saying a lot of standard sci-fi dialogue, especially when Richard Benjamin's character is being chased toward the end of the movie by Brynner's character. That scene is one of the many problems with Westworld. Those scenes in particular, including the barroom fight in Westworld hurt the picture, slightly. But, it doesn't hurt the hardware of the movie. The design of the robots and the special effects are truly amazing and dazzling. I love how the technicians have to repair the robots overnight and have them ready to go in the morning. The set-up of the theme parks are very well done and very well-directed by Crichton.Despite some slow patches and plot holes, Westworld is a joy to watch in wonder and fascination. The art direction is very well done and also interesting. Brynner's character is very terrifying in the movie and even his performance makes him more believable. One thing that I admired about the performance by Yul Brynner and also the supporting actors who plays the androids is that they didn't have to act ridiculous to play a robotic character. All they have to do is wait on their cue and play it out straight. There is no need to act strict and straight up. As for the human characters, I wish Crichton would've done a better job of making his human characters believable just like the robots themselves. I didn't think he put a lot of emphasis on those people, but I simply enjoy what Crichton did for the androids and the hardware.Westworld is no 2001.

This event in itself would have made for a very real story but the movie isn't that understanding and we get a grinding instant replay of the events from 'Carrie'.Rachel is telekinetic (just like Spacek) and her teacher (Amy Irving reprising her role as Sue Snell) notices and grows concerned.

The most popular boy in school asks Rachel out and really begins to fall for her even though his friends think that he is just playing game with her.Rachel tries to make trouble for Jesse who drove her friend to suicide and the football team reacts by trying to suck up to her so that they can invite her to a party and humiliate her.

Landis has made some snappy dialog tying in British and American culture with werewolf lore as well as sexuality. David Naughton plays naive well, while Griffin Dunne is in for some added sarcasm. Jenny Agutter meanwhile heats up the screen in a wholly clichéd nurse role, but her appeal is magnetic in the movie. For not having computers much to rely on the filmmakers do an solid job considering with creature effects. At 97 min the movie seems a little cut-off, yet plausible and acceptable. 7\/10 for this early 80s rock.

Landis has made some snappy dialog tying in British and American culture with werewolf lore as well as sexuality. David Naughton plays naive well, while Griffin Dunne is in for some added sarcasm. Jenny Agutter meanwhile heats up the screen in a wholly clichéd nurse role, but her appeal is magnetic in the movie. For not having computers much to rely on the filmmakers do an solid job considering with creature effects. At 97 min the movie seems a little cut-off, yet plausible and acceptable. 7\/10 for this early 80s rock.

Lee for his part plays an intense and single minded werewolf hunter who travels to eastern Europe to do battle with werewolf queen Danning and her clan.Much of this movie is just an embarrassment of strange werewolf rituals and general bad acting. I actually do like the new wave band that gets screen time in this movie, although I think I'm the only one around here who does. Fortunately, if you view the end credits, you'll see that this movie doesn't take itself seriously in the least, and that's worth a star in this rating. Add a star for each of Sybil Danning's contributions, and this movie rates 3\/10.

That they were presented doing so with the backdrop of World War II was probably immaterial, though for Marlon Brando's character, the senselessness of war was repeatedly underscored by way of confrontations with his superiors and behavior on the battlefield. An anti-war sentiment resonates throughout but doesn't get in the way of patriotism. Perhaps to emphasize the futile nature of war on it's combatants, the picture occasionally meanders along disjointedly as well, scenes changing abruptly between the battlefields of Europe and North Africa with images and street scenes of New York and Brooklyn.You know, I often marvel at the way continuity in a movie is sometimes completely overlooked when the finished product is released. This one had a couple of examples that seemed glaring to me. When Noah (Montgomery Clift) meets Hope (Hope Lange) at Michael Whiteacre's (Dean Martin) party she's wearing a low cut evening gown, but when they step out for a walk along the river, she's wearing a dress with a collar. A similar scene occurs later on the first time Lt. Diestl (Marlon Brando) visits Gretchen Hardenberg (May Britt) at her Berlin apartment. Leaving her apartment for a prior engagement, Gretchen leaves wearing only her evening dress, but returns with a coat on. How is it no one caught those errors? Regarding the principal players, Marlon Brando stands out as the disaffected Nazi soldier, unable to reconcile his personal feelings about war with the mentality of the Nazi machine as personified by his commanding officer Hardenberg (Maximillian Schell). With no room for individualism, Diestl's loyalty to the Nazi cause erodes over the course of the War, and results in outright refusal to follow orders when he fails to shoot an opposing soldier upon Hardenberg's command. I thought more would come of that scene relative to his disobeying a commanding officer, so that left me a little puzzled.With Montgomery Clift's character, you had a Jewish retail clerk fighting bigotry both on the home front and among his fellow soldiers. The scene with Hope's father was done quite effectively to change the older man's feelings of prejudice, just as the overall tenor of the picture attempts to present every day Americans and Germans as people simply trying to make their way in life dissociated from the ideological extremes that make their countries war with each other.As for Dean Martin, this was the second movie I've seen him in within a short period of time in which he basically portrays himself; the other was 1960's Ocean's Eleven. He comes across as a relatively happy-go-lucky kind of character, a singer and performer who likes to have a good time and with little regard for responsibility or authority. To his character's credit, he was a stand up guy for sticking by Noah against the barracks bullies who beat him to a pulp. One thing I hadn't seen before, Dino goes for a beefcake shot during the induction physical. I don't recall seeing him in anything similar in any other picture.The picture's finale offers contrasting scenarios - Brando's character comes to an untimely and inglorious end at the hands of Private Whiteacre, while the movie closes on Noah Ackerman's joyous return home to his wife and new baby. One wonders whether Mrs. Ackerman's name was written specifically for the intended effect of having a battle hardened soldier return to a new life filled with Hope.
