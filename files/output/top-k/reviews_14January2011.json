[{"date":"14 January 2011","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Edward Zwick directs The Siege, a techno thriller which hopes to shed light on both the West's role in the Middle East and its racist attitude toward Arabs and Persians.It would take a genius to properly deal with this material, and for half the film's running time Zwick does seem to handle things fine. The film's second half, however, quickly degenerates into a cartoon, even if it is correct in introducing a character, played by Bruce Willis, who literalizes the West's paranoia, military hystericism and psycho nationalism. Where the film goes in its second half isn't necessarily wrong, but is just best dealt with in the form of comedy or satire. Furthermore, in the real world, there are none of the clear demarcations (Zwick personalises processes which are ideological and structural) which Zwick paints. One example in this film, terrorist attacks lead to one psycho US general cordoning off a city, imposing martial law, arresting Muslims and engaging in torture, all of which are actions which tick the public off. This is similar to what happened after 9\/11, but not quite. The not quites are important. In the real world, the battle and military occupation went overseas, the populace supported it, torture was hidden and there was no cordoning off, just various restrictive public safety acts stealthily implemented and willingly embraced by a scared populace.Like most Hollywood thrillers which try to be smart when dealing with the Middle East, the film is always busily trying to cover its own butt. One example watch how multi-ethnic our hero's team is, comprised of blacks, Lebanese, Italians and an Asian woman. The film's casting is very sneaky, the only all American boy being action hero Bruce Willis, cast as a psycho.The film is instructive in one way. It shows how unsuitable and limited realism is, these issues always best handled indirectly or abstractly. Zwick's literal handling of this material is reminiscent of Spielberg's Munich, both films revolving around heroes hunting down Muslim extremists. And like Spielberg's film, The Siege is supremely didactic. Observe how Zwick is always stressing the way his film doesn't possess racist Americans, the director constantly drawing attention to the fact that his heroes are all multi-ethnic, sympathise with Muslims and are all working together for freedom and democracy. And of course when Zwick isn't stressing this, he's continually pointing out the distinctions between fundamentalism and Islam. The end result is the usual watered down Hollywood Middle Eastern thriller some of them are good, but not the ones you're gonna have fun watching us track down.Still, ignore the babyish moralising and the film is useful in illuminating the fluctuating line between protecting national security and preserving civil rights. It also highlights the uselessness of torture, and shows the state's latent possibilities of repression, stereotyping and prejudice, and the ease at which rights are violated.7\/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing. The shamelessly silly You Don't Mess With The Zohan is still the best mainstream Middle Eastern movie.
