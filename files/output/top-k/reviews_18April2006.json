(It's probably more effective than many other political satires set in real seats of Government). Tracy Flick is the ambitious, (and ruthless), student running for student president. She has the brash confidence of someone convinced they are always right. She talks in clichés and quotes Thoreau. If she could put into practice some of the things she pulls from books she might actually make a half-decent leader but Tracy is oblivious to everything that is real and human and fallible. Tracy, in other words, is bad for people and the only person to see it is her teacher and it's his job to oversee the election.In these parts, Reece Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick are pitch-perfect. Witherspoon had yet to establish herself and Broderick's career had stalled. Election put both of them on track and I doubt if either of them has given a better performance. In this film Payne was honing that serio-comic tone that would come to fruition in Sideways but already he was proving a master at establishing mood and a brilliant director of actors. He is so good at the serious stuff, in fact, that you would like him to jettison the comedy altogether, though here you're glad he doesn't. This is laugh out loud funny. What it isn't is another American High School Comedy. File it next to Rushmore.

It's well-written, the acting is very, very good, and the plot comes to a satisfactory conclusion. Broderick Crawford plays Harry Brock, the junk king, in town with his lawyer to buy some legislation. Billy, his girlfriend, played by Judy Holiday, is a diamond in the rough, and he hires a journalist, Paul, played by William Holden, to teach her a few of the things she'll need to know to make a good impression in Washington. Paul and Billy fall in love, and there's trouble brewing for Harry Brock. During the tutoring process,Paul and Billy visit the memorial for Thomas Jefferson, the Smithsonian, Congressional buildings, and the like. He hounds her (gently) into using the dictionary, discovering what words actually mean. He educates her a bit in U.S. political history, with an emphasis on the Bill of Rights (Paul would be aghast at the current attacks on that document). He gets Billy to read some history, particularly Thomas Paine. At one point they're discussing selfishness (Harry Brock, the character played by Broderick Crawford, is selfishness incarnate). Paul makes a speech about how selfishness, if put in practice by our elected officials, leads to fascism. Paul doesn't seem to buy the current dictum that 'greed is good.' Later in the film, Harry Brock's lawyer informs him that he can't just go around Washington buying Congresspeople--nearly all of them are hardworking, honest people who take their legislative positions seriously. The comparison between that situation and the current climate of open corruption in Congress is a stark lesson for us all. This sort of political commentary will not be seen again in American films, at least not the Hollywood sort. The fact that this film was a very popular light comedy makes it all the more remarkable. Apparently Americans in the Fifties took their rights for granted, and expected honesty and forthrightness from their elected officials. Journalists like Paul comprised an honest, truth-seeking profession, not mere corporate embeds playing reporter. I enjoyed the film's story, but I was deeply saddened by the depiction of what this country once was, and what we have lost. It's a worthwhile film. See it, if you get the chance.

Queen of the damned on the other hand, was strictly to get the Gen X crowd to see Allyiah in leather and silk, Stuart Townsend shirtless, and Jonathan Davis's original songs..The story was cut to the point it wasn't the same story. Lestat's maker is NOT Marius. Where's Mekare? (the real QUEEN of the damned) Where is Louis? Why wasn't more attention paid to Khayman, who had an important role in the story...Azim...Gabrielle ...Armand, Daniel (The interviewer from Interveiw with the Vampire) Why did the Queen die in that fashion, part of what makes the real ending cool, was the fact that as powerful as the Queen was, she is killed by simple, common, mortal beheading, done as a human would do it with a large sharp pane of glass..Why did it not show the Queen Killing innocent men everywhere she went, as that was her whole purpose for waking, not Lestats music. There was no mention of how Vampires came to be, which is really the true point of the entire Queen of the Damned story. I know they couldn't leave everything in with film time constraints, but they cut out most of the important characters, and almost all of the relevant story. It's pretty, the music is decent. but its not the same story.

And so excited when I put the tape in the video-recorder. I knew about the way cartoons and flesh and blood people interacted with each other in this film, but I was completely unprepared for the experience I was to have.In one of the most ingenious openings for a film, it begins with a cartoon starring Roger Rabbit and Baby Herman. I actually believed it was a genuine cartoon. I had no idea the film had already begun. This cartoon in of itself is a treat. A classic scenario with Baby Herman trying to get to a jar of cookies, throughout the obstacle course of an ordinary kitchen. Roger meanwhile has to save him from the various kitchen knives, rolling pins and live electrical sockets. It's almost vintage Chuck Jones.But the cartoon comes to a halt when Roger has a fridge dropped on his head. And is seeing birds. Then a director yells CUT. A flesh and blood director. He barges onto the set and criticises Roger for blowing his lines again. He should be seeing stars. Not birds. Baby Herman drops his cute, innocent child routine and talks like a grizzled, veteran actor demanding to know what the hell was wrong with that take.I'd never seen anything like it. I felt like I'd been transported into a parallel world. And that's exactly what the filmmakers have tried to create. WFRR was directed by Robert Zemeckis. He already had two hits under his belt, Romancing the Stone and Back to the Future. And it was with BTTF he established his trademark as a director who could work in cutting edge special effects while at the same time telling a good story.With WFRR, Zemeckis accomplished the seemingly impossible task (at the time) of merging the cartoon logic of the animated world with the rules and conventions of the human world. Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins doing a credible American accent), a down on his luck private eye has been hired by Roger's boss, R. K. Maroon to spy on Roger's Toon wife, Jessica (voiced perfectly by an unbilled Kathleen Turner). Rumours are flying around she's fooling about with Marvin Acme, the man who provides the gadgets and gimmicks for the studios cartoons.

But Who Framed Roger Rabbit is much more than that. This is an inspired masterpiece, filled with visual lunacy, smart in-jokes, a tightly plotted story and a lot of laughs. Bob Hoskins is perfect as the seedy gumshoe with a drink problem. He has the unenviable task of sharing most of the screen time with thin air, but he is not put off. In fact Hoskins was a real trooper with some of the things he was asked to do. His interactions with Roger are perfectly integrated, and there is even an odd sort of chemistry between the two.The film is not always about the next sight gag (even though they're always clever and welcome). There are subtle moments too, such as the scene when Valiant is telling Roger about his brother's death, or Roger trying to get Valiant to lighten up. The characterisation exists for both human and Toon. There are numerous references to every type of Warner Bros and Disney cartoon imaginable. That must have been quite a deal they struck, with characters like Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse sharing screen time, or Donald Duck and Daffy Duck sharing a marvellous piano duet that turns into a duel. Some of the references are quite subtle too, such as the penguin waiters from Mary Poppins and the crows from Dumbo appearing in the foreground. One of the joys of Roger Rabbit is just looking out for the next Toon, such as a black and white Betty Boop struggling to find work now that cartoons have gone to colour. That's the first time I've ever felt true poignancy for a cartoon character. Which extends to Roger's plight as well.But the film never loses sight of it's plot. I won't reveal it for those who still haven't had the pleasure of experiencing this truly remarkable film. Another joy is watching the tortuous plot gradually unfold, such as the scene where Valiant visits Toon Town, a neat reversal on the rest of the film. It all ends brilliantly in a gripping climax at the Acme Factory, that combines action, suspense and a lot of slapstick.This is one of the great comedies of our time.

Meanwhile, back in LA her work buddies Chris and Terry continue their investigation into Eddie and come up with some unusual revelations. When they go to check out his corpses, the body is gone.I don't know, but never really got the hype that surrounded this flick. The first time I watched it was somewhat unsatisfied. The next time it was slightly better, but I just couldn't put my finger on why its held up so high, as again I was still left a little unimpressed. So, third time around&#133; my thoughts are still the same, but I probably got a bit more from it now than from my previous two viewings. That's not to say I think now it's a grand piece of entertainment, more so a mildly riveting exercise that has it's pluses and minuses.The film paired up director Joe Dante and screen writer John Sayles again, after their collaboration in the incredibly witty, 'Jaws' knock-off Piranha (1978). The Howling goes for a sinister outlook in its contemporary take on the werewolf genre and Sayles' thoughtful script steers mostly away from the clichés associated with Hollywood werewolf films. Here it sticks with the true mythology (being able to shape shift whenever) of the lycanthropy. The one thing that sticks out like a sore thumb is the overabundance of in-jokes, satirical humour and references to old flicks. The sharply, sardonic humour seemed to hold a great rapport with the seriously morbid approach Dante went for here. What did get on my nerves though, was the plodding mid-section, which just didn't draw me in like I hoped. Well, I actually found the sub-plot with Chris and Terry investigating Eddie to be far more interesting with some unexpected developments than the main focus on the leadenly, dramatised interactions between Karen and her husband Bill with the strange occurrences at the medical retreat.After the relentlessly, seedy atmospheric build up within the first ten minutes, the story slowly dragged for quite a bit. That's until it makes way for an anxiety packed final half hour with one or two memorably, jarring scenes. Although, I found the climax somewhat anti-climatic. When it wants to be suspenseful, it is. I just wish there was more of it. Since the undeniably grimy atmosphere is perfectly, high on mood and when it shifts to its forebodingly, foggy woodlands its hard to escape the nightmarish feel, especially at night with eerie howling. The scenery is simply top-notch. Now I just wish the characters followed the same suit. Honestly they were mostly a unlikable lot that I didn't I care for one bit. Actually, I enjoyed the support roles more than I did of the leads. Belinda Belaski and Dennis Dugan as Terry and Chris were sturdy in their performances and gave their characters a little bit of solidarity. Robert Picardo nails it down as the slithering, monstrous Eddie Quist. There's a neat cameo from Dick Millar too. But the rest just didn't do anything for me. Dee Wallace was rather unconvincing and predictably uneven in her performance I thought. The same for Christopher Stone as her husband Bill Neill. Patrick Macnee seems lost at sea as Dr. George Waggner.What made the film has got to be the cracking special effects by Rob Bottin! I really liked the towering werewolf designs. But it was the transformations that caught the eye with the repulsively, petrifying body morphing. The convincing detail that went into it is exceptional, but I thought at times it did take away from the overall effect by going on for just too long. The light in those scenes and sometimes other sequences was extremely poor I thought. Even the editing is kind of choppy and there's a odd inventive camera shot amongst the orthodox frame shots. Sometimes I thought the zooms got to close to the action, where we don't always get a good look of what's happening. But the score just felt out-of-place and basically corny. The film does have a sleazy tone and there's a grisly werewolf attack here and there.Even though I found The Howling to be rather unsavoury as a whole, but there's a definite backbone that holds the film together with its wry humour and gruesome make-up effects.

Nor did I care for it as much as her other comedy romances (most notably Notting Hill) or most of the Meg Ryan ones, especially Sleepless in Seattle.The story revolves around a lovely young woman, Maggie Carpenter, who has left a series of three would be grooms partway through their wedding ceremony. A reporter named Ike Graham gets fired after writing an exaggerated article of half truths on her story, so to salvage his career, he travels to her small hometown, where he attempts to ferret out her true tale and get the scoop on her upcoming fourth nuptials. Needless to say, Ike does not prove very popular with his journalistic subject, Maggie, as he harasses her family & friends for info. However, he begins to feel protective of her when townsfolk mock her track record of jilting her fiancé at the altar.Julia Roberts is invariably appealing & sympathetic in her roles, and typically this proves true in her portrayal here of Maggie. Richard Gere is competent as the journalistic vulture, Ike. I don't fault the lack of chemistry as much as the story, which simply isn't as good as Pretty Woman.Of course romantic comedies are never exactly bastions of realism, but this tale where such a young woman has already run away from three weddings and is now embarking upon number four, really seems too far fetched even for this genre. One would suspect that any prospective groom would be quite leery by now, and why does Maggie keep planning these gala ceremonies if she suspects she might ultimately get cold feet? All in all, it's a cute, light hearted, & entertaining movie with some good scenes, but definitely not the best of its genre.

Rarely in the history of mankind have we seen a movie so incredibly awful that it becomes a must-see film. And, interestingly enough, this film is one of four from 1979-1980 that I have reviewed that all fall into this same category. To what do we owe this honor? Well, 1979-1980, for those of you who are blessed to be too young to remember it, was time of the last gasp of disco AND the short-lived roller-disco craze. And, all four horrible movies I strongly recommend are so bad, so stupid, so over-the-top bad that they are truly must-see films for bad movie fans. So here is my list of the unholy 4--XANADU, ROLLER BOOGIE, THE APPLE and CAN'T STOP THE MUSIC. All four are chock full of disco as well as crappy dialog and minimal production values. My vote for most awful of these is the sci-fi, disco, religious epic THE APPLE, but any of the four is strongly recommended for a good laugh! Now, for the specifics on CAN'T STOP THE MUSIC--which, when you watch it you may want to re-name CAN'T STOP THE RETCHING. Back in 1980, the least well-kept secret in America was the fact that the Village People were gay. Believe it or not, many Americans who loved their music lived in complete denial that these were six gay men from Greenwich Village. Well, all doubt and ambiguity is erased in this film! While a few times in the movie, the ultra-horny character, Lulu, makes very clumsy passes at these guys, the long, over-the-top and strongly homo-erotic music videos within the movie make it obvious these men were quite gay--and this is especially true of their rendition of YMCA--which looks sort of like a gay version of Heaven. In fact, the campiness of the movie is sort of like a combination of Liberace with gay disco--with the most flamboyant and silly sets and costumes you'll see outside of a gay pride march. BUT, despite the singing being so incredibly overdone and campy, it actually works in some cases as you'll probably find yourself tapping your feet and getting into the songs--or at least some of them. They are BAD, yes, but still kinda fun at the same time. The final song, CAN'T STOP THE MUSIC, initially is very catchy as well, but goes on and on and on and on until you are nearly ready to go berserk! So, if the music is strange but not THAT bad, why did I give the movie a 2? Well, that's because when they are not singing, the members of The Village People have very little to say and absolutely no charisma because they are not actors. So, they fill in this gap by having real actors(?) do almost all the dialog. And, for the most part, they assembled the absolute worst actors Hollywood had to offer!! So, the main problem with the movie rests not on the Village People but on everything else about the movie!! To help illustrate HOW bad the acting is, one of the big stars for the movie is a very young and obnoxious Steve Guttenburg! He is assisted by the pleasantly built but incredibly bland Valerie Perrine and the ultra-wooden Bruce Jenner!!! This movie, in fact, single-handedly ruined Jenner's bid to become a serious actor, as he had all the personality and chemistry of Mr. Potatohead.Now, so far this movie offers us one music video after another (many with very gay visuals that will make a few uncomfortable but most just laugh), horrible acting and dialog, a dopey story and wretched direction by Nancy Walker (yes, the Bounty commercial woman). And, when you put them all together you have a movie that is even worse than a sum of all its parts--so bad, that you'll most likely laugh yourself silly and have great time making fun of the ineptness of the film.

Its main characters believe that uninhibited folk who feel free to go about their house nude in front of their kids represent a more enlightened form of humanity than the more modest (sexually repressed?). In this era where child molestation by step fathers & live in boyfriends is all too common, it casts the boyfriend's admittedly well intended behaviour in a sympathetic light; he's the misunderstood & tarnished victim of the piece. My main complaint, however, is that the film supports the misguided notion that this wonderful new sexual discovery this mother is experiencing should be at least as important in her life as her child.The story revolves around a laboratory worker & part time piano teacher, Anna, who is divorced from her husband, Brian, a lawyer, and has custody of their young daughter, Molly. Anna embarks upon a passionate affair with Leo, a sculptor, and basks in her newfound sexual discovery. One day Molly curiously & innocently inquires whether she might touch Leo's penis. He consents, so as to convey to her that there is nothing shameful or embarrassing about one's body. However, the ex-husband, Brian, learns of the event and sues for custody, declaring Anna an unfit mother. The acting is superb, with Diane Keaton compelling as Anna and Liam Neeson charismatic & appealing as the bohemian Irish lover, Leo.True, no one in this story means any harm, with the possible exception of Brian who may simply be vindictive. On the other hand, what father in his right mind wouldn't sue for custody if confronted with this tale? It is indeed heart wrenching that Anna loses custody of the daughter she dearly loves, but frankly, she put her own sexual fulfillment ahead of her maternal role. Call me old fashioned, but I have a BIG problem with lovers living in or boyfriends sleeping over in any case, but especially where children are involved. Anna & Leo definitely shouldn't be having sex in the same bed with Molly, whether she's sleeping or not. Leo is kind to Molly, but his behaviour here is ill advised at best, and one cannot blame the courts for coming down on the side of the situation's obvious appearance. There are certainly wonderful step people so I don't want to tar everyone with the same brush, but there's also far too much child molestation going on in second marriages & love relationships. The biological parent must assume absolute responsibility for ensuring that their new love interest isn't victimizing their child. Leo is perfectly innocent here, but Anna hasn't known him long and she's pretty trusting in leaving him alone with her little girl. Frankly, if mothers were a little less trusting of their new boyfriends AND PUT THEIR CHILD FIRST, there might be a lot less abuse going on.As another noted, I think the moral of the story is that if the mother wants to live a bohemian lifestyle, she should be very leery of involving her child. Frankly as I see it, unlike the 'Me first' philosophy of modern society, a 'good mother' is willing to make some sacrifices and most definitely puts the interests of her child ahead of her own love life. That's not true here of Anna, who's totally caught up in her newfound passions and alas, pays the price. This is NOT a movie that doesn't provide a viewpoint, as another has claimed. It DOES have a viewpoint. The producers' obvious intent here is to have the viewer totally sympathize with Anna, this caring & dedicated mother, and to see both her & her misunderstood lover as the tragic victims of injustice. As always, the real victim here is the child.

James Mason plays Phillip Vandamm, the international criminal who believes that Thornhill works for the U.S. government and desperately wants to kill him. Eve Marie Saint is Eve, a mysterious woman who helps Roger but has a secret agenda of her own.It is obvious that Hitchcock wanted to pleasure his audience after the mixed reviews he received in Vertigo, as he gives thrill after thrill in this roller-coaster but always with class and elegance. Thornhill goes from one peril to another and the suspense is always on the rise. Also, his dark humor returns and Cary Grant definitely is the best man to deliver it.Cary Grant is perfect as Roger Thornhill, and it is probably the role of his lifetime. It is very well known the fact that James Stewart was the first choice but was rejected after the failure of Vertigo. Even when personally I consider Stewart a better actor, Cary Grant was the perfect actor for the lighter Hitchcock; with his suave persona, good humor and classy elegance, Grant shines here as well as in suspicion and To Catch a Thief.

His perfect camera-work and the score by the always effective Bernard Herrmann created immortal scenes.

The poker dialoge went a little over my head, but even I understood the gist of what was going on. Its the characters not the poker that makes this movie so good in my opinion. It starts out with Mike Mcdermont a young man with incredible card playing talent( Matt Damon) going to play Texas hold em with a Russian mobster named Teddy KGB ( played hilariously by one of my personal favorites John Malkovich). Mike losses 30,000 dollars, his rent money, case money, and tuition for law school. After such a bad beat he quits poker and goes to work for Joey Knish( a fellow card player who is Mikes friend and mentor) driving a delivery truck. Mike is doing good, going to school and making an honest living. That is until his best bud Lester Worm Murphy is released from prison. Mike goes to pick him up and Worm has Mike playing poker that very night, scamming some young trust fund babies. Worm is eager to start playing poker as soon as he gets out, and we find out that it is because he owes like 15,000 dollars to various loan sharks. Mike not wanting his friend to take a beating( which the scumnbag deserves) vouches for Worm and together they try to come up with the money. Worm ends up getting him and Mike in loads of trouble, leaving Mike to fend for himself Now like I said the characters are what makes this movie so great. Matt Damon is great as a young man who has dreams and wants to follow them(playing in the World Series of Poker). You truly believe his poker ability. Edward Norton is my personal favorite. Worm just lights up the screen.He has almost the same amount of true poker skills as Mike, but he prefers to cheat because he says it gives him an edge. Most people who see this movie hate the character( for good reason...he is cheap and slimy) but not me. I actually feel sorry for him not only because he gets the crap beat out of him sometimes but also because he has no direction unlike Mike. He has no idea what he wants to do with his life. I just wish he would have taken up for himself more. There is one scene when one of the loan sharks beats up Worm in the back room of a strip club. Now Worm is skinny yes, but skinny guys can fight too. The whole time he is being pushed around I am wanting to go through the television and tell him to throw a few punches too, fight back. Also it leaves you hanging at the end, Mike leaves Worm after they get beat up by some off duty cops that Worm was trying to scam. It never tells you what happened to Worm. Did he leave town? Did the loan sharks get to him? They spend a lot of the movie developing Worms story and then they just kind of leave it unfinished at the end. The one thing I didn't like was Mikes girlfriend Joe, can you say bitchy. She is two dimensional and needs to trust the man she supposdly loves. Othe then that great movie. I give it a 10.

She obviously found the perfect vehicle in Pat Conroy's epic novel about Tom Wingo, a Southerner whose failing marriage and career reflect a deep suppression of an abusive childhood, the memories of which are triggered by his twin sister's suicide attempt. That the story revolves around a man's personal crisis versus a woman's may strike some as odd given Streisand's particularly female perspective, but she actually makes Tom's complex personal journey resonate with greater sensitivity as a result. In fact, the emotionalism Streisand invests in her musical performances is very much in evidence here, and her lush, almost Baroque style fits the contours of this soap opera very well.The 1991 movie is helped immeasurably by a galvanizing performance from Nick Nolte, who captures all the layers of pride, regret, anger, sadness and humiliation in his character. He propels the storyline with the unbridled passion of an actor sinking his teeth into a juicy part as only a female director could define it. In fact, Streisand steps back to play the subordinate role of Dr. Susan Lowenstein, the pricey New York psychiatrist treating Tom's sister, Savannah. Granted, she does make herself rather beatific even in her high skirts and flimsy blouses, but such expectations come with Streisand as she basically plays Tom's savior. At the same time, it is probably her most subtle work on screen even with the touches of excess that often detract from her performances. She also hands out plum parts to both the wonderful Kate Nelligan, who gets to age convincingly as Tom's upwardly driven mother with a dark secret, and Blythe Danner, dependably effective as Tom's conflicted wife. Both especially excel in their revelatory conversations with Tom, the dialogue insightful without delving too much into psychobabble. Credit should be given to Conroy and Betsy Johnston, who wrote the superb screenplay. Melinda Dillon has little to do as Savannah except look traumatized, which she does well. And in a not too subtle display of nepotism, Streisand's son, Jason Gould, sullenly plays the doctor's son, a musician-in-training who is coached on the finer points of football by Tom.The movie is not without flaws. First, there is a critical scene where Tom confesses to Lowenstein (as Tom calls her) what exactly happened in his childhood that none of the Wingos have been willing or able to share with anyone else. Because of Streisand's effective juxtaposition of the long-ago violent crime with the present-day therapy session and Nolte's superb work, this is an especially powerful sequence. It feels climactic in nature given the depth of the catharsis we have been presented at that point, but the problem is that it comes about 45 minutes before the end of the movie. It is around this point that the story shifts to an inevitable affair between Tom and Lowenstein following a tense, pretentious dinner party with Jeroen Krabbe holding court as her psychologically abusive husband, a world renowned violinist out to humiliate Tom. Consequently, we are given a flagrant detour into Lowenstein's own catharsis, which brings up valid questions about her character's professionalism in even having an intimate relationship with a patient. This part of the story is Streisand at her most self-indulgent as both director and actor, as we follow these two smitten people on gauzy romantic walks and sweaty lovemaking by candlelight. Luckily the film recovers toward the end before any serious damage is done. Special mention should be made of the beautiful cinematography by Stephen Goldblatt, who perfectly captures the burnished aura of the lowlands of South Carolina, and the symphonic, often swooning score by James Newton-Howard. It's an impressive accomplishment to translate Conroy's lengthy, often florid narrative into a cohesive movie that retains the major themes of its source material, and Streisand has done a splendid job in pulling it all together.

It is basically the story of old geezers (sometimes foul mouthed ones) who argue, insult each other, and talk a lot about sex. It could have been a really cute, hilarious, touching, and sentimental tale but alas, for the most part, it's not. Frankly, I felt as though this film and its sequel were beneath the dignity of its three talented and now, sadly, deceased stars...Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, & Burgess Meredith, especially the amazing Lemmon. The story revolves around two neighbours, John & Gus, who have been feuding since childhood. Their quarrels escalate when an attractive widow, Ariel, moves next door and the pair vie for her affections. I couldn't help asking myself...what woman in her right mind would be attracted to either one of these cranky old idiots? Are there no more likely eligible men in the neighbourhood?The quarrelsome duo are played by those two comedic pros, Jack Lemmon (John) and Walter Matthau (Gus). However, this is not another version of their wonderful old comedy, The Odd Couple. Not much here is all that amusing, clever, or touching, and those instances which are have been ruined (at least for me) by a sort of pervading dirty atmosphere. Ariel is portrayed adequately enough by Ann-Margaret, but it's just not a very compelling role. By far the most obnoxious of all is Burgess Meredith as the dirty talking reprobate, Grandpa Gustafson (John's father). I will kindly refrain from getting nasty here about his role (as I would certainly be inclined to do) as unfortunately this actor has since passed away. Suffice it to say, I find foul mouthed old gaffers neither particularly amusing nor endearing.Yes, there's ice fishing, a few funny pranks, and a touching genuine underlying affection & friendship between this pair of coots, but it's basically a great movie only if you like dirty jokes revolving around old gents. If you do, you'll love the movie...simple as that. Obviously, many would agree as it seems relatively popular and I notice has received a reasonable rating here. They even went on to make a sequel (horrors!) called Grumpier Old Men, which I wisely decided to forgo. Pity I hadn't been smart enough to forgo the original as well. Actually, it was presented as viewing entertainment at someone else's home and I wanted to be polite; otherwise I would certainly have turned it off long before the end. We should all remember these three wonderful actors fondly, but at least for myself, best to forget these particular roles.

Rex leaving Saskia alone walks to the nearest gas station to get a jerry can of gasoline. Coming back to the stranded car Rex doesn't find Saskia and getting in the car and driving out of the tunnel he sees her waiting for him outside. You get the impression that the two are on the outs but later their back together as if nothing happened but something terrible is about to happen to them and it's strikes the unsuspecting couple at a time and place that they would least expect it to.Stopping at a crowded gas-station and food rest stop Saskia leaves Rex for what would be just a moment to buy some refreshments and is never seen or heard from again. It's as if she just stepped off the face of the earth and fell into a black hole in space. Based on the Tim Krabbe novel The Golden Egg the film The Vanishing is about how a person can come up with, and execute, the most evil acts imaginable and at the same time come across totally normal to not only himself but to everyone around him.Raymond Lemorne, Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu, is a loving family man and chemistry professor but suffers from an obsession of wanting to know if the sick acts that his mind conjurer's up can also be put into practice. Since he was 16 Lemorne has had thoughts of committing murder just to see how it feels. Now in his mid 30's he's about to make his wish come true at the expense of Saskia Wagter but what he didn't expect is how it would effect her friend and lover Rex Hoffman.We know from the start that Lemorne was somehow responsible for Saskia's disappearance seeing him hanging around the gas station eying her, as well as a number of other young women, before she vanished. It was the three or so years after Siskia's vanishing that got to the morbid and deranged Lemorne working overtime. It was Rex not letting Saskia's name out of the news that somehow started to get under Lemorne's skin.Finally getting up enough courage to finally face Rex back in Holland showing him proof, Saskia's car-keys, and then getting his a** kicked in among other things. Lemeorne then gets the now somewhat sedated and curious young man to drive back with him to France to the gas station where Saskia was last seen alive by him some three years ago. We get a chilling minute-by-minute flashback to what happened to Saskia at the gas station from Lemorne himself as he cleverly got her to get in his car, in a crowded area in broad daylight, and then knocking her out with a chloroform-laced handkerchief and driving off with her.Rex desperately wanting to find out from Lemorne what happened to Saskia goes along with his sick game of cat and mouse that leads to this dark and deserted park outside a gas station. It's where where Lemorne gives him a cup of coffee laced with sleeping pills to put Rex, who willingly goes along with it, into the same condition that he put Saskia in three years ago. Rex at first hesitates but his curiosity gets the best of him and drinks the brew falling into a deep sleep and when he awakes he finds out the truth of what happened to his beloved Saskia but at the cost of his life.Not at all pleasant to watch The Vanishing is the kind of movie that leaves you both physically and mentally numb and is undoubtedly one of the most chilling horror films to come out in the last fifty or so years; rivaling such horror classics of the 1960's and 1970's like Psycho and The Exorcist. The fact that The Vanishing is so unconventional in it's story-line and has such unique characters in it that it's for that and that very reason alone, more then anything else, the movie has had over the years such a disturbing and devastating effect on it's audiences.

It's as if she just stepped off the face of the earth and fell into a black hole in space. Based on the Tim Krabbe novel The Golden Egg the film The Vanishing is about how a person can come up with, and execute, the most evil acts imaginable and at the same time come across totally normal to not only himself but to everyone around him.Raymond Lemorne, Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu, is a loving family man and chemistry professor but suffers from an obsession of wanting to know if the sick acts that his mind conjurer's up can also be put into practice.

Now in his mid 30's he's about to make his wish come true at the expense of Saskia Wagter but what he didn't expect is how it would effect her friend and lover Rex Hoffman.We know from the start that Lemorne was somehow responsible for Saskia's disappearance seeing him hanging around the gas station eying her, as well as a number of other young women, before she vanished. It was the three or so years after Siskia's vanishing that got to the morbid and deranged Lemorne working overtime. It was Rex not letting Saskia's name out of the news that somehow started to get under Lemorne's skin.Finally getting up enough courage to finally face Rex back in Holland showing him proof, Saskia's car-keys, and then getting his a** kicked in among other things. Lemeorne then gets the now somewhat sedated and curious young man to drive back with him to France to the gas station where Saskia was last seen alive by him some three years ago. We get a chilling minute-by-minute flashback to what happened to Saskia at the gas station from Lemorne himself as he cleverly got her to get in his car, in a crowded area in broad daylight, and then knocking her out with a chloroform-laced handkerchief and driving off with her.Rex desperately wanting to find out from Lemorne what happened to Saskia goes along with his sick game of cat and mouse that leads to this dark and deserted park outside a gas station. It's where where Lemorne gives him a cup of coffee laced with sleeping pills to put Rex, who willingly goes along with it, into the same condition that he put Saskia in three years ago. Rex at first hesitates but his curiosity gets the best of him and drinks the brew falling into a deep sleep and when he awakes he finds out the truth of what happened to his beloved Saskia but at the cost of his life.Not at all pleasant to watch The Vanishing is the kind of movie that leaves you both physically and mentally numb and is undoubtedly one of the most chilling horror films to come out in the last fifty or so years; rivaling such horror classics of the 1960's and 1970's like Psycho and The Exorcist.

But I was determined to find and read the novel beforehand, to learn less-known information about the most famous vampire...I almost regret doing this now (almost because if I hadn't I would've liked the film a bit more since, though I found it confusing WITH the book, so without it would've left me baffled but still entertained) because my experience of watching this was tainted. For those who don't know the novel's plot Jonathan Harker is sent to Transylvania to see a mysterious client of his company's, and there notices many odd things about Dracula he neither dines, drinks, nor reflects in mirrors, seems to covet human blood until prevented with a crucifix, is nearly nocturnal, seems to summon his neighboring wolves who prevent Jonathan from leaving, and intercepts 2 letters he sends home via gypsies and burns the one written to his lover Mina since it's shorthand. While defying his host's orders to sleep nowhere but his own room, he encounters 3 women who appear to be demons they nearly attack him till Dracula offers them a child. As he recovers from a brain fever in a nearby mental hospital, Mina Murray and Lucy Westenra witness a ship enter port whose only occupants are the captain, dead with crucifix-tied hands, whose journal mysteriously hints something caused his crew's disappearance, and a gray dog who flees after landing. Shortly after, Lucy's sleepwalking finds her nearly attacked by something unidentifiable to Mina, who believes the 2 marks on Lucy's throat are from the pin she used to tie her shawl - though Dr. Van Helsing, friend of Lucy's suitor Dr. John Steward, believes it's more when she continues to weaken after being given 4 blood transfers. After death her wounds heal, and Van Helsing reveals to Steward and her fiancée Arthur Holmwood that she is un-dead. With another of Lucy's suitors, Quincey Morris, Van Helsing summons Mina and Jonathan to confront the vampire responsible, and attempts to question Steward's insane patient Renfield, who appears subservient to a vampire - and must save Mina when she's attacked. The movie leaves out and\/or changes much of the plot - Renfield is the business worker who goes to meet Dracula but returns possessed with him via ship. Jack Steward is Mina's father and her lover John Harker is too practical to believe in vampires, Lucy Weston is barely introduced and is interested in Dracula whom she actually meets, Arthur and Quincey are absent - and the suspense is reduced by Dracula's directly socializing with the protagonists in London rather than their having to hunt him down across the Black Sea, such as Van Helsing fighting his hypnosis in a battle of wits which occurs before he can convince anyone around him of what Dracula truly is. The Count's true identity - a descendant of an old Transylvanian family\/Turkish War veteran who practiced witchcraft - was never revealed. Even Renfield's death is pitiful as he falls downstairs rather than dying directly from a beating. I was bored and managed to forget the ending, of 1 of the greatest horror films of all time, no less. I can safely say that if it hadn't been for Bram Stoker's work, I'd have been confused by the hurried plot, so even on its own merits - I try to give at least 5 stars to be fair - this film wasn't enjoyable to me.

Did he succeed? In the eyes of most critics, no. However, I applaud Mr. Spielberg for an admirable effort and creating another crowd-pleaser, even if it didn't match up to the high expectations.On another personal note, I was very happy to see Jeff Goldblum reprise his role as Dr. Ian Malcolm as he has always been my favorite character in the series. Since Malcolm is now more aware of the dangers of John Hammond's activities, his personality is less goofy and more serious this time around compared to his previous adventure.It took several viewings for me to appreciate this film to its fullest. At first, it seemed weak because it sacrificed the philosophical messages that helped make the first film great to fit in more action. The philosophy is found in one of the key quotes by John Hammond. Life will find a way. There *is* a point to all the chaos because it is all caused by the humans and their relentless desire to interfere with nature. Every tragic event seen in the film could have been avoided with sensibility and that is the message that is echoed throughout the entire series. Don't attempt to control the uncontrollable.If there's one thing that makes the film worth watching, it has to be the special effects and the dinosaur animatronics. The infant T-Rex featured in this film is so lifelike that I often had to remind myself that it wasn't a real dinosaur.

Considering all the talent involved in making Hannibal, the results should have been excellent. Perhaps the biggest problem was with the source material. Thomas Harris did not hit a home run with his third novel dealing with Hannibal Lecter. The plot was convoluted, completely unrealistic, and almost completely obscured by the author's attempt to dazzle the reader with how much he knows about Florence, Italy. The script was re-written fifteen times. Three endings were filmed. Jodie Foster and Johnathan Demme backed out amidst the chaos. The final result has none of the magic of Silence of the Lambs or even Manhunter. Hopkins is still there, and he's a thrill to watch particularly during the scenes in Italy. Hopkins was originally skeptical of portraying Lecter once again, but it's amazing what $15 million will convince a man to do.The story picks up a few years after SOTL left off. Lecter has settled in Italy while Agent Starling is busy fighting crime with the FBI back home. An Italian detective finds out Lecter is working in a local museum and plans to hand him over to an old victim rather than arrest him. The former victim (a grossly disfigured Gary Oldman) is a wealthy sadist confined to a wheelchair on his sprawling estate. His plan is to feed Lecter to a pack of wild pigs that have been specially raised for just this event!!! Yes! It's amazing what those rich sadists will come up with when they're looking for revenge. After the detective fails to capture Lecter in Italy, Lecter heads on back to the USA to apparently try and hook up with Agent Starling who he has a thing for. Starling is trying to capture Lecter and prevent his former victim from murdering him. As you can see, the plot is ripe for any criticism one wishes to throw its way. The action plays out well in some scenes, but poorly during the latter half hour when it mattered the most.A big problem this film has is with its moralizing attitude it takes with Lecter. We are actually supposed to care about this brutal murderer of god knows how many people. We are supposed to sit and either laugh or cheer when he feeds Ray Liotta's own brains to him. The rich man trying to kill Lecter is painted as a man who would be better off dead himself, so we'd better hope Lecter gets away! The book is even more guilty of this moralizing by detailing Lecter's difficult childhood and pointing out how he only kills people who are rude. Overall, it just doesn't work when your main character is an evil murderer. With SOTL and Manhunter, we had a serial killer on the outside who needed to be stopped. This film acts like things are fine and dandy with Lecter on the outside.Julianne Moore is a fine actress, but she's badly miscast here as Starling. It's nice to see Ray Liotta working again, but this part really did nothing for him, either. This film was obviously a mess from the get-go, but I'd blame Thomas Harris more than anyone else.

The script was re-written fifteen times. Three endings were filmed. Jodie Foster and Johnathan Demme backed out amidst the chaos. The final result has none of the magic of Silence of the Lambs or even Manhunter. Hopkins is still there, and he's a thrill to watch particularly during the scenes in Italy. Hopkins was originally skeptical of portraying Lecter once again, but it's amazing what $15 million will convince a man to do.The story picks up a few years after SOTL left off. Lecter has settled in Italy while Agent Starling is busy fighting crime with the FBI back home. An Italian detective finds out Lecter is working in a local museum and plans to hand him over to an old victim rather than arrest him. The former victim (a grossly disfigured Gary Oldman) is a wealthy sadist confined to a wheelchair on his sprawling estate. His plan is to feed Lecter to a pack of wild pigs that have been specially raised for just this event!!! Yes! It's amazing what those rich sadists will come up with when they're looking for revenge. After the detective fails to capture Lecter in Italy, Lecter heads on back to the USA to apparently try and hook up with Agent Starling who he has a thing for. Starling is trying to capture Lecter and prevent his former victim from murdering him. As you can see, the plot is ripe for any criticism one wishes to throw its way. The action plays out well in some scenes, but poorly during the latter half hour when it mattered the most.A big problem this film has is with its moralizing attitude it takes with Lecter. We are actually supposed to care about this brutal murderer of god knows how many people. We are supposed to sit and either laugh or cheer when he feeds Ray Liotta's own brains to him. The rich man trying to kill Lecter is painted as a man who would be better off dead himself, so we'd better hope Lecter gets away! The book is even more guilty of this moralizing by detailing Lecter's difficult childhood and pointing out how he only kills people who are rude. Overall, it just doesn't work when your main character is an evil murderer. With SOTL and Manhunter, we had a serial killer on the outside who needed to be stopped. This film acts like things are fine and dandy with Lecter on the outside.Julianne Moore is a fine actress, but she's badly miscast here as Starling. It's nice to see Ray Liotta working again, but this part really did nothing for him, either. This film was obviously a mess from the get-go, but I'd blame Thomas Harris more than anyone else. He gave us a novel that just could not be made into a very good film.5 of 10 stars.The Hound. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"}]
