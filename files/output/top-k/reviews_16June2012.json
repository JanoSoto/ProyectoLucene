The film is directed by Don Taylor, and stars Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Sal Mineo, Bradford Dillman, Ricardo Montalban, Natalie Trundy, Eric Braeden, William Windom, John Randolph, and M. Emmet Walsh.It is part III of the Ape Series, however, the film doesn't require the viewer to see the previous other Ape films to understand what's going on, but I think it helps to see the other two so you can fully understand the character's motives and thoughts.THE PLOT - Three highly intelligent humanoid Chimpanzees from outer space land on planet Earth in the Pacific coast in 1973 via their space ship. They are taken by the authorities to the Los Angeles Zoo. At first, the Apes are seen as a novelty and become famous and loved through out the world, but soon, they are perceived as a threat to all of mankind and planet Earth. The film starts off as being a light family comedy, but takes a very dark turn.MY THOUGHTS - Like the previous Ape films, Escape has parables that address social issues that were going on in the world at that time. The year was 1971 when the film was released, right when racial segregation was ending, and Black and White people were starting to live and work amongst each other as equals. I believe the film is suggesting to the audience that accepting those who are different from you and giving them a chance might not be a bad idea, and that you shouldn't believe everything you hear about people.The film is anti-racist, and also has an anti-abortion theme to it, and has somewhat of an anti-government theme to it as well, and addresses the issue of government intrusion. Some of the other topics include scientific experimentation on animals, and nuclear war.One of the many reasons why I like this film because it makes me appreciate what I have. The chimps come to 1973 and our just amazed at the technology. It makes me not take for granted what we have. I sometimes think how someone from the 1860's would react to the things we have in 2015, and they'd most likely be highly impressed, and their reaction makes me realize how lucky we have it, and that we shouldn't take what we have for granted, and enjoy it to the fullest. We really have no excuse for ever being bored.In this film, Cornelius and Zira take center stage, and become the stars, which I enjoyed because I liked both characters a lot in the first two Ape films. The film is a bit of a love story as well, because what Cornelius and Zira are going through in this film is not easy, and only their love for each other is what keeps them going strong.Another cool thing about this film is the reverse it took - In the first two Ape films, we see human beings land on a Planet of Apes where Apes rule, and humans are treated like animals, and we see how those men respond to it. In this film, we see Apes from that same planet land in the U.S.A. in 1973 where humans rule, and Apes are kept in cages, and we see their responses to it.I think the film and the whole Ape series is making a point that any corrupt system - whether run by White or Black people or anyone else of any color is wrong. That no group is superior to the other, and that we are all equal, and if peace is really desired, we should learn to accept one another, and not abuse any power we are given, and that only suffering will lead to any abuse of power.FINAL THOUGHTS - This is one of those films that get different responses from different people. It presents hard questions of morals such as If you could go back in time and kill Adolf Hitler's mother while she was pregnant with him, would you?

The Vietnam War was slowly coming to an end, the civil rights moment had been a success, and black power was taking over the U.S.A. Conquest of the Planet of the Apes was directed by J. Lee Thompson, and stars Roddy McDowall, Ricardo Montalban, Don Murray, Natalie Trundy, Hari Rhodes, Severn Darden, and Lou Wagner. It is part IV of the Ape Series. This is a sequel that I think requires the viewer to at least see part III to fully understand what's going on in part IV. You won't be completely confused if you're a first time Ape viewer since part of the history of the Apes films is covered in this film. The story takes place in 1991. We the audience learn that eight years earlier in the year 1983, a disease killed all the cats and dogs, leaving human beings with no pets. To replace them, people took in Apes as their pets. Because the Apes have so much intelligence, humans train them to perform chores and run errands. By 1991, the very foundation of the United States of America is based on the backbone of Ape slave labor, proving that those who forget history are doomed to repeat it. However, in the minds of most of the humans, this is different. Yes, the U.S. Constitution says All Men are Created Equal, but it says no such things about Apes. Clearly the majority of Americans in this film just cannot let go of the concept of slavery. Since they lost their human slaves over a hundred years earlier, things can now get back to normal for American society by coercing Apes to replace their human slaves. While Apes are smart, they are still just animals, and are not entitled to the same rights as humans. At least this is how many of the humans in the film think. The state is run with a strict hand by a man named Governor Breck who has no mercy on the Apes. Circus owner Armando and a young circus chimpanzee named Caesar go to a local city to promote Armando's circus. Caesar is highly intelligent, and knows how to talk. He has spent his entire life sheltered, and living in safety with Armando. When he goes to the city, and see's how Apes are treated, he finds this to be highly upsetting. Armando warns Caesar not to speak, or otherwise, Caesar could be enslaved. Can Caesar hold in his anger? MY THOUGHTS - The film presents a clear case against animal cruelty, and it has so many parables that I could ramble for hours discussing them, and dissecting them, so I'll only discuss the White\/Black issue that is clearly present in Conquest. I've had the displeasure of having conversations with White Supremacists and Black Supremacists before. It's interesting how both groups have two things in common - They are both racist, and plenty of them are fans of the Planet of the Apes films. For the Black Supremacists, the films serve as a Black Man's fantasy of getting revenge against White men. For the White Supremacists, the films serve as a warning to White people that if they do not control Black people, they could rise up against them. I mentioned The Birth of a Nation in my title - For the unaware, The Birth of a Nation was a black and white silent film from 1915. The second half of that film is about White men forming the KKK and rising up against the former slaves who had taken over the South. I believe this film is in a sense a response to it - It shows the audience exactly why any group of slaves would be angry, and would have no mercy on their former masters, but also presents the question - Is it still morally right to react with so much violence and hate? Conquest completely mirrors the original Planet of the Apes, only the roles between Apes and humans are reversed. Conquest is by far the most darkest and most disturbing of the Apes films. Some may argue that this film is anti-white, and stereotypes white men as all being dominating, heartless, power-hungry monsters. On that note, one of the reasons I think that Conquest is so much emotionally darker then the other Ape films is because we the audience are so use to seeing White men in charge, in both films, and in real life, that perhaps it's less-disturbing seeing them in a slave role like we saw in the first two Apes films, but in Conquest, we are treated to a subconscious *disturbing* reminder of how the U.S.A. use to be when it had human slaves. I also could not help but think of Nazi-Germany when watching this film. That's another thing about Conquest - It's not dated, and can still easily spark controversial discussions about human rights.

This film gets a lot of criticism, mainly for being to comedic or not scary. There always will be a debate over people who don't like the comedic Freddy vs those who like his wise quacks. Personally the wise quacks don't bother me too much and as Mr.Englund once said the humor was always there and that's true. In the 1st film Freddy had a dark humor like tonguing Nancy over the phone. But Englund also said he and the director might'eve went overboard with the humor in this one, which I kinda agree with but the reason is because director\/writer Rachel Talalay said she felt the last film was too dark and wanted to make her film lighter. However I overall like this film because I think it's well directed, has some really interesting ideas and does a good job at ending the series. What I like most about this movie is that it does a good job at answering a lot of questions like how do you kill Freddy for good? what would Freddy do if he killed all the kids in the town? and how did he get the power to enter people dreams? I think the film does a really job at answering those questions and every Freddy fan like myself should be satisfied with what they came up with. The film is well written and directed with good pacing, an interesting story, and good characters. First let me start with the special effects which are really great and well used in the film. The murder scenes are important in these kind of slasher films and in this film the murder scenes are imaginative and disturbing but not particularly scary in comparison to the other ones, which might be a let down for some. All the characters in this film come off as 3 dimensional and interesting not just would be victims for Freddy. Rachel does a great job at creating good dream sequences. Robert Englund is once again excellent as Freddy. But the best part is the story for this one, where I think Rachel came up with a lot great stuff, although some of it was confusing. SPOILER ALERT... this film is not a direct sequel to the last one where Freddy was taken prisoner by his mother. The film starts where in a 10 year period Freddy tragically killed all the children in the town of spring wood, driving all the adults crazy. While this is sad it works for setting the stage for a bigger battle with Freddy. However, Freddy is trapped in the town and keeps one kid alive to help him break out. We meet a child psychiatrist named Maggie played by Liza Zane who lives in the next town. Zane comes off as a little stiff at times but overall does a good job. Yaphet Kotto is really good as Maggie's friend and dream expert. We find out Maggie is really Katherine Kruger, Freddy's daughter from before he was burned alive and he needed her to help him escape from spring wood. He then revealed to her his true plans by saying every town has an elm street which is not only one of the greatest lines in movie history but reveals that he plans to go from town to town killing children, showing that he's no longer just a threat to elm street of spring wood but the whole world. We also find out the way Freddy can die for good, pull him out of your dream and into the real world where he's human. That's a very satisfying answer to how can you kill Freddy because that hearkens back to the first film and every other film Freddy was killed in a dream. The most interesting part are the back-story\/flashbacks of Freddy. I wish the film could of explored more on Freddy's past. We find out Freddy was married and had a daughter. Which is kinda weird because Freddy kidnapped and killed little kids but he had a kid himself. But it dosen't exactly contradict the previous films, as we just assumed he was a weird loner kidnapping kids but it's even more interesting that he had a family but had a secret life as a kid killer. But the idea of Freddy having a daughter is great in the sense that the best person to have the honor to kill Freddy is his daughter. A kid killer killed by his own kid! We find out that Freddy killed his wife after she found out about his killings and his daughter accidentally saw it and he threatened her not to tell. They implied that Kathy told the police but never really makes it clear. Freddy also had many other horrific claws he used as murder weapons which was a interesting idea. The most interesting is seeing Freddy as a child and for the first time getting an idea of why Freddy grew up to be a killer and hate children. He was taunted by both kids & adults who chanted son of a hundred maniacs when he went to school, for the first time you feel bad for Freddy. He was raised by an unloving & mean stepfather played by rock legend Alice Cooper who was perfectly cast in the role. Also as a child he had violent tendencies from killing animals to cutting himself. So to me it seems like the reason Freddy hates children is because his childhood was so screwed up, he wants to take away everybody's childhood. And it was evil demons that gave him the power to kill in people's nightmares. Th 3-D at the end was okay. Overall a very good end for Freddy.

This film gets a lot of criticism, mainly for being to comedic or not scary. There always will be a debate over people who don't like the comedic Freddy vs those who like his wise quacks. Personally the wise quacks don't bother me too much and as Mr.Englund once said the humor was always there and that's true. In the 1st film Freddy had a dark humor like tonguing Nancy over the phone. But Englund also said he and the director might'eve went overboard with the humor in this one, which I kinda agree with but the reason is because director\/writer Rachel Talalay said she felt the last film was too dark and wanted to make her film lighter. However I overall like this film because I think it's well directed, has some really interesting ideas and does a good job at ending the series. What I like most about this movie is that it does a good job at answering a lot of questions like how do you kill Freddy for good? what would Freddy do if he killed all the kids in the town? and how did he get the power to enter people dreams? I think the film does a really job at answering those questions and every Freddy fan like myself should be satisfied with what they came up with. The film is well written and directed with good pacing, an interesting story, and good characters. First let me start with the special effects which are really great and well used in the film. The murder scenes are important in these kind of slasher films and in this film the murder scenes are imaginative and disturbing but not particularly scary in comparison to the other ones, which might be a let down for some. All the characters in this film come off as 3 dimensional and interesting not just would be victims for Freddy. Rachel does a great job at creating good dream sequences. Robert Englund is once again excellent as Freddy. But the best part is the story for this one, where I think Rachel came up with a lot great stuff, although some of it was confusing. SPOILER ALERT... this film is not a direct sequel to the last one where Freddy was taken prisoner by his mother. The film starts where in a 10 year period Freddy tragically killed all the children in the town of spring wood, driving all the adults crazy. While this is sad it works for setting the stage for a bigger battle with Freddy. However, Freddy is trapped in the town and keeps one kid alive to help him break out. We meet a child psychiatrist named Maggie played by Liza Zane who lives in the next town. Zane comes off as a little stiff at times but overall does a good job. Yaphet Kotto is really good as Maggie's friend and dream expert. We find out Maggie is really Katherine Kruger, Freddy's daughter from before he was burned alive and he needed her to help him escape from spring wood. He then revealed to her his true plans by saying every town has an elm street which is not only one of the greatest lines in movie history but reveals that he plans to go from town to town killing children, showing that he's no longer just a threat to elm street of spring wood but the whole world. We also find out the way Freddy can die for good, pull him out of your dream and into the real world where he's human. That's a very satisfying answer to how can you kill Freddy because that hearkens back to the first film and every other film Freddy was killed in a dream.

Released in 1970, and directed by Ted Post and written by Paul Dehn, Beneath the Planet of the Apes stars James Franciscus, Kim Hunter, Linda Harrison, and Charlton Heston.This is one of those sequels that doesn't really require the viewer to see the first film to understand what's going on. (But I think it helps.) At the beginning of the film, it shows scenes from the first film to catch viewers up. The story however is a new adventure.After the disappearance of four astronauts sent to explore space, the American National Space Administration sends two new astronauts out to find and rescue them. Sadly, these astronauts have the same fate that the previous ones did. Their space ship crashes and lands on a strange planet. The skipper of the ship (Tod Andrews) quickly dies upon landing after he sustains a serious injury during the crash.The hero of this film is a young astronaut named Brent. (James Franciscus) As he tries to find help after his skipper dies, he meets a strange and mute woman named Nova (Linda Harrison) on horseback. She is wearing the dog tag chain of Taylor (Charlton Heston) - One of the astronauts Brent had been sent to find and rescue. Brent discovers that Nova appears to be harmless, and he knows she is the only source of hope he has of perhaps finding Taylor.Together, they ride to a place called Ape City, where Brent learns that this planet is ruled by highly intelligent, humanoid Apes who know how to talk, and that this simian civilization is very hostile towards human beings. Brent and Nova attempt to escape from the Apes, but soon, they jump from the frying pan into the fire....I love Charlton Heston, and it would have been great if he had a bigger role in this film, but what we did receive in return was the perfect compensation - The character Brent is very likable, and he was played brilliantly by James Franciscus. By having a new character, it brought a fresh new presence to the story. We were also still able to enjoy Taylor because even after disappearing, his presence was still there in a sense because we the audience knew he was somewhere, and when he did finally become visible again, he was all the more appreciated.The way the filmmakers set that up was perfect. If Taylor hadn't been in the film, I think it would have weakened the film some because the audience would have wondered what became of him, and if he would have been killed at the start, I feel it would have been too depressing and again, it may have even weakened the story because we would have missed Taylor. By keeping him alive, and making us wonder what became of him, and just knowing he'd be back, and then filling in that time by introducing us to a new character, and giving us time to get to know Brent was a good move.Beneath the Planet of the Apes is a great sequel and I am glad it was made. I would have always wondered what had become of Taylor and the other characters. I also like how bizarrely science fiction this one got. It's remarkable how well this turned out, considering that1. Charlton Heston came back to play the part of Taylor reluctantly.2. The character Cornelius isn't played by actor Roddy McDowall who played the part in the first movie. An actor named David Watson played the character in this film, and he did a good job. I didn't even know until later that it wasn't the same actor from the first movie playing the part.3. The studio insisted on a reduced budget while making this film.These handicaps forced the makers of the film to be even more inventive.Other Ape sequels followed this film, and in my humble opinion, Beneath is the most legitimate of the sequels because it is the only one set on the same Planet of the Apes as the original film.I saw part II as an anti-Vietnam war film in a way because there were plenty of Americans in 1970 who did not support the war, and felt both the Viet Cong and the United States Government were tyrants fighting for power and control, and in Beneath, I saw the Gorillas and the enemies they later faced representing both the Viet Cong, and the U.S. Government.I also saw part II slightly as a Western film that touched on the subject of Native Americans - Since the Gorillas were going out to a desert to face an enemy they knew nothing about just like U.S. troops once went out into the deserts of the U.S.A. to battle Native American tribes. (U.S. troops one-hundred years later also went to Vietnam to face an unknown enemy.)Furthermore, when the Gorilla character General Urus said the line The only good human is a dead human! - This was borrowed from General Philip Sheridan of the United States Army who once said after Comanche Chief Tosawi reputedly told General Sheridan in 1869, Me Tosawi. Me good Indian, to which General Sheridan supposedly replied, The only good Indians I ever saw were dead. This was then misquoted as The only good Indian is a dead Indian.Also in the Beneath film - There were the chimps protesting the war the Gorillas were about to embark on, much like the hippies protested Vietnam in real life.I feel the sequel follows the original very well, is the ideal continuation, helped develop the story, and is a very entertaining film.

Well, it IS an American war movie, so expect patriotism. As I go through the list of reviews for this movie, almost ALL of the reviews from people who say they're from the US, boast about how great they think the movie is. On the other hand, people from other countries (mainly European) boast that it's too American. For example, the movie starts with the waving American flag and ends with it.

The film is not just a sequel to the 1979 film by Ridley Scott but also a reflective story as well. Think about it. Cameron stated that the Vietnam War was an influence on Aliens not just with the presence of soldiers but also with Ripley agreeing to go back to the world where her crew (who died one by one) visited and discovered a place of many alien eggs. Ripley's role as an observer parallels the acts of some real life Vietnam War veterans who, despite their nightmarish experiences during the war, returned to Vietnam in a totally different manner.As for why Aliens stands out nicely among other action films of the 1980s...it is SUBVERSIVE of the cinematic trends of the decade.Think about it. In Aliens, there were these highly trained and brave soldiers who easily symbolized the Gung-Ho militarism culture of 1980s action cinema. Like Rambo, these soldiers were macho and had deadly firepower with them. Yet in the film, you see that they were helpless when they encountered the aliens. Behind it all, Cameron inserted a strong mother-and-daughter relationship between Ripley and the young girl Newt. While she was lost in space, Ripley lost her daughter to old age. Newt lost her parents to aliens. Of course, none of Ripley's scenes would have happened without the incredible dramatic performances from Sigourney Weaver who truly deserved her Oscar nomination in this film. From a survivor to a mother and a fighter, Sigourney Weaver is excellent.Finally, the film's aliens (xenomorphs) are very well done even though a different creative team worked on it. It's great to see how James Cameron and his team came up with clever ways to present the aliens as numerous despite their limited resources.

But then again there's an explanation As one of the first ever real gay-themed movies, it was praised just for the very fact it talked about the Pakistani community and had a gay aspect. Two things that just weren't done before. But does it make it a good movie? No. It's long, boring, difficult to understand because it jumps from scene to scene without ever really settling on anything, and there are two many characters introduced at the same time (most with mind-numbingly boring story lines), too many things that are implied but never really said out loud. It could be subtle but it just ends up being confusing. In the end, it's a movie that wants to be about being gay, but also about being Pakistani in London, but also about being a white thug \/ homeless young guy in 80s London, but also about being a young closeted guy, and also about a guy turning an old business into a new shiny one, while also being about drug dealers, and about standing up to your community for love (a la Romeo and Juliette). In short, the film never knows what it wants to be about, and all is lost.

No. It's long, boring, difficult to understand because it jumps from scene to scene without ever really settling on anything, and there are two many characters introduced at the same time (most with mind-numbingly boring story lines), too many things that are implied but never really said out loud.

We don't need no stinkin' badges. Just as telling is the way Alfonso articulated the key concept of The Big Country when he says of Jim McKay A man like him is very rare. There is a sense of respect in Alfonso's delivery and a need to relate to others what he has seen in McKay. There is great irony in the fact that everyone else except for Julie as played by Jean Simmons fails to see McKay's qualities. And they assume superiority in all things related to life in the west. This is a film about prejudice on a number of levels. The Mexican ranch hand, Ramon, is disregarded and even called an idiot by the ranch's owner, Henry Terrill, when he tells him and daughter, Pat, not to worry about McKay going off on his own to explore the ranch. I don't think he'll get lost. He's a very smart man. And he's got a funny watch. Ramon didn't know that the watch was a compass but he knew McKay well enough to be confident that McKay's confidence in the funny watch would not be misplaced - even in country that looks all the same. The Hannassey boys mistook McKay's forbearance for cowardice. This was to be expected of them because they were young and foolish so McKay is understanding of it. However, when the woman who has declared her love for him construes his forbearance as cowardice, it is another matter. Julie asks Pat, How many times does a man have to win you? Exactly! McKay does not need to live out a lifetime of proving himself to others and a man like that is very rare. For most of us, we live lives in which what we own or what we do just have to be acknowledged over and over. Worse still, we often forget that people like Ramon are not idiots simply because they are uneducated ranch hands or express views that don't coincide with our own. The messages so skilfully hidden within a film about a grudge match between two old tyrants in the wild west are a testament to the screenwriter's craft.

At the time, Disney was not just the *best* animation studio, it was the *only* one. Even then, Fantasia is the most ambitious Disney project from that era - rather than just translate old Mother Goose and Grimm works, the limitless imaginations of the Disney animators were going to translate famous pieces of music.So what this boils down to is a head-on of two art forms the movie and the music. And who wins? The movie, by far. It's far more entertaining to watch Fantasia than to actually go to the symphony.Why? Well, it's simple 'Fantasia' is a trip to the symphony, but when you go on the trip, you borrow the mind of a true music fan with boundless, colorful imagination. This is way better than anything your head could cook up for these songs.That's not the only reason, either The songs are performed perfectly, and the announcer\/composer is the perfect guide through this strange and fantastical world. And the animation is arguably the best of any movie. Literally, any frame from this movie is worthy of being hung up in an art museum.
