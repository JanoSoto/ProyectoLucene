[{"date":"4 February 2010","score":"12 out of 21 people found the following review useful","review":" Patch Adams is based around the true life story of Hunter Adams, a very interesting man, who, after becoming suicidal and committing himself to a mental hospital, found a new lease of life and wanted to help people. Enrolling at medical school to become a doctor, Hunter became a flag waver for the laughter is the best form of medicine train of thought. Something that simultaneously irked his superiors and garnered a lot of patient support. A fascinating tale is given the Hollywood treatment with Robin Williams slotting into the role of Hunter Adams.Not only is Patch Adams a fascinating story in itself, the reaction to it, pro & con, is also of high interest. I first ventured into this film a couple of years ago, believing it to be the devil's spawn. That belief was born out of the disdain brought down on it from the revered critics of the time. It's also suffered kicks a plenty from many a film fan during the advent of internet movie sites and the snowball effect that comes with such communities. I revisited the film just this last week to see if my initial positive reaction to the film still held. It did. What I found out was something I never knew the first time that I watched the film, namely it was well regarded enough to be nominated for awards. And not some by the bye magazine awards either. Williams was nominated for best actor at the American Comedy Awards and the Golden Globes, while the film itself was nominated at The Globes in the best picture category. It should also be noted that the film was a success at the box office. Made for $90 million, it's Worldwide gross in theatres was $203 million, and it was the number one box office film in America at Christmas 1998.Why do I tell you these facts? I do so because sometimes the reputation of a film is distorted, such is the case with Patch Adams. Look, It's not a masterpiece or anything, it's an odd mixture of humour and drama and for Williams haters it's a definite no no. But it still has something for the discerning viewer. It's a film that is loaded in the protagonists favour, I mean who in their right mind could not side with the guy who makes the kiddies on the cancer ward laugh and cheer? Exactly. Things are further loaded by the portrayal of Dean Walcott by Bob Gunton, it's all snarling pomposity of the highest order, the suit you just love to hate. Then coming in from the side is Philip Seymour Hoffman as jealous swot room-mate, Mitch. Make no bones about it, the makers here are telling Hunter Adams' story; thus the other side of the fence is barely given any credence or intelligent debate. That's an itch that will not go away, but it barely stops Patch Adams being an emotionally driven, and potent, viewing experience.If you have not seen it then you now have the facts to hand, it wasn't a bomb, the kind of lead balloon release that some would have you believe it was. It's divisive for sure, and, yes, it has problems that us fans are fully aware of. But maybe you will become a fan too? Williams is on full tilt animation mode, able to make one laugh and make one cry all in the confines of one little movie. And the ending, coming after the roller-coaster has done its run on the emotional track, is itself a form of medicine that you just can't get from the chemist. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 February 2010","score":"12 out of 21 people found the following review useful","review":" Patch Adams is based around the true life story of Hunter Adams, a very interesting man, who, after becoming suicidal and committing himself to a mental hospital, found a new lease of life and wanted to help people.

This film is one of his early films that propelled Bergman's recognition by his peers as one of the greatest and influential film directors of all time. It's a psychological drama about a Swedish physician (Dr. Isak Borg), later a professor, coming to terms with his life in his elder years his mistakes, weaknesses, his successes, his strengths.Knowing Bergman's life in the family in which he grew up helps one better understand both this film as well as his others. Bergman's mother was a fairly strong-willed nurse while his father was also strong-willed and a very strict Lutheran pastor who later was appointed pastor to the King of Sweden. Bergman's father was punitive with his son, e.g., putting him in a dark closet for hours as a young child as a reaction to any wrong he considered his son had done. Young Ingmar was entranced by the stained glass in his father's churches -- their saints, angels, devils, scenes from Biblical stories. Ingmar's father and mother did NOT have a comfortable, happy marriage. One sees echoes of these experiences in the issues, the traits and behaviors of the characters Bergman gives us as both a scriptwriter and film director.Bergman described how the germ of this WS's narrative came to him while he was driving across Sweden and passing through the town in which he grew up. He imagined going to homes in which he'd once lived--opening the door and observing life and his relatives as they had been and then, after a bit--exiting through the door back to life in the present. So this device (plus some troubling dreams) is used to help jolt his main character, Dr. Borg, into reassessing his attitudes and behavior.My explorations of my own family plus my work as a family therapist helped me appreciate this movie very much. One sees ample instances of how some of these traits are transmitted and cascade through the generations. The tone at the end of the film is largely satisfying to most. Our group unanimously thought WS ranked among the very best of the best films we've seen this season.Victor Sjöström, a renowned Swedish film director and former actor who played Dr. Borg, was in somewhat precarious health throughout the filming and died not long after completing this film.FWIW, the title Wild Strawberries refers to a scene in the movie in which a young woman goes to a patch of little known wild strawberries to pick some as a succulent gift for a relative.
