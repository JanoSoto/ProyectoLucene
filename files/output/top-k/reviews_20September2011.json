It's not that I have started only now watching them, mind you. I've seeing quite a lot during the last year, even if I've only reviewed a few, and&#x97;-my, oh my--there should be somewhere a textile plant working 24\/7 just to weave enough fabric to cover the naked butts of so many emperors out there. Now to my review The first flaw I see in LGI is the acting, the mood it is too casual. See, these men come from war--from the worst form of war, trench war, which horrified even Hitler to the point of making him force his generals to develop a new form of it (Blitzkrieg). Yet they look sharp, mentally well, even with a gift for comedy, vaudeville, when their true life counterparts where mental & psychological wrecks after 18 months of carnage. I can believe that in TGE, where the POWs were airmen; or in Stalag 17 where they had seen little action before falling prisoners, but not in a WWI German POW camp. If you've seen films that accurately portrait the horrors of WWI--All Quiet in the Western Front, Paths of Glory--you'll agree that these men can't have come from the same place. It is only in the last half hour that LGI gives us a taste of what that war was really about, after the death of Boeldieu and the escape of Marechal & Rosenthal.Then there is the plot. It's not solidly built; it lacks deep. It meanders from subplot to subplot without being quite sure where it wants to go. The tunnel? Gone, forgotten. The vaudevillian which seemed destined to greater things? The same. And what about the Pindar reading guy, why is he just left behind? And what's the point of the Russian subplot? (In Stalag 17 there is also a Russian subplot, but to show that Sefton could get even women in that camp). LGI seems to find its calling only in its last 30 min., when Boeldieu dies and the escapees find the farm. Marechal troubled relationship with Else is the closest thing to a strong, deep, story line you'll find here, specially when his departure makes even sharper her loneliness and hardship, the same millions of women must have endured during that and any other war. But that's almost ruined by an unbelievable ending. An imaginary line on the snow makes the German guards let them go, instead of shooting them. As for the Rauffenstein--Boldieu relationship, I found the first just too eager to express his empathy for Boldieu and his reasons-&#x97;their common upbringing--a bit shaky. Their final scene evokes more a farewell of two lovers than anything else, which is emphasized even more by his symbolic cutting of his lone geranium.The direction is tight, but the editing from Hell. Many times, when something crucial happens, there is a sudden jump to a new scene without us having the chance of experiencing the resulting change of mood. For ex., when they are ready to escape and are told they'll be transferred to another camp, the action moves quickly to the transfer itself, without giving us the occasion of seeing them work out their disappointment. Then, after what it seems a trip with so many stops we see Rauffenstein reading that Marechal & Boldieu have attempted several escapes, which can only mean they were sent to other camps during that time, but no info at all is given to us about that. Or we see Marechal interrupting the drag show and right after that he's in solitary. We have no idea either of the passing of the (story) time--except when Marechal tells Boldieu they have been pals for 18 months&#x97;neither of the dates when this happens, except for some news bulletin which is dated 20 of Feb. 1916.Despite all that, not a bad movie, it has some interesting bits--like a flute playing Boldieu asking for some hot lead and the whole Elsa, Lotte episode--and there is good use of the settings, especially in the night scenes, with expert use of lightning and camera angles and movement. A quite decent movie but not a great one by any means. I suspect it's so highly regarded only because of conscience pangs, as everybody has ripped off something from it. 6.0\/10.BTW' I don't agree with all that humanity of men in war and we are all equals crap critics talk so much about.
