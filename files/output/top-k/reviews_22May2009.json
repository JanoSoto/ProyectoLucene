This modern western focuses on the life of ruthless young man Hud Bannon (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Paul Newman), who seems to only care about drinking and women, causing conflict between him and his stern father Homer Bannon (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Melvyn Douglas). Hud's nephew Lon 'Lonnie' Bannon (Brandon De Wilde) admires his Uncle's cheating ways, but he becomes aware of his reckless amorality to bear him anymore. The only other person who seems to talk to Hud is the housekeeper Alma Brown (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Patricia Neal), who he and Lonnie find attractive. The big story of the film that brings Hud, Homer and Lonnie together is the cattle developing foot-and-mouth disease, and of course they have to kill them to stop a spread. In the end, after Homer has died, Lonnie finally decides to leave the ranch and get away from Hud, asking him to put his inheritance in the bank, and Hud dismisses his departure just smiling and taking a swig of alcohol. Also starring John Ashley as Hermy, Whit Bissell as Mr. Burris, Crahan Denton as Jesse and Val Avery as Jose. Newman does do well in his role, but he was beaten to the Oscar by Sidney Poitier in Lilies of the Field, the first winning African American leading actor, and Douglas and Neal as the Oscar winners also do very well. I admit it took me a little while to get into it, but it turned out to be a good drama. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Director for Martin Ritt and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Motion Picture Director.

It almost seems to be a formula a revolutionary idea is used, people hate it, people try to destroy it, they nearly succeed, and then decades later, after the creator's death, the public finally catches up with the sophisticated masterpieces before their time. And that, for a long time, was the case of Fritz Lang's revolutionary, enthralling silent masterpiece Metropolis. It may have been despised and panned upon its original release and almost forgotten, but now time has caught up with Lang's visions and Metropolis is recognized as the influential milestone it is. Even if, up until now, it was never fully recovered and appreciated the way Lang intended it to be.Metropolis, based on a novel by Thea von Harbou (who also wrote the screenplay), is a story that may seem hackneyed and commonplace for futuristic tales today, but in its day, it was one of the most original. The film revolves around an unnamed dystopia in futuristic (even today) Germany, where the upper class lives in prosperity and the lower class suffers and perishes in a crude excuse for a civilization below the surface of the earth. While the mastermind of the city (Alfred Abel) plans to destroy the hope of his subterranean workers, his son (Gustav Frohlich) secretly works against his father to bring hope and happiness to them. And the center of this battle, the figure the whole film revolves around, is a beautiful young woman named Maria (Brigitte Helm).Even if one does not particularly like (or even hates) Metropolis, there is no denying that is one of the most influential movies of all time. Many science-fiction elements that seem almost formula today began with this. The idea of a disguising a robot as a human being, for example, originated from this film. The futuristic dystopia, cars traveling on elevated bridges at skyscraper-level, cyborgs, a mad scientist who stares hysterically as he throws the switch. These all came from Metropolis or at least were brought to public notice by it.But Metropolis is of course, loved not because it is influential, but because it is a very powerful story. Even for the era of the silent films, it is an original sci-fi tale, a creative visionary masterpiece, a romantic love story, a poignant drama, and a fairly interesting look at the corruptibility of humankind. Metropolis very well may have been an influence for Aldous Huxley's classic novel A Brave New World among other classic stories about the future and the progress of man.Unfortunately, as anyone can tell by looking at the film in its present state, it has not been treated well. Metropolis has not been seen in its original form since its first release in Germany in 1927. Because of the negative reviews, footage was cut. And after reissue upon reissue, over an hour's worth of running time was lost and many scenes that explained the plot were lost, thus increasing the negative response toward the film. And now, even with a properly and beautifully restoration of the movie (the best restoration I've probably ever seen) the movie is incomplete, because more than twenty-five percent of the film has been lost for decades. Missing segments of the film are outlined via subtitles and even if one has become completely absorbed with Lang's masterpiece, there is still that feeling of lacking. Of incompletion. Had Metropolis been as popular back then as it was today, not a single frame would have been lost.But now, unlike say the fate of other nearly-lost films, there is hope. I am very happy to inform all readers of my review that in mid-2008, film archivists in Argentina discovered what appears to be the three-hour-long director's cut of Metropolis the way Fritz Lang intended it to be seen and really, the only way it should be seen. Why hasn't this footage been released as of now (May 2009)? Because, remember, the footage is EIGHTY years old and in terrible condition. It will take some time to restore the thousands of dirty, scratched up frames but when it is finally put back together with the already replenished footage, you can bet there will be a DVD release and maybe a special screening for the fans and movie buffs.So as of now, only those archivists, some journalists who saw the film, and the people to restore the lost footage, are the only men alive who really appreciate (to the full) the power of Fritz Lang's film. To the rest of us, even the two-hour-long cut is marvelous and enthralling, but we (including I) still don't quite know what we're talking about when we discuss Metropolis. It takes sheer power for even an incomplete puzzle to revolutionize and revision the world. One can only imagine how the original must have been. Thankfully, the movie has been found in its entirety and will soon be rescued from the ravages of time and thirty-three years after the director's death, his masterpiece will be reviewed anew.

It isn't camp at all--to me, camp, and kitsch, are more willed than conditioned--and between McCormack's insouciant brilliance (she's ten during filming) and Kelly's hemorrhaging doubt, it's too much to take. You want to cry out and interfere. The one character who is not clueless, the mother's father, is so lifeless he contributes only some facts to his slowly suspecting daughter. And the one character who might help, the funny and unflappable and ever wise aunt living upstairs (played with perfection by Evelyn Varden) is clueless. Another two or three of the cast make caricature appearances that are part of the farce, but most remarkable must be the hired help, character actor Henry Jones. What did he tell the littler girl? You're so cool you couldn't melt butter.Did I say that Kelly is a complete wonder yet? Well, Patty McCormack will blow you away, too, even a second time around. And these two actresses are the movie.Don't forget, this killer gene didn't actually skip a generation, did it?

It's not even my favorite genre. But recently I've been catching up with a lot of classics my father likes so much. I had seen THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI before as a little kid, and now revisited it through a bit more experienced eyes. A lot of great reviews are written here on these pages, and maybe this film really comes close to being 10\/10 material. But since I haven't really watched that much old war classics, I'm not going to attempt to write an in-depth review and just provide some random impressions in this user-comment instead.How many times have you seen deleted scenes on a DVD where the director explains it was cut out for pacing issues, really? Well, I'm convinced half of the time they're actually trying to say the producers were afraid audiences might find our movie boring if we left too much in it. A lot of these deleted scenes cut out to improve the pacing could have easily been left in the film. But last week, I felt quite differently while watching THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. The first hour of the movie actually felt too long (mind you, not too slow, but more like certain scenes went on too long and the plot didn't really progress like it should have). We're talking a movie here that runs about 160 minutes and I'm 100% sure if this film would have been made today, they would have cut out more than half an hour of footage from that first half. And not only because films have changed so much over the years and everything has to go fast. At first, the stretched out first half of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. felt like a flaw, but the movie's second half made me reconsider this. The plot shifts focus, and concentrates on an escaped Prisoner Of War, who fled from the camp and becomes part of a team sent back in to go and blow up the bridge. Suddenly, during the part of his recovery at a military hospital, the screenplay injects quite a bit of humor (the conversation between Warden and his superior officers about him not receiving parachute-training was a wonderful highlight) and from then on, when their mission starts, the film gets much more exciting. It made me appreciate the first hour more for the establishing reasons it was used for, and also because - to my surprise - the shifting in tone and pace worked wonders. There's so much you could go into if you're looking to praise this film. Needless to mention what a fine performance Alec Guinness and other cast members gave, so I'll just point out how impressed I was when I saw the movie's climax. They way the script builds up to it, is one thing. Taking the time to lay out a strategy and incorporating the notion that this whole mission might even go terribly wrong at one point, successfully increases tension during those final scenes. But the fact that the filmmakers completely destroyed a real bridge and a real train...? No use of miniatures or other special effects. Now which movies made today would actually have the courage to show us something like that? Simply none. Those days are over.The only thing I would have preferred, is having seen the first half of the film injected with a slightly more grim mood, because frankly, that cheerful (and very famous) whistle-tune of the prisoners and some of the fanfare-esquire parts of the musical score got on my nerves a bit. I'll just blame that on the fact that this foremost still is a Hollywood movie. And that's just the way anyone will have to take this film, regardless it was based on (and altered) real facts of war. From a historical point of view, the film might be insufficiently accurate, but it really feels like one of the greatest and most entertaining war-movies ever made.
