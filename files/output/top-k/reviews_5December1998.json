I just don't see why anyone except Anthony Perkins deserved recognition in the original. The acting was pretty bland and the end scene involving the analysis of Norman was excessively long.  In Gus Van Sant's version, the shower scene is quicker, Norman Bates gets to perform an act he should have performed in the first film while watching Anne Heche's character through the wall, the analysis is more interesting and the acting is wonderful.  The fact that the movie is the same, but has more graphic elements (such as showing the stab wounds in Anne Heche's back and the slashes on William H Macy's face) made it still interesting to me.  I wasn't expecting to see the graphic elements, so I was very much interested in the movie.The only part I take issue with is the fact that Van Sant kept some elements the same that should have been changed.  For instance, Anne's wardrobe is the same...it looks weird with her modern haircut.  Plus,  Julianne Moore is modern...why the difference in the characters?

If you're looking for morality, ethics, or plot, you won't find them here, but if you're looking for a really short film with some excellent acting and cameo shots, this one's worth checking out. Not everyone who watches the movie will enjoy it, but almost everyone will get a few laughs out of it.A warning about this movie to some, though, might be the basic premise. Four guys who center their lives around smoking weed. Everything that happens in this movie happens because the characters have severe drug problems. But it's the character-driven obsession with the weed that gives the movie it's flavor. Even if you're one of those people who doesn't approve of marijuana, you'll get a kick out of the flick because it does show that smoking weed is a bad thing to do, and will end up getting you in trouble. In typical movie fashion, all the characters end up alright in the end, but there are a few scary scenes, particularly the hilarious shower scene that takes place while one of the characters is in prison (he killed a diabetic horse while stoned).I usually don't enjoy stoner movies (and often don't finish them), but this one was worth watching. (It did help that the movie was really short -- if they had tried making it longer, they would have lost the comedic element.) The cast of the movie does an excellent job in their roles, and there are some fabulous cameo appearances -- the two most notable were probably Canadian actor Tommy Chong (well-known to many fans of stoner flick from the Cheech & Chong series) and well-known comedian Bob Saget as a very out-spoken member of a narcotics anonymous group. Other celebrities you can see here include Janeane Garofalo, Stephen Baldwin, Willie Nelson, and comedian Steven Wright, as well as Canadian dramatic and comic actor Jason Blicker.Viewers who enjoy the movie for the stoner aspects may also enjoy The Stoned Age (not as funny or as well-written, but along the same lines) or the cult hit Pulp Fiction. If it's the comedy that gets you, it might be worth checking out the Hot Shots series, or various National Lampoon movies (particularly Loaded Weapon 1 and Senior Trip).

Sure, we've seen tons of films based on the concept of money being the root of all evil, and of course we know that greed, unlike what Gordon Gekko might think, is not good. However director Sam Raimi and writer Scott B. Smith bring the concept to such a shatteringly human level that A Simple Plan hits a lot closer to home than some would like it to. When three friends find $4.4 million in cash, they decide to keep it, with reservations. Soon enough there are complications from such a decision as questions of trust, honesty and loyalty begin to tear them apart. The men are played by Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Brent Briscoe. While Paxton doesn't want to keep the money at first, Thornton, playing his brother, and someone of slightly diminished mental capacity, and the brash and temperamental Briscoe, talk him into it. Bridget Fonda plays Paxton's wife, and she almost steals the film as she becomes more and more involved in the plotting of their scheme. While most films dealing with found money are interested mainly in greed and its consequences, A Simple Plan gives us regular people with average dreams who are given an opportunity to fulfill them. Thornton wants to fix up his dad's old farm, and maybe buy a good truck. Fonda, pregnant, wants to be able to care for her child without needing food stamps. What A Simple Plan does by giving us characters and situations that could stem from real life and not some kind of movie fantasy is it puts us on their level, and in a way, implicates us along with them. When a character has to make  a decision that may very well affect the rest of their lives, we wonder if we'd make the same decision or not. While a film like Very Bad Things covered somewhat similar circumstances, it was more concerned with being a hip, shockorama type film, it didn't pause to consider consequences or guilt. When Paxton makes a particularly grisly decision, he immediately asks his wife if she could have been capable of making the same decision. Billy Bob Thornton, in a sad, brilliant performance is the moral center of the film, his feelings of guilt resonate throughout the entire film. While the concept may be  a well worn one, A Simple Plan brings an emotional weight to it that most other films haven't accomplished. Under Sam Raimi's direction there are plenty of chills, and a few macabre moments,and the snowy landscape is as effective as it was in Fargo, but it also understands a lot about human nature. If only we could do something like the characters in A Simple Plan and not think about it afterwards. You see it's the thinking part that gets them in trouble.

There are other indications of this being a later time and day -- e.g. later model cars with electric car windows.  Other than this however, Gus Van Sant has tried faithfully to make us believe that we are in the middle of the 1960s.  The duality of this has an interesting although not totally successful effect on the viewer.  But that's okay.  As far as remakes go, this one fulfills the meaning of the word better than any other remake I've seen.  And like I say, I think it is a bold, and courageous effort for a director in Hollywood these days -- how do you make it play like 1960 in 1998.  How do you make it just as scary in this day and age of Scream and Scream 2?  Gus Van Sant succeeds by showing us that it didn't need updating -- it needed remembering.  The shower scene is just as scary, probably more so, due to the reality of technicolor, and so are select other scenes -- all done as they were originally done by the master himself.

It appealed directly to my own sightly sick sense of humor. The writing style was realistic and flowed well-the movie's pace was never too slow. Christian Slater should play the psychotic roles more often-he carries them off exceptionally well. The rest of the cast, with the exception of Cameron Diaz, also put in good performances.

He's not a bad actor, but he's definitely NOT Norman Bates!  The cast of actors and actresses were superb, but they were absolutely terrible in this film.  Not for lack of trying, though.I can't imagine what Gus Van Sant was thinking when he made this remake.  It wasn't necessarily a bad idea, but his execution of it was all wrong!  His attempts to modernize it were shameful and crude.  Did Hitchcock ever film Norman masturbating at the peephole?  Did Hitchcock ever show us Lila Crane going to get her Walkman?!  Plus, the shower scene and Arbogast's death were two of the most suspenseful scenes in the original, but what was with those intercut images in this remake?!  They were pointless and fatal to the shock that the scenes were meant to have.What really disgusts me is how many times I've heard the director and cast proclaim how Hitchcock himself would've be flattered at their endeavor.  No, I think he'd be the first one to get out of his seat and demand a refund! Hitchcock would have been disgusted by this defamation of Psycho.In short, the only chilling thing in this film that was also true to the original was Bernard Herrmann's unnerving score.  At least Danny Elfman deserves credit for preserving the music.And one last thing---Psycho in color?  Not such a good idea.
