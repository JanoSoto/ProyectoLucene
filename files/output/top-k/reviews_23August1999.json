Silence of the Lambs lacks special effects and except for a scene or two, doesn't have jump out at you scares yet is widely considered one of the scariest movies ever.  Why?  Because the audience is given just enough info to truly be frightened by the possibilities and the knowledge that something real is behind it all.  Blair Witch gives some hints of things to be frightened of, but nothing to indicate that something truly malevolent is taking place. As for the second.  My imagination is fine.  I'm a filmmaker myself.  When I go to a film I go to become involved in the filmmaker's imagination.

Jaws left alot to the imagination but it also gave me enough to go on to fuel my imagination.  Blair Witch gave me nothing.  Not a hint, not a glimpse.

I am left thinking that the filmmakers had nothing scary in mind... that it was their imagination that was lacking, not mine.

I can enjoy a non-effect movie as long as there is something compelling going on.  Blair Witch was interesting but hardly compelling, and effects or not, there was *nothing* scary.  Not a single solitary moment of the film caused me to jump in my seat, to look over my shoulder or to instill a fear in me that wasn't already there.  Silence of the Lambs lacks special effects and except for a scene or two, doesn't have jump out at you scares yet is widely considered one of the scariest movies ever.  Why?  Because the audience is given just enough info to truly be frightened by the possibilities and the knowledge that something real is behind it all.  Blair Witch gives some hints of things to be frightened of, but nothing to indicate that something truly malevolent is taking place. As for the second.  My imagination is fine.  I'm a filmmaker myself.  When I go to a film I go to become involved in the filmmaker's imagination.  If the whole point of the film was simply to be scared by what I can imagine, why go to the movie?  I can sit at home and imagine some pretty scary stuff without spending $4.50.  Jaws left alot to the imagination but it also gave me enough to go on to fuel my imagination.  Blair Witch gave me nothing.  Not a hint, not a glimpse.  For all I know, the whole thing was a practical joke played on them by Mike, the movie not only doesn't offer any explanations it doesn't even offer any clues (and yes I know what the ending was supposed to be and that was hardly enough to validate any explanation from aliens to a ticked-off hermit).  I am left thinking that the filmmakers had nothing scary in mind... that it was their imagination that was lacking, not mine.  That they couldn't think of something sufficiently scary to match the build up so instead of going for the big climax, they just end it and then say imagine something scary here  That's not filmmaking genius, that's a cop-out.  If Speilburg had *never* showed us the shark and instead left the possibility open that it wasn't a shark but perhaps a big p-o'd goldfish or maybe just a maniacal scuba diver or maybe (insert something you think is scary here) people would have been upset too.  Movie scares require something concrete to scare me.  There was nothing concrete in Blair Witch.  The sticks & rocks set up a creepy atmosphere but are not scary by themselves. I have no problem with a movie that doesn't draw a straight line for me, that doesn't make all the connections explicit (Eyes Wide Shut for instance which requires active thought on the part of viewer and was thus not understood by most people) but if I'm to be left to connect the dots myself, you'd better at least give me the dots.If this film scared you, fine.  But for me it didn't and the film's supporters attempts to explain why it didn't scare me (usually in an insulting manner) simply don't hold water.

I have lived in Canada all my life in what would be considered somewhere in between a city like New York and a town like West Canaan.

That they want to see their kids do something that they never could?  Besides Kilmer being an idiot and a control freak in the film, I thought Varsity Blues' central issue was to show how obsessed we all are when it comes to sports and our kids achieving greatness, at any level.Varsity Blues is a great film.  And what I enjoyed most about it was the acting and the football scenes.  James VDB shows that he is capable of playing someone other than Dawson Leery.  And his range in here is perfect.  It also has to be mentioned that if this film was taken more seriously than it was, then I really think that John Voigt would be up for an Oscar nomination for his role as the control freak Bud Kilmer.  He is the embodiment of an American football coach that seems to care only about his reputation and not his player's welfare.  His southern, red neck twang, his pretencious gum chewing, his snarl when he barks orders and his domination of the entire town just by a simple comment made in a local diner shows how versatile and understanding of an actor that Voigt is.  Coincidentally, I had just rented Anaconda two days before I saw this on Viewers Choice, and I was truly amazed at the range by Voigt.  He really is terrific in this film. I also have to mention Ron Lester who plays Billy Bob, the guargantuanly over weight line backer with a heart of gold.  At first when we meet him he is a caricature of every other over weight star athlete.  He eats fatty foods like they were going out of style, he is the life of the party as he pukes and then comes back for more and he is one of the guys.  But later in the film we see his character grow.  There is more to his character than we initially see, and when he is given an opportunity to act, he is perfect as we see how he feels and how hurt he is.  This really should be a breakout role for him.  Varsity Blues has some of the best football action I've ever seen filmed.  The plays are realistic looking, the hits are violent and the symmetry of the completed plays are awesome to watch.  This is a film that makes you feel like you are really watching a high school football game.There is really nothing wrong with Varsity Blues and if you enjoy highschool themes like relationships and humour then you will probably love this film.  And there is one more thing to love about this film, well two actually, if you are a guy that is.  Ms. Davis and Darcy Sears.  That whip cream bikini is something I'll never forget.  What a dish.

Life is lost, land is destroyed and crimes are committed.  And I think that is the real issue in this film.  If a crime is committed in the battle field, does one deserve to get punished for it?  I have never been to war and I thank God for that, but I still think my opinion is a valid one.  No one deserves to be brutalized ( I understand death on the battlefield is acceptable) or violated during war.  That means anyone from a POW to an innocent civilian. Watching this film made me look at us as human beings and ask the question that I have asked so many times.  What's wrong with us?  What is it that makes people behave the way we do towards each other or towards other living things?  It is a question that I think is impossible to get an answer for. Watching this film is hard because it takes a dark and evil subject and puts it right before our eyes.  Reading about it would be bad enough, but to see it right before our eyes on 35 mm film is raw.  And it is an experience that I will never forget.What is bad about this film is the opening ten minutes and the final five. That is when we see Erickson in the present.  It is a completely different film and these scenes have no business in the film itself.  But if you discard fifteen minutes of film, what you are left with is one of the grittiest, most realistic and frustrating films to watch.  What we see is six soldiers that are in the battle field.  They kidnap a village girl because they are angry and frustrated with the war.  She has nothing to do with it and the only crime she has committed is that she is a Vietnemese girl.  Two of the soldiers are adament about the kidnapping and only one of them is dead set against it and actually shows remorse and resistance. The leader is Meserve, played with ferociousness by Sean Penn.  I believed his portrayal so much that I really have a hard time watching him as the fun loving Spicolli in Fasttimes now.  He plays Meserve with anger, bitterness and spite.  He is angry, at what?  Who knows.  The war, the situation, the surroundings.  Probably all of that.  But his anger goes much deeper than that.  I think he is just angry for being born and he is taking it out on the world, and this one unfortunate village girl happens to be his scratching post.The rape scenes are especially hard to watch.  They are on par with any of the rape scenes in Last House On The Left, and her death is just as disturbing as the ones in LHOTL and 8mm.  Her death was meaningless and it could have been avoided.  And when she died, I felt terrible.  I felt ashamed that as a member of the human species one of my own kind could do this to another human.To make this film work you have to have good performances.  Sean Penn and Michael J. Fox are great.  As I said Penn is so realistic that he bothers me now.  Fox has a tricky role because you not only have to empathize with his character but he has to go through a wide array of emotions.  Penn is just angry, Fox is all over the map.  And he does an incredible job.  Also good in her role is the girl who played the Vietnemese girl.  DePalma let her write all her own dialogue and it is appropriate that she is not subtitled. None of her attackers would know what she is saying, so why should we? Besides, someone getting raped is a hard enough scene to watch in any launguage.It's really too bad that the first and last parts of the film weren't handled better because this could have been one of the best films ever made. I still do hold it high on my list as one of the best war films ever made though.  But I have to warn you, Saving Private Ryan is tough to watch because of its gritty realism on the battlefield.

Watching this film is hard because it takes a dark and evil subject and puts it right before our eyes.  Reading about it would be bad enough, but to see it right before our eyes on 35 mm film is raw.  And it is an experience that I will never forget.What is bad about this film is the opening ten minutes and the final five. That is when we see Erickson in the present.  It is a completely different film and these scenes have no business in the film itself.  But if you discard fifteen minutes of film, what you are left with is one of the grittiest, most realistic and frustrating films to watch.  What we see is six soldiers that are in the battle field.  They kidnap a village girl because they are angry and frustrated with the war.  She has nothing to do with it and the only crime she has committed is that she is a Vietnemese girl.  Two of the soldiers are adament about the kidnapping and only one of them is dead set against it and actually shows remorse and resistance. The leader is Meserve, played with ferociousness by Sean Penn.  I believed his portrayal so much that I really have a hard time watching him as the fun loving Spicolli in Fasttimes now.  He plays Meserve with anger, bitterness and spite.  He is angry, at what?  Who knows.  The war, the situation, the surroundings.  Probably all of that.  But his anger goes much deeper than that.  I think he is just angry for being born and he is taking it out on the world, and this one unfortunate village girl happens to be his scratching post.The rape scenes are especially hard to watch.  They are on par with any of the rape scenes in Last House On The Left, and her death is just as disturbing as the ones in LHOTL and 8mm.  Her death was meaningless and it could have been avoided.  And when she died, I felt terrible.  I felt ashamed that as a member of the human species one of my own kind could do this to another human.To make this film work you have to have good performances.  Sean Penn and Michael J. Fox are great.  As I said Penn is so realistic that he bothers me now.  Fox has a tricky role because you not only have to empathize with his character but he has to go through a wide array of emotions.  Penn is just angry, Fox is all over the map.  And he does an incredible job.  Also good in her role is the girl who played the Vietnemese girl.  DePalma let her write all her own dialogue and it is appropriate that she is not subtitled. None of her attackers would know what she is saying, so why should we? Besides, someone getting raped is a hard enough scene to watch in any launguage.It's really too bad that the first and last parts of the film weren't handled better because this could have been one of the best films ever made. I still do hold it high on my list as one of the best war films ever made though.  But I have to warn you, Saving Private Ryan is tough to watch because of its gritty realism on the battlefield.  This one is just as hard to watch because we can put a face to the person that is getting violated. This should be a film that everyone sees once.  Not so much because it is about war but because it is about how human beings are really a sick species, this film and incidents like it prove that.  And that is sad.

I just recently started a job and I mentioned to a guy at work that I really wanted to see Eraserhead but could never find it. He just happened to own a copy and I just watched it tonite. I was so nervous that I'd hate the movie but I LOVED IT!Just a warning to those of you who haven't seen this Lynch masterpiece yet. Don't watch it unless you are ready for a horrific and mind blowing experience. This movie makes you think and I feel that anyone who would dismiss this film as 'garbage' or 'dumb' doesn't care to put on their thinking caps while watching a flick. I guess some people just want to watch movies in which they don't have to think and everything is layed out for them on the screen. I pity them.First of all I want to say that the cinematography was excellent in this film and so was the acting by Jack Nance. Lynch's use of the industrial noise soundtrack I think was brilliant and made the world this film is set in much more bleak and horrific.Eraserhead is a film of symbolism and thats why I dig it so much. Henry's wife, the baby, the woman across the hall, the woman in the radiator and the things she steps on, the brick wall view, the elevator........all symbolize something. What do they symbolize? That's for each of us to decide. Lynch just didn't put these images on our screens for his own enjoyment. He wanted us to think. He wanted us to ask, what the hell am I watching? why does the baby look like that? who is the woman in the radiator? what is wrong with Henry's girlfriend and her parents? why is the film called Eraserhead? what happened in the end? Maybe David Lynch knows the answers to these questions. But his answers are his answers only. If Lynch wanted us to know what the symbolism meant to him he would have just explained it to us. He would've laid it all out on the screen. But he didn't. I think that Lynch wants all of us to come up with our own answers. Otherwise, why wouldn't he have told us his?Like Kubrick's 2001, Eraserhead will not be liked by all who see it nor has it been. I feel however that if you keep an open mind, and are ready to use your mind and decipher the nightmare-ish imagery in the film you will probably like it. Don't get me wrong though. Even if you love it you will not watch it again right away. I loved it and I don't plan on rewatching it for a while. Besides having to endure disturbing scenes all over again (the wife rubbing her eye, the final act of Henry with his baby and the after effects, the dinner at his in-laws), I don't think the human mind could handle seeing Eraserhead more than once in a day! Or even in a week! So in ending my rambling If you haven't seen Eraserhead see it! And if you have seen it and didn't like it, rewatch it with an open mind. And if you have seen it and did like it, recooperate a bit and then watch it again. I'm sure you'll pick up on some more things on the second go around.

I am usually only creeped out if I watch a movie at home alone in the dark in the middle of the night; in this case, I saw the movie with friends in a crowded theatre and it was still light out when we exited the theatre.  Admittedly, I wasn't petrified at first.  When we really got scared was when we were walking back to our hotel (as we were visiting a friend of mine) in an area that seemed to have an aversion to street lights.  It was very dark and it did not help that we were walking by bushes.  We were all totally freaked out and kept looking around behind us.  We had the last scene of the movie stuck in our heads, and it stayed there.  I am somewhat embarrassed to admit that I had to leave a light on when I went to sleep.  I haven't done that since I was 7 and saw an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, where the almost-final image of a girl hung outside on the door of her home stayed with me for days.  Any movie that can have this kind of an effect on me is pretty unusual.  Even now, when I'm thinking about the final scene of this movie, I am getting somewhat creeped out.

In the sea monster sequence, Jar Jar distracts you from the coolest sea monsters ever put on the screen.  I'll wait till this is on video to watch it again so I can at least turn off the volume.

So much happens that it's hard to keep up with it all and I'd love to see it again but I just can't stomach that Jar Jar guy's voice.  I really liked Darth Maul, as did everyone else I talked to.  Why do we get so much of Jar Jar who everyone hates and so little of Darth Maul who everyone likes?  Go figure.  Without Jar Jar, I'd have probably seen this movie several times by now so I think Lucas is hurting his films with his fanatical desire to keep the outer space equivalent to Gilligan in the series.  In the sea monster sequence, Jar Jar distracts you from the coolest sea monsters ever put on the screen.  I'll wait till this is on video to watch it again so I can at least turn off the volume.  I keep hoping Lucas will do a special edition with Jar Jar digitally painted out of the film and his voice stripped off the soundtrack.

The characters weren't great and weren't bad either.  Sure, we've seen it all before in other films but I have little hope of finding a film that's completely original.  Frankly, I got about what I expected out of it - motion picture fastfood.  You enjoy it as you take it in and digest it and forget about it after you leave the theater.  It's just entertainment and not bad for what it is.  Unlike LOST IN SPACE or BATMAN AND ROBIN, this film isn't boring.  It moves at a quick enough pace to where you don't find yourself checking your watch all the time.  I'm not sure what the deal was with Donald Sutherland's character who displays no sense of logic whatsoever.  Had they dropped the stuff with his character, it would've helped the film.  If you're bored, check it out.  It's worth at least one viewing.

DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM!!!I saw The Blair Witch Project a few days ago and I truly believe it is one of the most original and frightening movies I have ever seen. Sadly, based on the comments I have been reading on this and other websites-- the beauty of this movie will go unnoticed by many. This movie is not trying to play into the American public's expectations. It is NOT supposed to look Aaron Spelling perfect with lighting and framing and clear images. This move is supposed to be shot by 3 film students. If all of the camera shots were perfectly lighted and the camera was tripod still it would be ludicrous.... for those of you who think the film is too shaky or poorly made, keep in mind that this was done ON PURPOSE in order to make the film seem authentic.For those of you who whine because there's no guts and gore, or cat scares, or digitalized special effects-- I pity you. Assuming that horror as a genre is only scary or acceptable if it follows the pattern of Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street rejects some fabulous movies. Just as every comedy doesn't have to have the same stock elements, horror films can also deviate. This movie was amazing precisely because it DIDN'T buy into the over-played and overdone technique of using blood and guts to scare. Instead, this movie sets up a valid premise and allows this scenario to run to a (semi) logical conclusion.While everyone's entitled to their own opinion, I find it sad that many people will never accept this movie simply because it doesn't conform to their stock view of what a film should be like. There were effects before digitalized effects and there are horror movies without a single bit of on screen violence. To reject movies on face because they're different than you might expect is to miss many, many wonderful films.For those who are open to something different, this movie might really scare you. It's not SUPPOSED to be like Halloween or Prom Night or similar films... and maybe, if you're open to new ideas-- that's a GOOD THING!
