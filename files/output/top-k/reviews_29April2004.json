What this movie does, as does another Levin creation, Stepford wives, is lure you in. There maybe moments that are not scary but as it goes on and you keep watching you start to get more and more creeped out-the atmosphere is what does it-even if someone were tuning in and didn't know this story already-the creepy feeling that something's very wrong is still there strongly from the beginning, strengthening in tone as you get deeper into the picture until by the end and the final few scenes your blown away.This is definitely more subtley and atmospherically creepy then a boo in your face scare fest like scream.

What he doesn't count on is falling in love with her and the circumstances hovering their impending romance.Paltrow has never been finer and succeeds in making her character not a victim but an individual coping with the harsh reality of raising her boys by herself and coming to terms with loving again. Written and directed by Don Roos (the script is smart, witty and poignant throughout with characters that feel all too real in what easily could've been manipulatively maudlin. Laugh and cry formula works and the on-again-off-again real-life relationship between the couple underscores all the emotions on full tilt.
