The film is told from the point of view of Timmothy Dunphy, an underachiever whose main goal in life seems to be how much dope he can smoke. His mother committed suicide when he was just a small boy so it is just him, his disabled little brother and his father. One night while high on dope Tim smashes his car into a parked cop car! His old man has to bail him out of jail. In an attempt to turn his life around, old man Dunphy makes his son cut his hair and forces him to go to a strict boarding school in Connecticut. So here we have a poor kid at a rich prep- school. While here, he meets a rich, smart, preppy co-ed totally the opposite of himself but of course, they fall in love! This film has many funny as well as serious parts. During periods without dialog we hear many great rock songs from the 60's and 70's. The film was set in 1974. The 'bad guy' in the film is Mr. Funderberk (Timothy Crowe),the strict resident adviser or whatever you want to call him. Although a comedy, the film does have elements of drama. The scene with Tim talking to his old man about his mother is sad. His girlfriend Jane (Amy Smart) gets accepted to Brown but she gets accused of something she didn't do so her acceptance gets reversed as a result. Tim goes to Brown University and tries to see the Dean but the secretary told him he was booked the whole day and that he would have to make an appointment. Tim manages to get into the Dean's office through the window. He then proceeds to tell the Dean the truth about Jane.This movie was based on a semi-autobiographical novel by Peter Farrelly. The Farrelly brothers are from Rhode Island and many of their movies are filmed there. I wonder how close this film parallels his real teenage years. It would be interesting to read the book.

The pack of loony-tunes following Grade-Z movie director Edward D. Wood, Jr. around aren't sycophants, they're his family. They're also a very funny, colorful bunch. The picture, shot in gloriously flat black-and-white (which matches the times, and mirrors the films of Ed Wood), has a thin story and is mostly on one-note, but we clearly see what draws people to Wood. The man was a used car-salesman for the movies. Johnny Depp is fine in the lead, most especially in his scenes with an unrecognizable Martin Landau as a drug-addicted Bela Lugosi. When Ed is told Lugosi's health insurance has expired and he must leave the hospital, it's an extremely poignant moment that touches on a lot more than just a hack producer-writer-director struggling to keep his main star going. Burton is very effective at introducing us to a whole troupe of people we might normally recoil from; the director is sympathetic enough not to poke fun at anybody, and he keeps the movie light enough to laugh with. Still, his weaknesses are in evidence here the story structure is sketchy, details are skimmed over, and some of Burton's scenes don't take shape, don't fly. We see an awful lot on the making of Bride of the Atom, but its raucous premiere is too easy a way to explain the public's reaction (was it given a general release? was Ed Wood able to make any money from it?). The large cast is perfectly assembled and, though sometimes the eye-rolling and comedic takes are a little over-the-top, that's all right because the filmmaker's basic take on Ed Wood is the same as ours the man made silly movies, he was a cross-dresser, and he was passionate about both! Tim Burton isn't afraid to get a little silly, but his handsome presentation and genuine feeling for this misfit give the movie a heart and soul. *** from **** ","genre":null},{"date":"18 July 2005","score":"6 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":" Director Tim Burton has always shown his compassionate side for outcasts and eccentrics--their passions make them outcasts, and the fact they don't realize it make them eccentrics.

Cut to 'Chicago Seven Years Later' & Damien (Jonathan Scott-Taylor) is in his early teen & lives with his uncle Richard (William Holden) & aunt Ann Thorn (Lee Grant) who also have a son of their own called Mark (Lucas Donat). Richard & Ann pack both Damien & Mark to 'Davidson Military Academy'. Damien's other aunt named Marion (Sylvia Sidney) knows that Damien is the Antichrist but dies in mysterious circumstance's shortly after trying to tell Richard & Ann the truth. A journalist named Joan Hart (Elizabeth Shepherd) has been investigating around the archaeological site where Micheal & Karl died & has also discovered that Damien is the Antichrist, she too meets a gruesome end when she tries to talk to Richard. Dr. Charles Warren (Nicholas Pryor) also starts to become suspicious of Damien but will he be able to convince his good friend Richard of his nephew's evil before he too falls victim to an 'accident'?Originally started by co-writer Mike Hodges who left after 'creative differences' & completed by director Don Taylor I thought Damien Omen II was a good watchable sequel. The script by Stanley Man & Hodges moves along at a reasonable pace & never becomes too dull or boring, the first half is slower than the second which when it gets going has one demonic killing after another with a scene where a Doctor is cut in half with steel wire & a scene when a journalist has her eyes pecked out by a large crow & subsequently is run over by a huge articulated truck being the stand out killings. Damien's attention this time is focused on business matters with him killing various members of 'Thorn Industries' which he will own eventually, turning the company into a cold-blooded organisation catering for his own needs. Most of the characters a little bland & forgettable with Damien himself not developed that much beyond a teenager who suffers with some personal angst as he becomes aware that he is the Antichrist, he takes it pretty well considering! I thought the twist ending was quite good as well. Director Taylor manages to create some great set-piece killings with the aforementioned two being particularly impressive, there is also a great sequence where a company executive named Bill Atherton (Lew Ayres) gets in Damien's way & ends up under some ice desperately banging as the current drags him further away & stunned spectators above frantically trying to rescue him as he slowly drowns trapped under the rock solid ice. Technically Damien Omen II is very well made & obviously had a reasonable budget, special mentions for the cinematography by Bill Butler & one for composer Jerry Goldsmith who turns in yet another fantastically atmospheric score. There isn't much blood or gore with only the Doctor being sliced in half containing any real grue. The acting is OK & the familiar face of genre favourite Lance Henriksen is here in a small role. Overall I liked Damien Omen II, it is a very well made & an entertaining horror film in it's own right. Having said that it's one of those films where I tend to think that there's nothing wrong with it but at the same time there's nothing outstanding about it either, definitely worth a watch though.

Ryan Phillipe is the leading, narrating it-guy (I think this film actually helped destroy his career). Salma Hayek was the it-girl and played a philandering wife to Breckin Meyer (who, by the way, was HORRIBLY miscast to play her husband- no way Salma would ever touch him). Neve Campbell (all 10 minutes of her) played the soap star on the down, which incidentally mirrored her real-life career as well. Mike Myers as Steve Rubell stole the whole show. He played it with so much charisma, you couldn't help but to root for this freak. And even though Myers didn't look a whole lot like Rubell, he was not his usual over-the-top self and the subtle Linda Richman (SNL) voice he used, made the whole delivery work. Sela Ward had a small role in this as a hot-stuff, wired, record producer, but then again, EVERYONE had minuscule parts. Sherry Stringfield played his strung-out confidant Viv (and looked like she lost weight to the point of being unrecognized), along with Heather Matzarazzo (Welcome to the Dollhouse, The Princess Diaries) as Ryan Phillipe's younger sister.The film had potential. It seemed decent most of the time, and you wanted to know a little more with what was going on in each scene. Yet it seemed more like watching an extended British theatrical trailer. An example was when Shane (Phillipe) is bummed that the magazine he posed for didn't have any text. Well, we never knew he even posed in the first place, but it must've been a piece that was snipped in order not to fully enjoy this subplot. The only problem is that there were multiple scenes that suffered from this same lack of coherence. The movie must have originally been three hours long, but the execs had to snip about half the footage for whatever reason. The result is a contorted, contrived, unremarkable film that doesn't even carry half the songs on film that are embedded in its soundtrack.I did feel (as I did with Boogie Nights) that I was in fact watching a documentary of the late 70s, and old memories of where I was at that time go-go danced in the back of my head. The Director of Photography deserves props (like the DPs to American Psycho & Boogie Nights do). I was only eight when this movie took place, but I remember where I was on New Year's Eve of 1979. But this film unfortunately tried to cram as much '70-isms and references as possible. When Breckin Meyer reaches for his wife, she says, Sit on it! Or when Shane and Meyer are the wild & crazy Czechoslovakian Brothers (Dan Aykroyd & Steve Martin in the '70s heyday of SNL). See my review of Boogie Nights, you'll know what I mean. And I didn't buy that Shane (who wasn't a real sharp tool to begin with) magically goes to NYU and is a manager of a restaurant at the movie's end.All in all, the movie was dramatic in parts where it shouldn't have been; had no humor where it should have; was shorter than it should have been; and had scenes that shouldn't have been. The end credits were cool to watch because of all the celebrities and icons of the time were there Liza Minelli, Martin Scorcese, Farah Fawcett, John Travolta, Sylvester Stallone, and even the Governator of California.Not a bad film, but by no means a good one.

True, I haven't seen any of those movies, but I'm sure they're better than this cheeseball flick.To begin, the movie is dull for the most part. It follows around Balboa through his plainly ordinary life with plainly ordinary shots, and painfully bad dialogue. The acting ain't much better either. Every character in the movie is a caricature, and none of the actors do anything to raise them above that status. Sylvester Stallone's Rocky is the mindless thug with a heart of gold. Despite the fact that he part times as hired muscle for a loan shark, he practically walks around with a halo and choir throughout the rough streets of Philly. Adrian (Talia Shire) is a mousey shut-in, pure and chaste, who does nothing to show why Rocky would be so into her. Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is a cocky, disinterested imitation of Muhammed Ali, Burgess Meredith's Mickey is practically a cartoon character, and there is no scene that Burt Young can't ruin with his ham-handed, oafish, stereotypical portrayal of Adrian's brother Paulie.The movie tries hard, reeeeeally hard to get us to care about the underdog Rocky and his lady-love Adrian. Their made for each other, you know? Nevermind that they're first kiss gives off creepy date rape vibes, they're sweet, especially since she seems mildly retarded. That this film has achieved full-on Spike TV guy movie status is kinda baffling, giving how slow and sentimental it is. You figure that it must be the boxing scenes that redeem it and stand out in the collective guy mind, but then the climactic boxing match between the Italian Stallion and Apollo Creed begins, and you realise that it kinda blows.First off, there are waaaaaaaay too many punches thrown for the early rounds of a heavyweight fight. These things are dances, not slugfests. But, hey, that's okay since this is the action sequence, bring on the violence! Except... that after the brief flurry at the beginning, the movie just skips through most of the fight, a few seconds of round eight, a spit-take from round 11, then the obligatory cut scene to begin round 14 (where the cutman cuts Rocky, not a scene that didn't make the movie). It's ridiculous really, since all of Apollo's pre-fight hype involved him knocking out Rocky in three rounds, and then they skip past the third round. WHO IN THE HECK SETS UP A MOVIE LIKE THAT? And, better yet, who in the heck awards such a movie Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Film Editing? But, the entire movie wasn't a loss for me. Eventually, the big thug won me over (or wore me down), and I looked past how one dimensional he was. I've always been a big fan of his monologue scene before the big fight, where he admits to Adrian that he's nothing more than a bum, but if he could just go the distance with Creed, not beat him, but go the distance, than maybe he'd be something more than a bum. It's still a great scene (albeit cheapened by the sequels where the unpolished fighter beats a better prepared Creed and goes on to be unstoppable). And, when Rocky was training, pounding the beef, drinking the raw eggs, and running the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, I got chills. He's Gonna Fly Now, darnit! But, all in all, not a good movie. I'll give some of the weaker visual sequences a bit of a pass, since it was made for only about $1.1 million dollars, which also explains why some of the performances aren't up to snuff, since they didn't have that many takes (my favourite scene, the aforementioned monologue, was done in one take). But the budget doesn't account for the overall cheesiness of the flick, or the film's treatment of the final climactic battle as an afterthought.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"18 July 2005","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I think I've always avoided this movie, until now, because it's a Jerry Bruckheimer flick, and there's nothing that guy can't dumb down. I really can't think of another producer who leaves such an indelible mark on a film that it's instantly recognisable as his. What other producer is mentioned as often in the marketing of a film than Bruckheimer, often more times than the director? He's become a brand, attaching his name generally means you're gonna get a certain kind of movie, no matter who's behind the lens (this time out, it's Ridley Scott, who received his third Oscar nomination for his work here). So my question going into the film was could Bruckheimer leave his usual brand of tricks behind for the serious subject matter at hand, or would it look like Armageddon in Somolia, or another Pearl Harbour? Well, it's not Armageddon in Somolia, and I'm assuming Black Hawk Down is better than Pearl Harbour (which I've never seen, and probably never will). But... it's still a Bruckheimer flick. He still has to have his slow motion epic shots, complete with swelling score, that just screams HEROES. THESE ARE MEN DOING MANLY THINGS AND YOU WILL CHEER. It's that dedication to aestheticism that prevents what is a pretty good movie from becoming a great movie. It's self-reverential in the worst way, and little more than one large battle scene.It's a pretty impressive battle scene, I'll give you, but it all exists without the proper context or heft that would give it's subject matter the treatment it deserves. The action is furious, the battles feel authentic, the explosions are loud. It's all terribly exciting and engrossing, but empty. Everything that occurs before the battle occurs is tired, clichéd and ordinary. Scott sets up the quirks of the men we will soon see in battle so that we shall care when they are placed in peril. But it feels stunted and obligatory, and not all that different than the montage of characters offered in Armageddon. Particularly weak is the opening of the film, which treats the viewers to six or seven pages of subtitled exposition, explaining the Somolian conflict and what our heroes are doing there (complete with poorly written, ham-handed commentary).Here's the thing about movies they're a visual medium. Use one or two pages of subtitles to begin a movie if you must, but this is a bit excessive. A simple rule is show, don't tell. Even a hackneyed device like having the soldiers watching the news or discussing the newspaper would have been preferable. The whole thing feels so much like an afterthought, that I'm convinced it was one. Test audiences were too confused about what Somolia was all about, so they threw that in there instead of re-shooting a sequence.Bruckheimer can't bear all the blame for the film's short-comings. Ridley Scott is just as prone to sensationalism and aestheticism as is his production partner. As with his recent Kingdom of Heaven, it appears too often that Scott is more interested in setting up a unique and beautiful shot than finding the reasoning behind the sequence. He's all craft with no poetry. As a result, the film looks amazing, the battle is outstanding, but the whole thing leaves me very hollow, and not just because of the war is hell theme that always surrounds such films.While recognising the flaws of Black Hawk Down, I still felt it to be a pretty good movie. And that's because while Scott may be lacking as an artist, he is a master craftsman. The battle is unrelenting and enthralling, and one of the best I've seen for modern combat. While most of the characters are little more than archetypes, I found a few members of the cast really stood out with their performances, particularly Eric Bana as the charismatic Delta Squadron member and Tom Sizemore, who could basically play army guys his whole career and not go wrong.All in all, despite its many flaws, the superlatives out-weigh them. I enjoyed the flick for what it was, while still wishing the story was put in better hands.

Well, it's not Armageddon in Somolia, and I'm assuming Black Hawk Down is better than Pearl Harbour (which I've never seen, and probably never will). But... it's still a Bruckheimer flick. He still has to have his slow motion epic shots, complete with swelling score, that just screams HEROES. THESE ARE MEN DOING MANLY THINGS AND YOU WILL CHEER. It's that dedication to aestheticism that prevents what is a pretty good movie from becoming a great movie. It's self-reverential in the worst way, and little more than one large battle scene.It's a pretty impressive battle scene, I'll give you, but it all exists without the proper context or heft that would give it's subject matter the treatment it deserves. The action is furious, the battles feel authentic, the explosions are loud. It's all terribly exciting and engrossing, but empty. Everything that occurs before the battle occurs is tired, clichéd and ordinary. Scott sets up the quirks of the men we will soon see in battle so that we shall care when they are placed in peril. But it feels stunted and obligatory, and not all that different than the montage of characters offered in Armageddon. Particularly weak is the opening of the film, which treats the viewers to six or seven pages of subtitled exposition, explaining the Somolian conflict and what our heroes are doing there (complete with poorly written, ham-handed commentary).Here's the thing about movies they're a visual medium. Use one or two pages of subtitles to begin a movie if you must, but this is a bit excessive. A simple rule is show, don't tell. Even a hackneyed device like having the soldiers watching the news or discussing the newspaper would have been preferable. The whole thing feels so much like an afterthought, that I'm convinced it was one. Test audiences were too confused about what Somolia was all about, so they threw that in there instead of re-shooting a sequence.Bruckheimer can't bear all the blame for the film's short-comings. Ridley Scott is just as prone to sensationalism and aestheticism as is his production partner. As with his recent Kingdom of Heaven, it appears too often that Scott is more interested in setting up a unique and beautiful shot than finding the reasoning behind the sequence. He's all craft with no poetry. As a result, the film looks amazing, the battle is outstanding, but the whole thing leaves me very hollow, and not just because of the war is hell theme that always surrounds such films.While recognising the flaws of Black Hawk Down, I still felt it to be a pretty good movie. And that's because while Scott may be lacking as an artist, he is a master craftsman. The battle is unrelenting and enthralling, and one of the best I've seen for modern combat. While most of the characters are little more than archetypes, I found a few members of the cast really stood out with their performances, particularly Eric Bana as the charismatic Delta Squadron member and Tom Sizemore, who could basically play army guys his whole career and not go wrong.All in all, despite its many flaws, the superlatives out-weigh them.

I actually think this version might be better, but that's not saying much. It's a shame that Cimino didn't have an Irving Thalberg to reign him in, holding him to creation of the modest western originally planned. The entire catastrophe was set in motion when the director was given carte blanche due to the overwhelming success of The Deerhunter, a film which in fact had little or nothing to do with Cimino's abilities but rather select acting performances and, as in Heaven's Gate, the breathtaking cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond aided by an audience ripe with anti-Viet Nam War sentiment. The right place at the right time, this film was an opportunity of circumstance. Worthy of note is Cimino's ability to master the scope of enormous crowds and create spectacle in this film as he had done previously. There are many flashes of brilliance, the dizzying waltz at the beginning of the picture, the panorama of the roller-skating fiddler in the immigrant's meeting hall, the introduction of Christopher Walkin's character, Nathan Champion, through the hole in a sheet made by his shotgun blast as he kills a cattle thief and an excess of wonderful tracking, crane and aerial shots.

To be honest i think they were just stupid..there is another possibility. They didn't bother to see the movie before voting, they just saw the trailer and didn't understand it, so they voted. The director of this movie is, in my opinion, the best director of all times, after Charlie Chaplin and anyone who has seen at least 100 movies and understood them could easily agree. Thank you..
