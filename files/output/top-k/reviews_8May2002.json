He takes out old mobsters who can barely move to start out with and watch cartoons and make ungodly dumb jokes and he gets taken out by his master who doesn't know the first thing about being a samurai like Forest and Forest can't do anything about it? My friend and I laughed constantly throughout this movie and wondering why it was made. What is the deal with the dog thats following him, is Forest supposed to morph into a dog and thats why hes there to help the plot along? I suppose the company ran out of money on the unreal special effects to pull that off. The only way hes a samurai is the quotes he gives from actual samurais, he never uses a sword except to practice, he uses a gun which any hitman in the world can do. What is funny what he does after he kills someone, the way he puts the gun back in his holster, is that supposed to wow us or something? Hell I have seen pet rocks with more creativity.This movie is horrible, dont waste your time in seeing it, dont ever recommend it to your friends or you won't have those friends for much longer. I can't even imagine how this film got a 7.7 here, this is the epitomy of bad. My friend and I have made a pact, if we see anyone in our presence or knowledge that is going to see this film, we will do whatever it takes to prevent that atrocity.

It appears that 50,000 plus people were affected by this movie enough to write about it. Oh I know, the masses are all wrong and I am enlightened because I can analyze plots, acting, direction, music score, lighting, etc.(Which always makes me wonder about who is enlightened about the enlightened people?)I will quote one of my favorite professor's of poetry - Prof. Moon. It is not what a poem says that is important but how it makes you feel. I believe this applies to films too. Sure to many LOTR is over-rated. So is the Jabberwocky, but it makes me feel good. It is a great movie that takes you somewhere else. So this then, is a top notch film, and if it makes number one then so be it. (Actually, I enjoyed it more than The Godfather.)Now the review of certain elements ;)Ok, now that I have read the book again, I still love the movie. This is coming from a person that helped his brothers paint their room with a HOBBIT mural - all without permission from mom of course. My family, from my mother on down to the youngest of us were enraptured in 1974 with Tolkein and his works. Middle-earth has been a favorite character of ours - like a welcome neighbor that pops his head in every once in a while. And when Mr. Jackson decided to come out with a movie version with actual actors on a screen, I cringed. How can a movie match a child's imagination. (It does rather well, but you must remember that it is an adaptation!)The story has a simple premise, good vs. evil. But how fearful the evil!! All creatures, small and great, tremble at the mention of MORDOR - think of a fallen angel and you'll have a good idea of his history. And the movie gives us many a good suggestion of his might. But the power of evil and Mordor lies in its focus - it wants one thing and it consumes all in its path. The world has changed and many powerful allies have disappeared. Good's former strength is diminished.The story then is about how good regroups to form new leadership, alliances and powerbases while evil has no such problems. It is the story of the changing of the guard, from one age of wonder to a different and more pragmatic one. If this interests you then these three movies will grab you. If you read the book(s) though understand this Mr. Jackson changed parts here and there.Things that could have been changedI would have included the trip to the Lady Galadriel. Sorry Mr. Jackson but it would have given us an idea of what the world was like before Mordor stained and tired it.The representation of the elves. To me they come across as cold and not that important. This story is their swan song. They are passing out of the world of magic into the world as we know it. I expected to see more warmth, wisdom and a sadness from having seen too much evil.Things that I enjoyedThe Shire - In the movie the Shire is well... the Shire!! The Hobbits are good people all around if you spend the time to get to know them.Gandalf, Bilbo and Frodo Baggins - Okay, you know they did a good job when you read a book and you see Ian Mckellen there instead of the wizard you imagined before. IMO this is far far better than a silly Oscar.Even though many lines are changed I still enjoyed the characterizations of Sam Gamgee, Merry and Pippin. They should be in their 50's as hobbits, but hey - it's Hollywood. Nevertheless, they really are Hobbits.Arwen - She did not need to take Glorfindel's role to be introduced earlier on but it works and she is great. Really she plays a much more important role later in the trilogy.The dark riders, Moria, the Balrog - Mr. Jackson understands how to communicate evil - brrrrr - it really is that good.

The older films didn't show us enough power of the jedis and they were also a dying race in the old films. Here we see them in their full might and it seems that every citizen is scared of them.

I believe that this movie will be regarded as one of the better films when the saga is complete in 2005. But if one states a claim, he must prove it and I shall with these points.1) The special effects A Star Wars film isn't one without the amazing special effects and this film happens to have the best one in the whole series. Although it has an advantage as it was made 20 years after the original, nevertheless the special effects are the best. The pod races are probably one of the most trilling race sequences put together and the creatures look more believable as they are given more flesh with the aid of a computer.2) The light saber duels The Phantom menace has the best light saber duels out of the whole series. Seeing Qui Gon Jinn and a younger Obi Wan Kenobi duking it out with Darth Maul will bring yelps of excitement out of a any Star Wars fan.3) The force With this film, we witness the Jedi Council as they once were and the Jedis for what mighty warriors they were, and also the force is very strong with this film. The older films didn't show us enough power of the jedis and they were also a dying race in the old films. Here we see them in their full might and it seems that every citizen is scared of them. We understand the responsibilities and power that comes with becoming a jedi.4) The Story While episode 1 was criticized for having a boring story. One must look at the fact that the galaxy wasn't in turmoil at that time so something as trivial as a route tax was big for them. This movie showed us how peaceful the galaxy was before vader and the emperor decided to terrorize it. It also gives us great character analyzation for vader instead of people remembering him as a man with a hockey max who couldn't breath well.Hopefully with this points, some of you may realize as I have come to realize that Episode 1 deserves its rightful place in the trilogy as the one that started it all.Premise A federation aims to capture the small planet of Naboo to pressure the senate to conform to thier views.Episode 1 was nominated for a couple of razzies.Grade 9.8\/10 (An underappeciated classic) ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"8 May 2002","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  I purchased a used VHS copy of this film and the local Video store,for only $2.99 - I had never seen this film,and I thought it would be something that I'd like. and the truth is that I do like this film, its not a film I can watch again and again.

Young men, who weren't even over the age of twenty-one, were exposed to unspeakable horrors.  Thousands of young men died, hundreds of others were physically and emotionally scarred for the rest of their lives.  What makes this fact even more relevant today are all of the war movies that Hollywood has been producing recently.  These movies include Born on the Fourth of July (1989), Hamburger Hill (1987), and the much recent We Were Soldiers (2002).  All three of these movies are based on true Vietnam survivor stories.  Born on the Fourth of July, the first of these films I'll talk about, starred Tom Cruise.  The story was about Ron Kovic, an all-American teenager who went to Nam, with high hopes of being able to serve his country proud.  Not even a year into his first tour of duty, Ron was wounded and was paralyzed from the chest down.  He returned home and endured a very unpleasant stay in a veteran's hospital.  He comes home only to discover that he may not be very welcome because of fighting overseas.  Despite all that, he would soon go on to become an anti-war activist.  Even though he lost the ability to ever be able to walk again, he had not lost his will to live a good life.  Hamburger Hill was about a platoon of soldiers who were trying to climb a hill that once conquered would be a crucial strategic point in the war.  These brave men endured enemy fire, as well as friendly fire, pouring rain, an ever-growing sense of dread, and unbelievable loss of manpower.  Still, aside from all of these elements of tragedy, they were eventually able overcome that hill.  We Were Soldiers, the most recent of these films, which starred Mel Gibson, was about a group of soldiers, primarily young fathers, brothers and sons, who were able to fight bravely despite being surrounded by enemy forces.  Even with all of these excellent war films, we've forgotten something.  All of these films glorify soldiers overcoming powerful odds and tragedies and they've all been portrayed in a positive manner.  So what happens when our American soldiers become something that we could never imagine?  Keeping this question in mind, this brings me to Brian De Palma's forgotten war drama, Casualties of War.The main story of Casualties of War is that it is a morality tale.  A platoon of five soldiers goes into a Vietnamese village on a reconnaissance mission and kidnaps a young girl.  They then proceed to rape her.  One of the men refused to go along with the others.  After the rape, the young soldier tells the girl that he's going to try to get her out of there.  The other soldiers while trying to escape catch him.  Then the platoon, with the girl still in tow, proceeds on their way.  They then encounter enemy fire.  In the fray, the young soldier sees his chance to try to get the girl out of there.  The platoon sergeant sees the girl trying to escape and then orders the other men to shoot her.  They do so and the girl falls to her death.  After the incident, the platoon returns to base camp.  The young soldier who refused to go along with the others then reports to his lieutenant about the incident.  He's informed that something like this could severely damage the United States military and it's position in the war.  The other four soldiers are tried in a military court and are sentenced to lengthy prison terms for the crime.  The incident was never mentioned by anyone after that.  It was not until a newspaper article, which a book then followed had been published about the incident that it would ever be brought to public attention.  This is Brian De Palma's best movie behind The Untouchables.  I'm surprised that this movie hasn't gained the attention that it so righteously deserves in the long period of time that it's been on video.  Brian De Palma doesn't shy the camera away when it comes down to the rape scene.  We see the young girl screaming and we also see all of the men's reactions to the horrors at large.  I actually had to turn my head during the rape scene.  Hamburger Hill is another forgotten war movie that hasn't gotten much attention either.  The reason that movie is so good is that it shows men at their greatest when things are at their worst.  Michael J. Fox, who plays the new recruit, Eriksson, is excellent.  It was nice to him a really good serious role for once.  I think that performances like the one Fox gives in this movie are rare.  Sean Penn, who plays Meserve, is a monster in this film.  We see a war-torn veteran, who is only trying to survive his last few weeks in Vietnam.  When a friend is killed in an ambush, this causes Meserve's already stemming hatred for the Vietnamese to go even further.  It is now that we see Penn go into overdrive.  He is so intimidating, that as one viewer already claimed, that it's easy to see how a weak person could easily come under his control.  The supporting performances I think are some of the best.  Don Harvey and John C. Reilly both give great performances as the two soldiers who basically follow Meserve's every command.  John Leguizamo, who plays Diaz, the newest soldier to the platoon, is great in an early performance.  You see, when Meserve first says that he and the rest of the men are going to rape the young Vietnamese girl, Diaz decides that he won't participate.  Diaz says that he will back up Eriksson when it comes down to it.  Eriksson agrees that he will back up Diaz as well.  When it's Eriksson's turn to rape the girl, he looks at Diaz to back him up.  Meserve, Clark, and Hatcher then begin calling Eriksson names like fag and queer when he refuses.  Diaz, seeing the kind of ridicule that Eriksson just went through chickens out and goes into the hut with the girl.       It seems to me though, that Diaz is the only soldier out of the four that anyone can ever really have any sympathy towards.  I mean you have to feel sorry for him especially even though it wasn't really his fault for going along with the others in the rape.  If you think about it very carefully, you'll realize that he was FORCED into the rape.  This is a very debatable topic here because obviously Diaz is a person with morals, something the other three soldiers lacked.  Of course, one could easily blame him for not using common sense for going along with the soldiers, but what you have to understand is that it was peer pressure that made him do it.  All that happened was that he simply cracked under pressure.  Another thing that you have to remember is that this is set during a very stressful time and it's easy for anyone, even a person with good morals, to commit an unthinkable act.  Why do you think good people go badly all of a sudden?I agree with one previous viewer that the Vietnam War truly brought out the worst in our American soldiers.  I've heard horrible stories about some people who claimed that the only reason that they enlisted into the United States army during that time was so that they could kill Vietnamese people.  I know of one person who says that if he were of legal age, he would sign up to go into Afghanistan, just to kill some f*****g Arabs.  It is exactly this kind of attitude that leads to atrocities like the one depicted in the film.  How many things like this really happened during the Vietnam War more so, the war in Afghanistan?  If so, how long will it be before they're brought to public attention?  I mean it took, what how long for the incident in Casualties of War to be brought to public attention, two years?  Two years may not seem like much, but think about the family of that innocent girl who was wrongfully taken away from her home and was forced to service four out of five soldiers.  How those four men raped that young girl and then killed her and not have any regrets whatsoever is beyond anyone.I think myself and everybody else, who has studied the causes of the Vietnam War, knows that the whole thing was a big mistake.  As stated above, young men were exposed to horrible conditions and were fighting a war that they are not even sure should have been fought.  I've heard that some soldiers did not even know why they were fighting.  So in conclusion, I really love this movie, but it's obvious that some people will hate it.  I think that before someone says, this movie sucks! that it would be best to keep some of these things in mind.  Things like morality and the differences between right and wrong are all topics that need to be kept in mind when viewing this film.

There's a couple of lesbian love scenes, with clear and explicit nudity, for those who think Hollywood movies have become too prudish lately.

Now, I already posted another review of this movie that infact praises Spider-Man. I gave it a 10 out of 10 rating, and I recommended it to everyone who hadn't seen it yet. I am a true child of the movies, I love going to them, I love Hollywood, and I will love it until the day I die.First off, I'm not trying to come down on anyone in this post, I'm posting a general statement to people who nitpick about movies (but with references to Spider-Man). I'm not an employee of any movie studio, nor am I some marketing exec trying to brainwash you guys. I am nothing more than a movie buff who was pleasantly surprised at what turned out to be a very well crafted movie.Ok, the action left something to be desired, I wish I could have seen some more hand-to-hand combat between Spidey and The Green Goblin. I wish I could have seen some more scenes of Peter Parker discovering his new skills. But as I type this, I am reminded that what makes good movies is the fact that you are left wanting more. Spiderman is a comic that has as many dramatic and heartfelt elements as it does action elements. Sam Raimi did a great job of capturing the motivations of the characters, choosing to develop them rather than have them be pawns being moved from one action scene to the next. Sam Raimi does a similar thing with his classic Darkman, where our hero is a tortured sole caught between two worlds and must hide his true self away from his loved ones. Tobey Maguire plays the part perfectly, putting just the right amount of geekiness in his character. But even before he gets bitten, there is a twinkle in his eye, I could see something about Peter Parker that was more than just the geek exterior, and it prevented his character from becoming a stereotypical nerd (which a lesser actor would have done easily). Kirsten Dunst is cute, but her wet t-shirt\/sweater\/dress\/whole body scene was purely gratuitous (remember Halle Berry in Swordfish?). I hate her a lot less in this movie than in her other movies, and she was actually convincing as Mary Jane, right down to the hair color. James Franco as Harry Osborn is very good, and looks like he could be Willem Dafoe's son in real life (it's the cheekbones). I'm sure we will see more of Franco's Osborn in the sequel. Which moves us to Willem Dafoe...yes, the mask is a bit halloweenish, but it's a realistic twist on an otherwise unrealistic character. His portrayal of The Green Goblin was dead on, even the voice was good. His performance was multi-layered and very intoxicating. Even as he is going crazy, the scenes with his son are very interesting and even believable. The talking to the mask scene was pretty silly, but Dafoe does the best he can, and that's all I ask.All in all, Sam Raimi's Spiderman is a great film. It is one of my all time favorites (along with a laundry list of others)and deserves to be part of the ranks of Batman and Superman. I believe it captured the spirit of the comic book perfectly, and without a re-imagined feel to it, it feels authentic and even a little 50's-ish. Finally a summer blockbuster with some substance to it, and a over hyped movie that delivers on its hype (at least in my opinion).Frankly I'm just tired of the nitpickers who insist that everything has to be perfectly adapted from the book. Look people, it's a MOVIE. Our physical representations of feelings we all get from reading the book are not going to be exactly the same as the filmmakers', nor should they be. Let's face it, the movie will almost never be as good as the book, so don't ask it to be. I'm a big reader, and when they turn books into movies, I have certain doubts about the adaptation, but I just sit back and remember that a movie cannot capture everything a book has to offer. As for the people who saw it and didn't like the lack of action...well...I can sympathize, but go see it again, you might appreciate the story more when you see it a second time.The bottom line is that people who viciously nitpick about stuff that they can't do any better themselves are missing out on the good stuff about Spider-Man, and I think that it pays to be a little more realistic when it comes to movies.

Good, I say. I look forward to all those films that haven't been tainted by Hollywood's monetary grip.Firstly, I'd rather not write a review that details every scene. I prefer to not ruin the movie experience for those not fortunate enough to have seen it already. However, I'll still mention a few moments that set it apart from all others.This movie is about prejudice and love, about close-mindedness and the power of friendship. When you watch the movie for the first time, you get the feeling of a community very much cut off from the world and reality. It has a very 'desert island feel' about it. There is actually so much discrimination in this movie as to be rather frightening in its true-to-life nature.Sam Rockwell plays Trent in his finest performance on-screen to date. He was actually a superb choice for this movie, having the perfect 'look' for the part. He befriends 10 year old Devon (the astonishing Mischa Barton who should, in my opinion, have been Oscar nominated). Devon is innocent, sweet and trusting - who has yet to be corrupted or taught to discriminate against others of a lower status than her. Morton and Clare (Christopher McDonald and Kathleen Quinlan) brilliantly play her parents who attempt to pry Devon away from Trent throughout the course of the film, trying to make foul of any kindness he has shown her. This makes for painful, yet brilliantly viewable scenes of maliciousness.There is of course the blatant moral nature of this movie. An obvious one is to look at oneself before judging others. One simple example of this is the scene with Quinlan in her back garden (which I won't spoil). Morton is so wrapped up in the affairs of his daughter and Trent that he fails to notice his own wife. The irony of this is so perfectly fitting and is not resolved by the end of the movie. Angie Harmon plays the user and abuser girlfriend very well which just furthers the point the director was trying to get across. Trent is used physically and emotionally in this movie and you can't help but pity his useless situation. Normally when one watches a movie (generally Hollywood movies) you can shout out 'but why didn't you do 'x'?! In the case of Lawn Dogs you find yourself in the troubling position of not knowing what to tell Trent to do. The 'not knowing' makes for interesting viewing as the tale unfolds.Many people have complained about the fairy-tale nature of the ending, but I see it as beautiful and fitting. This movie is not a fairy-tale. The ending is not wrapped up by any means. Who says the magic at the end of the movie actually happened? Perhaps Trent threw the various items out of his truck as a testament to how strong his friendship with Devon was? Perhaps he imagined the magic as a result of Devon's love? Perhaps, in this community of discriminators, the love from an innocent child took him away at speed from those who would hold him down.I'll let you decide.As the end credits roll, you don't receive the satisfaction that only Hollywood can give you when the good guy shoots the bad guy. You're given the satisfaction that friendship and love has won through, but not in the dramatic way only Hollywood can give you. What else really matters?To sum up, Lawn Dogs is such a sparkling gem that didn't need Hollywood's money to buy it, and is all the better for that. A wonderful film I highly recommend. Watch it by yourself in a quiet room and let it envelop you.(Apologies if some parts of the review didn't make sense - I'd rather leave the discovering part for when\/if you actually watch the movie.)

There is actually so much discrimination in this movie as to be rather frightening in its true-to-life nature.Sam Rockwell plays Trent in his finest performance on-screen to date. He was actually a superb choice for this movie, having the perfect 'look' for the part. He befriends 10 year old Devon (the astonishing Mischa Barton who should, in my opinion, have been Oscar nominated). Devon is innocent, sweet and trusting - who has yet to be corrupted or taught to discriminate against others of a lower status than her. Morton and Clare (Christopher McDonald and Kathleen Quinlan) brilliantly play her parents who attempt to pry Devon away from Trent throughout the course of the film, trying to make foul of any kindness he has shown her. This makes for painful, yet brilliantly viewable scenes of maliciousness.There is of course the blatant moral nature of this movie. An obvious one is to look at oneself before judging others. One simple example of this is the scene with Quinlan in her back garden (which I won't spoil). Morton is so wrapped up in the affairs of his daughter and Trent that he fails to notice his own wife. The irony of this is so perfectly fitting and is not resolved by the end of the movie. Angie Harmon plays the user and abuser girlfriend very well which just furthers the point the director was trying to get across. Trent is used physically and emotionally in this movie and you can't help but pity his useless situation. Normally when one watches a movie (generally Hollywood movies) you can shout out 'but why didn't you do 'x'?! In the case of Lawn Dogs you find yourself in the troubling position of not knowing what to tell Trent to do. The 'not knowing' makes for interesting viewing as the tale unfolds.Many people have complained about the fairy-tale nature of the ending, but I see it as beautiful and fitting. This movie is not a fairy-tale. The ending is not wrapped up by any means. Who says the magic at the end of the movie actually happened? Perhaps Trent threw the various items out of his truck as a testament to how strong his friendship with Devon was? Perhaps he imagined the magic as a result of Devon's love? Perhaps, in this community of discriminators, the love from an innocent child took him away at speed from those who would hold him down.I'll let you decide.As the end credits roll, you don't receive the satisfaction that only Hollywood can give you when the good guy shoots the bad guy. You're given the satisfaction that friendship and love has won through, but not in the dramatic way only Hollywood can give you. What else really matters?To sum up, Lawn Dogs is such a sparkling gem that didn't need Hollywood's money to buy it, and is all the better for that. A wonderful film I highly recommend.

A lot of people here compare Spiderman to the Batman movies, but in actuality, Spiderman is very close in tone to Superman II and the second-half of Superman The Movie, (although Superman II BADLY needs a special edition since it looks a bit aged). In fact, it seems to me that Sam Raimi (allegedly a fan of the Superman movies) gave a nod to Superman when he had Peter Parker running, and opening his shirt to reveal the Spiderman costume, which Reeve did in the opening moments of Superman II and in his first transition in Superman The Movie.My only complaints about the movie was that the special effects were,  at times, somewhat unconvincing and the musical score lacked the majesty of the Superman and Batman themes. However, the creators of the films were able to emphasize their energy on equally, if not, more important details.I agree entirely with film critics who said Raimi and the writers were able to find the right dosage of action, drama, sympathy and humor in the story. And the result is a satisfying movie with good performances to match and mostly very good special effects to culminate with one of the best films to be based on a mainstream action-oriented character.Tobey McGuire is to Spiderman what Christopher Reeve was to Superman. McGuire BECAME Spiderman. His transformation from a picked-on teenager to superhero was wonderful acting, and I'll be looking forward to his next outing as the wall-crawler. Willem DaFoe was outstanding, as usual. I'd rank his crazed-interpretation of the Green Goblin to be up there with Jack Nicholson's The Joker. There are no lame performances in the film. Kirsten Dunst, although some say she didn't have a lot to work with, was wonderful as Mary Jane. Contrary to critics who preferred the second half of the film, I was more intrigued with Peter's growth and relationship with Mary Jane than when he engaged the Green Goblin in obligatory battle. Don't get me wrong, I also enjoyed the action, but we all know what super-hero movies are predictably about good vs. evil. What makes them special and what sets some comic\/action films apart from others are the characterizations between the kicking ass. It's the stuff that the very best super-hero films are made of Superman I, Superman II, Batman Returns, X-Men and Spiderman are all examples of comic films that delivered the action, but also had interesting character relationships in between to bring us closer to the characters we like.No doubt the iconoclastic film buffs will come out of the woodwork in droves and look for any reason to bash Spiderman, but make no mistake. If you're even a casual fan of characters like Spiderman and don't get too caught up in the hype, you should be in for a great time.

What met me was three times that!! Sam Raimi blew me away with what is probably the best Super Hero film ever made. It wasn't dark, but it wasn't light-hearted, the phenomenal thing about this movie was that it was real. The world around Peter Parker and Spiderman was our world. Raimi did not Comic Book-ize the world like they did for Batman or Superman movies. It was our world, it was like looking right out our front windows. Tobey Maquire was the ideal choice for the run of the mill kid, who is picked on and misunderstood and pining for the beautiful popular girl. The popular girl is played by Kirsten Dunst who we know can look like a goddess or in this case, truly, actually look like the girl next door. Raimi is brilliant...this movie was filmed in what I call real-life. He took a fantasy about a kid bit by a spider and brought Spiderman into the real world. Maguire and Dunst both look like the average kid and I don't think a lot of make up was used to cover their imperfections and blemishes. Instead Raimi allowed them to look like human beings. The story for Spiderman follows true to the comics. Peter Parker, while on a school trip is bit by a genetically altered Spider and wakes up the next morning, stronger, faster, healthier, with enhanced...well everything. Immediately thinking of his own personal gain, Parker uses his powers to take on a wrestler and when he's cheated by the wrestling promoter he gets even by allowing a crook to rob the Promoter. Moments later Parker discovers that by letting that crook get away his beloved Uncle Ben (who is like Peter's father) is murdered by that crook. From that moment on Peter Parker vows to fight injustice with the words of Uncle Ben ringing in his ears...with great power, comes great responsibility. This movie spans the course of several years in Peter's life and Raimi covers that whole time without making us feel rushed or crammed together...instead it flows together, and leaves us riveted to the screen. Franco and Dafoe play Father and Son, and Dafoe during a experiment loses his mind and his personality is split into the Green Goblin who uses top secret Military technology to destroy the city. Dafoe is just brilliant as the evil Green Goblin and his alter ego, the suave Dr. Osbourn. Franco who plays Harry Osbourn, Peter Parker's best friend looks and acts so much like Dafoe that they are the most believable father and son in movies in years. The story is so depthy and full of emotion and action. The computer generated effects at times are almost cartoonish which I always HATE but Raimi uses enough effects mixed with live action that it flows well and you don't notice the computerized Spiderman nearly as much. Spiderman himself is also amazing as he should be. The costume and Maquire playing him make him the greatest hero on screen in years. This movie is so fantastic because it is so SIMPLISTIC!! It's like you're watching right down town Hometown. I honestly don't know if Raimi could pull off a sequel with the same quite subtlty and simplicity but I would love to see him try. I would pay the 10 bucks to not only see a sequel but I would even love to see Spiderman again. The running time was the better part of two hours and it was the perfect length.

Amazing acting (especially Watts), haunting music and visuals, and a keen sense of style.  However, there are some definite elements to this film that completely escape meMany of these are *SPOILERS*; please read if you have seen the film, however.20 quick questions1.

","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"8 May 2002","score":"","review":" This is my first experience with a film directed by the acclaimed Spanish film maker, Pedro Almodóvar. It is very complex on both a technical and emotional level.It is first and foremost a kind of absurdist parody of contemporary life with Almodóvar simultaneously questioning bourgeois values and celebrating the community of those with alternative life styles. He makes the burghers in the audience feel uneasy in their assumptions, especially about questions of gender and about the lifestyle of cross-dressers and gender-unspecific\/variable people, who, he wants us to know, live and breath and love and hate just like anybody else.Cecile Roth stars as Manuela, who is a nurse at a hospital in Madrid where she helps to coordinate the organ donor programs. She is also an amateur actress who plays in the simulations that the hospital makes to educate staff and patients. Her 17-year-old son with whom she is very close tells her she is a great actress, but Manuela is modest. She is also secretive about his father's identity. After seeing a production of Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire, the son and the mother await outside the stage door so that he can get an autograph from the actress who plays Blanche Dubois, Marisa Paredes, who is named Huma Rojo in the film. Tragedy ensues as the son is hit and fatally injured. In just one of a number of plot mixings that emphasize the sometimes tragic and often ironic nature of the human experience, the son becomes an organ donor before he dies, and Manuela, who had previously arranged for organ donations, now has to sign the papers to donate the organs of her beloved son.Now she goes to Barcelona to look up the father, who had once played the crude and boorish Stanley Kowalski to her Stella, again from A Streetcar Named Desire. In Barcelona Manuela again sees the play, but this time meets the star, Huma, who is a grande old dame of the Spanish theater, a Lesbian genius who has taken her theatrical cue in life from Bette Davis (and her smoking habits as well). In a salute to Davis and a remembrance of one of her greatest roles, we see posters of Bette Davis from the classic Hollywood film, All About Eve (1950), and then a kind of take off on the action as Manuela becomes in a sense Eve Harrington as she befriends Huma and begins working for her. (Waiting outside the stage door for a autograph is also a scene from All About Eve.) Nina (Candela Peña) Huma's heroin-addicted lover becomes jealous and accuses Manuela of seeking Huma's friendship just so she can become a star herself, a la Eve Harrington. To top it off Manuela is called upon to play Stella when Nina cannot because of an overdose, and miraculously she relives her role from twenty years before, and does a great job, because she is, as her son knew, a gifted actress.Okay, we can see the complexities. I have merely given the premise of the film. Enter now Antonia San Juan as Agrado, an old friend of Manuela's who is a professional transvestite. (San Juan is brilliant in the part as a woman playing a man playing a woman.) Enter also Penélope Cruz as a pregnant nun with AIDs. What evolves is a kind of sisterhood among variously gendered females. There is also a sense of a middle class, soap opera-ish even, action and resolution, but with Almodóvar's tongue firmly in cheek.Men, however, do not come off very well in this film. The grandfather-to-be apparently has Alzheimer's and does not even recognize his daughter. Manuela's son is dead. A theater male is depicted as a kind of stagehand Stanley Kowalski, boorishly insensitive, seeking only his own pleasure; indeed Tennessee Williams's crude, animalistic Kowalski appears as a metaphor for men in this film. Manuela is his long-suffering Stella, and Huma has always, as she actually says, depended on the kindness of strangers. Finally, there is Lola a tall, handsome, gender-modified Kowalski, played inadequately by Toni Cantó, in what may be a bit of purposely bad casting for effect by Almodóvar--or perhaps I should say, played shallowly and unconvincingly on purpose by Toni Cantó. It's hard to tell. Indeed part of Almodóvar's technique is a blurring of distinctions with ironic parallels, showing how some things are the same, but different depending on your point of view, the organ donors, Lola's fatherhood, Manuela as Stella and\/or Eve, etc.Bottom line this is an unsettling film, brilliantly acted by Paredes, Roth and San Juan, and cleverly directed in a most original style by Almodóvar. It will not play well with Disney aficionados or with devotees of action cinema--and put the kiddies to bed, please.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!
