The acting, writing, and directing all leave much to be desired. Though there are some interesting killings, there aren't enough to save the contrived plot.From very early on, we see some logical lapses that raise a red flag about the quality of the material. First of all, after Tommy Jarvis arrives at the half-way house, we see him take a large pocket knife out of his bag. Now do you really think an unbalanced mental patient with a history of violence would be allowed to carry anything like that? Would the staff at the mental ward he came from not have searched him for such weapons daily? Next, we see a squad car pull up to the facility carrying a couple of trespassing teens back to where they belong. One thing that struck me was the fact that the lights and siren were blaring as the car pulled up. Now, would the police have really needed to use the lights and sirens just to bring the two kids back? Not at all. There are plenty of lapses in logic like that throughout the film. How about after Vic chops up his victim? He's sitting in the back of a squad car with not one drop of blood visible on his clothes, yet look at all the blood on the sheet covering the body! As the story unfolds, we see numerous murders take place. Is Tommy Jarvis the killer? If there was anyone who saw this film and was surprised that Roy was really the killer, then I pity them. The screenplay couldn't make that fact any more obvious. From the ghoulish look on his face when he sees his son's body, to the shot of him closing the ambulance door after the sheriff says we've got a maniac out here!, it's pretty obvious that Roy is our killer. I have no problem with them trying to put a twist in the formula like that, but they could have at least tried to make it a little more difficult to figure out.The film sinks to deplorable lows by having most of the victims be troubled (or in one case completely retarded) kids. Some of the victims are just innocent people caught in the path of the killer. I felt terrible for poor old gramps and that homeless man who are killed for no reason at all. There is gratuitous nudity at every turn, as well.

The film has gained a cult following over the years and it is well-deserved.They Live is the story of an out of work drifter named John Nada(Roddy Piper)who has just arrived in L.A looking for work. When he finally finds a job, he meets up with a co-worker named Frank(Keith David) who becomes Nada's friend. Frank tells Nada that there's a place called Justiceville that takes care of the homeless and unemployed. When Justiceville is raided by the police, Nada looks through the damage and finds a box of sunglasses and when Nada puts on a pair the sunglasses reveal that the rich humans are actually aliens controlling and influencing everyday life and Nada tries to warn and tell people but it's not going to be easy.One of the reasons They Live is a great film and works so well is because it's just as relevant as it was back in 1988. The themes of people becoming poor,losing their jobs and the economy going bad relates to what's going on now in our society. Carpenter always said that this was a commentary on the Reagan era in the 1980s where the rich were getting richer and the poor were growing poorer. Carpenter sets the tone for the film in the first ten minutes showing people that are homeless and losing their jobs. You'll relate to John Nada when he's trying to look for a job in the harsh and troubling economy. If you take out the Action and Science Fiction the stuff with the economy and homeless would seem like something out of the news or a realistic documentary. It's that accurate. Instead of using humans,Carpenter uses aliens as the villains who are posing as rich human beings taking over society. Carpenter gives us a dark,eerie,paranoid,apocalyptic view as if the world was falling apart and you don't know who trust and who's human. You say that Carpenter was continuing his themes of paranoia and human beings from The Thing where human beings are paranoid and afraid of the aliens and of each other which are great themes and those same themes work here as well. What I also love about the film is the Humor and satire in this film where television and advertisements have subliminal messages underneath and also mocking the rich and the consumer culture when during the 1980s most people were about getting rich,making a lot of money and living good lives,but They Live turns that idea on it's head and offers a funny and biting satire of the era. Carpenter's commentary and jab at the Reagan era is very much dead on. John Nada is another classic Carpenter Anti-Hero we can relate to because he is down to earth and a human being that keeps his head on his shoulders and keeps his cool when he starts to go after the aliens but is also tough and cool individual that doesn't messing around. They Live is a Western in disguise and John Nada like other Carpenter Antiheros is a modern day Western cowboy instead trying to survive in the Wild West is trying to survive against Aliens in a big city The Action sequences in the film are well done with great shootouts and intensity and has one of the finest,longest,greatest fight scenes in film history. The fight scene is brutal,long and funny and at times you feel like it will go on forever,it's one of the most realistic fight scenes I've ever seen because you can feel those punches and kicks almost like you're in the scene yourself. It's Five great minutes of fighting you'll never forget. Great scene. The film also has one of the greatest lines in film history and will be quoted forever thanks to Roddy Piper. A great line. For a film made on a 4 million dollar budget the special effects are outstanding and at times makes the film look like it cost 40 million. Carpenter is a master at making a low budget film look like 70 million dollar film. The ending of the film is classic and funny and is a wonderful cap off to the film and is one of the things that makes They Live a great movie.Roddy Piper is great as John Nada bringing a cool and calm feel to the role and when Piper gets into the action,Piper says great one liners and kicks ass. No wonder Roddy Piper is one of the best pro wrestlers of all time. The Underrated Keith David is wonderful as Frank,Nada's co-worker and friend,with David bringing the same intensity and depth he brings to a lot of performances. Meg Foster does a fine job as Holly,a person that Nada meets and is trying to tell her what's going on. Carpenter actors George'Buck'Flower(Drifter)and Peter Jason(Gilbert)give great performances as does Raymond St. Jacques(Street Preacher)who is great in his small role. The direction by John Carpenter is brilliant. Carpenter moves the camera slowly and giving the film a great atmosphere especially during the black and white sequences with the aliens. The action scenes by Carpenter excellent and well-done with tightness and great editing. Great job,JohnThe score by Carpenter and Alan Howarth is excellent mixing together Western,Blues and Jazz that perfectly matches the tone of the film. It's probably my favorite Carpenter score.John carpenter's They Live is to put it simply a great and one of Carpenter's best.If you love Sci\/Fi,Action and Cult films I suggest you see this film. Highly Recommended. 10\/10.

When he finally finds a job, he meets up with a co-worker named Frank(Keith David) who becomes Nada's friend. Frank tells Nada that there's a place called Justiceville that takes care of the homeless and unemployed. When Justiceville is raided by the police, Nada looks through the damage and finds a box of sunglasses and when Nada puts on a pair the sunglasses reveal that the rich humans are actually aliens controlling and influencing everyday life and Nada tries to warn and tell people but it's not going to be easy.One of the reasons They Live is a great film and works so well is because it's just as relevant as it was back in 1988. The themes of people becoming poor,losing their jobs and the economy going bad relates to what's going on now in our society. Carpenter always said that this was a commentary on the Reagan era in the 1980s where the rich were getting richer and the poor were growing poorer. Carpenter sets the tone for the film in the first ten minutes showing people that are homeless and losing their jobs. You'll relate to John Nada when he's trying to look for a job in the harsh and troubling economy. If you take out the Action and Science Fiction the stuff with the economy and homeless would seem like something out of the news or a realistic documentary. It's that accurate. Instead of using humans,Carpenter uses aliens as the villains who are posing as rich human beings taking over society. Carpenter gives us a dark,eerie,paranoid,apocalyptic view as if the world was falling apart and you don't know who trust and who's human. You say that Carpenter was continuing his themes of paranoia and human beings from The Thing where human beings are paranoid and afraid of the aliens and of each other which are great themes and those same themes work here as well. What I also love about the film is the Humor and satire in this film where television and advertisements have subliminal messages underneath and also mocking the rich and the consumer culture when during the 1980s most people were about getting rich,making a lot of money and living good lives,but They Live turns that idea on it's head and offers a funny and biting satire of the era. Carpenter's commentary and jab at the Reagan era is very much dead on. John Nada is another classic Carpenter Anti-Hero we can relate to because he is down to earth and a human being that keeps his head on his shoulders and keeps his cool when he starts to go after the aliens but is also tough and cool individual that doesn't messing around. They Live is a Western in disguise and John Nada like other Carpenter Antiheros is a modern day Western cowboy instead trying to survive in the Wild West is trying to survive against Aliens in a big city The Action sequences in the film are well done with great shootouts and intensity and has one of the finest,longest,greatest fight scenes in film history. The fight scene is brutal,long and funny and at times you feel like it will go on forever,it's one of the most realistic fight scenes I've ever seen because you can feel those punches and kicks almost like you're in the scene yourself. It's Five great minutes of fighting you'll never forget. Great scene. The film also has one of the greatest lines in film history and will be quoted forever thanks to Roddy Piper. A great line. For a film made on a 4 million dollar budget the special effects are outstanding and at times makes the film look like it cost 40 million. Carpenter is a master at making a low budget film look like 70 million dollar film. The ending of the film is classic and funny and is a wonderful cap off to the film and is one of the things that makes They Live a great movie.Roddy Piper is great as John Nada bringing a cool and calm feel to the role and when Piper gets into the action,Piper says great one liners and kicks ass. No wonder Roddy Piper is one of the best pro wrestlers of all time. The Underrated Keith David is wonderful as Frank,Nada's co-worker and friend,with David bringing the same intensity and depth he brings to a lot of performances. Meg Foster does a fine job as Holly,a person that Nada meets and is trying to tell her what's going on. Carpenter actors George'Buck'Flower(Drifter)and Peter Jason(Gilbert)give great performances as does Raymond St. Jacques(Street Preacher)who is great in his small role. The direction by John Carpenter is brilliant. Carpenter moves the camera slowly and giving the film a great atmosphere especially during the black and white sequences with the aliens. The action scenes by Carpenter excellent and well-done with tightness and great editing. Great job,JohnThe score by Carpenter and Alan Howarth is excellent mixing together Western,Blues and Jazz that perfectly matches the tone of the film. It's probably my favorite Carpenter score.John carpenter's They Live is to put it simply a great and one of Carpenter's best.If you love Sci\/Fi,Action and Cult films I suggest you see this film. Highly Recommended. 10\/10.

Back are all the same characters (except Porky!) but missing are the funny situations and much of the previous film's charm. What we're left with is a heavy-handed story about religious fanatics and the KKK trying to disrupt a Shakespeare festival at the kids' school. There are a few very funny moments, but nothing like we saw the first time around.Bob Clark was also in the midst of making A Christmas Story at the time. In fact the major award from that film can be found in one scene in this film. Maybe he was distracted. Maybe the fact that he shared the writing duties with two other people this time also caused problems. However you slice it, the laughs just aren't there.Our story begins (like the title says) the very next morning after the boys destroyed Porky's nightclub. Curious though how Micky, who was on crutches and had bandages all over his face from a previous visit to the infamous club, now is all healed and looks normal! It's goofs like this that make you wonder why on Earth they needed to have the story continue the very next day. Especially since the story in this film in no way has anything to do with what happened in the previous film. There are other problems we must take a look at....Porky's II seems to have more naked men than women! I cannot recall a mainstream film with more male frontal nudity. And most of it is from old men! It's hard to fathom who the target audience was for this type of material. Some of the pranks the boys commit in this film are just mean-spirited. We all know the female gym teacher Miss Balbricker is a bitch, but sending a snake up the toilet she's sitting on may be going too far. It's more creepy than funny. And how anyone but perhaps an experienced plumber could know exactly what pipe to put the snake into so it would come up through the right toilet is beyond me.The film also suffers from trying to take itself too seriously. Sure the KKK are a bunch of skunks, but taking them on wouldn't seem like a laughing matter. Especially back in the 1950s when this film takes place. You could really get killed for messing around with those guys.There are some nuggets of humor to be found if you dig in the right place, though. There is a hilarious scene in a graveyard where Pee Wee is made a fool of when he thinks he has the upper hand. Seeing what eventually happens to the KKK members is also worth a good chuckle.The film made a nice chunk of change, but nothing like part 1. If you're looking for additional laughs, give Porky's Revenge a try. That film is decidedly less self-righteous, and gives the gang plenty of zany things to get mixed up in. A nice return to the roots of the series, you could say.The 4.0 this film is scoring sounds about right to the Hound. 4 of 10 stars for Porky's II.

And all this time around I was thinking Where did I saw Elizabeth Pena before? and oh, alright that's here, that's got to be her? No way!? I never heard of this film ever but browsing here in IMDb gave me chances to catch a glimpse of never before seen films that got so much of beauty of its area. This is the first film of Tim Robbins I saw, and the much classic and acclaimed Shawshank Redemption has to be him! There are still so much films in line in my list for this man (e.g. Shawshank Redemption, Mystic River, The Arlington Road, The Player, Hudsucker Proxy, The Secret Life of Words and more).Many would say the story of Jacob's Ladder is rather predictable or maybe I'm just new to this area that I didn't grasp what the film truly meant. It was a horror film in the first place, but it was more of a drama side actually. Its quiet terrifying how much of an ordeal one has to go through before accepting death. It's sensible but disturbing. Jacob's horrifying experience had to be a realization, a fight disguised in hideous recollections, repeatedly telling him to let go, make peace of you and accept death. There so much punishment he experienced only to think that everything was for his good. I'm quiet confused why Gabe is uncredited in this film but nevertheless he's the character that waited for Jacob's redemption and peace sit in. This film dramatic side gives me the chills, appreciating the beauty of the character's experiences. But I would not deny the creepy side. That hospital scene could indeed make anyone sick more than ever. The demons were really disturbing, the atmosphere was eerie and I wish I could see the deleted scenes to emphasize more what I missed.

Well I thought it would turn out pretty good, but after watching Risky Business I realized that it's not quite as good of an idea as you would think, at least not in this case. Risky Business stars Tom Cruise as Joel Goodsen, a brainy teen who hopes to go into business one day. But those aspirations are put in jeopardy when his parents go out of town for a week and Joel decides to live a little. He invites a prostitute to his home and, when her charge ends up being more than he thought, Joel can't pay her and she ends up stealing a prized possession of his mother's. Joel then has to track her down, only to find out that her pimp now has what he wants, so Joel must come up with some way to get it back, while also going to school. It's an incredibly strange film where nothing feels natural and the whole plot feels forced. It's not what you'd expect which, in this case, isn't a good thing.What director Paul Brickman is trying to accomplish here is giving a dream like surrealist quality to a teen comedy through the music and camera angles. I'll admit it's an interesting idea and I commend Brickman on his bravery to do something different with a genre we all thought we knew like the back of our hands. Unfortunately, the result of this bravery was a failure. Rather than creating something fascinatingly unique, the style of this film comes off as shallow and pretentious. It tries to hard as it crams its seemingly acute sense of style down our throats. The idea gets old quick and it makes for an obnoxious film that has no sincereness to it and only feels like someone trying to hard.One of the biggest elements employed to achieve the film's surrealism is subduing all the characters to a highly unnatural and almost catatonic state of interaction with one another. Given the urgency of the situation the characters find themselves in you would think the reactions would be a little more concerned and a little more hasty. Instead, we find Tom Cruise having breakfast and being friends with the girl who might have just ruined his entire future. It makes no sense and there are many moments of forced interaction that destroy an otherwise creative storyline.Simply put, Risky Business is just an awful film. It really tried hard to do something different, but it went overboard and made a totally unbelievable and lifeless film. The unrelenting style just beats you over the head, the characters are soulless, the music is weird, and the film just sucks. Given the thought that went into the film before it was made, I would say that it could have been very good. Sadly, it falls as flat as is possibly could.

It's strange, but somehow you instantly feel that _Sleepless in Seattle_ is an irreligious movie; it's not that it would be *against religion*, but you get the definite feeling right from the start that love in its religious dimension is and will remain conspicuously absent from the movie. This is all the more remarkable in that _Sleepless in Seattle_ glorifies and uses motives from the 1957 Cary Grant & Deborah Kerr hit, _An Affair to Remember_ -- a romantic comedy as well, but where religion and religious feelings are as obviously present as they are non-existent in _Sleepless in Seattle_.I believe in none of those things such as destiny, soul mates, being made for one another, you're the only one, etc. And I'm sorry, but as the movie kept reiterating these motives ad nauseam (especially in many of the intentionally old-fashioned songs -- both original and fake new ones written in the old vein, frequently featuring awful, annoyingly maudlin lyrics -- that we get to listen to throughout the movie, from the opening to the closing credits), I just *had* to say to myself All this 'destingy stuff' is something typically enjoyed and believed by women. There's nothing wrong with a movie or book that makes it obvious that its author is a woman; however, this seemed to be *too* obvious in _Sleepless in Seattle_, detracting from the overall enjoyment.

Both movies feature wildly improbable, unrealistic story-lines; yet when you come to think of it, Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr might meet on a luxury ship in 2012 just as they did back in 1957; it would no longer be a transatlantic voyage today, but a pleasurable cruise. Could, however, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan interact, today, in the same way as shown in _Sleepless in Seattle_? Nope. This movie fairly screams at you Where's the Internet? Where are the mobile phones, emails, and social networks? Only a few years later, and the movie's plot would be rendered unusable. Even as it is, great effort is required to suspend your disbelief; while _An Affair to Remember_ is unrealistic, _Sleepless in Seattle_ is doubly so. Or can anyone honestly believe that a loving father would not have alerted the police immediately upon learning that his 8-year-old son eloped on a transcontinental flight to New York unsupervised? Despite all these shortcomings, _Sleepless in Seattle_ manages to be enjoyable throughout, and unlike _An Affair to Remember_, I believe this movie gets better and better with every passing minute. I found the ending of _An Affair to Remember_ rather a let-down, but not here; I thought the Empire State Building finale of _Sleepless in Seattle_ was very nicely constructed, and genuinely moving.I'd say the main credit for the movie's success should go to the two leading stars. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan both give brilliant, flawless performances. They seem thoroughly believable as persons or personalities, even while their actions do not. The two child actors, Ross Malinger and Gaby Hoffmann, are terrific as well.

This is what made him such a legendary director and set him apart from everyone else.I first watched this film about 10 years ago and I couldn't believe the special effects. I can't imagine what people thought of it when it first came out. I'm sure a lot of people didn't know what to think about it at first. The first third of the movie has no dialogue and the last third is basically an acid trip sequence with no dialogue as well. It's very different than anything you've seen but if you have the right mind set, it will blow your mind.The acting is very good, but the movie relies heavily on everything else. The plot is not explained very well but the open ended questions are what makes it so mysterious and mind boggling. You see what happens and your questions aren't fully answered but your imagination fills in the blanks and in my opinion that's the best way to do it.It starts out at the dawn of man, when we were all just ape-like creatures waiting to evolve. The group of apes (let's call them) that we see are suddenly looking upon a giant, rectangle monolith that appeared out of nowhere. When the apes touch the monolith their minds are opened up to a new stage in evolution, the use of tools.

Bank robbers and lovers of the limelight &#x97; as well as sometimes each other &#x97; their story has everything you could want in a film suspense, action, humor, drama and romance. Bonnie and Clyde hits all those notes.The package director Arthur Penn (The Miracle Worker) puts together could be a lot neater, but he captures the iconicity of these two tabloid heroes, in large part thanks to stars Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty. They both exemplify the uninhibited joie de vivre of their characters, who seem to fear nothing, go out of their way to give the press something new to write about and speak off hand about when they're caught or killed.Unfortunately, only the beginning of the film, when Bonnie and Clyde meet and head off together, focuses purely on their relationship. During the bulk of the film, the other supporting characters\/members of the Barrow Gang have to be pushed to the side for it to be about the titular couple. We know how they feel about each other, but we don't feel permanently strapped in to the roller coaster of their relationship.The inclusion of Buck and Blanche Barrow (Gene Hackman and Estelle Parsons) as well as C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard) certainly make Bonnie and Clyde feel more like an adventure. They bring a certain levity that enhances how care-free they all lived despite constantly having local forces bearing down on them whenever they gave away a small clue of their presence in a certain town.Then there's Blanche, a role that won Parsons an Oscar. Therefore, Blanche is one of the most irritating and unlikable characters (who's not a bad guy) to ever garner an Oscar. She's family, being Buck's wife, so they must keep her around, though she's self-centered and a complete liability. You wish they'd just throw her out of one of the dozens of cars they steal and drive around in throughout the film, but she sticks around to the audience's chagrin.This large middle chunk of the film featuring the Barrow Gang plays out as a collection of moments from their travels, almost all of which lead to the next time the police will find them, resulting in a gunfight and them fleeing town. These scenes are memorable and build the characters up in entertaining fashion, giving you a sense of just how reckless and fueled by danger they all really were. At the same time, that builds up more of the folk perception of the Barrow Gang rather than capturing who these people were and what drove them to behave that way.Dunaway and Beatty do give us a greater depth of character with their performances when the film allows for a focus on their relationship. We get a very good sense of what attracts each to the other and for Bonnie, a very good idea of what drove her to throw her life away for Clyde Barrow and his anything-but-normal lifestyle. Dunaway embodies everything the script says or suggests about Bonnie Parker. She has a definite beauty and manner suggestive of a woman who knows what power she wields, but there's a naivety to most of her decisions and reactions. Obviously as the film continues she sheds more of the latter for the former.Beatty also demonstrates the dual nature of Clyde, who comes off as so self-assured and in control, yet he harbors some insecurities and is almost team-oriented and selfless to a fault.The one weakness of the script other than limiting the depth with which it explores our main characters is a sense of scope. As to the fame of Bonnie and Clyde and the Barrow Gang's exploits, we are asked to take the film's word for it rather than truly see how they've become a tabloid favorite. We also don't get to see the cat in this cat and mouse relationship between the gang and the authorities. Most films will have part of the story focus on the person\/people trying to bring the crooks down, but that person doesn't emerge until very late in the gang. We have trouble understanding what motivates them to take the Barrow Gang down, and so violently too.Bonnie and Clyde also doesn't have much to say, but ultimately, that's okay. It leaves us with is a portrait of who these people were, giving us the opportunity to decide how we feel about them. Was their end tragic? Heart-breaking? A long time coming? Unfair? It's all there for us to pick through, but the unquestionable truth is how fascinating their legend is.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Bank robbers and lovers of the limelight &#x97; as well as sometimes each other &#x97; their story has everything you could want in a film suspense, action, humor, drama and romance. Bonnie and Clyde hits all those notes.The package director Arthur Penn (The Miracle Worker) puts together could be a lot neater, but he captures the iconicity of these two tabloid heroes, in large part thanks to stars Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty. They both exemplify the uninhibited joie de vivre of their characters, who seem to fear nothing, go out of their way to give the press something new to write about and speak off hand about when they're caught or killed.Unfortunately, only the beginning of the film, when Bonnie and Clyde meet and head off together, focuses purely on their relationship. During the bulk of the film, the other supporting characters\/members of the Barrow Gang have to be pushed to the side for it to be about the titular couple. We know how they feel about each other, but we don't feel permanently strapped in to the roller coaster of their relationship.The inclusion of Buck and Blanche Barrow (Gene Hackman and Estelle Parsons) as well as C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard) certainly make Bonnie and Clyde feel more like an adventure. They bring a certain levity that enhances how care-free they all lived despite constantly having local forces bearing down on them whenever they gave away a small clue of their presence in a certain town.Then there's Blanche, a role that won Parsons an Oscar. Therefore, Blanche is one of the most irritating and unlikable characters (who's not a bad guy) to ever garner an Oscar.

The requisite underwater terrain alone is a perfect medium for textured dimensional rendering, and the idea of a terrifying, relentless killing machine swimming off-screen into audiences' laps is inherently awesome in and of itself. Sadly, this uneven offering never takes full advantage of its technology or its subject matter, and while it's nowhere near as bad as the truly abysmal Jaws The Revenge (few things are), it's also nowhere near as good as the flawless original or the excellent and unfairly dismissed follow-up.Even without its potentially interesting visual ploy, Jaws 3-D has all of the ingredients to be a great sequel on paper a stellar cast, a fresh concept, and, of course, a toothy behemoth that had already generated some of the scariest moments in screen history. These assets are ultimately squandered however. The seasoned ensemble is given very little to do, so the character studies at the heart of Jaws and Jaws 2 are bypassed entirely. The Sea World setting is woefully underused, and instead of giving our beast a novel killing ground, the park mostly functions as merely another mass of water for the action to unfold in. Worse, the shark itself isn't ever used in a suspenseful fashion, and the handful of deaths attributed to the monster are blatantly telegraphed and largely ineffective.Like many 3-D films that are stripped of their visual device for the home market, this one contains multiple scenes that may have been fun to behold on theater screens, but become utterly silly here. Floating fish heads and severed limbs bobbing with the tide might have provided cheap thrills for the opening weekend audience, but in a flat DVD representation, they simply function as camera shots that linger for far too long.The shark effects range from serviceable to downright awful, and since footage of actual sharks is utilized rather extensively, the titular titan more clearly resembles a synthetic puppet when we're seeing it at work. A couple of scenes of the creature slamming into gates and boats seem to have been created by using a plastic mock-up instead the sophisticated robotic construct that populated the first two Jaws outings, and since little effort is made to sell these moments, you can actually see the rubber shark bounce off its targets upon collision. When these flashes are integrated alongside the graceful maneuvering of real great whites, there is little symmetry between the two versions and the complete suspension of disbelief required to make a scenario like this pay off is rarely achieved.Apart from its obviousness as a prop, the shark in Jaws 3-D just isn't all that frightening because the meager body count doesn't allow it to prove itself as an insatiable murder machine. A couple of random victims are thrown in early on, but when the shark finally makes its way into the water park, where a virtual smörgåsbord of flailing legs awaits, every single person the shark pursues easily escapes its titular Jaws. Only one of the major characters gets bit during this extended sequence, and she gets away with little more than a few scratches on her leg.There are a few solid jump scares peppered throughout the film, but while the tension seems to be mounting every step of the way, the movie invariably pulls back before anything all that spectacular or horrifying occurs. Even the promising climax goes flaccid when the absolute dumbest false 3-D moment occurs, and any menace our finned antagonist has generated along the way is readily diffused by a protracted shot of her slowly floating toward the camera and breaking through a plainly animated sheet of glass. The way the shark is dispatched is particularly hard to swallow (this is actually a pretty good pun if you've seen the film), and yet another silly extended in your face moment caps off a tremendously underwhelming resolution.Savvy collectors will easily be able to track down readily available bootleg DVDs that retain the original 3-D presentation, but even the cleanest transfer available on the secondary market is still high-generation and extremely murky, a state which naturally strips away the potency of the visual effects. Watching my copy gave me a headache, and I had to stop about every thirty minutes or so to take off the glasses and give my eyes a rest. I eventually made it through, but when I did, all I discovered was that Jaws 3-D isn't much more impressive in its original form. The obsessive collector in me knows that if this offering ever gets a proper Blu-Ray release I will have to add it to my collection and give the film at least one more go, but the realist in me is guessing that even digitized 3-D effects won't make up for the numerous other weaknesses on hand here.There are a few effective moments here that will hold the attention of admirers of the series, but the film as a whole is a missed opportunity that can only be rightfully recommended to the most forgiving killer fish fans. An even better recommendation for those who have digested every frame of the unmatchable original and simply must have more is to skip this one entirely and give Jaws 2 another look instead.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"28 June 2012","score":"","review":" I have always admired the unusual way, in which Tim Burton is able to communicate his opinion on old-as-our-world topics. In Edward Scissorhands he confronts the viewer with the constantly recurring problem of personal alienation and rejection from the society, because of differences that might seem too hard to comprehend or actually too scary for most of the 'normal' people.In the deeply satirical, and highly unconventional manner Burton tries to persuade everyone that good heart and pure kindness won't be enough to be accepted, and that it sometimes takes less than a few minutes to change the way others perceive us. The extraordinary often tends to bore people after a while and they simply throw out human beings like trash bags when they don't need them anymore.With fantastic special effects and spectacular optical illusions Edward Scissorhands is able to astound in the sphere of visual experiences. However, due to some flaws in the storytelling department it is still not such a fine piece of work like Beetlejuice or Batman.In a strangely artificial world, where all houses are painted in high-contrast pastel colors, and people wear deliciously ugly and glaring uniforms, there is also a place for a gloomy 'haunted' house standing on a hill. The only person that occupies it is a boy named Edward. Because of the death of his creator, a mad scientist (Vincent Price), he is left with pairs of huge temporary scissors instead of hands. Ono one shiny day one of the loony housewives, Peg (Dianne West), who lives in the city with her husband, son and daughter, comes knocking on his door, and after just a few moments she decides to take him home. In a community, where everybody is nearly as weird as Edward is, people don't find him strange or frightening. What's more, they are truly amazed by his fantastic abilities, namely the special gift of forming beautiful figures in bushes and ice blocks, and turning regular haircutting into an art form. He is glorified by the local news channels and loved by all the creepy ladies. He is the talk of the town, a one of a kind 'toy' that brings so much fun into this bizarre scenery. There is even some place for romance between him and Kim (Winona Ryder), the family's daughter. However, as it always happens, there are some people who don't appreciate an eccentric man with scissors as his fingers running around posing as a proper citizen. Soon, after a series of unlucky events, Edward is wrongly accused of breaking into a house and all of the fame and love starts to fade away as quickly as it came. And even though what happens next to Edward is truly sad and unfair, the ending is merely as predictable and Hollywood-like.

The extraordinary often tends to bore people after a while and they simply throw out human beings like trash bags when they don't need them anymore.With fantastic special effects and spectacular optical illusions Edward Scissorhands is able to astound in the sphere of visual experiences. However, due to some flaws in the storytelling department it is still not such a fine piece of work like Beetlejuice or Batman.In a strangely artificial world, where all houses are painted in high-contrast pastel colors, and people wear deliciously ugly and glaring uniforms, there is also a place for a gloomy 'haunted' house standing on a hill. The only person that occupies it is a boy named Edward. Because of the death of his creator, a mad scientist (Vincent Price), he is left with pairs of huge temporary scissors instead of hands.

In a community, where everybody is nearly as weird as Edward is, people don't find him strange or frightening. What's more, they are truly amazed by his fantastic abilities, namely the special gift of forming beautiful figures in bushes and ice blocks, and turning regular haircutting into an art form. He is glorified by the local news channels and loved by all the creepy ladies. He is the talk of the town, a one of a kind 'toy' that brings so much fun into this bizarre scenery. There is even some place for romance between him and Kim (Winona Ryder), the family's daughter. However, as it always happens, there are some people who don't appreciate an eccentric man with scissors as his fingers running around posing as a proper citizen. Soon, after a series of unlucky events, Edward is wrongly accused of breaking into a house and all of the fame and love starts to fade away as quickly as it came. And even though what happens next to Edward is truly sad and unfair, the ending is merely as predictable and Hollywood-like.

Smilla appears initially to be well blended into the workplace and life of the city but soon we realize that she is not a city person; she has grown up in the vast and snow-covered plains of Greenland with her Inuit mother and moved to Copenhagen after her mother's death.Smilla one day after returning from work witnesses the fatal fall of a young Inuit boy falling from a terrace. The police arrives just after her and question her about the event. Despite being in a state of shock she manages to look at the scene and from the footprints on the snow she believes that the death was not accidental the boy was pushed or nudged to jump under a threat. From that day on Smilla's life will change. She is determined to find out the truth seeking initially help from her father (who prepares to marry again) and then from her neighbor, the enigmatic mechanic played by (the always good) Gabriel Byrne.'Smilla's sense of snow' is a very good thriller and Smilla is a very interesting heroine. We understand from the beginning that she does not feel comfortable in the city but at the same time tries to integrate without losing her Inuit identity. She seems fragile but her 'sense of snow' guides her to find the killer and her new identity. For her the death of the Inuit boy (that we get to know through a number of flashbacks) appears to signify the loss of her own innocence in a new world of norms and rules that she does not feel comfortable to abide by. The film is a well-crafted thriller from a good director (Bille August) with beautiful images of Copenhagen and the Arctic. A 8\/10 from me.

There something about the idea of the story thats so appealing. Most stories about WWII are about battles. However, the two greatest movies about WWII, Casablanca and Empire of the Sun, go deeper into the personal trails of characters during a time when emotions and feelings were supposed to be on the back burner. The main character in this film is superb in showing what patriotism is all about. Hes English but has never been there and understands the Chinese (where he lives and grew up) better than his own people. Its a tale of the War that slipped through the cracks and never got told, the English that were trapped in China during WWII. I can see how this can be a little dry for some viewers but if you understand that this is a character study versus an action film it is a little easier to enjoy. Also, its strongly based on a true story with events that are spot on accurate. It is in my humble opinion the greatest coming of age movie ever made. Besides, when the producers of this movie are Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall, Kathleen Kennedy and Robert Shapiro its a little hard to think this movie is a miss. I don't think there is another movie in Hollywood that has ever had that powerful assembly of Producers, ever.

I've not seen the remake, but I've seen the box office figures and they're not pretty. It barely made 1\/3 of what it cost to make! Yikes! The original, after years of availability on the small screen, has actually become a marginal success. It is a typical disaster flick full of stereotypical characters and situations, but there's no doubting the film's star power and intentions. Gene Hackman's performance almost saves the film.The plot involves a luxurious ocean liner (The Poseidon) which is turned upside down by a large rogue wave. Most of the passengers and crew perish while a crafty young minister (Hackman) leads a small band of survivors up through the bottom of the ship and hopefully to the chance at a rescue. Making their way through the over-turned ship is difficult enough, but it proves just as difficult for the young preacher to keep everyone's spirits up and convince them to keep following him toward the engine room in the midst of one hardship after another. The film becomes a testament to not giving up in the face of tough odds and the loss of loved ones. The film, through Hackman's character, is simply reminding the audience to keep the faith.Though the f\/x of the 1970s were nothing like what we have today, the film looks decent enough. The upside-down sets look like they were a chore to design, but they appear detailed. Nothing really looks completely hokey or cheap. It looks like this would have been a physically taxing shoot for all of the actors involved.Problems arise from the script, however. The tone of the film once the ship is turned over is wildly inconsistent. One moment will have characters tenderly encouraging each other that life is still worth living. The next moment will feature cast members shouting at one another in furious fits of over-acting. All this while the water level and possibility of death is rising higher and higher. Cast members die off in a mostly predictable order. When it's all said and done, Hackman's performance and some neat sets are really all this film can hang its hat on. One wonders why anyone thought to spend so much money remaking this film.5 of 10 stars.
