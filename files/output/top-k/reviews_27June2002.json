The viewer walks out undisturbed and unchallenged, because they know that the good guys will win... Why couldnt he have given alittle less sunny picture of the future, and reminded the viewer why we should guard against a policy such as pre-crime? Instead no one is really hurt from pre-crime, all is resolved in the end...... I mean WTF? I guess going over board to prevent terrorism is okay, because we'll wake up and realize a super strict policy against possible suspects isnt a good idea, and no one will really be hurt....Well anyway, the storyline is so weak, and predictable they have to make the Fed look super evil. I mean they dont want us thinking he may be a normal person.. I mean normal people dont do bad things right....Despite all this my main problem was that the characters werent really likeable, I think the writing was probably at fault here. The characters werent really life like, they didnt have distint personalities, or atleast we didnt get to see enough to become emotionally involved. Tom Cruise's character is only person we get to know abit about, and I really didnt feel all that much for him either.Well I didnt hate this film, but I was more upset that a story with some meaning was completely ruined by poor writing and bad directing.Well screw this movie, I'm going to go see Insomnia and About a Boy again.

Now, Halle Berry's performance is great, but did she deserve an Oscar?  Not exactly.  I found Sissy Spacek's performance in In the Bedroom to be more subtle and powerful.  But I still have to give Halle lots of credit.  Her not deserving an Oscar is no way slanderous towards her--winning an Oscar is not about being great, it's being the best.  However, Billy Bob Thornton deserved at least a nomination.  His performance has so many subtle nuances that I'm surprised the Academy didn't even seem to consider him.  I found his performance to be more powerful than Halle's, but that's just my opinion.  Peter Boyle is on my list of the best underrated actors, and he totally immerses himself into the character of Billy Bob's racist father.  I was also very impressed by Heath Ledger as Billy's neglected son.  His Southern accent is perfect and I really got a sense of his pain, despite the fact that he's only in a few scenes.  Heath came a long way since 10 Things I Hate About You.  He also deserved an Oscar nomination.  And rapper Mos Def gives a fine, natural performance and I can tell he got into his character, unlike other rapper-turned-actors...and I will now segue into Sean P. Diddy Combs' performance.  In a word  miscast.  Sean proved he didn't have the acting chops in Jon Favreau's Made and he proves it yet again.  Why the director decided to cast him, among an array of talented actors--I do not know.  He could've cast a Don Cheadle or Denzel Washington, but he decided to go with Sean Don't-Quit-Your-Day-Job Combs.  He has the intensity of a piece of cardboard, and that was a bad move, being that he was about to get executed, and you want the audience to feel sympathy for the man being executed.  I appreciated the subtleties of this film, but at times it's just too low-key for its own good.  I wasn't as riveted as I expected to be.  I guess the characters could've been more well-defined.  We get a great idea of how Billy Bob's character is like, but I think the others could've been more developed more and I wanted to get a better feeling of the relationships involving the supporting characters, aside from the one between Billy Bob and his son which I felt was defined well in a few intimate scenes.  I wanted to get a little more insight into Peter Boyle's character, and why he was a racist.  ***********POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD**********There were a few scenes I found very effective.  One was the final argument between Billy Bob and his son.  And when the son ends up killing himself, it completely took me by surprise.  It wasn't one of those operatic death scenes you often see in films; it had a great sense of realism.  Another scene was the one in which Halle Berry and Peter Boyle first meet.  You can feel the tension between them, yet he insults her in a subconscious way.  In a more heavy-handed film, he--being a racist--would've called her by the n word repeatedly and asked her the get the hell out of his house.  Instead, he asks her for a cigarette and talks about how he used to have a thing for black women (though those aren't his exact words).  The only scene I felt was over-the-top was the sex scene.  I know when filmmakers shoot a sex scene, they always come up with a detailed argument as to why it is crucial to the asthetics of the film, but every time I see an explicit sex scene like this I keep thinking back to that scene from Witness in which Harrison Ford stares across the room at Kelly McGillis, who's sponge-bathing herself.  You can just feel the eroticism between the 2 characters, without them even laying a finger on each other.  And when we cut to the next day, you know exactly what happened between them the other night.  In Monster's Ball we see Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton screwing each other in every possible sexual position.  I'm not being hypocritical.  Seeing Halle Berry naked is never an unpleasant sight.  I just felt it didn't belong in the film.  I can't regard Monster's Ball as anything close to a bad film, but don't go into watching this movie assuming it's gonna be one of the best films of the year.  Maybe it just depends on your point of view.  Experiencing a film is a subjective process, and some films just happen to have a better impact on some than others.

I could not have been more wrong.  Sometimes when you watch a movie you're disappointed because your expectations are too high, or because you're just not in the right mood to appreciate that sort of film.  Those excuses don't apply here though, because I was in the mood for a lighthearted comedy, and my only expectation was that it should be funny.This movie should never have been released.  It's the most unfunny rubbish I've ever seen, and an incredible waste of a talented cast; John Cleese, Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg just to mention three actors that probably wake up every night in a cold sweat wishing they'd never agreed to be in this trash.The plot, such as it is, is this  A wealthy Las Vegas casino owner (played by John Cleese) comes up with a scheme to entertain his high-rollers.  He places six special tokens in his slot machines, then gathers the six winners together in one room and tells them he's sending them on a race to recover $2 million dollars which is stored in a locker in the train station of some remote little town.  The only rule, he tells them, is that there are no rules.  The first person there wins the money.  It's actually a decent premise for a movie like this, along the same lines as Cannonball Run.Unfortunately, the script feels like it was put together by a bunch of 10 year old boys locked in a room and fed red cordial and speed until they went spastic.  I certainly don't mind unusual, absurd or unrealistic situations in a comedy, but that's not the problem here.  The problem is that the director has relied on slapstick and visual gags, and has telegraphed the punchline of almost every single joke.  It was so predictable and banal in its stupidity that I was literally uttering the characters next lines in advance during some parts of the movie.There were a few funny moments.  Cleese's character and his high-rolling gamblers will bet on anything, and the setups for their wagers were generally funny.  There were one or two other gags that I laughed at, but so often a funny moment was spoilt by dragging it out far too long, or setting it up so transparently that you were over it by the time it arrived.I wanted to turn it off, but I was hoping desperately that it would improve. Instead it got steadily worse as the film progressed, until it all culminated in the most sickly sweet and preachy ending I've seen in years.

Part of this is due to the horrible, wooden dialogue that has plagued the first 2 of this new series, but it just seems that the level of creativity and intelligence that went into creating the original cast is completely gone.In the original trilogy, the duo of Han Solo and Chewbacca gave the original trilogy an energy and warmth that lacks in the new installments.  Another great duo, C-3PO and R2D2 provided their own blend of comedy and just plain innovation as far as their costume design, which was something never seen before.  No one has been able to reproduce another Darth Vader, which the incredible voice, the brilliant costume design, and the sheer mystery and awe he gave off.Attack of the Clones features some really good Hollywood talent in Hayden, Natalie, Ewan, Christopher Lee, Samuel Jackson, etc, but the chemistry and the magic just doesn't exist in the film.  Their characters have no edge, no individual style, nothing that sets them apart from anything people have seen before.  There really is no one to root for, no one you really can cheer for, other than the computer animated Yoda.The characters of the original trilogy were so fun to watch because your initial reaction was something like, jeez, how did they come up with this stuff???  In the new installments, the best that Lucas's team can come up with is Jar Jar Binks and a bunch of bizarre, forgettable computer-animated creatures.Even worse, Lucas's team relies too much on the originals. I am baffled as to why this Jango Fett was created.  I understand that the Lucas team wanted to explain how the Clones and the so-called Clone Wars began, but why do a total RIP OFF of the Boba Fett character from the originals?  Boba Fett was another brilliant design by the original team, his high-powered battle suit was just awesome and frightening, but his role was a small one in the scheme of things, and nothing more was alluded to.  Along with the Boba Fett rip-off, why bring back C-3PO and R2D2?  Again, the Lucas team is just lazy, un-inspired, or completely stupid in their choice to introduce these characters.  In such an amazing, vast universe, how could this story revolve around a small group of characters?  In my opinion, there may be two reasons for this.  One, Jango Fett and the droids make for really great toys, and the people who profit from Lucas must absolutely drool when they think of the new line of Jango Fett toys that will hit shelves soon.  Second, I think the new Lucas team are either not as talented as the original artists (who were absolute GENUISES), or they are afraid of taking risks and making the effort of creating a whole new universe for people to enjoy.  Maybe Lucas was scared of trying something new, so his team decided to ride on the magic of the original trilogy.  Nevertheless, the creativity is gone, replaced by computer animation, very pretty on the surface, but very shallow indeed.There is one more thing that has been bothering me.  The design of the stormtroopers is obviously somewhat different from that of the orginal soldiers, as the helmets are different, they seem to be more related to Jango Fett.  But I also noticed that the design of the Star Destroyers,  which also appear near the end of the film, seem somewhat different than in the original trilogy.  Is this intended as an early design that will be changed later by the Empire?  Or is this Lucas's new interpretation of what the Empire should have looked like?  I was a little confused on that matter.I gave the film a 6 out of 10.

Along with the Boba Fett rip-off, why bring back C-3PO and R2D2?  Again, the Lucas team is just lazy, un-inspired, or completely stupid in their choice to introduce these characters.  In such an amazing, vast universe, how could this story revolve around a small group of characters?  In my opinion, there may be two reasons for this.  One, Jango Fett and the droids make for really great toys, and the people who profit from Lucas must absolutely drool when they think of the new line of Jango Fett toys that will hit shelves soon.  Second, I think the new Lucas team are either not as talented as the original artists (who were absolute GENUISES), or they are afraid of taking risks and making the effort of creating a whole new universe for people to enjoy.  Maybe Lucas was scared of trying something new, so his team decided to ride on the magic of the original trilogy.  Nevertheless, the creativity is gone, replaced by computer animation, very pretty on the surface, but very shallow indeed.There is one more thing that has been bothering me.  The design of the stormtroopers is obviously somewhat different from that of the orginal soldiers, as the helmets are different, they seem to be more related to Jango Fett.  But I also noticed that the design of the Star Destroyers,  which also appear near the end of the film, seem somewhat different than in the original trilogy.  Is this intended as an early design that will be changed later by the Empire?  Or is this Lucas's new interpretation of what the Empire should have looked like?  I was a little confused on that matter.I gave the film a 6 out of 10.

Part of this is due to the horrible, wooden dialogue that has plagued the first 2 of this new series, but it just seems that the level of creativity and intelligence that went into creating the original cast is completely gone.In the original trilogy, the duo of Han Solo and Chewbacca gave the original trilogy an energy and warmth that lacks in the new installments.  Another great duo, C-3PO and R2D2 provided their own blend of comedy and just plain innovation as far as their costume design, which was something never seen before.  No one has been able to reproduce another Darth Vader, which the incredible voice, the brilliant costume design, and the sheer mystery and awe he gave off.Attack of the Clones features some really good Hollywood talent in Hayden, Natalie, Ewan, Christopher Lee, Samuel Jackson, etc, but the chemistry and the magic just doesn't exist in the film.  Their characters have no edge, no individual style, nothing that sets them apart from anything people have seen before.  There really is no one to root for, no one you really can cheer for, other than the computer animated Yoda.The characters of the original trilogy were so fun to watch because your initial reaction was something like, jeez, how did they come up with this stuff???  In the new installments, the best that Lucas's team can come up with is Jar Jar Binks and a bunch of bizarre, forgettable computer-animated creatures.Even worse, Lucas's team relies too much on the originals. I am baffled as to why this Jango Fett was created.

What's great about the movie is that it's a musical, and a good one at that. I have most of the songs on my computer, and while they're very short (most don't run over two minutes in length), most do a good job of riffing 'real' musicals. If you know anything about Disney, then you'd catch the little references to Beauty & the Beast in the opening Mountain Town song, and Satan's Up There ballad reminded me of Part of Your World from The Little Mermaid. Some of the songs are great just by themselves, like the Oscar-nominated (I kid you not) Blame Canada or the swear-ridden It's Easy MMMkay. The story's pretty silly (something about Armageddon coming to pass if Terrance & Phillip are executed), but it's only there to set up the constant jokes, riffs, and gags. It's hard coming up with my favorite moment, but I especially liked when the Mole grabbed one of the kids and said something like, What do you think this is, some kind of Saturday kiddie show where we all sit around and lick Barney's big purple pussy? He cursed God a minute later, calling him a bitch, and that probably falls in at second place. If you like the show, then you will absoultely be floored by the movie. 4 out of 4 stars!

Scream 3 was a great way to end a trilogy, especially during a time when trilogies in the horror\/slasher genre or almost non-existence.

Yes, it's slow.  But that's kind of the point. It's a deliberate murder mystery that's not really about the murder at all.  It's a deconstruction of class, and how people have to live within the rigid structure of the British Class system between the World Wars.  And it's not just lower and upper classes.

It made over 200 million bucks and there's no reason to not make more money, right?  He's right.  There is no point in not making a sequel to a great movie.  Just better make sure that you don't make a horrible sequel to a great movie (like Grease's pathetic sequel).  Trust me, he didn't.  Oh, he definitely didn't. Here's my reviewThe movie is excellent.  Perfect.  It's no Coming to America or Training Day but it is definitely awesome.  The movie is basically what you see in the trailer.  Agent J (Will Smith) is doing his work as a top secret agent and making sure no one learns about aliens.  K, on the other hand, is a postal worker.  Yep, a postal worker.  There just happens to be an evil alien (Lara Flynn Boyle) who needs something before the world will be seriously screwed. One problem.  K knows where that is.  It is J's job to locate K, deneuralize him, and rid the world of the scum of the universe... again. They reprise the role of Z, played by Rip Torn.  They also have a few new characters, T and Rita.  It is a great movie.  Sure, the trailer gave away some good jokes but they have enough more to please us all.The acting...what do you think.  An Academy Award winner, an Academy award nominee, two VERY sexy ladies, and talking worms.  Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are excellent as always.  They brought a little more to there characters and worked there jokes perfectly.  Lara Flynn Boyle is one of the sexy ladies and was awesome as the villain.  I can't choose if she or Vincent D'Onforio was better.  The other sexy lady is Rosario Dawson who was very good here.  Patrick Warburton was there for a little while and his character was good.  The worms.  I liked them as much as I like hemorrhoids. Enough said.  I don't loath of them as much of Jar Jar Binks but I still didn't like their presence.  The found a few chuckles out of me but not enough.  The dog was pretty good here.  I think his name was Frank.Overall the movie is definitely awesome and VERY recommended.  Another summer blockbuster.  Rating VERY BIG 10 out of 10.

I'm sure the style of animation in Yellow Submarine has been commented on before, but I thought I'd throw my two bits in before moving on to the important stuff.  First of all, even Disney's films had started to become cheaply animated and less than creative.  Secondly, non-Disney animation seemed to be more interested in Pop art style than Disney's realistic style or even the wacky Looney Tunes gags.  Just look at what came out within the next couple years--A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969), Fritz the Cat (1972), and Heavy Traffic (1973).  Now, I'm not particularly knowledgeable about pop art nor am I a really big fan of it, but there's no denying that Yellow Submarine and these other films brought a freshness to animation.  Some of the sequences are absolutely amazing, even in this age of computer animation (Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Nowhere Man, and Only a Northern Song being my favorites).I like the Beatles, and Yellow Submarine includes some of my favorite songs (Yellow Submarine not being one of those).  However, for those who don't like the Beatles, this movie could very well be a chore.  Even I don't buy into the theme of the movie (which is pretty much expressed in the song, All you Need is Love), which allows for the happy ending (which, in my opinion, isn't a whole lot more convincing than a Care Bears movie).
