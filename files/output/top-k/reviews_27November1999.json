After digesting this movie for a while, I am still not quite sure what to make of it and more importantly, what exactly is it about.  On the surface The Limey seems like a straightforward geriatric Deathwish with its theme of revenge.  Go deeper and it is more a character study of a man who has devoted his entire being to a life of crime and dealing with a culture that he is not entirely familiar with. Look sideways and it deals with hard core men who are over-the-hill attempting to hang on to their lost youth and vitality by being tough (even though their bodies can't quite cut it anymore), wearing expensive designer suits with tinted glasses and having very young beautiful women by their side.  Whatever the case may be director Steven Soderbergh, of the very sexy and stylish but much more superior Out of Sight with George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez, knows who to handle the crime drama\/thriller with panache and style like no one else.Dave Wilson (the very good Terrence Stamp), a smart, intense criminal just released from prison heads to LA from London to look into the somewhat mysterious death of his daughter, who he barely knew.  He believes she died at the hands of her boyfriend, legendary and majorly rich record producer Terry Valentine (Peter Fonda) and will not stop until he tracks him down for answers.The plot here of avenging father seems pretty much lame and not that interesting or complicated at all, but maybe that is the point, not everything in life is extraordinary, in fact much of life is standard, simple and uneventful.  But the plot does not so much drive this movie as do the characters.  In a world of 16-year-old superstar models, actors and singers, it is totally refreshing to see a movie where the majority of characters are over 40, many over the sixty mark.  Even the hitmen of this movie are past their prime.  These criminal characters are not your typical stock characters of most crime films, some are regular Joes who happen to have chosen crime as their career aspirations and deal with the same problems as the typical 9 to 5 office worker.  As the one hitman hired by Valentine's head security Avery (Barry Newman) says, I embrace my lifestyle.While the acting is top notch, especially Stamp, Fonda and Newman, the real star of the film is director, Soderbergh and especially cinematographer Ed Lachman.  Soderbergh cuts so many different scenes back and forth with a flair that I have not experienced yet as with a character speaking in one scene and finishing the sentence in another.  His use of flashbacks of a young Terrence Stamp incorporating Stamp's 1967 film, Poor Cow, are not only genius but a great homage to the actor. Also when we first meet the Fonda character, the background music has lyrics that include easy rider is a curse.  Just great. He also seems to get amazing performances from his actors as he did with Clooney and Lopez in last years  Out of Sight. Fonda still riding high from 1997's  Ulee's Gold does well with the character of Valentine, showing a very vulnerable, insecure and weak man who hides behind wealth and power.  Stamp delivers an intense and powerful, yet totally focused, subtle and real performance that is very rare in this film genre. It is a memorable performance and character.  Cinematographer, Lachman, does an amazing job with shots that are standard fare, but gives them a different angel that make them stand out such as a scene where Wilson tosses one of Valentine's body guards over a balcony into the canyon below. Your typical cinematographer would have focused on this.  Instead Lachman has this scene in the far background while the main shot is of Valentine having a good time at his party feeling totally safe and relaxed in his multi-million dollar home.So the bottom-line, is The Limey a great film, I don't think so. Did I love it, not really.  Was I bored with it, no quite.  I guess it captured my interest in a different and quiet way that most films don't and for that I recommend it.  Also when was the last time you saw 70's semi-icons, Barry Newman (TV's 1974 Petrocelli), Leslie Ann Warren  and once hunky Andy Warhol mainstay, Joe Dallesandro.  Recommended.

If the movies are made for Trekkies, then most of the general public won't watch, and Paramount will lose money. A good example of this is Generations. Massive implications if you are a Trek fan, but not important to anyone not familiar with the series. First Contact is slanted toward the general public, and thus many Trekkies claim that Paramount is selling out , and alienating true fans. I'm a Trekkie, but I still love this movie. The acting is great. Nobody ever complains about Patrick Stewart, and with good reason. He puts in a masterful, if overly emotional performance. The only member of the cast to annoy me is Martina Sirtis as Troi, but I have never liked the character. Thankfully, she recieves little air time. Alfre Woodard as Lily is excellent, and James Cromwell puts in a suitably drunken performance as Cochrane. The Queen Alice Krige is spooky and seductive enough, and of course the Borg drones are scary. It is interesting to hear Kelsey Grammar back on board the Bozeman, a nice little touch. Also, as always, links are made to other series with Ethan Phillips Neelix in Voyager appearing in the holodeck scene. There are rumours that Avery Brooks was supposed to be in it, but I'm not sure. A good cast all up. The special effects from Industrial Light and Magic are great, and did anyone else see that the nebula toward the start of the film looked like a giant cat? A great touch. There are so many memorable quotes and scenes from this film, but the one in Picard's Ready Room with Lily is one I will never forget. Perhaps a little too emotional, but one of the best Trek scenes of all time. The Borg are finally back to their terrifing best, something lacking in their last few episodes. There are few sci-fi villains that are better. The plot is average, but the film is so fast that you don't have time to care. Many people are incensed that this Cochrane is so different to the one in TOS, but I missed that era, so I'm neutral. Overall, a great movie, but still falls behind Star Trek VI.

I could go on for years talking about their offscreen rivalry, but I should also note that The Women is a great movie. In addition to an all-star cast (headed by many a Scarlett O'Hara reject by GWTW's fired director George Cukor), there are no males - even male animals - in the film. The script is great, too. Shearer, Crawford, Russell, Fontaine, and Goddard spit lines at each other like nobody's business.

I could go on for years talking about their offscreen rivalry, but I should also note that The Women is a great movie. In addition to an all-star cast (headed by many a Scarlett O'Hara reject by GWTW's fired director George Cukor), there are no males - even male animals - in the film. The script is great, too. Shearer, Crawford, Russell, Fontaine, and Goddard spit lines at each other like nobody's business. Most people will agree with me that this is a first-rate movie that no film buff should miss under any circumstances.

Last Night is a smart, sweet film about people facing the fictitious end of the world.  It is told from the vantage point of the last six hours on earth for several different people - a dysfunctional family whose only son wants to witness the end by himself, a woman separated from her husband and left to decide if she will carry out their mutual agreement, a sex addict who appetite knows no time limit, a gas company executive and his trustworthy secretary who try to carry on as usual, and a lonely French teacher whose students are her only comfort.  Writer, director, and star Don McKellar has fashioned a well-acted film with dialogue which is both comical and yet poignant.  Sandra has her car (could it be an AMC Gremlin?) totally dismantled by a punk mob and left standing on its end and she sobs that 'someone has killed her car'.  Later she tells Patrick as time is running out to 'tell me something to make me love you'. Again Sandra, deciding whether to witness the final cataclysmic event, says to Patrick,   'I 'd much rather it came from you'. Craig, with his hand-scribbled listing on his kitchen wall of sexual adventures he needs to accomplish, tells Patrick he would like mutual orgasm to which Patrick says, 'I must be leaving'.  At the dinner table, with turkey and lamb and all the feasting,  Patrick's mother cries her heart out with a steady, low shrill as daughter Jennifer pretends nothing is wrong and says 'let's get started'.  Finally, Craig and his final consort, the gas company executive's secretary, come together and she tells him 'it's time to get to work'.  Few films can dramatize how it would be like, on a gut level, when the end is near.  On The Beach is one example.  Last Night has that same mesmerizing quality of closeness and compassion.  Kudos for this splendid Canadian film and all the fine performances, starting with McKellar, Sandra Oh, Genevieve Bujold, David Cronenberg (of all people) and Callum Keith Renne.

Fight Club is a totally wicked satire about male bonding, self-expectations and our inability to deal with the so-called system.  Before this movie even came out, it was being blasted for its violence and possibility of encouraging such fight clubs; total nonsense. The movie does not give so much to these actions, as does the publicity generated by an irresponsible media and the so-called watch dogs that actually plant the notion into people's heads.Fight Club is based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk and I could not think of a better novel to be adapted for the screen to show the angst toward the inhuman society that we have created and let run rampant.   Edward Norton is the unnamed narrator who is a totally disillusioned worker bee who suffers from insomnia.  To deal with his situation he seeks out support groups that deal with terminal illnesses.  Still not finding any type of release, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt, sporting an amazing set of six packs) and his life will never be the same.  The two form not only a strange bond, but also an underground club where men do battle with each other to unleash their everyday frustrations with the world and themselves.  Now if the film was only about the violence and fighting, it would succumb to boredom very quickly, but this is a highly intelligent film that has much to say about men and the society that men have created and have to deal with.Director David Fincher displays a very visual knack and handles the back and forth time element with ease.  The fight scenes, stunningly staged, are amazing to watch, but not for the faint of heart, they are brutal and bloody.  The dialogue is intelligent, faced-paced and quite funny, while the acting is top notch.  In Pitt and Norton, you have two of today's finest young actors, not to mention the biggest risk takers on the movie star list.  These two, especially Pitt, take chances that other actors of their caliber would not even think of, only Johnny Depp and Nicholas Cage comes to mind.  Add Tyler Durden to the top of Brad Pitt's off-kilter characters and Edward Norton continues to astonish with his characterizations.  In a major supporting role, Helena Bonham Carter creates an intense, memorable performance as the hard-edged gal who has entered the life of Norton and Pitt.Being John Malkovich is being touted as the original film this year and although I have not seen it, I would rank Fight Club up there in originality.  This film is one of the best this year, not too mention a cult hit in the making.  As far as the media condemning it as a reason for young men to act out, I'm sorry but this film is too highly evolved, sophisticated and intelligent for your average male teenager raised on Adam Sandler movies and ultra non-hip Saturday Night Live episodes to endure.  Come to think of it, Fight Club is not for your average moviegoer and that is a good thing. Highly Recommend.
