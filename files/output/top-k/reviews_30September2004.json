The leads, as well as the supporting cast appear instantly at ease with believing in re-incarnation, as well as the power of fate. The character of a former psychiatrist-turned-meat-cutter, played by Robin Willimas, not only instantly buys the life after death hokus pokus, but without hesitation suggests that the main character kill his wife from a former life, to beat her to the punch. Towards the end there is an elaborate multi-layered scene that is rather fascinating. It lasts about 2-3 minutes. The rest of the film is insultingly ridiculous. If you must see this huddled mess of a film, watch for how one of the supporting characters speaks with an exaggerated German accent, decades later the accent is an exaggerated British one. The identical looks of characters who died some 40 years ago (captured by LIFE magazine stories) and the present day counter parts doesn't seem to phase any of the characters.

It's essentially a rehash of many of his earlier films, with a plot partially derived from The Thirty Nine Steps and the very similar Saboteur, while there are borrowings from Foreign Correspondent and Notorious, among others. However, it is all done with such style and confidence that it doesn't matter if it's essentially just a greatest hits package.Very few other films of this kind attain the near perfect tone of this one, precariously balanced between seriousness and silliness. Sometimes this film manages the very difficult trick of being both suspenseful and comical at the same time, as in the auction house scene, or the wonderful scene in the lift when the hero's mother turns to two heavies in a lift looking menacingly at the hero and says you gentlemen are not REALLY trying to kill my son, are you?.Of course the famous crop dusting plane scene and the Mount Rushmore chase are terrific. The former is really more notable for the amount of time taken to build up to the action than the action itself, while the technical work on the latter still looks pretty good. In a totally different vein is the astonishingly frank seduction sequence on the train. Hitchcock takes his time here as with many of the other scenes, but the film is so crammed with memorable passages that one hardly notices it's 136 mins long.Ernest Lehman's script is full of wonderful lines, many of them delivered so well by chief villain James Mason that at times we almost want to root for him. Has any one ever told you tend to overplay your various roles Mr Kaplan....it seems to me you fellows could stand a little less training from the FBI and a little more from the Actor's Studio.

I did and their enthusiasm was contagious.Both Richard Dreyfuss and Jenna Elfman are frenetic actors and perfectly suited for their parts. The other actors were equally good.The director, Todd Holland, deserves special kudos for small touches. For example, there is a dinner at the end of the movie for octogenarians and he has most of them sitting around in catatonic states and being fed by caregivers. It's a small thing but the kind of thing that, IMHO, separates an average director from a good one. Expect to come away smiling and with a good feeling. For me that makes this movie memorable.

I bought in on DVD and I have been entertained since. But last night I watched from a more critical stance than usual and found some flaws in this movie that I thought was very good. First of all, I love Ice Cube and what he's done with his career and how he branched off from music to movies. He's one of the few rappers that can hold their own on either side of the camera. He also seems to know his limitations. He enlists others to handle the over-the-top comedy for those qualified. Mike Epps was a very good choice. At times his jokes can fall flat, but the hilarity of his funny moments make up for the missteps.I watched 'All About the Benjamins' last night and I was in stitches laughing at the shower torture scene. I rewinded that bad boy at least five times and watched it again once more before I went to sleep for one more chuckle. Oddly enough, it wasn't Ice Cube, Mike Epps, or even the torture that I found funny. It was the torturee (Julian Ramose played by Roger Guenveur Smith). When he mouthed off at Mike Epps' character (Reggie) I was rolling all over the place uncontrollably. This movie's script could have been better, but I've seen much worse. I was never bored and I will watch this movie many more times in the future. Ice Cube should employ better writers in the future. This could be a gem with smarter dialogue. We watch movies too, you know. I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. That one scene getting rewound so much was a HUGE factor. See this if you get a chance.

Of course, people are expected to die eventually and its up to Arnold to prove the system wrong.I haven't read the Stephen King book, but this is a great film regardless, one of Arnold's best. He does what he does best in the action man role, delivering death with unforgettable one-liners. Classics are probably the 'He was a real pain in the neck' after strangling a guy with barb wire, and 'He had to split!', referring to whereabouts he just chain sawed someone vertically. Dawson is perfectly irritating as the TV presenter, and all the 'Stalkers' are suitably camp. The action is violent, but its an action film. That's the point. The film is fast paced, and at 90 minutes it doesn't overstay its welcome.

A company wishes to get rich by selling parcels of land to speculators. A team of salesmen are assembled to make the sales. An unknown group of buyers (the leads) are out there for the salesmen to lock onto and talk into buying the parcels. Are the parcels of any value? We do not know, it is not important.

The boys downtown are unhappy with the level of sales, a cleaner is sent in motivate the salesmen. It is a new motivation the closers of contracts get their names on the board, a chance to win first prize, a Cadillac Eldorado, second prize, a set of steak knifes, third prize, you're fired. Who is the motivator? A new kid on the block (Alec Baldwin) with a watch that cost more than the salesmen's cars, who drove to the meeting in a $80,000 BMW, and who earned $970,000 last year. And the salesmen? One of them was Shelley Levene (an outstanding Jack Lemmon). We gather that he needs money desperately, his daughter is in hospital, there are bills to pay. And he hits the script running - a man so deep into despair, his situation so hopeless that you can almost touch it, and his attempts to disguise this, to remain upbeat, above all to sell, sell, sell. This was a cruel film. The company wants to get rich and doesn't care what depths the salesmen go to, the salesmen want to make a living, and we assume that buyers buy because they see this as some get rich quick scheme. Greed, greed, greed. And then there's Shelley Levene who cannot speak to his daughter because the phone company disconnected her phone because the bill wasn't paid. And he needs the money! If it wasn't a film you would try and make contact so you could give it to him. It was that kind of film. It was very uncomfortable viewing.

If it were released into theaters today, Tron would be a smash hit, 'cause the movie-audiences of today would understand it a heckuva lot better than the movie-audiences of 1982.Tron tells the story of a young computer programmer named Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who gets sucked INTO a computer, and must fight for his life playing life-or-death video games, run by the evil Master Control Program. With the aid of a good warrior program named Tron (Bruce Boxleitner), and Tron's significant-other Yori (Cindy Morgan), Flynn must put a stop to the MCP and set things right in the computer world once again before returning to his own world.With breathtakingly beautiful computer-animation (and the very first film to use computer-animation extensively), and presenting an original, dazzling world where energy lives and breathes inside a computer, Tron was way ahead of it's time. This may explain why the film was greeted with incomprehension from critics and audience members alike back in 1982.The problem was, back in 1982, there was no such thing as the Internet, and, apart from business types, most people didn't really know diddlysquat about computers yet. As a result, the computer jargon heard throughout Tron went sailing over most audience members' heads, and for many, the story was difficult to follow. Critics complained that Tron was all special effects and no story. And, for the final insult, Tron wasn't even NOMINATED for Best Visual Effects at Oscar time, presumably because the Academy in 1982 didn't recognize computer-animation as genuine visual effects, i.e. it's animation, not visual effects, they thought to themselves. The Abyss changed all that in 1989, but that was a big seven years after Tron. Obviously, everyone in 1982 had missed the film's point.But the passing of time has been very kind to Tron. Today, the film has a major cult following, and is recognized by many as the landmark sci-fi film that it truly is. Looking at Tron today, the movie has aged very well indeed, like a fine wine. Now that time--and people's knowledge of computers--has finally caught up with Tron, now would be the PERFECT time for the world in general to take another look at this amazing film.Message to Disney put Tron back in theaters!
