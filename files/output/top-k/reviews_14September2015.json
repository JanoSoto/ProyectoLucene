For me, this is a timeless comedy and no doubt I will still enjoy it 10 years from now.I usually find myself rolling my eyes when I read some reviews saying that this film isn't realistic or that the classes the Double D's attend wouldn't exist because there would be no spare time due to all their training. I guess these people missed the explanation on how the classes came to be not long into the film. I think people really need to get a grip. This isn't a Documentary...this is a fictional comedy (and an enjoyable one at that) and it should be enjoyed as that.Regardless of what certain people think of it, the story is actually quite a credible one...it's pretty well written, excellently acted out, and is definitely a feel-good story too. Is it a wee bit predictable? Yes, but then again who cares? A comedy doesn't have to have toilet humour, drunken idiots, or be full of 20-somethings playing annoying teenies to be enjoyable, and thankfully Renaissance Man doesn't have any of those.All of the cast do a great job, especially Danny DeVito as Bill Rago. Everything was done with convincing conviction, and he made Shakespeare interesting. Honestly, if I had an English teacher like Rago when I was at school, then I might have enjoyed Shakespeare a lot more than what I did. Gregory Sporleder was enjoyable as Pvt. Melvyn, Lillo Brancato done a decent job as Pvt. Benitez (especially with all of his Jake La Motta impressions), and I actually think this is one of the few films where Mark Wahlberg didn't come across as being as wooden as Pinocchio either. Round all of this off with some great songs for the soundtrack (especially the Double D rap and end credit tune) and you have yourself a very enjoyable film to watch.It's just a pity all comedies aren't as enjoyable as this.

Freddy's goal is to create new Elm Streets, and begin a new killing spree after having killed of all of the children in Springwood.Maggie, utilizing new dreams techniques, uncovers Krueger's past, which include being taunted by schoolmates for being the son of 100 maniacs, being cruel to animals, beaten by his stepfather, the murder of his own wife when she discovers he has been killing children and the moment when the Dream Demons arrive in his boiler room to make him the offer of eternal life. Eventually, Maggie pulls Freddy out of the dream world and uses a pipe bomb to blow him up.The story is a little scary, but also funny as heck. It is considered the worst idea for the movie, but it works for me and to say the least, it is the best of A Nightmare on Elm Street film series, for me, along with the 1984 and 2010 versions of the original film, the 2003 crossover film with Jason Voorhees, the fourth film, the third and second film and Wes Craven's New Nightmare.Like I said, the only Nightmare on Elm Street film I have mixed emotions over is A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 The Dream Child.There's not much to say about the visuals and design, but they are incredible as they were back in 1991, when this film came out. The way the comedy and horror works with Freddy is just as impressive and inspiring. The music is just cool as hell. Brian May is a great composer and he done a very great job with the music in the film and the famous original theme is in this film.The acting is a little confusing, but I will give credit to Lisa Zane as Maggie Burroughs \/ Katherine Krueger. She does a great job and I don't think she could have been worse in any of the scenes in this film. Robert Englund returns as Freddy Krueger and his performances is cool as hell. My favorite scenes are when Freddy tells Maggie, Every town has an Elm Street and the parody of the Wicked Witch of the West from The Wizard of Oz.My favorite nightmare is the video game nightmare and that was really funny, scary, but also really cool and amazing. It was fantastic, man. The rest of the cast is just out there at times, but the really cool thing about it is Lezlie Deane, Yaphet Kotto, Breckin Meyer and Ricky Dean Logan is really amazing and so great in some of the scenes.Overall, Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare is not a horror movie, it's like a horror \/ comedy movie and is not the best film in the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, but it could have been a hell of a lot worse.6 out of 10 stars.

Lets take a look at cast & crew first of all Spielberg of course became an Academy Award winning superstar, but also many others reached great things in their careers long after this film. Feldman became one of the defining kids actors of his generation. Brolin is an Oscar nominee. So is Sean Astin apart from starring in the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy. Ramsey became an Oscar nominee the same year that this one came out. Columbus is an Oscar nominee too. Plimpton and Pantoliano are Emmy winners. Ontiveros is an Emmy nominee. Davy became a really good Bond villain. So there is certainly lots of talent united in this film.Unfortunately, these almost 2 hours (fairly long for a kids movie) did not turn out a 100% successful movie. There are some nice scenes in terms of adventure, comedy etc. for example the one when Chunk tells that he knows who the 3 villains are and can describe them to the police unknowingly that he is talking to them, but there are some bad moments too, like in the end when the father tear the contract into pieces. A classic example of overacting and there are more of these when the script simply tries to be too ambitious for its own good. Another example would be the meaningful speech by Astin's character down in the cave. So yeah, not a bad watch by any means, but not a truly epic children's movie either as many people consider it. Something in-between. All in all, I recommend it, but one watch is enough. Actually I am a bit surprised they never made a sequel for this one just like they did for many other very famous 80 films, for example Back into the Future. Oh well, probably for the better I guess.

The film is based on a novel of the same name by Ira Levin and it's the 2nd film in Polanski's 'Apartment Trilogy'. The film is about a married couple - Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse who move into the Bramford, a Manhattan apartment. They get introduced to a nosy and odd neighbouring couple - The Castevets who start intruding in their lives a lot. Finally when Rosemary gets pregnant, she starts becoming more and more suspicious about the neighbours as well as her husband.Polanski had already made 'Repulsion' in 1965 which was the 1st film in his 'Apartment Trilogy' and his 1st film in the English language. But 'Rosemary's Baby' was his first big-budget film and this was also the 1st big-budget Hollywood horror film. But like a true product of its time, it still had the audacity to have ambiguity as one of its qualities unlike the big-budget Hollywood studio productions of the current era. Like 'Repulsion', this film can also be interpreted in many different ways.The first way to interpret it will be to view it as a work on female liberation. This was made in the 60s when the feminist movement was finally starting to have some impact. One can view the film and opine that Polanski is showing how a woman is being dominated by others and others' opinions are being forced upon her during her pregnancy when all the decisions should rest with her. She starts becoming more and more distant from her husband due to the fact even he fails to understand her mindset and starts dominating her.The second way to interpret the film will be to take everything literally. The viewer can decide to not go too much into subtexts and themes and take the film for what it is and get immersed in this interesting story of a woman and her pregnancy. The third way to interpret the film will be to view it as an allegory on how women can seem excessively paranoid and whimsical during pregnancy from a male point of view.The fourth way to interpret it will be to view the film as the struggle of a woman with a Catholic background to adjust herself to the new and changing society of the 1960s, a decade during which non-conformism and counterculture became a craze. Her paranoia gets the better of her and she begins to fear the prospect of bringing a new child to a world and a society which is straying away from her beliefs and so she tries to distance herself and her unborn baby from all folks that she suspects to have 'questionable' beliefs and faiths.The beauty of the screenplay written by Polanski himself, is that it facilitates all the interpretations that can be possible. The screenplay is open and provides hints and scopes for viewers to take the film and accept in their own way. I especially loved the ending of the film as I think it is a beautiful tribute to mothers and motherly love.Another very important aspect of the film is the style of storytelling. Polanski uses surrealism with some dream sequences that are truly weird and effective. Just like 'Repulsion', Polanski blurs the distinctions between what is real and what is being imagined by using a paranoid and sort of unreliable narrator as the whole film is from the point of view of Rosemary who is in pretty much every scene.Mia Farrow is absolutely brilliant as the titular Rosemary. She looks incredibly gaunt and petite in the film to underline her fragility. She beautifully pulls off the transition from being sweet and gullible to being flat out paranoid. I also loved Ruth Gordon as Minnie Castevet. She richly deserved the Oscar that she won for this role. She is dynamite in every scene she is in. She puts in a method performance so brilliantly that the viewer is always guessing whether to believe her or not.'Rosemary's Baby' is a very influential horror film. It uses psychological horror to explore deeper themes without resorting to cheap scares, but it still is pretty disturbing. This film is an absolute masterpiece which I can't recommend highly enough.

","genre":"Drama, Horror"},{"date":"14 September 2015","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" 'Rosemary's Baby' is perhaps the most popular and well known Roman Polanski film after 'Chinatown'. The film is based on a novel of the same name by Ira Levin and it's the 2nd film in Polanski's 'Apartment Trilogy'. The film is about a married couple - Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse who move into the Bramford, a Manhattan apartment. They get introduced to a nosy and odd neighbouring couple - The Castevets who start intruding in their lives a lot. Finally when Rosemary gets pregnant, she starts becoming more and more suspicious about the neighbours as well as her husband.Polanski had already made 'Repulsion' in 1965 which was the 1st film in his 'Apartment Trilogy' and his 1st film in the English language. But 'Rosemary's Baby' was his first big-budget film and this was also the 1st big-budget Hollywood horror film. But like a true product of its time, it still had the audacity to have ambiguity as one of its qualities unlike the big-budget Hollywood studio productions of the current era. Like 'Repulsion', this film can also be interpreted in many different ways.The first way to interpret it will be to view it as a work on female liberation. This was made in the 60s when the feminist movement was finally starting to have some impact. One can view the film and opine that Polanski is showing how a woman is being dominated by others and others' opinions are being forced upon her during her pregnancy when all the decisions should rest with her. She starts becoming more and more distant from her husband due to the fact even he fails to understand her mindset and starts dominating her.The second way to interpret the film will be to take everything literally. The viewer can decide to not go too much into subtexts and themes and take the film for what it is and get immersed in this interesting story of a woman and her pregnancy. The third way to interpret the film will be to view it as an allegory on how women can seem excessively paranoid and whimsical during pregnancy from a male point of view.The fourth way to interpret it will be to view the film as the struggle of a woman with a Catholic background to adjust herself to the new and changing society of the 1960s, a decade during which non-conformism and counterculture became a craze. Her paranoia gets the better of her and she begins to fear the prospect of bringing a new child to a world and a society which is straying away from her beliefs and so she tries to distance herself and her unborn baby from all folks that she suspects to have 'questionable' beliefs and faiths.The beauty of the screenplay written by Polanski himself, is that it facilitates all the interpretations that can be possible. The screenplay is open and provides hints and scopes for viewers to take the film and accept in their own way. I especially loved the ending of the film as I think it is a beautiful tribute to mothers and motherly love.Another very important aspect of the film is the style of storytelling. Polanski uses surrealism with some dream sequences that are truly weird and effective. Just like 'Repulsion', Polanski blurs the distinctions between what is real and what is being imagined by using a paranoid and sort of unreliable narrator as the whole film is from the point of view of Rosemary who is in pretty much every scene.Mia Farrow is absolutely brilliant as the titular Rosemary.

At 7 years of age, you get told it enough times, you believe it. You believe the hatred. You live it... you breathe it. You marry it.Alan Parker's 1988 film which was nominated for seven Academy Awards is another reminder of what a great career Gene Hackman had, although this time he got to share the spotlight with a pair of other wonderful performances from Willem Dafoe and Frances McDormand. The fact that Mississippi Burning isn't even considered one of Hackman's top ten most popular films just proves how many great films he's made over the span of five decades (he retired from acting in 2004). Since the film was loosely based on a real incident surrounding the disappearance of some civil rights workers in the south during the 60's many people complained that the film wasn't faithful to the story, but Parker never made such a claim and always said his film was a fictional tale of events that could've taken place during the time so I don't see any need to complain about it. Some similarities can be found with the classic film directed by Norman Jewison, In the Heat of the Night, which handles a similar theme about racism. Films like this are important reminders of how dangerous humans can be when they let hate and racism govern their hearts. It is so easy at times to forget those dark moments in our history and act like they never happened, but once in a while we get films like Mississippi Burning that remind us of the horrors of humanity and the sacrifice people made to end them. These are films with important messages which also happen to be well made and count with a stellar cast. Its only Oscar win was for Peter Biziou's wonderful cinematography, but there is so much more worth recommending about this classic from the 80's. The film introduces us to three civil rights workers as they are detained by a police vehicle while they were about to exit a small Mississippi town. The officers begin making all sorts of hateful remarks towards these men and violently shoot them for trying to stir up their quiet and organized segregated town. A few days later, two FBI agents show up in town looking for these disappeared citizens, who they fear have been murdered. Agent Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) is in charge of the operation despite his young age. His partner, Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman), is more experienced and is not afraid to speak his mind about him as someone he believes to be well educated but lacking more field work. Ward likes to do things by the books, but Anderson who was a former Sheriff in a similar Mississippi town knows the mentality of these places and believes his methods won't get them anywhere in a place like this. The Mayor (R. Lee Ermey) isn't pleased with the agents visit because he believes his segregation methods work and that things are run differently here than in the south. The agents learn it quickly while they're trying to collaborate with the local officers. Sheriff Ray Stuckey (Gaylord Sartain) is very protective of his boys, especially of Deputy Clinton (Brad Dourif) and officer Frank (Michael Rooker) who were the officers involved in the murder. It doesn't take the agents too long to realize what happened, but they can't find anyone in town who will speak to them since the victims have been threatened by the KKK. Every time someone seems to be interested in speaking up, they are immediately intimidated by the gang through violent acts. Ward's tactics don't seem to have an effect, but Anderson may have found the perfect ally in Mrs. Pell (Frances McDormand), the Deputy's wife who rejects his actions. The script handles the civil rights case with care and avoids falling into melodramatic territory by remaining gripping and suspenseful. There are plenty of thrills along the way and some violent scenes that are actually less horrifying than the hateful things these men say. It's true that the civil right theme is told through a white's man point of view, but I think it still remains compelling and well intentioned. In the end it becomes entirely a revenge action film, but it's handled in a convincing and realistic way. Hackman, Dafoe, and McDormand are in the center of the movie and they all deliver gripping performances playing off each other extremely well. Brad Dourif and Michael Rooker are given the stereotypical racist characters who are very easy to hate. Rooker seems to be playing the same character from The Walking Dead series only this time he actually acts upon his remarks more than simply being a loud mouth. Hackman and Dafoe are on the same side despite having very different approaches and that difference helps build the tension and relationships in the film. Parker's sensitive direction works in a film with such a controversial subject matter that could be easily manipulated. Mississippi Burning is a classic that shouldn't be missed by fans of Gene Hackman and his impressive career. http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"14 September 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Hatred isn't something you're born with.

Now, I can't say which actor is better as Freddy Krueger because I like both of them. I know my sister LeeAnn is going to curse me out for saying this, but I'm gonna say it anyway. I actually prefer both actors playing Freddy Krueger. Sure, Jackie Earle Haley may not have the comedic stuff like Robert Englund, but he does do one thing right play the part of Krueger in a scary way, much like Englund does in the original 1984 film and it's sequels. Heather Langenkamp plays Nancy Thompson and she would play the part of Nancy again in A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors and she would also play herself and Nancy in Wes Craven's New Nightmare. Johnny Depp plays Glen in the first film of his career and a lot of people said that this is his worst performance, but I actually like him in the first Freddy Krueger film.

The film was released in 1988 in theaters and was released.The story of Kristen Parker continues in this film, but this time, Kristen unwittingly releases Freddy, who immediately kills Kincaid and Joey. Before Freddy can kill Kristen, she transfers her dream powers to Alice, a friend from school.Alice begins inadvertently providing victims for Freddy when she begins pulling people into her dreams while she sleeps. Alice, who begins taking on the friends who were murdered, confronts Freddy. She uses the power of the Dream Master to release all the souls Freddy has taken. They subsequently rip themselves from Freddy's body, killing him in the process.The story is really not bad and I really like the dialogue written for each character and the film is just wonderfully shot and edited. The visuals back then in 1988 were really tough to pull off, but it was really cool and amazing for today's world in this day and age.The music is really dark and sinister and the Freddy Krueger theme does play at some point. I love the dark and sinister tone of the film and also comedic at certain points.

The credit is all given to Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger and he is alright in his fourth portrayal as Freddy Krueger and I really got to see more humor and there is one scene and that is Kristen's nightmare at the beach and he really does kill it with his awesome humor.Since Patricia Arquette could not return due to her being involved in other projects, Tuesday Knight fills in for her as Kristen Parker and she definitely nails her performance and it could have been worse, but it is a damn good performance for this character.Lisa Wilcox plays our new primary protagonist, Alice Johnson and she does a damn good job in playing the role of Alice and it is not Oscar worthy, but it is really good and she was the perfect choice to a new enemy to our antagonist, Freddy Krueger.Danny Hassle plays Alice's boyfriend, Dan Jordan and he is top-notch and just like Lisa Wilcox, he could not have done any better. They have great chemistry on the screen and it definitely shows all the way throughout this entire fourth Nightmare on Elm Street film in the scary film franchise.The rest of the cast is just out there and they make either a huge or very little effort to put on a darn good performance and it is really intense and I really can't blame them because they try they're absolute best but does not deliver when they really need too.The nightmares in this film are just incredible You have Freddy Krueger sucking the life out of one girl, turning her into a cockroach and that was pretty cool. The other nightmare is Kristen's two nightmares at the beginning and middle of the film and those are way too scary, but I love them because they are like this.

Sheila is killed by an intense asthma attack. Rick is in a mixed-martial arts nightmare fight and that was really intense and violent. All of the nightmares are not bad, but they are just very dark and serious in a few areas, but Robert Englund's comedy is really amazing and spectacular.Overall, A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 The Dream Master is just amazing and really scary. It just brings a lot cool stuff into it and the nightmares are really cool and disturbing, but the comedy is in this film a lot more. Alice Johnson's story would continue the next film, which I talk about my hatred feelings, A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 The Dream Child. and this film is really amazing with blending horror and comedy together throughout the whole movie.I give this film a 8 out of 10 stars.

In the opening minute I almost thought I was watching a horror movie, the way the cinematographer went from one scene to another, aided by the fact that Xanadu looked haunted.The trivia for Citizen Kane was some of the most interesting trivia I've ever read. Orson Welles wrote and acted the character of Charles Foster Kane superbly well, and I suppose also did well directing himself. If this movie does anything, it is displaying yellow journalism and corrupted almost-politicians. Only Charles Foster Kane would think it fun to run a newspaper. At times Kane appears to be the man he wants people to think he is a loving, kind, honest man, who would fit better than any other eligible man as the governor. Thanks to his friends, we brutally discover the true man underneath the layer of fake skin a selfish, heartless man who only has one true goal in life success, which he believes will also bring him happiness. But success cannot buy happiness, which he seemingly doesn't find out until his final dying moments.This movie was definitely not one of my Great Movies, as it was Ebert's. As interesting as this movie was, the thing that nagged at my mind the most was the fact that, if he died when he was alone, how does anyone know what his final words were? Somehow, amazingly, this thought apparently never did occur to Welles or any of the other cast, crew, or producers until after it was released, whereas it occurred to me within ten minutes, as I'm sure it did to many other viewers. Did Ebert himself miss this fact, even after hundreds of viewings, or somehow shrug it off, even after doing an audio commentary on it? Perhaps I can see how he shrugged it off, considering I have done the same on other movies I've enjoyed, though the problems were less obvious and less important to the plot.This movie seems almost documentary-style, first giving us a summary of his life, then going back and addressing each plot point in more detail. The movie's strong points were the directing, characterization, and cinematography, and Welles' acting, although the other actors were quite disappointing. The movie was interesting and fun to watch, and the mystery kept us intrigued, although it was not quite what I was expecting.

The few remaining children have been placed in Westin Hills Mental Institution, for allegedly attempting suicide. Nancy Thompson arrives at Westin Hills as a new intern and realizes the children are being killed by Freddy in their dreams.With the help of Dr. Neil Gordon, Nancy helps Kristen, Taryn, Joel, Kincaid and Will find their dream powers, so they can kill Freddy once and for all. But in all scary movies, the killer never dies. Neil, unknowingly until the end, meets the spirit of Freddy's mother, Amanda Krueger, who instructs him to bury Freddy's remains in hallowed ground in order to stop him for good.Neil completes his task, but not before Freddy kills Nancy, but Kristen kills Freddy. The film ends with Neil sleeping in his own bed with a dream doll and Kristen's model of 1428 Elm Street. As he sleeps, the bedroom light in the model comes on, revealing that Freddy is still alive and setting up a new installment.I had to say I almost did not watch this film because I thought it was just a rip-off of the previous film, Freddy's Revenge, but after watching the trailer for the film in 2010, I actually really wanted to see how this would turn and finally in 2013, I got to see this movie and it was one of the best viewing experiences ever.Unlike other franchises like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this franchise along Halloween and Friday the 13th knows how to stay true to it's source material and this was the 80's and still today. This was the movie that changed Freddy Krueger turned from just creepy to creepy and funny at the same time.This film has the old cast with a new set of character and that works for a movie like this. The cast strikes an awesome balance of suspense and comedy, this definitely goes to Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger, he does a darn good job this time around. The effects were cheesy, but also good for the 1980's and were very awesome as hell. The dreams are as creepy and intense and just like the first film, they build up to each other with suspense.The cast is really strong here and we can tell that they care about their characters that they are playing, especially Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon, who says that this is their favorite film and also had the best roles in the original 1984 classic film, A Nightmare on Elm Street.Patricia Arquette is really amazing as Kristen and she did a damn good job making her performance believable as I thought she would.The only person that I was not expecting to be in A Nightmare on Elm Street film was Laurence Fishburne, who is known as Ike Turner in What's Love Got to Do With It and as Morpheus in The Matrix trilogy. He does a darn good job and really awesome to play in this film. Really cool and really amazing casting choices.It's a good scary movie flick where the characters actually fight between the dream controller and the ending may have you crying because Nancy dies, but it also makes you really get scared of the way it ends. It is really cool.Freddy Krueger has the coolest lines ever written and I am really glad that Wes Craven came back and help with the screenplay. He is still scary, still creepy, but can also get very comedic at points, especially in the TV nightmare sequence where he tells the girl, Welcome to prime time, girl! and that is one of the best lines ever written for an iconic horror movie character.This film is just spectacular. From the music to the acting to the effects to the incredible performance of Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger, you will find an incredible experience in seeing this film.Overall, there may be a couple of flaws, but it is easy to see why people watches this one second instead of A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 Freddy's Revenge. I love it for everything that it does right and I like this one, better than the second one, but I still watch the second one, the first one, the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh film.

I also like Freddy vs. Jason and the 2010 remake of the original film.My rating is going to be 7 \/ 10, not a bad rating, but it is a little bit good. ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"14 September 2015","score":"","review":" Despite the negative critical reaction that Freddy's Revenge got, the movie was a financial success and in 1987, Wes Craven returned to write A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors, which was the second sequel in the Nightmare on Elm Street film franchise.In the second sequel, Freddy Krueger is systematically killing the last of the Elm Street children. The few remaining children have been placed in Westin Hills Mental Institution, for allegedly attempting suicide. Nancy Thompson arrives at Westin Hills as a new intern and realizes the children are being killed by Freddy in their dreams.With the help of Dr. Neil Gordon, Nancy helps Kristen, Taryn, Joel, Kincaid and Will find their dream powers, so they can kill Freddy once and for all. But in all scary movies, the killer never dies. Neil, unknowingly until the end, meets the spirit of Freddy's mother, Amanda Krueger, who instructs him to bury Freddy's remains in hallowed ground in order to stop him for good.Neil completes his task, but not before Freddy kills Nancy, but Kristen kills Freddy. The film ends with Neil sleeping in his own bed with a dream doll and Kristen's model of 1428 Elm Street. As he sleeps, the bedroom light in the model comes on, revealing that Freddy is still alive and setting up a new installment.I had to say I almost did not watch this film because I thought it was just a rip-off of the previous film, Freddy's Revenge, but after watching the trailer for the film in 2010, I actually really wanted to see how this would turn and finally in 2013, I got to see this movie and it was one of the best viewing experiences ever.Unlike other franchises like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this franchise along Halloween and Friday the 13th knows how to stay true to it's source material and this was the 80's and still today. This was the movie that changed Freddy Krueger turned from just creepy to creepy and funny at the same time.This film has the old cast with a new set of character and that works for a movie like this. The cast strikes an awesome balance of suspense and comedy, this definitely goes to Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger, he does a darn good job this time around. The effects were cheesy, but also good for the 1980's and were very awesome as hell. The dreams are as creepy and intense and just like the first film, they build up to each other with suspense.The cast is really strong here and we can tell that they care about their characters that they are playing, especially Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon, who says that this is their favorite film and also had the best roles in the original 1984 classic film, A Nightmare on Elm Street.Patricia Arquette is really amazing as Kristen and she did a damn good job making her performance believable as I thought she would.The only person that I was not expecting to be in A Nightmare on Elm Street film was Laurence Fishburne, who is known as Ike Turner in What's Love Got to Do With It and as Morpheus in The Matrix trilogy. He does a darn good job and really awesome to play in this film. Really cool and really amazing casting choices.It's a good scary movie flick where the characters actually fight between the dream controller and the ending may have you crying because Nancy dies, but it also makes you really get scared of the way it ends. It is really cool.Freddy Krueger has the coolest lines ever written and I am really glad that Wes Craven came back and help with the screenplay. He is still scary, still creepy, but can also get very comedic at points, especially in the TV nightmare sequence where he tells the girl, Welcome to prime time, girl! and that is one of the best lines ever written for an iconic horror movie character.This film is just spectacular. From the music to the acting to the effects to the incredible performance of Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger, you will find an incredible experience in seeing this film.Overall, there may be a couple of flaws, but it is easy to see why people watches this one second instead of A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 Freddy's Revenge.

If you're over thirty, where were you at that age? Maybe starting to figure out your life. Maybe finally getting a stable, well-playing job and starting to take relationships seriously. Brian Singer was directing one of the best movies of the nineties. Not that he was the only directing prodigy of the nineties. This decade in film say two trends above all else. One, the fluid, dynamic, dark cinematic stylings which were reserved for only 'real', 'serious' movies in the past spread throughout the industry. And two a crop of new young directors come into the spotlight en masse right as the industry needed some new blood. We may see such an outpouring again. Or we may not. But there is no denying the impact that it made on the film industry. Tarantino, Shyamalan, and many more, including Mr. Singer, started to soar here.But even considering the fact that it was not uncommon for young directors to make great films in this age, it still surprised me to know that this is a Singer movie. Despite the fact that this movie drapes itself with mythology and fiction at every corner, it is still ostensibly a 'real' movie. I did not expect it to come from the man most synonymous with the X-Men films. Yes, said films have more 'real' elements than a standard superhero story and yes, going from grounded films early in a career to more fantastical ones later in a career is commonplace... but these films don't even stylistically look like they were directed by the same person. Singer would make a good chameleon.I do admit, though, that such is only one of these reasons I didn't make the connection. This film is spectacularly artistic. It sweeps you vividly into this distorted world of Kevin Spacey's thoughts as he tells of a story centered around the notorious criminal mastermind, Keyser Soze. As much as I love the X-Men films, could hardly imagine Singer directed a film of this cinematic quality now, let alone when he was thirty.McQuarrie, who wrote the script at only twenty-seven, also shows talents well beyond anything that could be reasonably expected. It is one of the best scripts of the decade and one that deserves to be gone into. So we shall.If I had to name the one greatest feature of the script as a whole, it would be its ability to guide you while misguiding you. Unless you are Roger Ebert, you never feel that it is isn't providing enough information. But it still manages to make you jump to entirely faulty conclusions. It's like you are watching a play and you occasionally hear noise behind the stage. But every time you get ready to get up from your seat and check it out, the play draws you back in, as if it has some psychic hold on you.Even before I watched this movie, I knew what the twist was. In case you don't know, I won't spoil it, though you really should know it whether or not you've watched this film. Just saying. Anyway, because I knew this twist was coming, I paid attention to how they set it up. I expected excellence and I got near-perfection. This film does a sterling job of making you think that you don't know what will happen, thus allowing the big reveal to strike you at an even deeper place in your heart. I was almost questioning who it was for a second, imagining that the whole world lied to me like parents do about Santa Claus.Ahh.. fond memories.From a technical standpoint, few films are better. The soundtrack is impressively foreboding. The characters are more than fleshed out enough to let the film work its magic. The cinematography is breathtaking. Two scenes come to mind. One is the scene where the group of criminals that comprises most of the main cast find the body of one their own down by the sea. The second is, of course, the saturated scene where Soze's backstory is 'explained' and Spacey famously says 'The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing people he didn't exist', words that are repeated at this film's climax.But it is to some extent pointless to technically discuss this film. The whole is worth more than the sum of its parts. I consider a great movie to be that can offer something to me that no other medium can, one that deserves to be watched. This film fulfills that.

The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), one of the most famous science fiction films ever made, needs no introduction. Even if you're not the biggest filmfreak you'll know without a doubt that it was directed by the one and only Mr. Steven Spielberg. Upon its release date in 1982 the world fell in love with this oddly creature from outer-space. Not that it matters much, but even Lady Diana and Ronald Reagan were moved to tears after seeing this film. But what were those secret ingredients that made E.T. as unforgettable as it turned out to be?Spielberg takes us on a trip in an American suburban development. Out in the wilderness a spaceship lands at night, with odd-looking creatures taking what seems to be samples of trees and plants. After being startled by humans the creatures depart again into outer-space. There is just one problem, they forgot one of their friends, E.T. Without spoiling too much of the script E.T. befriends a little boy named Elliott and an adventure for both little 'men' begins. Our hero in this particular film, besides E.T., is in the human form of Elliott who's played by Henry Thomas, a now former child actor who gives an extraordinary performance. The strength of his performance lies in the fact that it comes across as very natural and childlike. What Thomas feeds his character is something rarely seen around child-actors in Hollywood films. Upon watching E.T again, for probably the 20th time or so, it becomes clear that this film tells much more than just the story about a little boy befriending an Extra-Terrestrial. In its essence E.T. deals about friendship and love. The sequential story develops the back-story of our little creature, the personality of Elliott, the relationships between the humans and so on. All of this is told in a fluently manner that makes us, as viewers, involved in what is actually a creature created by special effects. We empathize in the friendship between Elliott and E.T, sometimes with tears and sometimes with laughs. E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial is a film that drives on a stream of different emotions throughout its entire runtime and Spielberg serves us just the right amount of these emotional ingredients. The film has moments of childlike innocence and hope, funny and exciting moments and a sequence that's so tear-dropping even Conan the Barbarian with blow his nose during the end credits. In the end E.T. is one of the most remarkable characters ever created in Modern Cinema and a film that ,like fine wine, only gets better with age.

So, I watched his two most iconic films, Scream and this film. If I had to choose a favorite, it'd probably be Scream, but I still adored this film, even though it has a few flaws.The main flaw, in my opinion, is that, when a character dies at the beginning of the film and Nancy goes to school, nobody's talking about it or acknowledging it in any way at all. I mean, a student at this school is found brutally killed and nobody seems to really care? I mean, in Scream the school made a pretty big deal at the murder of another student. It also seemed to get a little goofy when Nancy set up booby traps and they attacked Freddy. However, the film does seem to have a little bit of humorous and, as I've heard, the other films in the franchise have way more gags.  However, what DOES work in the film? Practically everything else! The whole film has that classic 80s feel, which is always really enjoyable, the dream sequences are wonderfully surreal and weird, and I was constantly engaged throughout the film. It was a really fun, entertaining, interesting, and creative horror film.If you're a big horror fan, than you've probably already seen the film, and if you haven't, than you totally should! It is definitely one of the absolute best horror films I've seen, and I believe, personally, that all of the hype that this film has gotten is very well deserved. Way to go, Wes Craven!

So, I watched his two most iconic films, Scream and this film. If I had to choose a favorite, it'd probably be Scream, but I still adored this film, even though it has a few flaws.The main flaw, in my opinion, is that, when a character dies at the beginning of the film and Nancy goes to school, nobody's talking about it or acknowledging it in any way at all.
