One got the impression from the film that Carrey reacted as we might expect a Bishop or a Cardinal to react when told he is to play the Pope. Carrey's reverence for Kaufman shines through in every aspect of an incredibly deep, Oscar-worthy performance.Carrey overshadows what is actually a very strong cast. Danny DeVito (George Shapiro) plays Andy's agent, and since those two actors worked together for years on Taxi, DeVito's personal history with Andy bolstered his ability to grasp the role. Shapiro is written as a man caught between a one-of-a-kind artist and the establishment attempting to profit from him by fitting him into their little box, a box Andy not only thought, but lived outside of.Courtney Love (Lynne Margulies) was well-suited for her role as Andy's wife, much as she was suited for People vs. Larry Flynt. Her energy and feistiness made her believable as the one woman who could handle the man no one else ever could. Paul Giamatti (Bob Zmuda) is Andy's best friend and co-conspirator, and has gone on to much bigger and better things after an excellent performance here. Appearances are made by most of the rest of the cast of Taxi (except for Tony Danza), while other figures in the movie have their real-life versions blending in with the crowd, such as George Shapiro as a club owner who fires Andy, Lynne Margulies as one of the mourners at the funeral.

Why, why oh why have I done this thing? Friday the 13th The Final Chapter was a rather optimistic title for a film that turned out to be only the fourth segment in a seemingly endless series. The films repeat the same scenario over and over with all the affection and creativity of a washing machine. In fact, I suggest that all of the Ft13th films are so routine that they can be compared to doing your laundry.The presoak cycle is when we get either a recap of the previous films (which conveniently pads out the abbreviated runtime) or a murder. Or both. In Friday the 13th The Final Chapter, we get both an unchronological series of images recaptures some of the gory murders from the previous films, followed by a couple of new murders when Jason's body is taken to a local hospital's morgue.Then comes the main wash. That's when we meet a bunch of new characters that we don't care about; we know they are only there to get murdered by Jason, and any conversations they have are boring and ridiculous, as a rule. A number of obligatory menace shots are required during the main wash, usually point-of-view shots of Jason watching the characters from afar. This is so we know they are in danger, you see, because otherwise we would not know this. The Final Chapter gives us a young Corey Feldman to root for, as well as Crispin Glover doing a very funny dance. Everybody else is pretty much anonymous and stayed that way.The rinse cycle comes as Jason unceremoniously executes the entire cast in various ways, usually in scenes that require him to be hiding in places where he would undoubtedly be detected by anybody with a functioning brain and at least two of their five senses intact (under the bed is a favorite in these movies, a vantage point from which the killer is able to tell exactly when a drop of blood will fall on his victim from the corpse that has been stashed in the rafters or top bunk above the bed). Watch out for the spin cycle, where a harrowing chase scene happens, usually with the one last female who has proved to be a little harder to kill.Friday the 13th The Final Chapter tries to bring something new to the folding table by setting it up that not only does a teenage girl face off with Jason, but her little brother (Feldman) is along for the ride. And how does he help defeat Mr. Hockey Mask? By shaving his head and making himself resemble the childhood image of Jason, naturally. This mesmerizes Jason long enough for someone to attack him with a machete.Tom Savini, the original effects artist who created the gory murders in the first film, returns on this one, but there isn't anything that memorable about the murders themselves. The acting is mostly abysmal, and when it isn't, the dialogue in the script makes it ridiculous anyway. There aren't many scenes that will make you jump, and not much atmosphere, either. It will quite possibly make you laugh, like the inconceivably surreal moment when Feldman appears with his head shaved bald. You might also find yourself frustrated by the gratuitous lack of logic, like the scene where one character would rather toss a chair out of a window and climb out that way instead of stepping over a body on the front porch. I understand some people are squeamish about dead bodies, but when a psycho killer with a machete is coming after you, it's probably best to just get the hell out of the house.Fans of the series should not be disappointed, but Friday the 13th The Final Chapter made me want to stick my head in the dryer.

This was more annoying than useful and served no purpose as it adds nothing to the over-all story.

There are many moments, such as the scarcity of food we currently take for granted, and the lack of decent living accommodations, seen mostly via the day-to-day existence of the main characters (Chuck Heston as a cop, Ed Robinson as his 'book,' Taylor-Young as 'furniture' - notice how certain people are referred to as things), that shows someone took time to work out the details through educated guesswork.I also liked the entire atmosphere of the film - the city is continually sweltering under a greenhouse effect out of control so everyone sweats. Though it's the future, there are no flying cars or similar advanced technology; indeed, the have-nots seem to just content themselves with hand-me-downs from past decades - witness the quaint little TV set in Heston's character's apartment.

It was the first film in which he had a substantial role behind the camera. My guess is that he must have lobbied Herbert J. Yates at Republic films for some creative control and Yates gave in to his studio's biggest moneymaker. Though Wayne at times didn't have the best judgment in regard to his own personal projects, The Angel and the Badman is a winner in every way and doesn't get near enough credit for the work it is except from Wayne partisans. Wayne plays young gun hand Quirt Evans, a most feared man in the territory, who wounded falls in the hands of a Quaker family who nurses him back to health. Wayne starts eying pretty daughter Gail Russell.Pretty soon under her influence Wayne starts questioning the direction his life's been going in. Of course the Quakers do cheat a little on this question themselves. Though they don't believe in violence, the Duke's reputation as a gun hand comes in mighty handy in settling at least one neighborly dispute with Paul Hurst.My favorite scene in the film and one of Wayne's best in all his films also involves his reputation. When Bruce Cabot and two henchmen find him at the Quaker home, Wayne runs one terrific bluff holding them off with an empty gun. This was the first time Wayne and Cabot worked together. In the sixties Cabot became a regular in Wayne films.Angel and the Badman also has two other Wayne attempted reclamation projects. Gail Russell was one of the most beautiful women ever on the silver screen. She had a lot of tragedy in her life and died young. Wayne at one point gave her the lead in a film Seven Men from Now that he was producing, but not starring in, with Randolph Scott. She gave a good performance, but a lot of substance abuse had taken its toll.Paul Hurst later on got a pay day from Wayne in Big Jim McLain in a scene he portrayed from a wheelchair. He was terminally ill with cancer and in fact took his own life shortly afterwards. The money was no doubt needed for Hurst's medical expenses. Later on in McLintock Wayne said in one scene he doesn't give jobs, he hires men (and women). This was his idea of charity and something that never gets talked about enough by people, even some of Wayne's most devoted fans.As this was his first film as producer, I have no doubt that the Duke wanted Harry Carey, the man he patterned his cowboy image after in this film. One of Carey's best screen performances as the patient federal marshal who's waiting for Cabot and Wayne to shoot it out so he can hang the winner. Wayne's good friend James Edward Grant wrote and directed the film. Later on Frank Capra disparaged Grant as a bad influence on Wayne when they quarreled during the filming of Circus World.

However, Ed starts to realise it was a bad idea and he eventually finds out that conjuring up this demon comes at a price. Oh hail, B-legend Lance Henriksen! It's Henriksen's burning conviction and special effects whiz Stan Winston's masterful monster design that lifts this B-grade monster feature out of the very ordinary mould. I can see why those factors get highly praised. Pretty much it's typical 80s horror fodder, but on that point I found this minor piece be an enthralling backwoods shocker that's effectively creepy and ominous in its set-up. The atmospheric air just has that feel of the old style monster flicks. I found it to be a vivid treasure in that department with the empty woodlands being so chillingly, foreboding in presence. The dread of it all just swallows you up! Especially the glum conclusion. The night scenes are sensationally staged with very classy touches with the moon's rays shinning through, swirling mists and the shades of blues flood the screen with great impact. Director Stan Winston (making his debut) utilizes the scenery with skillful execution by giving the film such an organic feel and producing some blinding images within some eerie and thrilling set-pieces (the transformation scene being one). Chiming in also is that of the score which creaks an unsteady terror with it's alienating chords. I thought the dark feel and slick look of the film is perfect and that's rightfully so. Though, it's not without its flaws. The main one being the scratchy writing with it being riddled with clichés, loose characters and repetition. The premise and feeble script could have done with a polish up, because the urban legend of this rural demon does make for an interesting viewing. Thrown up in the story are some thoughtful questions and a emotional edge, but still it was kinda lacking. The stock characters are reasonably an unlikeable bunch, but thank goodness Lance Henriksen gives out a powerful and hypnotic performance that you totally feel his hurt. While, the rest of the cast were modest even if their characters are vague as can be and had very little to work with. Now the other star of the film was the magnificent, but horrific looking demon that's simply grand in stature and hands out punishment with such ease by toying around with it's victims in such a cruel manner. Death scenes might be brutal, but if you want some gore out of those moments&#133; there is some bad news. There ain't any. Some blood, but no gore. But if you're looking for some suspense leading up to the kills it seems to mishandle those moments by being very foreseeable. Pacing wise the film is solid even though after the intense beginning it seems to stall for a while, well that's until Pumpkinhead reappears and things really do get going with it's quest for relentless horror. A solid and creative effort overall that relishes from it's visually brooding direction, superior lead performance and convincing monster design.

Chiming in also is that of the score which creaks an unsteady terror with it's alienating chords. I thought the dark feel and slick look of the film is perfect and that's rightfully so. Though, it's not without its flaws. The main one being the scratchy writing with it being riddled with clichés, loose characters and repetition. The premise and feeble script could have done with a polish up, because the urban legend of this rural demon does make for an interesting viewing. Thrown up in the story are some thoughtful questions and a emotional edge, but still it was kinda lacking. The stock characters are reasonably an unlikeable bunch, but thank goodness Lance Henriksen gives out a powerful and hypnotic performance that you totally feel his hurt. While, the rest of the cast were modest even if their characters are vague as can be and had very little to work with. Now the other star of the film was the magnificent, but horrific looking demon that's simply grand in stature and hands out punishment with such ease by toying around with it's victims in such a cruel manner. Death scenes might be brutal, but if you want some gore out of those moments&#133; there is some bad news. There ain't any. Some blood, but no gore. But if you're looking for some suspense leading up to the kills it seems to mishandle those moments by being very foreseeable. Pacing wise the film is solid even though after the intense beginning it seems to stall for a while, well that's until Pumpkinhead reappears and things really do get going with it's quest for relentless horror. A solid and creative effort overall that relishes from it's visually brooding direction, superior lead performance and convincing monster design.

Macy....Director Jeannot Szwarc, Screenplay Richard Matheson, Based On The Novel By Richard Matheson.The man of my dreams has almost faded now. The one I have created in my mind. The sort of man each woman dreams of, in the deepest and most secret reaches of her heart. I can almost see him now before me. What would I say to him if he were really here? Forgive me. I have never known this feeling. I have lived without it all my life. Is it any wonder, then, I failed to recognize you? You, who brought it to me for the first time. Is there any way that I can tell you how my life has changed? Any way at all to let you know what sweetness you have given me? There is so much to say. I cannot find the words. Except for these I love you.Released in 1980, director Jeanot Szwarc's film adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel is a breathtaking, emotionally stirring romantic love story with a sci-fi twist the lovers are from different time periods he from the 1972 and she from 1912. Initially a failure at the box office (possibly because Christopher Reeves was preferred to be seen as Superman, this film was only one of his films that year, the other being Super Man Part 2 and because it was difficult to adapt the complex, sci-fi romance into a film without sacrificing some logic, plot consistency and other aspects) it soon acquired a huge fan base. Chris Reeves takes off his Superman outfit and dons an Edwardian gentleman's suite in the role of playwright Richard Collier, who becomes obscessed with the enigmatic turn-of-the century actress Elise McKenna, whose haunting portrait is hung on the Grand Hotel's historic room. After the premiere of his 1970's Vietnam play Too Much Spring, an elderly woman (Susan French) hands him a watch, looks him in the eye like she's known him all her life and says Come back to me. This is what he does when he wills himself back to 1912 (the year Titanic sank) to the Grand Hotel where a young Elise (Jane Seymour in a great role) is performing a play. Seymour's portrayal of this character is effortless, channeling the spirit of the actual 19th century actress that inspired the character of Elise Maude Addams. Seymour looks gorgeous in every one of her costumes and acts the part of a woman who rejects a great career in acting for love, quite well. Christopher Plummer (Sound Of Music), older though he is, is terrific as William Fawcett Robinson, Elise's Svengali, imperious and controlling theater manager, determined to make her a big star and has a professional relationship with her but who deep down, loves her but loses to the young newcomer. In this aspect, this film mirrors 1948's The Red Shoes but with its time\/memories\/love theme and similar time period also resembles 1997's Titanic. Look for William H. Macy in the minor role of a theater critic. I can see how when it was released in 1980, it was considered a bit of a flop. There are plot holes due to the fact a lot of the novel's material was omitted from the film. There is the general confusion with the time travel aspect. Collier is a man of the 70's and then travels to 1912, but Elise had been told by her manager that he'd come and take her away, but she is also an old lady in the 70's, magically drawing him to come back to her through whatever she read in an old time travel book. Truthfully, the romance happens much too quickly and is over far too quickly. The dialog is nothing Oscar worthy, so contrived and stilted, the characters are not too well-developed but what makes this film so enjoyable is the romantic escapism. The audience is required to suspend disbelief. There is genuine chemistry between Reeves and Seymour. It's refreshing to see Christopher Reeves in a non-Superman performance. Many consider THIS performance as a romantic playwright to be his best role. He himself was very proud of this performance. This is a maudlin, escapist romantic movie, even if short, and the cinematography is exquisite, resembling an Impressionist painting and evoking a romanticized past. The hotel is luxurious and Victorian and the costumes and music are striking. Especially spiritual are such scenes as when Reeves first looks at Elise's portrait in the History Gallery of the Hotel, a portrait cast in natural sunlight. Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody On A Theme of Paganini 18th Variation Andante Cantabile features prominently and serves as the love theme. All romantics at heart and lovers of a good romance will love this movie. It is still one of those underrated love stories that deserve more recognition. It was Christopher Reeve's favorite film and perhaps he is still watching it in Heaven.

But the novelty wore off very quickly. The idea of this entire film series is just so retarded that it only keeps getting worse and worse. The original and its sequel had a morbid energy that made it easy to overlook how silly the story was. They were also somewhat scary. After that, it was clear exactly what was going to happen in each movie nothing. People would wander off alone, get murdered, and eventually a showdown would happen. Now this.I presume it was with a sense of humor that the filmmakers introduced their film at the Crystal Lake Research Facility, where the 'notorious' Jason Voorhees is being prepared for freezing. The young female heroine of the film admits that attempts with electrocution, gas, guns, and hanging have all failed to kill Jason, so the natural thing to do was cryogenically freeze him. Personally I was wondering why bodily dismemberment followed by cremation was never tried, but then that would be too obvious, I suppose. Jason naturally escapes his bonds and wipes out a small military operation, but our heroine manages to trap him in the freezer anyway. Unfortunately she gets stabbed and then frozen right along with him.Four centuries later (give or take a few years), a crew of students from Earth II arrives on an exploratory voyage, and they resuscitate the pretty frozen girl. They also unfreeze Jason, who is apparently a conduit of pure evil and will never be able to be destroyed. One wonders why pure evil would choose to limit itself to this one body. Aren't there others, and if there are, why haven't we heard of them? Mayhem ensues, this time on a spaceship, and the movie contains only one unique twist instead of containing clichés from slasher films alone, it also contains clichés from the ALIEN series. Woo hoo! Set in outer space, it goes through the motions of Ellen Ripley's saga with Jason standing in for the slimy, metal-toothed antagonists. Remember how silly you felt after watching the abysmal Alien Resurrection? This movie makes that one look like...well, Aliens.I couldn't get over the fact that the movie seems to have been written with morons in mind. For instance, when the frozen chick is thawed out, she is told it's the year 2455. Then she says But, that's 455 years in the future! Later, we watch the spaceship's small defense team get completely wiped out by Jason, and just after he kills the last one, the script points this out for those people who weren't smart enough to keep up with what was going on He killed every one of them! There was one funny sequence where the survivors are trying to make a daring escape and they distract Jason with a virtual reality recreation of Camp Crystal Lake, complete with two nubile girls who invite Jason to smoke some pot with them and engage in premarital sex.Ironically, the most enjoyable thing about the DVD is not the movie itself, but the documentary that was made about its creation. In it, you can see the originators and fans of the series, particularly Sean S. Cunningham, going on and on about the original Friday the 13th as being groundbreaking and influential, an independent movie that went on to make millions and surprised everybody. You never heard of that happening in 1980! they gush, forgetting that in 1978, a movie called Halloween did the same thing they did, except with a lot more style, scares, and quality film-making.I don't know what I was expecting when I watched this, or even why I watched it. When a series has had not one but TWO films that described themselves as the final film of the franchise, clearly nothing that ever happens is going to prevent the ridiculous menace from returning.

But the novelty wore off very quickly. The idea of this entire film series is just so retarded that it only keeps getting worse and worse.

After that, it was clear exactly what was going to happen in each movie nothing. People would wander off alone, get murdered, and eventually a showdown would happen. Now this.I presume it was with a sense of humor that the filmmakers introduced their film at the Crystal Lake Research Facility, where the 'notorious' Jason Voorhees is being prepared for freezing. The young female heroine of the film admits that attempts with electrocution, gas, guns, and hanging have all failed to kill Jason, so the natural thing to do was cryogenically freeze him. Personally I was wondering why bodily dismemberment followed by cremation was never tried, but then that would be too obvious, I suppose. Jason naturally escapes his bonds and wipes out a small military operation, but our heroine manages to trap him in the freezer anyway. Unfortunately she gets stabbed and then frozen right along with him.Four centuries later (give or take a few years), a crew of students from Earth II arrives on an exploratory voyage, and they resuscitate the pretty frozen girl. They also unfreeze Jason, who is apparently a conduit of pure evil and will never be able to be destroyed. One wonders why pure evil would choose to limit itself to this one body. Aren't there others, and if there are, why haven't we heard of them? Mayhem ensues, this time on a spaceship, and the movie contains only one unique twist instead of containing clichés from slasher films alone, it also contains clichés from the ALIEN series. Woo hoo! Set in outer space, it goes through the motions of Ellen Ripley's saga with Jason standing in for the slimy, metal-toothed antagonists. Remember how silly you felt after watching the abysmal Alien Resurrection? This movie makes that one look like...well, Aliens.I couldn't get over the fact that the movie seems to have been written with morons in mind. For instance, when the frozen chick is thawed out, she is told it's the year 2455. Then she says But, that's 455 years in the future! Later, we watch the spaceship's small defense team get completely wiped out by Jason, and just after he kills the last one, the script points this out for those people who weren't smart enough to keep up with what was going on He killed every one of them! There was one funny sequence where the survivors are trying to make a daring escape and they distract Jason with a virtual reality recreation of Camp Crystal Lake, complete with two nubile girls who invite Jason to smoke some pot with them and engage in premarital sex.Ironically, the most enjoyable thing about the DVD is not the movie itself, but the documentary that was made about its creation. In it, you can see the originators and fans of the series, particularly Sean S. Cunningham, going on and on about the original Friday the 13th as being groundbreaking and influential, an independent movie that went on to make millions and surprised everybody. You never heard of that happening in 1980! they gush, forgetting that in 1978, a movie called Halloween did the same thing they did, except with a lot more style, scares, and quality film-making.I don't know what I was expecting when I watched this, or even why I watched it. When a series has had not one but TWO films that described themselves as the final film of the franchise, clearly nothing that ever happens is going to prevent the ridiculous menace from returning.

A number of reviewers have said it about Skipped Parts. So I'm wondering what the Religious Right really would think of this film if they examined it seriously.First, the storyline suggests that sex education for kids is not a good thing and may have unwanted consequences. The women who give the advice, Lydia and Delores, are pretty unsympathetic characters when they're talking to the adolescents. Are we meant to applaud the way they give explicit details (complete with taco shell, like a silly pantomime of a sex ed class) to 14-year-olds, while withholding the key point of where this might lead? I don't think so, because their recklessness is part of a commonplace theme that runs through the film - the kids are more sensible than the adults - and also because we're shown those consequences later. Lydia and Delores might as well give Sam and Maurey a hand grenade and tell them to play carefully. So score a point for Religious Right family values here.Second, the film doesn't take the view of abortion that the Religious Right might expect from so called Hollywood liberals. It doesn't present it as a quick and relatively painless way out of a jam, nor does it do any pulpit pounding about the dark days before Roe v Wade. The film could have made Lydia and Delores into proto-feminist heroes, enlightened before their time, but it didn't. In the story, there are two consequences of visiting the abortion clinic and neither one is a guilt free abortion. So score some big points for family values.Third, the film ends by affirming the stereotypical woman-man-girl-boy family the waitress, the Indian, the cheerleader, and the precocious young narrator. Sure, the narrator and the cheerleader have a baby, and the waitress is a grandmother before she's thirty. But unless the Religious Right has recently come out against grandchildren being raised by multi- generational families, I fail to see the problem. So what's there to offend the RR, other than the portrayal of Wyoming natives as rodeo loving illiterates? (And that's only offensive &#150;probably -if you're from Wyoming.) Well, there's the scene where the two young teens face each other in their underwear, saying something like, I think this is how it's done. It was uncomfortable and strange. But a lot of reviewers found it creepy, and I'm sure not all are card-carrying members of the 700 Club. And it doesn't change the fundamental themes of the story outlined above.Lydia's loose morals and rebelliousness are sure to offend the Religious Right, right? Yes, because her actions are *meant* to be offensive her irresponsible talk, her rambling, self- indulgent rudeness to the welcome lady, her inability to do a stick of work, her cruelty to a man who's much too good for her. The RR is offended and so is everyone else. So maybe, in the movies, actions shouldn't always be judged desirable if they offend conservative Christians. Even the RR is sometimes offended by what's actually offensive. But I digress. The good news is that, as in all traditional morality tales, Lydia comes round in the end. She gets a job, declares independence (rather than just rebellion) from her father, and settles down with a man who loves her. Sure, she's white and he's Native American, but not even the film's illiterate Wyomians are offended by that. That leaves just one theme that seems custom made to offend conservative religious types. The film threatens to undermine parental authority and traditional family values by making the kids more sensible and moral than the adults. In fact, the grown ups are mostly first class hypocrites, as revealed especially in the confrontation at the abortion clinic. Sam, on the other hand, is an example of responsibility and kindness. But wait. I think I've read that somewhere before. Something about religious leaders being blind Pharisees and children being the kingdom of heaven.

Thousands were killed in fighting so brutal that over the bodies 1500 men were blown to bits or swept out to sea and were never recovered.

German Field Marshall Erwin Rommel was said to have called D-Day, the longest day of the century.

More isn't necessarily better but in this case it's pretty good. It runs long at three hours and has it's flaws but well worth the time and some memorable screen moments.

It of course is the story of Decision Day better known as D-Day, June 6, 1944 and the allied invasion of Normany setting in motion a chain of events that would lead to the end of the war in Europe 10 months later. 2,700 ships carrying 176,000 soldiers land on the heavily fortified German controlled beaches of Normandy. Thousands were killed in fighting so brutal that over the bodies 1500 men were blown to bits or swept out to sea and were never recovered. In recent years Steven Spielberg chronicled the event in his film Saving Private Ryan. In that film you are put directly into the battle and it's graphic depiction. That film couldn't have been made in 1962 before Vietnam. This film, The Longest Day is more of the overall telling of the day. German Field Marshall Erwin Rommel was said to have called D-Day, the longest day of the century. From that quote author Cornelius Ryan titled his best selling 1959 book from which this film is adapted from. Told in three parts, The Waiting as they prepare the invasion, The Night as the allies prepare it's launch and the Germans prepare their defense and The Day of the invasion. Ryan drafted the screenplay along with Romain Gary, James Jones, David Pursall and Jack Seddan. It took an equal amount of cinematographers to film it led by Jean Bourgin and Walter Wattiz the all-French photographic team included Pierre Levant, Henri Persin and Guy Tabary which won them the Academy Award for Best Black and White Cinematography in the last black and white epic filmed. The film won a second Academy Award for special effects. It was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Art Direction and Best Editing. This film was producer Darryl F. Zannuck's pet project and he claimed to have directed much of it although uncredited in that role he obviously oversaw it's production and it's use of multiple directors to have so many directors turn out a seamless production. Principal directors Ken Annakin and Andrew Marton are supplemented with director Bernard Wicki and second unit directors Gerd Oswald and Elmo Williams in addition to six assistant directors.

It is just wonderful to be able to relate to the problems in this family, and then seeing them getting resolved. Billy is a revelation - I love grandma !! All that background story about the mines and the comedy that's in it - then the sudden break-down of Dad - is so real-life. I wasn't the least bit surprised to see the little, sissy boy in there - and thought Billy was a champ the way he handled it. The ballet-teacher was a female drag-queen, and wonderful.....I wonder if she picked-up her daughter was hot for Billy? The whole story was so full of every-day happenings, but the grandest theme and point made was the total turn-around by Dad. I had the greatest empathy with him when they went to the ballet-school. He knew he was way out-of-place, but stuck to his plan to do the best he could by a son he didn't truly understand.As others have written, the ending was so appropriate - the sissy all grown-up with her lover and in drag, and those two macho miners not the least bit bothered. To have Billy be the star in Bourne's Swan Lake was a shocker - but should have been expected. How many Americans do you think have seen that ballet ? This kind of movie tears me up, because they are so real - keep them coming ! Double-bravo to all - ","genre":null},{"date":"16 May 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I'm so happy to see so many people love this movie - to me, it is a textbook for overly-spoiled American kids.
