Alex them wakes up & realises it was a dream like vision, he becomes freaked out when the events which happened in his vision happen in real life & after causing a large commotion he along with several of his classmates are thrown off the plane before it takes off. They are left in the departure lounge as the plane takes off, then they all witness it as it blows up in mid air killing everyone aboard just like in Alex's vision. Those who walked off the plane try to get on with their lives but start to die under mysterious circumstances leading Alex to believe that death has come back to claim those he saved...Co-written & directed by James Wong I have to say I thought Final Destination when it originally came out was a breath of fresh air for the horror genre which was producing boring unimaginative teen crap for years like they were coming off on a production line, at the time I originally saw it at the cinema I genuinely thought Final Destination tried to be something that bit different yet still gave horror fans what they wanted. The script by Wong, producer Glen Morgan & Jeffrey Reddick was apparently based on a potential The X-Files (1993 - 2002) episode & I must admit I loved the idea behind it, I thought it was clever, fun & made a great central premise for killing off teens in spectacular ways. The character's are good considering their clichéd American teen origins, the dialogue is good with it's plot explained just about enough to make sense without going overboard & at less than 100 minutes it moves along like a rocket with some extremely satisfying & clever set-pieces. The film also has a healthy respect for the genre & there are lots of homages & references to other genre films including naming the cast after old horror stars & director's, Valerie Lewton anyone? Of course it's not perfect & I'm not trying to say it is, while they are OK the character's are just faceless teens when all said & done, the mortician character is just very out-of-place, one could say it's a touch silly & the set-pieces go from sinister & clever acts which conspire to dispense of a character to overblown full on ghostly events like possessed electric cables, exploding cars & entire house's blowing up & some of it's own rules are broken as if Alex wasn't the next victim because he never actually changed seats why did death try to kill him when he was at the cabin before Carter who was as it is revealed the next victim? Still, I'll leave the nit picking to the monkeys because I just thought it was a highly entertaining & pretty original teen horror flick with a good story & decent gore.Director Wong does a good job & the film is very stylish & great to look at although I'm coming off the back of a terrible run of zero budget shot on a digital camcorder crap that makes something that looks this good an absolute god send. There's a lot of visual gags here, I loved the prevailing sense of doom at the airport with the informations boards displaying words like 'departed' & 'terminal'! Plus there's a John Denver song playing in the airport toilets &, of course, he died in a plane crash! I was more than pleased to see the makers haven't skipped on the gore either, there's decapitations, hangings, embalming's, stabbings, broken glass in necks, someone gets splattered by a bus in a great scene & there's plenty of blood splashed around. The film has a nice eerie tension & has a few genuine jumpy scare moments.With a supposed budget of about $23,000,000 this is very well made, the CGI effects are decent although not perfect while the make-up effects are very good. The film is set in a south New York but was shot in British Columbia in Canada. The acting is pretty good from a recognisable & good looking teenage cast, horror regular Tony Todd makes a small & somewhat pointless cameo.Final Destination is, in my humble opinion, one of the finest teen horror popcorn flicks this millennium & it's as simple & straight forward as that.

That factoid right there sets up a dynamic wherein people are either going to love this movie or hate this movie, based strictly on how Lenny strikes them. Some find humor in this guy, but others do not. Many are off-put. So off-put, in fact, that they can't get past it. In that way I would compare this 1972 film to a more contemporary one, Sideways (2004). In Sideways the main characters, Jack in particular (played by Thomas Haden Church), were so personally offensive, in word, in thought, and in deed, that many people intensely disliked the movie solely on that basis. People say to me, I hated Sideways. I ask them why and they say, I couldn't stand Jack. Some perspective is called for here. The viewer is supposed to dislike Jack in Sideways. That was intended. Maybe find him a little entertaining --or not-- but disliking him is the intended effect. Likewise here with Lenny in The Heartbreak Kid. We are supposed to dislike Lenny. We can laugh at him too if we want to, and he is funny, but disapproval and repulsion is the intent.At the very least Lenny's actions make most people just plain awkwardly uncomfortable. The movie thereby evokes certain feelings and emotions in the viewer that aren't often evoked by movies, which, all by itself, makes this movie unique. As a work of art it makes it a success. And that's just the superficiality of it. There's more to it than just that. Bruce Jay Friedman, the writer, and Neil Simon, the director, were actually making some much deeper ethnic observations and social commentary here. Commentary about Jews, about Jews and Jewish culture in modern America, about Gentiles too, and about how Jews and Gentiles interact in that modern America. All that. But mostly the observations and commentary was about the condition of young Jewish men (some of the very same turf that was being plowed by novelist Philip Roth in about the same era as this movie was released). Lenny, the character played by Grodin, is the almost stereo-typical young angst-filled Jewish male, desperate to break out from the box of tradition which was preordained for him, and who rubbishes his very Jewish bride on their honeymoon to lust after a very Gentile blond, Cybil Shepherd as Kelly Corcoran, all as a part of that angst condition. The Corcoran family, meanwhile, presenting themselves as the cold, aloof uptight WASPs.Friedman had a lot to say here. Simon executed it well. Probably among Simon's best work, although not ever really recognized as such. A remake with Ben Stiller in the Lenny role is now in the works, soon in the offing. We'll have to see if they improve upon the original. I have my doubts that they can even come close. While not perfect, the original is a good movie. But perhaps the time for this story has passed. It was relevant, pertinent, and apropos for 1972. Not so sure about that in 2007. Not to disparage Ben Stiller, but the underlying themes of this movie wouldn't mean as much today as it did 35 years ago.Grodin and Shepherd give good performances. Eddie Albert did too. I heard Cybil say in an interview not all that long ago that she always wished they'd done a sequel to it, and that she was still open to the possibility.

In that way I would compare this 1972 film to a more contemporary one, Sideways (2004). In Sideways the main characters, Jack in particular (played by Thomas Haden Church), were so personally offensive, in word, in thought, and in deed, that many people intensely disliked the movie solely on that basis. People say to me, I hated Sideways. I ask them why and they say, I couldn't stand Jack. Some perspective is called for here. The viewer is supposed to dislike Jack in Sideways. That was intended. Maybe find him a little entertaining --or not-- but disliking him is the intended effect. Likewise here with Lenny in The Heartbreak Kid. We are supposed to dislike Lenny. We can laugh at him too if we want to, and he is funny, but disapproval and repulsion is the intent.At the very least Lenny's actions make most people just plain awkwardly uncomfortable. The movie thereby evokes certain feelings and emotions in the viewer that aren't often evoked by movies, which, all by itself, makes this movie unique. As a work of art it makes it a success. And that's just the superficiality of it. There's more to it than just that. Bruce Jay Friedman, the writer, and Neil Simon, the director, were actually making some much deeper ethnic observations and social commentary here. Commentary about Jews, about Jews and Jewish culture in modern America, about Gentiles too, and about how Jews and Gentiles interact in that modern America. All that. But mostly the observations and commentary was about the condition of young Jewish men (some of the very same turf that was being plowed by novelist Philip Roth in about the same era as this movie was released). Lenny, the character played by Grodin, is the almost stereo-typical young angst-filled Jewish male, desperate to break out from the box of tradition which was preordained for him, and who rubbishes his very Jewish bride on their honeymoon to lust after a very Gentile blond, Cybil Shepherd as Kelly Corcoran, all as a part of that angst condition. The Corcoran family, meanwhile, presenting themselves as the cold, aloof uptight WASPs.Friedman had a lot to say here. Simon executed it well. Probably among Simon's best work, although not ever really recognized as such. A remake with Ben Stiller in the Lenny role is now in the works, soon in the offing. We'll have to see if they improve upon the original. I have my doubts that they can even come close. While not perfect, the original is a good movie. But perhaps the time for this story has passed. It was relevant, pertinent, and apropos for 1972. Not so sure about that in 2007. Not to disparage Ben Stiller, but the underlying themes of this movie wouldn't mean as much today as it did 35 years ago.Grodin and Shepherd give good performances. Eddie Albert did too. I heard Cybil say in an interview not all that long ago that she always wished they'd done a sequel to it, and that she was still open to the possibility. Very much worth seeing before one sees any remaking of it.

But I know it's mentioned quite a bit because of the Quentin Tarantino fans out there, so when I came across the film in Hollywood Video, I didn't hesitate. Also not to mention that we have a few stars in the film besides Quentin, we have George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, and Juliette Lewis. So I just watched the film and while I think the story had a complete turn around, we went from a hostage\/robbers story to a vampire horror story. It happened so quickly that I was a bit out of it after the film, but at the same time I really enjoyed the action. It was unbelievable, I'm not just talking about the vampires alone, I'm just saying how the family knew automatically to use weapons. Well, there are a few things, but I'll explain in a minute.Seth and Richie are two brothers who are robbers and killers, they are on the run to Mexico. They kidnap a family with their motor home van and cross the border. There Seth wants to meet a friend that can get him started with the money that him and his brother robbed from a bank, they decide to meet at the local strip club that is open from dusk till dawn. There Seth, Richie, the family end up getting something a bit out of their league and what they expected, vampires, and they're hungry for some blood.The acting is alright, enough to get by as believable, I mean, don't get me wrong, the cast was awesome, but it was a bit of a question to me on the roles they took on. While the story is very cool and creative, like I said, it turns so quickly into something else and they also leave with questions. This wasn't Quentin's best work, but I liked this movie better than Jackie Brown. I would recommend this movie for horror fans, because I know every Quentin Tarantino fan has already seen this film.

Some good and some bad, but it was one of those films you had to pay attention to every second, so I was a bit worried. Just because I felt like for a minute if this was going to be one of those films that I had to watch several times to get. But I watched it last night and I was really impressed, this movie had everything in it action, drama, sci-fi, history, dark humor, and even a little romance. The actors all did a terrific job, I give a lot of credit to Bruce, during his scene in the car with his psychiatrist, he really got to me. But Brad Pitt, I'm just amazed with how much of a great job he did. He didn't over do his character, who was crazy, and just made it work and was extremely believable. The story was just scary, but very good and a wake up call.James Cole is a man in the future where a virus broke out in the past and killed 5 billion people and only 1% of the population survived including him. Animals are now ruling the ground above while the humans are down below, but scientists send James to the past of 1990(really meaning to send him to '96), to find out about information of the virus. James gets put into a mental institution meeting his new psychiatrist, Dr. Kathryn Raily and another mental patient, Jeffrey Goines. He tells them the future, of course no one believes him, he goes back to the future. But the scientists send him back to the correct year to where the doctor is kidnapped by James, but he tells her more, and believes him. Now they are set on trying to prevent the virus from ever happening.12 Monkeys was an incredible film. Like I said the story was so scary just because it's not at all hard to believe that we are not far from that happening.

Some good and some bad, but it was one of those films you had to pay attention to every second, so I was a bit worried. Just because I felt like for a minute if this was going to be one of those films that I had to watch several times to get. But I watched it last night and I was really impressed, this movie had everything in it action, drama, sci-fi, history, dark humor, and even a little romance. The actors all did a terrific job, I give a lot of credit to Bruce, during his scene in the car with his psychiatrist, he really got to me. But Brad Pitt, I'm just amazed with how much of a great job he did. He didn't over do his character, who was crazy, and just made it work and was extremely believable. The story was just scary, but very good and a wake up call.James Cole is a man in the future where a virus broke out in the past and killed 5 billion people and only 1% of the population survived including him. Animals are now ruling the ground above while the humans are down below, but scientists send James to the past of 1990(really meaning to send him to '96), to find out about information of the virus. James gets put into a mental institution meeting his new psychiatrist, Dr. Kathryn Raily and another mental patient, Jeffrey Goines. He tells them the future, of course no one believes him, he goes back to the future. But the scientists send him back to the correct year to where the doctor is kidnapped by James, but he tells her more, and believes him. Now they are set on trying to prevent the virus from ever happening.12 Monkeys was an incredible film.

There are a lot of little things in The Changeling that wouldn't make it into any movie anymore these days, because people wouldn't buy them.

My daughter watched it first when she was 12 when it first came out. She went on and on about it saying how great it was then in about 1995. She also loved Trading Places. I guess the moral of both of these stories is that the good guys win in the end. I now know what she was talking about. It is a great movie, and I can see why it appeals to women.The movie is set in a prison, with the time old tradition of a close friendship over many years of an innocent young man as the hero and an old lag who knows all the ropes, in this case Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. This is the same formula earlier used in the films The Count of Monte Cristo and An Innocent Man, both films which are highly recommended, if you liked this one.The film, although made in 1994, goes back to a time when good wins out over evil. unfortunately the fashion for a long time in the nineties movies was for bad to win out, as in the Terminator and other movies. The bad guys are as usual the prison boss, The Warder and his Second in Command, the Uniformed Chief Officer. There is a highly unusual twist at the end of the movie, in which the good guys win out. This is a highly improbable situation, but fantasy is allowable in movies. One character of note is that of an old man, played by James Whitmore, who rescues a tiny bird, and nurtures it for years. Thank goodness it doesn't get killed by some other evil person, as usually happens. The old man has to cope with pressures in the outside after he is released.The overarching theme of the movie is one of hope. No matter how bad things get, there is always hope that thing will get better. It also shows that it is possible to have a friendship between black and white people, as the older man, the main character's friend, is a black man. The thing that this movie gave me, is that I can see how wise my daughter already was at 12 years of age, and more importantly, it gives hope and a good philosophy for the rest of my life. I'm sure that it will do the same for those of you who see this movie too.I am unsure as to whether it deserves to be rated the best movie of all time. However movies with hope and goodness as their main themes are generally up there, take Gone With the Wind, Schindler's List and Lord of the Rings as examples of this.

Although some people say that the movie is a little too idealized, director Milos Forman did a great job and delivered a superb masterpiece. In this movie, Woody Harrelson gave his best performance of his entire career. Whether or not he should have won his Oscar nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role, his role will always be remembered as one of his best.Besides the earned Oscar nomination of Woody Harrelson, this movie was also nominated for Best Director. Personally, I think there should have been an Oscar nominations more than the 2 the movie was nominated for. I was stunned by Courtney Love's performance and I wondered why the Academy didn't give her a nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. The way she acts in this movie is just simply amazing and not so easy as it might look like. An Oscar nomination would have been great, but apparently Juliette Binoche, Joan Allen, Lauren Bacall, Barbara Hershey and Marianne Jean-Baptiste did a better job than Courtney Love in the eyes of the Academy.And then there's Edward Norton. In his first movie (Primal Fear) he played an accused man, in his second movie (this one) he played a lawyer. In Primal Fear he made quite an impression with his stunning performance and even managed to get an Oscar nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in his first movie ever. A nomination he definitely earned. And in this case I think it's too bad that an actor can't be nominated for 2 different movies at a time, because to me he deserved to be nominated for The People vs. Larry Flynt too. His role of Alan Isaacman was very convincing, but his role in Primal Fear was indeed more convincing. Edward has got a very impressive career and with the successful movies he already did, he's got a nice future ahead of him.The People vs. Larry Flynt is a movie that has to be seen by everyone. It's almost perfect. Not only does it tell a true story about free speech, it's also a tribute to the real Larry Flynt, who saw this movie and felt honored to be the inspiration of a great cast and crew.

New York educator Joe Clark became infamous around this time for his bat-wielding tactics, and was honored by president Ronald Reagan. Most teen-centric films of the 80's focused on upper-middle-class suburbia, and teens of color were barely seen, if at all. Hollywood soon resurrected the well-meaning teacher confronts the urban dilemma movie, and The Principal was one of them.Starring Saturday Night Live alumnus Jim Belushi, in this film he plays Rick Latimer. In an unnamed city (but filmed in Oakland, CA), Rick is a teacher at a suburban prep school; he's also recently divorced. One evening, while visiting a bar he sees his ex-wife with another man. Drunk and enraged, he harasses the man and vandalizes his car with a baseball bat.After being arrested (it's unclear what charges are filed, if any), Rick is called in by the school board for sanctioning. It is decided that he won't be fired, but instead he'll be promoted only he'll also transferred to Brandel An inner-city high school that has seen its better days.Now the principal of Brandel, Rick shows up on his motorcycle to see gang attacks, kids wandering graffiti-tagged hallways, drug commerce and other vices taking place out in the open.

Aghast, Rick calls an impromptu school assembly, and declares that things will start to change at the school immediately-- only, perpetual senior Victor, a gang leader and defacto boss of the school, will hear none of this, and declares war on Rick and his reform ideas.The Academy Award-winning but underrated Lou Gossett continues to slum it here, as Jake, the head of security. He soon becomes one of Rick's few allies in enforcing law and order at the school. Another ally is Rae Dawn Chong as Ms. Orozco, one of the few teachers who doesn't mind going out of her way to help the kids. There are hints of romance, but they are never followed-up on.An unusually labyrinthine locker room is the setting for the climax of the film, as Rick has a final showdown with Victor and his gang.The film is rife with several stock characters and situations, but as a B-action film, it delivers most of its points effectively.It's amusing to look back at some of Belushi's early vehicles, before his box office status petered out in the early 90's, before his comeback with According to Jim.

","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"15 September 2007","score":"","review":" The Principal was released in 1987. During the 1980's, public schools of many inner-city communities were at a low ebb, with suburban flight and state\/city cost-cutting contributing to the poor conditions. This led to many schools becoming especially vulnerable to gang activity and other crimes. New York educator Joe Clark became infamous around this time for his bat-wielding tactics, and was honored by president Ronald Reagan. Most teen-centric films of the 80's focused on upper-middle-class suburbia, and teens of color were barely seen, if at all. Hollywood soon resurrected the well-meaning teacher confronts the urban dilemma movie, and The Principal was one of them.Starring Saturday Night Live alumnus Jim Belushi, in this film he plays Rick Latimer. In an unnamed city (but filmed in Oakland, CA), Rick is a teacher at a suburban prep school; he's also recently divorced. One evening, while visiting a bar he sees his ex-wife with another man. Drunk and enraged, he harasses the man and vandalizes his car with a baseball bat.After being arrested (it's unclear what charges are filed, if any), Rick is called in by the school board for sanctioning. It is decided that he won't be fired, but instead he'll be promoted only he'll also transferred to Brandel An inner-city high school that has seen its better days.Now the principal of Brandel, Rick shows up on his motorcycle to see gang attacks, kids wandering graffiti-tagged hallways, drug commerce and other vices taking place out in the open. The teachers there are ambivalent and mostly resigned to the sub-standard conditions. Aghast, Rick calls an impromptu school assembly, and declares that things will start to change at the school immediately-- only, perpetual senior Victor, a gang leader and defacto boss of the school, will hear none of this, and declares war on Rick and his reform ideas.The Academy Award-winning but underrated Lou Gossett continues to slum it here, as Jake, the head of security.

More than a few times the lighting and the camera-work conspire to produce beautiful images that fill the entire greyscale range, and feature deep blacks; as when Joan Crawford is escorted into a dark room; or when the witness to a murder flees screen-right to a non-opening door. Occasionally the maudlin story breaks for startling camera-work as when; Wallace Beery stands in the smoky foreground as his associates bale on him; or more impressively, John Barrymores body exits the hotel via the service entrance as deliveries are being made; It's absolutely striking and foreshadows the objectives of realism by 2 or 3 decades. This is Hollywood? It's also way ahead of noir.Crawford is a joy to watch in every single scene. (and I'm not a Crawford fan) Garbo is ridiculous, giving a scenery-devouring performance that is always operating at the wrong scale. I wanted to throw a shoe at her head.
