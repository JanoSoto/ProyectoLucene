[{"date":"28 November 2004","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Peaceful alien race being systematically hunted and destroyed pick up TV signals of old Star Trek-esque show. They model themselves after the show then seek out the (aged) characters on Earth for leadership to avoid their final extermination. Tim Allen is on target, if obviously so, in Capt. Kirk role and is well-supported by Rickman as a reluctant Spock-type and a pre-Monk Shalhoub as unflappable engineering officer Chen. Weaver has never looked better as female crewman and Rockwell might as well be David Arquette in amusing role of forgotten crewman. I'm often uncomfortable during Tim Allen movies, they seem to have an odd combination of schtick, schmaltz and the bizarre, and this one travels part way down that road. But the take-off on the Star Trek culture, including their obsessed fans, is so accurate that minor sins are forgiven.
