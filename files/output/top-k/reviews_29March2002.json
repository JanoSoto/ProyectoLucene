He's made some overrated and mediocre films (Clerks, Dogma) and a couple of films that are both bad and funny at the same time (Mallrats and Jay and Silent Bob). OK, Jay and Silent Bob was HILARIOUS. All (except Dogma) take place in the twisted universe of Kevin Smith's imagination, and if it weren't for all the funny actors that have spoken Smith's written word over the years, that imagination would be pretty forgettable. However, sandwiched inbetween those four forgettable films, Kevin Smith somehow made a brilliant and insightful romantic comedy.Every romantic comedy, of course, has a twist, this one being that the female is a lesbian. A tough obstacle to overcome, to be sure. But due partly to Smith actually using his Red Bank Universe to move the plot along for once, that obstacle is plowed through. Bad news for Ben Affleck In this film, you've reached the high point of your acting career. You're never going to deliver a performance like you do in this film, and no one's ever again going to hand you a script as good as this one. So cherish it, buddy! I believe Howard Hawks said for a movie to be good, it had to have three great scenes, and this one does. The first is Holden (Affleck) telling Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams) his true feelings. The second is their fight after the hockey game. And the third is the pivotal scene at the end where Holden proposes his twisted solution to Alyssa and Banky (Jason Lee). That's two great scenes that I give much credit to Affleck, and the only two I can think of in his career up to this point. Particularly his facial expressions of disbelief when Alyssa rejects his proposal. Even Silent Bob, that old softy, gets into the act with a really good story that is the meaning behind Chasing Amy.Smith's insightful writing into relationships is remarkable in this film. The first two of the aforementioned three scenes are so well written, they're almost painful to watch. What probably needed a little more work was how Holden and Alyssa fell for eachother, particularly Alyssa for Holden. Smith has a couple of lightweight scenes, then the invariable spending time together and falling in love montage that romantic comedies usually fall back on. One of the films only weaknesses.When Chasing Amy isn't being romantic and insightful, it's freaking hilarious. And that hilarity is usually provided by Jason Lee. That girl could be a bigger germ farm than that monkey in Outbreak is one of the funniest lines I've ever heard in a movie. The Hooper X character provides a lot of laughs too. I'm not sure how most of the gay community feels about all the lightweight gay bashing in this film, but I can't imagine anyone being offended, since we're laughing with, not at, the characters.I'm willing to bet that the pivotal scene near the end with Holden, Alyssa and Banky looked really bad in the script to anyone who read it for the first time. This is the scene that makes or breaks the film, in my opinion, and it easily could have broken it. I would imagine that there is almost no one out there, gay or straight, that could conceive of saying yes to the proposal that Holden makes. The proposal, and the entire situation, are so ridiculous that it's a wonder they pulled it off. A lot of the credit goes to Smith, for writing the buildup to that scene throughout the whole film. But, again, I give most of the credit for this scene, and therefore the film overall, to Ben Affleck. It doesn't matter that the words that are coming out of his mouth are ridiculous and absurd. What matters is that he believes them. It's obvious that he's put a lot of thought into what he's saying, and right or wrong, he sincerely thinks he's got it all figured out. As important as all that is his stunned reaction of sheer disbelief when Alyssa tells him no. He just simply cannot believe Alyssa wouldn't go for his brilliant plan! Fantastic acting by Affleck, most of it nonverbal, that makes the whole movie work.Another great thing about this film is the ending. Not the traditional happy ending, but the happy ending with hope. No, the film doesn't end with the couple living happily ever after, but simply gives the audience hope that maybe...This is an ending that suits a film like this, that is realistic in many senses, and one that people can actually relate to. High Fidelity, another really realistic look at relationships, has a similar ending, though a little more upbeat. A romcom like While You Were Sleeping can work with the traditional happy ending, because it's an absurd premise that no one is going to relate to anyway. Change the type of ending on any of these films, and they just won't work. But I digress.Kevin Smith has had a nice little run with his quintet of Red Bank films (quartet, if you don't count Dogma). He has said that he's done making films with these characters, which is good to hear. While we've seen nothing from Smith so far (including Chasing Amy) that shows he has great directing talent, he has shown he can be a hell of a writer, and hopefully we'll see more insightful work like this from him in the future.And dammit, I like Joey Lauren Adams' voice!!!

That girl could be a bigger germ farm than that monkey in Outbreak is one of the funniest lines I've ever heard in a movie. The Hooper X character provides a lot of laughs too. I'm not sure how most of the gay community feels about all the lightweight gay bashing in this film, but I can't imagine anyone being offended, since we're laughing with, not at, the characters.I'm willing to bet that the pivotal scene near the end with Holden, Alyssa and Banky looked really bad in the script to anyone who read it for the first time. This is the scene that makes or breaks the film, in my opinion, and it easily could have broken it. I would imagine that there is almost no one out there, gay or straight, that could conceive of saying yes to the proposal that Holden makes. The proposal, and the entire situation, are so ridiculous that it's a wonder they pulled it off. A lot of the credit goes to Smith, for writing the buildup to that scene throughout the whole film. But, again, I give most of the credit for this scene, and therefore the film overall, to Ben Affleck. It doesn't matter that the words that are coming out of his mouth are ridiculous and absurd. What matters is that he believes them. It's obvious that he's put a lot of thought into what he's saying, and right or wrong, he sincerely thinks he's got it all figured out. As important as all that is his stunned reaction of sheer disbelief when Alyssa tells him no. He just simply cannot believe Alyssa wouldn't go for his brilliant plan! Fantastic acting by Affleck, most of it nonverbal, that makes the whole movie work.Another great thing about this film is the ending. Not the traditional happy ending, but the happy ending with hope. No, the film doesn't end with the couple living happily ever after, but simply gives the audience hope that maybe...This is an ending that suits a film like this, that is realistic in many senses, and one that people can actually relate to. High Fidelity, another really realistic look at relationships, has a similar ending, though a little more upbeat. A romcom like While You Were Sleeping can work with the traditional happy ending, because it's an absurd premise that no one is going to relate to anyway. Change the type of ending on any of these films, and they just won't work. But I digress.Kevin Smith has had a nice little run with his quintet of Red Bank films (quartet, if you don't count Dogma). He has said that he's done making films with these characters, which is good to hear. While we've seen nothing from Smith so far (including Chasing Amy) that shows he has great directing talent, he has shown he can be a hell of a writer, and hopefully we'll see more insightful work like this from him in the future.And dammit, I like Joey Lauren Adams' voice!!!

I've enjoyed a lot of his work--especially Edward Scissorhands, which I feel is his best--and also have been bored silly by a bit of some of his other stuff (Mars Attacks!). I got a kick out of Ed Wood, enjoyed Beetlejuice and was delighted by Sleepy Hollow and The Nightmare Before Christmas since they both seemed to be a return to his more traditional style.This film is by no means a match for the original 1968 masterpiece, but that doesn't mean it's not interesting or fun to watch. In fact, it's more interesting than I expected it to be. Sure, it's just treading water, but what redeemed it in my eyes and earned more respect in me for the script's concept than I otherwise would have had is the ingenious and wildly misunderstood ending.I'm not a huge POA fan, but that doesn't mean I don't admire it. While the original films were simply too dark, cynical and terrifying for me as a child, I admired them very much for their great intentions--that is, to use a sci-fi story as a metaphor for prejudice, intolerance and class problems (basically reminding us all that treating others as less than ourselves lowers us to the level of wild animals instead of beings with the ability and intelligence to treat each other with love, dignity and respect).My main complaint here is Marky Mark. Lousy actor. He reminds me of Madonna skimping her way through such flicks as Body of Evidence and Shanghai Surprise. He simply can't communicate emotion. Charlton Heston was wonderful as Taylor, a man who begins his dark tale as a cynical jerk who gets a taste of his own I-can't-stand-people-and-think-they're-no-good medicine and comes to realize that his attitude was the same one that led to the nightmarish situation he now faces. In this new version, Leo Davidson is simply bland and almost gives the impression that he's gotten himself as stoned out of his mind as possible just to avoid dealing with his dilemma. This makes it hard for the audience to identify with him, but even so the story's idea is so strong with its ending being so effectively jarring (even when trapped in a cornball script) that it can be frightening in its own right.Which brings me to the twist ending. Before I explain it, I just want to mention something after reading all the comments both on here and made by paid critics, I am genuinely amazed as a writer how little people pay attention to the finer details of scripts! I guess the modern attention span of folks is so limited that such important details sprinkled throughout the story are lost unnoticed these days (a good example Roger Ebert's comment that all the apes' varieties don't make sense considering the film's logic--YES, THEY DO! Look carefully in the beginning of the film and you will SEE WHY!).Tim Burton and his writers created the ending *VERY CAREFULLY*, and it is NOT--I repeat, *N*O*T*--just tacked on! All you need to do is pay attention, use logic and imagination to realize the gaps, and you will see that it is NOT really just some cheap setup for a sequel. In fact, going by the film's logic there isn't really any NEED for one, as the film stands on its own in its entirety!As if in outraged retaliation to the public's criticizing the finale, the videotape and DVD versions of this film contain a featurette re-showing various scenes and saying, Watch carefully for clues that lead to the explanation of the surprise ending! It further goes on to say that, just in case you are still too dense to get it, more information is further available on the movie's official webpage.***WARNING MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD!***After seeing this film, I was easily able to guess what must have happened. I was delighted to find the info I've mentioned above on the internet later on and discover my theory to be correct!What basically happened in a nutshell was this Thade was bloodthirsty for revenge (remember, he was never killed in the movie) and learned all about space travel through the information contained in the Oberon, salvaged and repaired Leo's ship, then attempted to pursue him through space and time.

He led a rebellion of the apes and disrupted it into what we saw at the end of the movie before Leo's arrival.It would appear that Burton wanted a portion of his film to be the same way that such new films as The Blair Witch Project are... meaning, films that must also be experienced over the internet and through various other provided sources alongside the movie in order to completely understand them! In other words, asking the audience to use their intelligence instead of spoonfeeding all the information to them! Very ingenious. And different, too!That said, I for one am very impressed.

Shakespeare did it.  Dickens did it.  Stephen King has made a career out of it.  The problem with Along Came a Spider is that no-frills clichés are all you get, basic and unadorned. The movie's ad campaign should have featured bare white posters, a bar code and the word `Thriller' printed in the middle. Okay, I overstate.  You do get Morgan Freeman and Michael Wincott. Mr. Freeman has never given a bad performance and doesn't start with this film.  Mr. Wincott is also very, very good. He makes you feel a little sorry for his character despite his murderous escapades. You rather want to comfort him when the inevitable problems start cropping up.To make sure you are getting your moneys worth, the writers have thrown in a `Guaranteed Surprise Ending. Now some movies sport twist endings that are knockouts.  These endings not only come as genuine surprises and are completely satisfying; they force you to reconsider everything that went before in the film.  Think of The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects or The Crying Game. First, in all these movies the ending was prepared for.  No matter how unexpected ultimately the twists make sense in the terms of the logic of the movie.  Second, you recognize these movies as superior long before you reach the conclusion.  Had The Sixth Sense ended five minutes before it did you still would have remembered the performances, the genuinely scary moments and the fantastic plot.  The twist came as icing on an already fine cake. Along Came A Spider has a surprise ending because, well, 'Thrillers' have `Surprise Endings'.  That's all.  You probably won't guess it, but even so you won't be all that surprised.  You will realize that since because such and such happens, the movie can only end in two or three different ways. Like the rest of the movie the twist is mechanical and non-descript.  It's satisfying enough but it operates more as a punctuation mark than anything else.This sounds like a pretty negative review - and I guess it is.

You have a taste in your mouth for guns and psychopaths and you've already seen Hannibal, so what do you do?

The movie's ad campaign should have featured bare white posters, a bar code and the word `Thriller' printed in the middle. Okay, I overstate.  You do get Morgan Freeman and Michael Wincott. Mr. Freeman has never given a bad performance and doesn't start with this film.  Mr. Wincott is also very, very good. He makes you feel a little sorry for his character despite his murderous escapades. You rather want to comfort him when the inevitable problems start cropping up.To make sure you are getting your moneys worth, the writers have thrown in a `Guaranteed Surprise Ending. Now some movies sport twist endings that are knockouts.  These endings not only come as genuine surprises and are completely satisfying; they force you to reconsider everything that went before in the film.  Think of The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects or The Crying Game. First, in all these movies the ending was prepared for.  No matter how unexpected ultimately the twists make sense in the terms of the logic of the movie.  Second, you recognize these movies as superior long before you reach the conclusion.  Had The Sixth Sense ended five minutes before it did you still would have remembered the performances, the genuinely scary moments and the fantastic plot.  The twist came as icing on an already fine cake. Along Came A Spider has a surprise ending because, well, 'Thrillers' have `Surprise Endings'.  That's all.  You probably won't guess it, but even so you won't be all that surprised.  You will realize that since because such and such happens, the movie can only end in two or three different ways. Like the rest of the movie the twist is mechanical and non-descript.  It's satisfying enough but it operates more as a punctuation mark than anything else.This sounds like a pretty negative review - and I guess it is.  In fairness I should say I enjoyed myself watching it.  A predictable experience is not necessarily a bad experience.  Sometimes all you want is a no frills `Thriller'.  You have a taste in your mouth for guns and psychopaths and you've already seen Hannibal, so what do you do?  Sure, a movie that sautés it's clichés with a bit more sauce and spice would be preferable, but if your only other option is a Matlock rerun, Along Came A Spider looks pretty darn good!

The questions it raises are unoriginal, the answers are suitably reassuring, the characters are flat, but for all that it gets under your skin with a kind of mournfulness that permeates every scene.You would think this is science fiction, but it's not. Because you know what? You can't extract people's memories from their brains with syringes. We have a pretty good idea how memory works, and we know for certain it's not available in liquid form. Science fiction extrapolates based on our current knowledge; this film is surrealist fantasy with SF trappings, a bit like City of Lost Children or the unfortunate Kafka.The city itself here is a marvel, precisely because there is nothing futuristic or imaginary about it. It is composed of buildings and objects from the memories of its inhabitants. Everything in it is a mix of different decades - just look at the cars in the overhead shots. The way the production design achieves a unique look is through its layout of the cityscape, lighting, details and points of view.A point about the strangers; they resemble most closely Peter Lorre's character in Mad Love. Bald heads, slouch hats and long overcoats. The only thing missing is black goggles and the chrome-plated hands and neck brace from that movie.As in any good movie of this kind, the villains\/monsters are touched with pathos; they are not simply evil, but a dying race making a last effort to survive. Yes, it's been done to death, but it still is a sight better than the unmotivated bad guy who simply exists as a foil for the main characters, evil for no reason other than that the script requires it. In this day and age, we take what we can get.The ending is bittersweet. The characters can never recover what has been taken away from them, but must start over with what memories they have. Jennifer Connelly is beautiful, as is William Hurt's accordeon. The final showdown is Hollywood SciFi standard, with beams of energy lashing about in a desperate failure of imagination (come on, these character can alter reality, they can do better than this!) On the other hand, William Hurt's exit is sad and poignant, particularly when it comes so unexpectedly. Finally, this movie has soul where the Matrix does not. Period.

You know, the proud to be me speech.I'm not a doctor, so I don't pretend to know everything there is to know about transsexualism (who does?), but I do know this a great number of them aren't born like that, they're turned into that (traumatized). I personally know 3 transsexuals (male turned female), and all three told me their parents had intended for a girl, and treated them like one (dressed them up like girls, called them girls nicknames, the whole works. One was even raped by his own brother). Anyone who doubts this can happen, just remember that more than one person walks straight into jail, and leaves gay because they were raped inside (I'm not saying that every or most gays were raped or misraised and therefore traumatized into becoming one, much several were and are).And another thing. Recently I read in  an interview with a convicted necrophiler (guy who rapes corpses) and child molester. He defended himself saying that society didn't have any right to punish him for accepting who he was and therefore indulging his desires and needs. He wasn't hurting anyone regarding raping corpses (worked at the morgue, so he didn't trespass any grave), so people should let him be. He even said that if a man is entitled to have sex with another man, why not say, brother and sister (they can adopt), or father and daughter (same), or man an pet (never mind), or man and a corpse?

She isn't just going through the motions in this movie but instead giving a believable, solid performance.The three villains play their roles well. Whitaker, of course, shines the brightest. But Yokam is strong as the true protaganist. Alongside as the third villain, Jared Leto continues to impress me as a strong actor in a gutty performance.It's an enjoyable movie for adults and one that all movie types can enjoy.

Others have delved into the story but I won't bother as this sort of stuff was done better nearly 100 years ago in Perils Of Pauline (will the heroine get rescued by the villain from the locomotive\/bandsaw\/raft-over-the-waterfall?). All Pauline lacked was expletives and gore, which this flick has in abundance.  It's just not done right, so the effect is unintentionally comical. The suspense comes in the form of just how many holes in the storyline can the viewer spot every minute or so. After the first ten minutes of gratuitous product shots of Coca Cola, Evian and Sony littered about The House I had already lost whatever sense of going to the movies is supposed to be about because they were not even GOOD placements (Quick ECU of hand opening bedside fridge (!) reaching for bottle of Evian) and they drain any opening scenes of momentum. This was followed by some of the most unconvincing thugs that ever wandered onto a set. Jared Leto played a loud, foul-mouthed intruder in the manner of a wanna-be actor on his first audition ...I kept expecting an off-camera voice to  yell Thanks. We'll call you. It's as if  Rick Fox of the L.A. Lakers (whom Leto slightly resembles) was to suddenly land a supporting role and imagined himself An Actor (come to think of it, Rick Fox might have been a better choice).  The bumbling trio is rounded-out by a psycho-killer (Raoul) portrayed by Dwight Yoakam and a con-with-a-conscience played by Forest Whitaker. Yoakam and Leto (in a real bad display of miscasting) are about as sinister as a pair of Don Martin cartoon crooks who couldn't crack an egg, let alone a safe inside of a panic room, while Whitaker does OK with his role by reading his lines without screwing them up. If he could have improvised the script, he would have (spoiler ahead) taken his partner Yoakam apart after the latter had a major malfunction to a certain part of his anatomy and was subsequently rendered harmless by an incident with a sliding steel door. These three very unwise men almost succeed in breaking into the panic room, but quit trying for some reason known only to them. An implausable episode with an air duct heightens the awareness in the viewer that this panic room is about as easy to break into as a can of sardines. There are security cams galore throughout the house, but does anybody think to do anything about them? The Whitaker character has a heart of gold and could have stopped the movie with a happy ending 2\/3's of the way through, but then...oh why bother? Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart are the victims, along with you, the viewer.  And The L.A. Times is already running puff pieces in its Calendar section about Panic Rooms and why they are catching-on with the rich and paranoid under the guise of news and how David Fincher-this and Jodie Foster-that... so go on and be a chump and plunk down your $8.50 and wish you didn't. Like Edward Van Sloan said in the intro to Frankenstein  Well, we warned you! Or save yourself the trouble and go rent Kubrick's The Killing and see the ending that Fincher pays homage to in his own tepid little way.  4 out of 10 for some neat camera work that will soon be turning-up in every TV spot that can afford it while it's still cutting-edge.
