It's no wonder the producers let them direct aforementioned sci-fi\/action masterpiece after they did this. For such a little amount of money, they really made the most of it. Few characters, sets and occasionally limited camera-work is easy to look past(hard to notice, in fact). The movie is breathtaking. For the entirety of the last half I was literally at the edge of my seat, extremely excited and couldn't wait to find out what happened next. The first half is mostly a setup for the last half, but it isn't boring, and is well worth watching, as it makes the second half near-perfect in suspense. The lesbian subplot might throw some people off, and will definitely offend some people, but if you're aren't one of them, then you most likely will enjoy it, if you're into thrillers. The plot is very well-written, and with twists and turns thrown in every so often, it keeps you watching closely. The acting is mostly good, especially from the three leads. The characters are great... diverse, interesting and credible. The cinematography contains several of the same things later made famous in The Matrix... anyone who's seen both movies can tell that it's the same people behind the cameras. The action is really well-done. The story-telling is just slightly experimental... reminiscent of various heist flicks. This also contains some quite stylish visuals, though not as many as the brothers' later works. All in all, just works really well and keeps you entertained throughout. I recommend this to any fan of the Wachowski brothers, thrillers and\/or the actors in it. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"5 February 2004","score":"26 out of 38 people found the following review useful","review":" I watched this because I'm a big fan of the Wachowskies, and after watching their first movie(Assassins, which they only wrote) I hoped to see another masterpiece from the makers of The Matrix that had nothing to do with it.

He cannot form new memories. He can remember everything clearly before the accident, but nothing afterwards. He must figure out a way to live his life with this condition and to catch the person or persons responsible. Can he do it, and if he does, how will he remember it?First off, I would like to say that Memento is probably my favorite movie of all time as of yet, and not without reason. It's probably the movie with the most reply value that I can even imagine. Every time I watch it, I notice something new or come up with a new theory on things. The acting is as good as it gets and all the characters were cast perfectly. Guy Pearce is one of my favorite actors simply because of this movie and L.A. Confidential alone. Joe P. plays the perfect good cop\/bad cop and Carrie Ann Moss is very convincing as the revenge riddled, manipulative woman.Everything about Memento is flawless. The script, acting, dialog, camera work, editing, direction, story&#133;.everything. This is as good as it gets folks&#133;..to such a degree that I seriously almost feel sorry for the people who don't get this movie or understand it, as they're missing something so spectacular. Some people have even gone as far to say that the movie contains plot holes. I beg to differ and must presume that these such persons aren't too quick. There's a method to the madness. Of course the movie has holes in it which open up almost endless possibilities, but that is a reflection of the fact that Leonard did not have all the details either. His file for instance. We are left with fragments of memories just like Leonard, and are forced to actually think and try to figure it out with him. Some people don't like to think I guess, or are completely incapable. Maybe it would have been better for them if Lawrence Fishburne rambled on about all of the details for about 45 minutes with sunglasses on, all while pooching his lips out. The fact that we don't know all of the details and that the story's origin and ending do have infinite possibilities is one of the reasons that I love this film so much and is why it's so great. Brilliant, simply brilliant. Had it been done accidentally or out of tactlessness then I would think the exact opposite, but that is certainly not the case here.Sometimes a `gimmick', like filming a movie to be watched out of chronological order, can be pretentious and unnecessary, as we see in movies like 21 Grams. However, Memento's story was meant to be told this way. It's another technique that adds to the audience's lack of knowledge about what has happened in the past, exactly like Leonard's. These techniques all contribute to getting the audience to care about Leonard, and it works. Although the film is viewed backwards, all of the scenes slightly overlap each other so it's easy to follow. The director has used two different types of scenes here as well. We have the color, reverse sequence scenes that show what Leonard has been through&#133;.and we have seemingly chronological black and white scenes in which we are given tidbits of information about Leonard and his condition as he talks to an anonymous person on the telephone. Truly masterful work. This movie will leave you thinking about it for a very long time.

I've seen and own dozens of WWII movies and this is one of the best. The story unfolds in a grand sweeping fashion reminiscent of Lawrence of Arabia, even Lost Horizon. At the same time it manages to capture a reality of life and loss that rarely sees the light of day on film or anywhere else for that matter.It's great to see so many people here at IMDb and elsewhere have so much good to say about this film.

No doubt, there are plenty of people out there who automatically equate 'foreign language' with 'art' (and dually equate 'Hollywood' with 'trash'), who managed to convince themselves that this film is making some sort of sociological or philosophical point, or something. Perhaps even the filmmakers believed that they were making a 'real movie,' although judging from their backgrounds, I have my doubts. In fact, the filmmakers were smart in the sense that, being devoid of any actual talent, they decided to gain their film publicity in the easiest possible way - after all, it doesn't take much effort or creativity to have sex on camera. And this sort of material generates controversy without even trying, and as they say, no publicity is bad publicity. The problem is not the level of sex or violence on display here. It's not even the dire storyline - which plays like Thelma and Louise minus all positive qualities, but with a hefty serving of reverse misogyny thrown in to compensate. It's simply the sheer ineptitude on display during the entirety of its running time (though admittedly its only saving grace - and I use the term lightly - is its reasonably short duration). The script was a non-starter to begin with, and is not redeemed by either the performances or the production values. Of particular note are some embarrassingly awful special effects (the rule of thumb as far as I'm concerned if you don't have the money to do it properly, don't); and some unintentionally hilarious 'cool' scenes with the girls wielding a gun in each hand, in slow-motion, John Woo style.If you want to see some controversial foreign films that are also good - there are plenty of options available, such as Battle Royale or Irréversible.

Some critics felt it was an atrocity-an assault on good taste, movie-making craft, and humanity in general. Others felt that it was a masterpiece, a cinematic statement that went where no movie had gone before. I believe, personally, that the film is a must-see. Not because I think it is one of the best movies ever made (there are flaws, like an over-abundance of themes that muddy the film's message), not because I think it's one of director Oliver Stone's best (Platoon and JFK are both superior films), but because I think that it represents a unique cinematic experience. You will never see any film that affects you in the same way that Natural Born Killers does. In that way it shares the same place in filmdom with such diverse titles as Eraserhead, Being John Malkovich, and Plan 9 from Outer Space there's just nothing out there like it. Its attitude towards its lurid, frightening, and oftentimes repulsive subject matter alone distinguishes it from many other movies. It has fun with death and violence in a way that makes you contemplate on the nature of what is being shown to you on screen. The fact that it simultaneously decries and glorifies violence would seem hypocritical if the movie seemed to be unaware of the conflict of interest inherent in it. However, Stone is all to cognizant of the problem, and is indicting himself as well as the glory-chasing media with the final product. The fact that the two serial killers are watching Scarface, a movie Stone wrote, is as important for its commentary on the filmmaker as its film buff in-jokeness. Another aspect of this movie that received a lot of attention was its singular editing style. Characterized by multiple cuts, lighting patterns, filming techniques, and even some animated interludes, the movie acts as a technical geek show. It is a full-frontal assault on your eyes and ears. And I, for one, think Stone's jack-hammer style fits his subject perfectly. A wild, disorienting plot deserves a wild, disorienting storytelling style. You will also be hard-pressed to find realistic characters in this movie. Stone has filled NBK with a gallery of grotesque monsters, from Tommy Lee Jones' screeching redneck-from-hell prison warden, to Robert Downey Jr.'s parasitic Robin Leach-like talk show host, to Tom Sizemore's virulent psychopathic bad cop. All these characters add to the vision of the film, because an insane film with an insane filming style deserves insane characters. But, when it comes down to it, Natural Born Killers is an important modern film not just because of its style, tone, and characters, but because it causes discussion about America's modern obsession with serial killers and the media's infatuation with violence. Pop culture itself is on trial with this movie, and Oliver Stone delivers it a visceral knockout punch. Great soundtrack, too.

A truly great book, Enemy at the Gates, The Battle for Stalingrad tells the full story of the German 6th army's successful invasion deep into Russia until they were stopped at Stalingrad.  While the movie concentrated on 2 central figures (the 2 snipers), the book goes much more into detail on how the Germans failed to support their flanks in the large areas outside of Stalingrad, poorly protected by their Hungarian allies.  The fierce fighting to take control of the city lasted many weeks, from August 1942 thru January 1943 but it was the successful counterattacks outside the city that surrounded the 6th army and spelled its doom that was the real story of this battle.  This was the most important battle of World War 2 that totally changed the momentum of the war and if you watched this movie you missed all these important facts.  What happened to the 6th army after they were surrounded by the Russians and were ordered to hold fast and not retreat from Stalingrad while their army was still strong enough to break out and make a run for it would have made for a much more enjoyable and educational film.

The fierce fighting to take control of the city lasted many weeks, from August 1942 thru January 1943 but it was the successful counterattacks outside the city that surrounded the 6th army and spelled its doom that was the real story of this battle.  This was the most important battle of World War 2 that totally changed the momentum of the war and if you watched this movie you missed all these important facts.  What happened to the 6th army after they were surrounded by the Russians and were ordered to hold fast and not retreat from Stalingrad while their army was still strong enough to break out and make a run for it would have made for a much more enjoyable and educational film.  If you do not know the full story of Stalingrad, you can watch this film and not have a clue how the Russians end up winning this key battle (although you do learn which sniper wins the dual).  If you are going to make a movie with the exact same title as the book (Enemy at the Gates), it would help if you followed the book a lot closer than this movie does. 2 stars out of 4 in my opinion.  I was horribly disappointed in the film for those reasons.  If it had followed the book, it could have been so much better.

Wando, the volcano as a character, even the townsfolk), giving convincing backstory as to how volcanos behave compared to scientists' expectations, making us care about the characters, building tension through conflict between Dreyfus and Dalton, and using effects to ramp up the intensity of the action scenes.Yes, there were things in the script and the story which seemed a little contrived and strained believability. The attitudes and behavior of the USGS team were a little too informal and hip to seem real. The driving-through-the-river and driving-through-the-lava scenes were really too far out to be believed. Ruth's selfishness and patent stubbornness were unbelievable but understandable. The scene where the pyroclastic cloud chases them into the mine is pure hollywood fluff but still livable, mainly because WE CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. I found the character of Dr. Paul Dreyfuss to be right on. He explained the dilemma well during the city council meeting scene. All of the characters are believable at least, convincing at most.I think the chemistry between Dalton and Wando is believable  Here you have a scientist who is analytical and professional, but who is still in touch with the lives of laypeople, and has a tender side. He has loved and lost before and he senses that this new volcanic threat is akin to the last one which took his love away. This re-enforces the precept that THIS TIME, HE WON'T LET THE VOLCANO HURT THE ONES HE LOVES. Wando is the warm, slightly ditsy mayor of Dante's Peak who displays the identifiable traits and values of a northwesterner. She feels slightly overwhelmed by her mayoral duties, raising her kids properly, and running her coffeeshop. She's had a previous marriage to a deadbeat who left her at a vulnerable point. The arrival of Dalton is very catalytic in her life. She's met the only man who has the right answer about the volcano, likes her kids, likes her, is intriguing, and is everything her ex wasn't. THIS IS THE MAKINGS OF A ROMANCE...DUH.I'm really impressed that the filmmakers were able to pack this much character development, backstory, romance, suspense, personal conflict, with an intense end-sequence in under 1 1\/2 hours!

This is the first movie of it's kind, where a character can the the F word so many times and still have so much dignity. He is not only incrediblly funny, but he is also a powerful figue in the film, changing his attitude from one extreme to another, whilst remaining hilarious. Bringing washed up actors back from the dead has also been a trait of QT's (Pam Grier - Jackie Brown, David Carradine - Kill Bill). John Travolta went from a B-grade actor to one of the most recognisable and entertaining actors in the world. His dance scene with Uma Thurman is so funny, you wont stop laughing for hours. Uma Thurman also plays her role spectacularly. Also not quite as strong as in Kill Bill, her character is more deep and required more attention than the Bride in Kill Bill. The big man himself, Tarantino, also makes an appearance as Jimmy from Taluca Lakes. Many people criticise his role as Jimmy, but I personally found his performance to be hilarious. The way his character worked with the Wolf (played by Harvey Kietel) was exceptional. After watching this amazing movie, you will want to watch it every chance you get. You will never get enough of the hilarity of Samuel L. Jackson's character, or the genius film-making techniques of Tarantino. If you have not seen this film, go and rent it, actually dont do that!!!
