The first was that I'd be there for quite awhile (it's nearly 3 hours long). The second thing I was expecting to see, were two great actors show why they are among the best in Hollywood today (Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins).  I firmly believe that Brad Pitt is the best actor in films today (he often gets too little credit for his acting abilities due to his sex appeal and that's unfortunate).  As far as the length of the film is concerned.yea, it is long for a non-epic type of film, but I was amazed by how quickly the 178 minutes seem to go by.One of the best things about MJB is the way the film develops it's characters.  Director Martin Brest does something in MJB that too few films do today.he makes you actually care about what happens to the characters you see on the screen.  Some people may find many of the early setup scenes to be boring and useless.  I, on the other hand, feel that those scenes are the one's that really bring us into Joe Black (Pitt) and William Parrish's (Hopkins) world.  To end without mentioning Claire Forlani would be a crime. She does a wonderful job as Susan Parrish (Hopkins daughter) and I look forward to seeing her in more films in the very near future.MJB is an outstanding film that is filled with some amazing dialogue.  In addition to that it is a great romantic film, a surprisingly funny film at times, and most importantly it is the most touching film that I have seen since Titanic (I fully admit that I may feel this way due to the fact that I have a daughter to call my own.  Having a daughter enables me to relate to the father-daughter scenes, which are incredibly done by Hopkins, Forlani, and Martin Brest).

No such luck, I'm afraid.  It's almost entirely impossible to tell when the action focuses on the character who's supposed to be the main character and when it focuses on someone else.#2 The Concept The Concept is War turns you into a monster.  Okay, first of all, this is a tired and stupid concept, it's been done eloquently and grippingly in two of the REAL war movie classics Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now. Secondly, see point #1.  The main character, barely ever named, impossible to tell apart from anyone else, is supposed to change.  Well, maybe he does, but I never had a clear idea of what he was like in the first place to change... so basically this movie takes a tired concept and executes it badly.#3 The Action This is a movie about war.  Right?  So you kind of expect there to be at least some good action.  Well, this is very disappointing, too.  The central scene of the movie is about a whole bunch of American troops trying to secure a hillside protected by a hidden Japanese bunker.  There's a lot of shooting, and there are some people dying but the scene skips around all over the hill, you can never tell which group you're with or where they are or what they're supposed to be doing, so basically it's just confusing.#4 Gore Well, without some action, it'll at least have some gore, right?  SOME kind of effects?  Wrong.  At one point, someone is hurt by a hand grenade, and instead of showing anything, they basically just show his face with a little blood on it as he slowly dies.  Basically, the best effects you can hope for are people pretending to get shot and falling over.#5 Dialogue Why not at least have some decent lines?  I have to admit, the dialogue the characters actually engage in isn't too bad, but there's this constant, confusing, rambling, pointless talking, some detached narrator goes on and on with.  None of it makes sense; artistic talk like that kind of requires that you understand the character, or that you at LEAST know who's talking.My basic complaint is, after sitting in this movie for 2 and a half hours, I still didn't know who anyone was, what was going on, what the point was, and I had stopped giving the movie a chance.

But, I DO NOT blame him, for the creative genius is at work in this film. The main reason the failure of the movie is the story. A clear indication was given that Michael Crichton was probably pressured into writing a sequel novel just for the sake of another movie. The story seems very rushed, sort of a last minute job. It was going to be hard to top 1993's original hit, so you can't really expect it to be better.

The hateful rhetoric becomes almost plausible as you listen to Derek's (Edward Norton) views at the dinner table, or his recruitment campaign to the other young neo-Nazis.  The writer\/director cohorts do an impressive job of accentuating the vicious circle of racism, and the actor portraying the main character, Edward Norton, carries out a brilliant performance worth remembering.I found the symbolic effects used throughout the movie were very effective, some being more subtle than others.  The most obvious was the use of black and white film for the flashbacks, when Derek (Norton) was a neo-Nazi, and the contradicting use of colour when he was released from prison, reformed. The suggestion that everything was black and white for him when he had his racist, bigot and white-power beliefs; everything was so clear and sensible to him; he was right, they were wrong, was ambitious and significant.  White was good; black, or any other tone for that matter, was bad.  The switch to colour during scenes when he was reformed was a hint at the refreshing nature of what life can be when you look at it from a different angle, when you take down your wall of hatred.Another little symbolic reference was the bowl of jellybeans.  Seth picked out the one black one before chugging down the whole bowl of white ones. Although at first glance it may seem like a joke, as if you think he's picking out one jellybean to eat it, but as a reference to his excessively overweight condition, swallows the majority of the candy, if you think for a second it's fairly easy to spot the white\/black ratio, and his reaction to it.One other quick symbolic gesture was Derek's move at the coffee shop near the end of the movie.  He held open a door for a woman who was not white. Quite subtle, but effective.  There were quite a few other events or items with a similar purpose that I noticed at the time I was watching the movie, but which I unfortunately cannot remember at this moment.To end this ferociously long spiel on American History X, I just wanted to respond to a comment that another IMDB member who reviewed this movie saidSo neo-Nazism isn't the answer, but what is?  The movie leaves you dangling on this point, not really resolving anything.But that's the exact point. Nothing is resolved in this world.  People look for answers in the wrong places, and most of the time never find them. Leaving the movie unresolved, yet establishing a blockade against neo-Nazism is not, in my opinion, unrealistic or unfurnished quality.  Nay, in fact, it's the opposite.  It IS realistic, because whether you search for answers in religion or gangs or hate, etc. etc. etc., you aren't going to find it. The answer to life is within yourself.

There were quite a few other events or items with a similar purpose that I noticed at the time I was watching the movie, but which I unfortunately cannot remember at this moment.To end this ferociously long spiel on American History X, I just wanted to respond to a comment that another IMDB member who reviewed this movie saidSo neo-Nazism isn't the answer, but what is?  The movie leaves you dangling on this point, not really resolving anything.But that's the exact point. Nothing is resolved in this world.  People look for answers in the wrong places, and most of the time never find them. Leaving the movie unresolved, yet establishing a blockade against neo-Nazism is not, in my opinion, unrealistic or unfurnished quality.  Nay, in fact, it's the opposite.  It IS realistic, because whether you search for answers in religion or gangs or hate, etc. etc. etc., you aren't going to find it. The answer to life is within yourself.  And the answers are endless.  I feel that's what this movie was trying to explain.

With the year 2000 breathing down our necks, I think it's safe for me to give this movie the Best Comedy Of The 90's award. On a final note, this movie kinda makes you feel all good inside as well.  Think about it  two dumb morons who are plagued by bad luck all throughout their life just say screw this and drive across the country to Aspen to give a beautiful girl back her briefcase while encountering many perils along the way.  Once in Aspen, the perils and the fortunes just keep piling up.  The movie does have a sad ending in a way but hey, they're making a sequel so there's no need to pity Lloyd and Harry too much.

Of course. Midnight Cowboy is perfect film to fit that description. It is no ordinary film, instead it is a unforgettable journey through the eyes of two drifters who slowly witness their lives plummeting deeper into a decadent world of drugs, sex and hopelessness. It is such a rarity for a film to provoke such intense emotions and thoughts like this film does, it leaves a sharp impact. Midnight Cowboy explores the bleaker side of life, and how cruel the world can be to people just trying to achieve their dreams. Jon Voight gives a remarkable performances as one of drifters, Joe Buck, a naive Texan native who dreams of becoming a hustler. Dustin Hoffman is equally as brilliant portraying the sleazy but dying con man, Ratso Rizzo. Midnight Cowboy is not a film that shies away from the brutal reality, instead, it displays the corrupt urban jungle at its grimmest, as it robs the two lead characters of money, dignity and ultimately hope. But amidst the depressing tale lies a unusual but profound coming-of-age story between Joe and Ratso. Midnight Cowboy shows the signifigance of a shared bond, especially through such painful cirumstances. You can call it the American Dream gone sadly wrong, Joe and Ratso`s journey comes to a tragic halt at the end of the film. Midnight Cowboy`s final scene is the most heart-breaking moment I`ve ever seen in a film. It will surely leave an impact on you forever.

His background is in bodybuilding, not theater, movies, or even TV commercials.  Furthermore, his name is hard to spell (I spelled Arnold correctly, didn't I?).  But he is a movie star, perhaps the biggest in the world, which isn't too surprising since he makes BIG movies.  Terminator 2 and Total Recall had budgets and box-office grosses that made Arnold himself look puny, and 1994's True Lies, though no match for Forrest Gump at the ticket windows, is in the same mold.  It has another thing in common with Schwarzenegger's other films  it's boring.Oh sure, it's packed reel to reel and frame to frame with incredible stunts and state of the art special effects, but where in its 2 hour and 22 minute running time is the humanity or even a coherent storyline?  Action is all True Lies has to offer, which may be enough to satisfy most viewers, but to watch Arnold battle and prove victorious against the baddies, there should be a context, a way of becoming involved in his plight.  Not surprisingly, the filmmakers didn't have time for that. Presenting the characters as something other than cardboard cutouts would take time--time better spent on what the producers hoped would lure audiences to the theaters in the first place  action.Directed by James Cameron, True Lies is a bit more interesting than most of Arnold's films because it is an homage of sorts to James Bond movies.  It opens with a scene strongly reminiscent of 007's entrance in Goldfinger. Schwarzenegger emerges from a lake (river? pond?) in black scuba diving gear.  He unzips and is now impeccably dressed in a tuxedo.  After a hot dance with Tia Carrere at the social event he's crashed, Arnold detonates a bomb, and, now, in a scene that echoes On Her Majesty's Secret Service, our hero flees on foot while pursued by assassins on skis.  Arnold's adventures take him underwater (Thunderball), in the air (A View to a Kill), and, as in dozens of Bond films, into the lair of his enemies. True Lies might just as well be titled James Bond's Greatest Hits, but it's missing one crucial ingredient  James Bond himself.In 1963, when the first Bond film was released in the U.K., heroes were fairly down to earth guys dealing with fairly down to earth problems.  Dr. No ushered in a different kind of hero; one who faced danger with a wry smile, an arched eyebrow, and a quip or two.  The Bond films had virtually no suspense--who ever doubted that 007 would not emerge victorious and embark on another adventure?--but they worked because they weren't really action adventures so much as they were parodies.  They mocked movie star heroics.  The fun was in seeing just how Bond would escape from the often wildly imaginative traps the enemy set for him and the ultracool manner in which Bond confronted what would, for a more realistic character, be certain death.  Still, as played by Sean Connery, Bond could perspire.  When Roger Moore took over the role, the series was reduced to a live-action cartoon.True Lies is also a cartoon, one that rehashes and tips its hat to, and in a sense pokes fun at,  James Bond.  But since Bond was always something of a joke himself, what does that make Arnold and the other folks behind True Lies?  The ones who never understood the punchline?
