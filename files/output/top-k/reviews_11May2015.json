Everything about this movie shines, beginning with the story itself. I really liked the story, in which the title character is a dead woman whose presence still lingers in many ways. The plot takes quite an unexpected turn near the end of the movie, when a shocking revelation is made. Hitchcock is known for twists and turns that the story and its characters take. There is always at least one big secret hidden away in the story. Secrets that us as viewers seemingly believe our characters have no way out of, but somehow someway the story comes back around and changes our minds. Hitchcock, like several other great directors is always good at creating memorable characters, and this one has plenty. Particularly the housekeeper Mrs. Danvers. She holds the craziest grudge over Rebecca as she enters her newly married life into the mansion. Although I personally found Rebecca's character to be of weak nature, it somehow brings out the cruelty in Mrs. Danvers, giving her an even larger ability to hate the girl. Overall this is an impressive and engaging film that tells a good story with a great approach, producing a dark and interesting film that is driven by an unseen character whether the tone is melodrama, romance or mystery story.

It is a timeless classic which was made with heart. Spielberg created this movie with commitment and passion, he wanted a dream come true, a dream of so many kids who are in love with dinosaurs. In that era profit was not the major priority unlike nowadays.Jurassic Park's visuals are still amazing, even after 22 years it could stand its ground. Back in those days CGI was revolutionary but the high use of practical effect is the main reason of greatness. Sound effects are also outstanding, everyone can recognize T-Rex's roar which can be awesome and scary at the same time.Spielberg added horror elements as well, this made some movie scenes even more intense and terrifying. Without doubt the T-Rex scene is the perfect example for this. He perfectly built up the tension and let the thrill culminate, with this technique he created one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history.Besides being a great movie it is able to come up with meaningful thoughts about re-creation. Characters were put into situations where they have a chance to mull over and argue about the resurrection of dinosaurs. This is a perfect environment for topics like scientists who want to play God again, what the nature sentenced to extinction should not be bothered, Is it possible for mankind to live with nature peacefully? etc. There are plenty of characters to represent each side and they have enough time to engage in an interesting discussion.Sam Niel was an excellent choice for the role of Alan Grant. Laura Dern was also great and Richard Attenborough played the dreamer well who can't accept failure. The presentation of Hammond and Malcolm sometimes looked like a Yin-Yang to me (the color of their clothes were the evidence for that). Without doubt the highlight was Jeff Goldblum. Some of his quotes still appear in my everyday life. Kids were also lovely which is a big statement if we try to compare them with today's child actors.John Williams does not need an introduction, he is a mastermind. Music completely harmonized with scenes and the main theme gives me goosebumps every time.

I want a new brain for Arnie. I want&#x85;Looking back at Leonardo DiCaprio's filmography I'm constantly reminded what a great actor he is. In What's Eating Gilbert Grape, he plays a seventeen year old mentally ill kid in such a natural way that if I didn't know this was Leo I would've believed the actor playing Arnie was really mentally ill. This is probably one of his standout performances and is one of the highlights of this emotionally gripping family drama. However he is just a supporting character in this film as the title character is played by Johnny Depp, Arnie's older brother who is always taking care of him and the rest of the family. Gilbert's father has abandoned them and ever since he has been the male role model for the family in the small community where they live. He not only takes care of Arnie, he also has to provide for the family by working in a small local supermarket. He is ashamed of his obese mother (Darlene Cates), who simply stopped caring about her beautiful body after her husband abandoned her. Gilbert also has two sisters who help out with the family chores, Amy (Laura Harrington) and Ellen (Mary Kate Schellhardt). The responsibility Gilbert feels towards his family has taken its toll on him and explains why he seems to be half asleep all the time. He has no time for accomplishing any personal goals or dreams and spends his few free minutes with his local friends, Tucker (John C. Reilly) and Bobby (Crispin Glover). Things take an unexpected turn when Becky (Juliette Lewis) arrives in town and the two form a special bond together. What's Eating Gilbert Grape is an emotionally gripping family drama that works thanks to the strong performances from the cast and a fantastically well written script by Peter Hedges. The film avoids feeling cliché or melodramatic and I found it to be an honest story. Lasse Hallstrom has been accused of being overly melodramatic at times, but I think that the director avoided much of those moments here thanks in most part to a well written script.Leonardo DiCaprio gives the best performance of the film, but Johnny Depp also delivers in a very subtle way. His character doesn't seem to say much, but the way he simply moves and speaks says a lot about him. He knows he isn't getting anywhere in life and feels stuck in this small town, but at the same time he has responsibilities and knows that his family relies on him to survive. He is trapped in a prison he can't get out of. He cares deeply for his family, but at the same time he resents them and it seems they have become a burden for him. The way he approaches the character is fascinating because he doesn't have to say or do anything for us to understand how he feels. We can easily identify and sympathize for his character. The chemistry he shares with Lewis is also strong. She is in some ways the opposite of him. She is free spirited and has travelled across several states. She doesn't have many responsibilities, and the two end up complementing each other quite well. Their relationship might not be the central theme of the movie, but it does lighten up the mood a bit. Reilly is always funny on screen and despite playing a more serious character he still delivers his usual quirky silliness to the role. All these small relationships are the central theme of the movie and the brotherhood between Depp and DiCaprio stands out above them all. I enjoyed this family drama and I'm glad I finally got a chance to watch it. http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"11 May 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I want Momma to take aerobics classes.

Lasse Hallstrom has been accused of being overly melodramatic at times, but I think that the director avoided much of those moments here thanks in most part to a well written script.Leonardo DiCaprio gives the best performance of the film, but Johnny Depp also delivers in a very subtle way. His character doesn't seem to say much, but the way he simply moves and speaks says a lot about him. He knows he isn't getting anywhere in life and feels stuck in this small town, but at the same time he has responsibilities and knows that his family relies on him to survive. He is trapped in a prison he can't get out of. He cares deeply for his family, but at the same time he resents them and it seems they have become a burden for him. The way he approaches the character is fascinating because he doesn't have to say or do anything for us to understand how he feels. We can easily identify and sympathize for his character. The chemistry he shares with Lewis is also strong. She is in some ways the opposite of him. She is free spirited and has travelled across several states. She doesn't have many responsibilities, and the two end up complementing each other quite well. Their relationship might not be the central theme of the movie, but it does lighten up the mood a bit. Reilly is always funny on screen and despite playing a more serious character he still delivers his usual quirky silliness to the role. All these small relationships are the central theme of the movie and the brotherhood between Depp and DiCaprio stands out above them all. I enjoyed this family drama and I'm glad I finally got a chance to watch it. http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"11 May 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I want Momma to take aerobics classes. I want Ellen to grow up. I want a new brain for Arnie. I want&#x85;Looking back at Leonardo DiCaprio's filmography I'm constantly reminded what a great actor he is. In What's Eating Gilbert Grape, he plays a seventeen year old mentally ill kid in such a natural way that if I didn't know this was Leo I would've believed the actor playing Arnie was really mentally ill. This is probably one of his standout performances and is one of the highlights of this emotionally gripping family drama. However he is just a supporting character in this film as the title character is played by Johnny Depp, Arnie's older brother who is always taking care of him and the rest of the family. Gilbert's father has abandoned them and ever since he has been the male role model for the family in the small community where they live. He not only takes care of Arnie, he also has to provide for the family by working in a small local supermarket. He is ashamed of his obese mother (Darlene Cates), who simply stopped caring about her beautiful body after her husband abandoned her. Gilbert also has two sisters who help out with the family chores, Amy (Laura Harrington) and Ellen (Mary Kate Schellhardt). The responsibility Gilbert feels towards his family has taken its toll on him and explains why he seems to be half asleep all the time. He has no time for accomplishing any personal goals or dreams and spends his few free minutes with his local friends, Tucker (John C. Reilly) and Bobby (Crispin Glover). Things take an unexpected turn when Becky (Juliette Lewis) arrives in town and the two form a special bond together.

Instead of spending two and a half hours watching George Clooney and Matt Damon rob casinos or Kevin Spacey and Julianne Moore dealing with their problems in New Foundland, I found myself pulled into another kind of story, a powerful, emotional story of how one man learned to battle his own demons and dazzle the world.A Beautiful Mind, based on the novel by Sylvia Nasar, is the story of John Forbes Nash Jr., the genius mathematician, whose life suddenly takes a turn for the worse when he is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After fierce battles with his inner self, he overcomes this and returns to win the Nobel Prize in 1994 for his brakethrough game theory in economics that he had been working on during his years in Princeton University in the 1950s.John Nash, portrayed very well by the versatile and brilliant Russell Crowe, is a partly shy, yet ironic and sometimes even arrogant, gifted young student studying in Princeton University in the late 1940s. He dedicates his time to numbers and equations, set on to solving every problem at hand, rather than mingling with co-students on the football field or in the pub.Nash is later on introduced to Sylvia (played by the lovely Jennifer Connely), a physics student attending his classes.

And it is a film about a writer, a far from empathetic character, starting the process of becoming a better person.This is really a film for persons who have had lots of quality time with, or been, someone like Melvin Udall - isolated, and socially, and emotionally unaware. Without that experience base, it's probably hard to care about.The rest of us will see mirrors in Melvin's words and the reactions of Carol, Simon, and others.

You are probably also familiar with the 'star' of Bio-Dome, Pauly Shore. Shore was an MTV VJ during this time and even had his own show such was his popularity, especially in the USA. He became globally known through his character Stoney Brown in the movie California Man (1992) and his career grew from strength to strength. Personally, I was not a fan of Pauly Shore, although I must be fair to him, he is only the 3rd worse Shore on MTV, (#2 Jersey, #1 Geordie).In 1996 he decided that a successful career was not for him and so set about destroying it by making Bio-Dome. Plotwise it involves 2 dropout stoner dudes who accidentally get trapped in a Bio-Dome which is subsequently sealed for 1 year as part of an experiment into sustaining a mini Ecosystem with 'hilarious' consequences. It's easy to compare this movie to Bill and Ted's Excellent adventures. Like Bill and Ted, they are similar ages, both Californian surfer types, dropouts and under achievers. There is, however, one slight difference. Bill and Ted, are characters you grow to care about, even like and you really want them to succeed by the end of the movie. Bud and Doyle, on the other hand, you want to punch in the face repeatedly (And I don't condone violence, but even the Dalai Lama would need anger management after watching these two). Bud (Shore) and Doyle (Stephen Baldwin) really fail to connect with the audience or unfortunately a large mallet.I'm very high brow and enjoy a good fart gag as much as the next professor. But when it's constantly forced down your throat, (metaphorically), over and over again for 90 minutes it really starts to grate. But it did not need to be like that. The opening few minutes has good slapstick, physical comedy and decent gags mixed with toilet humour. The problem is that this formula is then rinsed and repeated, with nothing new to offer for the entire movie.There are a lot of famous names in this film. Kylie Minogue, for example, but neither her nor her bottom could save this movie. She is quoted as saying Bio-Dome is the only film which she regrets. Someone may have to remind her she was also in Street Fighter (1994). There is also a cameo from Jack Black and Kyle Glass who appear as their band Tenacious D, (overall the soundtrack is very good and includes Reverend Horton Heat, Faith No More and The Ramones). Penn and Teller also make a background appearance at the very end, (although they look like they have wandered onto set by accident and desperately want to find their way out again!).I must, however, make a confession. I actually quite liked it. The truth is I did laugh in places, it was so stupid that I did not have to think for 90 minutes and because of that I could wind down, relax and almost, (gulp) enjoy it.So I will conclude with this, Bio-Dome is not a good film in fact it's mind-numbing rubbish. However, one Sunday morning, post 10 pints, several shots and a very large greasy kebab, one of the movie channels will be showing a film dedicated to the memory of the career of Pauly Shore. It'll be Bio-Dome and you will not change the channel, you will secretly enjoy it and forget how crap you feel this morning, (and that embarrassing incident with the traffic cone and that squirrel).Bio-Dome has many flaws but it's one redeeming feature? It's a bloody good hangover film.

The release poster for this movie is soo beautiful and intriguing! This movie is filled with a winning cast all around! Anthony Hopkins was great as usual, and so was Winona Ryder, who gave a very convincing performance as Mina. I know it was heavily criticized, but I rather liked Keanu Reeves in this film, I thought he made his character very likable and also very convincing! The Costume Design is one of the greatest costume designs in any film period. The time period dresses, armor, suits and robes fit soo well in this movie! The sets were so amazing to look at, especially when it came to Dracula's castle! Well deserved Oscars! I adored Dracula's brides here, the way they behaved, presented themselves, the manner in which they spoke, all of these aspects were cranked up in their portrayal of these three evil wives of Dracula, especially in the scene where all 3 seduce Jonathan Harker. I'm glad that scene was in the film, it really shows and reveals the true nature of Dracula's wives, and I just love the way they handled themselves, with fangs, a smile, the elaborate costumes, and with a very very sensual manner, which is an integral point of his wives. There were a few awkward moments as far as acting, but overall, very good! I also really embraced the beginning story of how Dracula became himself by losing his beloved. And the ending was actually and surprisingly very touching, and I'm glad it was, nice to see Dracula have some real emotions and feel love like a human. Francis ford Coppola is an amazing filmmaker, and hopefully, his daughter will continue the good work. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 May 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) is a visually stunning film, that's what got me interested in watching it.

No man's life can be encompassed in one telling, the opening credits state, what can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record and try to find one's way to the heart of the man. Yet Gandhi manages to achieve more than most biography's by not only portraying the famous historical events that the man lived through, of which no doubt helped form his own ideals, but by showing us the real man behind the speeches and the fasting, who enjoyed spending time at peace with his loving wife or operating his spinning wheel.Wisely avoiding Mahatma Gandhi's early life, we are first properly introduced to the man as he rides a first-class carriage in South Africa. He is thrown off for being a non-white, even though he possesses a first-class ticket and is a practising lawyer, and this event provokes him to form a non-violent civil rights movement. Through sheer will and stubbornness, the government eventually relents and passes laws benefiting the residing Indians, allowing Gandhi to return to India in the process. When he arrives in his native country as a hero, he witnesses the same prejudicial brutality at the hands of the occupying British Empire. Through more non-violent protests, Gandhi manages to unite millions against the British, causing a divide between the Hindus and Muslims in the process.Gandhi was a labour of love for Attenborough, who fought for over a decade to get to the film made. Alec Guinness was rumoured to be set for the role of Gandhi when the movie was still in the hands of David Lean, and after seeing Ben Kingsley's portrayal of the great man, such an idea now seems utterly preposterous. Kinglsey's performance is without a doubt one of the finest embodiments of a public figure in history, not only settling for a good impression and an uncanny resemblance, but convincing to the point that you believe Gandhi himself is on screen. It's a quiet, dignified performance, often channelling Gandhi's gentle charisma, shrewd wit and fierce intelligence without saying anything at all.For all it's technical impressiveness - the film is undeniably beautiful, shot with a grandiose David Lean-esque epic feel with extra's numbered in the thousands - it occasionally plods. Although the events in South Africa no doubt shaped Gandhi's attitudes and spirit, we spend far too much time there, and this doesn't allow the complex events in India to unravel with the time and care that they warrant. The aftermath of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the growing political and social unease between the Hindus and Muslims, and the events that led to Gandhi's assassination are all rushed over the finish line. Without these flaws, Gandhi may have been a masterpiece. However it is still an enlightening experience, and the praise lavished upon Kingsley (as well as his Oscar) is wholly justified.
