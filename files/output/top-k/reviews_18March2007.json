It tells the story of a modern Texas rancher, Hud Bannon (Paul Newman) who is amoral and his life with his family as they face tough times when their cattle herd is diagnosed with hoof and mouth disease. Hud sees the diseased cattles' demise as the chance to move his father (Best Supporting Actor Melvyn Douglas), Homer, out as head of the family ranch. He argues that buying diseased Mexican cattle is evidence that his father is no longer capable of running the ranch.Trying to oust his father from his job is not Hud's only wrong. He carouses with married women, he advises his father to sell their sick stock before the government has a chance to examine them and he ually assaults the family's maid Alma (Best Actress Patricia Neal) but is stopped by his admiring nephew Lon (Brandon de Wilde). Hud is utterly amoral and is an early anti-hero, such as Newman later made popular with his character Luke in Cool Hand Luke.The best scenes in this movie occur between Hud and his father Homer as the two engage in the combat that had persisted for many years. Hud thinks his father dislikes him because of his role in the death of his older brother. But Homer tells Hud he disliked him well before his son's death. He tells Hud that his problem is he does not care about other people and how he affects them. And, his father worries that Hud is a bad influence on his grandson Lon, who seems to admire Hud and his ne'er-do-well ways.This is a very well-acted movie, with 2 Academy Award winning performances and Newman a nominee for Best Actor.

If ever the term timeless could be applied to a film, it must surely be this one. The truly remarkable thing is that nearly seventy years have gone by since this film was first shown, yet the central theme - somebody's life being one long miserable struggle because of a physical defect &#150; is still totally relevant. How many kids face daily humiliation because of the size of their ears, the colour of their hair, a blemish on their skin, a problem with their eyes, the appearance of their teeth, or their weight? Dumbo is a story to bring hope and warmth to every person who has ever felt self-conscious, and to heap shame upon any person who has ever victimised another because of how they look.One night, the animals of a travelling circus show are brought babies by the storks. But for an elephant called Mrs Jumbo it is a sad night. As she watches all her friends get their new babies, she slowly realises that the storks do not seem to have a tiny elephant for her, even though she was expecting one. The next day brings a wonderful surprise though. A stork arrives &#150; better late than never! &#150; with a baby elephant for the despondent Mrs Jumbo. She is overjoyed and proudly announces that his name will be Jumbo Jr. Then, the little baby sneezes and from the side of his head unfurl the most impossibly big ears that anyone has ever seen. Pretty soon, Jumbo Jr. is the joke of the circus, laughed at and ridiculed by all, and cruelly nicknamed Dumbo by the other female elephants. One day, some mischievous children visit the circus and tease Dumbo; when Mrs Jumbo reacts violently towards them, she is taken away and locked in a cage away from her baby and the rest of the circus. A determined circus mouse called Timothy befriends Dumbo, and promises to make him a star. After many misfiring attempts to fulfil his vow, Timothy finally hits upon the inspirational idea of using Dumbo's massive ears &#150; perfect wings, as he calls them - to achieve flight. Overnight, Dumbo goes from being the butt of everyone's jokes to the world's first flying elephant, a celebrated star of the circus and the most remarkable animal on earth!It's hard to know where to start when recommending this film. The animation is marvellous for the time, and the voice acting is simply superb. Edward Brophy as Timothy and Sterling Holloway as the stork are particular stand-outs. The film has some catchy songs, the best of which are the now-classic Elephants On Parade and When I See An Elephant Fly, the latter brilliantly performed by a bunch of comical crows. But the most significant factor of all is the simplicity of the story &#150; it is so relevant and inspiring and well-told that it is unlikely this film will ever lose its appeal. A film has been created here that will remain popular and effective for as long as films are around &#150; I won't be here to find out, but I'll wager that 200 years from now Dumbo will still be cherished by children of all ages all over the world.

As for Sam Raimi, the Evil Dead saga hasn't got a prominent place in my favorite horror movies but a Simple Plan (1998) and the adventures of Peter Parker\/Spider-Man gave me a positive side from him.I could have the same judgment about Rodriguez himself I saw the Faculty (1999) when it was theatrically released and I forgot all about it. Ditto for Sin City (2005) which was visually a black splendor but I don't remember much about the story. On the positive side, From Dusk Till Dawn entertained me until the last shot. It's cut in two distinct parts. The first one has more the look of a road-movie imbued with thriller with stunts, shootings, corpses galore and a dash of suspense. It's the part I favor the most. The second half of the film changes territory and takes a leap into the gore movie sourced from the eighties with blood, special effects to satisfy the genre. There is also a little of George A.

But perhaps, it was an inescapable rule to this kind of story.The amount is a film rooted in two different cinematographic genres and if it's a little hard to swallow, it means to jump on a genre while jettisoning the other, Rodriguez's effort has positive things in its contents to have a good time. Sequences are shot with care and shrewdness like the very first one. Like in Reservoir Dogs, we won't properly see the bloody break-in but just verbal facts from the characters and the TV. It is also permitted to hail Tarantino for his sharp dialogs. My favorite lines are when George Clooney and Tarantino take Harvey Keitel and his son hostage and Juliette Lewis arrives in the room from the swimming pool- What's, um, going on? - We're having a bikini contest and you just won.Later in the van on the road that leads to Mexico- Where are you taking us? - Mexico - What's in Mexico? - Mexicans.Black humor shouldn't be neglected like the sequence when the journalist says the increasing number of killed people after the hold-up. And the actors seem to have fun as much as we do, notably Clooney and Tarantino in psychopathic killers who shoot first and ask themselves questions then.This B movie won't cater for all tastes for evident reasons but as it is painstakingly made as a whole, the alliance Rodriguez\/Tarantino paid off well and it's a film to which I would return with pleasure.

And the actors seem to have fun as much as we do, notably Clooney and Tarantino in psychopathic killers who shoot first and ask themselves questions then.This B movie won't cater for all tastes for evident reasons but as it is painstakingly made as a whole, the alliance Rodriguez\/Tarantino paid off well and it's a film to which I would return with pleasure.

I came across The Rage Carrie 2 on the shelf, looking for something to take me back to the late '90s nostalgia I've been feeling lately. Hey, anything is better than this decade we're living in, right? I popped The Rage Carrie 2 in, and watched it for the second time ever. I've had this movie almost 2 years, and I've only watched it twice. I guess second chances are good, because this time around, I don't know what it was, this movie touched me. Maybe it's because I have a girlfriend whom I really love, I dunno. Anyway, the performances were excellent. Emily Bergl really did a great job of playing Rachel; she really made me sympathetic and empathize with Rachel. The part where Rachel begs and pleads with God to take her life because she has been so humiliated and is finally at the end of her rope emotionally, really broke my heart. Any movie that can bring me to tears earns points in my book. Jason London takes on a different role from the one he had in Dazed and Confused, although he still manages to be on the football team. I was really hoping for him to save Rachel in the end, but of course we all were, I'm sure. The other cast members of this film, including Amy Irving (why did she have to die so horribly!!??, I guess keeping up with the tradition of the one sympathetic adult getting killed in a gruesome and violent way, kind of like Miss Collins in Carrie). I really hated the other jocks, so therefore the performers who were portraying them did their jobs well, as did the other popular people. Eddie Kaye Thomas was kind of off in left field, but I guess so was his character. The shatter effect really got me to jump. So, a shout out to Katt Shea for directing this film.

In some ways, it's a pretty good film but in so many others it is only adequate at best. First let's discuss the good. Pairing Robert Mitchum with Marilyn Monroe actually worked pretty well. Mitchum's laid-back style and Monroe as a sexy but more human sort of character than she normally played made the casting decision pretty good. Monroe was quite beautiful but her makeup was definitely more under-stated. She also sang pretty well, though she did seem to sing an awful lot. Also the main story idea was very good and culminated in a wonderful showdown--with a terrific ending. The problem, though, is that the film sunk to the level of mediocrity due to it being pretty sloppy--with some ridiculous dialog sounding, at times--more like it belonged in a Film Noir flick, grainy rear-projection during the rafting scenes, a silly knife fight where both Mitchum's son and Monroe just stand there doing NOTHING as he's almost killed and many, many contrived situations to see Ms. Monroe take off her clothes. Most men in the audience didn't mind this, but after a while it made me laugh because it looked as if the writers deliberately inserted many such scenes! First, she is a barroom singer and she must naturally sing in her underwear, then when she's on the raft she gets so cold and wet that Mitchum tells her to take off her clothes when they take a break (though he and his young son were fine and kept theirs on) and when they were attacked by Indians, one grabbed Monroe's blouse and naturally it just tore away!!! I actually thought this was pretty funny.Finally I'd like to point out that the print on videotape is really, really bad. At times, it's very, very yellowed.

The idea of vengeance against those that do us wrong is a driving force in cinema. But most of the time we get a horribly predictable movie that follows a set formula. And then there is The Crow. In its own, stylized way, The Crow puts to rest all those other vigilante movies, and creates a new form, one that leaves the viewer pleased, and never disappoints.Since the first time I saw this movie, which was about the time The Crow City of Angels was released into the theaters, I was fascinated by the look of this Gothic tale of unrequited love and the scorn of a soul burdened by the torment of great loss. I had only seen the movie once, on HBO, but fell in love with the story. I never really got around to renting it, but if I saw it on the program schedule, I would set time aside to watch it.Now that I am older, and I own the first three (The Crow, The Crow City of Angels, The Crow Salvation) I have been able to view it and truly grasp the masterpiece in its entire form. From the soundtrack, to the pop culture references, and even the references in pop culture. It shows the true greatness of comics that become great movies (Sin City and Hellboy being two others.) The story and the acting are terrific and the all out vengeful nature of Eric Dravin is what captures my attention the most.Let's not forget the plethora of colorful characters with the jolly pirate nicknames. From Tin-Tin to T-Bird, Skank to Funboy, and (my personal favorite) Top Dollar. The charismatic villains and the even more charismatic hero (anti-hero to be exact) truly shine in this masterpiece.However, this movie is also very tragic.

From the soundtrack, to the pop culture references, and even the references in pop culture. It shows the true greatness of comics that become great movies (Sin City and Hellboy being two others.) The story and the acting are terrific and the all out vengeful nature of Eric Dravin is what captures my attention the most.Let's not forget the plethora of colorful characters with the jolly pirate nicknames. From Tin-Tin to T-Bird, Skank to Funboy, and (my personal favorite) Top Dollar. The charismatic villains and the even more charismatic hero (anti-hero to be exact) truly shine in this masterpiece.However, this movie is also very tragic. It would be the last movie Brandon Lee would ever make. He was killed in an accident while filming. Like his character, he was to be wed to his fiancé in just three weeks after filming was to be wrapped up. He follows the mysterious death of his father, the martial arts legend Bruce Lee.All tragedies aside, one of the greatest movies ever made. Followed by an all right sequel and then two more, less than mediocre sequels after that, the original stands true. The best Crow movie out there. The original, the best, The Crow.

That seems rather ignorant to me, as this is the second prequel installment, so of course more familiar elements will be demonstrated here than were in the first, as there will be even more in Episode III. That is a given. For them to proclaim that this is somehow superior to the Introduction that was Episode I because of those more familiar elements, is just asinine. Episode I, as an introduction, was perfectly presented. This work, however, was more focused on Luca$'s obsession with teen love and an homagic tribute to his America Graffiti, than any attempt at the actual meat of the Star Wars Saga.While there was lots of action and some brilliant effects, this chapter of the Star Wars saga ran more like your typical teenage angst-filled romance, than what I would expect from the Luca$ Star Wars money machine.Episode II is a literal sea of cameos by other well-known to fairly-known actors.

You may remember him from Lord of the Rings trilogy as Celeborn !! .As most of you now know, the star is Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker. Now, I've nothing against the lad, but Hayden Christensen?! The Star Wars money machine is a far cry from playing the Paper Boy in John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness, and it shows. He plays the part unprofessionally. I was not impressed with this young man's talents in the least. His portrayal is stiff, as though he's been taped to a long pole which has been run up his back. He delivers his dialog as though he were reading cue cards while merely parroting the words.Anakin is full of the usual teenage angst; rebellion, outbursts of pious whining, given to fits of sulky anger and more whining. But his execution of this performance never quite rings the bell. He appears angry, but doesn't quite demonstrate it. He appears full of pain, but is not quite convincing. The story helps to convince, but Christensen falls short each and every time. Scene by scene, his actions are designed to demonstrate his leaning towards the dark side, but he's too normal a teen aged boy for this tool to be the least bit effective. He does not demonstrate the appropriate darkness necessary for him to pull it off the role of a would-be Vader. His unimpressive performance makes it completely unbelievable that he will ever BE Darth Vader. He's too...average. Some critics have declared that his murder of the entire village of sand people who captured and subsequently killed his mother, to be a sure indication that he is headed down the wrong path, but I daresay that were that any of OUR mothers, we might have behaved in much the same way without ever being classified at the level of evil one expects from he who will be Darth Vader. I guess this is just another one of thosewait and see judgments I will have to make after the release of Episode III.Don't get me wrong; you get a great movie. This work is filled with exhilarating battles, good story development (as long as you don't think about it), great visual effects, and otherwise stellar performances. It's just replete with plot holes, Christensen stinking up the screen, and devotes more time to Padmé and Anakin than it does the saga, itself.Featured within are several great battles, including a rousing battle between Yoda and Dooku. It was rather endearing watching Yoda jump around in that battle like a little spider monkey on crack. It looked impossible that he didn't cut himself clean in half. I kept expecting to see his two, separate pieces fall individually; green blood spraying the Count.The story which takes a back seat, but is evident, surrounds the Clone Wars. A long-deceased Jedi Master has ordered an enormous clone army to be constructed on behalf of the Republic. The cloners have secured the DNA of the very capable bounty hunter Jango Fett and have used his DNA to build the army. You later get to see Yoda take command of this army, though in a small way, to rescue the captured Jedi Knights and Masters from the clutches of evil.There is also a large sweeping epic story line which is somehow lost in what becomes nothing more than a trumped-up teen love story. For some reason, Luca$ seems unable to stay on the main plot, and keeps going back to Padmé and Anakin. We all know they both violated their vows and positions. We all know they are Luke and Leia's biological parents. We didn't need for half the screen time to go to their angst-filled teenage love story. This single factor, excluding all the questions and plot holes and\/or continuity problems, weighed this movie down so far from The Phantom Menace, that I can scarcely work up any enthusiasm for Episode III. What enthusiasm I do have is surrounding the possibility of Luca$ actually filling in some of these gaping holes, seeing Wookies in battle, and uplifting the prequel trilogy back up to the level where we, as Star Wars fans, need it to be.I suppose something like a 7\/10 is fair, but that will change after we see how well it introduces and sets up the story contained in Episode III, just as Episode III's rating will be determined with how well it was allowed to tie into Episode IV, so hopes are not high.the Fiend .

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"18 March 2007","score":"","review":" When all's said and done - and many have said it - it was the pacing that made most of the episodes of the original series so watchable. Of course, they had great ideas written into the plots, but it was those moments of tension and action during each act which made them so exciting. For this, the first film follow-up to the sixties original series and the animated show of 1973, the filmmakers focused on an idea - and pacing be damned. I first viewed this film when it played in theaters in '79; I was in my late teens. Afterwards, I told the first person who asked me - how was it, that I nearly fell asleep in my seat. I was young; I'd seen all the episodes in reruns and had been dazzled by their energy. This film was like the anti-Trek to me at this point, a complete reversal of the things which made the original show so great. We are asked to worship the Enterprise when she first appears, waiting to be launched, but the sequence ends up alienating us - forcing us to wait as the story pulls to a dead stop - a major miscalculation to be repeated a few times. It was a somber, even depressing mood throughout the film's storyline, with most of the main characters (especially Kirk & Spock) quite grim, as if they'd just escaped a Romulan prison after 10 years of captivity (wait, Romulans do not take captives). Yes, there was a major threat to be faced, but there was not so much anxiety as just plain dark moods, for some reason.But, there were no Romulans in the film; there were Klingons, however, briefly new brutish versions who encounter some vast mysterious entity out in space as the film begins. It's this initial sequence which immediately sets the tone and, unfortunately, the slow pace for the rest of the film. The lovingly-detailed warships move slowly towards their fate, as the camera pans over, under and all around. This really tests the patience of most in the audience and it's magnified later when the Enterprise slowly - oh, so slowly - drifts over the surface of the gargantuan vessel which we will soon come to know as V'Ger. The story takes place only two and a half years after the end of the 5-year mission of the original and animated series. Kirk is now an admiral in Starfleet Operations. Spock seeks to purge himself of all emotion on his homeworld of Vulcan. McCoy has grown a beard and gone into private practice. The rest (Scott, Uhura, Chekov, Sulu, now Dr.Chapel and even Rand) are working on the tail-end of the Enterprise's 2-year refit. The interior of the ship had changed quite a bit. So had the uniforms - an abrupt shift to an almost monochrome palette; it looked like everyone was caught in their leisure suits. All this is, by necessity, covered very briefly; after all, we need the time for that wormhole problem they encounter soon, when everything goes into slow motion. The scripted dialogue seems unrefined, uninspired the grand reunions we wait for are anti-climactic, with Kirk constrained to comments of how he needs McCoy, then Spock. No, really? The new characters are Decker (son of The Doomsday Machine Decker), the young new captain of the ship who must stand down for Kirk in the one hint of melodrama, and the Deltan female who has taken a vow of celibacy. Hubba-hubba. So off they go, to save the Earth, which we finally see for the first time here in the 23rd century, specifically San Francisco (no real change in the skyline after 300 years? come now!). It's at about this point, watching the film a 2nd and 3rd time, that I realized this was a film made for 2nd and 3rd viewings. All the hubris attached to viewing it the 1st time is now almost gone. I could kind of let go of my nostalgic inclinations of worshiping a legendary sixties series and try to savor the elegance striven for by director Wise and the screenwriters. Our beloved characters have been transposed to a thoughtful awe-inspiring quest, seeking answers to hazy, almost mystical questions. They're surrounded by $40 million dollars of budget (in seventies dollars!), a grand expense which will probably never be matched in the Trek film series. On my 2nd viewing, I had the luxury of settling back and studying these characters, as they steadily but surely get closer to some metaphysical answers. Was this copying 2001A Space Odyssey? Perhaps, to some extent, but if one had to pick a science fiction film to copy...Overall, they had trouble getting into a certain groove again, perhaps reflected by the characters' years of separation, but I could even relax now as Scotty takes Kirk on that lengthy exterior tour of the starship - it can be cool, sure. Now, if I was coarse and flippant, I might point out that Kirk and his crew probably should have guessed half of those answers sooner, based on their experiences from an earlier adventure, titled The Changeling. But, I won't do that. No, let's just leave it where it is, a grand if flawed experiment in magnificent Trekking, which may just gain more appreciation in time. At the conclusion, the Enterprise appeared to embark on its next 5-year mission, but we never saw it, except in comic books. No, we next see the Enterprise crew about a dozen years later(!) in The Wrath of Khan. That was when Kirk really began to regret...but that's a story for another time.

Jean-Luc, answers his superior, Admiral Dougherty, We're only moving six-hundred people. How many people does it take, Admiral, before it becomes wrong, asks Picard in return, A thousand. Fifty Thousand. A million? The above exchange occurs during Insurrection's key scene. The entire first half of the film meticulously builds to this conversation between Starfleet officers. Dougherty (Anthony Derbe) justified his actions because the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Picard (Patrick Stewart) sights the Prime Directive, which prohibits interference with other cultures or their natural development. The two officers had remained on a collision course until the moment when something had to give.The conflict begins during a routine survey. Insurrection opens with a gorgeous panorama of an agrarian village. Children frolic about in the tall grass outside the perimeter. Farmers lift gates to aqueducts, women laugh pleasantly as they slam down their bread dough for kneading and the blacksmith works away. We are treated to long panoramic looks at the restful town and its benign inhabitants, the Ba'ku. Members of a culture survey walk about unnoticed in their isolation suits, invisible to the eye. Director Jonathan Frakes' willingness to take so much time introducing the audience to the setting demonstrates an unusual amount of focus for a movie like this.The peace is shattered when Data (Brent Spiner) begins acting wildly. He exposes the survey and follows with many more bizarre and aggressive actions. The architects of survey, Admiral Dougherty and the So'na leader Ad'har Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham) orbit above the planet. Data's behavior puzzles and scares them, and they ask Picard how to destroy him.Delaying his orders, Picard (Patrick Stewart) arrives and successfully captures Data. Against the wishes of Dougherty, Picard stays to determine why his android became a loose cannon. Picard acquaints himself with Anij (Donna Murphy), a Ba'ku woman who informs him that Data told the Ba'ku that the survey team was their enemy. A short investigation uncovers a conspiracy to forcibly remove the Ba'ku from their planet.The planet, buried deep in a gaseous cloud called the Briar Patch, has rings that act as a fountain of youth to its inhabitants. Dougherty and Ru'afo believe that the planet must be used for medical reasons, and Picard is forced to make the choice to abandon the Ba'ku or violate his orders.It is at this point when the film accelerates. The conflict becomes a proverbial chess match between grand masters as the Enterprise crew tries to keep the planet inhabited. Both sides devise as many solutions as they can think of to accomplish their missions. The audience is almost invited to participate as the movie keeps them wondering what the next move will be.The script shines with an abnormal level of polish. It deftly handles the question of whether an officer should obey orders or stand up for what is right. Almost every line flawlessly captures the writers' intent and communicates them to the viewers with beautiful yet easily understood diction. Every character sounds expressive and well educated. The dialogue is free-flowing and enjoyable. There is even a scene where Picard calms Data with a rousing rendition of A British Tar. I imagine the production staff had a good laugh when they thought of that one.The acting is of the highest Trek standards. Abraham, one of the true gentlemen in Hollywood, is exceptionally good as Ru'afo. He is so superior that he has every subtlety mastered. The way his face sneers when he says Eliminate them, his vocal inflections, his different postures, his mannerisms, the passion and disdain in his voice all point to the work of a true master. Hatred seems to perspire from his every pore. A blood vessel bursts in his face and we can almost see hate flowing out of it. His friend Gellatin (Gregg Henry) is constantly talking him out of more extreme decisions. For Ru'afo, it is personal, but we do not find out why until the final act. He tops it all off with the best scream of anguish and frustration ever captured on film. Ru'afo may not quite be the most effective Star Trek villain, but Abraham's acting is the best in the series. He is not the most prolific actor, but he is arguably one of the best ever.Sadly, some of the story devices fall flat. In First Contact, the Enterprise was the most advanced starship ever made. Its quantum torpedoes were so powerful that it seemed nigh invincible. Here, however, it is too weak. There is one exchange where it is fighting with two So'na ships and seems badly overmatched. The Enterprise-E was designed to take on small fleets and win. If the Federation could defeat the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion, why can't the crown jewel of its fleet defeat two So'na cruisers? It is even controlled at one point by simple joystick. I never knew flying a 700-meter starcraft was so simple. Redemption does come with the ingenious denouement of the fight. There are also other moments that do not work, and some jokes fall flat.In the end, Insurrection shoots itself in the foot. It also suffers from following First Contact and the Borg.

For some reason, extremely liberal minded people tend to highlight the plight of killers in an attempt to raise sympathy. This theme is automatically off-putting and you need one hell of a script to pull it off.The blatant death penalty opposition was tedious. The continual referral to state sanctioned murder and the lethal injection causing a bodily Armageddon really got my eyes rolling and it was abundantly clear that they wished to use this film as an anti-death-penalty platform. Only thing is - this film failed to convince me and I live in a country where we don't even have the death penalty. Even Penn strapped at the end with tears in his eyes really didn't move me all that much. He was a murderer and his crimes were unforgivable. The fact that a good-hearted person might be at the core of every murderer doesn't inspire me to express outrage at the laws which proscribe the death penalty for murder. While the film doesn't completely ignore the fact that there were innocent victims, it approached that aspect the story way too self-consciously. It ensured that he really was convicted of a cold-blooded murder, but seemingly did so to ensure that no one would criticise the film for misrepresenting murderers on death row. Yet, the substance of the crime itself was largely used as a precept to the appellate court proceedings through which Robbins, in turn, could spout compassionate, yet legally baseless drivel against the death penalty. Another issue I had was the self-importance. Indeed, the film was ridiculously overlong and I was checking my watch frequently during the last 40 minutes. The plot was simplistic, yet somehow, Robbins hoped that the emotional and poignant texture of the film would carry it. But when a movie that tries to do this has me looking at my watch, I'm not totally convinced they pulled it off.I give it a low rating, but it earns a star for the recreating the steely prison atmosphere without overstating it. Or perhaps the critical praise of the performances in this film have already hogged up too much on the 'overstating' side of things?

Only thing is - this film failed to convince me and I live in a country where we don't even have the death penalty. Even Penn strapped at the end with tears in his eyes really didn't move me all that much. He was a murderer and his crimes were unforgivable. The fact that a good-hearted person might be at the core of every murderer doesn't inspire me to express outrage at the laws which proscribe the death penalty for murder. While the film doesn't completely ignore the fact that there were innocent victims, it approached that aspect the story way too self-consciously. It ensured that he really was convicted of a cold-blooded murder, but seemingly did so to ensure that no one would criticise the film for misrepresenting murderers on death row. Yet, the substance of the crime itself was largely used as a precept to the appellate court proceedings through which Robbins, in turn, could spout compassionate, yet legally baseless drivel against the death penalty. Another issue I had was the self-importance. Indeed, the film was ridiculously overlong and I was checking my watch frequently during the last 40 minutes. The plot was simplistic, yet somehow, Robbins hoped that the emotional and poignant texture of the film would carry it. But when a movie that tries to do this has me looking at my watch, I'm not totally convinced they pulled it off.I give it a low rating, but it earns a star for the recreating the steely prison atmosphere without overstating it. Or perhaps the critical praise of the performances in this film have already hogged up too much on the 'overstating' side of things?

For some reason, extremely liberal minded people tend to highlight the plight of killers in an attempt to raise sympathy.

It's a nice comedy about a little boy's wish for Christmas and is set back in the 40s. It's narrated by the boy who is now much older and is fondly looking back at the period, which included a lot of funny moments for he and his friends and family.Jean Shepherd narrates and Peter Billingsley plays the little kid, Ralphie Parker. He's fun to look at, with his nerd-like looks. It's also a good-natured film and, except for a few swear words, is safe for the whole family.Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon also shine as Ralphie's parents. I haven't seen this in a long time, but I always remember the little kid's favorite Christmas present, a red air rifle and his friend getting his tongue frozen stuck to a pole. That last scene has been a classic since this film came out almost 25 years ago.

No, it is most certainly not a great or perfect film, and definitely not the best of the decade, as some have claimed. It is, however, a fascinating show of what would happen on Earth if Alien Contact were ever achieved. Everyone would freak.This is the story of a young scientist named Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) who has lived her entire life believing that there must be something else out there sharing the universe with us. Otherwise, it seems like an awful waste of space. After fighting a losing battle for years to keep her program alive, she finally discovers an alien message by complete chance. After further study, they then discover that it is the blue-prints for a machine to be used to send someone to (presumably) meet them. With that news spread to the world, so begins the chaos of human reaction as the world must decide how to act on this data.The story is brilliant, one of the best things about the movie. We have all wondered at one time or another in our lives if there were other beings trying to contact us from outer space. Could there be intelligent life-forms out there? If so, what do they want- are they hostile or benign? This is the question that is posed for America in this film, and the country reacts exactly as I imagine it would in real life Skepticism, over-reaction, and fanaticism all inter-mingling with each other. The portrayal of how the human race reacts is so true, that it feels frighteningly real.The cast works very well at their individual roles. Jodie Foster shows her real acting chops once again as the dreamer-of-a-scientist who really is searching for just one thing Meaning in her life. The supporting cast does just what they're supposed to support. Matthew McConaughy plays the role of the man who is stuck between two worlds just fine, and James Woods, Tom Skerritt, David Morse, and Angela Bassett all turn in nice work. The real stand-out of the supporters is William Fichtner as Ellie's blind mentor. He does very well.It's a fine movie, one of the better science-fiction dramas for sure. However, it's not amazing, nor is it ground-breaking. It's just fun and interesting to watch every time. After all, that is what movies are supposed to be. 7\/10 stars!
