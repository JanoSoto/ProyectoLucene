[{"date":"14 March 2010","score":"","review":" This movie Cider House Rules premiered in 1999 but was based in the 1940's. This film, originally a 1985 novel by John Irving, takes place during World War II and takes a dramatically different look into the lives of different characters and how they are affected by each other. Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) is an orphan in Maine grew up under Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine). Larch passes on his medical knowledge to young Homer over the years and together they care of abandoned children. Dr. Larch performs illegal abortions, that Homer will not help with and due to a moral reservation, causing dramatics. In this film, airman Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd), is dating a girl Candy (Charlize Theron) to the Maine town for an illegal abortion. Afterwards, Homer leaves with them in order to travel and fulfill a yearning of wanting to see the planet. The events of the film take them only to state line, when they finally end up at an apple orchard owned by the airman's mother (Kate Nelligan), but Homer and Candy develop a deep bond in the absence of Wally after he must go to war. Other dramatic events take place, within the film and it takes its viewers on many ups and downs before ending, eventually Dr. Larch passes away and then causes Homer to review his life and what he believes in. This film is an American Classic that uses tricks of cinematography and lighting to create the ambiance wanted in order to allow viewers to fully experience all of the emotions filling this movie. The movie calls to a simpler day and allows the audience to get lost in its idyllic values and lifestyle of the 1940's. This movie is slightly frustrating due to the fact that when all everything seems perfect and to be going right, something happens to create subtle chaos, mixing up the plot and its characters. It was well casted, well directed and well produced. It leaves nothing to be desired, as far as movies of these genera go. The acting makes the film however, without these big names and perfect performances the film could have gone south, quickly. Although the movie was made in 1999, it does an excellent job of rewinding time in order to make the viewers get lost in the simply complex world that was the 1940's.

During the summer he meets a new girl (Kerri Green) who he falls in love with but she ends up with the popular quarterback (Charlie Sheen), which Lucas doesn't quite understand. This comedy\/drama is without question one of the best of the 80s as it features a terrific story, a great young cast and some down to Earth real moments that make it an easy classic. The screenplay by writer\/director Seltzer makes the right decision to have the characters we're watching to be realistic and smart to the situation going on. I think the script makes the right choice to have Lucas know he's a dork and know that in the real world things don't always go his way. The fact that Lucas falls in love with someone he obviously can't have makes for a lot of movies like this but this film takes it to the next level because Lucas is someone we can all identify with and the supporting players are likely people we know as well. We get the popular character, the dorky character, the popular one and the mean one. All of the characters are given enough time to fully develop where we can connect with all of them and that's why this film works so well. Most films just give us one-note characters but all of the ones here change over time and full develop as the movie unfolds. The film is smart enough to make us understand why some might not take a liking to Lucas and we even turn on him a little as his attitude towards the Green character changes. The performances are also a major plus here as we get a very talent cast and many future famous faces. Haim was born to play this role and he does a terrific job with it as he's able to capture every emotion that his character has and really nails all of them. Be it comedy, drama or romance, Haim hits all the right notes and delivers one of the more memorable performances of the decade. Both Green and Sheen are excellent and really deliver on all their scenes. We even have Jeremy Piven and Winona Ryder delivering good supporting performances. The movie follows a somewhat familiar storyline but it takes a few different spins on the familiar plot and in the end really becomes one of the more memorable films from this genre. It seems there was a different teen movie being released each and every week during the 80s and God knows there are some really bad ones out there but this one here is certainly at the top of the class in terms of heart and entertainment.

She gazes, ruefully, down a broad road leading off into the distance as she stands on the brink of where her town and general dwelling area meets wilderness; a longing look on her face and an uneasy establishment of power over a rather forlorn figure established within us. Just as you dread a Soviet era period piece set during The Second World War in which war heroism from the country's youngest and finest is at the very forefront; as the rest of those those poor, equally brave in some sense civilians stay at home and weep for the very soul of the nation; the situation and those on the front, Ballad of a Soldier actually opens up into one of the more interesting coming of age tales I've seen.The young man at the forefront of the piece is a certain private by the name of Alyosha Skvortsov (Ivashov), a boy whose war exploits would indeed make a fine story to tell any mother; friend or friend of a mother in the sense that in the heat of conflict, two Nazi tanks are wiped out by the said young man who has both the reality and responsibility of fighting on the Easatern Front thrust onto him at this early age. Following these heroic acts, Alyosha is granted a six day leave and takes it upon himself to return home in hope to complete an errand that is embedded at his family's house in the roof requiring mending. Thus begins Alyosha's travels, a sort of circular journey as he leaves the front with the intent of coming back again blended with that of a straight, singular line journey or 'road movie' as he ventures from 'A' to 'B'; discovering and finding new experiences and emotions in the process. The film is decidedly anti-war, rendering it a soulless and empty experience if a young man's coming of age adventures are explored on the travels he makes inbetween exploits of a combative ilk, and thus gradually informing us that any prior 'dread' we may have had in what to expect from this period Soviet piece, was unnecessary.The film will focus on Alyosha's travels in a minute and careful manner, observing one such instance in which the failure to identify the moment when it is apparently necessary to bribe someone, almost getting caught out and rectifying the situation before applying the said learning later on under different conditions. This trial and error process nestles in with the overall study, while Alyosha's naivety will see him, in a gleeful and euphoric mood at the time following the granting of the six day leave, happily take on the extra burden of delivering a gift from one soldier to their partner along the way; something that we will eventually come to realise merely delays the lead as well as put his life at needless risk. The extra burden of a chore is significant in the sense it is an odd job Alyosha is returning home for, and in preoccupying himself with one of someone else, risks the threat being unable to fulfil a duty set by himself - but it's all part of a learning process.If anything, Chukhrai's film victimises the 'little guy', or the poorer and more grounded characters such as Alyosha and those he encounters - it pities them and presents their situation as less than desirable; whereas stately figures such as soldiers and others of various degrees of authority are hard-nosed, seemingly uncompromising and find it rather difficult to understand the true nature of human emotion. Without giving too much away, if a particular truck impatiently loitering nearer the end knew anything about what certain people had been through up to that point, they'd surely had more remorse than they actually exhibit. Chukhrai's representation of two classes of people, worlds apart, but bound within the same nation is both sly and inspired.Rather, the film focuses on Alyosha's relationship with a young girl he meets whilst stowing away on a cargo train returning home she is Shura (Prokhorenko). The ties binding the two of them see an immediate connection, items they have in common from the offset; capturing that sense of being able to bond with someone from the offset as you come to realise the two of you are sharing the same boat, so to speak. Both are boarding the goods train without warrant; both of them will suffer the same repercussions if caught and both of them are merely trying to get to a homely place. The initial thrill, at least for the audience, in these two coming together is part-cruelly, part-wonderfully interrupted by the train's large, wooden door being torn open by a guard on the outside who then engages in talk with Alyosha, before he himself is able to renew acquaintances with Shura.The two bond as the train steams on ahead, before stopping at a number of stations, before slowly turning over and heading on out of them again. The cut away shots of the moving, travelling train representative of both characters' forward moving journey and furtherance of their development; the stop-start nature of the mode of transport in question as it pauses at regular intervals for whatever reason is representative of their initial on-off truce with one another, two stowaways in equal measure and two people forced into sharing a space throughout the development process together. The fact of the matter being that it cracks along at a tremendous rate, with, as cited by Chukhrai himself, the nervous energy from the amateur acting talent propelling what is a very beautiful and very natural progressive act caught magnificently.

Sometimes he makes good movies like (Jungle Fever), (Malcolm X). Or at worst just enjoyable ones like (Inside Man). But, on the other side, and what an other side that is, he makes weak rather stupid and aimless movies with enjoyable nothing, like (Summer of Sam), (He Got Game) or (Girl 6).The funny thing about this last bunch of movies is that it alleges a very serious case. And that what gets on your nerve badly, since the level of the movie is chokingly shitty in delivering whatever it says about such a case.I don't know. Is it vanity ? Is it the unsecured trial of new ways to tell a story ? Is it only laziness and sluggishness ? However what I do know is that I didn't conclude much of Girl 6, or enjoy anything of it as well !The matter is easy to review. We have parallel story lines that go exactly like this  a black girl who works in the sex phone business; making a living during her suspended career as respectful actress wanna-be, her talks with a guy who loves her, a good neighbor, her fantasies about herself as one of the black icons in the history of Hollywood, her dealing with her customers as horny lonely mostly sad callers, one of them is a deranged, and an accident of a black poor child who's trying to survive. Actually the movie moves so outrageously tepid from storyline to the other in what seems as arithmetical order AND THAT WAS IT !Making a movie about the sex phone business is so inspiring idea. Aside from being different &#x96; rarely seen &#x96; subject, it could read many delicate problems in one society. But with that script forget it !The effort done by (Theresa Randle) to make her character believable and effective, the movie's only positive thing, was wholly wasted among the cold dealing with the material. The movie has so artistically poor, sometimes immature, personality. There is no focusing on one pure thing. And with silent drama and uninterested camera it made me want to shut it off. The love interest's storyline was handled in originally dull way. Actually everyone and everything looked idiot. And the end, oh the end, was the top of what this movie can achieve of stupidity; the heroine goes to a cinema that shows girl 6 and there is a wide board hanging over the same street with the word The End ???!!!It's a journey from knowing that sex is needed obscenely trite whether in Hollywood or else. Women are goods to be sold for the men's desire anyhow. Or how we all live daydreams, having too hard time to fulfill them through big deranged world, or surrendering for them lastly. But as a matter of fact this movie has no clear point at all. Those were my wild guesses. So maybe it wanted to say something of them, none of them, all of them (!) Whatever its real meaning is it was shown as disarranged as all the disarranged scenes; that turned it eventually into a boring nonsense that has something serious but surely lost.This is bad movie, and a draft of real good one in the same time. Alas. Feverish P.S  did you notice how the standard of the celluloid was getting worse by the end of the scene just about every scene (with big black dots appear intermittently on the high right side of the screen) like the case with some ancient home made movies, the early poorly made new wave French films, or in the very old American ones, especially Tom & Jerry's ?! Is it a glitch? Or is it some *artistic* way from Lee to increase the size of this movie's crap ?! ","genre":null},{"date":"14 March 2010","score":"","review":" Spike Lee is one confusing filmmaker.

We have parallel story lines that go exactly like this  a black girl who works in the sex phone business; making a living during her suspended career as respectful actress wanna-be, her talks with a guy who loves her, a good neighbor, her fantasies about herself as one of the black icons in the history of Hollywood, her dealing with her customers as horny lonely mostly sad callers, one of them is a deranged, and an accident of a black poor child who's trying to survive. Actually the movie moves so outrageously tepid from storyline to the other in what seems as arithmetical order AND THAT WAS IT !Making a movie about the sex phone business is so inspiring idea. Aside from being different &#x96; rarely seen &#x96; subject, it could read many delicate problems in one society. But with that script forget it !The effort done by (Theresa Randle) to make her character believable and effective, the movie's only positive thing, was wholly wasted among the cold dealing with the material. The movie has so artistically poor, sometimes immature, personality. There is no focusing on one pure thing. And with silent drama and uninterested camera it made me want to shut it off. The love interest's storyline was handled in originally dull way. Actually everyone and everything looked idiot. And the end, oh the end, was the top of what this movie can achieve of stupidity; the heroine goes to a cinema that shows girl 6 and there is a wide board hanging over the same street with the word The End ???!!!It's a journey from knowing that sex is needed obscenely trite whether in Hollywood or else. Women are goods to be sold for the men's desire anyhow. Or how we all live daydreams, having too hard time to fulfill them through big deranged world, or surrendering for them lastly. But as a matter of fact this movie has no clear point at all. Those were my wild guesses. So maybe it wanted to say something of them, none of them, all of them (!) Whatever its real meaning is it was shown as disarranged as all the disarranged scenes; that turned it eventually into a boring nonsense that has something serious but surely lost.This is bad movie, and a draft of real good one in the same time. Alas. Feverish P.S  did you notice how the standard of the celluloid was getting worse by the end of the scene just about every scene (with big black dots appear intermittently on the high right side of the screen) like the case with some ancient home made movies, the early poorly made new wave French films, or in the very old American ones, especially Tom & Jerry's ?!

After picking up his two best friends (Corey Feldman, Michael Manasseri) they head out for what's suppose to be a good time but they hit one disaster after another. This was one of my favorite movies before I hit 16-years-old because it was always a fun movie to watch and fantasize about what my first day out with a driver's license would be like. Watching the film now I was a little surprised to see how well it stood up and especially by how many of the jokes still pack a lot of laughs. This movie was clearly made to get the two Corey's together and they do a terrific job but the main reason for this is that the screenplay is so spot on and smart in terms of what happens. I think the screenplay perfectly builds up that teen spirit of being a dork and wanting the most beautiful girl in school. It perfectly builds up all the fun stuff that one does when they get a car. It perfectly builds up the two friend characters who are constantly want to do more and more simply because they're not the ones who own the car. The performances in the films are extremely good with Haim doing a great job with the nerd role. That shyness and laid back style of his perfectly fits this character and it's really the perfect mix for all the craziness that's going on in the movie. Feldman, to no shock, plays the wilder one and the two of them blending their styles makes it easy to see why they were so popular together. Graham isn't too bad either as she gets quite a few good scenes. Another major plus is Richard Masur and Carol Kane who play Haim's parents. They are both perfect in their roles and really add a lot of great laughs and especially Masur who pretty much steals the film with his lovable bear type performance. The soundtrack is totally 80s with The Breakfast Club doing a cover of The Beatles' Drive My Car and we've got Billy Ocean's smash Get Out of My Car and even a couple Sinatra songs added for great effect. This film isn't an Oscar-winner and it will never be confused as one. It is a great throwback to the 80s with some extremely good performances and a winning screenplay and that alone makes it worth viewing.

The local islanders of Amity Island refuse to close the beaches, because they do not want to loose money produced from tourism. Therefore, the killer shark continues to attack and kill whoever goes into the water. Hence, the local sheriff takes matters into his own hands and gets the mayor to agree to hunt down the shark and kill it before anyone else turns up dead.The movie was produced in 1975 and was directed by Steven Spielberg. Robert Shaw, played Mr. Quint, the crazed, psychotic shark hunter. Matt Hooper , played by Richard Dreyfuss, was the eccentric oceanographer brought in to study and educate the town about the shark. Martin Brody, played by Roy Scheider, played Amity Island's Chief of Police who suffered from aqua-phobia. This film shows the true-life terror of the situation we put ourselves into once entering the ocean's waters. We become the prey at the bottom of the ocean's food chain.This film was acted out brilliantly and brings the viewer to edge of their seat. Steven Spielberg uses special effects in the movie that sends chills down your spine as the killer shark (a mechanical shark) lunges out of the water and attacks the unsuspecting swimmers. The shark with its dead, piercing eyes and enormous layers of razor sharp teeth grabs its prey and begins to feast in front of our very eyes. The shark reminds the audience of the real life possibility of this situation happening to them at any time they enter the ocean. The movie The Deep also uses these same scenario to alarm its audience, as abandoned divers are being feasted upon in shark invested waters.Furthermore, Spielberg uses light to bring out the terror of the true life situation. The demonic, killer shark is a nocturnal hunter; therefore, during the most intense scenes in the movie the screen is dark and a shot of light is shone right at a crucial moment in the film. This technique makes these horrifying scenes even more intense. For example, Matt Hooper dives into the water to investigate an abandoned boat owned by one of the local islanders. The scene is shot at night and the whole screen is dark except for a beam of light from his flashlight. As he investigates the boat, he shines his light on a huge chunk that has been bitten out of the side of the boat. He realizes there is a gigantic shark tooth still stuck in the boat. As he moves in to investigate the tooth further, his beam of light lands on a decapitated head as it flows out towards him. Once again, the audience is jarred with the terrifying reality of the situation.This movie was intensely thrilling and it is a true reminder of the chance we take once we enter into the domain of these gigantic, carnivorous creatures that don't mind eating us for dinner!

I admire films that aren't afraid to let their quirky-ness and originality stand out, and the films of Todd Solondz are no exception to this aspect. I love to the deepest descent that he manages perfectly too have the ability to present us with the most outrageous, shocking, and even in this case controversial situation, but at the same time gives us an extraordinary and moving piece that we can't forget whether we like it or not. So loving the films of Todd Solondz I came into Happiness hoping for the best, although if you've heard anything about the film it may be enough to scare you away, it almost did me.The thing that makes Happiness so outrageous and controversial is too many the pedophile aspect, but also perhaps how in the end we feel a strange sense of sympathy and even sorrow for a character like him, or an obscene phone caller, even for a dirty old man leaving his wife for younger women. Happiness doesn't glorify these ordeals, but instead in a very twisted sort of way kind of sort of turn them in to a joke, the kind where you don't know if it's okay to laugh, and if you do you feel even worse. Happiness manages to give us a devilishly indulging time that honestly some would do best to avoid. However I must say it's a film you don't really want to admit to yourself that you're enjoying so much, seeing how in certain scenes you can't help but feel pretty darn disturbed. The delicious diabolical humor is absolutely awesome; I like the feeling of that sort of uncomfortable humor they strongly use in this film.The film deals with the lives of three sisters, so in a way the film is three different stories. The first deals with Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle), whose neighbor is an obscene phone caller who says sexual slurs in the calls to express his lonely sexual desire and even repression. The film gives this character (played perfectly by Phillip Seymour Hoffman), an extremely fragile soul, whom we want to see succeed and find his happiness, it gets even tragically sweet at times. The Second sister Joy is the somewhat down on her luck one, she stills lives with her parents (who are in the middle of a separation) and isn't entirely open to love. I must say Jane Adam's gives a great performance, however I didn't really feel all that much sympathy or compassion for her, perhaps because she really didn't come as a person who deals with a lot. Then there is Trish who is the perfect stay at home wife, and her scenes are the scenes that will disturb you seeing how her husband Bill (played all too tragically realistic by Dylan Baker) is secretly a pedophile. Perhaps her life does focus more on Bill (as does the film), and the film doesn't shy away from the ugly truth. It's very disturbing when his pedophile side comes out (such as when he talks to his sexually curious son Billy). However honestly underneath it all it's sort of hard for us (the audience) to admit that we have a hidden liking towards him. The guilty part of it all is how we the viewer are repulsed, disturbed, but yet ironically indulged in the film. You can't look away even if you want too, but you can't, unless you're like mega sensitive towards kids or whatever. He actually is a good dad (even though it may have been his pedophile side talking), but we can't help but feel a small happiness when his son owns up to him the way he does.The direction and writing is extraordinary, and even better the performances are brilliant. I love how each woman manages to each give a different stand out performance, and stay true to their characters, as does everybody else in the film. I must say I also really admired the acting from the very brave roles such as Billy (Rufus Read), Bill (Dylan Baker), and Kristina (Camryn Manheim). It took guts to take on such roles, and why they (or anybody else in this film) didn't get Oscar nominations or recognition is beyond me.Overall I'm going to say one thing only about this film, although extraordinary and very wonderful it's a movie that is not, I repeat NOT for everybody. I would only recommend it if you are aware of some of Todd Solondz other deep meaning films (such as Palindromes or Storytelling) than you'll have an idea of what you'd get in too. I also strongly recommend to those who love films that challenge you, or that you're not afraid to be felt uncomfortable or even disturbed by a films dramatic subject matter. Happiness is a truly magnificent little film, sure very uncomfortable, but its disturbing-ness I think just enhances to the experience, and even enjoyment of this film for those who like that kind of thrill from films.

The Second sister Joy is the somewhat down on her luck one, she stills lives with her parents (who are in the middle of a separation) and isn't entirely open to love. I must say Jane Adam's gives a great performance, however I didn't really feel all that much sympathy or compassion for her, perhaps because she really didn't come as a person who deals with a lot. Then there is Trish who is the perfect stay at home wife, and her scenes are the scenes that will disturb you seeing how her husband Bill (played all too tragically realistic by Dylan Baker) is secretly a pedophile. Perhaps her life does focus more on Bill (as does the film), and the film doesn't shy away from the ugly truth. It's very disturbing when his pedophile side comes out (such as when he talks to his sexually curious son Billy). However honestly underneath it all it's sort of hard for us (the audience) to admit that we have a hidden liking towards him. The guilty part of it all is how we the viewer are repulsed, disturbed, but yet ironically indulged in the film. You can't look away even if you want too, but you can't, unless you're like mega sensitive towards kids or whatever. He actually is a good dad (even though it may have been his pedophile side talking), but we can't help but feel a small happiness when his son owns up to him the way he does.The direction and writing is extraordinary, and even better the performances are brilliant. I love how each woman manages to each give a different stand out performance, and stay true to their characters, as does everybody else in the film. I must say I also really admired the acting from the very brave roles such as Billy (Rufus Read), Bill (Dylan Baker), and Kristina (Camryn Manheim). It took guts to take on such roles, and why they (or anybody else in this film) didn't get Oscar nominations or recognition is beyond me.Overall I'm going to say one thing only about this film, although extraordinary and very wonderful it's a movie that is not, I repeat NOT for everybody. I would only recommend it if you are aware of some of Todd Solondz other deep meaning films (such as Palindromes or Storytelling) than you'll have an idea of what you'd get in too. I also strongly recommend to those who love films that challenge you, or that you're not afraid to be felt uncomfortable or even disturbed by a films dramatic subject matter. Happiness is a truly magnificent little film, sure very uncomfortable, but its disturbing-ness I think just enhances to the experience, and even enjoyment of this film for those who like that kind of thrill from films.

The lines voiced by the actors are superb, but some of the unspoken communication is even better. Even the leopard (a jaguar, actually, as would be expected from a South American origin) was great, and one beautiful cat, as was the terminally annoying little yappydog that I was hoping Baby would eat.

For in this case Bess, played by an unforgettably moving Emily Watson, is that character, a woman who prays everyday, and is married to a kind oil-rigger, Jan, played by an equally good Stellan Sarsgaard. She loves him unconditionally, and is perhaps a little too attached like a child she pouts and gets a little more than upset over his leaving back to work on the rig. But he's gone, and she tries to deal, until he gets in an accident with a pipe hitting him. He's paralyzed, and there's little hope he will walk again, or do anything again. Bess still loves Jan, and will do anything for him... which, as it turns out, extends to something unconscionable, which is to sleep with other men so he can somehow have a connection with her.Makes little sense, and Jan is quite possibly mad himself. But Bess has no real firm faculty of how to choose things for herself, or choose what is really common sense. The unfortunate tragedy, underlying a lot of what happens to her and to the town's reaction to her, is her religious upbringing influences her more than anything. It may be a harsh point made by Lars von Trier, but it's an effective one she's been inundated with fervent religion since she was a child, and now as an adult, following other tragedy (she lost a sibling years before), she's just a little 'off'. Bess says at one point, flat-out, that she's stupid, but it's all too easy an out. I think von Trier's point is that she would be perfectly capable of herself in choosing what to do in light of Jan's own tragedy. Instead, she kneels in a church or elsewhere, like Danny with 'Tony' in The Shining, talking in one innocent voice and then another that is darker, harsher, an unforgiving God inside her head.The sickness is pervasive, is what Breaking the Waves means to tell us, but this is not spelled out in big letters. It's something that a viewer can come to him\/herself. And, oddly enough despite von Trier's own feelings on religion, watching the film I get the sense that believers won't mind. In fact, there's something of a spiritual nature going on in the picture, that could be read as being, ultimately, uplifting amid the dread and further tragedy that befalls Bess. It's like the director has taken his main influence here, Carl Dreyer, and infused him into a modern cinema that is urgent and alive, set in the 1970's with the occasional rock song coming in, and a hand-held camera marking it akin to a Cassavetes picture from the period. But whatever the influence, it's this director all the way, every painstaking minute and carefully composed, frantic-emotional shot.It's a startling film because of its subject matter, putting a whole new urgency and matter into a relationship drama and infidelity crisis (not to mention that of what is supposedly wrong in the mind), and how strong the performances are. I might have teared up a few times during the film if only due to Watson's immersion into Bess. She is Bess, after a short while, full of her liveliness and worry, her common and uncommon need to cry and pout, her determination to love at whatever cost. She's sympathetic, despite everything, since she's so frighteningly human and recognizable in her vulnerability, an innocent figure cast in the society of a frowning church and public who witnesses her decline to service for her husband without barely lifting a finger. And not for a moment did I not believe in Bess because I believed in Watson, and how far she would be willing to go in von Trier's text. Sarsgaard does similar work, though is not as present since he's in a full-body cast (still, very subtle, great work, just in the face and voice).It's certainly not an easy film to take in - it's about as sunny as a 'Silence-of-God' period Bergman, and its conclusion leaves only the slightest of bittersweet resolution - but it's power to wrap a viewer in its protagonist's plight is extraordinary. It reveals von Trier, more than any other of his films really, as a serious artist concerned with the fragility of the human condition, its power to corrupt and its delicacy at being both decent (the doctor) and twisted (Udo Kier's bit part).

And this effort by Christopher Guest and pals certainly hits the target, though it isn't quite a bullseye. Best in Show is a mockumentary about five show dogs and their often eccentric owners competing in what appears to be the Super Bowl of dogs shows in Philadelphia. More often than not it makes you laugh, and it certainly makes you feel sorry for the dogs in these kinds of shows.Director Christopher Guest plays a redneck owner of an enormous bloodhound from North Carolina. This is obviously a lonely guy with maybe a few too many hobbies. We also see him as a ventriloquist, a guy who can name every kind of nut there is, and he even runs a bait shop. After the competition, he even takes a jaunt to Israel to work on one of those collective farms they have. Other contestants are a pampered standard poodle owned by a trophy wife and trained by her lesbian lover, one of a pair of tiny shi-tzus owed by a flamingly gay couple of guys, a shaggy terrier owned by a borderline white trash couple from Florida, and some other odd kind of dog owned by an annoying yuppie couple. The camera just seems to follow these people and their dogs around while the characters spout mostly improvised dialog as if they were really being interviewed instead of acting. Its good for a lot of laughs.The redneck and the gay men get most of the laughs. Guest went to great depths to depict his Harlan Pepper character as a man with just too much going on in his own head and too much time on his hands. Michael McKeon and John Michael Higgins are good as the gay men. Maybe a little too good! Jennifer Coolidge (Stifler's mom for those of you American Pie fans) and Jane Lynch have characters that at least keep you guessing for a while about the true meaning of their relationship. I think I recognized the old codger who played Blue in Old School as Coolidge's husband! The film doesn't quite strike gold with the other two dog owning couples, though. Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock are WAY too over-the-top as the yuppies. They could have been fitfully annoying without the tantrums. Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy are believable lower income Floridians, but the script overdoes it in ramming the point home about her promiscuity. And their dog seemed the least likely to win.

More often than not it makes you laugh, and it certainly makes you feel sorry for the dogs in these kinds of shows.Director Christopher Guest plays a redneck owner of an enormous bloodhound from North Carolina. This is obviously a lonely guy with maybe a few too many hobbies. We also see him as a ventriloquist, a guy who can name every kind of nut there is, and he even runs a bait shop. After the competition, he even takes a jaunt to Israel to work on one of those collective farms they have. Other contestants are a pampered standard poodle owned by a trophy wife and trained by her lesbian lover, one of a pair of tiny shi-tzus owed by a flamingly gay couple of guys, a shaggy terrier owned by a borderline white trash couple from Florida, and some other odd kind of dog owned by an annoying yuppie couple. The camera just seems to follow these people and their dogs around while the characters spout mostly improvised dialog as if they were really being interviewed instead of acting. Its good for a lot of laughs.The redneck and the gay men get most of the laughs.

Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock are WAY too over-the-top as the yuppies. They could have been fitfully annoying without the tantrums. Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy are believable lower income Floridians, but the script overdoes it in ramming the point home about her promiscuity. And their dog seemed the least likely to win.

Even more so to call it cyberpunk. I just have trouble believing that just because you incorporate a few elements of sci-fi and film-noir detective genres in a near-future setting, it is just automatically cyberpunk. And even just to call it science fiction... the supposed overall premise that the world could end due to a nuclear satellite destabilizing is not actually particularly science fiction (nor even hardly realistically scientifically plausible) but it's pretty much completely ignored for the entire movie, so what does it matter. likewise, the device is little more than a generic MacGuffin for most of the film, and when they finally do get into it, it is with the shallowest, most cursory glossing over of any interesting exploration of the concepts, remaining little more than a MacGuffin still; a random crux for some ridiculous, muddled new-age psycho-babble philosophical wanking, which doesn't really go anywhere or last very long; just seems to be a random way of ending that part of the film. Anyway, if you really were interested in checking out some real sci-fi about topics such as these, you could so easily do SOOO much better, so don't get roped into watching this just because the sci-fi aspect sounds interesting. about the only interesting thing in that regard is that they somehow managed to predict modern automobile sat-nav units pretty much exactly!! So, all that out of the way, this movie is obviously VERY long. I am almost curious that a better edited version could be more interesting, but I don't really see how that's possible. It's the content, not the length, that failed to keep my interest. I did find it pretty interesting in the beginning, enjoyed the bit in Japan, and the Australia where most of the rest of the film took place seemed remarkably realistic and down to earth compared to typical depictions, so that was somewhat interesting.But in general it just wandered nowhere so aimlessly... I doubt it's true, but I really got the feel that they were just making this up as they went along past the initial setup, and really could not figure out where to take it without writing around in circles, into corners, through ridiculous plot-holes, trailing loose ends all along the way.Of course, this wouldn't be so bad considering Wenders' penchant for stunning, timeless cinematography, directing, pacing, and phenomenally real, alive, emotionally transparent acting... but shockingly none of that is in evidence here! about all this albatross has going for it is a few interesting characters, a few pretty good minor actors, and a rather cute, intriguing leading lady, but even that wasn't nearly enough to carry it past the first two hours.The use of various languages could have been interesting, but I just found it jarring and unnatural. While it seems that many of the actors were pretty gifted in at least one language, they end up speaking a lot in other languages, particularly English, in which their performance seemed severely curtailed. Absurdly enough, the well established American actors actually tend to give some of the most wooden, hokey, unbelievable deliveries in English on here! And i generally do like them in other films I've seen.It's all pretty inexplicable. I can't find myself believing most of what takes place in this film. Other reviews on IMDb have pointed out a few of the ridiculous plot holes and pointlessly unrealistic plot twists, and I'm not much inspired to suffer remembering it to point out more; there are PLENTY.But even when you ignore these technical blunders, the main dramatic story line just makes no sense to me whatsoever. Why does she suddenly fall in love with some random guy just because she runs into him on her little adventure, gives him a ride, and he steals some of her money? i certainly see no chemistry or connection whatsoever between them at that point; it's completely out of nowhere. And she's instantly completely obsessed with him and it becomes her life-consuming mission to stalk him literally to the ends of the earth, not even to get back at him, but to have sex with him and save him from... she has no clue what from? As stupidly as I have seen some women behave, I can not believe that she would keep this up after risking her life only to be used, stolen from again, and ditched the first SEVERAL TIMES! And why the heck would he keep doing this and conceal the device and his motives completely from her, when it turns out later he really is such a nice guy? So there you have it, pretty consistently horrendous acting, not much special visually, a tangled, moth eaten plot that drags on forever going nowhere for no particular reason, fairly uninteresting characters who make no sense, self-inconsistencies and loose threads out the wazoo, and not really that much in the music department as far as I'm concerned. A huge disappointment from the director of one of my very favoritest movies ever! What a drag.I'm not sure what to recommend as a much better, alternative to this film with relatable themes or elements, but definitely check out Wings of Desire, and maybe some appealing works by Kieslowski, Tarkovsky, Wong Kar-wai, maybe even Fellini...

And it really does have all the subtle elements in the writing and acting to give this power even to insider Hollywood pros. Or especially to people who really know and love movies.

The young and powerful presence of Kirk Douglas adds a new casual twist to the mobster boss stereotype--he's likable without that caricature mob styling of other noirs. The good woman is especially tragic, and believable, too, in the form of little known Virginia Houston (who makes a bookend to her career in the fabulous Sudden Fear five years later). There are some novelties to the movie as a noir type, mainly the outdoor setting for some of the main scenes. But there is plenty of urban night stuff, and the more common (and well crafted) relationships between detectives and mobsters and the women above. The photography is classic dramatic stuff--watch near the very end how the camera follows Mitchum to one side of the car, the girl gets in, and then it glides across the front to watch him come around and get in the other side. This is so fluid and slight, you never really pay attention, but it's part of the slick way the movie makers keep the continuity and the verisimilitude at a high, dramatic pitch.

The director, it should be noted, is French born Jacques Tourneur, who made a number of interesting films (including the famous Cat People) as well as many B-movies.

They had a tried and true successful formula with a likable protagonist in a setting where the underdog had to overcome long odds to come out a winner. It's no different here, and Stallone manages to get it all done in under two hours. The fresh aspect offered in this film involve the Hulk Hogan appearance as a pro wrestling heel, and the presence of Mr.T in the flick that would propel him to 'Pity the Fool' stardom. I would have liked to see Burgess Meredith carry on as Mickey, but death in movies isn't always what it seems. You've got Rocky V to attest to that.So this is the Rocky film in which Stallone is really ripped due to a personal training regimen, and perhaps owing somewhat to that 'Eye of the Tiger' theme song that we hear repeatedly.

This rather limp summer camp comedy tries to coast by on Cory Feldman's deteriorating star power. It concerns Camp Lakeview's competition with a more successful affluent Camp Twin Oaks. Bug-eyed Jack Nance stars as Neil Peterson, Lakeview's owner who is facing a mortgage crisis, approached by Twin Oaks' Monica Shavetts(Sarah Douglas)to sell his camp so she can turn it into a golf course. He hires Ricky Wade(Feldman)to help turn things around as the annual water ski meet is on the horizon between Lakeview and Twin Oaks. This fourth film in the tired Meatballs series doesn't have an inspired joke in it's arsenal, and only has hot girls and naked breasts to atone for the lackluster material. Lots of water sports stunts, with Feldman pulling another Michael Jackson dance session that was as cumbersome as the dying summer camp comedy whose heyday had long passed after the 80's was over. The cast, to their credit, gives it their best shot, but the screenplay doesn't do them any favors. It is, after all, about the laughs and when I found myself dozing off periodically, having not even giggled out loud once, I knew that Meatballs 4 was officially the final nail in the coffin of a franchise that never should've existed to begin with. There is a clumsy large fellow whose size and easy-going nature is the butt of jokes,allowed to save the day for our heroes and gets the chick at the end, so maybe this tells you all you need to know about the movie. Of course, Shavetts is an underhanded wealthy woman determined to see she attains the rights to Lakeview(..and Ricky)so she'll use every sneaky technique possible, including her two hired goons who wreak havoc on the summer campers, in turn causing those perturbed to leave for home. Nance looks as if he'd been sniffing glue, during his many scenes with Feldman. Feldman is having relationship problems with Nance's granddaughter after leaving for a momentary stint to Twin Oaks. Feldman hopes to save the camp so that she can be in charge of it when Nance passes on. Feldman, of course, is a talented water skier who hopes to accomplish a historic triple flip in order to win the stunt competition. Thanks to Shavetts, they will have to overcome chicanery and cheating in order to do so.

However Maggie sees Carl assassinated & she barely escapes with her life, Maggie is to catch the Concorde to Moscow via Paris the next morning & intends to blow the whistle on Harrison who also happens to be her boyfriend which would ruin him. Determined to save himself he reprogrammes his hi-tech 'Buzzard' homing missile to intercept & destroy the Concorde during a test run killing all those on-board & destroying the documented evidence...Renamed Airport '80 - The Concorde for it's cinema & initial home video releases because it was released here in, well, 1980 rather than 1979 this last entry in the Airport franchise was directed by David Lowell Rich & is a notoriously bad film that was apparently laughed at during press & test screenings prompting Universal to promote the film as an action comedy. The first thing to say is that The Concorde ... Airport '79 is a really silly & downright daft film but on a purely entertainment basis I can think of a lot worse films to spend 108 minutes watching, I really can. I quite liked the absurd plot about a wealthy industrialist wanting to kill his girlfriend TV reporter before she can expose him as an illegal arms dealer but this guy doesn't do subtle & decides the best way to do it is to blow Concorde up with his own guided missile & then gets a Fench fighter pilot to try & shoot it down before finally sabotaging it so really there's three mini disaster flicks in one here as each time super pilot Joe Patroni manages to save the day. You know Joe Patroni played by George Kennedy appears in all four Airport films & goes from mechanic in the first to Concorde pilot extrodinaire in this, also I reckon he's a bit of a jinx since in the space of nine years he has been involved with four major aviation disasters. I think the real reason why the Airport series stopped here was because Patroni retired after this & the jinx was lifted. Some of the things that happen here are just silly, Patroni does barrel rolls, flies upside-down & out manoeuvre's a guided missile in a huge Concorde not to mention he crash lands it & fires flare guns out of his window to destroy the missile all while keeping a calm head. This guy is good, very good. Then there's the character's, there's a Saxophone playing black dude who smokes weed in the toilets, an old woman with a bladder problem & a team of Russian gymnasts with bad accents. Also, despite being almost shot down with a missile & then attacked by a Jet fighter the passengers of Concorde don't seem that bothered & happily get back aboard the following day, I don't know about you but after that I would probably find a safer way to travel & why do the police or authorities not question anyone? Why is the Concorde captain Patroni allowed to just go off & sleep with a French prostitute? The Concorde ... Airport '79 certainly isn't boring & is full of memorable moments & I was entertained in a way although it's far from a good film & modern audiences may not have the patience with it, hell I liked it for what it was in a daft way but it's no sort of classic.Even though Concorde no longer flies it's still quite a cool looking air-plane & there's plenty of footage of it here, the one used in The Concorde ... Airport '79 was the seventh one built. This Concorde was also the same aircraft which crashed after a tire bust caused a fuel tank to rupture and the leaking fuel catch fire on July 25th 2000, while taking off in Paris sadly resulting in the death of 109 passengers and crew on board and 4 people on the ground. When this aired on TV in the US in 1982 almost twenty minutes of new footage was included with most if not all of it being newly shot over two years after the original production had finished. I know the effects here take a bashing from most but I don't reckon they are too bad, when you consider this was made in the late 70's I think they come across quite well. The camera moves during effects shots, real footage of real planes is used rather than toy models which in my opinion would have looked a lot worse & I could certainly see what the makers were trying to do with limited funds & limited technology. In a strange way they are quite impressive actually without ever looking that good if you know what I mean. Probably the most action packed of all the Airport films there's missiles, exploding planes, daring crash landings, assassinations & a guy named Robert Palmer (no, not the singer) giving head a woman in a jacuzzi.The IMDb says this had a budget of about $14,000,000 which is actually more than I thought, maybe those special effects aren't so impressive after all. Shot in Utah, Washington, Los Angeles & France. The acting isn't great here, people don't look worried enough that they are about to die.
