Edward Woodward is great as Sergeant Howie, and the people of Summerisle all play their parts, from the main parts of Summerisle to the people that you see for just a few seconds. However, if anyone, it is Christopher Lee that steals the show. He is, above anything else, a wonderful actor, and has been for just as long as most people can remember. He seems to know a lot about his characters, and this is no exception. Despite the limited amount of screen time that he gets, he is flat out phenomenal.Another thing that I must point out is the music. A couple of the songs in this movie may seem sweet, but don't be fooled there is definitely a creepy tone to each and every one of the songs.All in all, a great movie. The acting, the behind-the-scenes crew, and everybody else all do a great job here. See this over the crappy Nicholas Cage re-make; it is much more satisfying to watch.

Sure there's a ton of screaming, bickering, and profanity, not to mention, obnoxious characters who have a tendency to get on your nerves because they aren't exactly (or some of them, anyway) the most likable bunch.The situation itself, a fight for survival after the dead rise from their graves with a desperate hunger for brains to ease their never ending suffering (it is painful when you are dead and brains help to stave off the suffering as told to us by an upper torso zombie tied to a gurney when questioned), is, I think, the main appeal for this movie. Many zombie films have that sense of apocalyptic doom, but I think Dan O'Bannon's horror comedy gets that just right, in a tongue-in-cheek manner. Does the acting get a wee bit over-the-top? I'll just say that nothing holds James Karen back&#x97;he lets it all hang out with a performance steeped in campy theatrics. One thing, from this most recent viewing, I got a great sense of was the agony of dying yet remaining alive enough to feel the change in how Karen and Thom Matthews present to us the unending torture such suffering seems to be.The punks of the film (such as Miguel A. Núñez Jr., Brain Peck, and Mark Venturini) aren't exactly the most sympathetic bunch, the way they spout non-stop obscenities, rarely offering anything remotely attainable to an audience to care about their plight. Linnea Quigley's striptease and dance on the crypt in Resurrection Cemetery (what a cool and wickedly genius name for the cemetery!) is definitely one of those highlights perfectly etched in my memory since I saw it at an age when the beauty of a naked woman started to gain importance in my mind and libido (kudos to the actress for going all the way and remaining pretty much topless throughout her entire screen time). With a supporting cast like Clu Galagher (as the owner of the medical supply warehouse housing the canisters containing corpses with a chemical that awoke them from their dead sleep), James Karen (as the warehouse operator who spins tales to his young protégé, Freddy (Thom Mathews, who wide-eyed naiveté is perfect bait for an aging storyteller who loves to spook those willing to believe his stories), and Don Calfa (as the German Mortician who explains in detail the process of rigor mortis, carries on his person a German luger, and has a crematorium that seems like the ideal tool to get rid of moving dangerous zombie body parts), The Return of the Living Dead was certain to maintain a cult following because it is hard to keep a straight face with such absurd subject matter without the kind of actors who could sell scenes like the pick ax head stabbing and eventual hacksaw decapitation of a run-amok corpse kept in a freezer for college campuses to study, or a split dog used in veterinarian schools that is barking. With memorable moments feeding lines like Send more paramedics or Send more cops from zombies to headquarters to get more fresh brains for their disposal, where the undead attack helpless police and paramedics called to the cemetery, unknowingly walking into their gruesome demise, it is not hard to understand why this movie has had a lasting impact over several decades. The practical effects, particularly the memorable zombies like Tarman and the female skeletal upper torso that bites a chunk out of the skull of character Scuz, are the real stars of this film, if you ask me. The movement of Tarman is neat and the scene where the female upper torso is questioned by Calfa on why zombies need brains is actually rather tragic and sad (as is Karen's decision to use the crematorium to end it all) is movie magic at its finest.

She doesn't even seem aware she's the one singlehandedly carrying the flick on her shoulders--as from the beginning Bowie makes for a most nonthreatening villain--so if any lingering tension we'll find along, that will have to come from another source and that may only be the difficulties and setbacks Sarah finds in her quest. We may even say her real adversary is the Labyrinth itself, not Bowie's king of the goblins.Labyrinth is a pleasure to watch if only for the amazing skills shown by everyone involved, from the writers to the puppet designers to the people animating them and, most of all, to the director.

But what's most engaging in this movie is its pervading innocence. Even in the most angry or desperate moments for our Sarah--as when she tries to escape from The Cleaners--there's no evil or cruelty in the mood, atmosphere; it all happens as if this was just an inoffensive physical game.Henson had the unique gift of introducing us to a world where a single piece of fabric cut & sewed in a certain way, filled with the fingers of a skilled hand, could give birth to a wholly unforgettable character, one many times with a more distinctive personality than any played by real actors and with charisma to burn.

As a teenager, I think young men (and women, for that matter) often come across certain films which awaken lust for the first time. Crampton and Linnea Quigley (by way of The Return of the Living Dead) were two of the first lust desires I remember as a teenager. They were visions in my fantasies, and it was horror films that led to this sexual awakening in me. But back to Re-Animator, this film is a spin on the mad scientist sub-genre horror that goes way back to Frankenstein, as Jeffrey Combs' Dr. Herbert West is just an extension of Dr. Frankenstein, with a desire to give the dead life and, in the process, be the one responsible for a great discovery. But doing this, playing God, if you will, always ends badly for any scientist who attempts to practice science that involves reanimating the dead. This film shows that West's green liquid, a reagent he calls it, has really violent side effects&#x97;those dead injected with the reagent always return as animal savages, primitive in behavior going after people that are in their trajectory. Of course, the fly in the ointment besides the negative reactions from guinea pigs injected, is brain surgeon, Professor Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale), actually a psychopath who harbours a deeply disturbing obsessive desire for Miskitonic University's Dean Alan Halsey's college-aged daughter, Megan (Barbara Crampton) who stole ideas from a mentor of West's (a German scientist we see suffering a grotesque reaction to West's reagent in Switzerland). Hill likes to steal from others so that he can reap the accolades and rewards to further enhance his own reputation and career (although he does invent a truly evil form of laser lobotomy that provides him with the ability to control humans experimented on) and plans to do the same thing with West's reanimation reagent. We follow the destruction of the potential of Bruce Abbot's promising, bright medical student, Daniel Cain, who has the unfortunate fate of renting his basement to West, entering a partnership with the scientist that returns disastrous consequences to his life and student career. You can't help but scream at Cain to cut ties with West, because only bad can come from aligning himself with someone who only cares about success of his experiment&#x97;no matter who else gets hurt and the damage caused to innocents caught in the middle of the dangerous effects of the reagent.The make-up effects have always been amazing to me. There's a no boundaries approach that I admire about the gore such as the decapitated head stuck on a paper weight in a bed pan (a shovel used to separate the head from the body!), the bone saw used to penetrate the chest of a massive muscular corpse that kills Dean Halsey, the headless walking torso carrying its disembodied head around, the eerie corpses of a burn victim and one with a shot gun blast to the face that look so incredibly accurate that run amok, and the manic dead cat that is torn practically in half rising from a table after the reagent awakens itThe absurdity of these gore sequences play in the film's favor because of the fantasy element of the mad science involved in the screenplay&#x97;the ability for the corpses and reanimated body parts to move about and raise havoc is due to West's amazing experimental breakthrough, but the results offer nothing but tragedy. Despite the film's sense of dark body part and corpse humor, there's also a dramatic arc I think adds a unique heart to the movie and that is the relationship of Meg and Dan, how it is ripped apart by Herbert West, with a desperate, misguided decision made out of heartbreak and loss to use the reagent we know will not end well.The most notorious scene involves a naked Megan, stripped by her lobotomized father, at the request of demented Hill (whose head is guiding his separated body), bound to a gurney and almost sexually molested&#x97;response to this scene could be met with either horror or arousal.

As I see it, this film ranks up there with GHOST BUSTERS, BACK TO THE FUTURE, and the INDIANA JONES (original) trilogy as one of the most memorable films of the '80s. It's entertaining for both kids and adults, equal parts loony and suspenseful. Based on a mystery novel by Gary K. Wolf (which I'm now reminded I really want to read), the film is set in a world where cartoons and real life coexists side-by-side, also known as every kid's dream. Cartoon characters inhabit a colorful world known as Toontown that somehow exists next to Los Angeles (awfully convenient, really). The movie is a wacky adventure mixed with film noir set in the late 1940s. Private detective Eddie Valiant is hired to trail the wife of famed cartoon star Roger Rabbit and prove that she's having an affair with cartoon gadget mogul Marvin Acme. Roger doesn't respond to the news well and, when Marvin Acme turns up dead, Roger's the number one suspect. Roger pleads with Valiant, a toon-hater since the day one dropped a piano on his brother's head, to help clear his name and protect him from the brooding Judge Doom. Doom has developed a chemical mixture known as dip and it's the only real means of killing a toon, which he appears to do with great pleasure. Valiant is the one man who can clear Roger's name, find Acme's true killer, and unravel a conspiracy that may result in the end of Toontown.If you've somehow gone this long without seeing this movie, there's something wrong with you and you need to remedy it as soon as possible. It doesn't matter how old a person is, there's something here for everyone. For example, it's the only time we've been able to see the world's most beloved cartoon characters from all major studios come together in the same film Mickey Mouse skydiving with Bugs Bunny, Donald and Daffy Duck in a piano battle, etc. It's enough to blow a kid's mind and nostalgic enough that anyone who grew up on these cartoons will get a kick out of it. That's not to say the movie is all cartoon zaniness. I'll be honest and I'm sure I'm not the only one who can say that Judge Doom scared the ever-loving crap out of me when I was younger. Christopher Lloyd is down-right creepy as the film's antagonist, dressed all in black with an evil deliberate feel to every move he makes. The scene in the Acme Warehouse where he demonstrates the effectiveness of his dip on a cartoon shoe is pretty messed up when you think about it. He dips the shoe into the toxic mixture and when he pulls his gloved hand out of the barrel, it's covered in goopy red ink\/paint to really drive home the point that he just killed the toon. And don't get me started on the final act where Valiant confronts the villain. I'll spare excessive details for the uninitiated, but I was four-years-old when the movie came and I still remember how terrified I was. I'm just saying.The characters in this movie have become iconic Roger Rabbit, Baby Herman, and especially Jessica Rabbit (who's been widely recognized as the hottest cartoon creation ever, no doubt due in part to Kathleen Turner's vocal performance). They may never be as widely beloved as the classic characters (Mickey, Bugs, etc.) but they left their mark on my childhood just the same. Judge Doom is a crazy S.O.B. and ranks as one of my all-time favorite movie villains, and Bob Hoskins is a great sport for all the craziness as Eddie Valiant. The story is complex enough for an adult audience with some older humor sprinkled in for the grown-ups to get a laugh and the kids get a zany ride in a world where cartoons are real.

Wolf (which I'm now reminded I really want to read), the film is set in a world where cartoons and real life coexists side-by-side, also known as every kid's dream. Cartoon characters inhabit a colorful world known as Toontown that somehow exists next to Los Angeles (awfully convenient, really). The movie is a wacky adventure mixed with film noir set in the late 1940s. Private detective Eddie Valiant is hired to trail the wife of famed cartoon star Roger Rabbit and prove that she's having an affair with cartoon gadget mogul Marvin Acme. Roger doesn't respond to the news well and, when Marvin Acme turns up dead, Roger's the number one suspect. Roger pleads with Valiant, a toon-hater since the day one dropped a piano on his brother's head, to help clear his name and protect him from the brooding Judge Doom. Doom has developed a chemical mixture known as dip and it's the only real means of killing a toon, which he appears to do with great pleasure. Valiant is the one man who can clear Roger's name, find Acme's true killer, and unravel a conspiracy that may result in the end of Toontown.If you've somehow gone this long without seeing this movie, there's something wrong with you and you need to remedy it as soon as possible. It doesn't matter how old a person is, there's something here for everyone. For example, it's the only time we've been able to see the world's most beloved cartoon characters from all major studios come together in the same film Mickey Mouse skydiving with Bugs Bunny, Donald and Daffy Duck in a piano battle, etc. It's enough to blow a kid's mind and nostalgic enough that anyone who grew up on these cartoons will get a kick out of it. That's not to say the movie is all cartoon zaniness. I'll be honest and I'm sure I'm not the only one who can say that Judge Doom scared the ever-loving crap out of me when I was younger. Christopher Lloyd is down-right creepy as the film's antagonist, dressed all in black with an evil deliberate feel to every move he makes. The scene in the Acme Warehouse where he demonstrates the effectiveness of his dip on a cartoon shoe is pretty messed up when you think about it. He dips the shoe into the toxic mixture and when he pulls his gloved hand out of the barrel, it's covered in goopy red ink\/paint to really drive home the point that he just killed the toon. And don't get me started on the final act where Valiant confronts the villain. I'll spare excessive details for the uninitiated, but I was four-years-old when the movie came and I still remember how terrified I was. I'm just saying.The characters in this movie have become iconic Roger Rabbit, Baby Herman, and especially Jessica Rabbit (who's been widely recognized as the hottest cartoon creation ever, no doubt due in part to Kathleen Turner's vocal performance). They may never be as widely beloved as the classic characters (Mickey, Bugs, etc.) but they left their mark on my childhood just the same. Judge Doom is a crazy S.O.B. and ranks as one of my all-time favorite movie villains, and Bob Hoskins is a great sport for all the craziness as Eddie Valiant. The story is complex enough for an adult audience with some older humor sprinkled in for the grown-ups to get a laugh and the kids get a zany ride in a world where cartoons are real. No offense to BACK TO THE FUTURE and it's massive fan base (of which I'm a part), but I think this film is Robert Zemeckis' best.

Luckily, Hercule Poirot is on the boat, and along with his partner the Colonel, he begins work on the difficult case.

I haven't read the original novel, nor anything else by Agatha Christie(although I would love to), and cannot draw any comparisons. This is a clever, taut mystery that has you guessing. I was rather surprised by the twist(which does not negate anything that has happened prior to it, and makes perfect sense with the rest of the movie), but at the same time, it definitely provides clues along the way, and there may be those who can figure it out. If one wishes to do so, they will have to watch this closely. The characters are memorable, distinct and well-written, and you have little if any trouble telling them apart(without them being exaggerated), in spite of there being about a dozen. This is due to both the carefully conceived script(every line of dialog is delicious) and the acting(albeit this can be over the top some of the time, particularly for Lansbury and Warden, who have a slight tendency to play their roles in this like stereotypes... this happens with the others, as well, though these two are the worst offenders, and it still isn't that big of a deal), and everyone is well-cast. Niven, MacCorkindale, Chiles and Farrow are among the best. Ustinov nails it as the famous detective. The humor is fitting in amount and tone. This is well-filmed, and makes great use of the gorgeous setting for its photography. It treats the culture with respect, if it can be a tad racist against the people. Whether this was due to the year it was produced, or it reflected the book that it adapted, however, it's not very prevalent at all. This has a genuine classic feel to it.

It remains one of my favorite ones to watch for a number of reasons.1) It has EVERYTHING! Action, comedy, drama, suspense, revenge, fairy- tales, heroes, villains, pirates, giants, miracle men, even rodents of unusual size. There is a reason it is always among the list of Best Movies, Funniest Movies, and Best Love Stories of All Time. 2) The CAST. Hard to name a more fitting princess than the beautiful Robin Wright, Cary Elwes can sweep you off your feet as a farmboy or a masked man, Mandy Patinkin delivers the most memorable quote of his career, and the rest of the ensemble transport you into their magical world.3) It has ROBIN WRIGHT in it! Did I say that already?4) It brings out the KID in me and the nostalgia of those days. If only for two hours you can go to a distant land and be on an adventure and feel positive and young again. 5) It has plenty of MEMORABLE LINES and scenes. SOME MISSES - SPECIAL EFFECTS are pretty lame, even by 80's standards (the rodents could not have been more fake and some of the props are sub-standard) - STORY Predictable and full of clichés - SCRIPT\/DIALOGUE While there are numerous memorable lines, they are repeated too frequently throughout the course of the movie. The script was simplistic. And to be objective, not too funny for most adults. - ACTING There isn't much depth to any of the characters but the script didn't give the actors much to work with, for starters. Younger audiences may not notice it, but older ones may cringe in some scenes - CHEESE FACTOR oh boy, it has plenty.

Movies of this sort are not made very often. They are very abstract and have melancholiness pervading them. Also, these movie are very niche; a majority of the audience will not appreciate their aesthetic value. Despite these seeming demerits, Magnolia is one of the most beautiful and compelling movies I have seen. Primarily a film about people, emotions and coincidences, Magnolia is a story that revolves around multiple characters. It jumps from person to person, trying its best to showcase how one small act of one person affects others at large. In the initial scenes, the narrator speaks of three peculiar coincidences that have now become urban legends, establishing the tone of the movie. Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) is the host of the television show 'What Do Kids Know?' and he is about to die. His daughter, Claudia (Melora Walters), is a drug-addict and hates her father. Donnie Smith (William Macy), a grown-up gay wimp who wants to get braces for the sole purpose of impressing a male bartender, is a former child-prodigy and participant of the aforementioned quiz show. Stanley (Jeremy Blackman), an immensely intelligent kid, is a current participant on the show who has an obsessive, cold and demanding man for a father. Phil (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a male nurse attending to a bed-ridden old man dying of cancer named Earl Partridge (Jason Robards). Linda (Julianne Moore) is Earl's young, frustrated wife; his second, for the record. Earl also has a son, Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), who has deserted him. Earl's dying wish is to meet his son. But Frank despises him. He is a cocky, megalomaniac almost misogynistic man who gives sex- seminars called Seduce and Destroy. Jim (John Reilly) is an earnest, hard-working police officer, living a single, lonely life. He is genuinely kind and wants to do good for the world. Jim ends up on Claudia's doorstep and falls in love with her, closing all characters into a, abstract yet magnificent loop. But there is more to this than first impressions convey. Besides the ones mentioned, there are even more characters in the story that have been given a considerable amount of screen time who play their part in the film. While it may appear like the proverbial 'too many cooks spoil the broth,' the case is not so. Director Paul Thomas Anderson gives sufficient screen-time to all the actors. They all have a job to do in the movie. The lead actors too aren't not just characterless, undefined gooey blobs, but working, functioning human beings. They have emotions, histories and are no more contrived than in real life. Every one of them doesn't meet the other, yet unknowingly, they affect each others' lives.All the performances are marvelous, which is a must in a movie that focuses on humans. Feelings are handled like infants; delicately and with care. The film works on emotions brilliantly. The characters are each a farrago of emotions - angst, sympathy, depression and even the occasional bout of happiness. You feel for each one of them as they tackle their personal demons. Each has a past or present that haunts him. Jimmy Gator is haunted by the things that occurred between him and his daughter. Donnie Smith by his extinct brilliance and his closet homosexuality. Stanley is depressed by the way his father treats him. Linda is resentful of cheating on Earl and loves him now that he is dying. However, the most touching of them all is the past of Frank. It isn't long before you realize that his current behaviour is a merely facade created by something that happened long back and there is something deep within that is bothering him. Tom Cruise carries this role perfectly, and tops it off with a goose-bumps raising performance in the final moments of the film, which does leave you feeling that he deserved more than just a measly Academy Awards nomination. In most artistic films I have seen, very close attention is paid to the subtleties and Magnolia follows this trend. The music, though soft in the background, blends effortlessly with the situation. It escalates tension, portrays desolateness and flows like a river over pebbles. Many of the scenes are shot in pale lights and tinged with shades of dark blue and black which is significant of the prevalent morbidity present in the characters and in their existence. It creeps into you, indulging you even more into the movie. Magnolia can be termed more of a piece of art than an entertainer. The end is highly unusual, but that just reasserts how unusual things can happen in the world. Quite nonchalantly, the film shows how we're just dots in a massive grid and how everything we do causes changes beyond measure.

So he got someone who shared in his artistic style, Henry Selick and together they made one of the best animated films of all time.Nightmare Before Christmas takes place in three worlds. Halloweentown, Christmastown and our world. The story is about a skeleton brilliantly named Jack Skellington who is tired of always scaring people and wants more out of his life(or lack there-of). While walking in the woods he stumbles across a circle of trees with doors to other worlds. He enters the Christmas one and is immediately swept away by the bright and colorful atmosphere of Christmastown. He returns to Halloweentown and tells all the other citizens about it. They soon decide they should try Christmas for themselves. Only one person\/rag doll experiment thinks this is a bad idea, Sally who is smitten for Jack(and him unaware of it).The citizens try their best but all they can make are scary toys to give to the children. At one point Santa Claus himself is taken to the resident bogeyman, Oogie Boogie after Jack borrows his hat to complete his costume. As Santa Claus is about to be forced to play a deadly gambling game, Jack goes out into the real world to deliver the presents. Things go horribly wrong and soon the citizens of the real world call the military to shoot the impostor Santa Claus down. Merry Christmas right? This film is magnificent. It's perfect to watch on Halloween or Christmas or anytime of the year. The characters are each unique in their own way and the songs in the movie are all extremely catchy and wonderfully orchestrated by Danny Elfman. Personally I can't think of any flaw in this film. Even with the relatively short run-time of 76 minutes the pacing is still pretty good and nothing really seems to drag on. This is just one of those movies you could watch forever and never tire of.

Now, Titanic has become the quintessential cool-to-hate film, hence one of the most controversial Best Picture winners, which is surprising because if anything, the movie screams 'Best Picture'. There's something quite unique in the way the huge success of Titanic became a defining key of detestation, challenging any attempt for a rational appreciation. Well, we're in 2011 now  the hype has passed, CGI became a tiresome trend providing a series of unoriginal special-effects-driven films, Kate won an Oscar and Scorsese injected some cinematic botox on Leo's ex-pretty-boy face. In these circumstances, I believe we have enough distance to judge Titanic again, regardless of all the peripheral elements that contributed to its success, back then, in 1997 &#x85;When Titanic was released, I was the kind of teenager who avoided any mainstream phenomenon, needless to say that I categorically refused to be brainwashed by the Titanic wave. The film was the absolute must-see and the girls were all drooling over Di Caprio, and you couldn't listen to the radio or watch TV musical programs without having the annoying flute of Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On. I was far from imagining that this music would define my personal nostalgia of the late 90's. Then the movie grabbed 11 Oscars, it was the most watched and re-watched film ever and I even had to make an essay about Titanic at school, where I eagerly expressed that the 'Iceberg story left me cold'But suddenly something strange happened. The bubble of popularity popped, some little fellows displayed a childish pride of having disliked the film. And I can't count how many girls were so pleased to say that Leo was too girlish, when one year before, he had an 'angel face'. Then I reversed my position, and from the enthusiasm of having avoided the film, I wanted to understand why people were being so hypocritical with their own appreciation, and feel guilty as if they admired a naked Emperor, with all flash and no substance. This is how Titanic gradually became the 'cool-to-hate' film, because it's always cool to hate popular stuff, but it's so uncool to try to be cool so this was my personal encouragement to give it a chance in 1999, and to know where I stood for. I came, I saw and I liked it.I'm not even afraid to admit that I loved it, it had everything I was expecting, it was spectacular, thrilling, romantic, and didn't rely too much on special effects except for the terrific sinking part. Yes, the film flirts with cinematic clichés sometimes, the whole 'follow your heart' message is almost Disney-like, but this is the point of the film, it's the romance with the Titanic as a setting, not the Titanic's story featuring a romance. When we think of Titanic, we have less the image of the ship breaking in half in our minds, than Kate and Leo flying over the sunset, this is the defining image of the film and one of the most iconic of American Cinema. And this is the strength of the film.A few recent movies have managed to achieve a classic status so quickly, and so impacting the way Titanic did and this is certainly due to the constant symbiosis between the story and the special effects that provided the 'classic' vibe, and whether it was intentional or not, it sure succeeded. Titanic has the thrills, the romance, and an inspirational message, simple enough to appeal to all the sensitive hearts all over the world. And seriously, let's not get too cynical about the marketing campaign, and deny the artistic value of some of the most financially successful films. There's a time for Independent films and another one for spectacular blockbusters &#x85; as long as there is a good story, justifying the use of special effects, and the exhilarating sinking sequence.Titanic had the intelligence to have a sort of classic story that could appeal on a universal level. A love story undermined by a tragedy, it's sad and inspiring, a love story between a rich aristocratic woman and a third-class youthful and optimistic boy, it's universal, the whole tragedy of the Titanic has been touched by a cinematic grace that made it one of the greatest American classics, and I mean 'great' in the classic meaning of the world. And I better take an innocent story, even naive, rather than a spectacular but dull one, like Independence Day one year before or a thought-provoking but manipulative one, like Saving Private Ryan the year after. So, I loved Titanic, I felt for the characters, the part where one mother reads a story for her children while the ship sinks will haunt me forever, the music beautifully conveys the innate sadness of a rather passionate romance. The film revives the greatest tradition of the disaster genre with a perfectionism that finally paid-off, and I applaud James Cameron for that. And now, I wonder what the haters hate in the film, what makes Lord of the Rings so deeper than Titanic, love story, good vs. evil? Don't they miss the young Leo who could smile and shout even the cringe-worthy king of the world line? Regarding the actual cinematic trends, Titanic is a classic among the classics and the deserving Best Picture of 1997.So, I don't find any particular reason to hate this film, and if I ever found one, let's say &#x85; uh, the part with the necklace which I didn't really care for, well, for one reason to dislike the film, I can find ten to love it. Disliking Titanic just because it was once so popular is simply a titanic mistake&#x85; ","genre":null},{"date":"23 October 2011","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Titanic was the cinematic phenomenon of the 90's and the worldwide highest grossing film of all time before being dethroned by Avatar, from James Cameron (the only director who could ever beat James Cameron in the box-office).

Then I reversed my position, and from the enthusiasm of having avoided the film, I wanted to understand why people were being so hypocritical with their own appreciation, and feel guilty as if they admired a naked Emperor, with all flash and no substance. This is how Titanic gradually became the 'cool-to-hate' film, because it's always cool to hate popular stuff, but it's so uncool to try to be cool so this was my personal encouragement to give it a chance in 1999, and to know where I stood for. I came, I saw and I liked it.I'm not even afraid to admit that I loved it, it had everything I was expecting, it was spectacular, thrilling, romantic, and didn't rely too much on special effects except for the terrific sinking part. Yes, the film flirts with cinematic clichés sometimes, the whole 'follow your heart' message is almost Disney-like, but this is the point of the film, it's the romance with the Titanic as a setting, not the Titanic's story featuring a romance. When we think of Titanic, we have less the image of the ship breaking in half in our minds, than Kate and Leo flying over the sunset, this is the defining image of the film and one of the most iconic of American Cinema. And this is the strength of the film.A few recent movies have managed to achieve a classic status so quickly, and so impacting the way Titanic did and this is certainly due to the constant symbiosis between the story and the special effects that provided the 'classic' vibe, and whether it was intentional or not, it sure succeeded. Titanic has the thrills, the romance, and an inspirational message, simple enough to appeal to all the sensitive hearts all over the world. And seriously, let's not get too cynical about the marketing campaign, and deny the artistic value of some of the most financially successful films. There's a time for Independent films and another one for spectacular blockbusters &#x85; as long as there is a good story, justifying the use of special effects, and the exhilarating sinking sequence.Titanic had the intelligence to have a sort of classic story that could appeal on a universal level. A love story undermined by a tragedy, it's sad and inspiring, a love story between a rich aristocratic woman and a third-class youthful and optimistic boy, it's universal, the whole tragedy of the Titanic has been touched by a cinematic grace that made it one of the greatest American classics, and I mean 'great' in the classic meaning of the world. And I better take an innocent story, even naive, rather than a spectacular but dull one, like Independence Day one year before or a thought-provoking but manipulative one, like Saving Private Ryan the year after. So, I loved Titanic, I felt for the characters, the part where one mother reads a story for her children while the ship sinks will haunt me forever, the music beautifully conveys the innate sadness of a rather passionate romance. The film revives the greatest tradition of the disaster genre with a perfectionism that finally paid-off, and I applaud James Cameron for that. And now, I wonder what the haters hate in the film, what makes Lord of the Rings so deeper than Titanic, love story, good vs. evil? Don't they miss the young Leo who could smile and shout even the cringe-worthy king of the world line? Regarding the actual cinematic trends, Titanic is a classic among the classics and the deserving Best Picture of 1997.So, I don't find any particular reason to hate this film, and if I ever found one, let's say &#x85; uh, the part with the necklace which I didn't really care for, well, for one reason to dislike the film, I can find ten to love it.

Now, Titanic has become the quintessential cool-to-hate film, hence one of the most controversial Best Picture winners, which is surprising because if anything, the movie screams 'Best Picture'. There's something quite unique in the way the huge success of Titanic became a defining key of detestation, challenging any attempt for a rational appreciation. Well, we're in 2011 now  the hype has passed, CGI became a tiresome trend providing a series of unoriginal special-effects-driven films, Kate won an Oscar and Scorsese injected some cinematic botox on Leo's ex-pretty-boy face. In these circumstances, I believe we have enough distance to judge Titanic again, regardless of all the peripheral elements that contributed to its success, back then, in 1997 &#x85;When Titanic was released, I was the kind of teenager who avoided any mainstream phenomenon, needless to say that I categorically refused to be brainwashed by the Titanic wave. The film was the absolute must-see and the girls were all drooling over Di Caprio, and you couldn't listen to the radio or watch TV musical programs without having the annoying flute of Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On. I was far from imagining that this music would define my personal nostalgia of the late 90's. Then the movie grabbed 11 Oscars, it was the most watched and re-watched film ever and I even had to make an essay about Titanic at school, where I eagerly expressed that the 'Iceberg story left me cold'But suddenly something strange happened. The bubble of popularity popped, some little fellows displayed a childish pride of having disliked the film.

When unintended consequences become the order of the day rather than the neat little plan we had in mind when first starting out. The Man Who Wasn't There takes that theme and relentlessly pursues it from beginning to end. Through it all, Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) rides that wave, seemingly detached but mercilessly buffeted by a series of events he set in motion with his very first thought that maybe dry cleaning is an idea whose time has come.Thornton and the camera perfectly complement each other under the direction of the Coen Brothers and cinematographer Roger Deakins. The picture evokes the best of the genre it attempts to emulate, classic film noir, but it goes beyond that definition with scenes and dialog that are downright hilarious at times. As in the courtroom scene with Freddy Riedenschneider (Tony Shalhoub) asking the jury to look not at the facts, but the meaning of the facts, even though the facts have no meaning. It's the uncertainty principle at work, where looking at something changes it, calling to mind a former President's request that we must consider what the definition if 'is' is. Personally, my favorite little gem was Ed Crane's summary description of Tolliver's (Jon Polito) disappearance - 'vaporized like the Nips at Nagasaki. Who came up with that line? Then there's the UFO conspiracy sub-text thrown in by Ann Nirdlinger Brewster (Katherine Borowitz) in that disturbing scene at Ed's door after Big Dave (James Gandolfini) died. Wasn't that just perfectly creepy? I have to admit, I dig this quirky stuff, and I don't know if there's anyone better at it than the Coen's. There's Barton Fink, Fargo and The Big Lebowski, but in those films, the parody was more overt and grabs you at gut level. Here you have to work at finding it a bit more, but the search is well worth it. The Coens go to a well established talent pool to cast their characters with the likes of Frances McDormand, Jon Polito and Tony Shalhoub, all repeat Coen performers here who fit their personas like a glove.Look, I know this is not the type of film to appeal to everyone, but to those of us it does, it's a blast. It's that uncertainty principle at work upon first viewing that amuses and entertains, with repeat viewings revealing further nuance that make the enjoyment even greater. As a fan of the Coen's, I could go for this stuff all day.
