Both are independent, but this actually has some scary scenes, whereas the first just had three stupid teenagers running around in the woods, getting drunk and high, and finally disappearing. This is far better. The film is about a few people who go into the same woods that the stupid teens went into in the first film; something very strange and apparently unexplainable happens, and they spend the rest of the film trying to figure out what exactly happened. The plot is very good, it starts out reminding the audience a lot of the first, and then drastically changing style, turning into a mystery-horror piece. The plot immediately takes off, I was pretty much completely into the film from the very first scene, whereas the first almost had me falling asleep during the first couple of scenes. It also has a great pace, while there constantly is something interesting or exciting going on, to keep you watching, without it getting cheesy, like many new Hollywood-like horror films tend to do. The acting is far better than the first film, at least for most of the characters. The main characters all seemed perfectly credible to me, which is far more than what I can say about the cast of the first film. Some of the supporting cast did seem a little lacking in acting ability, but these aren't actual actors, after all. The special effects and various shock effects are surprisingly good; I would be lying if I said I didn't jump in my seat at least three or four times. Now, as for the negative in the film; admittedly, the execution isn't as good as the idea itself, which is a bit unfortunate, because this plot really has potential, or, rather, had. Definitely more potential than the film utilizes, unfortunately. I can't complain about any of the scary scenes or special effects, they were all handled extremely well; even things that, had they been done just in a slightly different manner, would have looked ridiculous, and made the viewer laugh out loud rather than send chills down his spine. This film is about as far away from the original as it could possibly get, without actually using a completely different story. All in all, a very well-made horror film, that far surpasses the mess that was the first Blair Witch film. I recommend it to anyone who saw the first and was sorely disappointed by it, and any fans of horror in general, as it will please most generic horror fans with it's reasonably vast amount of blood and gore, and the amount of shocks and jumpy moments. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 July 2004","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I don't understand why so many people are rating this film so low, while there are so many people who are voting so high for the first film; this is clearly a far superior film.

Like the Coen Brothers, it's hard to make his films accessible to the public like many other films at the cineplexes, and that's part of the joy in watching a film such as Ghost Dog. It's such a strange kind of story, but it's a story that extremely well crafted, even when some of the characters aren't developed enough past a certain point. While I can't really say that it's a great film, there are plenty of great things about it.Such as a pulsing, rhythmically engaging soundtrack (I'm not a big fan of rap and hip-hop, but the artists on here are better than expected) with the RZA behind the seat. Delicate, finite cinematography by Robby Mueller (who's other superb collaboration with Jarmusch was on Down By Law). A performance from Forrest Whitaker, as the dedicated, un-hinged-from reality 'samurai' known as Ghost Dog, which ranks among his best and shows in plain sight that he can carry an action film with patience and cool. And the film also carries a fine sense of humor to many scenes - the fact that these gangsters (one of which Dog's boss) watch more cartoons than take care of business is as funny as the way they interact sometimes. While it tends to streak on parody, in the characters there's still the fascinating Jarmusch has in mixing the cultures. It's a hard film to classify, for even though it's a martial-arts movie, the only sight of a sword is used for practice and not a blood-bath in Kill Bill. It's a gangster movie, but every five minutes or so there's philosophical notes on the way of the samurai that seems more in place in a (good, thematically engaging) art film than a (good, shoot-em-up) Hollywood actioner. It's a movie about urban-life, yet the only signs of Urbana are shown from a distance, where the only two who will talk to Ghost Dog are a Haitian ice cream guy (who provides a wonderfully weird scene on the roof with Ghost Dog), and a little girl who likes to read. But it's this mixture that can keep a viewer on his or her toes, especially once you realize the psychological state of the lead as much as his spiritual state.Parts of the film might turn off one group, but the other parts of the film might keep the same group enthralled. In fact, it's as interesting a comparison to be made to Kill Bill (itself a hybrid) as it is in the spiritual and stylistic parent, Le Samourai by Melville. Like those films, at the least, Jarmusch's film asks to be looked at more than once...Anyway, three cheers for Garry Nobody Farmer!

I also enjoyed the score which brilliantly complemented the action taking place. Even though the film focussed on four people, it managed to flick between stories without being confusing, and in the same time showing the links between the four people.As for the acting, it was simply excellent, especially by Ellen Burstyn (who was nominated for an Oscar for this role).

It's that big guy with the impressive jaw who people kept trying to stab in the back on the neck on the X-Files...and he's in quasi Mad-Max football apocalypse gear. And he's a kung fu demon..or something. I was never really sure what the gist of the villains in mortal kombat was.But wait, there's more. Kung fu villain can destroy the world in like a week unless a handful of poor actors engage him in....a rousing game of Kerplunk. It's a sad fact this couldn't have made the movie worse and it could be argued that the action would have been better. But I digress.No, it's mortal kombat these sad sacks must engage in. The K means it's serious, none of that sissy C combat us losers engage in with the mailman, no sir.Who sets up the rules for such a competition, we can only guess. Personally, I don't see the logic in let's fight to the death or you all die but hey, I'm not a sugar addict video game designer who needs to be able to fit the plot of his game on the back of a business card.Who steps up to face the villainous X-Files clone?

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"9 July 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  It's really ironic that Rosemary's Baby is so often cited as one of the greatest horror films ever made. Because, when you watch it, it doesn't really share much with what many consider horror films. There is not one menacing villain versus several main characters, of which those with faults succumb to grisly deaths, while those with virtues survive to the end. In fact, there is hardly any violence, or even scenes of immediate tension, such as those when a victim hides out in some dark area, isolated from the rest of humanity, with no weapon, while a violent, supernatural murderer haunts (usually her) the victim. The horror in this type of horror film is of course short-lived and short-lasting. Thus, a modern horror film generally comprises several such scenes where the tension is permitted to artificially rise and then is released when the violence occurs. I say artificial because the formula is so known to the audience that the audience members can practically predict where the tension will rise, though they may still experience it. The tension in modern horror is formulaic and often constructed out of absurd situations.Rosemary's Baby, Polanski's first American film, is different. It is the story of one, fragile individual who, at her most vulnerable (during her pregnancy), descends into psychological hell. The tension here is absolutely real, even though the premise is absurd. (The premise, by the way, is that Rosemary's husband agrees to let his wife be host to the son of Satan in exchange for a successful career). However, the realism of the general premise is absolutely unnecessary for the film to work, precisely because it is psychological.Rosemary's Baby begins like a bad romance film. A couple buys an apartment, chats with the neighbors and talks of making a baby. Then, Rosemary, in a nightmarish vision gets impregnated and things start to go wrong. She has dreams though she feels they are real. Her neighbors persuade her to switch to another doctor, one who ignores her complaints about the pain she feels. She finds mysterious scratches on her arms. A friend who had something important to tell her ends up dead. She hears voices and slowly, but surely, the coincidences start to add up in her head. They form a *believable* reality - and the reason it is believable is because we follow Rosemary's logic and fears. We can't help but draw the same, terrifying conclusions.Thus, Rosemary's Baby terrifies precisely because it makes an absurdly-horrific situation believable and genuinely upsetting. A lot of factors, of course, aside from the story make this work. No doubt, Polanski's expert direction helps visually and psychologically construct a claustrophobic, alienating and alien world. John Cassevetes is great as Rosemary's husband, Guy, who's masculine innocence carries dark undertones. And Mia Farrow, or Rosemary, is the perfect victim for this little scheme - innocent, naive, steadily growing more exhausted, more paranoid, Farrow plays Rosemary perfectly. And, without Rosemary's believable psychological reaction to the events unfolding around her, the film would lose half its strength.In Rosemary's Baby Polanski explores some of the themes that would preoccupy him for the rest of his directorial career. The idea of alienation, de-humanization and schizophrenia (the ultimate psychological fracture and collapse) in the face of a gradual advent of evil is the central theme in the story. Rosemary's environment, for reasons unknown to her, becomes inimical and harmful and she is helpless in the face of it. And it happens so gradually and subtly, it's easy to forget that everything used to be peaceful in the beginning.Upon a third viewing (I believe) Polanski's direction still appears expert. However, I realized that Rosemary's Baby is simply extremely well-made pulp. It's at the top of the pulpy scale and it almost approaches art, but not quite - Chinatown, however, does. Rosemary's Baby is a film about paranoia and perhaps feminism, but it doesn't come close to the existential horror of Chinatown.And it isn't Polanski's most terrifying pulpy horror. I do put it above Repulsion of which I was never a fan, but Rosemary's Baby pales in comparison to a much darker, later film, The Tenant. The Tenant stars Polanski himself and is a story not unlike the story of Rosemary. A man rents an apartment in Paris and things around him go very wrong - the apartment, Paris and humanity turn against him. He is a victim of circumstance, coincidence, much like Rosemary, but the ambiguity of The Tenant leaves far more terrifying implications. It leaves the viewer wondering whether the tenant is actually sane and whether what he witnesses is real or only a schizophrenic hallucination. Rosemary's Baby has similarly ambiguous elements, but I think the question of Rosemary's sanity isn't as central to the film as the change of her physical and psychological reality. But in The Tenant you never really do know. Whether the tenant is sane. Whether you're sane and what sanity is anyway. It's all stripped to terrifying darkness, in which you can't see anything. And that darkness, losing one's mind, is far more terrifying, and realistic, than giving birth to Satan's child.

Too many great bands are wasted in promotion of this film, and that is travesty number 2 (Nine Inch Nails, Medicine, Ministry, Skinny Puppy, This Mortal Coil, The Smiths, Curve, Love & Rockets, Cocteau Twins, Wolfgang Press, Meat Beat Manifesto, Jesus & Mary Chain, MC 900 Ft.

Jesus, Lush, Babyland . . . and many more). The third travesty is that it is bound to be compared against the visionaries in the field of film actually making great film, as mentioned earlier. This includes people admitting they get it, whether they call it camp, farce, dark, underground, alternative, shock, experimental, exploitation, avante-garde, film-noir, anti-hero, gothic, et. al. That is the real joke being played on those who try to convince everyone else it is redeemable by using these film styles to say the film doesn't suck. But suck nonetheless it does. You can't avoid that fact unless you are without personality. I like all of the above mentioned styles of film and more, but this film is SERIOUSLY lacking in the direction, script, storyline, acting, dialogue, and other major factors, all which would make a good film. You cannot be at a loss of so many important film characteristics and have a good film. Thus, although it has been said before, this is truly an exercise of style over substance, apparently in the desperation to do the above mentioned con of the public into thinking it is great, or just selling soundtrack albums. If you want style AND substance in the vein this movie tries to be in, may I recommend the following films The Crow, Natural Born Killers, Lost Highway, The Addams Family, Beetlejuice. This film is sadly, like none of these and is most like the film Baise-Moi in its substance. So if you nonetheless like this film you will probably like that one. So all in all, if you have to watch this movie I would conclude it is best with the sound turned off (no kidding) and your favorite period music from any of the above bands or soundtrack movies that I mentioned as good. And as mentioned before, it is nice to see Rose McGowan naked again and again, and not mentioned before, the other scene that is worth watching is the brief yo-yo scene. If you watch it, you'll know what I mean. The only thing really shocking about the film is how bad (readawful) it is and such a waste of talent and resources involved.

That's the famous trademark to the Friday the 13th series. This is probably one of my favorite 80's slashers, and none of the sequels it spawned (which is about 10 currently) are nearly as good. Friday the 13th is about a group of camp counselors who are left alone overnight to fix up the camp before its grand reopening. The teens are having fun and enjoying themselves, swimming, playing games, having sex, and just having a good time. But their good time comes to an end when a big storm hits that evening, and suddenly the teens begin to gruesomely die left and right. Who is killing off the teens at Camp Crystal Lake? Could it be Jason Voorhees, who drowned in the lake years ago? Or perhaps someone else? I wont say who the killer is, because it will ruin the whole movie if you haven't seen it, so I'll stop there.Friday the 13th wouldn't appear to be a movie deserving of all the popularity that it received. Its overall storyline seems typical of its genre, with a bunch of worthless teenagers at the hands of a merciless killer. But this film is remembered as such a classic because it set off the domino-effect of the countless slasher movies that evolved from the '80s, many of them essential rip-offs. While the slasher-type story of Friday the 13th isn't unique, the twist in the end really sets it apart. The atmosphere is spooky, and the summer camp setting is perfect, plus that unforgettably eerie score adds to the film's energy. Also notable are the clever and disturbing ways that the characters are killed off, many of which have never been forgotten by genre fans. Acting-wise, it isn't amazing in the least, and the majority of our performers are mediocre at best. Adrienne King leads the cast competently, and you'll recognize a young Kevin Bacon as a camp counselor, along with Betsy Palmer as a prime example of a delusional psychopath.In my opinion this is the best movie of the series by far, the rest are just a bunch of rather cheap slasher films that were spawned consecutively after the success of the original, although they are still somewhat enjoyable on a corny-slasher flick kind of level. This movie has spawned ten sequels already if that tells you anything, but the first is still number one and I think it always will be. How can you get any better than this movie? This is the ultimate slasher movie in my opinion, and I'm having trouble deciding whether or not I like this better than Halloween. I suppose this film is taken a little less seriously, but I think that makes it an even more fun film to watch. There are creative murders, a great setting, and one hell of an ending.Overall, Friday the 13th is the perfect movie to watch on a stormy summer night, because you are guaranteed to have a good time. It set the grounds for the uncountable number of slasher films that followed during the decade, and remains a prime example of what a good slasher movie is. This is one of those movies that I can watch over and over again and never really get tired of it. Sure, Friday the 13th may be a body count movie - but it's really the king of them all.

Dirty and raunchy don't necessarily have to translate into dull and unfunny. Hell, even Mel Brooks was popular for doing plenty of low-brow humor, but he knows how to deliver the crudeness in a hilarious way. Director Jeff Pollack obviously doesn't possess Brooks' magic. I'm not going to lie. There are some gags that still make me laugh, but they are few and far between. For example, there's a great cameo from the always-funny Bernie Mac. And though it's a clichéd gag, I did enjoy the two Middle Eastern convenience store clerks. Keeping on the theme of ethnic stereotypes, I also liked the scene with Gedde Watanabe (of Sixteen Candles fame) as a Chinese waiter, who utters a very funny line in ebonics.But most of the gags are downright pathetic. Even comedy must involve a certain degree of truth, and it's hard to buy into--much less laugh at--a bunch of scenarios that make virtually no sense. In one scene, the four characters are playing cards. Jamie Foxx goes under the table to pick up a card, and the dog licks Vivica A. Fox's toes. She assumes that it's Jamie licking her. Then the dog licks Jamie's rear end, and he assumes that Vivica is licking it. Can you get a more ridiculous scenario? Not to mention the gag is poorly executed. As Jay Leno always says, This comedy thing's not so easy, is it? No, it is not, Jay. As is shown in amateurish comedies like this. Unfortunately, 99 percent of people in this world think they can do comedy, and about 10 percent of those people are right. On a non-cynical note, Jamie Foxx is a moderately talented comedian\/actor. Unfortunately, his performance in this movie is all over the map. Like Albert Brooks said, when you do a movie you have to be funny as a person, not funny as a comedian. Foxx constantly spits out sly one-liners, like only a comedian can. He tries so hard to be funny that he rarely is. When I see him as Bunz in this movie, he reminds me of one of those obnoxious friends, who you constantly want to tell to shut the f**k up and\/or punch in the face. It's no mystery that comedy is best when played straight, but obviously Foxx didn't solve that mystery prior to doing this movie. One person who hasn't solved that mystery 'til this day is Tommy Davidson. Outside of In Living Color, I don't think I've ever found him funny. He plays the straight man this time around, but hints of his goofy style of comedy show up here and there. I haven't met one person yet, who thinks he's a comic genius. I saw his pathetic stand-up act on an episode of The Tonight Show. Is there anything he knows how to do other than mug and make annoying voices? The third act of the film mostly centers on an utterly disgusting gag involving Davidson accidentally on his way to get castrated. First of all, if you're a guy, just hearing the word castration brings feelings of pain (women will NEVER understand!). Second of all, the gag might've worked if it were executed in a more discreet, tasteful way. There's a similar gag in the movie Sour Grapes, but it's executed in a much less disgusting and much funnier way. Then again, that movie was directed by the co-creator of Seinfeld and Booty Call is made by amateurs. If you're easily pleased by gags of any sexual nature, this should be your cup of tea.

Unfortunately, now that I'm a young adult, I don't find the film as funny as I did when I saw it in grade school. When you're in grade school, you'll laugh at anything with a penis reference. Dirty and raunchy don't necessarily have to translate into dull and unfunny. Hell, even Mel Brooks was popular for doing plenty of low-brow humor, but he knows how to deliver the crudeness in a hilarious way. Director Jeff Pollack obviously doesn't possess Brooks' magic. I'm not going to lie. There are some gags that still make me laugh, but they are few and far between. For example, there's a great cameo from the always-funny Bernie Mac. And though it's a clichéd gag, I did enjoy the two Middle Eastern convenience store clerks. Keeping on the theme of ethnic stereotypes, I also liked the scene with Gedde Watanabe (of Sixteen Candles fame) as a Chinese waiter, who utters a very funny line in ebonics.But most of the gags are downright pathetic. Even comedy must involve a certain degree of truth, and it's hard to buy into--much less laugh at--a bunch of scenarios that make virtually no sense. In one scene, the four characters are playing cards. Jamie Foxx goes under the table to pick up a card, and the dog licks Vivica A. Fox's toes. She assumes that it's Jamie licking her. Then the dog licks Jamie's rear end, and he assumes that Vivica is licking it. Can you get a more ridiculous scenario? Not to mention the gag is poorly executed. As Jay Leno always says, This comedy thing's not so easy, is it? No, it is not, Jay. As is shown in amateurish comedies like this. Unfortunately, 99 percent of people in this world think they can do comedy, and about 10 percent of those people are right. On a non-cynical note, Jamie Foxx is a moderately talented comedian\/actor. Unfortunately, his performance in this movie is all over the map. Like Albert Brooks said, when you do a movie you have to be funny as a person, not funny as a comedian. Foxx constantly spits out sly one-liners, like only a comedian can. He tries so hard to be funny that he rarely is. When I see him as Bunz in this movie, he reminds me of one of those obnoxious friends, who you constantly want to tell to shut the f**k up and\/or punch in the face. It's no mystery that comedy is best when played straight, but obviously Foxx didn't solve that mystery prior to doing this movie. One person who hasn't solved that mystery 'til this day is Tommy Davidson. Outside of In Living Color, I don't think I've ever found him funny. He plays the straight man this time around, but hints of his goofy style of comedy show up here and there. I haven't met one person yet, who thinks he's a comic genius. I saw his pathetic stand-up act on an episode of The Tonight Show. Is there anything he knows how to do other than mug and make annoying voices? The third act of the film mostly centers on an utterly disgusting gag involving Davidson accidentally on his way to get castrated. First of all, if you're a guy, just hearing the word castration brings feelings of pain (women will NEVER understand!). Second of all, the gag might've worked if it were executed in a more discreet, tasteful way. There's a similar gag in the movie Sour Grapes, but it's executed in a much less disgusting and much funnier way. Then again, that movie was directed by the co-creator of Seinfeld and Booty Call is made by amateurs. If you're easily pleased by gags of any sexual nature, this should be your cup of tea. Others beware.

They don't even tell Bogart their right names, let alone what they're after. But Bogart figures it all out. He does so by keeping his mouth shut, trusting no one, telling nothing but the truth but very little of that, listening and observing. Bogart is to Michael Douglas as matter is to anti-matter. Douglas has got to be one of the dumbest cops ever put on film outside of a deliberate comedy. He believes everything that everyone tells him, no matter how suspicious or self contradictory the characters may be, and what he learns, he blabs to anybody who will listen. He runs into clues and ignores them. Paul Verhoeven is a pretty well-known action director, or that's the impression I get. Here, he seems to have no more idea where the movie is going than Michael Douglas has. Everybody is at sea, including the viewer. The plot's too confusing to bother with. Not that confusion per se is bad, just that here the confusion is unaccompanied by any kind of style. There is a bloody murder. Two and a half car chases, one and a half of them completely pointless except to zap up the pace of the film. A confusion of identities. Stupid moves on the part of everyone. Beautiful San Francisco locations. A score that sometimes sounds like Bernard Hermann, which is okay. Here's a really hoary device -- Douglas is tearing through some mailboxes in an empty foyer while the music begins to pound, then a hand reaches in from out of the frame and grabs his shoulder, and the score emits a shriek. I thought that one had been put to bed by 1954.Douglas is okay as the confused detective. Dzundza is okay as his sidekick although we know immediately he's not going to last for the whole movie. The other characters kind of blend into one another except for Sharon Stone who demonstrates that she has a nice figure. It doesn't quite make up for her acting. She's as bad here as she was later to be good, in Casino. One constant in her movie career is that when you see Sharon Stone coming, you know there will be trouble, only you can't be sure whether it will be slow and painful like prostate cancer or quick and thorough like cardiac arrest. Well, you do get sex in this movie. Nudity, including Douglas's buns if that's of any interest, and quite a bit of Sharone Stone. The simulated sex doesn't resemble sex as civilized people know it. Unless maybe I haven't been hanging around with civilized people lately. There isn't any particular REASON for the roughness. There are some ice pick murders and suggestions of bondage but that doesn't account for the feral quality of, say, Douglas's lovemaking techniques. Stone is a thorough fruitcake, true, but Douglas is supposed to be relatively normal, and so is Jeanne Tripplehorn as the shrink. I don't get it. Maybe there's nothing to get. Simulated sex has become so common on screen that if you want your sex scenes to stand out from the pack you need to introduce something new -- violence or something. Next time Verhoeven might try introducing an animal of some sort into the proceedings, a mule or something. I mean, where does it stop? How far is a director willing to go to draw in an audience?This movie is worth seeing if only as a curiosity. And it does have nice locations in Monterey and Marin Counties.

I've always enjoyed The Empire Strikes Back the most of all three, and Return of the Jedi the least. It is arguably one of the earliest signs of things to come for writer George Lucas, who employs a band of child-friendly (and marketable) Eewoks to join Luke Skywalker on his quest against the Empire in this installment.

The Eewoks aren't very far off from Jar-Jar Binks.That's not to say Return of the Jedi is a bad film -- in fact it's very good. But we all remember, May the force be with you from Star Wars, and I am your father! from The Empire Strikes Back. There's nothing particularly memorable here -- it is not one of the greatest films ever made, just a very satisfying (if occasionally goofy) conclusion to the trilogy. It is not as bad as The Matrix Revolutions, for sure.Han Solo (Harrison Ford), now cryogenically frozen by Jabba the Hutt, is being held captive. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) both try to rescue Han, to no avail, and Luke -- now a Jedi -- ends up being thrown into the pit of a dangerous beast, which he defeats to the surprise of Jabba. Jabba then decides to have all of them murdered, but Luke and co. make a daring escape with the help of all his pals -- C-3PO, R2-D2, Leia and Chewbacca -- and eventually end up on a faraway planet where they arrive under the car of the friendly Eewoks, who help them with their attack against The Empire's new and improved Death Star. Luke uncovers a startling secret about Leia, revisits the dying Yoda, and eventually comes face-to-face with Vader, where he is faced with a bit of a moral dilemma after the Emperor decides that Luke would be a worthy addition to their army.It's pointless divulging into the plot in-depth basically because everyone has already seen these movies. What can be discussed are the special effects, performances, and general plot of the film, as that is what most people will take from this film -- those looking for meaningful dialogue should look elsewhere. Released in 1983, six years after the original, special effects had evolved even more -- with a larger budget to expand upon director Richard Marquand tops off both prior films in terms of SF\/X. There's an exciting chase sequence, lots of hyper-speed battles, space ship exteriors and lightsaber fights -- enough to wet the appetite of anyone looking for mere action.Unfortunately what Return of the Jedi lacks is originality -- Star Wars was unique when it came out, recycling old storytelling clichés in a modern update; the sequel was very dark and impressive with arguably the best performances of all three films; the only thing to look for here is Luke's sudden evolution from Jedi trainee to Jedi master. Oh, and the final showdown, which is still impressive, even by today's efforts.All in all, Return of the Jedi is not on the same level as its predecessors but it is an exciting movie that manages to satisfyingly end the series on a high note.

Not much can top Psycho and I'm not sure if there is anything that could be done to improve it.  It is just that good.10 out of 10.

Hitchcock does a great job of telling a story with a film, not necessarily pointing everything out to viewer, but keeping the viewer on their toes the whole time.  Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is the heroine of the story who steals $40,000 of her boss's money and flees the city.  Twists and turns abound as Marion is followed by a police officer for much of her trip neither her nor us knowing what he knows or why he finds her suspicious.Eventually Marion meets up with Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who runs a run-down hotel much like any you could find along any highway anywhere in the country.  What follows is one of the most famous scenes and events in motion picture history.

Looking old and burnt out, he plods his way through a plot that is really much too serious for an action movie.  He has no hilarious one-liners and he kicks only a modicum of a**, which is a big mistake since that's what we're paying to see.  The mighty have fallen to this...  I was impressed with Francesca Neri's performance, and unlike everybody else in the universe I think that Arnold is actually a pretty good actor.  But his material here is B-grade political thriller stuff that belongs in a Tom Clancy paperback packed with schematics of all the military vehicles involved.  Arnold works better in sci-fi and fantasy settings; his contemporary Earth movies are pretty boring, and I'm always amazed that none of the supporting characters ever comment on his physique or accent.  Why doesn't somebody, just once, say daaaaamn, that's a big Austrian guy?
