[{"date":"18 January 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is a con-man, who's finagled his way into the lives of Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), and Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow) who are living in Italy, by convincing Dickie's father (James Rebhorn), that he can persuade Dickie to come back to the States.Instead of convincing Dickie to return home, Tom befriends Dickie, and Marge, and begins living with them, on Dickie's Fathers Dime. As time passes, Dickie becomes less and less enamored with Tom, and the two have an argument, which ends with Tom killing Dickie, on a boat, in the middle of the ocean. Tom covers his tracks as best as he can, and begins posing as Dickie, using his passport, clothes, and financial means to better himself. Dickie's long time friend, Freddie Miles (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who Tom had met while Dickie was still alive, begins to poke around into Dickie's disappearance, but things get too hot for Tom, and he also kills Freddie.Tom pens a suicide note, after studying Dickie's handwriting for sometime, and addresses it to himself, leaving it in Dickie's apartment, which the police later find, and read. No one is convinced that Dickie killed himself, and his Father even goes so far as to hire a private detective to investigate the matters, but he clears Tom later.During Dickie's 'disappearance,' Peter Smith-Kingsley (Jack Davenport), Dickie and Marge's friend comes to stay with Marge while this is going on. He's eventually introduced to Tom, and the two hit it off, becoming fast friends, as no one suspects Tom. Eventually, Tom and Peter leave together (this is a few weeks later, after no culprit for Freddie and Dickie's murder has been found), on a boat, where he later kills Peter.I found this film quite engrossing. It was a bit lengthy, with a 2 Hour- 19 Minute runtime, but it was quite enjoyable, overall. Dark, comedic, and dramatic, everything I look for in a film. Matt Damon really showed me range in this film, which is already nearly 15 years old. 7.7\/10 (7.3\/10 on IMDb) ","genre":null},{"date":"18 January 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is a con-man, who's finagled his way into the lives of Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), and Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow) who are living in Italy, by convincing Dickie's father (James Rebhorn), that he can persuade Dickie to come back to the States.Instead of convincing Dickie to return home, Tom befriends Dickie, and Marge, and begins living with them, on Dickie's Fathers Dime.
