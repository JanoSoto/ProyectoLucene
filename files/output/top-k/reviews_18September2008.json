An absolute modern-day classic. Why?

It's not a bad film, nor is it even remotely a great film- the only two sorts of films that the hit (Nashville) and miss (Vincent And Theo) Altman has plenty of experience with. The nine stories and one poem of Carver's, from the same titled anthology book, have been transplanted from the Pacific Northwest to Los Angeles, and many of the stories are made to cross over with each other, where they were unconnected in print, as well from different story collections, with several characters being based upon more than one character to help achieve that end. The problem is that the film loses focus when it centers on lesser written tales, which Altman does not make better, and on some tales which he actually makes worse. There are ten stories and two dozen characters that fill the screen, and a plenum of human melodrama, drama, and darkness fill the screen joy, sadness, jealousy, fear, reconciliation, pain, infidelity, and death- accidental, murder, and suicide are among them.The quick moving vignettes are so filigreed that to do justice to each would take far too long, but most work well, until it comes to their resolutions&#133;. Short Cuts is a film almost wholly devoted to the written word, as all great films are, but its 'little above average' goodness, rather than greatness, stems from the fact that the words of Carver- as hit and miss in prose as Altman is on film, are never allowed their full power nor poesy. Despite what others have said, Carver was no minimalist. Becekett was a minimalist. Carver was merely lean in his prose- which is not synonymous with minimalism, but he was rich in characterization and 'moment'- at his best. This film never quite finds that groove. It is like 85% of the way to an orgasm, but the result is that its wad is never shot, although its member ripens. This impotence comes not only from the screenplay's flaws, but from the anomic cinematography of Walt Lloyd- who will have no one comparing him to Sven Nykvist, and the off the rack musical scoring of Mark Isham.There is also much pointless nudity in the film- mostly female, which has led feminist critics to damn the film. Usually, their critiques are downright silly- and vapidly lead them to stick out their tongues and call Carver a 'misogynist', or worse. He's not, clearly, but as the nudity is pointless- such as a muff shot of Julianne Moore cleaning wine from her dress as she fesses up to her infidelity, why is it included? Is her orange pubic hair so greatly symbolic or ironic? No. Is it realism? Perhaps, but it is 'cheap realism'. Marketing is a more likely and truthful reply. Yet it is the 'real realism' of the film that is mother to its best moments, little moments like Paul Finnigan's egg trick, Claire Kane's pretending to sign the guest book at the funeral of the dead girl her husband had no compassion for, or the humorous photo mixup where Gordon sees the photos of a 'dead' Honey that Bill staged, and Honey and Lois see the photos of the dead girl in the river that Gordon also did not empathize with, which lead both parties to memorize the others' license plates in order to report them to the police. That the 'real reality' of this work of art is so few and far between, and leads to its diminution, one wonders what a good dollop of, say 'real fiction' may have added? A little more Carver and a little less 'tang may have been the best and shortest cut this film had to greatness.

This is a remake of the pretty dull 1960s Las Vegas heist movie of the same title starring Frank Sinatra and the rest of the Rat Pack. I've seen both films and I must say that this is one of those rare exceptions where the remake improves on the original. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is an ex-con newly released from prison who immediately jumps back into the shady life. He already has a larcenous scheme in mind and enlists his old right-hand man Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) to help him recruit a thieving crew. Oh and what a crew Matt Damon as the rookie, quick-fingered and well versed in pickpocketing; Bernie Mac as the inside man; Don Cheadle, the explosives expert, comes armed with a great Cockney accent and that weird Cockney way of rhyming (We're in Barney; Clooney makes a nonplussed gesture; Barney Rubble - Trouble!); old-school Carl Reiner plays the old con-man out for a last con; Casey Affleck is the nerdy computer\/surveillance technoman; etc. Ocean and company target the super-protected vault underneath the Bellagio casino. This vault stores money for three casinos the Bellagio itself, as well as the MGM Grand and the Mirage. Apparently, on weekend nights of big boxing events, the vault by law has to house at least $150 million to cover all bets. The man who owns the Bellagio is Terry Benedict (played with smooth, reptilian menace by Andy Garcia), who is also the current love of Ocean's ex Tess (a radiant Julia Roberts). Hmmm, you start to think. Ocean's motivations are not the only thing that'll keep the viewer guessing in this funny, fast-paced, twisty film. The director Steven Soderbergh skillfully plays fast and loose with flashbacks, dizzying, continuing pan shots and sleight-of-hand camera-work. There is plenty of false jeopardy played out in the course of this movie, numerous plot reversals. Don't take anything for granted until the end credits come up. Steven Soderbergh directs this remake with such a light touch that it seems as if all he's done is throw all these high-profiled mega-stars in the same room and direct them, with perhaps a nonchalant wave of a hand, to simply wing it. The performers deliver their lines convincingly and with panache. They are, after all, all damn good actors (check out the DVD actor commentary with Damon, Pitt and Garcia, who have a chuckle over the talented serious actor Don Cheadle, who delivers his lines while covered in poo). I had a sense that everyone involved genuinely liked each other and had a great time bouncing off each other in their scenes. Clooney and Pitt, in particular, seem to have great buddy rapport together, whilst romantically, Clooney and Roberts sizzle. Andy Garcia is a great villain, suave yet intense, worthy of going up against eleven crafty adversaries. Soderbergh does a masterful juggling act in this one ensuring that everyone in the film gets his\/her day to shine, managing to stage every scene so that every shot is interesting and keeping the topsy-turvy plot on point. Kudos, too, to the music, which works to great effect and greatly influences the mood of every stage of the film (I thought actually purchased the soundtrack). Great job by everyone involved.

Hmmm, you start to think. Ocean's motivations are not the only thing that'll keep the viewer guessing in this funny, fast-paced, twisty film. The director Steven Soderbergh skillfully plays fast and loose with flashbacks, dizzying, continuing pan shots and sleight-of-hand camera-work. There is plenty of false jeopardy played out in the course of this movie, numerous plot reversals. Don't take anything for granted until the end credits come up. Steven Soderbergh directs this remake with such a light touch that it seems as if all he's done is throw all these high-profiled mega-stars in the same room and direct them, with perhaps a nonchalant wave of a hand, to simply wing it.

They are, after all, all damn good actors (check out the DVD actor commentary with Damon, Pitt and Garcia, who have a chuckle over the talented serious actor Don Cheadle, who delivers his lines while covered in poo). I had a sense that everyone involved genuinely liked each other and had a great time bouncing off each other in their scenes. Clooney and Pitt, in particular, seem to have great buddy rapport together, whilst romantically, Clooney and Roberts sizzle. Andy Garcia is a great villain, suave yet intense, worthy of going up against eleven crafty adversaries. Soderbergh does a masterful juggling act in this one ensuring that everyone in the film gets his\/her day to shine, managing to stage every scene so that every shot is interesting and keeping the topsy-turvy plot on point.

This is a remake of the pretty dull 1960s Las Vegas heist movie of the same title starring Frank Sinatra and the rest of the Rat Pack. I've seen both films and I must say that this is one of those rare exceptions where the remake improves on the original.

From the first time I saw Woody Allen's 88 minute long black and white 1980 film Stardust Memories (made early on in Woody's Golden Era of 1977-1992), on a VHS tape, I knew I was watching one of the greatest films ever made. In the years, and 12-15 rewatchings of the film (progressing to DVD), nothing has changed my mind in this regard. Not even the red herring of linking this film to Federico Fellini's 1964 opus 8½. Having just rewatched the film, I can state not only is it one of the greatest films ever made, but arguably Allen's greatest film (although fans of Another Woman and Crimes And Misdemeanors may have a case), and definitively better a film than Fellini's (which is only arguably a great film)- for its humor, concision, lack of pretension, and screenplay, which, truth be told, is not nearly as big an influence on this film as Allen's most dogged critics claim.The reason for the greatness of Stardust Memories can be summed up in one phrase fear of failure. That is what holds the outer film (and its reality into the world) together, although the fear of success is also an integral part of the film's inner world. Let me explain. The fear of failure is one of the most important things any artist, especially the great, can have. Why? Because it kills the ego, and spurs the artist to innovate and try new techniques to keep their art ahead of the curve. Without such a fear, artists grow fat and sassy, and lose the demiurge to create, or at least to challenge themselves and their audiences. Need proof? Just think of the vast majority of aging artists, but most especially those who were once great. How many aging musicians and rock groups have never been able to equal their greatest early hits? How many writers have penned bloated egotistical tomes that are pallid reflections of an earlier work? How many visual artists have bled dry the one nugget or &#150;ism they made their name on? And one need only look at the dozen or more films that Allen, himself, has made since his Golden Era ended- mostly lesser reworks of themes his greater films tackled better. Like many before him, Allen has settled into the Old Artist Syndrome, just coasting on his laurels (considerable though they may be).But, it is the fear of failure that gets into the great artist and makes him experiment and risk failure. Stardust Memories is one of the most experimental films of all times- in its screenplay, its visuals, its humor, its use of time and reality, as well as its ability to question the very notion of the artist and the self. Most great works of art are lucky to tackle a single one of these aspects in a new manner. Yet, while the fear of failure dominates the essence of the film in the real world, it is also the very core of the film within. The lead characters are all obsessed with failing. Some try to grow and are slapped down by the powers that be. Some give in to their own fears. Some are so timid they do nothing at all, and some try to change, only to make asses of themselves. And it is this fact, this inner examination of the fear of failure that provoked such a hostile reaction from almost all critics upon the film's release nearly three decades ago&#133;. Great art perdures whereas culture is a whimsical thing. Something lauded one year becomes déclassé the next, and vice versa. But the elements that constitute a great work of art remain- excellence of craft; a deeper revelation of reality- especially if of something the audience presumes to already know (in this case, Allen's own personae and politics); and a broad appeal to the intellectual as well as the emotional sides of a viewer. Too often, poor art strives to hit just one of those aspects. If it goes too intellectual it often becomes pompous, pretentious, and didactic. If it shoots merely for the emotional it becomes sappy, maudlin, and predictable. Stardust Memories succeeds on both counts, as one of the most intellectually challenging films ever made, yet also one of the most humorously entertaining, as it deals with the nonsense that all humans deal with, and slough off, and also as it asks deep questions, such as when Sandy Bates is approached by an old pal he played stickball with, and who is envious of him. Bates replies that their fortunes were largely determined by luck, which is a fearful thing, for it means the utter lack of control in life. Yet, Bates delivers this shiv of knowledge so thoughtfully and empathetically, that his old pal seems relieved, even happy, even though Bates and we, the audience, know that that character is doomed to an utterly meaningless existence. And it is just such moments, delivered so matter of factly, that are often missing in lesser films, even if only missed in great films. Watch Stardust Memories a few times, and it is like watching a different film each time, but in the best sense of the notion. There really is nothing more to say, is there?

It's certainly not difficult to see this Sydney Pollack feature alongside the likes of Serpico, Klute, Network The Candidate and my personal favourite The Parallax View amongst other contemporary, what I would term starry \/ lo-fi thrillers, all of them in their own ways depictions of different aspects of disillusionment and corruption within and cynicism with the US way of life particularly those we supposedly look up to, like the police, politicians, television and here the largely ungoverned CIA. I found much to savour but with some pretty major caveats too. Best of the former was certainly the cinematography, Pollack capturing excellently the mundaneness of an average rainy day at what appears on the face of it a run-of-the-mill literary society, only to deftly but shockingly explode the facade (the office is actually a front for a CIA intelligence gathering unit) with the ruthless execution of all its inhabitants, which fate Redford's character fortuitously escapes by ducking out to the local deli. So far so very good. Redford (the 70's Clooney or vice-versa, depending on your preference) is very good in a slummed-down, almost Bohemian characterisation, his vulnerability enhanced by his wearing of glasses, a million miles from the confident characters from his recent past, the Sundance Kid being the best known example. Uncertain, edgy, not knowing who to trust, he's left in the end to fend for himself as his paymasters turn on him. I was less convinced however with the encounter with Faye Dunaway's character, to me, an apparent sop to those who say that every film needs some male \/ female frisson. Fair enough, I suppose, but having strained for everyday realism up to that point, the way that her character, after being kidnapped, tied up and imprisoned in her own home by a desperate (if undeniably handsome) gun-toting Redford, almost naturally ends up that very night in bed with him, comes over as patronising to these eyes and ears. Some of their dialogue is poorly written too during these scenes of mutual discovery and detract from the narrative thrust.

Redford (the 70's Clooney or vice-versa, depending on your preference) is very good in a slummed-down, almost Bohemian characterisation, his vulnerability enhanced by his wearing of glasses, a million miles from the confident characters from his recent past, the Sundance Kid being the best known example.

Howard provides both humor and touching tear-jerking moments and handles them both very well. Then it leaves the all-star cast to give the performances of their career (Don Ameche is at his peak when he boogies like John Travolta in one scene).

Widely considered as the greatest political satire in film history, 'Dr. Strangelove' still carries vitality today, despite being over four decades removed from the height of Cold War tensions. The question that Kubrick poses, after all, is still with us what would happen if nuclear capabilities fell into the hands of a total madman? Such trouble is brewing in Kubrick's version of the Pentagon. General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), the paranoid commander of Burpelson Air Force Base, is convinced that American water supplies have become 'polluted' with fluoride in a vast Communist conspiracy. Ripper decides to unleash war on the Soviet Union by using a technicality in Wing Attack Plan R that allows him to send a fleet of patrolling B52s into nuclear counterattack on Russian targets. In the now-famous War Room, General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) must break the news to President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers), a weak but levelheaded figure modeled after Adlai Stevenson.While Muffley tries to negotiate with the drunken Soviet Premier via telephone, General Ripper is being sweet-talked by Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (Sellers), his Royal Air Force attaché, into revealing a three-letter code needed to access the B52s' radio systems and countermand the attacks. It is soon revealed by the Premier that his countrymen have built a 'doomsday machine' that will automatically explode if any nuclear attack occurs, much to the delight of Dr. Strangelove (yes, Sellers), a wheelchair-ridden Nazi physicist hired by the American government. A total retreat of the B52s becomes imperative as a plane headed by Major T. J. Kong (Slim Pickens), whose radio has been destroyed by enemy fire, stays determined to reach its target. The survival of mankind will hinge on this lone bomber, which is unfortunately run by competent pilots.Needless to say, 'Dr. Strangelove' hinges on the comic mastery of Peter Sellers, who had already filled the role of Clare Quilty in Kubrick's 'Lolita.' Sellers's portrayal of three men (including an interweave of Muffley and Strangelove) is a major comedic achievement that deserves his Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Sellers's primary talent is his total embodiment of character; he lives roles instead of merely 'playing' them. His working of all three personalities is complete and flawless. George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, and Slim Pickens are excellent in their supporting roles, conveying the film's berserk atmosphere. James Earl Jones also makes his cinema debut as a pilot on Major Kong's bomber; Tracy Reed appears in the only female part as Turgidson's secretary.'Dr. Strangelove,' at least in my opinion, plays out as a tongue-in-cheek satire rather than a laugh-out-loud farce. Much removed from 1964, the political implications of 'Strangelove' have a subtlety that has grown with time. Kubrick's decision to make the film comical rather than melodramatic (such as 'Fail Safe') was a brilliant one that shows the true absurdity of our Nuclear Arms Race gangs of oversexed half-wits playing out the fate of mankind like a poker hand. Nuclear armament reached our world from Pandora's Box in 1945, becoming a threat that can only be avoided with delicate juggling acts. A tough question is whether or not we're choosing the right jugglers and what the repercussions could be if there's a foul-up. As 'Dr. Strangelove' shows, it's not even animosity between nations that can result in nuclear war, but the tiniest flaw in a military's checks and balances.If there are any flaws to 'Dr. Strangelove,' it is moments of humor that are overripe; while Sellers portrays Strangelove brilliantly, the relative calm of Muffley and Mandrake cause him to look ham-fisted. The fact that General Ripper sets the three-letter code without anyone else's knowledge (including the Secretary of Defense) is also a huge plot gap that fortunately doesn't become noticeable. Satires will always have moments that do not entirely work, but 'Dr. Strangelove' has far more good moments than bad ones. Terry Southern's screenplay (adapted from the Peter George novel 'Red Alert') contains dazzling dialogue and uses stereotypes that only add to the film's comic value. And as long as there is international conflict, 'Dr. Strangelove' is guaranteed its social importance.'Dr. Strangelove' has enjoyed two incarnations on DVD, the first of which happened in 2001 as a Columbia Pictures 'special edition.' The 2001 disc presents 'Strangelove' in Kubrick's original filming ratio of 1.331, thus appearing on TV screens in full frame. Picture quality is fair, with noticeable grain that does not spoil the overall black-and-white effect. Audio is available in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese with subtitles in seven languages. Dolby-mastered sound brings across dialogue, sound effects, and Laurie Johnson's music clearly.Extras are aplenty, with everything you need to know about Strangelove's production. Supplemental material includes 'The Art of Stanley Kubrick From Short Films to Strangelove' and 'Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove,' two recently-made documentaries; footage of mock interviews with Peter Sellers and George C. Scott; a gallery of advertising spreads; bios of the film's lead actors; the theatrical trailer; and a four-page booklet with production notes. Columbia also retailed a 40th anniversary edition of 'Strangelove' on two discs in 2004, with enhanced audio options and further supplements.

One day in 1828, the same anonymous figure takes Kaspar out of his chamber, schools him on a handful of expressions and how to walk, and then leaves him standing still in a cobblestone court in Nuremberg. Kaspar is the focus of novelty and interest and is even put on display in a circus before being saved by an aristocrat who slowly and good-naturedly endeavors to renovate him.

What we are studying is both the character of the leads and the character of a way of life passing languidly before our eyes. Adapted for the screen from his Pulitzer Prize winning stage play by Alfred Uhry and directed by Bruce Beresford, who previously gave us the remarkable Aussie classic, Breaker Morant (1980), Driving Miss Daisy is one of those films that is a work of art as well as a sociological discovery. Using beautifully constructed scenes carefully observed, Beresford allows us to recall a way of life and a culture that characterized the South during the middle of the last century. Freeman's Hoke Colburn is black; and, as he mumbles, not all that much has changed since the days of slavery. He still has to yes'em and shuffle his feet and show deference to white folk just to get by. Miss Daisy Werthan herself is rich and very tight with her money. She is also as racially prejudiced as a Dixie sheriff, but blind to her prejudices as she rages against the infirmaries of age. The movie begins as she loses control of her car and drives it off the road and into a drainage ditch. She is shaken but unharmed. However her driving days are over. Her son Boolie Werthan, played with a fine touch and surprising restraint by comedian Dan Aykroyd, decides to get her a chauffeur. But she will not hear of it. She feels her independence is being threatened, and she doesn't need her son to tell her what to do. She can take care of herself. When Boolie arrives with Hoke, who is clearly black, Miss Daisy declares she will not have that man in her house. One feels very strongly at this point how compromised the infirm are when they must rely on help from others. Let a stranger into your house and there is no telling where it might end. More that this though, is the underlying idea that dependence on people from a lower social-economic class will in fact have a leveling effect on class distinctions, and this is again something that Miss Daisy (in her ignorance of herself) will not abide. But Hoke says he has wrestled some hogs in the mud in his time and has yet to let one get away, and he will do what is necessary to secure his position as Miss Daisy's driver. He comes highly recommended, and after listening to him, Boolie has little doubt he got the right man for the job. Miss Daisy of course is having none of it, and indeed she tells him to get out. She refuses to get into the car; she won't let him clean the chandelier or weed her garden. However, he doesn't give up. He takes all of her contrariness with good spirit and a sunny attitude, and then one day as she tries to go shopping on foot, he follows alongside of her in the car, and after some walking she is persuaded to hop in. On one level this is about racial politics in the South, circa mid- twentieth century, and on another level it is about growing old and coping with life as one grows old. It is about taking care of oneself and getting the most out of life despite the handicap of a declining body. This applies to both Hoke and Miss Daisy. He knows that the physical demands of a chauffeur are more appropriate to his age than some of the physical work he did when younger, and she knows that to live the full social life that she desires, she needs help in getting around. Naturally, as the film progresses they learn from one another. At first they are drawn together by her sharp wit and his appreciation of somebody who can speak the truth with a barb and not mince words. Later they are drawn closer together by their mutual strength of character and the plain fact that she needs a driver and he needs a job. But finally they are drawn together because they become, as she suddenly observes one day, best friends. This then is a story of love as well--love between two people from different walks of life. The differences are not just those of race and socio-economic status, or of religion and gender, but of world views and personal psychology, hers demanding and exacting, highbrow and imperial, his practical and easy-going, naturistic and democratic. A tide is turned when her temple is burned to the ground by the same ones as always as Hoke informs her, which forces Daisy to realize that her enemies are the same as his. Consequently she attends a speech given by Martin Luther King, Jr. He prefers to wait outside in the car and listen to it on the radio. At once we see the commonality of their understanding, but still the differences of their stations in life remain. The dream and the reality are meshing but slowly, as all things do in the Old South, or, for that matter, most anywhere. See this above all for the captivating performances by Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman, two of the great actors of our time, and for the touching and bittersweet story by Alfred Uhry. Also noteworthy is director Beresford's careful attention to detail and his unobtrusive guidance so that the film flows as sweetly as Tupelo honey on a warm southern day.

Fuller was basically a B film auteur, having made his reputation on 1950s and 1960s B war films (The Steel Helmet, Merrill's Marauders), and the famous- or infamous, Shock Corridor, yet The Big Red One, which was a fictionalization of his real World War Two experiences with the First Infantry Division of the U.S. Army, was, even in its bowdlerized version, considered his masterpiece. And it's a good solid war film. However, The Reconstruction version, adding in over forty-seven minutes on this two disk DVD version, is a truly great war film, and ranks only below Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line and Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now as the greatest war film ever made. I would rank it with Regeneration, Patton, and Full Metal Jacket as the head of the next tier of war films. However, unlike Coppola's expanded Apocalypse Now Redux DVD version, with its questionable reinstatement of some bloated and unnecessary scenes, all of the restored scenes in the restored version of Fuller's film only enhance this film's narrative and characterization.The tale is straightforward, and told from a GI's perspective, rather than from some omniscient eye in the sky. It is lean, filled with little moments, shorn of much visual poesy, yet, despite that, it is very poetic, albeit in totally different ways than the films of Malick and Coppola, which were self-conscious art films, in the best sense of the word. As in all of Fuller's war films, we know these men from just a few brushstrokes, but they are not stereotypes, like the ridiculously banal grunts in Steven Spielberg's ridiculous schlocksterpiece Saving Private Ryan. The main characters are five Americans and one German. The leader of the Americans is an unnamed sergeant (although he is sometimes called Possum) who starts the film, and ends World War One, killing a surrendering German soldier with his knife, four hours after the Armistice, and the violation of that code of war haunts him ever after. The scene, shot in black and white, and highlighted by a shell-shocked horse's attack on Marvin, under a large crucifix, is beautifully wrought, acted, and written, and sets the film's tone about the enduring irrationality and absurdity of war without having to delve into comedy like M*A*S*H or Catch-22 do&#133;. All of this, plus the eye level view of a grunt, make this film something special. And, unlike Oliver Stone, Fuller does not need to wave his political banner in a viewer's face. Also, Lee Marvin is simply fantastic- this is his greatest role, and he should have won an Oscar for it, even though Hollywood would never honor a man like Fuller. Compared to Tom Hanks' sergeant in Spielberg's garbage, Marvin's is the kind of man men would follow into battle, and die for. The reconstructed film opens with the quote, 'This is fictional life based on factual death,' and ends with an epitaph for Fuller. Never has a film's epigraph been more on target, nor more poignant. The Big Red One The Reconstruction will be de rigueur viewing for war film buffs as long as films are watched. Who needs an Oscar with that sort of legacy?

As in all of Fuller's war films, we know these men from just a few brushstrokes, but they are not stereotypes, like the ridiculously banal grunts in Steven Spielberg's ridiculous schlocksterpiece Saving Private Ryan. The main characters are five Americans and one German. The leader of the Americans is an unnamed sergeant (although he is sometimes called Possum) who starts the film, and ends World War One, killing a surrendering German soldier with his knife, four hours after the Armistice, and the violation of that code of war haunts him ever after. The scene, shot in black and white, and highlighted by a shell-shocked horse's attack on Marvin, under a large crucifix, is beautifully wrought, acted, and written, and sets the film's tone about the enduring irrationality and absurdity of war without having to delve into comedy like M*A*S*H or Catch-22 do&#133;. All of this, plus the eye level view of a grunt, make this film something special. And, unlike Oliver Stone, Fuller does not need to wave his political banner in a viewer's face. Also, Lee Marvin is simply fantastic- this is his greatest role, and he should have won an Oscar for it, even though Hollywood would never honor a man like Fuller. Compared to Tom Hanks' sergeant in Spielberg's garbage, Marvin's is the kind of man men would follow into battle, and die for. The reconstructed film opens with the quote, 'This is fictional life based on factual death,' and ends with an epitaph for Fuller. Never has a film's epigraph been more on target, nor more poignant. The Big Red One The Reconstruction will be de rigueur viewing for war film buffs as long as films are watched. Who needs an Oscar with that sort of legacy?

And by that I mean worldwide, not just the obvious flaws of the Hollywood crap factory. Lean, spare, poetic- it tells one story, but tells it very well, and that story becomes universal, and is applicable to all people who have ever suffered, or been driven to do desperate things. Its screenplay is deceptively slight, but that does not mean it is not great. Oftentimes, it is assumed that a great screenplay must be witty like Woody Allen films, deep like Ingmar Bergman films, or characteristically complex like Robert Altman films, but great screenplays can also be the antithesis of those things. A great screenplay may be like that in Stanley Kubrick's for 2001 A Space Odyssey, full of symbolism writ large, and on the other hand, it can be like The Bicycle Thief, which is symbolic precisely because it is so intensely personal.The film is almost pitch perfect from beginning to end, yet, as often happens, something is lost in the translation of its title, Ladri Di Biciclette, which literally means Bicycle Thieves, but in America is known as The Bicycle Thief. The original title is more literally true, as both the 'real' thief and Antonio, steal bikes, and it also allows for a deeper look at their differing motivations. When we see the original thief's one room apartment- with mother and two other siblings- we see that he, too, is poor, and we have to wonder if he is Antonio on the future, with just a bit more desperation. Yes, he's obviously a skilled con man, but he may have started out pure, as well. This deeper look is lost in the Americanized title, for while technically Antonio is a thief, he is truly forced into it, lest his family will be even more degraded, while the young thief is likely merely using external circumstances to justify his black soul. De Sica wisely does not opt out for that simplistic end, though, for we still have the contrast between the professional thief, and the rank amateur, Antonio.Many critics have reduced this film to De Sica's supposed refutation of a simple false dualism- that De Sica is merely trying to show good and evil are relative, but the film clearly is NOT doing that, for we know, all along, that the young professional thief would likely be a con man regardless. All of his neighbors are cheats and liars, as he has likely been accused many times before, and even his mother lies for her manifestly guilty son. De Sica recognizes that there IS good and evil, but that sometimes an act that appears evil- such as thievery, can be born of different circumstances; pure evil and greed, as in the case of the young thief, and mere desperation, as with Antonio. Ironically, many of the critics who chide viewers for their supposed biases against the young thief, show their own biases in wholly missing De Sica's actual point- which is not to show that there are differing reasons for similar acts, but that the reasons CAN be night and day, yet still be confused, and that usually, and regardless, it is the honest who are screwed either way.Even worse, are those stolid critics with a political ax to grind. Marxists somehow got it into their heads that Antonio, who is clearly shown as living in squalor, is a member of the bourgeoisie, simply because he wears a fedora, not a cap, or because his wife has clean bedsheets, thus when he gets a job, it is symbolic of governmental favoritism for an elite class, and the young bike thief, who wears a German hat, is a member of the international proletariat, although he clearly is a member of the criminal class, and in that conflation much of Marxist theology bogs down. The theft of Antonio's bike is therefore claimed as a revolutionary act, and his lying neighbors are just good workers defending a comrade. That Antonio is left bereft, at film's end, to Marxists, symbolizes a perverse justice. To point out all the ridiculous flaws in such super-simplistic ideas would waste time, but, clearly, the only reason such absurd claims were made were because the screenwriter, Cesare Zavattini, who adapted the film from a novel by Luigi Bartolini, was a member of the Italian Communist Party, at the time. Interestingly, the film has also been seen as a very Conservative film, praised by Christian groups and even William F. Buckley's The National Review, not because it delineates good and evil, as described above, but because they see it as a refutation of Marxist ideals, in that Antonio and the other laborers do not find work degrading, but a fundament of their self worth; so much so that when the young thief kyboshes Antonio's ability to gain that self respect, he loses all hope, and is reduced to dishonesty himself.Neither reductivist outlook adequately deals with the many subtleties and nuances this great film portrays, and the fact that The Bicycle Thief is shorn of Freudian psychobabble and preaching is one of its strengths. Yet, it is not pure cinema, either, as many European critics have labeled it. Although the visuals convey the milieu well, they do not get inside the characters. This is where the writing and acting ability of Maggiorani and Staiola works magic. Great art is simply not so easily reducible as political panderers want it to be, and one can be thankful for that, lest The Bicycle Thief would not be what it is, nor would we still be watching it with such easy appreciation for its simple virtues.

The reason for this devolves down to one basic fact- it's merely a melodrama, not a true drama. Melodrama always depends upon the propulsion of the plot by the characters within doing the dumbest possible things to get to the next scene. Melodrama thrives on the lowest common denominator. This, of course, does not lessen the enjoyability of the melodrama- be it Hollywood film, soap opera, pro wrestling, etc., but it does remove the work sufficiently from the realistic so that it shows its artifice too much, and therefore never fully involves an engaged viewer.Strangers On A Train includes many recurring Hitchcockian themes- the wrongly accused man, doubles, guilt, assumptions, and, yes, homosexuality. This was a film that came out only a few years after Hitchcock's homosexually themed Rope, in 1948, and even has one of that film's stars- Farley Granger, in this film's lead role. Again, he is a weakling character controlled by a cunning, psychopathic character with definite homosexual leanings; only this time Granger does not play a homosexual character. The film was based upon the first published novel of Patricia Highsmith, whose later Ripley novels earned her the nickname Mistress Of Suspense, in counterpoint to Hitchcock's moniker as Master Of Suspense. The film was adapted for Hitchcock by Whitfield Cook, then handed over to crime novelist Raymond Chandler, who wanted to change many elements. Hitchcock resisted, then gave the final job of adding dialogue to Czenzi Ormonde, and an uncredited Ben Hecht. It's a good screenplay, but, as with many Hitchcock films, it's almost all surface. The depth in most Hitchcock films comes from the actors and their subtleties, not the written words. In this sense Hitchcock's reputation as the ultimate puppetmaster is well earned. Depth was the reason the film was made and actors hired, or else Hitchcock would likely have been satisfied with his storyboards published as early graphic novels&#133;. I suspect that the reason that this film has been ignored, in favor of lesser Hitchcockian fare like Suspicion, To Catch A Thief, or The Man Who Knew Too Much, is because none of the stars in it were superstars. The above mentioned were all good solid works, but they lacked the depth this film does, on however a superficially 'deep' level, in contrast to similar films coming out from Europe at the same time. But, it certainly is a very good film, by any measure, with some deeper subtexts than the script alone entails. If only Hitchcock had been more at home in probing deeper into motivations, and grounding some of his films in reality more, he could have moved past being a mere technical genius, and graced the realm of high art more often than he did, that realm where the European directors did not fear to tread, where high art and mass appeal were not seen as mutually opposing forces. Strangers On A Train is almost a definitive, or archetypal, Hitchcock film in that it has all his film canon's glories and flaws. It is not film noir, nor is it really a thriller, as commonly thought of. We know what is going on at all times, so the suspense is not a whodunit? but a willthevillainsucceed? And it is a darkly comic one at that. Humor is used to gloss over many failures in life, and this film proves that statement true. When you watch Strangers On A Train you will wince, chuckle, smile, shake your head, be frustrated and relaxed, and if that is not the sign of a work of art that does more right than wrong, there are always new Hollywood releases to watch and wince to.

A weakness easily overlooked.The plot takes them to a fairy tale Morocco, more Arabian Nights and Hollywood than French colony. The men wear white suits and fez caps or turbans. The women wear diaphanous veils and tiaras. Dorothy Lamour turns up as a princess who, her fortune tellers say, must marry a man she cares nothing about because he is fated to die a violent death within the week, freeing Lamour to marry the powerful sheik Anthony Quinn. That man she cares nothing about and chooses to marry is Bob Hope. Crosby muscles in on Hope, not knowing what the sooth sayers sayeth.It's all nonsensical and none of it is taken seriously by the actors, the writers, or the viewers. Even when Crosby is serenading Lamour with a pretty little ballad, Moonlight Becomes You, he tries to pick a rose to bring her and pricks his finger instead. Some of the sight gags are pretty amusing -- Crosby and Hope imitating mechanical men, when a fly lands on Hope's nose. It's not the only joke involving Hope's notorious nose, and there's a reference to the size of Crosby's ears as well. I don't want to reveal too many of the amusing incidents, but I always laugh when a girl tries to wake up Hope. He shrugs her off, rolls over in bed, and mumbles, Okay, Ma, I'll get a job tomorrow. And Crosby's line Junior, how can you do this to me? Why we went to school together. We were in the same class for years -- until I got promoted.The script has no hesitation in breaking the fourth wall or slinging anachronisms, self references, or in-jokes around. When Hope asks how they got out of the tight spot we last saw them in, Crosby looks at the camera suspiciously, then leans over and whispers his reply into Hope's ear in order to keep it a secret from us. Some of the gags may be lost on younger, less sophisticated viewers. Aunt Lucy shows up as a ghost, giving advice and scolding the two men from time to time. Crosby makes some comment about Aunt Lucy's being dead but you can't keep her down. Not Aunt Lucy, Hope agrees, She's a Republican. (Kids This movie was made midway through the unprecedented, and now illegal, third term of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a Democrat.) I've always enjoyed the relationship between Hope and Crosby in these movies. Both are greedy, libidinous cowards, ready to double cross one another at the first glimpse of a dollar bill or a woman's ankle. (In this one, Crosby sells Hope into slavery to pay for a restaurant meal.) But neither is superior to the other in any way, unlike other popular comedy teams such as Abbott and Costello or Martin and Lewis. These guys are both equally stupid and despicable.Lots of fun.

Well, maybe Zanzibar was at the top, with Utopia not far behind. The climax in this one depends a little too much on minor gimmicks like dribbling glasses, exploding cigarettes, and whoopee cushions. A weakness easily overlooked.The plot takes them to a fairy tale Morocco, more Arabian Nights and Hollywood than French colony. The men wear white suits and fez caps or turbans. The women wear diaphanous veils and tiaras. Dorothy Lamour turns up as a princess who, her fortune tellers say, must marry a man she cares nothing about because he is fated to die a violent death within the week, freeing Lamour to marry the powerful sheik Anthony Quinn. That man she cares nothing about and chooses to marry is Bob Hope.

Watching this movie - which, to the best of my memory, I had never actually seen all the way through before - I was reminded of the lavishly-filmed travelogues that they used to show in movie theaters between pictures back in the 1950s. (World travel in those days was a LOT more expensive than it is now, so for most people travelogues were the only way they were going to see the world.) And that is what this movie is. The plot, which everyone knew, is strictly incidental, a framework on which to hang one magnificently filmed travelogue after the next. In that sense, it was a very original movie, and certainly deserved the Oscar for best picture, though the acting is at best incidental. This was a triumph of movie technology and inventive vision, not a dramatic work.One could, I suppose, quibble about the treatment of Verne's text. Casting a Mexican comedian as the very French valet Passepartout did strike me as strange, for example. Sometimes he even forgot that he was playing a Frenchman and said Señor rather than Monsieur. And, of course, with his accent, which he made no attempt to disguise, no one was going to mistake him for French. Since Fernandel has one of the many cameos in this movie, I thought that he might have made a more authentic choice, as he was not just French but a great actor, both in drama and in comedy. Still, this movie is just based on Verne's novel, not meant to be a faithful adaptation of it. Since Passepartout's nationality is only incidental to the action, it didn't really matter that he was so clearly not French. The same would apply to the other infidelities to the novel. The actual purpose of Verne's novel, however, not just this one but most of them, was to provide adventure-coated geography and history lessons to young boys. Verne's books were sold as educational, and Verne did do a lot of research for them. (He wasn't always good at making that research interesting; the long technical descriptions of underwater flora and fauna in 20000 Leagues under the Sea make for slow reading even for an adult.)In that sense this movie very much captures the spirit of the novel, even if it changes parts of it it provides a VERY entertaining way of getting to know the visual wonders of the world. This is truly a picture to be seen in a theater with a big screen, though. I enjoyed it on my TV, but kept thinking how much more overwhelming it would have been in a theater with a wide screen.Treat yourself to it.

There is something very unlikeable and unrealistic about most of the characters in this film. The thing that bothers me the most is the foul language. When Kathyrn Erbe (who plays the wife, Maggie) confronts Tom (played by Kevin Bacon), she crudely confronts him over his vision of a woman who's been haunting their house; she blurts out, Did you f--k her? Not only does this unsubtle, heavy-handed type of dialogue crop up way too often during the film (and spoken by too many of the characters), it also makes the characters wholly unsympathetic. Don't any of them have any wit or a sense of humor or are they all crude boors who like to get into arguments with one another? Koepp based 'Stir of Echoes' on a 1958 tale by Richard Matheson (of Twilight Zone fame). The inciting incident, where Tom is hypnotized and begins seeing visions seems quite dated. Hypnosis might have been a big thing for a movie audience in 1958 but by the late 90s it's old hat! I would have liked to have seen something a little more clever and original to propel Tom into his supernatural world.Many of the characters' actions in this film are way too over the top. I didn't quite believe that the babysitter would kidnap Jake simply because she heard him talking about her missing sister. Most normal teenagers would have calmly told their parents about their suspicions and the parents could have then contacted the police to investigate. Perhaps the most unbelievable part of the film is Maggie's reaction to Tom's obsessions. She visits her friend the hypnotist who advises her to get help for Tom; but she never follows through. She decides to do everything on her own. Even if you believe that she never notices anything peculiar about her child's behavior (especially Jake telling her to hire the babysitter), she totally ignores everything the psychic cop tells her (spelling it out that her husband has partial psychic powers and the son is fully psychic). She goes home and ends up having another argument with Tom over his visions. It's just too unbelievable that she continues to believe Tom is out of his mind.Koepp implies that Maggie fears humiliation from her working class friends if word gets out that Tom has lost his marbles and that's why she gains no insight into what's going on. I don't really buy it given all the clues put in front of her but even if one accepts Koepp's scenario, a real person probably would have gone for some outside help.Koepp settles for some over the top banter between husband and wife with Tom insisting that Maggie has been trying to stop him from discovering the most important thing in my life. In the silliest scene in the movie, Kevin Bacon, sounding like someone who forgot to take his medication, repeats I won't stop three times as Maggie tries to get him to stop digging up the body. Koepp needs a device to get Maggie out of the house so Tom is left alone for the killers to appear and try and do him in. So out of the blue, Maggie's mother dies and she takes Jake and leaves the house. Even way before the resolution where the bad guys are dispatched, it seems pretty obvious that a bunch of locals killed the missing girl so I didn't find the film's denouement very gripping. There are a few scenes in Stir of Echoes that are too drawn out. Koepp could have cut about 10 minutes from the exposition before the hypnosis scene. The same goes for all the digging Kevin Bacon was doing at the end. Koepp has certainly made a name for himself in Hollywood, penning the the two Spielberg films, 'War of the Worlds' and 'Indiana Jones', which showed a marked improvement over the insufferable Spiderman. Now that he is a prime player in Hollywood, perhaps he might consider tackling subject matter that is intellectually on a higher plane. Certainly 'Stir of Echoes', his earlier effort, will never enter the pantheon of memorable films in the future.

She goes home and ends up having another argument with Tom over his visions. It's just too unbelievable that she continues to believe Tom is out of his mind.Koepp implies that Maggie fears humiliation from her working class friends if word gets out that Tom has lost his marbles and that's why she gains no insight into what's going on. I don't really buy it given all the clues put in front of her but even if one accepts Koepp's scenario, a real person probably would have gone for some outside help.Koepp settles for some over the top banter between husband and wife with Tom insisting that Maggie has been trying to stop him from discovering the most important thing in my life. In the silliest scene in the movie, Kevin Bacon, sounding like someone who forgot to take his medication, repeats I won't stop three times as Maggie tries to get him to stop digging up the body. Koepp needs a device to get Maggie out of the house so Tom is left alone for the killers to appear and try and do him in. So out of the blue, Maggie's mother dies and she takes Jake and leaves the house. Even way before the resolution where the bad guys are dispatched, it seems pretty obvious that a bunch of locals killed the missing girl so I didn't find the film's denouement very gripping. There are a few scenes in Stir of Echoes that are too drawn out. Koepp could have cut about 10 minutes from the exposition before the hypnosis scene. The same goes for all the digging Kevin Bacon was doing at the end. Koepp has certainly made a name for himself in Hollywood, penning the the two Spielberg films, 'War of the Worlds' and 'Indiana Jones', which showed a marked improvement over the insufferable Spiderman. Now that he is a prime player in Hollywood, perhaps he might consider tackling subject matter that is intellectually on a higher plane. Certainly 'Stir of Echoes', his earlier effort, will never enter the pantheon of memorable films in the future.

And it fits her character so deeply, as she is the critical type, an unassumingly feminine vessel of healing and servility, on whose shoulder you want to rest your head. She is a suburban English housewife who tells her story in voice over in the first person while at home with her husband, imagining that she is coming clean about her affair to him. The story begins as she hazards into the neighboring town for shopping and to the cinema for a matinée, by herself and generally content with that. Coming back from one of these weekly outings, at the station she gets a speck of gravel in her eye which is dabbed away by another passenger. Both are middle-aged, married, and have children. The other passenger, a doctor played by Trevor Howard, eventually divulges his enthusiasm for preventive medicine. Taking pleasure in each another's companionship, the two plan to meet again. They are soon worried to find their blameless and relaxed rapport swiftly growing into love.Most love stories, especially now, portray the characters' falling in love as an incident that has propelled the story. Brief Encounter, one of the few love stories to march to a different tune, is only about the spark and deepening and situational turmoil of love, laying bare the definition of it, its lack of any commonsense safety net, its random context, its power to make two people feel idealistic about themselves and ultimately about the two extreme extents of emotion in which it can leave you. And for this, a film must draw out the most personal familiarity with it all of each actor, the writer and the director. It is an emboldening task.Rachmaninoff's music emphasizes the uncontrollable feelings that put at risk the trustworthy tedium of the couple's otherwise normal romantic lives. The black-and-white cinematography, discernible by both stylishness and uncommon realism augments the story gradually with the most beautifully realistic tones and atmospheric Englishness.Brief Encounter carries Noel Coward's tenderly and sensitively in depth and perceptive script to radiant life, extracting lyricism and poetry from the most, to all appearances, ordinary doing. Trevor Howard gives a distinct performance, and Dame Commander of the British Empire Celia Johnson realizes a heartbreakingly wise, even moving portrayal of complete self- possession.
