Despite the fact I would probably kill myself, if I were committed in real life, if I had a holodeck from Star Trek, you could only guess the scenarios I'd be creating for myself. Okay, so I am biased. Mental Hospitals give me great me pleasures, even when I just think of them. It's something about a person being considered non-accountable and not of sound psyche as well as being worthy of confinement for just their demeanor and attitudes that I think with me really just strikes bunches of chords. So, upon seeing a movie that did not only meet that but heterosexually fascination of women I immediately sought it out. However, such a non-sexual fetish as this is not something you would want to make public, so I naturally was very discrete in both how I reacted to this film and how I sought it out. I can't watch the movie without yelling at the characters, and I'm always afraid that someone at the library will wonder what a male like me is doing renting a movie like that with the amount of times I do. So, what is the movie itself? Well, it's a women's late 1960s half melodrama\/half life passing as we adventure and experience the world drama. It's very well-acted but the material is at time's cringe-worthy. What really makes the film is just how effectively it emobdies its setting and attitudes of the characters. As for the former we really feel like we're in a mental hospital. This isn't raving lunatics and great horrors. It's a locked summer camp for sane young adults, who were bought down by the man. This is the type of place I would find myself lying on my couch imagining I was in. In terms of the latter, you could never accuse the film of not developing its characters, because one of the things it does amazingly masterpiece level way is make clear the way that all the characters view their lives and situations. We really understand why they all do what they do and feel what they feel as well why they are in the positions they are in. It's tragic and it sucks you into the story like few other films have by crafting a portrait of people who seem real, for they might as well be real people (whom they were based off) because our understanding of them is great. Even, though I can objectively say that One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a better film, the characters don't have anything on this movie. This film has a lot that goes for it, but then again, it's just eaten up by me. There are so many ingredients for transcendent cinema here, and although I experience that because it is almost like a film made for me, I wouldn't know about that with other people. The thing is I couldn't possibly judge how a normal person would see this film. It's terribly manipulative and the ending is totally untrue. This is what they movies that are favorites but not best ofs. Actually, when I think of it, if it weren't for that untrue ending and manipulation, this could have been a experience I could truly consider to be great. The vibrancy of the characters had a ridiculous amount going for them, and I could only (and do in my spare time) imagine how great it really could have been had the characters stayed truer to their nature. I really should write a fanfiction.

With the help of the down-and-out horror movie icon Bela Lugosi (brilliant performance by Martin Landau) and a reluctant team of showbiz misfits, Ed creates the cinematic anti-masterpieces of his own desire. Undaunted by the cutthroat criticism of the film industry, Ed stumbles on with his passion, door knocking for funds, facing rejection, tragedy, and heartbreak, all leading to the creation of his most infamous motion picture...Compelling, engaging, and frequently hilarious, Ed Wood has an all-star cast providing brilliant performances from Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, Bill Murray, and others. By being filmed in black and white, the movie is able to accomplish the nostalgic effect that is critical in emphasizing the heart of the B-Movie era of the 1950s. One of the central questions which the film raises is if Ed Wood was truly the worst the directer of all time. Many understandably think so due to his incompetent directing skills, penniless budgets, and the-first-take-is-perfect philosophy. However, with this film, it's almost impossible not to have sympathy for the devil of film-making. Ed really was passionate about film-making and really didn't care about the scathing reviews or cardboard sets, because, as he says in the film, movies are about the big picture.

But I remember reading King's intro at the beginning, in which he talked about having come of age in the '60s, and how this has influenced his work.Well, I would say that the movie Hearts in Atlantis - based on one of the short stories from the book - gives the that impression. Like Stand by Me and It, the movie portrays working-class children around 1960 whose only escape from the world's unpleasantness is each other. In this case, young Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin) lives with his widowed mother (Hope Davis). Unfortunately, she considers him a nuisance at best she practically ignores him and spends all her money on fancy clothes for herself. But one day, stranger Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins) rents the room upstairs. Bobby suspects that there's something unusual, almost magical, about Ted. But who else might know about this? As is the case with King's other looks back at childhood, this one gets told as a flashback, with Bobby's older self (David Morse) thinking about the repercussions of everything that happened.

Moving too fast but not going anywhere, but it sure is beautiful but in an emotionally devestating way.

Soon she heads to a town so small that it is not on the map and becomes ingratiated with a family, involving ex-cons and falls in love but in a way that is so viscerally desperate yet unadulterdly emotional that truly it is one of the most realistically powerful romances ever felt on screen. I do not exaggerate when I saw it captures the real emotion of that type of love unlike any other film out there.What happens is inevitable, considering its based on an actual story, yet the romance is so beautiful and so true, it almost feels as if the film enters into a realm beneath the material.

The infamous reputation of Deliverance preceded it and perhaps was too talked about because the film did not live up to it's reputation in my opinion. While decently acted, and with terrific cinematography of the Cahulawassee River the film deals more with the guilt and cover up of friends protecting themselves from a pair of insane mountain men who stalk and harass them. I thought the film would be far more dark, gritty, gory and disturbing and I know it seems as though many people look at me with shock and dismay and say 'are you kidding?' Maybe I'm warped and worn by the modern day gore of shockers and horror films but I didn't find Deliverance all that disturbing. I understand where it was trying to go psychologically but I found Burt Reynolds' more disturbing than any other character and the film was just average over all. I had heard about the sexual 'heinousness' of a particular scene involving Ned Beatty and of course the scene was humiliating for him but far from sexually deviant as the man is killed before he performs any travesties. Overall it was just an average adventure film with a decent story about a horrible experience than the friends work to cover up.Jon Voight plays Ed Gentry, the very soft spoken but strong member of the team. Voight's performance was decent but nothing stand out about it I didn't think. He was in the background most of the time defending Reynolds and never really did anything truly spectacular with the exception of the scene where he scales the rock wall to take out their would-be killer. Burt Reynolds was really the only stand out performance as boisterous, loud, and masculine Lewis Medlock who is the experience of their group. Medlock is firey and almost obsessively compulsive after he is forced to kill a man to save his friend. His performance is one of the best in the film. Ned Beatty plays the weaker and more manipulated Bobby Trippe who finds himself the worst of victims out of all of them. Beatty is very good in the role, especially given his usual comic performances but nothing stand out in his character either. Ronny Cox rounds out the foursome playing the voice of reason Drew Ballinger. A family man who finds himself in a situation he doesn't want to be in and causes him to almost break sanity at one point. Cox is very good and does a good job in his character and it was only unfortunate that he didn't get a bigger role. He also gets to take part in film history by performing the famous 'dueling banjos' scene at the very beginning of the film.I guess the artistic flavor of the film just goes over me. I don't see Deliverance as the dark and torturistic vision that it claims to be in history. I don't understand the guilt and fear that the men feel having killed a man who literally physically stalked and harmed them and was preparing to rape and kill them. No one in their right mind would have accused of them anything more than self protection and preservation. As stated before the story is good and the characters are watchable, I just wasn't blown away or mentally disturbed by the content of this film like so many people claim the film is. Still it is a classic and by right you must see it...the good news is the infamous dueling banjo's is almost right off the bat so you can get the joke any time any one hums the tune. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 April 2007","score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" It took me a long time to get around to this pop culture classic that I had heard so much about.

Being someone fairly interested\/talented in math and science, I was absolutely lost as to the entire mathematical\/scientific storyline being completely bogus. After reading some reviews, people don't even seem to mind. 'It's fine the storyline makes no sense,' no, it's really not. That alone was enough to turn me off, but the bad sound (Was that what it was? The music and effects just really started to irritate me, who knows) and over-the-top acting just made it worse.I'm all for independent cinema, in fact that's the career I'm seriously considering at the moment, but independent is NOT in any way, shape or form an excuse for bad. Writing a scientific, mathematically themed script with 100% bogus science and math is absolutely wrong. Film makers are expected to have done research and know what they are talking about.

For a film that came out almost 10 years ago, it seems just slightly ahead its time. I don't remember everything about 1998, but I do know that things like DVD was in it's nascent stages and although the internet has been part of our vernacular for almost 20 years now, the technology prevalent back in 98 as opposed to now is light years apart. And in the post 911 days, having the idea of our privacy abolished is pretty much upon us. Maybe not to the extent perpetuated in this film, but we are pretty much under Big Brother's watchful eye all the time. When you walk into a bank, a restaurant, a convenience store or any public place, you are photographed and recorded and your image can be recalled with a simple enough click of a button. Even today when you call places like phone company's or pizza parlours you hear a recorded message that says this call may be recorded for quality purposes. We are being watched and kept tabs on everywhere we go and in everything we do. In this vein, Enemy of the State is a marvel. It is a film way ahead of it's time. No one could foresee the tragedy of 911, but now that it is part of our history books, films like The Siege and this one are that much more clairvoyant.Will Smith plays a Washington attorney whose life is turned inside out when he is given a disc that has a political murder on it. He doesn't know that it does and when an unsanctioned government spook squad comes after him, he is confused and out of his element. Gene Hackman plays Brill, who might as well be an older version of Harry Cauld, his character from Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 film The Conversation. He is a communications expert that has basically gone mercenary and no longer does the dirty work for the CIA and other seedy government factions. Smith needs his help attempting to understand what it all means and how he got entangled in this imbroglio. While Smith is the star of the film, it is clearly Hackman that steals the show with his vernacular and expertise on the subject.The film is also blessed with so many bit players that are now either famous or semi famous that it's like watching a Robert Altman film such as The Player. There are that many famous faces in here. Barry Pepper, Jake Busey, Jack Black, Jaime Kennedy, Jason Lee, Gabriele Byrne, Tom Sizemore and Jason Robards all show up in the film in supporting roles. Add to that the incomparable Jon Voight and you have one hell of a cast.Enemy of the State moves at a break neck pace.

The story centers around a group of 'vampire hunters', led by Jack Crow (James Woods), who are a secret service summoned by the Vatican to exterminate the bloodthirsty demons. His group roams around the desert, hunting the 'nests' of vampires and exterminating them. But their routine vampire hunting becomes everything but routine when they stumble upon the Master vampire, Valek. While chasing Valek through the desert on his bloody rampage, they meet a prostitute named Katrina (Sheryl Lee), who has a psychic link to the master vampire. It's up to the remaining people on the team to stop Valek, who is searching for an ancient cross that will give all vampires the ability to walk in sunlight - which could result in dire consequences for mankind.Exactly twenty years after John Carpenter directed and released the horror legend Halloween, he brought us this extremely entertaining, popcorn vampire flick. I liked the storyline for this movie, and the entire spin with the Catholic church and the powerful crucifix (giving the vampires the ability to walk in daylight) set this apart from most vampire-themed horror movies in the sense that it isn't too conventional. These vampires aren't easy to kill. Scratch the garlic, that doesn't do anything. They aren't flamboyant or seductive - they're bloodthirsty demons, and the only way to kill them is a stake to the heart. Sure, there are quite a few plot holes here and the script isn't perfect, but these aren't large matters considering the type of film this is. There is almost a campy sense in this movie, because it is hard to take too seriously on many occasions, although I think this might add to it's overall charm. There is also a few light dashes of black humor to be found as well, but nothing too over-the-top. This film still strives to maintain its seriousness.The cast is actually pretty good here as well. James Woods is our leading hero, and he plays a cynical bad-ass. He's a great actor and I've enjoyed his work in the films that I've seen him in, and this one is no exception. Daniel Baldwin is the secondary hero, and is also good. Sheryl Lee plays the psychic prostitute, and while her character might sound a little ridiculous, she plays it well and her character is of big importance in the story. Vampires also boasts some really amazing special effects. Digital effects are minimal, most are really realistic looking and really disgusting (this movie isn't light on the gore). I have to give some credit to the special effects supervisor, because it was a job well done. There's some really well-executed actions sequences as well, and the battles with the vampires are truly engaging.Overall, Vampires is a good vampire horror movie that is worth a look for fans of the genre and\/or the theme. It's not a perfect movie by any means (and it's definitely not something I would have expected from Carpenter), but the story is decent (also with some great action sequences) and entertaining nonetheless.

James Woods is our leading hero, and he plays a cynical bad-ass. He's a great actor and I've enjoyed his work in the films that I've seen him in, and this one is no exception. Daniel Baldwin is the secondary hero, and is also good. Sheryl Lee plays the psychic prostitute, and while her character might sound a little ridiculous, she plays it well and her character is of big importance in the story. Vampires also boasts some really amazing special effects. Digital effects are minimal, most are really realistic looking and really disgusting (this movie isn't light on the gore). I have to give some credit to the special effects supervisor, because it was a job well done. There's some really well-executed actions sequences as well, and the battles with the vampires are truly engaging.Overall, Vampires is a good vampire horror movie that is worth a look for fans of the genre and\/or the theme. It's not a perfect movie by any means (and it's definitely not something I would have expected from Carpenter), but the story is decent (also with some great action sequences) and entertaining nonetheless. Recommended if you like seeing some vampires do their thing. 6\/10. ","genre":"Action, Horror, Thriller"}]
