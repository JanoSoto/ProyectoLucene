A Jew making fun of Jews, a Black making fun of Blacks, two Western Americans making fun of the West, movie makers making fun of the movies. The childish fart-level humor and utter cornball gags keep you rolling of the floor unable to breathe. This movie doesn't pretend to be anything more than cornball humor, but it's the all-time best at that. Let's not pretend to be intelligent adults, let's just watch this gem and laugh our heads off like the kids we are inside. Downsides are the overuse of swear words, which were funny in the early 70's because of their shock value during those censored times, but today are just annoying and unnecessary. Another annoying scene is the sexual perversion when Hedley makes love to the statue, though it's funny that the creep gets horny over the thought of money, it creeps me out. But the strength of the movie is its originality for its day, long before the Zuckors. The jokes come so fast and so unexpectedly that you can watch this movie many times before you catch them all.

Knowing this in advance, I certainly had a few expectations about this movie. Not that I thought this would be an intelligent movie, because when you are about to see a comedy with the Wayans brothers, you know what you can expect a lot of vulgar and pre-teen humor. Still, that doesn't mean that they can't be good fun from time to time and seeing a parody on about every famous movie is a nice pass-time, like the first Scary Movie already proved a year earlier.In Scary Movie 2 four teens are tricked by their professor and his paralyzed assistant into visiting the haunted Hell House for a school project about sleep disorders. In this house a bad exorcism took place and the ghost still lives there. Chaos starts as soon as they arrive. They meet the creepy caretaker of the house, have to face the evil spirit and will have to solve some dark secrets, no matter how disgusting they are...I admit that I liked Scary Movie and normally I'm also a fan of other spoof movies like for instance Hot Shots or The Naked Gun, but this movie certainly didn't do it for me. This wasn't just vulgar, it just wasn't very good. The beginning with the exorcism was quite funny and the movie certainly had its better moments, but the overall quality of the story and the acting were so low that it really started to annoy me. Take for instance the fact that all the characters from the first movie are back, even when they died in that one. That can only mean that the story and the sense of reality (although that is perhaps not the exact word for this kind of movies, but you know what I mean), weren't of any importance. The only thing that mattered was the extra profit this movie would be worth. They didn't even have the time to come up with something new or original, making this movie feel like it was written in a couple of weeks time with a crate of whiskey and 10 joints per man...The jokes and gags that the Wayans brothers and their enormous team of writers, producers,... came up with were clearly inspired on the first movie. Never change a winning team they say, but sometimes the audience wants to see an underdog win. They don't want to see the same thing over and over again, they want something new and that's where this movie failed completely. I give it a 6\/10, because not everything was awful, but it could have been a lot better.

I guess it's to warn humanity that time can be better spent, or so. Seriously, this movie is bad in a bad kind of way. There are movies which are so bad that they become good again due to the way in which they fail, but this is not one of them. This movie has 1. a storyline which is as elaborate and interesting as the manual for a teaspoon; 2. attempts at jokes, so miserably failed that they had to resort to downward embarrassing things like animal sex and splattering blood across a hospital room; 3. bad acting.I did laugh at about 3 points in the movie, but I think I laughed more in other movies which were supposed to be thrillers, while this is advertised as a 'comedy'. If the whole cast would have been vaporized by a nuclear explosion at the end, I would have laughed once more.My whole impression of the movie is that it's completely random. Randomness can be funny, but there still has to be some sense in the randomness, like in Monty Python movies. Here it's total randomness. The main person in this movie could be best described as a lunatic, and the movie depicts the acts of this lunatic. That's a better description than the plot outline or the title, which by the way only refers to something happening during about 5 minutes in the second half of the movie. The fact that it happens doesn't matter much, since the whole script is mostly random anyway.My advice only watch this stinker if you really, really are certain that you have nothing of marginal usefulness to do in your life. I guess the people who really like this, are people who would even see interesting patterns in the snowy noise of an unconnected TV set.Edit I have heard from other people that this movie was designed to be bad.

If you've read the book, I suggest you put it as far out of your mind as possible before watching the movie.Watchers is your typical Boy meets dog, dog turns out to be super-intelligent government lab experiment, dog and boy are pursued by super-intelligent and emotionally disturbed monster created by same lab, and, oh yeah, did I mention the shady government agents pursuing the monster pursuing the dog? movie.Corey Haim is the boy, Barbara Williams is his mother, Michael Ironside is one of the evil government guys, and Sandy the dog is, well, the dog (named Furface here; Einstein in the book).The monster effects are ridiculously cheesy, much of the dialogue is laughable, the script rarely makes sense or is believable - a good example is Haim's character's unquestioning acceptance of the dog's intelligence, as if every Fido off the street can type messages on a computer keyboard or bark once for yes and twice for no! Hmm, it's gotta be the puppy chow, right? Haim's performance is enthusiastic but shaky, as he carries off the stupid dialogue with the least amount of skill. Ironside has been the highlight of many a bad movie, and this is no exception. He easily gives the best performance of the movie, although I'm compelled to add that the dog (who's a pretty darn good actor himself!) comes in a close second.All in all, an atrociously dumb movie, and yet . . . And yet I watched it three times within a week. And yet I can't help liking it. Hey, what can I say, I have a taste for junk - and Michael Ironside (not that I've ever actually tasted Michael Ironside- I'm sure there are laws against that).

Not since Pulp Fiction have I ever been able to watch a movie and laugh at the jokes Every time I watch it. Yes, for those of you who haven't seen it, Snatch is very funny. Filled with very memorable characters, very creative direction and editing and top notch performances from everyone involved, Snatch is very easy to recommend and is a riot when watching it with friends (Who have very dark tastes.)

The fact it is so highly   revered by so many, and even considered profound, makes me fear for the   very existence of modern society.    There are some fundamental reasons I dislike this film with a passion,   the first being the pacing and substance, the film really mirrors it's   director to perfection, yapping and a mumblin and a stumblin from start   to finish, enthusiastically about....Nothing! If Qentin was not such an   untalented, cretinous buffoon I would call him the new David Lynch. The   only substance in PF is of the white powdery verity, the film is just a   collection of sick images splashed on screen willy nilly strung loosely   together by some sharp but pointless dialogue. The film was too crude,   made purely for shock value. When violence, male rape, drug abuse,   accidental shootings and other such fun filled things are packaged as   cool and even as comedy in the hands of an immature director you get a   highly irresponsible film, and to sell it as some sort of 'smart art'   piece is doubly irresponsible.    Then there is the complete lack of character development and depth.   There are no characters, only 2 dimensional machines created solely to   perform acts of severe violence and drop in a few wise cracks, they   perform actions in one scene that seem to have no effect or relation to   what happens in their next scene. Not one of them is even slightly   likable or in possession of any redeemable characteristics apart from   perhaps Butch (Willis), did I mention he is a violent thug, murderer   and a thief? Then there is Mia who seems to have little purpose in the   film other than an excuse to include the very uncomfortable scene where   an over weight Travolta boogies on the dance floor. Yes she is in the   'famous' needle scene as well, but what else? The section featuring   Vince and Mia was just dropped and barely mentioned again like Mia   herself, so what was the point? A question I asked of the film   throughout. I quickly realised that nobody in the film was there to be   developed, any one of them could have been dropped (apart from Butch)   or their actions performed by a completely new character without making   a spot of difference to the film, their actions were not to be the   subject of scrutiny. That would be asking too much of the Tarantino who   is clearly only interested in attempting to make stuff look cool. He is   the most unoriginal man on the planet only capable of tacky 'homage'   (ie, he is a thief) action films. Don't believe me? Watch Kill Bill   where he even pays homage to his own film, this one! I do give credit   to him in one respect. He realised that if he re-jigged the order of   plot events he could not only look artistically swish but he could   disguise the fact that the story is not worth the toilet paper it was   written on, impressing upon many the fallacy that the hack job   narrative structure enhanced the story.    The direction is experimental but quite frankly tacky and laughable at   times. One scene featuring a near comatose Butch in particular comes to   mind, the camera is stuck dead still on him while Marsellus (Rhames)   uses the m-f word 100 times in about 5 minutes, totally amateurish. The   only memorable performance is from Jackson, who could make the   ingredients list of a packet of cookies sound fun, he is offset by a   flat performance from Travolta. That brings me to the 'witty' dialogue   which, apart from the violence, is the crux of the piece. It is   unfortunate then, that this dialogue basically consists of idiots   talking a load of nonsense about such deep things as cheeseburgers,   milkshake, foot massages, cleaning up skull and brain chunks and some   coffee that is described as gourmet s**t. Some dialogue was witty but   mostly it was just utterly pointless, the characters deliver it with   such perceived style and coolness despite the fact they were talking   about, frankly, a lot of BS. Add this to the fact there is (barring   brief moments in Butch's story) no plot, no emotion and especially no   substance and you have one worthless film. Ah you don't get it they   all scream, don't make me laugh, the circular narrative and the   ham-fisted attempt at redemption at the end does not equal substance.   The ending was hilariously cheap, obviously a desperate attempt to   justify a pointless 2 hour string of images in one strike. Is it meant   to be profound? Well after sitting through the whole film which   consisted of characters that were never developed adequately, where no   actions or events were properly tackled, challenged or explored with   any great thought or depth during which I was never required to care   even once, I was presented with one of the most cheesy, pointless   monologues in film history. Oh and a parody of QT's fans - the   briefcase is opened and they stare at the shiny thing and go ooooh, it   beautiful. It is all a hollow gesture when you consider the character   that delivers the speech and his actions directly following it,   combined with the entire sequence of stupid events that precede it.   Many movies these days suffer similar problems at their conclusion   because of obvious limitations in plot structure and development, some   have endings that invalidate the rest of the film, others have endings   that are invalidated by the rest of the film, with Pulp Fiction QT has   somehow achieved both simultaneously.

If you want to know for sure Emmerich's opinion about his favorite film, pay attention to the Star Wars DVD Trilogy extras(1)).The first real success of the duo was Stargate, which is nothing but Flash Gordon with the Army around. An almost decent movie, not much expensive (by Hollywood standards) and with a script capable of solve the whole crisis in a hurry that would make George Lucas face turn red in envy. We arrive, we discover this Egyptian demigod (Ra!), we killed him and destroy his superior technology and his powerful pyramid-vessel, thanks for everything, next time will stay a bit longer. Pathetic (the TV series is terribly boring. Sorry).And then came the martians (whatever). And this, my friends, is your idea of a good spectacle. In that time was fun to see the White House blowing up in a zillion fragments, and your sympathetic army saving the entire world by destroying a whole technologically superior civilization (I'm sorry, not too advanced after all; 50 years and they use the same fighters-computers, as we see in the 51 area sequence), I repeat, an entire civilization (as the president reads in the mind of the martian, remember? They traveled all at once as friends, like the Indians in an old Spanish joke D) destroyed in 2 days, at time for the 4th of July. You know, here in Europe we laughed deeply at cinemas with the speech of the president. And cheered, too.And then came this Godzilla flick, which is, I'm sorry again, the best movie this German-americanized-in-more-than-one-way duo has ever made.I can remember that in that time, France was really doing nuclear tests in Moruroa (or was Mururoa?). This was the perfect starting point. Given the love this two, Devlin & Emmerich, feel for their land of adoption, USA couldn't at all be responsible for the needed nuclear explosion that, traditionally, unleashed the beast, oh, no. Not the only country who has ever used the bomb against civilian targets, making later the role of victims in The Day After.But ¿what the politics have to do with a movie like this?. Since ALL the cinema is politics, everything. And in this very case, the most. This is a film in the tradition which gave fame and fortune to Emmerich-Devlin an old idea modernized, for all audiences (meaning this you can save the dog but not the woman in certain situations, I suppose), a constant rip of classics (it was Lawrence of Arabia in Stargate), like the galactic trench run of the helicopters after the lizard in the middle of NY among other homages (not to mention Jurassic Park, another masterpiece) and with nerd-but-nice scientist and too-much-nice army men (not to forget the real heroes, the french secret service) who save the day and everything.At this point I want to call your attention to the other duo, with much more artistic sense than the first one, responsible of the script; I mean the Ted Elliot-Terry Rossio tandem, writers of some very good blockbuster movies like The Mask of Zorro, Aladdin, Pirates of the Caribbean - Episode I D and others. I bet my neck about the fact that, having in mind what the first team can do, the best ideas in this movie are the second's the french not only creating the monster (only an animal hungry for fish!) but in the end destroying it (while the army destroys the luckily evacuated city; luckily for the MPAA and the rating of the film), the origin of the name of the creature and the joke about the Americanization of the original name-film, from Gojira to Godzilla, and fortunately, the US army dying as idiots and destroying NY (is a right-wing classic topic to despise the media, so that's another very different thing, more to the likes of Emmerich-Devlin). About the fact that the french agent's names are Jean-Claude, Jean Patrick and Jean-Philippe, the bad news chief is Caiman and the good cameraman is Animal, I can't possibly imagine who had the idea.The real thing is that the French save the world, man.

It is not the idea of making a big blockbuster out of the great old 1960s TV show The Wild Wild West, an idea which can, at best, be described as tiresomely uninspired. Nor is there brilliance in transforming the image of the lead character just so that they could build the role around star-of-the-moment Will Smith. But out of that horribly perverse example of Hollywood commercial packaging there is an intriguing premise, which naturally seems to have slipped past all involved without a second glance. What if the best, brightest and most intrepid government agent working in post-Civil War America was, indeed, a black man? Realistically, how would an African-American, functioning in a repressive, racist society, where even the most liberal thinker would see him as a second-class citizen, indeed, a second class human being, be able to not only outsmart the bad guys, but to impress even the skeptical good guys? It is an intriguing idea because, on the one hand, such an agent would not be suspected of being a threat and, on the other hand, he would have to overcome so many more barriers than a white man would ever face. He would be both invisible and yet stand out like the proverbial sore thumb just about anywhere he went. He'd be constantly fighting two battles. Such a film could be thrilling and funny, yet something rare original.The Wild Wild West TV show itself was all those things it was highly derivative of both the traditional western and the then-fresh James Bond-style spy movie -- with more than a little bit of Batman-style comic book campiness kicked in -- yet it was ingenious in the way it melded those mythic genres into a one-of-a-kind series. There was never anything quite like The Wild Wild West and never anything since -- including this disastrous 1997 movie.Everything about WILD WILD WEST, the movie, is just plain bad tacky special effects; clumsy direction; an embarrassing screenplay; plus a fine, bewildered cast wasted in totally unworkable roles. But as bad as everything else is, the base rot of WWW goes directly to its reworked premise. No matter how open minded one might be, or how much one prides oneself on being socially color blind, there is just no way to honestly accept replacing Robert Conrad, TV's James West, with Will Smith. The time and the place dictate that James West be a white male -- unless, the filmmakers acknowledge and embrace the incongruity and use it for a real purpose.Yet, the filmmakers want it both ways the audience is expected to be able to ignore Smith's skin color, while at the same time the entire plot is based on his confrontation with a white racist trying to reestablish Confederate power and seize control of the U.S. government. How can you respect or believe in a film or filmmakers that get all preachy about the evils of racism while all along dealing with the issue with absolutely no respect for historical honesty? It is not clear if having Smith play James West as a cocky, street smart, John Shaft-style character was intended to be a joke, social commentary or just absurd politically correct pandering to black audiences, but it is clear that it does not work. The most outrageously unbelievable thing about WILD WILD WEST is not the wildly improbable sci-fi inventions but that the Smith character actually makes it to the end of the film without being lynched. It's not that the anachronism of a cocksure 20th century black man confronting 19th century bigotry isn't workable, because that very time-warp racial comedy had already been done with much greater success in the Mel Brooks classic, BLAZING SADDLES. Unlike WWW, Brooks and company realized the sheer idiocy of the premise, yet used that to mock both the black and the white stereotypes with equal glee.Where BLAZING SADDLES is an honest farce, WILD WILD WEST is dishonest and cowardly. All involved probably thought they were being pretty daring by flaunting convention and hiring Smith, but they did not hire Will Smith the African American, they hired Will Smith the action hero movie star. They built WILD WILD WEST around Smith's race, but only to exploit his contemporary Hollywood image, even to the point of letting him create and perform a totally inappropriate (and totally bad) rap song at the end. You can sense the film exploiting both Smith's star image and his race, while not wishing to risk challenging either. The film tries to reinvent The Wild Wild West TV show, but the changes are literally skin deep. To really explore and compare racism in America by blending the attitudes of two different American centuries would have been too wild wild of an idea for these timid timid filmmakers.
