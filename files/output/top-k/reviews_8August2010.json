Not only that but in the particular case of this movie (episode), we have reached half way in the story, with the first act of the saga completed in the earlier episode (Revenge of the Sith), giving this movie the job of linking the two trilogies together. So as one might expect we get back in first gear again, with the story unfolding very slowly again.Some twenty (more or less) years later after the events that toke place in Revenge of the Sith, the empire is already established, the senate hanging on a thread, and with the Jedi almost extinct nothing is between the emperor and his grip on the universe, except for a few rebels. The movie opens with a ship carrying princess Leya, a rebel ambassador, fleeing from an imperial cruiser.Lucas has told many times that he chose to tell this movie and its story from the point of view of the two bickering droids, R2D2 and C-3PO. For as amusing as it is (they really stand out as a kind of odd couple), this really makes the first half of the movie very slow. Inspired from Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress, these slow beginnings where seldom in the Japanese director's movies, but then again you got rewarded in the end, as Kurosawa made self contained movies and no sequels, hence the drawback in Lucas choice. Before George Lucas directed the later trilogy it was understandable, as there was the need for introducing characters. Not anymore!

Perhaps one of the few unexpected consequences of the recently produced trilogy and prequels.However, once we get to the second half of this episode things start to get moving! The escape from the Death Star helps you to sink in with the real nature of Episode IV, an adventure movie more than anything else, not really worried with developing the true motif and backbone of this saga which revolves around the Skywalker family. From there on, including that final assault on the Death star (very nicely done by the way!!), going through it all with the land mark score by John Williams (which is indefinitely part of the story's identity), we are definitely in gear accepting the new characters and their roles in the saga, as well as going back to our empathy for the old ones (Obi Wan and such). And of course, by this time the prequels have helped to emphasize our wish to see the Skywalker novella unfold. So when the credits come on the screen you are already reaching for the Empire strikes back DVD.To conclude my review, if you want to see a self contained movie, you are in for a fair adventure movie, but the real prize will get past you if you haven't seen the prequels or don't intent to see the sequels. So don't waste time. By the whole lot and see the full six episodes! It's a unique cinematic experience.

Certainly deserved the multiple Oscar achievement awards it received. It may be overlooked under the tag of being a WWII propaganda film. Mrs. Miniver of 1943 does deliver a poignant war-related story, with an exceptional ensemble cast (including the two young children Minivers) and subtly masterful direction by William Wyler.The script of four writers somehow managed to include many aspects of wartime family trials and tribulations, young men and older ones fighting for their country, women's role and family members young and old, rich, poor or middle-class, how they cope with their daily living. Amidst all, humor is not forgotten and the atmosphere the family scenes or common-folk (premise being in the early '40s in rural England, we have the station master, butcher, milkman, housemaid, tavern owner) encounters generate are congenial and touching. The central Miniver family is well-represented father, mother, young daughter and son with a pet cat, and a grown-up son from Oxford. Best supporting actress, Teresa Wright's performance is truly one to watch, everything told from her face with the varying expressions keenly matching her co-stars Richard Ney (Vin), Greer Garson (Vin's mother), Dame May Witty (her aunt Lady Beldon). Especially when her character Carol Beldon's relationship with Vin Miniver, scholar turned RAF airman, took an unexpected turn. It may seem dramatic, but stepping back, in wartime, anything can happen without warning and such reality holds true still for today.The set design (by Edwin Willis), photography (by Joseph Ruttenberg), and editing (by Harold Kress), including music (by Herbert Stothart) applied, are all integral with attention to details. I see the swans between Garson and Henry Travers' Mr. Ballard during their impromptu morning chat with the lake behind them (before a suspenseful sequence to follow). The collapsed dining room scene first we see father, son and daughter standing there, camera pulls back and we see their backs from behind what they are facing the dismal room in ruins (impact of air-raid silent but loud). The pastor talking to his parish community - the beginning and the end scenes contrasting each other. The siren shelter space with the individual first-aid boxes marked with respective family member names, a certain telling sadness prevails.

Since I figured that this was unfair and nobody should review a movie without watching it entirely, I forced myself to watch it. Oh boy. First, a summary of my old first reviewBattlefield Earth was on TV together with another movie that I wanted to watch. The description for both movies looked interesting, but after zapping regularly between the two, it seemed that BE was just horrible. Every time I switched back from the other movie, it was as if nothing had happened. All the scenes looked the same, the action scenes were bad, the dialogue was horrible, and for some reason the movie almost made me feel nauseous. It was like having those typical nightmares I often have when I have a fever, where everything repeats endlessly. So, eventually I stopped switching channels and watched the other movie.Now, after having seen it in its entirety, I'm feeling relieved that the rating I originally gave was fully deserved. I rarely give a minimum score, but BE is a perfect example of rare awfulness it gets a solid one.The whole thing is just directed and produced horribly. Let me put this straight the story on itself is preposterous &#x97; I'll come back to this later on. Yet, even a stupid story can make a thrilling movie, but Battlefield Earth is not an example of this. The action scenes are all awful it's often impossible to see what happens. The film is full of slow-motion shots, but they are used at all the wrong moments. One would expect that close-ups and slow-motion would be used to focus on the action, but not here the camera often seems to shy away from the actual action. Judging from the poor special effects that can sometimes be seen when the camera does show some action, they probably just avoided using SFX altogether. The pacing is also completely off scenes just drag along, and are then followed by a pile-up of action. Some transitions are so abrupt that it seems like large parts were left on the cutting table, but even those parts that survived are all poorly directed. Most of the film is tinted in an exaggerated blue hue, which makes all those scenes look like the same scene all over again. The entire movie feels like an episode of a bad sci-fi TV show from around 1990, stretched to almost two hours.Funny enough, I found a perfect explanation as to why Battlefield Earth made me nauseous the first time I watched it. There is almost NO scene in the ENTIRE movie where the camera is NOT tilted. Really, what were they thinking? It may look cool when used now and then, but it's just ridiculous if *every* shot is tilted at a random angle. Sometimes subsequent shot changes will make the image tilt from left to right and vice versa, so it is entirely possible that watching this film will induce seasickness. This is not the only thing about the camera-work that is awful there is an overuse of close-ups, and often half of an actor's face is cut off (partially due to the tilting). Sometimes we also get close-ups of random objects as if they are of great significance, but they aren't.The acting is bad, not abysmally bad but bad enough not to be able to compensate for the rest of the awfulness. Travolta does a decent job but fails to drag this film out of the abyss.The special effects probably looked OK back in 2000, except for the 'blaster' shots which would only have managed to awe an audience in 1980. But even the other effects look very dated now, it's hard to believe that movies like The Matrix are even older than Battlefield Earth. There is an obvious reference to the 'falling through glass' scene from Blade Runner at the start of the movie, but it is filmed so poorly that it was more like an insult to BR than a homage.Now, by far the worst thing about this movie is its plot. It's not just full of gaping holes, even with all the holes patched it still is an insult to viewers. Battlefield Earth is rated PG-13 but ironically enough, the only people who might appreciate it would be at most twelve years old because they might still be able to muster enough suspension of disbelief. The first two thirds of the film are not entirely ridiculous, and could have been saved by an awesome ending. However, the actual ending was ten times worse than the most preposterous thing I have ever seen in any other movie. Even the nuking the fridge scene from Indiana Jones 4 seemed plausible in comparison. Even though I rate Battlefield Earth a 1, meaning never ever watch this, I would still recommend watching it if you want to see amazing stupidness. Mind that the rest of the movie will make you hurl, but if you enjoy laughing at ridiculousness that wants to take itself seriously, it could be worth it.The only thing that is remotely OK is the musical score, but only when considered on its own. Some scenes where nothing of much importance happens are accompanied by music that would be appropriate during a frantic fighting scene. By the time the actual fighting begins, the music fails to add any tension no matter how thrilling it is.Overall, Battlefield Earth is a complete failure, and it deserves to be in the Bottom 100.

He has spent 30 years in isolation on account of secrets he knows and skills he possesses. He has even successfully escaped from Alcatraz...something that general knowledge states could not be done. After all of this, the ones who have screwed him around turn out to be the ones who need him most when the island is taken over by dis-gruntled soldiers and a past General of the Viet Nam war who have taken 81 hostages. Nick Cage is called in as a chem-weapons expert. He knows that field, but knows little else, as he has never seen combat, and it has been years since he had any weapons training. There's no problem for an audience to adjust their radar to see Connery in a cloak and dagger situation...and one that has high energy. But...with Nick Cage..he seems to be cast some what over his head and out of his element. There is some measure of a modern day Horatio Alger character to his performance, but to my view the film could have been made without him, or his role could have been reduced. He actually bogs things down because he needs to be rescued a bit too often. And Cage is not the only problem with this film. The twists and turns of this plot defy reality at some points. There are a few entertaining and exciting moments in the film, but these are outweighed by the gaps in credibility of the plot and of some of the characters, especially the General who changes co-ordinates on a weapon of destruction, and claims he was only bluffing, and tries to call off the whole incident. Of course, the people that he has recruited are PO'd to a fare-thee-well. But, plot dysfunctions such as this take the steam out of the sails of the film, and it's hard to take the film seriously. That would be enough to chase off the critical thinkers, but not enough to turn off the thrill-seekers who want to be entertained...and that's probably the only reason this piece of celluloid has any legs at all. Because the film has mostly entertainment value of a destructive sort and does not seek to engage the audience, it fails to deliver. I have given it 5 stars, which I consider to be quite generous.

Rank and file staples come thick and fast; boo jump moments, characters refusing to accept the un-normal, silly kids, silly coppers, a potential hero and heroine, possible romance, some sci-fi babble, a curse, and of course the creature itself; a big hybrid of god knows what! But the Kothoga is a snarling, slimy monstrosity that goes about the museum lopping heads off inept human beings with carefree abandon. What's not to like there?.Tho Hyams is no genius director, he is, as his CV suggests, more than capable at crafting a polished movie. Such is the case here. Where the B movie story is given good technical treatment. The lighting and editing serve the atmosphere well, while the sound work is of the required horror requisitional standard. More importantly, tho, Hyams is aware of building up the tension by not unleashing the creature too soon. We know it's the killer, and we get little snippets of it here and there, but it's not until all hell breaks loose at the big museum event that we see the monster, and it's not a let down. Part animatronic\/part computer effect, the Kothoga is original and it is great fun. So much so it (thankfully) steers the viewers away from the pedestrian performances of the cast. Not bad exactly, but just doing grizzled and spunky beauty (Sizemore & Miller respectively) doesn't grab the attention. The best actor on show is Whitmore (tracing a lovely creature feature line from Them! in 1954 to here), but he is badly under written and under used.Still, the minor acting issues matters not, for this is ready made for a Saturday night in with the beer and some snacks. Give it a go and you may just enjoy yourself. 7\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"8 August 2010","score":"","review":" Film adaptations of true events will inevitably get slammed from some quarters. In the case of Dog Day Afternoon it was attacked by its own lead subject John Wojtowicz (renamed Sonny Wortzik for the screen), who described it as only 30% accurate. His gripes were mainly about portrayals of secondary characters such as his mother and first wife, as well as his belief that the film implies he sold out Sal &#x96; which it doesn't. But such is the nature of cinema &#x96; reality is a myriad of single events from a myriad of perspectives, without explicit beginnings, endings or crescendos. A movie, on the other hand, must tell a story.And movies have to take a form. Dog Day Afternoon, oddly enough, often takes the form of a comedy. Whether this comes more from Frank Pierson's script or the many improvisations made during rehearsal I don't know, but either way it seems to originate from very absurdity of the situation. Although it's based on true events, it's like a what if? sketch. What if a naïve and essentially nice guy tries to pull off a bank robbery? You get situations like the robber asking the hostages if they need the bathroom. And of course, as any Charlie Chaplin fan knows, a comedy basis makes serious scenes even more poignant.This is why Al Pacino's performance is so vital. Far more animated than he was in the Godfather movies, he displays both a knack for comic timing, deepened by the touching simplicity of his character. John Cazale too is almost childlike, speaking tough but acting timid, and this is by far the best of his half-dozen film roles. Chris Sarandon gives a sublimely naturalistic performance, for what is definitely a difficult part to get right. Penelope Allen is also excellent, full of the gutsy personality that makes her the key to the fraternization between the robbers and the hostages. Above all it's the sheer likability of these players as they present themselves here that enables us to laugh, cry, and be enthralled by their antics.Dog Day Afternoon is at least faithful enough to real events that it mixes the public with the personal. After all, the real Sonny was not just some money-hungry hoodlum, and it was essential to balance the FBI operation and the media circus with the character's background and humanity. Who better to handle this balance than director Sidney Lumet. Lumet was already something of a specialist in movies confined to single locations (12 Angry Men, Murder on the Orient Express), and the way he approached these problems was to create different kinds of space within the limitations of the set. In Dog Day Afternoon we have everything from the grand scale outdoor shots, to simple group mid-shots, to the intimacy of the close-up. But there is far more variation going on here than simply how far the camera is from the action. There are, for example, close-ups which don't feel entirely private, with other characters seen in the background, and those which are totally personal, against plain backgrounds with no movement other than that of the actors being focused on. Even in some of the outdoor shots Lumet sometimes arranges things so that those thronging crowds are cut out of the shot. The greatest moment of genius is perhaps the conversation between Pacino and Sarandon. It begins with Sarandon amid loads of cops, and he is awkward and stilted. However as he eases up and the conversation becomes more personal, so too does the space around Sarandon. Sarandon has not gained privacy, but he has forgotten that he doesn't have it.On a purely cinematic level, Dog Day Afternoon is a masterpiece. And yes, some small details had to be changed to make it that good a piece of storytelling. It is not a documentary. And as such a great work, the film has been loved by millions. We come away from it with the feeling that Sonny and his associates were misfits rather than villains, good in their intentions if misguided in their actions, and that the events of that day were a kind of social tragedy.

Originally, director Ted Kotcheff's First Blood depicted the trials and tribulations that a former Green Beret encounters when he came home from Vietnam and clashes with an obnoxious, hard-headed sheriff. First Blood was derived from author David Morrell's cult novel. Eventually, after a high body count, John J. Rambo surrenders to the authorities. Whereas First Blood emerged as largely tragic, Rambo First Blood, Part 2 is primarily heroic. The film generated some controversy during its release with its contentious subject matter about surviving American P.O.W.s left behind in Vietnam. Surprisingly, Rambo First Blood, Part 2 did not create the 'free the American P.O.W.s. Ironically, the film that did create this niche genre was Kotcheff's Uncommon Value that came out two years before Rambo First Blood, Part 2. Nevertheless, this sequel attracted more attention. Moreover, this sequel is a lot more charismatic because the James Cameron & Sylvester Stallone screenplay deals mostly in black and white with fewer gray areas of subtlety. Remember, this is a formulaic actioneer with titanic archetypal characters competing against each other. This time Rambo is the white-all-over good guy protagonist battling overwhelming odds amid fantastic looking scenery. He wields his trusty knife as well as throwing blades, RPGs, explosive-tipped arrows, and a helicopter. One scene sums up Rambo's ideas about weaponry. He states I thought the mind was the best weapon. The villains are appropriately treacherous and savage, especially British actor Steven Berkoff as the sadistic Soviet colonel who tortures our hero and George Cheung as the North Vietnamese officer who kills the heroine. As Rambo First Blood, Part 2 opens, Rambo is shown in prison. At least, he assures his visitor and mentor Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna of Catlow) that he knows where he stands behind bars. Colonel Trautman makes him a proposition that will get him out of stir and back into the real world. After Rambo returns to Southeast Asia for the mission, he doesn't like the head honcho, Marshall Murdock (square-jawed Charles Napier of Beyond the Valley of the Dolls), because he doesn't trust him. Murdock claims that he served in Vietnam, but Rambo remembers Murdock's outfit being stationed somewhere else than where Murdock said. Before Rambo boards the jet that will take him to his destination, he informs Trautman that he is the only one whom he trusts. Afterwards, things go downhill rapidly. Rambo lugs an arsenal of sophisticated weapons aboard the jet. When he bails out, his parachute cord snags on the fuselage and jeopardizes his life. Consequently, our hero must resort to his razor-sharp knife to slash his way free of the plane. Of course, Rambo sacrifices that valuable, state-of-the-art arsenal, so he can survive and carry out the mission. Remember, he was instructed only to take photographs of the P.O.W.s. Incidentally, a similar plot complication occurred earlier in director Ted Kotcheff's rescue-the-P.O.W.s-from Vietnam movie Uncommon Valor (1983) with Gene Hackman. The heroes lost their arsenal and had to improvise. At this point, Murdock wants to abort the mission, but Trautman won't let him. Meanwhile, Rambo makes his rendezvous after a little jaunt through the jungle and a brief encounter with a snake hanging from a tree. Rambo meets up with Co Bao (Julia Nickson of Glitch!) and she takes him to a river where pirates working for pay ferry them upriver. Since Rambo has lost his equipment, he cannot carry out his mission of photographing the P.O.W.s. Obstinately, Rambo slips into the camp and cuts loose one P.O.W. hanging from a rack. Our muscular protagonist hauls the P.O.W. off to the extraction point. Initially, Murdock is against flying in to retrieve Rambo, but Trautman puts up enough flak to convince him to go ahead with the flight. What happens next surprises not only Trautman but also Rambo. Murdock aborts the pick-up as Rambo and the P.O.W. stand on a hillside surrounded with Vietnamese soldiers. Predictably, Trautman is furious. The Vietnamese call in the Russians to interrogate Rambo, Lieutenant Colonel Podovsky (Steven Berkoff of Octopussy) who confines our hero to a massive set of bed springs and fries him repeatedly with jolts of electricity. To make this scene and its torture more visually palatable for audiences, Cosmatos uses the venerable prison movie tactic of showing the lights dim with each successive jolt of electricity. Podovsky wants Rambo to confess his crimes, but Rambo has other ideas. Meanwhile, Co Bao infiltrates the prison camp posing as a prostitute. Earlier, before Rambo and Co Bao sneaked into the camp, they saw a prostitute on a motor scooter enter the camp, so she uses this as her cover to get inside the barbed wire and rescue Rambo. Rambo warns Murdock that he is coming after him and escapes with Co Bao. Jerry Goldsmith's orchestral score puts sizzle into the action. Exorcist sound effects editor Fred J. Brown received an Oscar nomination for Best Sound Effects Editing for Rambo First Blood, Part 2. Director George P. Cosmatos doesn't waste a second in this trim 94-minute exercise in larger-than-life violence, while Conan the Destroyer lenser Jack Cardiff captures all the gritty, muddy, visceral action with his widescreen cameras. Rambo First Blood, Part 2 features many iconic scenes for this type of movie. The helicopter attack on the prisoner-of-war camp is an exciting, adrenalin-laced sequence with multiple cameras covering the action as our hero strafes the camp and blows up guards. Later, Rambo's helicopter squares off with the chief adversary who flies an imposing helicopter. The most incredible scene, however, in Rambo First Blood, Part 2 is the scene aboard a river ferry where our battle-scarred hero kisses an Asian girl.

Remember, this is a formulaic actioneer with titanic archetypal characters competing against each other. This time Rambo is the white-all-over good guy protagonist battling overwhelming odds amid fantastic looking scenery. He wields his trusty knife as well as throwing blades, RPGs, explosive-tipped arrows, and a helicopter. One scene sums up Rambo's ideas about weaponry. He states I thought the mind was the best weapon. The villains are appropriately treacherous and savage, especially British actor Steven Berkoff as the sadistic Soviet colonel who tortures our hero and George Cheung as the North Vietnamese officer who kills the heroine. As Rambo First Blood, Part 2 opens, Rambo is shown in prison. At least, he assures his visitor and mentor Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna of Catlow) that he knows where he stands behind bars. Colonel Trautman makes him a proposition that will get him out of stir and back into the real world. After Rambo returns to Southeast Asia for the mission, he doesn't like the head honcho, Marshall Murdock (square-jawed Charles Napier of Beyond the Valley of the Dolls), because he doesn't trust him. Murdock claims that he served in Vietnam, but Rambo remembers Murdock's outfit being stationed somewhere else than where Murdock said. Before Rambo boards the jet that will take him to his destination, he informs Trautman that he is the only one whom he trusts. Afterwards, things go downhill rapidly. Rambo lugs an arsenal of sophisticated weapons aboard the jet. When he bails out, his parachute cord snags on the fuselage and jeopardizes his life. Consequently, our hero must resort to his razor-sharp knife to slash his way free of the plane. Of course, Rambo sacrifices that valuable, state-of-the-art arsenal, so he can survive and carry out the mission. Remember, he was instructed only to take photographs of the P.O.W.s. Incidentally, a similar plot complication occurred earlier in director Ted Kotcheff's rescue-the-P.O.W.s-from Vietnam movie Uncommon Valor (1983) with Gene Hackman. The heroes lost their arsenal and had to improvise. At this point, Murdock wants to abort the mission, but Trautman won't let him. Meanwhile, Rambo makes his rendezvous after a little jaunt through the jungle and a brief encounter with a snake hanging from a tree. Rambo meets up with Co Bao (Julia Nickson of Glitch!) and she takes him to a river where pirates working for pay ferry them upriver. Since Rambo has lost his equipment, he cannot carry out his mission of photographing the P.O.W.s. Obstinately, Rambo slips into the camp and cuts loose one P.O.W. hanging from a rack. Our muscular protagonist hauls the P.O.W. off to the extraction point. Initially, Murdock is against flying in to retrieve Rambo, but Trautman puts up enough flak to convince him to go ahead with the flight. What happens next surprises not only Trautman but also Rambo. Murdock aborts the pick-up as Rambo and the P.O.W. stand on a hillside surrounded with Vietnamese soldiers. Predictably, Trautman is furious. The Vietnamese call in the Russians to interrogate Rambo, Lieutenant Colonel Podovsky (Steven Berkoff of Octopussy) who confines our hero to a massive set of bed springs and fries him repeatedly with jolts of electricity. To make this scene and its torture more visually palatable for audiences, Cosmatos uses the venerable prison movie tactic of showing the lights dim with each successive jolt of electricity. Podovsky wants Rambo to confess his crimes, but Rambo has other ideas. Meanwhile, Co Bao infiltrates the prison camp posing as a prostitute. Earlier, before Rambo and Co Bao sneaked into the camp, they saw a prostitute on a motor scooter enter the camp, so she uses this as her cover to get inside the barbed wire and rescue Rambo. Rambo warns Murdock that he is coming after him and escapes with Co Bao. Jerry Goldsmith's orchestral score puts sizzle into the action. Exorcist sound effects editor Fred J. Brown received an Oscar nomination for Best Sound Effects Editing for Rambo First Blood, Part 2. Director George P. Cosmatos doesn't waste a second in this trim 94-minute exercise in larger-than-life violence, while Conan the Destroyer lenser Jack Cardiff captures all the gritty, muddy, visceral action with his widescreen cameras. Rambo First Blood, Part 2 features many iconic scenes for this type of movie. The helicopter attack on the prisoner-of-war camp is an exciting, adrenalin-laced sequence with multiple cameras covering the action as our hero strafes the camp and blows up guards. Later, Rambo's helicopter squares off with the chief adversary who flies an imposing helicopter. The most incredible scene, however, in Rambo First Blood, Part 2 is the scene aboard a river ferry where our battle-scarred hero kisses an Asian girl. Rambo never locked lips with anybody in either First Blood or any of the other Rambo sequels.

Yet, I wouldn't be doing the movie justice because it's not all about comedy, but heart, drama and growing.A lot of movies try hard, they really do try their best to blend comedy and human drama and come up with the same conclusion when water meets oil. Director Shadyac picked the perfect crew, writer and actors to make us truly believe the heartbreak these characters go through.Immediately labeled as a liar or lawyer, as teacher corrects student Max Reede (Cooper,) attorney (and Max's father) Fletcher Reede (Carrey) is close to the top of his firm and inching closer. Unfortunately for him, he's sacrificing the love he truly has for his son, whom he shares joint custody with his ex, Audrey (Tierney.) He doesn't just sacrifice, he's abolishing all hopes and dreams of the little one, even when Max, nor, oddly his mother, give up on him. In the main premise scene of the movie, Max make a birthday wish that for one day, Fletcher cannot tell a lie, strangely enough, the day starts at 815 PM.Unfortunately, Fletcher has the biggest and Make-Partner case of his life defending Samantha Cole (Poker Goddess Jennifer Tilly with unusually short and blonde hair) when everyone knows she's slimy\/guilty\/slutty and the only way to get her just rewards in her own divorce case is for Fletcher to lie.He needs a work around, when it's finally clear to him (THE PEN IS BLUE!) he cannot even fib. Serious comedy ensues when he juggles his anti-deception (apparently in any form), his son who might be leaving 3,000 miles with mom and new fiancé, the case, his boss & boss's boss and actually taking to heart what this really means.A la Groundhog Day. Which, by the way, ranks slightly over this movie, but both are under the same fantasy realm in which a character must embark on unusual circumstances to, well, learn a lesson.I hate to downgrade the movie to Okay, fine, you have to like Jim Carrey to like this. I understand the world's divided with Carrey lovers\/haters, Adam Sandler haters\/lovers, etc, but I have spoken to multiple people that don't care for Carrey and still love this movie.I'm thinking it has to do with the excellent acting all around, the deep humor and characters and also the heart that went into the story.If you've seen the recent Toy Story 3, and you see that little girl in the finale sad she couldn't get the toy&#x85;well, that's a cartoon (and well done, I might add.) I truly felt Max's heart shatter when his father lies to him or lets him down. At the same time, I honestly felt he never gave up, even though it was absolutely knocking him down. Simultaneously, I felt Fletcher grow and show true love for his son. You don't get these two characters in half the Dramas that come out.And this is labeled as a comedy. It's freaking hilarious from moment one to Carrey actually making fun of his own career, concerning funny faces, to the outrageous finale that if you feel like you don't believe that could happen &#x96; remind yourself the movie's based on a birthday wish that actually comes true.Make sure you watch the deleted scenes, including the outtakes in the closing credits.

I myself have veered between loving this movie to then hating it to now enjoying all of the set-pieces despite the fact that they're framed by one of Hitchcock's weaker films.The script is okay and the direction, as you would expect, is great but this film falters thanks to the characters that are hard to care about played by people who can't really do anything good with their roles. Tippi Hedren managed to redeem herself in her next Hitchcock movie but here is almost laughably bad in places. In fact, she only ever shows changes in her character thanks to the styling of her hair and the widening or narrowing of her eyes. Rod Taylor isn't bad but isn't great either. Jessica Tandy purses her lips and plays her character quirks out far too overtly.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"8 August 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Alfred Hitchcock is my favourite director, and I love a vast majority of his films particularly Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, Rebecca, The Lady Vanishes, Strangers on a Train, Shadow of a Doubt, North By Northwest, Dial M For Murder and 39 Steps. Notorious for many reasons is one of my favourite films from the Master of Suspense. The cinematography, locations and costumes are ravishing, I loved that stunning crane shot swooping towards the key in Bergman's hand, while the score is beautiful, romantic and melodious. The script itself is like poetry, Hitchcock's direction is superb with some very nice deft touches and the story is engaging with the suspense unfolding in a more subtle way than with North By Northwest or Vertigo. And the acting is wonderful. Cary Grant is charming and urbane not to mention ice-cold in character, while Ingrid Bergman is alluring and vulnerable and their chemistry is note-perfect. They are almost out-shadowed by the outstanding supporting performance of Claude Rains, who was one of the best supporting actors of his time with one of the most memorable voices; he plays a truly treacherous character yet also gives him a sense of humanity. Parts of Notorious may be slow, but to me it is never boring. It is not thematically complex, but it is dark and romantic and is truly polished entertainment too. In conclusion, another favourite Hitchcock of mine, and I personally think it is a must-watch for any fans of the director. 10\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"8 August 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Alfred Hitchcock is my favourite director, and I love a vast majority of his films particularly Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, Rebecca, The Lady Vanishes, Strangers on a Train, Shadow of a Doubt, North By Northwest, Dial M For Murder and 39 Steps.

The whole movie is heavily steeped in an atmosphere which is bleak and fatalistic and the action takes place in an environment which looks perpetually dark and threatening.The look of the movie is attributable to the fine work of cinematographer John Alton whose single source lighting and heavily shadowed interiors create a claustrophobic ambiance which is symbolic of the extremely limited amount of freedom which can be enjoyed by the story's central character and his two travelling companions as they try to evade a massive police dragnet. The use of interesting camera angles, deep focus photography and swirling areas of fog also contribute strongly to the generally unsettling and rather ominous mood of the piece.Whilst serving a prison sentence for a crime he didn't commit, Joe Sullivan (Dennis O'Keefe) is visited by two women. Ann Martin (Marsha Hunt) is a legal assistant who tells him that with good behaviour he could possibly get released in 2 or 3 years time and his girlfriend Pat Regan (Claire Trevor) informs him that arrangements have been made for him to escape. The escape plan had been devised by gang boss Rick Coyle (Raymond Burr) who owes Joe $50,000 from a crime that they'd previously carried out together. Rick has calculated that Joe's chances of surviving an attempted breakout are minute and so confidently expects to be able to avoid having to part with Joe's money.Joe escapes and Pat drives the getaway car but they soon have to abandon the vehicle because of a large number of bullet holes in the fuel tank. They then go on to Ann's apartment where they kidnap her and use her car to continue their journey to meet Rick and collect Joe's money before heading for freedom in South America. This unusual threesome successfully evades the police and an attack by one of Rick's henchmen before Joe and Rick finally meet and a violent confrontation follows.Joe's resourcefulness enabled him to successfully negotiate the perils of being on the run but he was also preoccupied by the complications which developed in relation to his feelings for Pat and Ann. Pat was loyal and totally supportive but was also very much a part of the difficult lifestyle that he'd always known. When Ann and he became attracted to each other, she seemed to embody the possibility of a different and better life in the future. This situation led to some tensions as Pat became jealous and eventually resigned to Joe ending up in Ann's arms.Dennis O'Keefe and Marsha Hunt are both very good in their roles and Claire Trevor poignantly portrays the profound emotional pain suffered by Pat as she realises that Joe has never told her that he loves her and then also sees him steadily becoming more and more attracted to Ann. Raymond Burr is outstanding as Rick who is a vile and sadistic psychopath with a penchant for pyromania.The score by Paul Sawtell features the spooky sound of a theremin and this together with the tone of Claire Trevor's narration brilliantly reinforces the grim atmosphere of this film which doesn't end well for any of the main characters. Appropriately, from the visual standpoint, this movie is probably one of the blackest ever made.

The special effects were by Arnold Gillespie, and to this day the horse of a different color that switches from purple to red to yellow is an inspiration to young audiences. For a film shot on MGM sound stages, the picture has amazing depth, and this is thanks to George Gibson's painted backdrops with blue mountains and white peaks that evoked the aura of the Emerald City.This is pure escapism and Dorothy (Judy Garland) literally escapes from Kansas to take her journey to see the Wizard. In the journey she meets a few friends. These friends are the Wizard of Oz played by Frank Morgan, the Scarecrow played by Ray Bolger, the Cowardly lion played by Bert Lehr, the tin man played by Jack Haley, and the princess played by Billie Burke. Everyone could always enjoy a nice story that takes them on a crazy ride through fantasy world and then snaps back to the real world at the end. The appeal of the film may have something to do with the fact that it symbolizes Dorothy's last childhood experience and it is her loss of innocence that is portrayed. At the end of the movie, Dorothy returns to Kansas, back to her old life with her family. Dorothy wore a corset-like dress to make sure that her filling-out figure was not revealed this made the look of an eleven-year old is preserved. The film ends with the moral that there is no place like home, no matter how exotic and fantastic. Far from being depressing and anti-fantasy, the film encourages young people to be creative with their minds. There is no reason that Bert Lahrs Zeke cannot be transformed into The Cowardly Lion though creative day-dreaming. I know when I saw it as a small child I liked to day dream and try to go to the Land of Oz myself. From then on out as a child if I were having a bad day I would just lay in bed and try to go away. It was very relaxing to try and use my imagination to visit the tin man, the lion, the scarecrow and the Wizard.
