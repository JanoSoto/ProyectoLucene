What I don't get is why are the Backstreet Boys in the clip? Oh yeah, their song was pretty cool too. I didn't think it was them, but when we got to the credits and we stopped to read the ones for the songs I was like Oh, my god, is that the Backstreet Boys? which was kind of cool cos I haven't listened to their stuff for a while.

I found it hilarious with great eye candy, a real treat to watch. Think of it as a 90s kaleidescope of various traditions, cliches, and conventions, in a silly framework of America's favorite medium, science fiction. In essence, it's an intentional b-movie of the 90s.First of all, 90% of this movie is a reference\/spoof\/homage to *something*, either in pop culture or science fiction. Many of the devices are drawn from not only B sci-fi of it's decade, but also heavily from 50s-70s sci-fi short stories, of which I happen to be a huge fan. For example, the little robots cleaning up the mess is almost perfectly as described by Ray Bradbury, and even Zorg's speech (slightly modified) in that scene is drawn from a mid-60s Hugo winner, by an author whose name escapes me.The culture references are equally engaging. I love the Thai ship, McDonalds, Ruby Rod, etc. Several of them are double references, also. Some day I'm going to sit down and make a complete list of every reference in the script and film... then again, I'll prolly never have that much time on my hands.There is alot of quite intentional campiness. Think about this for a moment if they could do the visuals for so many of the great-looking scenes, why do the Mangalores looked so stupid? I think it's hilarious how sleek everything is, but the Mangalores look like something out of an old Star Trek episode. Zorg embodies the 90s cliched badguy perfectly (I mean come on, he's named Zorg), yet Oldman still manages to creep me out with his psychopathically blank eyes.This movie isn't about humans being made to love, or war being evil, it's about the silliness of American culture. The whole love theme and the second-thought morality are things mandated in B-movies; You couldn't possible do a 90s mélange without it.Comparing this to Star Wars is ridiculous, but I hazard another comparison I think this movie has done for sci-fi what the Austin Powers movies did for spy movies. It makes us laugh at ourselves, and yet at the same time feel for the characters. I love this movie for the memories, the laughs, the music, and the rhythm, and I think as time passes it will be even more fun to look back on as the decade I grew up in.

I can't believe how well put together this film was from start to finish. This is a feel good movie for movie lovers who just want to clear their minds.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd were well selected to play Marty and Doc. They pulled it off with ease and conviction that I still look at them as though they were still Marty and Doc when performing in other movies and television shows.

What a treat! I was glad to discover that the erotic element, though important, is not the predominant draw here; typically, some references to the film make it sound as though it were some forbidden erotic romp, or full of perverse sexuality. Instead I found myself wrapped up in a creepy suspense-thriller sci-fi-fantasy carried off with wit, style, and extraordinarily interesting photography (including one scene that, at least on my set, was completely black for a couple of minutes).I voted nine for this wonderful film, in part because it left me with a lot to think about, in part just for how well it was made. The music by Toru Takemitsu is absolutely perfect for the task, too.This is just about my favorite kind of film one that raises important questions about human life, but not at the expense of entertainment. It's as close as I'll probably ever come to having my cake and eating it, too.Update, January 2007 I finally obtained my own DVD of this film, one with much higher quality photographic reproduction. I now marvel even more at the extraordinarily creative photography. Be sure, if you view this on DVD, not to boost your set's brightness I can assure you the film is very, very dark on purpose.

But this only makes it increasingly pleasing when a film you'd conceive to be just another genre movie ends up moving you in totally unexpected ways -- as was the case with this small gem of a film. Marvin's Room follows two sisters leading very different lives Bessie (Diane Keaton) is living in Florida and watching over her dying father (Hume Cronyn) and soap-opera-watching aunt (Gwen Verdon), while Lee (Meryl Streep) is taking care of her two fatherless children, Hank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Charlie (Hal Scardino), in Ohio -- as far away from home as she can manage. They may seem like the atypical loyal and rebellious siblings -- and maybe they are -- but they are portrayed with such sincerity and humanity that we hardly even consider their cliched nature. Following a blood test for what she thought was nothing more than a vitamin deficiency, Bessie discovers she has leukemia, but she may have a chance of survival if she can locate a match for her bone marrow. So in enters the other side of the family Lee (whose house was burned down by Charlie -- now in a mental institution) drags her kids to Florida in hopes that one of them will be able to save Bessie's life. Marvin's Room is a delicate balance of two genres that -- while often attempted to be combined -- rarely work together (those genres being comedy and drama, or dramedy as they have been so aptly labeled). But director Jerry Zaks (whose only previous experience was in TV sitcoms) somehow makes it all work, and he infuses just enough originality to allow it to stand apart from everything similar to it. And what it lacks in originality, it makes up for in performances Streep is known for giving hell-bent-for-awards performances, but that doesn't diminish just how good of an actress she really is. DiCaprio is obviously trying to fight against his pretty-boy reputation (see also What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Total Eclipse), and while he might try a little too hard at times, he's still one of the most promising young actors out there. Which brings us to Keaton, the most naturally likable, unconventionally beautiful, and emotionally charged actress to ever grace the screen if this role had been given to anyone but her, the film would have fallen apart. Scott McPherson's script (adapted from his stage play) may not be the most unique piece ever written, but it's certainly heartfelt and genuine. It also features the best driving-on-the-beach sequence since Terms of Endearment (which was obviously a big influence on this picture). Add cameo appearances by Robert DeNiro and Dan Hedaya -- along with an original theme written and performed by Carly Simon -- and you have a spectacular family ensemble drama that's bound to please. Marvin's Room is far from perfect, but that's part of its charm it never tries to present itself as anything other than what it is -- a flawed portrait of flawed characters trying to cope with life.

It is at once full of action and reflective. Leone's masterpiece carries an air of mystery about itself and ends without giving that mystery away...at least not openly.Yet, this movie is never trite.  What Leone created so wonderfully is a rich tapestry of the classic immigrant story. His characters struggle to carve a place for themselves in a new world (the world is always new to a kid; and in the 1910's and 1920's it was new to almost everyone else, as well). All of the characters, even the minor ones, seem to be in constant strife, fighting first to survive and then to thrive in the rich land of America. On one level, this movie is definitely a rags to incredible riches and power story. However, once survival is assured, one cannot always turn off the drive to succeed.Of course, the avenue to success taken by the young lads is one of crime. Yet, their loyalty to each other is almost honorable. One would swear it was truly born of brotherhood, even to the point each sacrificing themeselves for the other.But, no, these are not good people struggling with a bad lot in life. These are criminals who are willing to do whatever it takes to get ahead, including killing people. These are bad people who are very real, only they are not heartless. The violence in their lives is cast more as necessity and part of what has to be done, rather than a goal in itself.What Leone succeeds at doing is making them interesting, truly interesting. The photography, the music and the pacing of the film all work to highlight the dance of friendship between Noodles and Max. For good or bad, when they agree and when they fall out in opposition, they are friends to the core. And, if there is any lesson to learn, it is that friendship, or the absence of it, means more to how one defines one's own life than disagreements and betrayals of that friendship.And so, friendship is in fact the ultimate theme of Once Upon A Time In America and is what makes it more than a mere ganster film. De Niro and Woods are, indeed, two of the best gansters you will ever find. They are real and gritty and good and bad, all rolled up in one. But friendship and its counterpart, betrayal, are the stars.

All of the characters, even the minor ones, seem to be in constant strife, fighting first to survive and then to thrive in the rich land of America. On one level, this movie is definitely a rags to incredible riches and power story. However, once survival is assured, one cannot always turn off the drive to succeed.Of course, the avenue to success taken by the young lads is one of crime. Yet, their loyalty to each other is almost honorable. One would swear it was truly born of brotherhood, even to the point each sacrificing themeselves for the other.But, no, these are not good people struggling with a bad lot in life. These are criminals who are willing to do whatever it takes to get ahead, including killing people. These are bad people who are very real, only they are not heartless. The violence in their lives is cast more as necessity and part of what has to be done, rather than a goal in itself.What Leone succeeds at doing is making them interesting, truly interesting. The photography, the music and the pacing of the film all work to highlight the dance of friendship between Noodles and Max. For good or bad, when they agree and when they fall out in opposition, they are friends to the core. And, if there is any lesson to learn, it is that friendship, or the absence of it, means more to how one defines one's own life than disagreements and betrayals of that friendship.And so, friendship is in fact the ultimate theme of Once Upon A Time In America and is what makes it more than a mere ganster film. De Niro and Woods are, indeed, two of the best gansters you will ever find. They are real and gritty and good and bad, all rolled up in one. But friendship and its counterpart, betrayal, are the stars.

It is at once full of action and reflective. Leone's masterpiece carries an air of mystery about itself and ends without giving that mystery away...at least not openly.Yet, this movie is never trite.

Another great addition was Harvey Keitel, who is one of the most brilliant and versatile actors. Keitel turns in another outstanding performance in U-571. I will never get tired of Harvey Keitel movies because he is so good at what he does. If I had to characterize this movie, I would say it was like Saving Private Ryan in a submarine. The plot to U-571 revolved around a group of sailors with a mission to recover a German enigma, which can transmit secret codes from the German ships to their home base.U-571 is one of those movies that puts on the edge of your seat without letting you know about it; that is how I felt as I was watching it. I truly did not know what would happen next and with each scene it just got better.I don't know who to commend, the director for putting together a perfect movie, the actors for turning in one of the best ensemble cast performances of the year or the writer for making it happen. I think it belongs to each and everyone involved with U-571.If you haven't already seen this movie I recommend that you see it as soon as you can because it is one movie that does not deserve to be missed.

Fox and Christopher Lloyd are back for the last of three excellent films.With each film in the trilogy we have seemed to pick up an addition the main cast. The second film saw introduction of Marty's girlfriend Jennifer and the finale saw Clara Clayton, a love interest for Emmett Doc Brown.The film was set in the 1885 old west, which was a great change. I don't think I would have liked it as much if it was set in 1885 and a regular setting as the viewers witnessed in the first two films.I'm glad I saw this film because it continued to have the same great elements as the first two with the same dialogue and scenes but crafted in such a way that was unique to the trilogy.I was sad to see this great trilogy come to an end but as the cliche goes all good things must come to an end. I can only wonder what would have happened if there more films.If there is anyone who has not seen any of the films in the trilogy, they are missing out on a great piece of nostalgia.
