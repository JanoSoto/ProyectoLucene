Officially, Aliens should be called an action movie, not a horror like the first, because it is not stop and the special effects are top of the line. Acid for blood, and humans for hosts, the aliens of the film are THE image for aliens you will think of from now on. I've seen this movie countless times, and have never picked out a real flaw. It has so many great characters.. Hudson, Bishop, newt, Hicks, all the marines, and ofcoarse Ripley and the aliens themselves. I loved Bishop as the android, and Hudson's panic and foul mouthed presence earned him a lot of fans. The story is a colony establishing an atmosphere on a planet loose communication with 'the company' running the show. USMC marines are sent in to see what's going on and Ripley the survivor of the 1st film reluctantly agrees to go along. The director even lets you get to know each marines personality, each one is a little unique and I thought the cast was really a timeless one. There's some amazing combination of puppets, animatronics, and miniatures used in the film from the drop ships to the amazing face huggers to the new queen alien from. There's enough beeps on motion trackers, futuristic weapons, and ice cold metal cooridors to fill 3 movies. Not to mention this time 'it's war' with literally crowds of aliens coming at us full speed. The most memorable moments are of the crew preparing for the mission at the meal table and bishop the android doing the knife trick at 100 miles an hour between the fingers of a marine who laid his hand on the table (Hudson). But the mega scene is when Ripley has to find the young character (only survivor colonist) named newt, which leads her directly into the alien breeding chamber. The alien queen is simply amazingly done, and the director Jim Cameran really convinced the effects guys to go all the way with it. Well it worked. The result was amazing and pricless. What really made Aliens an absolute action and horror gem was the writing and the amount that was there was just so richly done I was so very impressed. It's by far the best of the series of movies and the best alien film of all time.

That being an important part of a movie it does a perfect job, the movie also left me with a kinda memento aftermath feeling after I was done watching it.

There never has been a movie like this before and there will never be one again, since the way of movie-making and story telling is so brilliantly unique of this movie. It's not really an horror movie, for it's not consistently scary and gory enough for that. The movie can be divided into several parts and to every part of the movie a different genre label can be put. Cronenberg simply chooses to ignore that there are different movie genres and he tries to create his very own movie with his very own unique view and take on the story. He ignores all of the 'Hollywood' movie rules with as a result this brilliant and unique movie.The storytelling is for most part slow and mysterious. It helps to give the movie a certain atmosphere of fear and paranoia. The movie has very few settings and actors in it. It doesn't waste anytime on wide-shots, needless side-plots and characters. Instead it choices a straight forward approach. It works powerful and compelling. We as viewers get immediately drawn into the story and the 'action', so to speak, immediately starts of. It are all reasons why this movie is only 95 minutes short but its long enough to cover everything that has to be told.The unique way of storytelling is probably also the reason why this movie feels so realistic to watch. You just never know what is going to happen next and the characters are mostly unpredictable. The story and characters take several turns as the movie progresses.The wonderful dialog is another thing that adds to the realism of the movie. Of course the dialog is also perfectly delivered by the fine cast. Jeff Goldblum plays his character in a way only Goldblum can. With this movie he deliverers one of his most memorable performances. Geena Davis in this movie also shows that she is a very talented actress. It's too bad her career never really got of the ground, in terms of playing respectable and tough roles. She is a well known Hollywood-star but she never really appeared in any widely acclaimed and respected movie, with the exception of this movie, Beetle Juice and Thelma & Louise, for which she was nominated for an Oscar. Three years before that she even won an Oscar for her role in The Accidental Tourist. But having a successful 5 years just isn't enough for an actress of her caliber. A real shame because when you watch this movie it becomes obvious that the talent is definitely there. John Getz also plays a great role. He plays an unpredictable character that at moments you hate and at others you like him again. Just like in real life, none of the characters are fully bad or fully good. Everyone has a darker less pleasant side and director Cronenberg is not afraid to show this.The special effects are simple and quite poor but considering that this movie was released in 1986, it's acceptable. The Oscar winning make-up effects on the other hand are fantastic. There are very gory. Even more gory than the most hardened horror movie. The make-up effects are one of the main reasons why the horror elements of the movie work out so very well, especially toward the ending. It's probably also the reason why this movie is regarded by many as an of the best horror movies of all time, even though the entire movie itself isn't really an horror movie at all in my opinion.It's a very well constructed movie that can't really be defined. A typical Cronebergian gem, with more layers, meanings and elements in it then you would see at first sight. Almost everything about it is unique. It makes The Fly a one of a kind movie that is an absolute must-see, at least if you have a strong enough stomach, for this movie definitely isn't for the faint of heart.9\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"1 July 2006","score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" The Fly is hard to classify.

The opening sequence takes place on an aeroplane with a killer flight attendant but we find out that it is all fake and all a film set. Now the original film had an opening with something more gripping and then continued to thrill, but this film seems to take a long time to get going which is annoying because the director tries to build character which unfortunately just doesn't happen.The characters are very predictable and at times very annoying and irritating and at some points you as a viewer just want to fast forward to a less annoying part of the film.

Overall the film cannot touch the original because of this films lack of judgment to come up with any real plot and any real characterization thats worth even bothering with. I suggest you only watch this film only if you are any sort of hack and slash buff because you people probably wont be disappointed.**** out of ********** ","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"1 July 2006","score":"17 out of 26 people found the following review useful","review":" This is one of those movies that truly is - and I don't mean to use the cliché - entertaining whether you are a kid or an adult.

Hard to believe at first, but it had too much of a Casper feel. I think this is because the children's ghosts are so amazingly unconvincing and fake-looking, that it is hard to believe they would even release it like this. The children are all generic-looking and doll-like, as if the people who made this never saw a real child. (Could they not get any child actors?) It also reminds me so much of the CGI trickery in the Casper movie, but unlike Casper, this is supposed to be realistic looking, yes?2. I did not at all like the character of Dr. David Marrow, especially in thinking anyone who acts a certain way is having some sort of episode and is in a state of delusion as if he knows everything. Why do some professional people assume they have any more understanding than anyone else (relative to actual experience, not just going to school)? This does happen in real life, but far more in movies, it would seem, I guess to purposely make you hate the character?3. I may be wrong in this, but how many absolutely identical paintings (one in the kitchen?), one on the wall in the stairwell, and at least one more? - were there of Crain? This is not in the lists of goofs as far as I can tell, but seems very obvious, more than other listed goofs. Why would you have copies of the same very large painting in different areas? This was very annoying for me and damaged any potential realism. Dorian Gray, he is not.4. I know the house is always changing, but how can it be so different on the outside than the inside?5. Finally, Mrs. Dudley's in the dark speeches made me laugh, which I do not think was intended, and the I can see my breath scene was also a bit silly.I will say that the carved cherubic faces of the children coming to life and also making outlines in curtains and sheets was very creepy (perhaps the most interesting facet of the whole movie, in concept - having the feel of an old DC comic), but the more obvious CGI ghost children, as well as their unchildlike voices (with regard of what their spirits must have went through, especially), completely ruined these connecting elements.I also feel this movie would have been more entertaining if they had not shown Crain at all in his human form.

The old fashioned love tale is beautiful, but I felt that the context of time travel should have been managed more skillfully.The story centers around a Chicago playwright, Richard Collier, who is approached on the opening night of his first play by an old lady who begs him Come back to me, and presses into his hand a classic pocket watch. Several years later he discovers that this lady is Elise McKenna, a famous stage actress from the early 1900's, whose vintage portrait hangs in the Grand Hotel. Through self hypnosis, he manages to travel back in time to that era, where he meets the beautiful Elise and they fall in love, despite the objections of her manager. Also, despite the difficulties of being separated by almost a century in time.The actors are all wonderful in their roles, the handsome and charming Christopher Reeve playing Richard, with Jane Seymour as Elise, absolutely beautiful, elegant, and radiant in every scene. Christopher Plummer is cast in the part of the overbearing, overprotective, mean spirited, and possessive manager, William Fawcett Robinson. Though Plummer's role isn't intended to be sympathetic, his acting is of course impeccable, and he's such a favorite of mine that I can never quite picture him as the villain of the piece. Personally...don't get angry with me...but I kind of wished he'd ended up settling down himself with this lovely actress for which he obviously has unrequited feelings.My main problem lies with the time travel. This is definitely NOT a science fiction movie. While I wouldn't have expected technical scientific methods in a romance movie, surely the screenwriters could have come up with something a bit more believable than this silly self hypnosis. Though I'm quite a romantic myself, this really made the whole plot seem a little foolish. Also, there are just so many loose ends in connecting the 1912 Elise and the late 20th Century Richard. By the end, I wondered whether I had missed something along the way, so was a bit relieved to discover that a few others had the same problem. With such sloppy screen writing, I felt the producers were relying a little too much on the famous name stars and the dramatic High Romance of it all.It's all pure dreamy romance, fantasy, and fairy tale throughout. Wonderful cinematography, beautiful scenes of Michigan's Mackinac Island and the Grand Hotel, and lavish Oscar nominated turn of the century period costumes. If you can just suspend all critical thought processes, you can enjoy this movie as a haunting fairy tale, an escapist romantic fantasy.

It was back when I was interested in being an animator myself. Through all the strange whimsy of childhood, there was one film in particular that influenced my decision to begin to draw. That film was, The Secret of Nimh.There is a perfect marriage between design, story, color, animation, and music that makes up this animated feature. Although I certainly loved the film Finding Nemo, this kind of artistry, which is almost one hundred percent finished (2D cel animation), Nimh seems to have the upper hand on Fine Art cinema. Just do a frame grab of any moment in the film, put some text next to it in a magazine, and I bet you get a slew of people interested in the film that otherwise would never have watched it.The 80s could have been a dry spell as the blockbuster concept took off, but within that decade, Nimh pulled out ever stop, and Don Bluth didn't seem to waiver from his devotion to telling the story for adults and kids. There are moments in Nimh where you simply have to sit back and say, That's freakn' gutsy for an animated film. Nemo is of course about as safe as it gets. Very little challenges and sweet. Nimh doesn't shy away from dark moments that help us reflect on life and death, finality, and yet hope within those concepts. If you have the time to not be such a grown-up, sit down with the film and give it a look. It still holds up against any cel animated feature ever made, and Bluth's style and marks are all over it. Clean animation, beautiful backgrounds, lush lighting effects. It breaks my heart that Titan A.E. (another film by Bluth) seems to have just been the utter end for the studio, as well as the beginning of the end of 2d cel animation. I am praying for the day when the artistry comes back, and people realize that 3d CG, although certainly with a need, does not, and will never replace 2d cel animation.

Now onto the details. The movie is extremely gory, so don't have a full stomach. Also if you get nightmares easily I'd suggest watching it in the middle of the day as opposed to late at night for the first time because you might have trouble getting that out of your head. I will say young Ashley Laurence completely makes Hellraiser, 3 times more watchable then with a lack of her. She's by far the best actress\/actor on the film with the rest ranging from average to a little cheesy. Don't let that turn you off because the film has other good things, mainly the special effects are quite effective (for an 80's movie you probably won't notice the technology setback). For example the sequence when the body comes up out of the floorboards and starts getting muscle and bone slowly; this movie has it's memorable horror moments for sure. I.e. the Cenobites and the director's portrayal of them as enjoying the suffering of others in a place without rules or 'limits' to what pain you can endure at their expense. People get ripped apart by chains wieled from these creatures minds, body parts and organs hang from wooden racks that spin and through giblets on the walls. Also this movie has some added disgust showing complete adultery and hinting at maybe worse things - something this movie continually does throughout. Another memorable moment is when Ashely's character opens the box that opens these gates to Hell (the cenobites) -the walls heat up, light filters through cracks in the woodwork of the walls, and a hallway opens from a fissure in the wall. As she walks into this new hallway (WHY?) it looks like something out of an underground prison, and baby screams can be heard. About 30 ft. into the hall something is just there when the camera goes there, it's a ugly 'hallway creature' that holds itself up with rear arms that is totally unnatural. Cheesy moments include flowers blooming on television sets to try to give some kind of mood\/symbolism that doesn't work.

So, I put it on tonight and hid behind my bank of computers. I remembered it vividly, but just wanted to see if I could find something I hadn't seen before........I didn't that's because it's so real to me.Another user wrote the ages of the commentators should be shown with their summary. I'm all for that ! It's absolutely obvious that most of these people who've made comments about Midnight Cowboy may not have been born when it was released. They are mentioning other movies Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman have appeared in, at a later time. I'll be just as ruinously frank I am 82-years-old. If you're familiar with some of my other comments, you'll be aware that I was a professional female-impersonator for 60 of those years, and also have appeared in film - you'd never recognize me, even if you were familiar with my night-club persona. Do you think I know a lot about the characters in this film ? YOU BET I DO !!........and am not the least bit ashamed. If you haven't run-into some of them, it's your loss - but, there's a huge chance you have, but just didn't know it. So many moms, dads, sons and daughters could surprise you. It should be no secret MANY actors\/actresses have emerged from the backgrounds of Midnight Cowboy. Who is to judge ? I can name several, current BIG-TIME stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities, and weren't the least bit damaged by their time spent there. I make no judgment, because these are humans, just as we all are - love, courage, kindness, compassion, intelligence, humility you name the attributes, they are all there, no matter what the package looks like.The trivia about Hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of Ratzo is a gem - he can be seen driving his auto all around Los Angeles - how do you think he gets his input? I can also name lots of male-stars who have stood on the streets and cruised the bars for money. Although the nightclub I last worked in for 26 years was world-famous and legit, I can also name some HUGE stars that had to be constantly chased out our back-street, looking to make a pick-up.This should be no surprise today, although it's definitely action in Hollywood and other cities, large and small. Wake-up and smell the roses. They smell no less sweet because they are of a different hue.Some of the users thought Joe Buck had been molested by his grandma. Although I saw him in her bed with a boyfriend, I didn't find any incidence of that. Believe-it-or-not, kids haven't ALWAYS had their own rooms - because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be going-on in the master-bedroom. Whose business? Hoffman may have begged for change on the streets, but some of the users point-out that Jon Voight was not a major star for the filming of Midnight Cowboy - his actual salary would surprise you. I think he was robbed ! No one can doubt the clarity he put into his role, nor that it MADE him a star for such great work as Deliverance. He defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was the better for it few people commented he had been sodomized in this movie. The end of the 60s may have been one of the first films to be so open, but society has always been hip.I also did not find any homosexuality between Ratzo and Joe - they were clearly opposites, unappealing to one another. They found a much purely higher relationship - true friendship. If you didn't understand that at the end of the movie, then you've wasted your time. Joe's bewilderment, but unashamed devotion was apparent. Yes, Voight deserved an Oscar for this role - one that John Wayne could never pull-off, and he was as handsome in his youth.Hoffman is Hoffman - you expect fireworks. He gave them superbly. Wayne got his Oscar. Every character in this film was beautifully defined - if you don't think they are still around, you are mistaken. The party ? - attend some of the raves younger people attend.....if you can get in. Look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot clubs - you'll see every outrageous personality.Brenda Viccaro was the epitome of society's sleek women who have to get down to the nitty-gritty at times. If you were shocked by her brilliant acting, thinking this isn't real, look at today's ladies who live on the brink of disrepute....and are admired for it.The brutality Joe displayed in robbing the old guy, unfortunately, is also a part of life. You don't have to condone it, but it's not too much different than any violence. Joe pointedly named his purpose - in that situation, I'd have handed-over the money quicker than he asked for it. That's one of the scenes that makes this movie a break-through, one which I do not watch. I get heartbroken for both.....John Schlesinger certainly must have been familiar with this sordidness to direct this chillingly beautiful eye-opener- Waldo Salt didn't write from clairvoyance. Anyone who had any part of getting it to the screen must have realized they were making history, and should be proud for the honesty of it.

If you're familiar with some of my other comments, you'll be aware that I was a professional female-impersonator for 60 of those years, and also have appeared in film - you'd never recognize me, even if you were familiar with my night-club persona.

It should be no secret MANY actors\/actresses have emerged from the backgrounds of Midnight Cowboy. Who is to judge ? I can name several, current BIG-TIME stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities, and weren't the least bit damaged by their time spent there. I make no judgment, because these are humans, just as we all are - love, courage, kindness, compassion, intelligence, humility you name the attributes, they are all there, no matter what the package looks like.The trivia about Hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of Ratzo is a gem - he can be seen driving his auto all around Los Angeles - how do you think he gets his input? I can also name lots of male-stars who have stood on the streets and cruised the bars for money. Although the nightclub I last worked in for 26 years was world-famous and legit, I can also name some HUGE stars that had to be constantly chased out our back-street, looking to make a pick-up.This should be no surprise today, although it's definitely action in Hollywood and other cities, large and small. Wake-up and smell the roses. They smell no less sweet because they are of a different hue.Some of the users thought Joe Buck had been molested by his grandma. Although I saw him in her bed with a boyfriend, I didn't find any incidence of that. Believe-it-or-not, kids haven't ALWAYS had their own rooms - because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be going-on in the master-bedroom. Whose business? Hoffman may have begged for change on the streets, but some of the users point-out that Jon Voight was not a major star for the filming of Midnight Cowboy - his actual salary would surprise you.

I love how he can be an icy killer like this, or Willy Wonka or Captain Jack, and pull them all off brilliantly. For instance, in this film, many complain that he didn't change like he was supposed to and that it took no effort on his part except lurking about and using an accent. It would seem to me that these people weren't paying attention. First, we don't have a lot to go on as for the attitude of before Spencer. So maybe those people didn't remember the first few minutes of the film, when we see the couple being playful in bed, watch as he thoughtfully calls his wife from space, and listen to Jillian's sister comment on what a seemingly perfect guy he is. When he comes back, he is quite different. He is icy, not adorable, even if he pulls it off in a sexy way. Even when he is playful, he seems to have to gather his script for it, such as when he is creepily behind the refrigerator and then suddenly becomes his old self. His eyes are extremely different, as they get harsher throughout the movie. Some also complain that the violent sex need not be shown, but I think it's kind of important. First, it again shows contrast between before and after. Second, after his dirty (and extremely sexy, I thought, especially since it's Depp) musings to Jillian about her importance, it gives a clue to his real motives, as once things progress he seems to forget about her thoughts on the matter at all.I thought Charlize Theron was great. She skillfully pulled off this wife's horrible downspiral as she realizes the truth about her life. I thought it was a brilliant portrayal.I love the odd camera angles that show what they need to. Especially during the violent sex. Helped me bear it. Also the subway scene, it was a great display of what her mental state was.I'm still somewhat confused over the importance of the planes and the twins and such, but I bet if I watched it a few more times I'd understand better.I really liked the end. Throughout the whole thing I was like she'll kill herself and then what does she do? I thought was brilliant until the alien jumped bodies. I just don't understand how that works, although I suppose it could have to do with the electricity and the water.So, yeah, I think it was great. Its full potential was not met, obviously. I think with a few slight differences it could have been a classic.

Time moves up to the present, and Crawford, who now seems cured, is allowed to come home to live with her brother and his wife and the daughter she had left in their care. William Castle directs this campy classic with a pretty strait-forward approach as Lucy comes home and strange things start to happen to her and around her and, of course in a film like this, to other people and their health and welfare. Has she regressed? Well, I cannot answer that question here and now, but just remember one thing - this film was directed by William Castle. The acting in this film is good by all accounts Diane Baker does a credible job as the daughter trying to cope with having her mother back. George Kennedy axes the wrong questions as he plays a farmhand with callous seediness. But it is Crawford that will have your attention throughout. Not necessarily because she is real good but because she doesn't seem to mind at all playing a fool to her image. When she comes out in a flowered dress with bangles on her arm as a bracelet and an obvious wig in the prologue sequence - she looks so ridiculous that you know this has to be high camp. She supposedly is playing a young, swinging, virile woman but looks like she's been roaming a nursing home for a few years. When she gets back to the present, she plays herself for a bit, but then things start to turn her back into sexy, campy Joan. Check out the scene where she hits on her daughter's boyfriend with the record player playing. It sent chills down my spine and raised what hairs I have on my head. It has to be one of the campiest portrayals - whether intended or not - I have ever seen. Give this one a look just for Joan's performance! As for the axe murders - they are done fairly suspensefully and Castle has always been more than competent behind the lens with this type of material.
