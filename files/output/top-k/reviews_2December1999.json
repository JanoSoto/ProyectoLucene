They are attacked by a bandit and in the fight the nobleman is killed. There is a trial at which we hear the bandit's version and then the wife's. A Bhuddist medium summons the soul of the dead man and gives his version. Many events coincide (a fight, a death) but the meanings and implications in each version differ a great deal. Three men discuss the events and significance of the differences while they take shelter from a pouring rain under the gate to the city. One of these is a woodcutter; he not only observed the trial and tells his companions what was said but he, hidden in the woods, also actually saw the events and he tells his friends his version. Again we find the coinciding events but the differing meanings and implications. He'd not told anyone else what he'd seen or testified because he didn't want to get involved. He's very puzzled and disturbed as to why each version differs, what do these differences say about the nature of people?This is a powerful, beautiful movie which altered the linear style of movie narratives that had existed until then and opened new vistas, e.g., Crash, Hero and Eastwood's two Iwo Jimass. When I first saw this movie 40 years ago, its slight misogynist flavor (women are manipulative) didn't register on me and probably didn't on most others in the 1950s-60s; our culture has probably shifted a great deal since then.But Rashomon has significance far beyond its contribution to movie making. I'll point to its influence on Family Therapy; an analogous effect is true for history or ANY field in which there can be points of view that differ with human motivations and alliances (say world history from the point of view of victors or vanquished, or various anthropologists accounts of living with particular tribes, etc.)The Rashomon Effect (a term used in family systems) refers to the quite different perceptions that even closely related individuals can have of the same event or person. E.g., in any family, say one with several children, no family member has quite the same view of any other family member. In a real sense, none of the children have quite the same mother or father and therefore must view them and each other differently. The first born child entered the family when its parents had a certain financial level and experiences. The second child enters when the parents have been changed by time and the experience of having a first child so they are not quite the same parents. If the parents invested in the first child particular aspirations or hopes, favoritism or disfavor, that must strongly color that child's view of them and any younger siblings, as well as a second child's view of each parent, the older sib, etc. These various views can differ greatly among all members of that family system.

So much of what makes this film great is the amazing sound track, with cool songs like the Extended Transformers Theme, Weird Al's Dare To Be Stupid and the action song The Touch, that Dirk Diggler sings in Boogie Nights.

You aren't going to witness a hammy BLOWN AWAY-like heap of garbage. You know exactly what you are going to feel during the whole ride and how you are going to feel after it's over.And that's waaaaay before the paranoia starts. Directed by Mark Pellington, who has very unusual angles with his cameras (sometimes I felt I was hanging over characters), we are given an American suburban nightmare. A man (Jeff Bridges) who's family, and the remaining strands of his life, are in danger when he comes closer and closer to finding a terrorist in the neighborhood.It's not too surprising to figure out who that is, what is surprising, and confusing, is how he gets away with his plan. Tim Robbins is one of my favorite, underrated actors. I knew he could play a villain from Robert Altman pictures like THE PLAYER and SHORT CUTS, but I never knew I could be terrified of him! And even while you fear him or hate him, you always see his point behind his actions, although they are drastic, and not the answer.I liked Jeff Bridges, but Tim gave the better performance. What I also liked the use of supporting characters. Hope Davis could have been so wasted as the girlfriend, but she comes out as a key player as she deals with the frustration of Bridges looking back on his dead wife and watching him grow paranoid and go out of his mind. Also good is Robert Gossett as Bridges' friend and collegue in the FBI and Joan Cusack, who uses her unusually warm smile in a very icy way.The only problem I had was the lagging pace the film had. It never really had a good rhythm with some of the very suspenseful scenes. And nothing, except the end of course, matched the feeling I felt in the beginning.Still, Mark Pellington and cinematographer Bobby Bukowski gives us a bleached, corrosive world under a plastic suburban security in Ehren Kruger's frightening screenplay.

You aren't going to witness a hammy BLOWN AWAY-like heap of garbage. You know exactly what you are going to feel during the whole ride and how you are going to feel after it's over.And that's waaaaay before the paranoia starts. Directed by Mark Pellington, who has very unusual angles with his cameras (sometimes I felt I was hanging over characters), we are given an American suburban nightmare. A man (Jeff Bridges) who's family, and the remaining strands of his life, are in danger when he comes closer and closer to finding a terrorist in the neighborhood.It's not too surprising to figure out who that is, what is surprising, and confusing, is how he gets away with his plan.

The music is stunning all through the film. Then, when Joan is arrested and the old man in black visits her, the film gets into another mood. I was like in trance when all through the film, because of the hypnotic effect of the wonderful images combined with the glorious music. The actress who plays Joan is also doing a great job, as are the others. The only funny thing I noticed that her hairstyle looks the one Jean Seberg had, but since Seberg is so much connected to filming the story of Joan no one making a film about Joan can escape her mythos. There are also some good jokes in the movie, so it has not a totally grave atmosphere.

","genre":"Action, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"2 December 1999","score":"","review":"  In his usual dark style, Tim Burton has put a new spin on an old tale that will leave you in awe of his fantastic vision.With this work, Burton's cinematography has matured exquisitely. The setting and landscapes for Sleepy Hollow are breathtaking and surreal, contrasting dark hues of grey with the brilliance of deep crimson in its more chilling scenes.Johnny Depp's reprisal of Ichabod Crane is slight camp, reminiscent of his role as Ed Wood. It's as if Depp has studied old black and white film actors with an unusual amount of interest; his mannerisms and expressions could have been taken from any one of the old greats of the fifties.Surprising cameos from Christopher Lee and Martin Landau are wonderfully effective, but the most satisfying comes from the Headless Horseman himself, played by the sinister Christopher Walken. His portrayal of the man before the legend is brief but powerful due to creative use of make-up, complete with teeth filed down to sharp little daggers and contacts that make his already menacing gaze even more frightening.If you are expecting to be terrified out of your wits, then you will be disappointed. But there are more than a few good jumps to shake things up as well as 'tasteful' use of special effects that do not overpower the film, only add to it. The heads roll magnificently!Photographically speaking, this is Tim Burton's best film and the slight changes in the original legend are necessary to achieve his vision. Depp's Ichabod Crane is an investigator trying to find new ways of solving crime through amateur forensics complete with his own handmade surgical instruments. This makes for good comedy as well as good gore in some of the film's funnier moments.A plot twist near the end leaves Ichabod thinking he's found the truth, but more is to follow as the story climaxes and changes direction before finally coming to a close. No spoilers here, but all in all I found Sleepy Hollow to be a  fun film with all the elements of a good ghost story. The escapist part of me was taken by the creative use of sets and camera work. A good piece of cinema!
