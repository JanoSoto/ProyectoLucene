Gattaca is an very intelligence low key sci-fi film from then first-time writer-director Andrew Niccol.In the future people parents are able to genetically engineer their children to minimalist the risk of genetic diseases and even cosmetic issues such as eyesight, baldness and obesity. Doctors can find out from birth whether a child is at risk of any conditions. Because of this society is divided into two, the rich genetically engineered people who can land any job they want and an underclass of 'faith' births, people with the likelihood of having genetic defects, people who from birth destined to work in lowly jobs. One of them is Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), a man who dreams of going into space, a man with obvious intelligence and determination but discriminated because it is predicted that he will die at 30. Vincent assumes the identity of Jerome Eugene Morrow (Jude Law), a disabled man with the right genetic make-up. Everything seems to be going well, Vincent has been picked to go on a mission to Saturn's moon Titan, but his life's ambition is put under threat when a man in murdered and Vincent becomes a suspect just because of his DNA.The obvious theme of Gattaca is the idea of prejudice that always been in some form or another. In this future race is not a way to discriminate but of course based on genetic make-up, believing that they are destined to a certain path in life no matter what their actually physical state or mental abilities. It forces an underclass into a vicious circle of low expectations and life of self-fulfilling prophecy. A modern parallel is the American Health Insurance industry where people are discriminated against if they have a pre-existing condition or dodgy family history and if its discovered that someone has been lying then their cover is ended, it a industry that looks to avoid paying out, it is a horrible amoral industry.Added to that police would suspect someone from the underclass because they have a tendency to be more violence, almost like racism in the police where they question someone because of their background intend of looking at other evidence. And someone could be cold and cunning to murder someone without being violence.But there is also a positive theme that despite any artificial disadvantage it can be overcome if someone is willing, determined and able enough. And that how I feel in real life if you are willing to work hard and keep trying then you should be able to achieve your goals.There is also a theme of identity, that someone has to steal someone else's identity so he could fulfil his ambition and deny himself. There is an even bigger issue because Vincent was pretty much rejected by his family because they did not support their son, wanted him to accept his 'limitations'. It could even be played that the son was rejected for being like mixed-raced or gay, but maybe I am just overreading it.Another idea explored is it man's place to play God with itself or simply let nature take its course? Wouldn't any parent want to give their child the best chance in live a good life. It is certainly an issue that is around today because of IVF and it could be taken further and further.I really like the world that Nicoll created. It was a deliberately understated world, a cold world and that makes this world more believable. There seems to be references to great sci-fi like A Brave New World and Metropolis particularly with the ideas of two different classes, the wealth upper class and the underclass that does all the grunt work.

Although this film left out some minor characters such as Strawberry and Bluebell and only had one story of El-ahrairah depicted whereas the book has several it is still a very faithful adaptation to the novel. My favorite character by far is Bigwig because he is the strongest and fights courageously against Woundwort and I think he should be the leader instead of Hazel. However my favorite scene in the film is when Bigwig finally admits that Hazel is Chief Rabbit when Woundwort says Why don't you come out Bigwig? and Bigwig responds by saying My chief's told me to defend this run and Woundwort responds by saying YOUR chief? as if imagining a rabbit bigger and stronger than Bigwig (a scary thought indeed) Also the animation is pretty good for a British animated movie this old.

Kenneth Branagh plays a Manhattan entertainment writer who starts to lose control of his life after getting a divorce from his wife (Judy Davis). A year later he's trying to get a script and novel off the ground while his ex hits a string of good luck after suffering a breakdown. CELEBRITY was mangled by critics when it was released but over the past few years it seems to have gained a small cult following but this time out I must say I'm on the side of the critics. I'm sure there were some good ideas going around Allen's head but whatever happened between his mind and paper is something rather shocking because the problem here is without question his screenplay. It's weird to think but at 113- minutes this here is actually one of the longest running films from Allen and what's so amazing is that it probably says the least. The film is certainly trying to make fun of rich New Yorkers and stuck-up and spoiled Hollywood types but there's never any hint of insider's knowledge and it's as if Allen didn't want to go all out. I'd probably go as far as to call the screenplay lazy. Just take a look at a young, violent actor played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The entire sequence with him screaming and trying to beat up his girlfriend just comes off very weak. You even have a bit with a model (Charlize Theron) who has an orgasm no matter where she's touched. Neither of these segments are any good but the sad thing is that they're perhaps the best stuff in the film. Another problem I had was with the performance by Branagh. There's no question that he's one of the most talented actors out there but he's just horrible playing what's basically a version of Woody Allen. The mannerisms don't work and the actor just never captures that nervous twitch of Allen. One of the best performances in the film actually goes to Winonna Ryder playing a love interest in the film. Davis is also pretty good in her role but the screenplay doesn't do her character any favors. Michael Lerner, Joe Mantegna, Gretchen Mol and Melanie Griffith round out the supporting cast. CELEBRITY is without question a rare misfire from Allen. The only real thing going for it is the brilliant cinematography by Sven Nykvist who makes the film look a lot better than it actually is.

A team of archaeologists or historians of sorts are examining ancient runes. These runes turn out to be a prophesy about the state of the Universe far into the future - a state wherein a Fifth Element is needed in order to prevent everything from falling under the rule of darkness. Right off the bat, the script is smart and creative, the visuals are beautiful to look at, and I'm ready to settle in for another Besson masterpiece... Then in roll the aliens.Have you ever seen The Dark Crystal? If not, all you need to know is that it's a laughably awful movie from the creator of The Muppets which happens to have a very similar storyline - and the stupidest looking puppets ever designed. Well, the aliens that landed in Egypt in 1914 apparently came straight from that horrible movie. So much for my high expectations.Cut scene to 300 years later where Jedi Master Bilbo Baggins - aka Father Cornelius played by the very talented Ian Holm - is talking to what I imagine to be the President of the Universe(imagine the election process) about the all-powerful elemental stones and the perfect being that will play a key part saving all life from falling under evil forces. Yadda-yadda-yadda. Cool.On that note, we meet Bruce Willis who is reprising his role in Die Hard in the form of Korben Dallas - a washed up hover-taxi(gag me)driver with more to him than meets the eye. But for now, all he wants is to avoid losing another point off of his license and to find the perfect woman to settle down with. BAM. Who else should fall through the roof of his cab but an orange haired and babbling Milla Jovovich - who just so happens to be, well, the perfect woman. She's even gift-wrapped in a strategically placed ribbon. Oh yeah, she's also the Fifth Element. How perfect! But what's a space flick without a campy villain working for the forces of evil? Enter Jean Baptist Emanuel Zorg, an intergalactic arms dealer who is trading his weapons for the aforementioned stones so that he can hand them over to the bad guys... Pfft, Who needs a future of peace and happiness for all living beings? Apparently not this guy, who looks like Deep-South Hitler combined with the Gay Pride Parade - And is played by none other than the fab-u-lous Gary Oldman. Zorg is one of the many many factors that make this film completely ridiculous, but he is nonetheless the most entertaining thing about it.That's really all I'm going to tell you for now plot-wise, but if you decide to watch this film, keep in mind that you are in for a frenetic and obnoxious space adventure that combines every element from every nonsense space film ever created into a big,cheesy,ultra-campy, but undeniably captivating mess. Why is it captivating? Well, it's certainly not anything to do with Chris Tucker's teeth-grindingly irritating performance as big media personality with hair resembling either a handgun or a penis, but because of Besson's imaginative use of bright colours, fast-paced storytelling, amusing characters, and that hauntingly beautiful voice of an odd-looking blue Diva.Does this redeem Fifth Element from its many flaws? Certainly not. I mean, there's hardly a moment where someone isn't stuttering or just spewing out nonsense in a whiny voice, the dialogue can be super-lame at times, and Besson's futuristic universe looks as though it was engineered by 12 year old boys who spend every Saturday morning watching the Jetsons... And as for the costumes? I weep for the future of fashion.So I'm giving this movie a 5\/10. It was completely silly from start to finish, but as long as you don't take it seriously, it's kinda cute. I would recommend it for younger audiences.

But for now, all he wants is to avoid losing another point off of his license and to find the perfect woman to settle down with. BAM. Who else should fall through the roof of his cab but an orange haired and babbling Milla Jovovich - who just so happens to be, well, the perfect woman. She's even gift-wrapped in a strategically placed ribbon. Oh yeah, she's also the Fifth Element. How perfect! But what's a space flick without a campy villain working for the forces of evil? Enter Jean Baptist Emanuel Zorg, an intergalactic arms dealer who is trading his weapons for the aforementioned stones so that he can hand them over to the bad guys... Pfft, Who needs a future of peace and happiness for all living beings? Apparently not this guy, who looks like Deep-South Hitler combined with the Gay Pride Parade - And is played by none other than the fab-u-lous Gary Oldman. Zorg is one of the many many factors that make this film completely ridiculous, but he is nonetheless the most entertaining thing about it.That's really all I'm going to tell you for now plot-wise, but if you decide to watch this film, keep in mind that you are in for a frenetic and obnoxious space adventure that combines every element from every nonsense space film ever created into a big,cheesy,ultra-campy, but undeniably captivating mess. Why is it captivating? Well, it's certainly not anything to do with Chris Tucker's teeth-grindingly irritating performance as big media personality with hair resembling either a handgun or a penis, but because of Besson's imaginative use of bright colours, fast-paced storytelling, amusing characters, and that hauntingly beautiful voice of an odd-looking blue Diva.Does this redeem Fifth Element from its many flaws? Certainly not. I mean, there's hardly a moment where someone isn't stuttering or just spewing out nonsense in a whiny voice, the dialogue can be super-lame at times, and Besson's futuristic universe looks as though it was engineered by 12 year old boys who spend every Saturday morning watching the Jetsons... And as for the costumes? I weep for the future of fashion.So I'm giving this movie a 5\/10. It was completely silly from start to finish, but as long as you don't take it seriously, it's kinda cute. I would recommend it for younger audiences.

A team of archaeologists or historians of sorts are examining ancient runes. These runes turn out to be a prophesy about the state of the Universe far into the future - a state wherein a Fifth Element is needed in order to prevent everything from falling under the rule of darkness. Right off the bat, the script is smart and creative, the visuals are beautiful to look at, and I'm ready to settle in for another Besson masterpiece... Then in roll the aliens.Have you ever seen The Dark Crystal? If not, all you need to know is that it's a laughably awful movie from the creator of The Muppets which happens to have a very similar storyline - and the stupidest looking puppets ever designed. Well, the aliens that landed in Egypt in 1914 apparently came straight from that horrible movie. So much for my high expectations.Cut scene to 300 years later where Jedi Master Bilbo Baggins - aka Father Cornelius played by the very talented Ian Holm - is talking to what I imagine to be the President of the Universe(imagine the election process) about the all-powerful elemental stones and the perfect being that will play a key part saving all life from falling under evil forces.

With Rope comes the first time in which he really builds something totally new, in that case bending camera movement, creating a cinematic eye, bright and new. Dial M... Rear Window, Vertigo, even Psycho. All those are works which you have to see.But before Rope, what we have are hints. In this film, there are a few bits of framing and camera movement which are really cleverly and conceived. The coffee cup framed while a dialogue is going on. The crane shot that begins opened to the house lobby space, and closes on Bergman's hand, holding the key. Those are really nice, and do something very hitchcockian a scene where apparently nothing relevant happens (a trifle dialog, the simple arrival of guests), but through the camera movement and framing, a new meaning is given to a detail of the scene. Purely visual, few people worked as a purely visual mind as well as H.. But the grand picture, here and in nearly every film before Rope, is just not that great.

The deadly Motobe Virus somehow traveled, inside the body of a South American white-headed capuchin monkey, to the US in an South Korean freighter.Before you know it the Motobe Virus starts to spread like wild fire ending up at the sea side town of Ceader Creek California infecting the entire population there! It's there at Ceder Creek where the local population, some 3,000 people, is kept from leaving town by the US Military and is targeted to be exterminated together with every living and breathing thing there. It soon becomes evident to US Army doctor of Infectious Diseases Sam Daniels, Dustin Hoffman, and his good friend Gen. Billy Ford, Morgan Freeman, that this virus is something that was developed in secret by the CIA With the help of Gen. Donald McClintock, Donald Sutherland. It's Gen McClintcock who in fact discovered the virus back in 1967 in a black-ops mission in Central Africa that he was in charge of! That's when he ordered an entire town in the Motobe Valley that included scores of American soldiers and mercenaries to be decimated by a BLU-82 15,000 pound fire bomb-or Dasiy Cutter-to prevent it from spreading into the neighboring districts!To the shock of everyone involved it soon become evident that this virus, unlike the one back in 1967, has mutated and become airborne making it ten times as deadly. It's Dr.Daniels and his hot shot helicopter pilot Maj. Salt, Cuba Gooding Jr, who doubles as an expert in the field of biotechnology science who are stuck, somebody got to do it, in saving the US as well as the world from this deadly and unstoppable virus. The person who's behind all this death and destruction Gen. McClintock is determined to keep his and his fellow military and CIA men involvement in the deadly Motobe Virus secret even from the President of the United States himself. They in fact plan to use it as a WMD, Weapon of Mass Destruction, in any future conflict that the US, in the open or secretly, would became involved in. Which would be considered a major war crime by the Geneva Convention, on the conduct of war, of 1929 & 1949.Getting back to the movie It's Gen.

I wish he would get more great parts, because he can eat up the right material, as evidenced well here. I'm going to have to delve into more of his lesser known work.Back to Limey though, the story isn't anything special (a dangerous criminal fresh out of prison goes to Los Angeles to avenge his daughter's death) but with Soderbergh's flare for unique and interesting styles, he makes it feel like you're watching this story play out for the first time. The dialogue flies off the page, written by Lem Dobbs although there are clearly some Soderbergh tilts in certain scenes (his Cockney slang, for one) and the actors all know just what they're doing. It's short and sweet and all builds up to a delightful climax, followed with an appropriately bittersweet ending.

Now I could forgive a bad film if the elements used to tell the story had some kind of internal consistency, but this one is just all over the place. Think about it - the forces of evil are unleashed on Earth and Satan himself is scouring the streets of New York looking for the virginal bride that will plunge the entire world into chaos and eternal hell fire. So an alcoholic ex-cop with a nine millimeter Glock handgun is going to stop him? Seriously, how much thought was put into this? Now I never saw this film until today, kind of appropriate I think because it's New Year's Day 2012, and later this year we'll have to get ready for the end of the world again when the Mayan Calendar runs it's course. Thoroughly familiar with the '666' Sign of the Beast concept, I just about doubled over when Rod Steiger came up with that '999' business - how could the film makers have ever foreseen Herman Cain's ill-fated economic plan an entire decade ago? I guess that's just one of the unintended bonuses of waiting until just the right time to watch an action flick in which the devil takes center stage.Now I'll give credit where credit is due. The rattlesnake blood baptism of the newborn Christine was an intriguingly creative element, but if demonic forces were already at work at the tail end of 1979, why let the kid grow up in New York City and allow the Governator to get involved? The ceiling crucifixion of the visionary assassin priest was noteworthy, as well as the creepy subway guy who shattered into pieces - both were cool effects that might have carried more weight in a better story. The same goes for the underground ancient guy with his eyelids sewn shut.But in the final analysis, none of this matters at all. I tried holding it together until the epic final battle between the forces of good and evil, when all of a sudden Arnie broke my concentration by yelling to Christine as they entered St. John's - We must lock the doors!

She gets the chance to achieve this with her boss, the editor Rigfort (Pretty Woman director Garry Marshall) sending undercover in a high school to see what the modern teenagers are like. So at South Glen South High School she poses as a student, but with her simple ways she is instantly looked on as the accident prone brainy geek, and this does not do her any favours as in her real life Josie has never been kissed romantically. Her brother Rob (David Arquette) does his best to make her over, and soon enough he poses as a student in the high school himself, and the siblings both find love interests, in Josie's case she has feelings for her bachelor teacher Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan). The deadline for making her story is drawing closer, and the risk of blowing her cover is becoming even more large as her personal feelings towards the school inhabitants are getting in the way. In the end, even though her true identity is revealed, Josie does manage to write a very concise and informative story about her experiences acting like and being teenagers, and of course, with the help of her story, she manages to get her true love first kiss with Sam.

Schindler's List deals with subject matter so sensitive, and tells one of the most important stories of the entire century, that the makers absolutely have to get it right, on every level. Thankfully, they did.Screenwriter Steve Zaillian has taken on the difficult task of adapting a work of non-fiction. Much of the picture is simply a series of vignettes, most not strictly necessary to the plot, the sort of material that has been cut for reasons of space in a thousand lesser pictures. But they contribute to an overall tone &#x96; each has its own meaning, and to cut one would make for a poorer film. Although it of course follows real events as closely as possible, great care is taken with the rate at which we are exposed to the magnitude of horror. The first two deaths we see &#x96; the one-armed man and the civil engineer &#x96; are painfully shocking. But by the time we get to the ransacking of the ghetto we are desensitised to the killing, immersed in this world where the ending of life is a casual act. Lines of dialogue which at first seem trivial gain resonance later on. When meeting with the black marketers Schindler tells them Nice things cost money. Eventually he will be buying human lives.In evaluations of Schindler's List, so often the importance of the man who portrayed the title role is forgotten. Liam Neeson's performance perhaps doesn't stand out too much because it is very low-key, and the character is almost passive for all his significance. But this makes Neeson's work all the more impressive. He puts all of Schindler's emotion, all his thought, into this restrained façade. Schindler was a man who essentially spent the whole war keeping up a pretence, albeit for altruistic purposes, that he was a good party member and practical businessman, and Neeson handles this contradiction flawlessly. When he allows the floodgates to open in his final scene, the effect is devastating.Steven Spielberg famously offered this project to a number of directors before deciding to take on the job himself. It could have been disastrous &#x96; his direction is appalling in The Color Purple, his first real drama &#x96; but in the intervening years he had improved considerably. For Schindler's List he takes an incredibly indirect approach, his camera often separated from the action or just focusing briefly on hands and objects, as if the material is somehow distant and difficult to fully engage with. Despite this distancing effect, Spielberg proves himself a master at picking out the important detail in each shot. To give one example, when we first see Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, he is right at the back of a room with a dozen or so people in, but Spielberg has arranged everyone into diagonals so that our eyes are drawn straight to Kingsley. Spielberg's utter simplicity and lack of camera trickery are commendable. His careful pacing of scenes makes those all-important lines stand out, and emphasises the life in the people.And this &#x96; the life &#x96; is essentially what Schindler's List is about. I didn't really intend to comment on the issues in the picture because I wanted to discuss it mainly as an example of perfection in filmmaking. But like any movie Schindler's List is not without its detractors, and sometimes people do miss the point. Spielberg has been accused of sugar-coating the holocaust, of taking this horrible event in history and making an uplifting story out of it. Of course, the Nazis did many more terrible things which the movie does not show, and it does end upon a note of hope. But the truth is, Schindler's List is not the story of the holocaust. It is the story of Oskar Schindler, a man who saved lives. The tragedies that occurred in Europe are the backdrop to this story, and the realities that Spielberg offers us a modest window onto are nonetheless graphic enough to give it meaning.

Much of the picture is simply a series of vignettes, most not strictly necessary to the plot, the sort of material that has been cut for reasons of space in a thousand lesser pictures. But they contribute to an overall tone &#x96; each has its own meaning, and to cut one would make for a poorer film. Although it of course follows real events as closely as possible, great care is taken with the rate at which we are exposed to the magnitude of horror. The first two deaths we see &#x96; the one-armed man and the civil engineer &#x96; are painfully shocking. But by the time we get to the ransacking of the ghetto we are desensitised to the killing, immersed in this world where the ending of life is a casual act. Lines of dialogue which at first seem trivial gain resonance later on. When meeting with the black marketers Schindler tells them Nice things cost money. Eventually he will be buying human lives.In evaluations of Schindler's List, so often the importance of the man who portrayed the title role is forgotten. Liam Neeson's performance perhaps doesn't stand out too much because it is very low-key, and the character is almost passive for all his significance. But this makes Neeson's work all the more impressive. He puts all of Schindler's emotion, all his thought, into this restrained façade. Schindler was a man who essentially spent the whole war keeping up a pretence, albeit for altruistic purposes, that he was a good party member and practical businessman, and Neeson handles this contradiction flawlessly. When he allows the floodgates to open in his final scene, the effect is devastating.Steven Spielberg famously offered this project to a number of directors before deciding to take on the job himself. It could have been disastrous &#x96; his direction is appalling in The Color Purple, his first real drama &#x96; but in the intervening years he had improved considerably. For Schindler's List he takes an incredibly indirect approach, his camera often separated from the action or just focusing briefly on hands and objects, as if the material is somehow distant and difficult to fully engage with. Despite this distancing effect, Spielberg proves himself a master at picking out the important detail in each shot. To give one example, when we first see Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, he is right at the back of a room with a dozen or so people in, but Spielberg has arranged everyone into diagonals so that our eyes are drawn straight to Kingsley. Spielberg's utter simplicity and lack of camera trickery are commendable. His careful pacing of scenes makes those all-important lines stand out, and emphasises the life in the people.And this &#x96; the life &#x96; is essentially what Schindler's List is about. I didn't really intend to comment on the issues in the picture because I wanted to discuss it mainly as an example of perfection in filmmaking. But like any movie Schindler's List is not without its detractors, and sometimes people do miss the point. Spielberg has been accused of sugar-coating the holocaust, of taking this horrible event in history and making an uplifting story out of it. Of course, the Nazis did many more terrible things which the movie does not show, and it does end upon a note of hope. But the truth is, Schindler's List is not the story of the holocaust. It is the story of Oskar Schindler, a man who saved lives. The tragedies that occurred in Europe are the backdrop to this story, and the realities that Spielberg offers us a modest window onto are nonetheless graphic enough to give it meaning. This is not primarily a picture about the evil that went on, it is about the good that existed in spite of that evil. And if ever there was something worth making a motion picture about, it is this.

This was probably one of the first of its kind to bring legendary cartoon characters to live action. I guarantee many will see this and think how bad it is but then you watch it a few more times and it starts to grow on you and you begin to see the often brilliant things about it. It is the definition of a 'cult classic.' Director Robert Altman brings style and unique direction to the film bringing to life in such a cartoony and over the top but real life way. The citizens of Sweet Haven are so boisterous and fun to watch. Who better to bring to life Popeye than the legendary comedian Robin Williams who does a terrific job paying homage to the famous cartoon sailor. Never once will you feel like he is poking fun at the source material. Shelley Duvall certainly looks the part of Olive Oyl but my goodness is she ever annoying (perhaps that's the point.) Paul Smith is terrific as Bluto, the perfect adversary and like the other characters look his part perfectly. Same could be said for Paul Dooley who plays Wimpy, although he is very underused and sort of unlikable in the role.Popeye's cult status really thrives on the look of the film. There is just something incredibly unique and different about the style of the movie. I probably would have avoided making this a musical as it has a Broadway feel to it but the songs aren't very catchy and just don't add anything to the story. Fans of Popeye are sure to not be disappointed but kids might not take to the movie because it does sort of have a dark undertone. It is absolutely something to check out for its uniqueness but it won't ever be called a stone cold classic. Still something I watch every few years and get a few laughs out of and enjoy. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 January 2012","score":"","review":" Translating cartoon to real life is not easy and rarely done well.

Whilst Rooney's 'Mr Yunioshi' should have been recast with an actual Asian actor (and it wasn't like there weren't any around in 1961), the other two criticisms prove less concrete when examined. Simply put, you couldn't have an implicitly gay narrator (the George Peppard character) or a lusty, foul-mouthed bisexual 'heroine' in 1961. Neither could the novella's haunting, wistful ending (she actually does go to Brazil and they never meet again) have made it into such a major Hollywood movie. Even so, given the characters' parameters, it is fair to assume that their reconciliation and apparent resumption of their romance is merely a temporary situation. After all, both Holly and Paul are deeply flawed people, with manifest (and largely unresolved) commitment issues. Both are people-users, dependent for their livelihoods on the largesse of others and neither deals well with brutal reality (although Paul grows a backbone and ceases his involvement with '2-E', the married woman who keeps him in his apartment as a boy-toy). However, they reveal their vulnerabilities when together and become entirely understandable (if not wholly likable) characters. This movie is popularly regarded as a classic, mainly for its undeniable sense of style (New York is beautiful, and if only all the call-girls looked like Audrey Hepburn circa 1961. Yes indeed...), the charm of both its stars and the engaging screenplay\/direction. The underlying darkness is still there though, and one does wonder just how long Holly and Paul really did (or feasibly could) stay together after that final scene in the alleyway. Still, 'BAT' endures as an enjoyable, absorbing rom-com and a fascinating time-capsule of post-1950s, pre-Beatles chic. One final point; the makers supposedly used several cats to portray 'Cat'. From the way the poor creature was alarmingly used and abused throughout, I'm not surprised.
