The answer is a clear and distinctive YES.What you also might be surprised about when watching this film is that it is a Robert Rodriguez film, it's a film where he was tied down by the studio but never the less he makes a great effort all the way through and his direction is clear and crisp and brings the teen spirit of the nineties quite comfortably to the screen.There are some great actors in this movie, Jordana Brewster, Robert Patrick, Josh Hartnett and Jon Stewart to name a select few. Each brings a unique quality to their role and never really takes themselves seriously, rather portraying the overblown, over the top qualities we might expect. However Elijah Wood must be given special credit for his portrayal in the film. If anyone is believable in this film it's him playing his role with good direction via Rodriguez. I felt strongly and was rooting for this character right the way through the film.The film is well paced and Rodriguez shows his talent as director\/editor with his ability to pace the film. The fun build takes us to an hour in while the final fifty minutes are pure action\/sci-fi glory.I believe that this film is a great effort and a true effort at bringing a bored and out of tune genre back into fashion, while the film does share those characteristics of its Scream predecessors, such as the characters referencing every sci-fi film possible (even using Invasion of the Body Snatchers to help win the day!) it is a great film to sit down with on a Saturday night and settle back into the couch and forget about life.It's time to remember the days when you thought old Mrs. Neckingbottom was an evil alien from mars or Mr. Sideward is the king alien from Zuton, either way its a great memory filler and a great great ride and much better than a lot of trash being released this summer!

It's why there's a critic in all of us, writers and movie goers alike, it's why those who can watch will be able to judge accordingly even if we may not be totally right or even able to reproduce what we are seeing.Now, the premise of BULLETS OVER Broadway is just that a playwright finds a producer for his play in the Roaring Twenties. The catch is, the producer in charge for the plays financing is a mobster. The second catch is, he wants his outrageously stupid moll to play the lead. But the third has to be the strangest of them all one of the mobster's henchmen happens to know this play better than its very own playwright. He thinks that the moll makes a terrible actress. He literally... takes over.And that's it. Woody Allen thankfully is not present in this movie other than its writer and director -- it is becoming something of a stretch to see Allen, who is about as visually inviting as an eyesore and has those ticks in speech that were cute in the Seventies but now amount to little more than hiccups laced with mothballs. John Cusack, seen in SHADOWS AND FOG, takes over the writer in this story but doesn't try to act like Allen (a tendency every actor who's subbed for Allen has done since Michael Murphy mirrored Allen in MANHATTAN, Michael Caine did in HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, and so on). Chazz Palmenteri, however, really takes over and drives the movie through and through, being the brains behind the play in production and a thoroughly masculine presence that somehow becomes more and more feminine as the movie walks towards its conclusion. Jennifer Tilly, the moll patterned (at least in the likeness of) Clara Bow, is the bimbo and plays it to the hilt. Dianne Wiest is again on board, this time playing completely against type as a self-absorbed stage actress who throughout the entire movie makes Don't speak! hilarious. A fun ride with a shoot-'em-up finale, this was one of Woody Allen's best films of the Nineties after the Mia scandal, because after this one his movies began a sharp decline in quality and what had been up until then been an anticipated wait -- to see a release of the new Woody Allen film of the year -- had by the end of the Nineties been an Eh... whatever thing.

It seems rather shallow to pigeon-hole someone who after almost ten years of making wacky comedies (and winning an Oscar in the process a year earlier for ANNIE HALL, groundbreaking in every aspect) only wanted to tell the stories he wanted to -- it's the equivalent of the horror writer who gets lambasted when he attempts to write a straight-forward drama, or the dramatic actor who all but gets ruined in the process of effectively conveying comedy.But not to digress INTERIORS is Woody Allen's finest drama which gets better with every subsequent viewing. It's hard not to appreciate the tragedy being played out within its characters nearly thirty years after its first release. It could, as a matter of fact, represent the essential family mechanics without the overwhelming violence that some families enact -- but still inflicting severe wounds of a deeper, mental and emotional nature, the type that years of therapy cannot erase. Three daughters come together to face the burden of their parents' separation (although unlike subsequent movies in which Allen would involve three sisters, i. e. HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, INTERIORS only focuses on two of the three daughters and the third, Flyn, gets an underdeveloped treatment).The aptly named Eve (Geraldine Page) is at the center of this separation. She is the mother who is silently going mad, if she has not been for a while now. It's rather disturbing to see the damage she's inflicted on Renata (Diane Keaton) who herself is involved in a very unsatisfying relationship with a man who cannot appreciate her work as a writer, but more so when we focus on how she treats Joey (Mary Beth Hurt) and imposes her will on her. Joey, the most hurt of the three, has to carry the brunt of this dysfunction, seeing her father's wife-to-be (Maureen Stapelton) who has a natural attitude towards life and could care less about the intellectual pretentiousness these people have.Where Allen really brings forth his forte as a director is right at the moment when everything festering below the surface comes to light, literally. Page's character appears for the first and only time dressed in black, already a ghost, to her daughter Joey who is still clinging onto some hope. As the entire household sleeps (seen in quick inserts), Page decides to walk into the ocean. Joey tries to go after her mother, possibly to save her, possibly to join her. Stapelton, the only one truly awake in the house, runs after Joey and into the water, breathing life into her lungs. It's a powerful, moving scene -- one of the most emotionally satisfying I've ever seen in a Woody Allen movie, since his pictures tend towards the intellectual, and it just shows that a director is much, much more than the sum of his apparent parts, Bergmanesque and all.

MANHATTAN is arguably one of Woody's best romantic comedies and an upbeat one at that despite the usual suspects of dysfunctional individuals who populate the city. The world of Isaac Davis whirls around the love he feels for an underage girl named Tracy, the love he wants to feel for the acerbic Mary Wilke (Diane Keaton), and the love that has turned sour towards his ex-wife turned lesbian Jill (Meryl Strep) who's written a none-too-flattering book based on their marriage (which makes you wonder not only if her lesbianism is merely an excuse to get out of marriage, but how sane she really is but then again tell-all books have as of today become a thing of vague interest; back in 1979, they weren't). The story moves around like a loop-de-loop of relations and it foreshadows a remark that another college girl named Rain (Juliette Lewis), one which another Woody character, Gabe Roth, will date in HUSBANDS AND WIVES, will do in criticism of his work and the fact that characters move in and out of relationships with this casualness that is unnatural. But this is the world he lives in, and in a way, this is pretty much how things actually happen -- we just don't see it this way, or choose not to. To top it all, it has the pristine Gershwin score that makes its presence throughout, it's shot in a crystal clear black and white and the only movie he's done in letterbox, and it has the beautiful, radiant performance from Muriel Hemingway as the precocious Tracy -- her scene, where she gets the bad news from Allen, is shot dead-on and is heartbreaking, but she's the only one who is grounded enough to accept things as they are and look forward.

It's as if they were expecting something and that something didn't deliver, or if it did, they either didn't catch up on it or it did so in an unsatisfying manner. I personally love this movie because of the situation it presents by putting together six people inside a summer home, filling them with the ghost of unrequited love and a secret that seems to be about to burst forth at any given time. Mia Farrow plays Lane, a mousy woman who is spending some time alone to nurse some inner hurts, has been harbouring a love towards Peter (Sam Waterston) who is considering writing a book based on her mother Diane (Elaine Stritch) who has come to visit with her husband Lloyd (Jack Warden). Peter at the same time is finding himself falling for Lane's friend Stephanie (Dianne Weist), while Lane is at the focus of a friend's attention (Denholm Elliott).September has this way of looking like a comedy of manners without the laughs and with a deadline to meet. The thing is, when you place so many people and so much angst together under one roof, it's only time before something unspeakable comes forth -- and in this case, it's the unresolved issues between Diane and Lane who have some truly awful baggage together. Due to the fact that Diane, even when she says she's moved on, is rather insensitive to her daughter, and her daughter is much too sensitive and incapable of moving forward, they seem poised for some serious explosion. It's all very modern-day Shakespearean and while the movie is devoid of any humor (except some witty dialog that only those keen in ear will catch), this could be, in a lighter tone, resemble the sitcom it's about to turn into.

It's as if they were expecting something and that something didn't deliver, or if it did, they either didn't catch up on it or it did so in an unsatisfying manner. I personally love this movie because of the situation it presents by putting together six people inside a summer home, filling them with the ghost of unrequited love and a secret that seems to be about to burst forth at any given time. Mia Farrow plays Lane, a mousy woman who is spending some time alone to nurse some inner hurts, has been harbouring a love towards Peter (Sam Waterston) who is considering writing a book based on her mother Diane (Elaine Stritch) who has come to visit with her husband Lloyd (Jack Warden). Peter at the same time is finding himself falling for Lane's friend Stephanie (Dianne Weist), while Lane is at the focus of a friend's attention (Denholm Elliott).September has this way of looking like a comedy of manners without the laughs and with a deadline to meet. The thing is, when you place so many people and so much angst together under one roof, it's only time before something unspeakable comes forth -- and in this case, it's the unresolved issues between Diane and Lane who have some truly awful baggage together.

I love build-ups to a climactic scene and this movie is pregnant with it -- of course, being screwball, the situation\/premise is way out there on a flimsy limb but who cares? Seeing these two extremely funny women with distinctive comedic styles playing against each other, gravitating towards a final showdown at the Plaza Hotel which delivers on every level, strung along by a plot that just gets crazier and crazier, is really a stroke of genius. I loved this movie, I still do, and truth be damned, I think it's hilarious to the nth degree.
