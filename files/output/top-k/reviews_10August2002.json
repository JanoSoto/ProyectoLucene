Unfortunately, not only did Signs fail to meet these expectations; it was also a very disappointing film, not nearly up to the high standards set by Shyamalan's previous work.Perhaps the most disappointing thing about Signs is its lack of originality. The brilliance of The Sixth Sense and, to a lesser extent, Unbreakable, was the creativity and fresh vision of a new filmmaker who was unencumbered by expectations or commercial pressures.Signs is almost purely derivative.  The directing devise of showing only glimpses of the invading aliens until the climatic scene is right out of Jaws (in which Stephen Spielberg delayed revealing the shark with much greater effect).  The theme of a man who's lost his faith due to a personal tragedy has been dealt with many times -- and with much more subtly and emotion -- than it is here.  The death of Gibson's wife (without giving away too many details) is immediately recognizable as a theft from an episode of Homicide.   And the idea of alien invaders has been seen many times, most recently in Independence Day.Another problem with Signs is the premise itself.  Unlike Independence Day, which had no pretensions to serious drama but developed great characters in the midst of exciting action, Signs takes itself very seriously.  Yet, it's hard to take seriously a bunch of aliens who are so utterly inept that a farmer can lock them in a room and sit in his car the driveway while they try figure a way out.  Despite having the technology to travel across the galaxy to kick some human butt, these aliens sure are stupid.Finally, the writing and direction are just not up to Shyamalan's past standards.  I found no depth or subtly to Gibson's performance--and I am usually a defender of his.  Joaquin Phoenix, who is supposed to be Gibson's dumb jock brother, plays the role with too much intelligence.  One minute he's telling a story of a woman puking at a party, the next he's speaking eloquently about the need for his brother to keep his faith.  Finally, Abilgail Breslin's brilliant performance as Gibson's daughter is overshadowed by a terrible performance by Rory Culkin as Gibson's son.  In Culkin's defense, Shyamalan's script hands him line after line that is just not believable for a child.  Nevertheless, Culkin is not convincing as a serious, sulking young boy.Despite some suspenseful scenes, I found this movie highly disappointing and, at times, almost laughable (particularly the climactic scene).  I hope this is not an indication that Shyamalan may suffer much the same fate as Quentin Tarentino, being unable to live up to his brilliant early work.

Since then, it has grown into a giant marketing juggernaut that has held a firm grip on summer comedies since it's debut.  The original had a small budget, but excelled in its script, which was filled with visual gags and memorable quotes, as well as the predominant Bond spoofs it contained.  The sequel came out two years later, and received a moderately mixed reception. Some were disappointed with it, as they saw the recycling of old gags and the introduction of more bathroom humour.  I, on the other hand, saw it as a worthy sequel that wasn't as good as the original, but could still hold it's own.  Now, we have another sequel that allows the Austin Powers series to become a trilogy, a large honour in franchises.The plot goes like this Dr. Evil has hatched a plan where he will recruit the evil villain Goldmember from 1975, he will kidnap Austin Powers' father in the present and hide him in the 70's, meanwhile, he begins a plan to pull a asteroid into Earth with a tractor beam.  Austin must now team up with his former girlfriend Foxxy Cleopatra to save his father and defeat the evil Dr. Evil.Before you see Goldmember, keep in mind that this movie is a lot sillier and crazier than the previous ones.  Unlike the first two, this one tends to keep its plot a little contained and focus completely on its jokes and gags, many of which are hilarious.  Some scenes are recycled again, but have been turned around so they appear more original (like the objects that looks suggestive on the radar screen').  The celebrity cameos that were used are really hysterical (I'm not going to spoil anything for you, it's much more funny if you don't expect it) and the spoofing in here was nicely done (a little more subtle this time around).   The jokes are what drive this movie, the plot is meaningless as time goes on, and that's one problem.  In the first two, a decent plot was used to back the movie up, in this one; it's a little absent.  One reason for this is the fact that the editing job is a little poor, so as a result, you really can't tell what is going on sometimes (I had to watch it a second time to understand it).See this one for the humour, just leave your brain at the door and enjoy, that's wait this movie is aiming for.  Not as good as the original, about on par with the second one.  To be honest, they should end this series now, Goldmember showed a few signs of franchise fatigue as the movie went on, creating a fourth one would just be milking the series.7\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"10 August 2002","score":"","review":"  Austin Powers started off as a small James Bond-spoofing title back in 1997.

Unlike the first two, this one tends to keep its plot a little contained and focus completely on its jokes and gags, many of which are hilarious.  Some scenes are recycled again, but have been turned around so they appear more original (like the objects that looks suggestive on the radar screen').  The celebrity cameos that were used are really hysterical (I'm not going to spoil anything for you, it's much more funny if you don't expect it) and the spoofing in here was nicely done (a little more subtle this time around).   The jokes are what drive this movie, the plot is meaningless as time goes on, and that's one problem.  In the first two, a decent plot was used to back the movie up, in this one; it's a little absent.  One reason for this is the fact that the editing job is a little poor, so as a result, you really can't tell what is going on sometimes (I had to watch it a second time to understand it).See this one for the humour, just leave your brain at the door and enjoy, that's wait this movie is aiming for.  Not as good as the original, about on par with the second one.  To be honest, they should end this series now, Goldmember showed a few signs of franchise fatigue as the movie went on, creating a fourth one would just be milking the series.7\/10  ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"10 August 2002","score":"","review":"  Austin Powers started off as a small James Bond-spoofing title back in 1997. Since then, it has grown into a giant marketing juggernaut that has held a firm grip on summer comedies since it's debut.  The original had a small budget, but excelled in its script, which was filled with visual gags and memorable quotes, as well as the predominant Bond spoofs it contained.  The sequel came out two years later, and received a moderately mixed reception. Some were disappointed with it, as they saw the recycling of old gags and the introduction of more bathroom humour.  I, on the other hand, saw it as a worthy sequel that wasn't as good as the original, but could still hold it's own.  Now, we have another sequel that allows the Austin Powers series to become a trilogy, a large honour in franchises.The plot goes like this Dr. Evil has hatched a plan where he will recruit the evil villain Goldmember from 1975, he will kidnap Austin Powers' father in the present and hide him in the 70's, meanwhile, he begins a plan to pull a asteroid into Earth with a tractor beam.

Though I'm not sure anything could spoil this movie. -)In a nutshell, Lawrence of Arabia is one of the best movies ever made. I just finished watching it this evening for what seems like the umpth time and still found new things I hadn't seen before in it. While it's not flawless--there are few, if any, great works of art that are, IMHO--it's such an engrossing experience that it creates the illusion only a masterwork of art can create that the viewer isn't merely watching the action, but is immersed in it.One of the primary ways the movie accomplishes this is with its script. It's brilliant. This is regardless of how historically accurate or inaccurate it may be. (One needn't be a witness to events to create a fictionalized account of them for the enjoyment of the public--Shakespeare did it, and so could Lawrence director David Lean.) Robert Bolt's screenplay throws so many curves, and yet they're nearly all warranted. We share with Lawrence his horror and shock when he charges himself with executing a murderer, only to find out it is the same man whom he rescued from death in the desert. We empathize with Lawrence when he finds himself back at the English base in an ill-fitting military uniform, laying it on a bit thick to fit in...when we know he can't. And we nod our heads with Ali when he slams Lawrence for warning him about bloodshed, as Lawrence himself is unfit to do so, judging from his previous actions.It's remarkable. There's nary a line that's not telling, that's not loaded. The dialogue carries the action. It moves it. This is an action movie because it's about action--if the script was lousy, it would be an inaction movie, as it wouldn't lead anywhere. In Lawrence, you believe it. You're with it. This movie's with it.I'd like to cite some of my favorite moments, if I have room. One of them is the aforementioned execution scene--still harrowing as the camera zooms in to show the pitiful face of the man who was saved from death, only to die by Lawrence's hand. Or Auda's There is only the desert for you remark to Lawrence. Or the shock Lawrence and Co. feel when they see the atrocities committed by a Turkish division, only to commit a similar massacre on the fleeing soldiers as retribution...resulting in a reprimand from Ali and the previously insensitive, now disgusted, reporter. And then that flash from his camera...and a cut to a charging man on a horse.The performances are uniformly spectacular. Special note goes to Peter O'Toole, whose Lawrence is complicated, brooding, sarcastic, genuine. Omar Sharif as Ali is just as brooding, and just as good. Sir Alec Guinness gives a mannered, though usually excellent performance. (I think you are one of these desert-loving Englishmen is a standout line.) Jack Hawkins as Gen. Allenby may be somewhat overlooked in this classic cast, but his turn, IMHO, is especially good--gruff, cynical, amused, and perhaps by the end, even somewhat perturbed at his behavior. And of course, Sir Anthony Quayle, Anthony Quinn, Jose Ferrer and the incomparable Claude Rains do fantastic work.The famous score by Maurice Jarre is mostly wonderful (it's a little overwrought, but it works). And the cinematography is stupendous. All these components add up to a wonderful whole that sits next to The Seven Samurai, The Third Man, Rear Window (yes, action-movie guy, I'm including that flick in the list of greats...there's more action that occurs in there through dialogue and editing than in the entire Renny Harlin canon -) ), The Seventh Seal, Ivan the Terrible Parts I and II, Ugetsu Monogatari and a handful of other films as one of the great cinema masterpieces of the world.
