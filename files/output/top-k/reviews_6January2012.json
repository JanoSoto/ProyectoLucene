[{"date":"6 January 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" There are two reasons why I wanted to see this movie one of them was because it is a British black comedy, and because of the nun. Unfortunately the nun, who is really a nurse by day and a stripper by night, isn't a major character in the movie, but her appearances where still pretty cool, and there were plenty of gags around the nun to keep me amused. The movie was good enough to stand on its own anyway, the nun just made it more interesting.Divorcing Jack is a political, conspiracy, black British comedy and very much lived up to my expectations. It is based around a journalist, Don Starky, who invites a young, attractive university student back to his house for a party. Starky is already married, and is not interested in this girl, but she has other ideas and manages to get her wicked way with him. Unfortunately his wife finds him in the act and throws him out and he is forced to move in with the girl. Unfortunately he returns back from getting a Pizza to find that the girl has been murdered, and then accidentally kills her mother because he thinks she is the murder. Even worse, he discovers that the girl was the daughter and the woman the wife, of an Irish politician in fact the treasurer. All of this is happening at a time when elections are being held and peace is being promised by the leading candidate. To add a further twist, the girl's ex-boyfriend is Billy Culgan, a rather nasty bankrobber and IRA soldier who is in gaol. Thus Starky becomes the prime suspect and is caught up in this political game.I guess this movie is about secrets, the truth, and how peace is really only a shallow lie that is used to cover up huge amounts of tension. This movie is a very strong mouthpiece that reports on the violence that is tearing Northern Ireland apart, and Don Starky is the person who controls the mouthpiece. A couple of times he comments of the number of names that Northern Ireland has because of the number of people that are competing over control of this small state the British and the Irish, the Protestants and the Catholics. The Irish want freedom from the British, but under that there is a huge religious tension that is constantly ripping the country apart - and every time a peace plan comes along, it is only shortlived before something happens which rips the country apart again. It is interesting to note that Scotland and Wales are gaining their own parliaments now.The religious violence is interesting because people attack religion claiming that it is the major causes of wars. This I disagree with - it might be an excuse for a war but it generally is not the cause of a war. In this situation, it seems that the whole reason behind the Protestant - Catholic violence in Northern Ireland has been forgotten and they simply fight because they hate each other. I believe the reason stemmed back to the protestants being English and because the Irish hated the English they remained Catholic - but I can only gather this from the history books.Divorcing Jack is a very good movie about the pointlessness of violence, the lies and conspiracies that run riot through areas of unrest and giving us the idea that peace in Ireland is not just around the corner - it is built on centuries of prejudice and hatred and can't simply be solved by one smiling man.

They returned, but in Mallrats and Chasing Amy, before this movie was made. I guess Kevin Smith wanted a few more films under his belt before he tackled a film like this, considering that it is probably his biggest budget film made to date.At the beginning of the movie, he tells people not to take this film too seriously, including the critics, and that God has a sense of humour so instead of calling it down in flames, just enjoy it. Even though, this comment at the beginning did not stop the Catholic Church from petitioning Disney to not release it, and from the film makers receiving lots of hate mail. Kevin Smith wasn't too worried as he then published the letters on the internet.This movie is mainly about belief and the substance of it. I do disagree with his conclusion that faith is malleable and that it doesn't matter what you believe but as long as you believe then it is okay. Personally, just because I believe with my whole heart that the plane I am going to get into will not fall out of the sky, it doesn't mean that the plane won't fall out of the sky. In the end, this is probably the most heretical thing because it deceives us into thinking that we don't have to submit to God's rule and can save ourselves. Personally, if you wanted to be offensive, you should have gone the whole way and said that Jesus is the only way to God.What it does say, which is probably far more offensive to some traditionalists, is that Jesus had a thirteenth disciple that was black, and that Jesus himself was Black. It also suggests that God is a woman, only to say at the end that God in fact has no sex (which I don't necessarily disagree with). Then we had Allanis Morrisette come out, acting all joyful and giggly. He also said that Mary had other children after Christ, and in fact it is highly unlikely that Joseph would not have hung around if he wasn't getting any sex - which I thought was actually quite a cool argument against the Catholic belief that Mary remained a virgin.The movie itself is about two angels who were kicked out of heaven because one got too drunk and convinced the angel of death to give up his job. They then discovered a loophole to get back into heaven, and unfortunately that means that if they do so then God is fallible and thus entire existence vanishes for existence rests on the fact that God is infallible. The reason that the loophole exists is because the Catholics created all of the traditions which God has to hold (not true, and the biblical reference is taken out of context as well), and thus the angels are using this tradition to get back.Even though I do make some criticisms, Kevin Smith does clearly outline at the beginning that this is a movie and that it has been written for a laugh. Even then Kevin Smith does put a lot of ideas into his movies, and from watching them we can see some of the things that he wishes to say. It was true in Clerks and other such movies, and it is the same here.I guess in the end, this movie is a good movie (in fact it is my favourite Kevin Smith movie), but it falls back on some of the practical aspects. Kevin Smith is a brilliant writer, but his directorial skills are not the best. Some suggest that maybe he should stick with being a writer, or maybe work with some other directors, but whatever the suggestion, the truth is that Kevin Smith is very talented, and we hope that this isn't his last movie.

","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy"},{"date":"6 January 2012","score":"","review":" Generally I do not like biographical movies, and I wondered what could be so exciting about Bruce Lee's life. I would probably be lynched by saying that, but I am one that does say things that offend people such as Jesus being the only way to heaven. As far as I knew Bruce Lee was simply a Hong Kong actor, but after watching this movie I realised how wrong I was.The opening scene has Bruce Lee enter into dance hall when some Asians are being picked on by some sailors (with Australian accents) and he beats them up. This scene runs very much like a Hong Kong fight scene without the finese. It is trying to hard to be like a Hong Kong movie here. Even with this shortcoming, the film doesn't unfold like this. Now I cannot say how much I know about Lee's life, but after watching this film, I know a bit more.There are three themes in Dragon. The one that I see the most is Lee's struggle with white man. This ties in with another theme and that is facing one's fear. Fear in this movie manifests itself as a powerful Oriental Knight that is almost unbeatable, and even though I don't know that much about Oriental Mysticism, I feel that these demon scenes are over glorified. As you watch the movie, one begins to see how much Lee struggled trying to be accepted by white people. He goes to America with dreams in his eyes, and leaves disillusioned, after being denied by his own people to teach them their arts, and by being betrayed by other people, such as Hollywood, who took his Kungfu idea and gave it to another man. He also learnt what discrimination was, hatred simply because you were slightly different. Yet he did find comfort in a woman, an Anglo woman, who loved him for who is was, and this movie is actually told through her mouth, as it was based on her biography.I don't think Lee had that much of a hard life. He rubbed a few people up the wrong way, but he took chances and managed to pull himself through. He listened to his wife and opened up a Dojo to teach his forms of martial arts, and he defied his people by teaching it to the white and black man. It is interesting how he bonds with the Negro who first walked into his Dojo, and we see this bonding especially before he goes to fight the Asian, for it seems that the Negro has made Lee one of his own.The other theme was Bruce's desire to please his father. His father sent him away from Hong Kong because of a curse, and the weight always on his mind was that he had to let his father know that he had succeeded. When his father had died he had only made a dent, but it was that one trip back to Hong Kong that made him a filmstar. Yet his father said that Hong Kong would kill him, and even though he defeated his demon, the movie claims that he died after falling into an unknown coma. There are a lot of rumours around about how Lee died, but I am not willing to commit to one, and neither was the movie. As the narrator says at the end, they don't think about how he died, but rather how he lived. All I can say is that is important because decisions made in life can effect you when you are dead.

","genre":"Action, Biography, Drama"},{"date":"6 January 2012","score":"","review":" This is a very clever movie. It is not one that would go down as a classic movie, but it is still very clever and somewhat original. On one hand the movie is about the teenage desire to be free and be able to do what they want all through summer. On the other hand it is about a group of kids who are rudely thrust into the adult world and suddenly discover that life isn't the party that they expected it to be. The mother of five children is going on a holiday to Australia during summer. The kids expect that they will look after themselves, but what they don't know is that their mother hired a babysitter. From the first instances in the movie we see that the kids are lazy, insolent, and generally don't care about anything and are not willing to help. The babysitter on the other hand is incredibly totalitarian and forces the kids into line. That is until she see Kenneth's room and dies of a heart attack because of it. The children think that this is great until they realise they have no money. The Babysitter had the money on her when they dumped her at the morgue, and thus they have no food and no money for the two months that their mother is away. The solution is that Sue-ellen or Kenneth get a job. Sue-Ellen looses the toss and must work. After working at a Clown Dog restaurant and hating it, Sue-Ellen makes up a resume and gets a job as an Executive Assistant to the Vice-President at a uniform design company. What starts off as a thrill for Sue-Ellen suddenly pushes her into the world of adulthood. She must deal with jealous employees of whose job she stole and fend of the sleazy advances of a co-worker named Gus. I guess we can delve deep into what happens in the plot because there is always something happening. Sue-Ellen, who is the main character, is not only trying to cope in an adult world with a naive attitude, but she is also trying to hold onto a boyfriend while trying to hide the fact that she is masquerading as a 28 year old, and the fact that the receptionist who hates Sue-Ellen is the guy's sister does not help. What we see though is how the characters grow. Sue-Ellen begins to discover what it is like to be a mother. Her mother knows that her children steal cash from her, but Sue-Ellen, in her naivety, does not expect this and is ripped off over three thousand dollars. The house becomes more messier as the trash piles up while the kids do nothing. Kenneth, who spends his time getting stoned with his friends, is also slowly thrust into adulthood, and quite reluctantly at that. It is only when they are faced with a long time in gaol that they begin to rise above what they were. By the end we see that Sue-Ellen, who wanted to waste the summer away on the beach, has now come to understand what life is really about and has made her decisions while Kenneth realises that school is not a bludge and that his results are important. He goes from a messy druggie to a respectable gentleman who ends up with a woman that he could never have. The final scene is clever with their mother returning home to a party, but not any sort of party. The cliché is that parents walk in on a wild drug party where the music is loud and people are drunk and behaving like hooligans. In this movie the party is very sophisticated with many respectable people and a lot of money floating around. Though quite shocked at what is actually going on, it is still a party. Yet we discover that Sue-Ellen's and Kenneth's attitude to their mother has changed. In the end, it seems that everybody has forgotten that the babysitter ever was there, including the audience. Favourite Quote She was the best friend that I ever had. You never even knew her. Yes, but she left us all of her money.

She must deal with jealous employees of whose job she stole and fend of the sleazy advances of a co-worker named Gus. I guess we can delve deep into what happens in the plot because there is always something happening. Sue-Ellen, who is the main character, is not only trying to cope in an adult world with a naive attitude, but she is also trying to hold onto a boyfriend while trying to hide the fact that she is masquerading as a 28 year old, and the fact that the receptionist who hates Sue-Ellen is the guy's sister does not help. What we see though is how the characters grow. Sue-Ellen begins to discover what it is like to be a mother. Her mother knows that her children steal cash from her, but Sue-Ellen, in her naivety, does not expect this and is ripped off over three thousand dollars. The house becomes more messier as the trash piles up while the kids do nothing. Kenneth, who spends his time getting stoned with his friends, is also slowly thrust into adulthood, and quite reluctantly at that. It is only when they are faced with a long time in gaol that they begin to rise above what they were. By the end we see that Sue-Ellen, who wanted to waste the summer away on the beach, has now come to understand what life is really about and has made her decisions while Kenneth realises that school is not a bludge and that his results are important. He goes from a messy druggie to a respectable gentleman who ends up with a woman that he could never have. The final scene is clever with their mother returning home to a party, but not any sort of party. The cliché is that parents walk in on a wild drug party where the music is loud and people are drunk and behaving like hooligans. In this movie the party is very sophisticated with many respectable people and a lot of money floating around. Though quite shocked at what is actually going on, it is still a party. Yet we discover that Sue-Ellen's and Kenneth's attitude to their mother has changed. In the end, it seems that everybody has forgotten that the babysitter ever was there, including the audience.

On one hand the movie is about the teenage desire to be free and be able to do what they want all through summer. On the other hand it is about a group of kids who are rudely thrust into the adult world and suddenly discover that life isn't the party that they expected it to be. The mother of five children is going on a holiday to Australia during summer. The kids expect that they will look after themselves, but what they don't know is that their mother hired a babysitter. From the first instances in the movie we see that the kids are lazy, insolent, and generally don't care about anything and are not willing to help. The babysitter on the other hand is incredibly totalitarian and forces the kids into line. That is until she see Kenneth's room and dies of a heart attack because of it. The children think that this is great until they realise they have no money. The Babysitter had the money on her when they dumped her at the morgue, and thus they have no food and no money for the two months that their mother is away. The solution is that Sue-ellen or Kenneth get a job. Sue-Ellen looses the toss and must work.

Personally that is a question that I do not know the answer too and in a sense probably can never know the answer too, though I do know that this book, written amongst the beat generation as an attack upon government, has now become required reading in highschool (I believe, though I know that I read this book when I was in highschool). I guess one of the reasons is that while this book is now a very popular book, it looks back at a time that we do not know and cannot remember, and thus in a sense sanitises the message. In fact there are a lot of books that are now on our reading list in which the writer, at the time, was considered a reactionary against the status quo, and in some cases, found themselves locked up as political prisoners. It is not until years after their death that the true literary genius of the work becomes appreciated.As for the film, I must admit that it simply does not impress me in the same way that the book does. In fact it is a very rare incident where the film is as good as, or even better, than the book. The rare case would be where the book was utter rubbish, but a film maker comes along, who actually likes the book, and is able to create out of the book a film that encompasses what the film maker likes about the book. While that does not necessarily hold true in this case (the book is far better than the film) I do feel that this is what Milos Foreman has attempted to do here, that is try to capture the essence of the book in a new media.For those have seen the film but have not read the book then I would encourage you to do so. I do feel that he does try to capture the essence, however there are numerous aspects that would be very hard to do, such as getting into the chief's mind, and even trying to bring out his paranoid schizophrenia. In the book the Chief is the main character, however the main character in the film is McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), and while the Chief plays an important role, he is not necessarily the central figure.Like the book, the film focuses on the conflict between McMurphy and Nurse Ratchett, however I noticed that in the film, Ratchett seems to always hold all the cards, and McMurphy tries, and fails, to beat her. This differs from the book where it is clear that McMurphy seems to always have the upperhand, namely because he is a central figure among the patients on the ward. He is their leader, their messiah, the one who opens them up and makes them feel confident with themselves. Further, in the book, there is actually quite a high bodycount, one which Ratchett tries, but fails, to pin on McMurphy. In the film only Billy Bibbit dies, and when McMurphy responds in the way that he does, it does not seem to have the same impact. The book is clear in that after McMurphy busts Ratchett's vocal chords, she does not have the same hold over the ward as she did previously, and moreso, there is the scene where McMurphy literally defrocks her (though it is still a metaphorical sense in which he rips off her clothes) which further emasculates here. She is never the same again afterwards, but this is not the same in the film. It is clear that Ratchett still retains her sense of dignity, and it is clear (as opposed to the book) that it is McMurphy that has been emasculated.Finally, I wish to suggest that in the film we have less sympathy for the patients than we do in the book. Throughout the film they are fighting and bickering amongst each other, and both Ratchett and McMurphy sit back to watch them go at each others throats. Obviously there is Ratchett as judge, jury, and executioner, with no appeal allow, and this is similar in the book, but in the book McMurphy does take control of the meetings, and the ward, over that of Ratchett, and every time Ratchett believes she has wrenched the ward back from him, McMurphy has pulled the rug out from underneath here. This is in particular with the Doctor, whom McMurphy builds a good relationship with, while in the film, the Doctor is clearly on Ratchett's side, meaning that one weapon that McMurphy clearly has in the book, has been blunted in the film.Don't get me wrong, this is a good film, but the more I think about it, the more that I come to realise that what has happened is that a popular, and well written book, has one again been blunted by the Hollywood machine to create a scene that is more palpable to the powers that be. While books are much less expensive to write, and require a lot less investment (even more so in the days of the internet), there are numerous authorities that need to be pleased for a film to be released. It is only where the film is produced outside of the American mainstream (and even the tremendous amounts of funding are still required) that the standard is relaxed, and we are able to see films that challenge the status quo.

Like I said, I liked this movie, but it wasn't just the story itself that sold me on it; it was the actors, as well. Anna Massey is great as Helen, the lead female role, and Moira Shearer used some of her interesting dancing skills in a good way for a specific scene in her role as Vivian. But, all in all, it's Karlheinz Bohm that really sells it here. He is insane, but he's kind of like the tragic figure in a story. It is a really great performance.All in all, a great 60's horror film. I can kind of see why people would have been so disgusted back then, but I can't judge based on what people thought back then; I can only judge based on my own thoughts. And, in my own thoughts, I thought to myself, No wonder the scene where he almost kills the blind woman is on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments. It really is a well-shot scene. Overall, it is a frightening, systematic view at the behaviour of a murderer, and a timeless masterpiece of horror movies. A 9\/10 for me.

In fact, it is quite a low fantasy movie with the exception of the dragon, which creates some of the high fantasy in this movie. Straight out, it is an enjoyable movie to watch, but it goes little beyond that.A knight is training a prince in the art of honour and chivalry, but the prince has better ideas. When he sees his father wounded severely in a peasant uprising, he does not help him, but rather rips the crown from his hand. It is this event that shows us that the prince is, in his heart, evil. Unfortunately, when his is wounded, he is taken to a Dragon for help. The dragon gives him half of his heart and the boy survives. Unfortunately, all pain that the prince (now King) feels is felt by the dragon. The king does not change his ways, and the knight thus blames the dragon.The movie hasn't got a straight plot, but it isn't twisted either. What it focuses on is the knight, who first seeks to kill the dragon, then befriends him, and then decides to destroy the king's power, only to become king himself. The movie does have a tragic feel to it, as we soon come to know that the dragon is going to die because of his compassion, but it is not the tragedy where we can see the character constantly degrade to a point where he will die. In fact, even though we know he is going to die, it is not because of his actions, but because of the actions of the antagonist, and though we see a minor flag that an act of compassion at the beginning will lead to his downfall, we do not know enough to want to warn him away from doing it.The theology in the movie is quite dodgy as well. Though human theology is not looked at, dragon theology is. The way the dragon reaches heaven is my doing noteworthy and honourable deeds. Unfortunately, if those deeds backfire then the dragon is in big trouble. As such there is no certainty and as such we can be as good as we like, but never be guaranteed because our acts of goodness might backfire.What Christ offers is assurance. There is no being good because no amount of good deeds can get us on the right side of God. In fact by doing pure good deeds we are saying that we are not happy with the way God does things and want to do it ourselves, and thus offending God. As such it is a vicious circle for we attempt to be good, but by being good we are being offensive, which is bad. As such being good does not work, but rather by trusting what God has already done. By dying he has given us the option of accepting that our goodness will never be good enough and thus take Jesus' goodness for ourselves, and his resurrection tells us that he had the authority to do it.As for the movie, it is okay, and pleasant to watch as a fantasy movie, but beyond that it is really not all that much.

I remember the film well for two reasons. One was because I was on a date with Cindy, whom I liked a lot. The second reason was because I felt sorry for the film's hapless husband, Clovis Poplin, quite ably brought to life by William Atherton.Thirty seven years later I still see the film from time to time. I can't say the same thing about Cindy. I have absolutely no idea whatsoever what happened to Cindy. Hopefully only good things because she was, and hopefully still is, a very special person. The movie showed up on cable the other night so I watched it yet again. I still enjoy the movie, but for different reasons than I did back when I was learning how to think. Atherton is effective as the husband who loves his wife so much that he is willing to do anything for her, including getting shot. And Goldie Hawn is equally successful in portraying the wife who can no longer distinguish fantasy from fact, or need from want.Atherton's character, a good old kind of guy who isn't the shiniest bulb in the box is inspired by the life of Robert Dent. His wife, Lou Jean Poplin, inspired by the very real Ila Fae Holiday, is trashy in a cute sort of way and has an overwhelming desire to get back her baby from foster parents. Lou Jean masterminds Clovis' escape from prison, and then commence to reclaim their baby.During their escape, the lovebirds carjack an old, cranky couple, and later kidnap Texas trooper Maxwell Slide, believably played by Michael Sacks, and steal his patrol vehicle. The character is based on the life of Texas Department of Safety Patrolman John Kenneth Crone. Coordinating the ensuing police pursuit is the life weathered and compassionate Captain Harlin Tanner, effectively dramatized by Academy Award winner Ben Johnson of The Last Picture Show fame.As a retired police officer, I tend to judge critically the accuracy of films regarding police procedures. I don't know how much of the police work portrayed in this film really happened, but I hope not much. The police pursuit in this case involved at least 100 police cars, all with their lights and sirens on, many which crashed, often into each other. People lined up along the road to watch the chase as news media hovered about ground. As the happy couple drives through one particular town they are celebrated as heroes. In another town they are the target of a reckless vigilante ambush that doesn't succeed.Trooper Slide has 9 months on the job. His actions are not, shall we say, text book, and his conduct surely suggests that he was not ready to do police work on his own. So let's give everyone the benefit of the doubt and say the lapses were based on cinematic license.This was Director Steven Spielberg's first theatrically released film. Prior to the Sugarland Express, he had directed the made for TV movie, Duel, an effective drama involving a trucker versus a road salesman. I like action as much as the next guy. Really. But the pursuits portrayed in Sugarland Express are ludicrous. I would have preferred watching less pursuits and delving with more depth into the lives of the people involved. Cindy and I probably enjoyed watching the pursuits when we saw the film in the theater. Of course, I wasn't such a brilliant analyst of police procedures back then, or the lover of thoughtful biographies.According to the Texas Monthly, in real life Crone worked for a few more years for DPS, and then went on to become a director of security for the U.S. Department of Energy. He died February 10, 2011. Holiday was sentenced to five years in state prison, did 5 months, and cared for her mother and children.

Two things to say First, this would have been a Don Bluth Studios production, nobody would have never shouted at it. The Black Cauldron do not follow the Disney philosophy at all and we almost all agree on that point. This movie is dark on its overall at a point that we can barely think it is targeting a very young audience. Dark movies were certainly a trend in the 80's, The Dark Crystal or Legend are very good examples of how this ambiance was present and used into the movie industry at that period of time.Second, the movie is not bad at all! Try to see it from a different perspective. Animation is just a piece of art and at first glance we can easily guess this is a Disney. Characters are nicely drawn, the princess is very cute, Taran is a teenager full of energy and willing to do well....the villain is freaking frightening, probably the most scary Disney villain of all times! But it is true something is weak in this movie  the plot and roles of some of the characters. What is the one of Helowny for example? Apart bringing the required cute female presence in the story what does she add? Giving advice or supporting Taran in his quest? More drama would have been created if she was the one to jump into the Cauldron! Taran and Helowny both feel attraction for each other...the movie is dark enough to let the cute princess die bringing the dramatization level a notch up (and bring her back to life for the happy ending).

What I considered a shame though was that the filmmakers never actually went on to make a third movie where Conan becomes king. I am not familiar with the original Conan stories, having never read one, but I suspect that the filmmakers did refer to the books when making these films, and I suspect that the books also chronicle on Conan becoming a king, though as I said, I have not read any of the books so I cannot comment.While not having the same epic quality that the original film has, I still enjoy this film. Rather than having the scope of the first film, where much of the film is narrated as we follow Conan in his desire to revenge the murder of his village, this film really only deals with a single adventure that Conan has after defeating the snake cult (though the only reference to the previous film is to Conan's beloved, and this is played out by the antagonist who promises to bring Conan's beloved back to life in return for his services).The interesting thing is that the more recent Conan movie seems to have elements of both of these films in it, namely with regards to the woman that Conan protects. In this film the woman is a young noble who will be sacrificed to allow a god to return to Hyboria. In the later movie she was to be a conduit through which the antagonist could resurrect his dead wife. However, as mentioned a few times, the newer movie pales in comparison to the original ones. In this one they must go on a quest to retrieve some objects, however the girl is meant to remain a virgin (something that is excluded from the later movie). This would have been a problem, except that Conan's heart belongs to somebody else, and this somebody else is dead, so we notice that Conan is constantly rebuffing the girl's advances.I do enjoy this film, and would watch it again, particularly since I like the wizard. In the first movie he only carries the name wizard, but here we learn that he does have a name, Akiro. I would have preferred it if he had simply retained the title 'the Wizard' since it would have added a lot more mystery to the character, but this film, as mentioned a few times, is not the original film, and simply seems to be an excuse to cash in on the limited success of the original.

Perhaps the real problem though is the misguided attempts to liven it up. Director Martin Scorsese, best known for his snappy crime flicks, seems unable to allow his style to take a step back for a more sedate story.The Age of Innocence is, from start to finish, essentially one long parade of fancy camera-work. The second scene features a lengthy tracking shot, floating gracefully from one character to the next as a voice-over reads an extract from the novel. It's all expertly done, but it's too artificial, shows too much of the mind behind the camera. At other times he is even more overt. What should have been the most poignant moment is spoiled by a series of quick edits to an earlier scene, spelling out the significance and puncturing the emotion. I don't see why Edith Wharton's novel deserves such treatment &#x96; it's a good enough story without such gilding. Scorsese was of course set to direct Schindler's List that year, before handing over control to Steven Spielberg. I shudder to think what he might have done to that movie.It's a pity Scorsese chose to be so ostentatious for The Age of Innocence, all the more so because there are a lot of nice things going on here. The art direction is a gorgeous mass of flowers, paintings and assorted fripperies, dominating every set to an extent that is almost surreal. The cast is a treat too. The role of Newland Archer doesn't tease the best out of Daniel Day-Lewis, but he manages it well, with pursed lips conveying his stifled emotions. Michelle Pfeiffer is exceptional in one crucial scene, venting anger without going over-the-top, leading neatly into her first kiss with Day-Lewis. Winona Ryder's performance works really well in a bright innocence totally free of cliché. It's also wonderful to see piquant British players Miriam Margolyes and Michael Gough.But overall, this picture is just too gimmicky for such things to shine through. The spoken-word extracts from the novel seem not so much to move the plot along but to plug holes in the narrative. Then there is the clunky device of having letters read out, to-camera, by the characters who wrote them. Such cheap tricks divorce the movie from the story's world.

Many top critics have condemned this film like it was absolutely a waste of time. In my opinion, this film was worth the hour and half. The director of this film, George P. Cosmatos has been ridiculed for making some of the most mediocre films in cinema history. Well better mediocre than terrible! Leviathan isn't even really that bad as critics say it is. This movie has a really good cast and the special effects make it even more enjoyable.The cast of this film has actors from various genres. Peter Weller, Amanda Pays, Ernie Hudson, Richard Crenna, and Daniel Stern to name a few. Even though this film is sci-fi part horror, there are so parts of comedy under the mesh of genres. Same thing goes for Cosmatos' film Cobra (1986); a serious movie with some comedic moments. Weller and Hudson are fun to listen to. Mostly these two actors have all the fun lines to say. Amanda Pays is nice to watch too, mostly because people enjoy the scenes where she has barely any clothes on. For me though it's her accent and her eyes. She just has a very innocent character and she does it well. Even though the cast is not massive, I don't want to give away all the character's personalities. The viewer will be able to figure it out when they watch the movie.The effects are the second best thing in this movie. Stan Winston who also did a series of other amazing creature effects in previous movies such as Alien (1979) provides the creature effects. For any horror fan that doesn't like things that squirm and wiggle, this will be a good movie to see. The only issue I had was how the characters were picked off. What I mean is how much gore was involved. Although this movie was rated R, it is mostly for language and some blood. There is blood but I felt that there could've been more. Either way it works well in creating tension. Jerry Goldsmith who I think did a great job composed the music in this movie. Never have a heard a movie soundtrack that has whale sounds in it; it's very eerie.Finally what I like most about this movie was the whole idea. I don't really understand why but 1989 was year that underwater thrillers were the up and up. Along with Leviathan was Deepstar Six (1989) and The Abyss (1989). All three of these didn't really fair well but I feel that this one is the best, even though Cameron's Abyss is now the most famous. But the creature in this movie is like a hybrid of Alien (1979), and John Carpenter's The Thing (1982). Just like The Thing (1982), this movie uses flame-throwers and they look a whole lot meaner too! To some, this film is a cheap knock-off. This is not cheap knock-off, it is a well done knock-off. It has good effects and nice cast to back it up. It hurts to hear people scorn this film, all it is a mixture of previous ideas.With the suspense from The Abyss (1989), the setting from Alien (1979), and a creature like The Thing (1982), Leviathan is a true knock-off.

Just like The Thing (1982), this movie uses flame-throwers and they look a whole lot meaner too! To some, this film is a cheap knock-off. This is not cheap knock-off, it is a well done knock-off. It has good effects and nice cast to back it up. It hurts to hear people scorn this film, all it is a mixture of previous ideas.With the suspense from The Abyss (1989), the setting from Alien (1979), and a creature like The Thing (1982), Leviathan is a true knock-off. But what makes it better than other knock-offs is its distinguished cast, exceptional special effects and a murky soundtrack.

I haven't seen the picture since then until tonight, and even though it's twenty years later I'm still blown away by the special effects of the picture. The liquid metal alloy concept of Robert Patrick's T-1000 makes for a lot of clever mutations, with each one outdoing the one that went before. The one that really got me was when he rose out of the black and white tile floor of the hospital corridor. Very cool.Story wise, I always have a little trouble with these time travel gimmicks. It seems to me that Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) understood the unintended consequences of his work with Cyberdyne, and the science that came out of the remnants of the 1984 Terminator were handily disposed of at the finale. So Arnold and Company effectively saved the present day AND the future, except that the future happened anyway. I may be missing something here, but I'm not going to dwell on it.What I probably like most about the story is the relentless nature of the T-1000 to complete his mission, and the equal resolve that the Cyberdyne Systems Model 101 (that would be Arnie) has to stop him. Schwarzenegger once again parlayed his ability to deliver just a single line that has since become iconic - Hasta la vista, Baby, getting by the rest of the way with his huge physique and a singular scowl. To her credit, Linda Hamilton literally got in shape for this picture by getting totally buffed, making her action sequences that much more believable. I'd probably be remiss if I didn't mention Edward Furlong for his portrayal as the young John Connor. I didn't really care for him at the start of the picture, but he grew into the role as the story progressed, becoming a sympathetic character by the time it was over.

There are so many disastrous problems with this film that it's impossible to list them all. Suffice it to say that I've never seen such amateur acting since watching my last NYU student film. And the writing was so cliché-ridden, that the screenwriter, at the very minimum, should be barred from the Writers Guild for the remainder of his professional life. As far as the fatal flaws in the casting of this turkey went, let begin with poor old Burt Lancaster -- his character, an oil tycoon with a pathological fixation on astrology and the stars.

Then, to see this once mega star lowering himself to his final scene, spending one Scotch-infused night with The World's Oldest Living Beach Bum, emerging the next morning to tell his shell shocked cohorts in crime that he has suddenly changed his mind about building a gigantic oil refinery worth billions of dollars to his company, and now wanted to build a planetarium and oceanographic institute there instead?

Set in Boston, Mass, it deals will many issues that I found prevalent in that city when I was growing up 40 years ago. Everyone, rich or poor, wants to be smaaart in Boston. No one wants to be a fucking moron. So, here you have everyone's secret fantasy brought to life, especially if you are a southie from the poor part of town. And that fantasy is to be able to outsmart the MIT and Harvard boys. Will Hunting does just that, and the fact that he is a janitor at esteemed MIT only serves to further illustrate the class conflicts that only his prodigious talent can penetrate and overcome. Now I think that many people watching this film did not find Will's character to be believable. But Will is first of all a Boston native and so I believe that the movie is somewhat autobiographical or at least the expression of a fantasy of his. This makes the movie work for me as he is able to be himself with all of its contradictions - angry and foul mouthed but also smart and wanting the world to know it. He embodies well the Boston I remember with all of its class tensions. Intellectuals hold a place of great respect there, but they also can be resented and envied. That resentment is what fuels Will's ambition and gives the movie a sense of believability. Could this happen in real life? - sure, but only if the gift is toned down somewhat. Yeah, but thats Hollywood and you have to expect that his talent would be trumped up a bit.Anyway, so I enjoyed this movie on many levels. In particular I loved Minnie Driver and believe that without her, things could have fallen apart very easily. I don't think her relationship with Will was awkward or forced. Smart girls often fall for less fortunate guys. This was one of the more satisfying relationships in a movie I have seen in quite a while. And Robin Williams puts in a strong performance although if you are from Boston you know he's no southie. He is, though, a little like Popeye the sailor man - still a force to be reckoned with. Did he and Will have to bond over fart humor though? Seems they could have worked on that a bit...But Good Will hunting is overall a well written, thought provoking drama that explores a lot of issues and relationships surrounding class, career ambitions, personal triumph and tragedy. No one escapes unharmed and there are no gods in the end. The fortunate are humbled, and Will can never escape his past. This is Boston. Here we end up with a compromise of sorts where several individuals from completely different backgrounds teach each other a few things about life and grow as a result. Now if you had told me the storyline before I saw the movie, I would have been dubious that it could work. But because you had two up and coming, talented individuals writing and acting from the heart, a sensitive director, some good music and nice city shots, this is a movie I would watch again for sure.
