[{"date":"25 June 2013","score":"","review":" Alexander Payne's second feature is a hilarious, over the top, but somehow strangely acute, intimate, and honest film about politics. However it takes place in a high school, but that's certainly not who the satirical jabs are aimed at. The brilliance of Payne's work is how he is able to place a political message into such a bizarre context such as high school. Having Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon as the leads doesn't hinder things either. There is a youthful, kinetic energy about this movie that is refreshingly original, if a bit overplayed at times. Certainly we can see the development of Alexander Payne's satirical intimacy and humorous outtake on human behavior. Perhaps not the best of the director, but a worthwhile stop.
