This was the film that pushed 007 over-the-top and is rightly considered a classic. It's very iconic of mid-60's cinema -- the title song, the gold-painted woman, Oddjob's deadly hat and the breaking into Fort Knox. Despite this, the next two films in the series are actually better -- Thunderball (1965) and You Only Live Twice (1967). Thunderball made more at the box office than any other Bond flick from the Connery era and You Only Live Twice upped the ante with the action & spy stuff and is just more all-around entertaining.Yet Goldfinger continues to be the Bond film that's most highly regarded of the 60s and this should be respected. But don't expect the wall-to-wall action that was introduced with You Only Live Twice and remains to this day. Yes, Goldfinger has some quality action sequences, but far less than what you'd typically get from a Bond flick post-Thunderball. In fact, one clash in the film is a simple game of golf between James and Goldfinger. An earlier scene involves Bond forcing Goldfinger to lose a card game. This doesn't make Goldfinger bad, of course, just different.Other positives include a fairly long sequence in the magnificent Swiss Alps, where it was shot, and quality Bond babes like Shirley Eaton and brief appearances by Margaret Nolan and Nadja Regin; Honor Blackman is also cool as Pussy Galore, but she never tripped my trigger.Despite all the good, there are some negatives. For instance, the gas fly-over by Pussy Galore's girls and the falling-over of the troops comes off very lame. There's also too much down time that's not all that interesting.BOTTOM LINE Goldfinger is a James Bond classic, full of iconic imagery and scenes. When it was released it was truly extraordinary, but it now seems kind of tame and sometimes even lame. Regardless, it's definitely a worthy Bond flick and has it's own unique charm.The film runs 110 minutes.GRADE B ","genre":null},{"date":"2 October 2013","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Released in 1964 (or January, 1965, in the USA), Goldfinger was the third Bond film in three years.

I think that they are a blast! A lot of people say that he is 'wooden', but I just think he pulls it off as being very cool. Not all actors in his category can do that and really DO look wooden (cough... Steven Seagal, cough...)With that said... unfortunately, in my lowly and wretched opinion as opposed to several reviewers here, I truly do NOT think that this is one of the better Van Damme films.

I am a student of US History and Politics. I have studied the Vietnam war for years. I have quoted this film, talked about it with many people and yet now I am not so sure I have ever watched it until this very day. How bizarre? But it also shows just how embedded this film is into our very culture, the very definition of a classic. How many of us could poke fun or recreate a scene from this iconic film having never seen it? Now the thing is this film was either brilliant or a steaming pile of crap or something in the middle. However, after reading some other reviews I think we all feel this way. I felt like the final closing scenes of Apocalypse Now were just freaking brilliant. It had one of the most ominous, dark, disturbing, twisted ambiances I had ever seen in a film. It was really interesting to read about the incredible issues Coppola had with Brando because it ended up being breathtaking. But really the whole film is that way. It is dark and twisted and often sickening and I don't think I understand a lick of it because from square one you start to lose your own sanity and just go deeper and deeper into sheer madness. In this way the film is brilliant. Entertaining? Somehow no. I mean the film is excessive in everything and so much of it leaves you with a furrowed brow wondering what is happening.You cannot deny Martin Sheen's intensity in this film. He gives a subtle, brooding and disturbing performance. His quiet, steady, deep voice narrating much of the film gives it at least most of its power. Honestly, everyone else that rides the boat with him down the Nang river left zero impression on me. I could hardly tell you the difference between them and their characters are left completely undeveloped and you just know they are there but not much else. This is especially the case when you have such terrific small cameos from iconic actors, some of whom were just starting out. Robert Duvall was brilliant at being complex, insane and basically making no sense at all but in the context of this bizarre film. He delivers one of the most iconic movie lines of all time I love the smell of Napalm in the morning, and makes your eyes wide with how insane he comes across. Dennis Hopper is equally as good and disturbing as photo-journalist who clearly has lost his grip on reality. Hopper's fast talking, neuroses is really fascinating. I think the only thing I have seen Marlon Brando in are films that he small cameos in. I knew the film was leading up to him because everyone knows his infamous role in the movie. He is a powerful force on screen and certainly his charisma makes you take notice of him. I wouldn't say he was amazing in the part but somehow he has become iconic in the role and there is just something magical about his performance so he lucked out in that way.I would certainly never begin to bash Francis Ford Coppola on his film making abilities. The man is a god to the film making community. There is absolutely no denying his style in this film and I would guess that every decision, every shot, every character, every odd thing you see was planned by him to make a statement. If there was ever a film I saw that literally made you feel like you were going down the rabbit hole this was it. There is imagery and metaphors and then in the same breath just in your face message about this war. The film is full of gratuitous violence and bad language and the entire thing seems chaotic. However, that only serves to prove you could study this film for decades and find new things about it or new opinions. I think I expected it to be more entertaining and more mainstream but I am not disappointed to say this is a ferociously intelligent and artistic film that I don't necessarily understand or deserve to understand. Perhaps it is a testament to its time and perhaps you need far more experience in film making to truly appreciate it. Until then I am going with my gut.

The first, when Colin Clive's Creation came to Life, He, in a rush of Madness, blurts out...Now I know what it feels like to be God. Originally Thunderclaps drowned out that Blasphemy. The second Scene, when the Monster is with the Little Girl and She shows Him her Flower Boats that float, when He no longer has any flowers, He picks Her up and tosses Her in the water so She too will Float.

Judging by the summary I expected a simple revenge flick.Ugh&#x85; Where should I start ? What went wrong ? Christopher Lambert ends as a supporting character in his own movie . If you expected to see him fighting enemies like in Highlander you will be disappointed . For 99 % of the movie he just whines around and he fights in only last 10 minutes of the movie . And the final fight between Lambert and the villain is PATHETIC . I have to say I unintentionally felt sorry for the villain &#x96; the movie makers gave so much advantage for the hero in the final battle , that it just doesn't seem fair. And yet Lambert BARELY won &#x85; You have to see it for yourself &#x96; incredibly poor battle.The movie for most of the time feels like a bad drama . The viewer is caught in the conflict between two clans that is not one bit interesting or emotionally engaging. The flashbacks with Joan Chen are incredibly cheesy.

Well, actually, the movie itself is nothing that special, but it has some good stuff. It is a pretty unnecessary film. The story is nothing new, two characters stranded in the desert, they are captured by a cannibalistic family, nothing new, of course. Our main character is Michelle, played by Kate Hodge, she was solid, a scream queen that has some balls to give a good punch back to her opponents, we also have Ken Foree, a well known zombie slayer, here as a supporting character and a sidekick to Michelle. Leatherface was played by R.A. Mihailoff, well, he adds pretty good to a large, heavy-set frame of Leatherface&#x85; and that's all we got. They didn't put any effort to this new Leatherface. Why new? I'll explain later in spoiler part. Other actors did a pretty good job, but some of them were predictable, just like the story itself. But, seeing Viggo Mortensen here&#x85; damn that was interesting. Viggo was easily the best actor in the film. Give this guy an Oscar! Viggo was great. Music score, editing&#x85; those were good.SPOILERS HERE Now, there are some flaws in this film&#x85; if you have seen The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986), you know that the entire Sawyer family is dead. Including Leatherface. So this means that the family, including Leatherface is pretty new. That's the major flaw here, because, who are these people? Is the plot really settled in Texas?

There are a number of interesting turns in the story along the way. This film is also notable for its large scale epic battle scenes, which are well-staged. Braveheart is not history, but it is still an engaging film about a struggle for independence in the Middle Ages.

OK, no sense to ask these redundant questions&#x85; let's skip to the movie&#x85; Well, first of all, I'll try, because&#x85; it hurts badly. Really this film manifest such a bad felling that thrust trough your eyes and then to your brain, and both hurts badly! The first Mortal Kombat (1995) is not the best film in the world, it's actually a pretty crappy film, but decent with some pretty cool and fair stuff, but compared to Annihilation&#x85; it's a freaking brilliant film. So, the story goes right where the first movie ended, which means that is generally based upon Mortal Kombat 2 game, but they also put some characters from Mortal Kombat 3 to make it more cool&#x85; but it does not work. So, Shao Khan, the great emperor of the Outworld and one of the toughest fighter ever, being almost a god-like creature, comes to the earth to stop mortals to enjoy their brief moment of rest and victory&#x85; what a prick. And, so&#x85; what else do you expect?! Our mortal good guys join their forces again to defeat Shao Khan. Otherwise&#x85; we wouldn't have the plot.Let's check out the acting\/fighting\/stuntman crew Robin Shou returns to reprise the role of Liu Kang, he was pretty decent in the first film, although he can't act worth a sh*t&#x85; this film ultimately buried his career, just that he can end up later in other crap film Street Fighter &#x96; Legend of Chun Li&#x85; poor guy. Raiden is played by&#x85; by&#x85; what a? Who? Where is Christopher Lambert? Yeah&#x85; Lambert choose to do Beowulf (1999) instead, which was also a crappy film! Why, Christopher&#x85; Annihilation and Beowulf are crap films&#x85; but why did you pick the other one. I say this because he was good as Raiden, even with his wooden acting&#x85; but enough of this&#x85; stick to the film, stick to the review&#x85; you see? You see what happens? So, Raiden is played by James Remar, well Remar is not a bad actor&#x85; but the role of Raiden did not suited him, he was so uninterested with his role, he tries to look wise, but he all he does is walking around, staring at some little dot on the wall and deliver the lines without any emotions&#x85; damn&#x85; Oh, we got Sonya Blade here&#x85; played by&#x85; um&#x85; Sandra Hess? Well, to be honest&#x85; Hess was better than Bridgette Willson, she performed her own fights and stunts, being athletic and all, and even more hotter&#x85; but don't expect any acting from her at all. Johnny Cage is here too&#x85; played by&#x85; Chris Conrad? What the? OK&#x85; Now&#x85; the movie didn't even begin properly and they presented different actors who are playing two important characters in the story. Bridgette Willson and Linden Ashby were original actors to play Sonya and Cage, and they did it decently&#x85; but, now&#x85; you just have to, psychologically, get use to the new actors&#x85; that was unbearable. Well, at least they kept Talisa Soto as Kitana&#x85; but&#x85; she was even worse than in the first film. Delivering the lines, without any life in you doesn't make you interesting. Then, we have Shao Khan, played by Brian Thompson. Honestly&#x85; not a bad choice, he is pretty hulking, menacing, he has that deep, booming voice, and he also knows martial arts in real life, but&#x85; he can't act properly. In my opinion, he tried to deliver lines like a classically trained actor, but failed because of his retarded, silly tone. His fight scenes were decent, though. We also have Jax, played by Lynn Red Williams (a former American gladiator), who was used in the film as a comic relief to replace Johnny Cage&#x85; but no luck. Sindel is played by Musetta Vander, which delivers the most silliest lines in the film, combined to terrible acting&#x85; fail guaranteed. We also have Shinnok, played by Reiner Schoene&#x85; now that was the most unusual thing in the film&#x85; Shinnok sounded too German. Well, no wonder, the actor is German, but that was too&#x85; unusual, to silly, here comes Shinnok and I think I expect him to talk in some deep, powerful voice&#x85;  but, remember the DVD, or VHS cover that says Destroy all Expectations, that's the scene&#x85; after 10-15 minutes into the film&#x85; where my expectations were totally annihilated&#x85; for f**k sake&#x85; Then, we have Sheeva, played by Marjean Holden. Marjean looks pretty interesting in that bad suit, but her character was too much. We have Motaro played by Deron McBee, my Lord&#x85; have they ever seen Motaro? He is a lot bigger and more powerful than that&#x85; he was terrible. Irina Pantaeva played Jade. Irina is hot supermodel&#x85; but&#x85; isn't jade a black girl? While Irina is Eskimo? And her acting? Don't ask me&#x85; And finally, we have a brief appearance of Nightwolf&#x85; played by Litefoot, a terrible actor, they took him because he has Indian heritage&#x85; and he did poorly&#x85; although make up and costume department made him to look like Nightwolf as much as they can. And of course&#x85; we have Scorpion, Sub Zero, Reptile (again), Ermac and Rain as the new one and Noob Saibot for short moment also Smoke and Cyrax&#x85; martial artists who played these guys did a pretty good job, although their costumes were horrible. And Scorpion? What a hell, he appears, fights a little bit, than grabs Kitana and yells suckers and then disappears&#x85; what an a-hole. Sub Zero&#x85; well, that's not him&#x85; that was his brother&#x85; in the first film&#x85; well no matter. That's a big ninja clan, full of brothers and sisters&#x85; that's pretty much in the film&#x85;which makes no sense at all, and makes story look more dumb.So&#x85; the entire movie is freakishly bad&#x85; you don't want to have anything with it&#x85; trust me.

And I'm ready to spill it all out, everything toxic about this piece of crap. First of all, Steven E. de Souza&#x85; kill yourself. Really, kill yourself. You, you monster! You ruined the good old Japanese stuff! There's a new rule! Americans are not allowed to touch anything Japanese and turn it to a film! Nothing! Got that?! Based upon the popular Japanese arcade fighting games, of course, it's impossible for this game to run away from Hollywood. I hate when that happens.

Thanks to Julia and his enormous acting talent and unmistakable charisma, his Bison is marvelous. Every word he says, every move he makes, we are watching him, he knows how to attract attention. Raul Julia stated that he starred in the film because of his sons, who loved the video games. So, just for his kids, well fathers are real heroes in real life. But, when the film was nearly over, he died from cancer and the movie was dedicated to him. That's noble&#x85; but is it really noble to dedicate this piece of crap? I would spin in my grave.

Until Professor Hobby (William Hurt) begins to manufacture children robots with human feelings and emotions, to be sold to families who have always wanted to have children. One day Henry Swinton (Sam Robards) decides to buy a robot named David (Haley Joel Osment) for him and his wife Monica (Frances O'Connor) who suffers from the lack of his son Martin (Jake Thomas) who is in a terrible coma. Over the months Monica creates a great mother's love for David, and David treats her with great love of a son to his mother from admiration and obedience. But everything changes when the son of Henry and Monica wakes up from the come and get back home and start involving David in a lot of confusion.

Wow . I don't remember anything similar in my life . Even Batman and Robin' didn't killed the Batman comic books (yes , I know that is a MUCH stronger franchise than Barbwire franchise , but B&R did have THAT strength to kill anything associated with it). And today we live in an era where even Alvin and chipmunks have sequels. The movie is based on a comic book I've never read or even heard of . Not that I regret it . Some comic books are hard to stand while you read them and perhaps even unadaptable (Spawn anyone ?). I believe this is a perfect example.I have a theory that from time to time Hollywood makes a movie that is such a compilation of everything bad in American cinema (style over substance , kitsch , stupidity , bad taste , cheap at heart) that it has a power of nuclear bomb which destroys everything in it's range . Barbwire isn't really a movie made with BAD TASTE , it's more like a movie made with NO TASTE .The ideal symbol of no taste is the star of Barbwire itself &#x96; Pamela Anderson . There is a scene here where she walks down a corridor . You see her breasts first . Almost ONLY her breasts .

I can't believe somebody so UGLY was considered to be a sex symbol of the 90's . Maybe people deep down are very primitive like caveman ?

Anyway , Anderson was considered sexy and someone thought that big boobs will be enough to make a good or at least commercially successful movie. If you're a fan of Anderson's body you will be probably happy . She wears tight clothes and you can see her boobs few times. As for her acting skills &#x96; well she's better than Steven Seagal , but that's hardly accomplishment. The movie is pretty much a remake of Casablanca only set in post apocalyptic future. It's kinda interesting how you could take one of the best screenplays in the world and f*** everything that was perfect in the original movie.

According to him this was the best movie he had seen in his lifetime. After I saw it, trust me nothing came anywhere near to the level on which Shawshank Redemption is! Once you start watching it, it takes you in so subtly that you won't even know and you're deep in the movie, and till the final curtains fall, no matter how important it is, but you just can't leave that screen!
