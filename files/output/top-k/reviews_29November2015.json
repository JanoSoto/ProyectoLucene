This movie is not a true portrayal of the real Patch Adams. After seeing this movie, I studied the real Patch Adams, wrote to him, met him and spent time with him.The movie is actually nothing more than Robin Williams in a doctor's suit clowning around. Steve Oedekerk wrote the script and Tom Shadyac used that as his bible, not the books and works of the real Patch Adams. Bevause of that, this movie in storyline is Steve Oedekerk's book class about Patch Adams' book 'Gesundheit'. This movie was Tom Shadyac's first 'reality based' comedy, as he said in interviews. Nice try on Shadyac's side. But everybody in this movie is trying too hard. In the role of Patch, Robin Wiliams is funny, clownish and generous when he's feeling good, but over-dramatic and completely rude\/anarchy when beaten down or worked against. That's not the real Patch Adams.Patch himself describes his portrayal as a kindergarten version of himself, which I think is the best way to describe the movie version of Patch. Clowning around, having to deal with issues on a personal level is what we see in this movie. No show about Adams' serious and generous side as a worker for world wide peace, politics and a better health care system.In this movie, Robin's Patch is more just Robin Williams performing a one man stand up comedy many times. On the scene with the meat, for example. Or when welcoming the gynaecologists. It's all funny, but actually nothing more than stand up comedy and the relationship with Patch's message about health, commitment, etc. is not present. The movie depicts just brief moments on those matters, like Robin's speech in the sort-of courtroom.In 2012 Patch told me a new movie was in development about him and his extreme wisdom. The late Robin Wiliams would not be in it, which is of course naturally now after his tragic death.Don't get me wrong, this movie is of value for me, I just think they could have done a way better job...

","genre":"Biography, Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"29 November 2015","score":"","review":" Based on the 1977 short story of the same name by Stephen King, this is a wonderfully awful horror film. I have no idea how closely it sticks to the story since I never read it or any of King's work for that matter but the script is horrendously written with more plot holes than you can shake a stick at. The only even remotely clever bits such as the depiction of the mob mentality engendered by cults are taken from either much better works or, unfortunately, real life incidents.The film takes a dash of Village of the Damned (1960) and a pinch of The Wicker Man (1973) to come up with a storyline concerning evil children who sacrifice people to ensure a good corn harvest. Now, I like corn as much as the next guy but this approach seems a little excessive to me. Isaac is basically an older version of Damien from The Omen (1976) crossed with Wesley Crusher and the film's score is a poor man's version of that film's. It's essentially a rehash of earlier horror classics. Unlike The Wicker Man, however, this film actually attempts to make the relevant crop frightening in a few scenes. Amazingly, it doesn't work very well. The director Fritz Kiersch is hardly Richard Attenborough or Kenneth Branagh but he's no Ed Wood or Tommy Wiseau either. Some shots are downright or at least borderline competent.The plot concerns the lovely little town of Gatlin, Nebraska which is ruled by Isaac and the other followers of He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Three years earlier, Isaac, clearly a very persuasive guy, convinced the rest of the town's children to ritually murder their parents and every other adult in town (bar one mechanic). The town has been occupied only by the cultists since then and no one has noticed in the meantime. Isaac even used his powers of persuasion to convince cartographers to take Gatlin off the maps, apparently. John Franklin's performance as Isaac could not be described as good but, by God (or should I say by He Who Walks Behind the Rows?), it is entertaining. He steals all of his scenes and makes the film far more entertaining than it would been otherwise. My favourite line is Question not my judgement, Malachai. I am the giver of his word. His delivery and contemptuous expression are simply hilarious. It's a great verbal bitch-slap.Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton play the hapless interlopers \/ outlanders Burt and Vicki who wind up in Gatlin while on the way to Seattle. Hamilton and Horton are actually good actors who deservedly went on to bigger and better things the Terminator franchise and Beauty and the Beast (1987) for her and thirtysomething for him. On the bright side, they keep the film from being even more terrible. On the less bright side, they keep the film from being even more unintentionally hilarious. The two of them have good chemistry even though their characters express little affection for each other until the end of the film. However, every time that Vicki yelled Burt!, I mentally added Ernie! The only other actor in the film who gives a genuinely decent performance is R.G. Armstrong as Diehl, the aforementioned mechanic. Courtney Gains, whose career peaked the next year with his one line role in Back to the Future, is awful as Isaac's disloyal second-in-command Malachai but he is not quite as hilariously awful as Franklin. But, hey, he at least put everything into it! The same is true of most of the other child actors, none of whom went on to great success. Incidentally, Back to the Future is my favourite film of all time. This film did not threaten that status.I mentioned a few of the plot holes already but this is one of the biggest. In the early part of the film, Burt and Vicki exhibit genius level intelligence when they run over a child named Joseph who turned out to be already dead, having had his throat slit. It just wasn't his day. They then decide that it is a good idea to bungle his corpse into the boot of their car and look for help. Right...Did it not occur to them that if they were stopped by the police and they found the body, it might look just a tad suspicious? No one with half a brain would believe that he had been killed by someone else and they were on their way to the authorities. Besides which, wrapping him in a blanket and shoving him into the boot would destroy any and all forensic evidence that may exist. He is never removed from the boot, meaning that he is left there to rot. Very conscientious! Another notable one is that the cultists kill Diehl, admittedly without Isaac's permission, for no reason whatsoever as he seems just as willing to abide by the condition that he tells no one of their existence as he was before. Furthermore, Job describes the brutal murder of his father which took place within several feet of him in a very calm fashion. One would think that this would traumatise a child but he and his sister Sarah take their parents' deaths and all the other horrific events in Gatlin in their stride. They actually giggle at the end, amused by the fact that Burt and Vicki kiss. Oh, and Sarah has the unexplained ability to predict the future through her drawings. Sure, why not? When He Who Walks Behind the Rows manifests, he is killed by a comparatively small explosion caused by a Molotov cocktail. One would also think that a demon from the fiery depths of Hell would be made of sterner stuff but apparently not.Overall, this is a great so bad, it's good film. It may not be down there with Plan 9 from Outer Space, Troll 2 or The Room but it's still pretty far down there.

When Moore is later consoled by Sam's best friend and banking work-colleague Carl, the bigger picture quickly became clearer, leading to a reasonably exciting if slightly over-the-top conclusion as Sam races to save Molly from joining him in the hereafter as the bad guys come after her.Of course, to communicate with Molly, Sam has to find a suitable conduit so enter Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae fake medium character and an entertaining sub-plot caper where she and Sam conspire to thwart Carl's embezzlement plans in person at the bank as well as the inevitable scenes where Goldberg first becomes aware of his at first unwelcome presence and later when she's trying to convince Moore of Sam's existence.Sure there are slushy bits too, like the oft-parodied (and very suggestive!) pottery scene to the backdrop of The Righteous Brothers' Unchained Melody, making the film a woman's favourite ever since, but that may be as much to do with big old handsome Patrick as anything else. Undoubtedly though he and Moore are two of the beautiful people, living the life in downtown New York, but they combine well and have you rooting for them all the way through.

Sure much of the storyline is contrived. But then the movies aren't much like real life, which I believe is a big reason we go to them. Of course, the more realism in a movie, the less obvious contrivance there should be. But Charade is tongue-in-cheek romanticism from the git- go. Besides, the stars here, Grant and Hepburn, have enough charm and charisma to slide us over the logical rough spots. Then too, the narrative is a cleverly constructed guessing game. We never know what the next twist will be, right down to the final scene. Thus we're engaged from the start. Still, the 2-hour runtime is more than the developments need. But then plot threads have to accommodate the two celebrities with enough personal screen time to show their shine.

The story doesn't flow as smoothly, the ending climax isn't as exciting as the two previous ones (we have to blow the Death Star again?), the characters are not as good as they used to be and the new stuff, which there is still a lot of, to the film's credit, is not as good as in the previous one. In this film we see for the first time the signs and phenomena that would come to haunt us in the prequel trilogy.To go over a few of the highlights, we have the ewoks. Now, apparently they were supposed to be wookies, which would have been amazing. Chewbacca is a fan favourite, and we would have gotten to see his people, his culture, more laser crossbows, all that good stuff. Instead we have the elite troops of the Galactic Empire being beaten back by an army of teddy bears. I'm not the only one seeing the problem here, right?Plus, the characters. Luke, Han and Vader are still very good and especially Vader has some his best moments in this film, especially near the end. But Leia, for example, has been relocated to a complete support role, to the point that she really has no point in being in this film. She's a far cry from the nail hard, snarky, blaster-toting space princess she was in the first film. Not quite on the Padmé-level of chickification, but heading in the same direction. Ian McDiarmid also has his screen debut as the Emperor in this film, and while he is amazing and will pretty much carry the prequel films alone with his charisma, here his over the topness is a bit unsettling because you're already wary and looking for flaws because of the ewoks.Then again, the effects are still amazing, the battle scenes are exciting, the final confrontation with Luke, Vader and the Emperor is one of cinema's finest for a reason, the space battle of Endor is a good one and the story is by no means bad one. It just isn't as good as the two previous ones, which are two of the best adventure stories ever put on film. So go ahead and see the film if you've liked the trilogy so far.

A lot of the action scenes were unnecessary, until the diamonds come into play, and the punk-type baddies looked ridiculous, along with the massive baddies posing as FBI agents. Anyway, this movie sees Chan (Keung), travel to America to visit his uncle so he can be there for his wedding. While his uncle is off on his honeymoon, he helps to sell his uncles shop and he sticks around until she gets the shop up and running, under her management. As the shop is in a bad area, the Bronx, he helps to fight of the local baddies who steal and damage the shop and he soon becomes targeted by the thugs because he shows them up. Whilst fighting them of, there is a diamond deal going on in the area, which goes totally bad and after a big shoot out, one of the thugs gets his hands on the diamonds and he hides them in Chans next door neighbours wheel chair. Chan then becomes the action hero by fighting of the baddies who want to get there hands on the diamonds, by saving the young kid who has the diamonds stuck in the pillow on his wheelchair. They then hand the diamonds over to the police and with the help of the young boys sister, they fight of the many hit men who work for the mafia to retrieve the diamonds, along with the local thug who wants to recover the loot that he put in the wheelchair. The action scenes were quite impressive in this film and I liked Chans acting throughout. I actually found some of the comedy funny, for once, and the different characters all brought something fresh to the project. As with many Jackie Chan movies, he does push some of the stunts to the extreme, by jumping across buildings and crashing through the city in a hovercraft but it's all put together well and I liked the chemistry between Chan and the disabled boy. Basically, it's a watchable movie which has a decent mixture of elements which made it enjoyable but it's not in the same class as his old, authentic films which are in a class of there own. Watchable!Round-Up This movie was directed by Stanley Tong, who also made Police Story Supercop, Supercop 2, Police Story 4 First Strike and the Myth with Chan, so that might explain why a lot of the stunts were so amazing. They obviously built a relationship of trust which gives Chan the ability to push his stunts to the limit but with the many different laws in America, I still thought that the actual fighting scenes weren't that great. I missed the epic, one to one fight at the end but he did bring something original to the project with the hovercraft scene. This was another one of those films were Chan was trying to crack America, which wasn't the best move for his career but this movie certainly went down well at the time and it brought his action skills to a worldwide market.Budget $7.5million Worldwide Gross $32millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action\/crime\/martial arts\/comedies starring Jackie Chan, Anita Mui, Francoise Yip and Bill Tung. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 November 2015","score":"","review":" Review Its been years since I've seen this film and it does seem a bit dated in places but I still enjoyed it.

I knew little about the history of the struggle for Irish independence but after seeing this film, it propelled me to do a little research. As a history lesson Michael Collins does well in covering the main historical points but Jordan does little in presenting the British point of view.The film begins with the Easter Rising of 1916, a violent protest in Dublin which resulted in the defeat and arrest of the leaders amongst the Irish rebels. What Jordan doesn't let on here is that the rebellion was not at all popular with the Irish people and the tide didn't turn until the British executed the majority of the rebels following the rebellion.Liam Neeson does well in playing Collins as a dynamic, strong character but Collins was around thirty when the events of the film takes place and Neeson was about 14 years older. If you're willing to forgive the age difference, Neeson is quite believable as the fiery Irish leader who is still regarded as a George Washington figure amongst the contemporary Irish populace.Jordan is at his best when he dispassionately regurgitates the sequence of events that led to the establishment of Ireland as a free state and the resulting civil war. Of particular note are the gripping scenes of escalating violence Collins is a beaten by the Royal Irish Constabulary after speaking at an election rally; Collins recruits a squad of killers who murder 14 members of the MI5 Cairo Gang and the ensuing act of genocidal revenge taken by the Black and Tans paramilitary force at a soccer match; the IRA attack on the Custom House which Collins opposed as he knew the British would easily win; the attack on Collins after the treaty with the British, at an anti-Treaty Republican rally; the offensive against the The Four Courts by the anti-Treaty side of the IRA, despite Collins' bitter opposition; and the ambush of Collins, resulting in his death.Also of great interest is the conflict between Collins and Eamon de Valera (played by an effective Alan Rickam) who early on felt that Collins was acting on his own. The actual split between the two leaders is foreshadowed when de Valera goes to meet President Woodrow Wilson in order to gain recognition of the IRA's objectives and takes Collins' best friend and constant companion, Harry Boland, with him. Eventually de Valera orders Collins to negotiate the treaty with the British over his objections that he's not a diplomat. And it was de Valera who split with Collins over the terms of the treaty which broke Ireland into two and still had the new Irish Free State swearing allegiance to the Crown.What's most fascinating about Collins is that initially he was regarded as a terrorist by the British but after negotiating the treaty between Ireland and the UK, he was now regarded as a moderate. In fact, during the Irish civil war, the British supplied arms to Collins' forces who eventually defeated the anti-Treaty faction. Jordan argues that Collins' targets were either brutal forces of the British intelligence service or Irish collaborators, not innocent civilians. Whatever the case, Collins, who was yesterday's terrorist now became today's dignified statesman.Jordan unfortunately leaves out the British side of the story. Instead, they're all evil or supporters of evil. Jordan is not adverse to twisting historical facts to make the British seem worse. The scene of the massacre at the soccer match is exaggerated&#x97;no armored vehicle entered the premises and machine gunned people in the stands. A British Court of Inquiry found that the actions of the paramilitary group was carried out without orders and exceeded the demands of the situation. The commander of the Dublin District stated that the firing on the crowd was carried out without orders, was indiscriminate, and unjustifiable, with the exception of any shooting which took place inside the enclosure. Nonetheless it was also true that this inquiry was suppressed by the British government. The King of England and some British politicians expressed their horror at the Bloody Sunday massacre and such a public relations disaster did much to strengthen the hand of de Valera's government, eventually leading to the peace treaty between Ireland and England.The killing of the double agent Irish detective who aided Collins, Ned Broy, also appeared to be designed by Jordan to manipulate the audience into hating the British even more. Broy is actually a composite character of three people. While people were tortured by the British (particularly those who were involved in the assassinations of British intelligence agents on Bloody Sunday), Broy lived well into his 80s.Jordan's decision to take a few liberties with historical events and characters doesn't seem so bad in light of his overall success in depicting the chronology of events in the Irish fight for independence and its aftermath. Nonetheless, aside from Collins (and perhaps de Valera) most of the other characters in the drama are unremarkable and certainly Julia Roberts has little to do as the love interest between Collins and sideman Boland.While necessary, after a while, many of the violent goings on in Michael Collins, felt more like a docudrama. Only when the conflict between de Valera and Collins heats up, can one say that the narrative becomes truly compelling. Again what's missing is the British point of view (and perhaps a singular antagonist) which could have added to the efficaciousness of this well staged period piece.

As a history lesson Michael Collins does well in covering the main historical points but Jordan does little in presenting the British point of view.The film begins with the Easter Rising of 1916, a violent protest in Dublin which resulted in the defeat and arrest of the leaders amongst the Irish rebels. What Jordan doesn't let on here is that the rebellion was not at all popular with the Irish people and the tide didn't turn until the British executed the majority of the rebels following the rebellion.Liam Neeson does well in playing Collins as a dynamic, strong character but Collins was around thirty when the events of the film takes place and Neeson was about 14 years older. If you're willing to forgive the age difference, Neeson is quite believable as the fiery Irish leader who is still regarded as a George Washington figure amongst the contemporary Irish populace.Jordan is at his best when he dispassionately regurgitates the sequence of events that led to the establishment of Ireland as a free state and the resulting civil war. Of particular note are the gripping scenes of escalating violence Collins is a beaten by the Royal Irish Constabulary after speaking at an election rally; Collins recruits a squad of killers who murder 14 members of the MI5 Cairo Gang and the ensuing act of genocidal revenge taken by the Black and Tans paramilitary force at a soccer match; the IRA attack on the Custom House which Collins opposed as he knew the British would easily win; the attack on Collins after the treaty with the British, at an anti-Treaty Republican rally; the offensive against the The Four Courts by the anti-Treaty side of the IRA, despite Collins' bitter opposition; and the ambush of Collins, resulting in his death.Also of great interest is the conflict between Collins and Eamon de Valera (played by an effective Alan Rickam) who early on felt that Collins was acting on his own. The actual split between the two leaders is foreshadowed when de Valera goes to meet President Woodrow Wilson in order to gain recognition of the IRA's objectives and takes Collins' best friend and constant companion, Harry Boland, with him. Eventually de Valera orders Collins to negotiate the treaty with the British over his objections that he's not a diplomat. And it was de Valera who split with Collins over the terms of the treaty which broke Ireland into two and still had the new Irish Free State swearing allegiance to the Crown.What's most fascinating about Collins is that initially he was regarded as a terrorist by the British but after negotiating the treaty between Ireland and the UK, he was now regarded as a moderate. In fact, during the Irish civil war, the British supplied arms to Collins' forces who eventually defeated the anti-Treaty faction. Jordan argues that Collins' targets were either brutal forces of the British intelligence service or Irish collaborators, not innocent civilians. Whatever the case, Collins, who was yesterday's terrorist now became today's dignified statesman.Jordan unfortunately leaves out the British side of the story. Instead, they're all evil or supporters of evil. Jordan is not adverse to twisting historical facts to make the British seem worse. The scene of the massacre at the soccer match is exaggerated&#x97;no armored vehicle entered the premises and machine gunned people in the stands. A British Court of Inquiry found that the actions of the paramilitary group was carried out without orders and exceeded the demands of the situation. The commander of the Dublin District stated that the firing on the crowd was carried out without orders, was indiscriminate, and unjustifiable, with the exception of any shooting which took place inside the enclosure. Nonetheless it was also true that this inquiry was suppressed by the British government. The King of England and some British politicians expressed their horror at the Bloody Sunday massacre and such a public relations disaster did much to strengthen the hand of de Valera's government, eventually leading to the peace treaty between Ireland and England.The killing of the double agent Irish detective who aided Collins, Ned Broy, also appeared to be designed by Jordan to manipulate the audience into hating the British even more. Broy is actually a composite character of three people. While people were tortured by the British (particularly those who were involved in the assassinations of British intelligence agents on Bloody Sunday), Broy lived well into his 80s.Jordan's decision to take a few liberties with historical events and characters doesn't seem so bad in light of his overall success in depicting the chronology of events in the Irish fight for independence and its aftermath. Nonetheless, aside from Collins (and perhaps de Valera) most of the other characters in the drama are unremarkable and certainly Julia Roberts has little to do as the love interest between Collins and sideman Boland.While necessary, after a while, many of the violent goings on in Michael Collins, felt more like a docudrama. Only when the conflict between de Valera and Collins heats up, can one say that the narrative becomes truly compelling. Again what's missing is the British point of view (and perhaps a singular antagonist) which could have added to the efficaciousness of this well staged period piece.

And then, in order to experience first hand what the power of the tingler would be all about, he actually injected himself to induce the kind of paranoia and fear that would result from it!

It does it by taking the existing universe, expanding it in a logical manner, staying with what worked in the previous film yet adding something new and original as well. You can definitely see that they hadn't planned for this film in advance because there's a lot of new stuff. Suddenly we have the character of Yoda, the reveal of Luke's father, the romantic tension between Han and Leia (you can see pretty well in the first film that she was supposed to end up with Luke) and the continuation of the war between the Alliance and the Empire.But, unlike in so many other sequels, in this case it works because the film makers hadn't painted themselves into a corner with the first film. There was still story left from the original to explore. The Emperor hadn't been dealt with, it was possible that Darth Vader might have survived the destruction of the first Death Star and Luke still had much to learn about the Force. And thus we get a film that might be one of the best sequels ever made, if not one of the best movies in general.The film is also a significant leap forward in terms of technical quality. They had a much bigger budget with this film, plus more experience with the new effects the first film had pioneered, and it shows. From Darth Vader's improved armor and look to the explosions and the spaceships to the lightsaber battles. They all look fantastic and have held up remarkably well over the decades.Furthermore, the story is just as good as in the first one. The Battle of Hoth that opens the film might very well be one of my favourite battle scenes in all of cinema and the lightsaber duel near the end of the film is easily the best one in all of the franchise. Plus, we get a lot of new stuff, as stated, and they all work very well. Yoda's puppetry effects have not aged as well as some other effects in the film, but they're still pretty impressive even by today's standards and the character itself is a lot of fun. Kind of Jar Jar done right. You know, a crackpot local (I know he's not really from Dagobah, shut up) alien who talks funny, messes around, but is still needed for the plot. Except in Yoda's case there's some actual wisdom beneath the initial goofiness.Overall I think I prefer Episode IV to this one, but it's by a very slight margin. This one has better battles, better effects and equally great story, but Episode IV had better atmosphere and sense of mythos. Nevertheless, they're both fantastic scifi epics and well worth a watch if you've been living under a rock for the last half a century.

GoldenEye got the '90s ball rolling, boldly reasserting Bond's relevance and appeal in a more action-oriented, post-cold war setting, but it's Tomorrow Never Dies that charts his most topical, inevitable evolution Bond as a video game character. But if the prospect of 007 swapping his Walther PPK in favour of dual-wielding submachine guns a-la first person shooter is enough to make you want to swig enough martinis to take you back to the '60s, take heart this Bond may be a livelier, non-smoking, and more raucous edition, but he's still replete with more than enough charm, poise, and oddly topical sociopolitical satire to make Tomorrow Never Dies a somewhat puzzlingly rocky but reliably fun 007 escapade.With video game tie-ins on the brain, it's rather appropriate that Tomorrow Never Dies targets mass media broadcasting by way of central conceit (the opening credits, accompanied by Sheryl Crowe's silky, albeit forgettable, title ballad, drives the critique home, transforming Bond's customary slinking women into cybernetic nightmares). It's an unexpected reconciliation to have one of the most trigger-happy Bond films play as a strangely appropriate companion piece to Wag the Dog of all things, but the premise of machinating a world war for news coverage strikes the perfect balance between ludicrous and credible to play as far less fantastic, and far more ominously prophetic, than was likely initially intended. This paradoxical inconsistency proves pervasive, though. In contrast to the razor-sharp satire at its core, the film's script eschews all of GoldenEye's slick deftness in favour of a campier, flamboyant levity more befitting the Roger Moore era. This is no fault of Brosnan's, who glides across screen with a suave nonchalance. He aces Bond's more cold-blooded moments while still committing to some of the more groan- worthy one-liners of the post-Roger era (we seem to have developed a certain attachment&#x85;), while grounding the more bombastic shootouts by never skimping on the chance to straighten his tie after a kill shot. It's his least showy rendition of the role, but his consummate smoothness is a perfect fit for the breezier tone of the film. Regardless, this can take some acclimatizing to, particularly thanks to nemesis Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce, delivering a deliciously hammy Rupert Murdoch caricature), who pontificates enough to make Auric Goldfinger roll his eyes. Nonetheless, in the wake of the grimmer, more personal Bonds to follow, it's hard to begrudge Pryce for taking so much evident joy in chomping through his monstrous monologues (his self-satisfied giddiness when proclaiming we're on a STEALTH BOAT is palpably infectious), and thereby reminding the film around him to share in the fun.But don't be distressed director Roger Spottiswoode is more than happy to compensate for the film's talkier political subterfuge with enough explosions to retain the interest of all the mass media drones Carver salaciously preys on. For the purists, Spottiswood sprinkles in some vintage 007 globetrotting stuntwork (a halo jump skydive turned scuba dive; a breathtaking motorcycle\/helicopter chase through the streets of Vietnam) amidst the more contemporary shoot-'em-ups. Bond even gets in on the video gaming fun, with Brosnan visibly cackling with meta glee as he drags his finger across a cell phone track pad, orchestrating his own car chase remotely from the back seat of his car. It's a thrilling sequence that toes the line of being too audacious even for Bond, but is curiously restricted to the confines of an interior parking lot &#x96; a setting almost as underwhelming as Bond's boxy new BMW, comedic relief German GPS and all. Grow up, 007. Thankfully, sh*t hits the fan with the introduction of Michelle Yeoh's Wai Lin (literally, in the case of her Chinese Q-branch gadgetry, yielding the film's best pun) &#x96; arguably the first 'Bond girl' to be such a match for Bond that, rather than being subject to his customary sexist condescension, he almost pleads for her partnership. Yeoh is easily the most fun addition to the film, spicing up action sequences with her martial arts prowess, and balancing it with a perfectly acidic dry wit and oddly chipper approach to conflict resolution. She and Brosnan share a wonderfully curt but sparkling chemistry, trading barbs while shooting over each other's shoulders, that the franchise has never quite replicated since. By way of supporting cast, Teri Hatcher introduces the intriguingly dark subtext of infidelity into Bond's womanizing, even if Hatcher's affections may be a bit too glib to properly embody her character's world-weary heartbreak. Again mirroring the Moore days, Götz Otto, Ricky Jay, and the wonderful Vincent Schiavelli have fun as a pantheon of goofy yet sinister henchmen. Finally, Judi Dench's frosty M maintains an exquisite twinkle in her eye throughout, whether airly prompting Bond to pump Carver's wife (for information) or derisively barking at her As Time Goes By co-star Geoffrey Palmer, here fretting as an oafish Naval commander, while Desmond Llewellyn's Q saves a superfluous insurance waiver aside (will you need collision coverage&#x85;?) thanks to his peerless cantankerous charisma.Imbalanced oddity that it is, Tomorrow Never Dies clips along at a tidy pace (one of the few Bond films not to breach two hours) &#x96; a clumsy but energetically competent return to the frivolity of the Moore era. Bolstered by the clever timeliness of its conflict and the winning chemistry between Brosnan and Yeoh, Tomorrow Never Dies makes for lighter and more action-heavy Bond fare, but exemplifies the escapist charm of the series without drenching it in the CGI excesses to follow.

GoldenEye got the '90s ball rolling, boldly reasserting Bond's relevance and appeal in a more action-oriented, post-cold war setting, but it's Tomorrow Never Dies that charts his most topical, inevitable evolution Bond as a video game character. But if the prospect of 007 swapping his Walther PPK in favour of dual-wielding submachine guns a-la first person shooter is enough to make you want to swig enough martinis to take you back to the '60s, take heart this Bond may be a livelier, non-smoking, and more raucous edition, but he's still replete with more than enough charm, poise, and oddly topical sociopolitical satire to make Tomorrow Never Dies a somewhat puzzlingly rocky but reliably fun 007 escapade.With video game tie-ins on the brain, it's rather appropriate that Tomorrow Never Dies targets mass media broadcasting by way of central conceit (the opening credits, accompanied by Sheryl Crowe's silky, albeit forgettable, title ballad, drives the critique home, transforming Bond's customary slinking women into cybernetic nightmares). It's an unexpected reconciliation to have one of the most trigger-happy Bond films play as a strangely appropriate companion piece to Wag the Dog of all things, but the premise of machinating a world war for news coverage strikes the perfect balance between ludicrous and credible to play as far less fantastic, and far more ominously prophetic, than was likely initially intended. This paradoxical inconsistency proves pervasive, though. In contrast to the razor-sharp satire at its core, the film's script eschews all of GoldenEye's slick deftness in favour of a campier, flamboyant levity more befitting the Roger Moore era. This is no fault of Brosnan's, who glides across screen with a suave nonchalance. He aces Bond's more cold-blooded moments while still committing to some of the more groan- worthy one-liners of the post-Roger era (we seem to have developed a certain attachment&#x85;), while grounding the more bombastic shootouts by never skimping on the chance to straighten his tie after a kill shot. It's his least showy rendition of the role, but his consummate smoothness is a perfect fit for the breezier tone of the film. Regardless, this can take some acclimatizing to, particularly thanks to nemesis Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce, delivering a deliciously hammy Rupert Murdoch caricature), who pontificates enough to make Auric Goldfinger roll his eyes. Nonetheless, in the wake of the grimmer, more personal Bonds to follow, it's hard to begrudge Pryce for taking so much evident joy in chomping through his monstrous monologues (his self-satisfied giddiness when proclaiming we're on a STEALTH BOAT is palpably infectious), and thereby reminding the film around him to share in the fun.But don't be distressed director Roger Spottiswoode is more than happy to compensate for the film's talkier political subterfuge with enough explosions to retain the interest of all the mass media drones Carver salaciously preys on. For the purists, Spottiswood sprinkles in some vintage 007 globetrotting stuntwork (a halo jump skydive turned scuba dive; a breathtaking motorcycle\/helicopter chase through the streets of Vietnam) amidst the more contemporary shoot-'em-ups. Bond even gets in on the video gaming fun, with Brosnan visibly cackling with meta glee as he drags his finger across a cell phone track pad, orchestrating his own car chase remotely from the back seat of his car. It's a thrilling sequence that toes the line of being too audacious even for Bond, but is curiously restricted to the confines of an interior parking lot &#x96; a setting almost as underwhelming as Bond's boxy new BMW, comedic relief German GPS and all.

Sherlock Holmes, and André Morell, whose Watson is far from the bumbling oaf of the earlier Universal Studios series. It doesn't hurt either to have fellow Hammer stalwart Christopher Lee on standby as Sir Henry Baskerville, and with wonderfully atmospheric direction from Terence Fisher, and sumptuous production design throughout, there is much here to enjoy.Fisher opens his movie with the origin of the Baskerville curse, as told to Holmes and Watson by Doctor Richard Mortimer (Francis De Wolff), who has come to Baker Street for help after his friend, Sir Charles Baskerville, is discovered dead on the moors, apparently the victim of a terrifying beast. Holmes learns how wicked Hugo Baskerville supposedly doomed further generations of his family by hunting down and murdering an innocent young woman, thus invoking a terrible hound from Hell that lurks under the moors.Of course, Holmes knows that there must be a logical answer to the mysterious deaths that have plagued the Baskervilles, and with help from Watson, he eventually discovers the truth, but only after plenty of danger involving a deadly tarantula, the perilous Grimpen mire, a dilapidated tin mine, and the hell hound itself.While the plot does deviate somewhat from Conan Doyle's novel, most notably with the introduction of Spanish babe Cecile (Marla Landi) as love interest for Sir Henry, any liberties taken with the source material do little to spoil what is an extremely entertaining movie.8\/10, although Miles Malleson's very amusing turn as dippy entomologist Bishop Frankland almost nudged my rating to a 9.
