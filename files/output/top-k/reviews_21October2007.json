Ray Winstone plays the dad in a superb way and the young actors (Freddie Cunliffe and Lara Belmont) are more than excellent. Tim Roth knows how to make very real this performances.The storyIs about a middle class family that moves from London to Devon. In Devon Tom discover that his father is abusing his older sister so now he is very confused. Thats the main plot of the film so is a very difficult story for a lot of people so thats make this film not for everyone. Contains strong themes like sexual abuse and Tim Roth makes this film very real so thats why is a very strong story.The characters Very different from each other. The dad is always talking about his business, Tom is always bored and alone so he start to look into his own family, Jessie is also alone most of the time but she have Nick and the mom that i think is the unique happy character in the film until she knows the true about her husband and Jessie.The end is different of most of the common ends because you don't know what is going to happened and also the characters are very confused and it can be resume in the three questions that Tom ask to his sister is he dead?, how is mom? and what are we going to do?The director Tim Roth is one the my favorites actors of all time and maybe one the greatest actors in the last 15 years. He work whit Tarantino. Tornatore, Burton, Wim Wenders, Greenaway and recent whit Francis Coppola so for me that is amazing. And in this , his first film he confirm that he is also a great director and well i'm waiting to his second film.DVD well i don't know if this film was release in the cinemas of Mexico so is great to can watch this film 8 years later. I have this film in a special DVD whit 3 more film so there's not a lot of bonus material but still is great.

Both movies are considered classics, yet I fail to see why. A few years back, I thought these were truly awful but in time I learned to appreciate them a little more. Still I simply cannot shed that feeling of disappointment and therefore, to this date, I don't consider either one of them to be as brilliant as some other classics such as for example Pulp fiction or MementoAnd it all started so well. The story is about a man who suffers from insomnia and desperately tries to escape his boring existence. He meets a charismatic soap salesman and starts organizing the ultimate form of excitement with him; which they call Fight Clubs. These are hidden places where normal young men fistfight each other to get rid of whatever aggravation they possess. The liberating effect of these brutal fights actually brings these men closer together and is the beginning of a very strong yet dangerous companionship.The huge plot twist of this dark and controversial movie is as unexpected as the one of The usual suspects, but that doesn't mean that it is just as good. Basically this change is so bizarre and far-fetched that it almost entirely destroys the movie for me. I simply couldn't bring myself into believing that a thing like that could actually happen. Also looking back at everything that had transpired before, I sincerely felt that it just didn't make any sense anymore. Furthermore I hate movies that create a beautiful truth and then tear it all apart instead of letting you enjoy it a little more. I like surprises when watching a movie, but I don't like being left empty-handed at the end of a movie. I find such dishonest endings to be a huge letdown almost every single time.The acting of the two leading men is good, but I have seen a lot better by both. Edward Norton's finest performances will most likely always be in the two-faced court drama Primal fear and the classic, shocking American history X. I also like him much better in some of his other movies such as 25th hour and The score. Maybe his character in this film wasn't interesting enough but something about his acting didn't quite get the fullest of my attention. On the other hand there's Brad Pitt who's acting seemed better, but even he did far more compelling stuff in se7en and 12 monkeys. The best acting performance in this movie however came from Helena Bonham Carter. I had never seen anything quite like this from her and she was really good. There's also Meat Loaf in the unusual role of Bob.In short If it weren't for the obscure darkness near the end, I would probably like this movie a lot better. It certainly is a unique movie and that seemingly makes up for an interesting experience, but the weirdness of it all gets in the way at some point.

It has Kurosawa's stamp of awesomeness of course but visually it just blew me away. This has to be one of the most beautifully shot movies I've ever seen. The costumes, the castle and of course all of the locations are amazing. I was literally speechless for a few hours after having seen the movie; it completely changed (or at least refreshed) the way I look at the world. I think one of Kurosawa's strengths is that as incredibly talented as he is, his modesty always comes across as well; his films are never pretentious.Perhaps the only possible flaw I felt the movie had was that it only used music sparingly. I thought the music that was used was great (especially one surreal sequence which had solely music and images, no sound effects) but I wonder why more music wasn't used to add depth to some of the slower scenes. Maybe the lack of music is ultimately more effective, perhaps it enhances the dreamlike reflective quality of the movie, I can't say for sure.I don't have anything to say about the story really; I haven't read King Lear and narratives are a relatively weak point for me with movies. I tend to find the visual and musical aspects more accessible with dialogue and story more difficult to truly appreciate. I certainly found the story in Ran very engaging and thought provoking but what makes the movie for me is Kurosawa's masterful direction and also the way he makes the movie personal. Even though I didn't completely follow the movie at all times, several parts were very affecting nevertheless and it was clear that the movie meant a lot to its creator.Ran also has an epic grandeur to it; it was the most expensive Japanese film made up to its time and apparently Kurosawa spent about 10 years painting (!) storyboards for the movie. I think it shows in the movie, you really feel like so much work and consideration went into every second of it.Anyway, the way I see it, Ran is unlike any other film ever made. In terms of capturing beauty on a grand (and yet humble) scale, it is unparalleled (in my puny amount of experience). If I were a pretentious film snob (which I hope I'm not, at least, not yet) then I might say that if you haven't seen Ran, you haven't experienced cinema.

This appears to have been something of an oversight on my reviews list, despite me having seen it the other day on ITV2. The problem with this film is that it's one of those I assumed I'd already written about, thanks to heavy TV syndication. After viewing the third film the other day, I was reminded how little this had to do with the original source material but was still an entertaining, if extremely shallow, action blast with the old John Woo trademarks all present and correct.Tom Cruise returns as super-spy Ethan Hunt, who's rock-climbing holiday is interrupted by his superiors at the IMF. Ethan is asked to recruit beautiful thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to accompany him on his latest assignment to recover a deadly virus called Chimera stolen by former IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) in Australia. As Ethan fights his growing attraction to Nyah, he in unable to prevent her falling into harm's way and before long, Ethan is caught in a deadly race against time to prevent the virus being unleashed and to find the antidote to save Nyah's life.After so much criticism of the first movie's overly-complicated plot, it's no real surprise that Mission Impossible 2 is dumber than lighting a match in a room full of dynamite. This has Woo's stamp all over it, feeling like a wish-list of action scenes and death-defying stunts crammed between slow-mo shots of doves and needlessly stylish shots devoid of dialogue. It has nothing at all to do with the Mission Impossible series, something which parts one and three at least attempt. Acting is adequate but no more - Newton feels the most out-of-place - but it's the action scenes that rightly dominate and for which Woo is known for the world over. But for Woo veterans, there isn't really anything there you haven't already seen before. So basically, it's a disappointing action thriller that doesn't do anything new. So why do I prefer this to the others? Maybe it's because I'm a shallow kinda guy but I suspect the real reason I prefer this is because it's a film aimed squarely at the audience and not at the critics. Woo knows what the majority of pop-corn munchers look for in an action movie and here, he delivers such a huge amount that there is something for every action fan. The problem with that approach, especially with this film, is that it couldn't be any more different from what went before it. Imagine if one of the Godfather sequels had been a romantic comedy instead of a mob flick - this is that movie. And because it's such a wild change from the first, it effectively killed off the franchise by stripping away its identity. Even J.J. Abrams struggles to get the series back on track, despite mixing the action and the intelligence into one film. Mission Impossible 2 isn't as bad as some have claimed but it is proper movie Marmite - you'll either love it or hate it with every fibre of your being.

But for Woo veterans, there isn't really anything there you haven't already seen before. So basically, it's a disappointing action thriller that doesn't do anything new. So why do I prefer this to the others? Maybe it's because I'm a shallow kinda guy but I suspect the real reason I prefer this is because it's a film aimed squarely at the audience and not at the critics. Woo knows what the majority of pop-corn munchers look for in an action movie and here, he delivers such a huge amount that there is something for every action fan. The problem with that approach, especially with this film, is that it couldn't be any more different from what went before it. Imagine if one of the Godfather sequels had been a romantic comedy instead of a mob flick - this is that movie. And because it's such a wild change from the first, it effectively killed off the franchise by stripping away its identity. Even J.J. Abrams struggles to get the series back on track, despite mixing the action and the intelligence into one film. Mission Impossible 2 isn't as bad as some have claimed but it is proper movie Marmite - you'll either love it or hate it with every fibre of your being.

This appears to have been something of an oversight on my reviews list, despite me having seen it the other day on ITV2. The problem with this film is that it's one of those I assumed I'd already written about, thanks to heavy TV syndication. After viewing the third film the other day, I was reminded how little this had to do with the original source material but was still an entertaining, if extremely shallow, action blast with the old John Woo trademarks all present and correct.Tom Cruise returns as super-spy Ethan Hunt, who's rock-climbing holiday is interrupted by his superiors at the IMF. Ethan is asked to recruit beautiful thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to accompany him on his latest assignment to recover a deadly virus called Chimera stolen by former IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) in Australia. As Ethan fights his growing attraction to Nyah, he in unable to prevent her falling into harm's way and before long, Ethan is caught in a deadly race against time to prevent the virus being unleashed and to find the antidote to save Nyah's life.After so much criticism of the first movie's overly-complicated plot, it's no real surprise that Mission Impossible 2 is dumber than lighting a match in a room full of dynamite. This has Woo's stamp all over it, feeling like a wish-list of action scenes and death-defying stunts crammed between slow-mo shots of doves and needlessly stylish shots devoid of dialogue. It has nothing at all to do with the Mission Impossible series, something which parts one and three at least attempt.

The intense focus of the movie on the personality of a single character, almost to the exclusion of the other characters, is reminiscent of Citizen Kane. Like Citizen Kane, the main character's personality is allowed to speak for itself and the viewer is left to interpret what the character's actions mean as best they can; like in real life, there are no easy answers that sum up who a person is.It is this ambiguity that makes Taxi Driver such an engaging and intelligent film, as the viewer has to think for themselves about who Travis Bickle is, and what his motivations are. Reviewing the comments at IMDb shows that everyone draws their own conclusions.I think he is and always was dangerously psychotic. I think his loneliness is self-created and not the fault of society; he is not shunned by his fellow taxi drivers when he approaches them, but never tries to be friendly with him. He has the capacity to meet people; after all, when he tries he walks straight into an office and picks up a gorgeous woman. Yet he can't maintain a normal relationship because he makes no attempt to maintain normal human interests like music and films; all he does to amuse himself is go to porno theaters. But neither is he unambiguously bad; he reaches out to a child prostitute and tries to help her. He is a flawed and complex person.In the end he is hailed as a hero for freeing her and killing her pimps. In my opinion, people miss the significance of this ending. If all we knew about Travis Bickle came from the brief period of time when he thrust himself on the publics attention by killing pimps and helping a child prostitute, wouldn't we be inclined to view him as a vigilante hero, like the cop who breaks the rules and gets the bad guy while suspended? But it's only because we've seen his prior behavior, when he was a nobody and when nobody paid attention to him, that we can put his actions into context and see that his actions were motivated more by rage against the world and a desire for attention than any desire for justice. He could have just as well killed the senator and been a villain instead.The acting, casting and cinematography of this film are all excellent. But for me what really puts this film on top and gives it a 10\/10 is that is has the ambiguity and depth that rewards thinking and repeated viewing, that makes it engaging rather than being just something to watch.

With Reds under beds and paranoia at it's highest level until The Bay Of Pigs incident & The Cuban Missile Crisis, this movie fitted the time it was made. The height of The Cold War and neither side looked like backing down made this film what it was then.Sadly now with the fall of the USSR, Glasnost and the ACE treaty this could never happen. B-52's no longer circle in constant readiness having been superseded by ICBM's and even those are constantly being disarmed.The entire plot revolves around the idea that one rogue US General decides to start World War 3 all by himself by issuing irrevocable orders. This is of course ridiculous as the only thing required to stop the very slow Bombers is to scramble very fast Fighter jets after them and blow the Bombers out of the sky which would be done as soon as The Pengtagon found they were unable to communicate with the Bombers to recall them. They would willingly sacrifice their own Bombers rather than risk a full scale nuclear war.The 1st mistake is a General wouldn't command a Wing, it would be a Colonel. The US equivalent rank of Mandrake would be a Colonel. The 2nd mistake is General Ripper telling Group Captain Mandrake (Peter Sellars) to implement Plan R for Robert (when he should say Romeo and an officer of his experience should have known that). Mandrake should have refused to follow the order for that reason alone (Incorrect procedure). Fortunately the actors in the plane do NOT make the same mistake.Likewise General Turgison's phone conversation with Colonel Puntridge is a mistake as it would never take place over an insecure line with the topic they are discussing. Ripper's tannoy to the base is also incorrect (no matter what, he would never say Commie over a tannoy, he'd more likely say The Enemy).Mandrake soon finds out there is no state of war by listening to his own radio and goes to see what's happening. Kong's message over the flight intercom telling all the men about the radio frequency is wrong. Each man has those orders printed in front of him and would know that frequency from them, him telling them over the intercom risks that frequency being overheard. Likewise he would not give the target over the frequency or warhead yield for the same reason.The Plan R they discuss in the war room is now an outdated concept since the introduction of ICBM's as they are programmed to fire without human operators to give MAD (mutally assured destruction). An Army Unit is ordered to take Ripper's base and put him in contact with the War Room, the base troops of course think anyone attacking are Russians in disguise because of what Ripper told them (another ridiculous idea).The Russians reveal their Doomsday machine and it is explained to the US President (Peter Sellars) by Dr Strangelove (Peter Sellars). In the shots where Rippers office is being shot at there are several times where Ripper should be hit and killed. After his men surrender, Ripper shoots himself to make sure the recall codes can't be found and the Bombers can't be bought back. Now, if the missile that was fired at Kong's B-52 was a nuke, it would have been unable to finish it's mission once it detonated (even though it didn't actually hit them). The EMP would have destroyed all the on-board electronics forcing the B-52 to land. This destroys the radio and the B-52 can now no longer communicate with the outside world (the pilot should have immediately stood down from his mission).The B-52 Navigator is played by James Earl Jones in his 1st ever movie role. The recall code is given (having been worked out by Mandrake from a note on Ripper's desk) and acknowledged by 30 planes and with 4 shot down all planes are accounted for until The Russians admit 1 plane may have only been damaged (Kong's B-52). When they discover they don't have enough fuel to even hit their primary target, Kong's B-52 should turn back but Kong is determined to hit any target no matter what and diverts to an ICBM complex at Kodlos (now if The Russians were using ICBM's what was the point of the Americans using B-52's which were much slower?). A really huge mistake is Kong ordering an air-burst attack but then setting detonation altitude at zero feet (or ground level, so hardly an air-burst!).On finding the bomb doors have failed Kong has yet ANOTHER reason to to stand down (especially after both manual opening fails and explosive opening fails) but doesn't. By refusing to stand down by this point Kong far exceeded any field authority he had as Captain. His co-pilot, navigator and bombardier should have all ordered him to stand down and in fact relieved him of his command for refusing to do so.Now without this film Dark Star would not exist and Alien would have never been made.The height the bomb was dropped from it would never have time to arm itself. The ending of discussing how to continue life in mine shafts (there must have been a huge section cut where they said the Doomsday Device went off) and the shots of all the nuclear bombs is a very weak ending indeed in a generally bad film which isn't funny and hasn't stood the passage of time well at all.

It takes only the most basic thematic elements of the original, and then takes them in an almost completely different direction. Carpenter gives us a film that is not as taut or suspenseful as the 1951 version, but it is light years ahead of that film in terms of f\/x. This film is a lot more moody and ambiguous, as well. This time, we aren't dealing with an actual man from mars. We are dealing with an organism that can take the form of any living creature. The dozen or so cast members seldom have any idea which of them is human or a reproduction until it's too late.The film begins with a couple of Norwegians in a helicopter shooting at a snow dog from the air. Had the guy with the rifle been an even half-way decent shot, maybe the events of this film would have never even happened. Anyway, the dog makes it to an American compound nearby on the frozen tundra of Antarctica. The Norwegians are unable to explain the dangers associated with allowing this dog inside the camp, and the two are soon dead. Within a few hours, the organism from another world spreads through the dog population in the American camp on to the human crew. The cast starts dropping like flies in some incredibly gory ways as their bodies are taken over by this hostile life form that seems bent on conquering all life on earth. The brutal cold and isolation of this Antarctica outpost don't make survival any easier for the crew, and time is quickly running out on them. Do any of them survive? Watch and see. You may have to draw your own conclusions, however.Is the film frightening? Absolutely. The original film relied more on suspense. The scares in Carpenter's film come mostly from gore-related shocks. Rob Bottin's wonderful creature work has to be seen to be believed. These were the days when you couldn't just sit back and rely on CGI. You had to actually construct these monsters and find a way to make them move convincingly. The gore f\/x here are incredible. The cast and acting are uniformly excellent. We get to know enough about virtually everyone who lasts long enough to care about. Kurt Russell is top-billed and gives a typically great performance. He looks to be hiding under about three year's worth of facial hair. Wilford Brimley stands out in an early role for him. T.K. Carter found a lot of work back in those days, and I had not realized that Keith David got any good parts like this so far back in his career.Is this a great film? Not quite. There are some glaring flaws. The film is allowed to cheat by never really explaining just how the creature can morph so easily from one person to the next. Also there are typically dumb moments where the characters split up when they should obviously stick together considering what they know about the enemy organism. The film looks wonderful, and it has some nice homage scenes to the original here and there. Be warned, though. You will need a strong stomach for some of the gory scenes. The R rating is very well justified. In sum I'd recommend watching this film. It never seems to get shown on television anymore, so you may have to turn to Netflix or something similar to find it. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.

Once there, they learn that the ship is to be retired. When Dr. McCoy starts acting mysteriously, Spock's father, Sarek, informs Kirk that Spock's soul is inside McCoy, and in order to save both of his friends, he must go to Genesis! Kirk then asks Admiral Morrow if he can return to this planet, but permission is denied. Still determined to save Spock and McCoy, he and his crew risk their careers by stealing the Enterprise and heading for Genesis! Unfortunately, the Klingons discover the secrets of Project Genesis, and Kirk and his crew have another battle to face on their way to the planet! This third installment in the Star Trek movie franchise may have a rather lacklustre beginning, but it soon improves. It's not always consistent, and the script is not absolutely perfect, sometimes faltering, but the movie is rarely dull, with a good amount of excitement, along with a bit of humour, including the part where McCoy tries to do the Vulcan neck pinch, and some impressive effects as well.

I gave TWOK an 8\/10, and as you can see, I have given TSFS a 7\/10. I'm not sure whether I could give this film an 8\/10 or not. Nonetheless, even though this probably isn't the best installment in the Star Trek movie franchise, there's still plenty for fans to enjoy, so I give it a thumbs up, and think that fans who haven't seen it should.

It reminds us how aware we already were before watching it and makes us even more aware upon watching it that America has always been full of blind hate for things it hardly knows of, when those things may be innate parts of someone, both hoping and scared to be noticed and nonetheless only wanting acceptance. The Celluloid Closet, one of the most important documentaries I have ever seen, makes it clear that in over 100 years of movies, homosexuality has only been depicted on the screen every here and there and almost always as something to laugh at, or pity, or fear, thus hate. These images have always been momentary or subtle and passing, but they have left a deep imprint on America, and so the world. Lily Tomlin narrates, Hollywood taught straight people what to think about gay people, and gay people what to think about themselves. No one escaped its influence.Also, when you watch this film, you may hopefully slowly slip out of that defensive shell we as a culture have, a denial that movies affect us, or that any of that depends on age. This film proves beyond the shadow of a doubt how the subtlest alterations to a film and the slightest shades of attitudes can leave lasting conscious or subconscious imprints on us.The film takes us through the thrillingly interesting period of the 1950s, when screenwriters and directors acted almost as undercover operatives when slipping in the slightest ambiguous homosexual or bisexual undertones, the most shocking of which was Ben-Hur, and the staggeringly angering 1960s, but maybe the focal point of the movie's conclusion is that at the very beginning, starting with Thomas Edison's experimental film of two men dancing together and continuing sparingly through the silent era and shortly after, was a time when men were free to express tenderness with each other on the screen, but as the world grew more aware of homosexuality, affection between males would be seen as a completely unacceptable, shun-worthy act. Two guy friends can rarely even hold each other in a movie! However, there has always been a difference in how audiences look at two men being affectionate or sexual and two women being sexual. There's a comfort with female nudity and affectionate bonding that can be not only acceptable but considered sexy by the general public. Women somehow don't find it threatening the way it is with men, and men find it either completely nonthreatening or arousing, or both. Movies like The Color Purple, Personal Best and Thelma & Louise showcase things between two women that are still highly taboo between two men. Even hit movies like Philadelphia and Brokeback Mountain, which actually is not mentioned in this film only because this was released about a decade before it, are no true steps forward for homosexuality in cinema, because they are about the sadness and alienation of being gay, and, on a very obscure note in case someone hasn't seen one or either, they end with death.It remains to be seen whether or not Hollywood and American audiences will embrace a movie with a gay hero who lives, and can be integrated with other people. They are the only minority who has yet to be given solid recognition and voice in the most universal and popular form of entertainment and communication in our culture.

I wanted to like it, I really did. Gary Oldman is my favorite actor, and he's in fine form here, although his Sid Vicious accent degenerates into a kind of generic Brit accent by the end of the film. I was interested in the story of Sid and the Sex Pistols, but true to the title, the film focuses squarely on Sid's relationship with Nancy. The film assumes a general and broad knowledge of the life and events of Sid and the Sex Pistols. You get tidbits of reportedly 'real' happenings from infamous stories, but it plays out as a disconnected series of events, without any framework to ground you in the lives of any of the characters. The dialog is mostly semi-coherent drug-induced babbling while stumbling blindly from one downtrodden location to another. In short, the film, much like Sid's life, is a train-wreck. Is this intentional? Trying to capture the feeling of what it was like? Maybe, maybe not. But it's a moot point. The film's main fault is in failing to create any sympathy for it's characters. Unlike other films which show the unglamorous cycle of drug dependency such as Trainspotting and The Basketball Diaries, Sid & Nancy shows not one redeeming value in its 'protagonists'. I was actually grateful when Nancy is no longer a focus of the story because I couldn't stand hearing her whining and screaming on the screen anymore. I thought the end of the movie might pull it out and make the whole thing worthwhile now that the focus was squarely on Oldman. And what do I get instead? A meaningless sequence where he dances with children before a magical cab pulls up to escort him and his newly revived love off to Never-never-land. (Yes I'm aware the disco on the radio had meaning.) Well, this sequence is certainly a happier note to end on than what happened in real life. And why not toss in another sequence glorifying a destructive, co-dependent relationship based on drug use? Yes, the film has the audacity to imply that this is real love. If you're 13 and looking for a film to romanticize and justify your rebellious anti-everything feelings, and you have a lot of knowledge and fascination for Sid Vicious, you might enjoy this film. For everyone else, stay away. The details are fudged and fuzzy, the script is misguided, the directing is slipshod, and unless you just HAVE to see Courtney Love's first role, the acting isn't worth sitting through the film.

Directed by George Cukor with costumes by Cecil Beaton, it's a delicious extravaganza of beauty, elegance, comedy and glorious music.The film was made with a good deal of controversy when Julie Andrews, who had performed Eliza on Broadway, was not chosen to play the lead. Today it's hard to discern what the fuss was about. Actresses' singing voices had been dubbed for decades - suddenly there was this great uproar because Hepburn would have to be dubbed. Since Andrews was due to make her star film debut that same year in Mary Poppins, one suspects the hand of a publicist behind all the fury. Why hadn't anyone made a fuss when the pretty, highly-acclaimed Barbara Cook or other Broadway stars weren't allowed to recreate any of their Broadway roles? First of all, while Andrews was a brilliant Eliza on Broadway, she would have been much less successful on film, where the guttersnipe to princess transition would not have been anywhere near as dazzling. Who can forget Hepburn's entrance into Ascot or in her dress for the ball - she is breathtaking. Jack Warner's assertion that he needed a big female star for box office because Harrison wasn't big enough was always baloney. People would have flocked to see My Fair Lady for itself; it's one of the most famous musicals of all time, and back then, probably the most famous. The controversy was so intimidating that Hepburn didn't accept the role until she heard that Elizabeth Taylor was going to be offered the part. She then figured if there was no way Warner was hiring Andrews, she may as well do it. She was dubbed by Marni Nixon, who had dubbed singing for Marilyn Monroe, Natalie Wood, and Deborah Kerr - and no one had blinked.The film is an orgy of color in Beaton's gorgeous costumes and in his production design. Cukor's direction is assured and keeps the film moving at a good pace. Seeing it today, perhaps the biggest surprise is Jeremy Brett as Freddy. It's very hard to realize that this was Public Television's Sherlock Holmes as we look at his unlined face and watch his juvenile manner. He's wonderful, if wasted. When researching the Audrey Hepburn book by Barry Paris, I had the great pleasure of interviewing Brett shortly before his death. A gracious, friendly man. Every actor is perfectly cast, Holloway repeating his Broadway success as Eliza's father, Gladys Cooper the ideal dowager mother, Wilfred Hyde-White the dry-humored, straightforward Pickering. Rex Harrison's Professor Higgins stands as one of the best performances ever done on Broadway, and one that made the sing-speak type of singing legitimate. After seeing countless, excellent performers do Higgins, no one has ever come up to Harrison's. He makes the misogynistic, snobbish, cold, sarcastic, irascible character so believable that it's a shock when he comes down from his pedestal near the end of the film -- and somehow is equally believable.Audrey Hepburn gives Eliza great warmth and vulnerability, making her very appealing and sympathetic to the audience. As mentioned before, her transformation is stunning, and as both a guttersnipe and a lady, she is very strong. Hepburn believed she was going to be given a chance to sing Eliza, and there are tapes of her rehearsing with the orchestra. This was often done in Hollywood to jolly along the performer - of course, no one ever had any intention of letting her sing. Perhaps, in retrospect, the powers that be should have used her voice through Eliza's guttersnipe period, where it would have been appropriate. With some mixing in the recording studio, she would have been fine. Later, when the role becomes that of a true soprano, there was really no choice - but even there, there were opportunities to use Hepburn's voice - in more of Just You Wait, Henry Higgins and Show Me.

The story is expressionist because it is told from the point of view of the reporter who is trying to piece together the pieces of a puzzle regarding the life of Charles Foster Kane. The only clue the reporter has is the last word that Kane utters before he dies; it is that word that may hold the key to revealing the real Charles Foster Kane. Kane's public persona is a sham covering up a personality that is an enigma. The movie consists of a series of flashbacks as told by the people who were closest to Kane, and who despised him the most. The depicts Kane's life as a series of montages, with wide-angled and close-ups rapidly interspersed, depending on what feeling the movie is trying to evoke, all of which together convey the impression of a jumbled life in which the pieces don't quite fit together. At the start, Kane is young, dynamic, and determined to make things happen; by the end, he is defeated, deflated and behaving like a child. He is angry by the way he was rejected by his parents and has contempt for money, which he associates with the banker-guardian who Kane despises. Kane dedicates his life to spending as much money as he can, and in doing whatever it takes to maintain control, including building a palace and housing it with as many artifacts as he can buy as a way of insulating himself from a world which he finds hostile to him. Kane's life goes into a tailspin after he is caught cheating on his wife, destroying his reputation and revealing him as being a hypocrite. His second marriage, to his mistress, is also a disaster as Kane bullies her into becoming an opera singer just to prove to the world that he had in fact married a singer. He tries to buy her love and when she leaves him, he completely falls apart, utterly alone and unloved, having driven away the last person who had still cared for him. To suggest that Kane deliberately and maliciously used people would not be entirely correct. He was driven to act by psychological forces that distorted his ability to get close with people and ultimately led to his demise. As for the word rosebud, the reported never finds out what that word meant, but the meaning is revealed to the audience, leaving the audience knowing something that the reporter does not know. Citizen Kane is a remarkable movie. It has withstood the test of time, meaning that the movie is not dated and presents a story that would resonant with today's audience, in fact even more so that when the movie was first released in 1941. The acting is great and the cinematography is astounding. Who really was Charles Foster Kane? He had so much money and was known as a man of the people yet was alone. The acting is great. Dorothy Comingore's performance is especially powerful. Her role is the key to the movie. Actually this movie could have more aptly been titled Mrs. Citizen Kane because of the central role of Ms. Comingore's character. The story is as much about her as about Kane. The movie is timeless, its themes universal and contains performances that cover the gamut of human emotions.
