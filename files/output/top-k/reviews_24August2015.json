[{"date":"24 August 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I have seen many promos with this movie on television, and was curious to see it. Sadly, I didn't, so I guess you can say that I was lazy for not seeing it. No matter, I did see this on HBO and watch this many times as it aired as a 24 hour marathon on Cartoon Network when Warner Bros and Cartoon Network were promoting The Powerpuff Girls Movie with a music video during the end credits of The Iron Giant. The movie itself feels timeless, and I know this movie will continue to find an audience despite of its failure at the box office when it first came out in theaters. I am more than happy that this movie has a cult following, and there many fans that are embracing it. With that said, The Iron Giant its about a boy named Hogarth Hughes who lives with his mother Annie a waitress has discovered a giant metallic robot, who fell from space and befriends him. A beatnik artist Dean McCoppin looks out for the Giant at a junkyard, but federal agent Kent Mansley wants to find the Giant and destroy it. The movie is itself is like Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra Terrestrial, but it acts very much its own movie. I continue to love this movie as I watch it, and I see nothing wrong about it. The movie does look gorgeous in widescreen as it gives it a much epic feel to it in a CinemaScope format. As much as we love animated movies in CGI like Pixar or DreamWorks, but I do think its beautiful to see an animated movie to be all done traditionally by hand instead of having it all done by a computer. The animation is again beautiful with all the rich colors, and details that were all put into this movie. I do love how the movie looks as the movie takes place in 1957. The movie does have some funny moments, and I guess a bit edgy for an animated movie that features some curse words. The movie is made for kids, but its something that adults would enjoy. Hey, when I first saw this movie, I didn't expect to hear any curse words in an animated movie which I thought it was going to be a clean animated movie like what Disney did with their animated movies. I guess both Bird and Warner Bros. want it to take it up a notch. The movie is rated PG, and nothing to be worrying about. Or shocking for that matter. I do love the characters, and really love the way they're designed. Also, I thought it had great voice acting. Jennifer Aniston; Harry Connick, Jr.; Eli Marienthal and Christopher McDonald were all really good for their own roles. Vin Diesel, I thought, was perfectly cast for voicing the Iron Giant, and can't imagine any one voicing it aside from Diesel. Michael Kamen's score to the movie is very good, and nothing more that I can say about. I love its story and the direction that the filmmakers went, and I think its perfectly executed. This is Brad Bird's greatest achievement, and should be given a lot of credit for making this wonderful movie. I have heard that Bird and Warner Bros. are both working on bringing this movie for a limited release this year on September the 30th, and October the 4th for remastering it and presenting two new scenes for the movie. This new cut will be called The Iron Giant Signature Edition. I am very excited about it, and would love to see this on the big screen like I never had before. I love The Iron Giant, and I am giving this movie a 10 out of 10.

Watch the lobotomized, badly acted, boring piece of crap sequel. Look, if you are so inventive, could you stop stealing our movies and turning them into crap? Put down the comic book, write something original like this generation did. An action movie rises or falls predicated upon its villains; this has two excellent ones Dick Jones and Clarence. They can act, by the way, as can Weller. He doesn't look and sound like he had a massive stroke with a glassy eyed, dumb ass stare. Verhoeven fills the movie with biting, trenchant satire the breadth of the entire 80s Yuppies culture. Weller makes you care about him with his acting ability coupled with the real suffering Clarence and the boys mete out to him. The alliance between Jones and Clarence is well developed and understandable not introduced and then disappearing; I don't know maybe they ran out of crayons for the new script? When you compare both of the Vorhoeven's treasures that were bastardized by the lobotomies, this and Total Recall, what you notice, right away, is the drop in intellectual content. This movie is not just a great action picture; note, it contains action, not four scenes, two of which are training exercises. The acting, writing and directing are so superior. Satire requires much more intelligence than a straightforward narrative.This movie moves very well, has biting satire with great humor. Ferrer's Bob Morton is worth owning the movie for, what a depiction of a cut throat take no prisoners executive. I will be honest with you, it was after watching the abomination that is the remake, that I really appreciated this movie more. As soon as I was done, I put this one in to cleanse my mind. Yes, all of Vorhoeven's movies are quite violent, this is certainly no exception. It also is quite intense, fast moving and you will not be bored for one minute. Even with the dated effects, the dialog is funny and sarcastic. Weller's acting ability dwarfs lobotomy boy. The new guy has this expressionless insouciance devoid of one scintilla of inflection in his voice. For everyone who has not seen the remake, watch it then watch this over, believe me, you will have a new found respect for Vorhoeven's film. Cox out-acts Keaton badly in comparison, it is not even close. The real difference is the intelligence of the writing everything is in the proper place and depth. We get his assembly but it doesn't consume half the movie. Also, his trip back to his family is but a detour here, in the remake it eats twenty minutes out of the film.You have no idea how utterly brain dead the remake is until you revisit this movie. All the cutting jabs at our culture, the intense corporate infighting and throat cutting which gave the original its bite has been castrated out of the remake. This movie is also free of the Deus Ex Machina ontology for retards that we have to endure in the remake. Look, it is RoboCop not Being and Nothingness? They think if they throw ontological babble at you it makes up for a boring, badly acted piece of crap. The cast and the writing are the stars of this film. Weller, Cox, Ferrer and Kurtwood Smith tower over the cheese ball group of a no talented ensemble with the exception of Oldman. Keaton is so lost in the remake; hey, he tried menacing in Pacific Heights, it is out of his range, Hello? Do yourself a big favor, make yourself watch the Curious George version of RoboCop before you re-watch this classic. A Very Good Cutting Satire.A Wise Man Strives For Clarity; A Fool For Obscurity.

You will wonder why this has happened and what action(s) to take. The question of what to do when you learn your spouse is having an affair will have a different answer at different times and under different circumstances. What you should do in your specific situation might be a lot different from what someone else should consider doing, but in most cases, it starts by deciding what you really want to take place, and why you want the answer. If you have decided to divorce quietly, move to another country (or planet) and just forget the whole ordeal, what you should probably do to make that happen smoothly will be a lot different than if you really want to know if you're likely to still be married to the same partner 10, 20 or more years from now. As a guess, you aren't online looking for advice that supports that choice, since that path seems pretty clear for most people, once chosen.Assuming that what you are really looking for is advice to help your marriage survive, let me make a few suggestions about what you can actually do.When i met my husband then it crystal clear to me that he was the man of my dream. When i looked at him, i saw perfection. He was tall, respectful, looked at me like i was the only one on earth i mean words cannot describe that moment that is the day we met. It lives on here in my head. I know i was not blind and i know there was nothing really to make me suspect he also like the company of men as well as women. Yes i mean we were sexually active just like every other normal couple who are in love. It never seem like he was avoiding me when i want to have *** like he always comes up with excuse no he was just like every other man. I only got to know when i was two years into our marriage. The first year was healthy for us i mean we were happy and had our first child. It was my sister who caught him passionately kissing another man his car after spending all night together in the movie theater. He told me he was going out with friends for a drink or two. I was hurt because he was not honest with me and also was cheating on me. Even before i knew, this thing he had going on started before we got married at least he was honest about that. Hadn't been my sister, i would have been locked in the dark. I have nothing against same sex relationship but when you claim to love a woman and also want to be with a man it becomes a problem i mean you are either with one or the other. You can't be married to me and expect me to shear you with another be it a woman or a man. We promise we will stay together just us and not us with some one else. I gave him an ultimatum it was either me or his male love i was hoping his love for me will make him pick me but no he ended our marriage simply before he could not pick. He wanted it all i wished i never made him choose then. I was in a traumatized i could not understand how he could be so selfish i mean we have a son together you don't just walk out like that. I remember i even asked him to go ahead with relationship with his lover as long as he was here with me but then i realized i would be at the losing end in all ways. I was so much in love with him letting him go was not an option for me i mean i knew that if it wasn't him it was going to me no other. After months of trying and searching with no success to find a way to make him see i am more important than his lover i came across a lot of comments on the internet of how a spell caster Akpe Osilama and how he has help a lot of individual with relationship and life problems. I was skeptical about it but i thought giving it a try would not kill me. What can i say, my experience with Akpe Osilama was real, honest i mean everything that was said about him was nothing but all true. I shared my problem with him that is how my husband ended our marriage because i was not OK with him have a male lover even when we were married and what i needed him to do for me. I got the materials to get the spell that was going to get me my husband. I could only find one of the spell materials but he help me get the rest with the total estimated cost i sent to him for help. I don't know how to explain what happen just after the spell process was concluded and made effective with the parcel he sent to me. I was like a fairy tale i mean i got my love back my family was whole again. My husband picked me he choose to be with me. It been more than six months now all i can see is a man loves and dedicate his self to me he goes every where with me aside work though yeah. Contact him here at chiefpriestakpeosilamaspellcastatyahoodotcom convert email address to the standard email format. Hope you all with similar problem and any kind of mess you find yourself in life get all help from Akpe Osilama also.

I remember i even asked him to go ahead with relationship with his lover as long as he was here with me but then i realized i would be at the losing end in all ways. I was so much in love with him letting him go was not an option for me i mean i knew that if it wasn't him it was going to me no other. After months of trying and searching with no success to find a way to make him see i am more important than his lover i came across a lot of comments on the internet of how a spell caster Akpe Osilama and how he has help a lot of individual with relationship and life problems. I was skeptical about it but i thought giving it a try would not kill me. What can i say, my experience with Akpe Osilama was real, honest i mean everything that was said about him was nothing but all true. I shared my problem with him that is how my husband ended our marriage because i was not OK with him have a male lover even when we were married and what i needed him to do for me. I got the materials to get the spell that was going to get me my husband. I could only find one of the spell materials but he help me get the rest with the total estimated cost i sent to him for help. I don't know how to explain what happen just after the spell process was concluded and made effective with the parcel he sent to me. I was like a fairy tale i mean i got my love back my family was whole again. My husband picked me he choose to be with me. It been more than six months now all i can see is a man loves and dedicate his self to me he goes every where with me aside work though yeah. Contact him here at chiefpriestakpeosilamaspellcastatyahoodotcom convert email address to the standard email format. Hope you all with similar problem and any kind of mess you find yourself in life get all help from Akpe Osilama also. I also hope this comment will help a lot of you trying to keep your marriage bond strong.\/\/ ","genre":"Crime, Film-Noir, Thriller"},{"date":"24 August 2015","score":"","review":" I've written about Tarantino a lot of times, which is allowed because he's one of the most famous directors in the world. And with the release of the trailer for his 8th (rumoured to be his last) movie, Hateful Eight, it seems fair to wax lyrical over his first, breakout film, Reservoir Dogs. One of those films that needs to be watched twice, Reservoir Dogs gained Tarantino a lot of attention in Hollywood, for all the reasons that Tarantino has since become globally renowned. Plenty of blood which keeps your eyes fixed on the screen, plenty of swearing which makes it difficult to zone out, and a plot that doesn't go very far but develops the story and characters subtly. The reason I say it needs to be watched twice isn't due to subtle clues alluding to the finale that can only be noticed once you've already watched it, like Fight Club or Usual Suspects, but simply that Reservoir Dogs is a bad movie the first time through. OK not a bad movie, but as I mentioned previously, the actual time line of the film only lasts about an hour, so it stands to reason that it would be difficult to fit much action or drama into that short a space of time. The film is about a diamond robbery, and at no point in the 99 minute run time do we see any form of robbery occurring. People anticipating a movie with plenty of fighting and action will be disappointed, and those who can't stand a movie which refuses to move from a single location will be in tears. But those people who can focus on every detail, and every piece of dialogue, will be rewarded with one of the greatest movies they will ever see. The movie begins with a bunch of gangsters sitting in a coffee shop, discussing Like a Virgin by Madonna, and tipping. Innocuous conversation between apparent life-long friends, before walking off into the sunset to the sound of Little Green Bag. The credits roll, and you wonder if you're watching the right movie. Then, as if on cue, the screen is filled with blood, a screaming man, and instant tension. It's impossible to look away, as the viewer must find out what went so horribly wrong with whatever it was these well- dressed men were up to. All is explained surely enough, and this is another of the films strengths. The gang of gangsters have conducted a diamond theft, which went wrong when one of the gangsters started shooting people he shouldn't. The police arrive, all hell breaks loose, and the gang must return to a secret warehouse to regroup (the warehouse being the main set for the majority of the movie). Once here, they work out one by one that they have been set up by a mole in the group, an undercover cop. It is at this point that the audience is assuming the rest of the movie will be trying to work out who the cop is. What's unexpected though at this stage is that the mole is revealed, and dramatic irony is flowing through, as the audience knows the cop, but no one else does. This leaves the story wide open, but it is clear that a climax is imminent, and there must one last twist in this tale to leave us feeling stunned. There is no twist, but the ending is no less shocking, over the top, inevitable, but no less perfectly crafted. One of the factors causing this is the cast. The gangsters include names which have since been involved in most other Tarantino films. Michael Madsen, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Chris Penn all give excellent performances, but the standout was Steve Buscemi. He plays Mr Pink, and is the one guy you're designed to hate the whole way through. He complains about tipping waitresses at the beginning of the movie, which was unheard of in the USA in the 90's, as tipping your waitress was as important as paying for the meal itself. He seems to coward his way out of dangerous situations, and just seems like the one guy in the group that, despite them all being long-term criminals, you just wouldn't want to spend any time with. What's truly excellent, and I'm sure its intentional, is that Buscemi's character is styled and acted in such a way as to look as much like a rodent as possible, with the pencil moustache and slicked back hair. And when the finale comes in and guns are fired, Mr Pink manages to slink away unscathed. The definition of a rat, in the gangster community, is that it will do everything in its power to survive, typified by Buscemi's character. It's this sort of attention to detail, among other things, that makes this movie so re-watchable, that while there is very little visual action, the movie itself is a work of art. The soundtrack is understandably legendary, the dialogue is engrossing, and the ending catches you out every single time.

But boy, did I cheer the soldier in this story! The filmmakers did a fine job to build sympathy for him from the moment the viewer laid eyes on him. He's handsome, tall and the kind of person with that boy-next-door appearance. It is really a tightly-knitted film in which you wonder from the opening scene, about the son, whose mother longingly stares down the one road into their home town. Having the opportunity to follow his journey, we really get a sense about his upbringing, his hopes and dreams, and where his heart lies. I dare not divulge too much, because it was such a treat to see how this young man undertakes a journey to try and see his mother. As for calling this a war story, it's not the kind that we might picture the John Wayne flicks, or ones like, Saving Private Ryan, for instance. There's not much violence in this film, at all.Rather than a film with attitude, it's a film of the heart. And BALLAD certainly has heart. This film delivers with a terrific story line, in which the filmmakers help the viewer open their hearts up to those of the main characters. Witty combinations of humor and nostalgia transcend borders, giving the viewer a sense of wanting to know many of the people portrayed in this film. Why, I actually searched for further information about the lead players, and my heart dropped when I learned that both of the main talents recently passed away in real life. In a sense, it felt as if I had lost two genuine friends. BALLAD gives us the opportunity to see the two lead characters in their first roles. They were simply mesmerizing on film, which has preserved them in time. The players had little to no experience, yet their screen presence showed tenderness, charm and power. Please do yourselves a favor. If you're sitting on the fence about whether to watch BALLAD, go ahead and watch it. Even if it was a film to showcase Communism and the motherland of Russia, I didn't care. I really argued whether to give this a perfect score, but just couldn't do it. And I'm trying to express why, yet I can't. I'd like to pick apart an obvious shot using models instead of real equipment, or maybe the shot of either lead looking through a window as trees reflected. Or perhaps the ending, which seemed a bit abrupt? It's the ending. I guess I wanted something a little more, or different. How nice it was, upon reflection, to watch an almost flawless film.

Bridges is marvellous in his role as the curious and likable alien &#x96; a well- deserved Oscar nomination was given to him. In fact, he's the only actor in a John Carpenter movie to be nominated for an Oscar.

Though on paper this looks like a very sill movie, it turns out to be of the most touching and funny love stories from the 80's. Carpenter purists may look down upon this film for its family- friendly appeal and PG rating but he showed real maturity in Starman by keeping an emphasising on close human emotions rather than shocks and special effects. As a lot of alien films do, Starman asks questions about our nature as human beings and our impact on planet Earth. It does so in a way, however, without getting preachy. It's moving, in fact, as is the romance. And this is coming from a guy who generally despises romantic films. Best Scene Like most Carpenter films, Starman has a memorable ending. In this case, the film closes on Allen's face, full of wonder, as she looks up at the mothership taking Bridges home.

We get great performances from Patrick Swayze, Randy Travis, Meatloaf, Gabriel Casseus and Graham Beckel. Also of-mention is Crews' daughter, played by 11-year-old Erin Broderick. She just had a special something and lit up every scene with her in it.Swayze plays the part to a T of a basically-decent person, just-released from a 2-year prison stint, and is obviously traumatized by both the incarceration and the knowledge that his negligence killed someone. I think his was a socially-important part, because herein, we see the effect of over-working, as one tries to create a decent life for one's family.Randy Travis plays his part well, never over-acting, and always imbuing his words and actions with the sense of calm and humor he is known for in music circles. I enjoyed him in 1997's Fire Down Below, and in The Black Dog, he gets a much more substantial role, and much more screen time. His references to song writing and singing were humorous.Meatloaf is the surprise of the movie. His role as religion-crazed black marketeer plays excellent counter-point to the other, more-reserved characters in the movie. It was great to see Gabriel Casseus (as undercover F.B.I agent). I admired his work in 2000's Bedazzled and would like to see more of his work. I was not familiar with Graham Beckel, who plays the arms-dealing mastermind in The Black Dog, but whoever did casting for the movie knew a good bad guy when they saw one. Not being a trucker, I'm not sure if some of the driving stunts Crews pulled off are possible.., or not, but the scene with him getting out of the cab and swinging outside the cab over to the fifth wheel to fight a bad guy is definitely something to see. It was definitely Swayze.., not a stunt double.I have never understood how a moving vehicle can hit a stationary object (like a mobile home) and then fly over it, spinning, but the good news is that I don't have to. The Black Dog is a good action movie with a special cast and a couple of important social messages 1.) Don't fore-close on people's house (and family), because they will do whatever it takes to keep their life. and 2.) Do not demand inhumane hours and effort from your employees, because they could pop. ","genre":null},{"date":"24 August 2015","score":"","review":" I think the best part of this movie was the acting.

","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"24 August 2015","score":"","review":" I think the best part of this movie was the acting. We get great performances from Patrick Swayze, Randy Travis, Meatloaf, Gabriel Casseus and Graham Beckel. Also of-mention is Crews' daughter, played by 11-year-old Erin Broderick. She just had a special something and lit up every scene with her in it.Swayze plays the part to a T of a basically-decent person, just-released from a 2-year prison stint, and is obviously traumatized by both the incarceration and the knowledge that his negligence killed someone. I think his was a socially-important part, because herein, we see the effect of over-working, as one tries to create a decent life for one's family.Randy Travis plays his part well, never over-acting, and always imbuing his words and actions with the sense of calm and humor he is known for in music circles. I enjoyed him in 1997's Fire Down Below, and in The Black Dog, he gets a much more substantial role, and much more screen time. His references to song writing and singing were humorous.Meatloaf is the surprise of the movie. His role as religion-crazed black marketeer plays excellent counter-point to the other, more-reserved characters in the movie. It was great to see Gabriel Casseus (as undercover F.B.I agent). I admired his work in 2000's Bedazzled and would like to see more of his work. I was not familiar with Graham Beckel, who plays the arms-dealing mastermind in The Black Dog, but whoever did casting for the movie knew a good bad guy when they saw one.

The closer Gordon gets to Christine, the further away he movies from his friend and family, and in doing so opens up the chance for the viewers to side with best friend Stockwell, who is apprehensive of Gordon's fixation with the car.

Dahl's novel, which with its scant, succinct, read-in-a-couple-of-hours subtlety, nuance and subversion matches the entire Harry Potter canon, is ironically the victim of the very authoritarianism it encorages subverting. Matilda the movie contains so many revisions and diminishments to and of Dahl's story as to be a completely different tale. The text Based on... in the credits of a movie has become so common that few people give any thought to the source material. In the case of Matilda the movie vs. Matilda the book this is not only unfortunate, it is a dis-service to their children and to any parents who value having their children learn, understand and engage in critical thinking. And the possible Spoilers begin---1)Matilda the book Matilda is the daughter\/sister of shallow, materialistic, vacuous parents and brother; the worst possible common-denominator of the Me Generation of the 1980's. They are not the inevitable result of their era, the Wormwoods have made choices that result in both their vapidity and perhaps as counter-balance, Matilda. ---1A)Matilda the movie Matilda is the daughter\/sister of cartoons. One-dimensional, stupid to the point of begging the viewer to question how such adults could achieve adulthood much less be thriving, these caricatures raise the first of many questions Where is the cleverness, the craftiness Dahl provides the Wormwoods? ---2)Matilda the book Matilda's reading exposes her to thought processes, ideas, concepts, motives not generally available to elementary school age children. Her favorite author is Charles Dickens, and from him and other writers she develops an intuitive understanding that the world is not in balance. ---2A)Matilda the movie Matilda reads voraciously, but what does she learn from that reading?---3) Matilda the book Ah-Ha! A critical idea emerges; Matilda, through her reading has obtained crucial insight into adult motives, behavior, actions. She develops the understanding that size and age are not impervious barriers to ethical and moral actions. ---3B) Matilda the movie Matilda is inspired by her amoral, criminal father to consider the possibility that she (a child) is as much a person (and therefore as powerful) as any adult.An aside Which is more potent, more effective, more persistent, sustainable? Insight or information?---4) Matilda the book Matilda makes scant use of her powers. ---4A) Matilda the movie Matilda dances about, moving furniture, controlling electrical switches, ad infinitum... and directly relevant to... ---4.b) Matilda the book the first time Matilda seeks to demonstrate her powers to Miss Honey, she succeeds. Miss Honey is never, ever doubtful of Matilda's abilities. ---4.A.b) Matilda the movie Matilda is unsuccessful in her early attempt to demonstrate her ability to Miss Honey. And the Hollywood-ization of Matilda takes it first big step.---5A) Matilda the movie the entire, long, drawn out episode of Matilda psychically invading Trunchbull's (yes, I know) house is contrived. No version of it exists in Dahl's book. This sequence is the most shameless, pandering and demeaning scene in the film (although it has credible competition for this dishonor). ---5) Matilda the book Nothing like this scene occurs in Dahl's novel, for good reason. Matilda's power, its existence and her use of it is, as will be evidenced at the story's end, purposeful, deliberate...righteous.An aside In Matilda the movie Matilda has magic powers which she maintains after the story's climax. In Matilda the book, Matilda is never able to manifest her telekinetic ability after she rectifies the wrongs committed against Miss Honey. I suggest that the movie's ending is much less spiritual than Dahl intended.---6) Matilda the book Having overcome Trunchbull and redressing the wrongs committed against Miss Honey, Matilda never again manifests her telekinesis, suggesting the ability was specific to a situation...that is, spiritual. ---6B) Matilda the movie Matilda continues to demonstrates telekinetic ability, which would beg the questions What will a human with such power do?, How will Matilda affect and influence the world?, etc., etc., etc..And lastly, but not leastly---7B) Matilda the movie In Dahl's book Matilda is never mean or malicious. The treatment of Trunchbull at the film's climax depicts an act of vengeance severely out of character with Matilda's nature and her manifestation of her telekinetic ability. It is consistent with the Hollywood-ization of the story in that it provides a slapstick, child-pleasing and child-accessible conclusion. ---7A) Matilda the book Matilda earns an understanding of empowerment, but also learns that the power she had and used was a metaphor for being responsible, intelligent, clever, wise, compassionate...all the traits she sought in the adults around her.Even granting that the movie versions of books are generally criticized for the liberties, variances and accommodations that are part of getting the movie made, Matilda, the movie, is too much a violation of its source to be worthy of viewing.

You'd be treated to a newsreel, a cartoon, a short, previews, and then a double-feature, which included a B movie (typically just over an hour long) followed by the main feature (one featuring A-list actors and the top screenwriters and directors of the day). How different from today's multiplex dogma of showing just one feature as many times as possible throughout the course of a day.B movies were often horror films, Three Stooges shorts, westerns (in the early years), or serials (such as Andy Hardy or Charlie Chan), the main features would be the expensive musicals, dramas, and other big-budget productions. B movies were even made by separate studios. MGM and Paramount would never stoop to producing B movies. Whereas B movies were produced by the long-defunct Monogram Pictures, Republic Pictures, and others. While the B movies were usually shot on shoestring budgets, and often featured actors unknown to most Americans, some of them have become classics. One such B movie classic is Edgar Ulmer's 1945 flick, Detour. Starring Tom Neal as a drifter hitchhiking his way across the country, Detour takes his character, Al (no last name required), through a series of missteps which serve to tighten the proverbial noose of classic film noir around his neck until the (basically) decent man is faced with spending perhaps the rest of his life behind bars. First, Al is picked up by a pill-popping bookie who accidentally dies when Al is driving. Fearing the police will assume Al killed the bookie, he steals the car and the man's identity. We can call this Mistake #1. Mistake #2 occurs when he picks up a female hitchhiker named Vera, a woman with no apparent moral standards, who blackmails Al by threatening to turn him in for murder. As Vera, Ann Savage gives one of the greatest femme fatale performances ever. She's hard-blooded, ruthless, and (dare I say) savage. Suffice to say, Vera is not the kind of girl you'd bring home to mama. And I loved the fact that, contrary to almost every other picture of the day, the woman was the smartest character in the film. Years after I first saw Detour, Ann Savage's achievement is still fresh in my mind.While the production and camera-work leave a lot to be desired, Detour is one of the greatest examples of film noir ever. It features all the staples of the genre &#x96; dark shadowy sets, murky black & white lighting, a no-nonsense voice-over narration, and generally good characters pulled by outside forces into a web of deceit. Film noir protagonists often operated just outside the law, on the fringes of society. These weren't men who typically had a lot of friends. And when the protagonist was a cop, he was typically a plainclothes investigator who was at odds with the boys at headquarters. Think Glenn Ford in The Big Heat. These weren't the white hat heroes you'd find in the A movie, or main feature.Detour masterfully draws upon these tenets of the film noir style to present, through a highly personal story featuring very few characters, a world devoid of hope and promise. Now before you ask, Why on earth would I want to see this?, I must tell you that Detour is a lot of fun to watch. I suppose we know early on that things will not end well for Al, the lead character. But getting from the opening scene to the somewhat inevitable conclusion is a 68-minute thrill ride unlike almost any ever put on celluloid.Edgar G. Ulmer was a relatively unknown director. Detour is his claim to fame. And it's so good it makes me wonder what Ulmer could have done with a big studio budget. We'll never know, of course, but the Library of Congress was smart enough to tag Detour for preservation in the National Film Registry &#x96; meaning we'll always have access to this Buried Treasure.

Roddy Piper stars as a good-natured but not very bright construction worker, who pretty much spends his day chewing bubble-gum and kicking ass. He discovers a pair of sunglasses that give him the ability to separate normal humans from aliens that have taken over earth. In the fashion of every conspiracy theorist's dream, these aliens brainwash humans through subliminal advertising (which isn't too different today).

The fear of Zionism .It could be seen as the alleged Jewish infiltration of Western society. Or any elite sub-society that lives off the lower classes and are free from work, poverty or persecution. It's a pretty profound theme to be found in a film as intentionally offbeat and quirky as They Live. Its movies like this that make you feel (or want to fee, perhaps?) that the director is trying to telegraph you a secret that he knows of. In fact, it's pretty suspicious that this film, which was number one at Box Office for two weeks, disappeared from theatres straight after. I guess some nameless suits weren't too pleased at its release. Only, that's the beauty of independent filmmaking &#x96; you can make what you want without a studio pulling the strings. Best Scene It has to be the WWE style street brawl between the two leads, as Pipe tries again and again to make the ignorant David put on the glasses and open his eyes to the horror around him. A shout out to the hilarious sex ending though. ","genre":null},{"date":"24 August 2015","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Now this one's a real screamer.

","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"24 August 2015","score":"","review":" Spartacus is a historical epic that follows amongst the footsteps of prior historical epics such as Ben-Hur and the Ten Commandments. I have to admit this film is not nearly as great as those, but I am certainly not bashing this film. The fact is, the film is a tad overlong and the dialogue does not hold up well by today's standards. I can appreciate the fine performances, especially Ustinov's Oscar-winning performance, as well as the steady direction of a legend, Stanley Kubrick. The film has some great action sequences and as a history student, I can appreciate the historical aspect of this film. I also like, unlike other films of its time, where we are not stuffed the obligatory happy ending. Thus, that makes me appreciate this epic even more.Kubrick's film talks about a slave uprising during the Roman era. Spartacus is a slave who does not take pleasure at the fact he is being used to fight at a gladiator school only to receive spoiled girls. He and the rest of the slaves revolt which causes other slaves in the countryside to do the same. Crassus, who is aiming to become a dictator, decides to meet Spartacus and his men in battle.I really enjoyed the performances in this film. I liked Kirk Douglas's strength and perseverance as Spartacus. I liked the comedic timing in Peter Ustinov's performance as the head of the gladiatorial school, Batiatus. Jean Simmons gives a mighty fine performance as Spartacu's lover, Varinia. Finally, I really liked Laurence Olivier's deep, intense performance as Crassus, who wants nothing except for political power.Overall, Spartacus is a fine, entertaining historical spectacle. It features some majestic battle sequences and many fine, if perhaps a little outdated performances. The screenplay was excellent, as it was written by none other than the black-listed screenwriter, Dalton Trumbo. Compared to today's quality, the film doesn't live up to it. But I had a fun time watching this historical epic. Not Kubrick's best, but that doesn't stop it from being a fun watch.My Grade B+ ","genre":null},{"date":"24 August 2015","score":"","review":" Spartacus is a historical epic that follows amongst the footsteps of prior historical epics such as Ben-Hur and the Ten Commandments.
