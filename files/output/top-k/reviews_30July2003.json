[{"date":"30 July 2003","score":"","review":"  Bobby Bowfinger's film production company is in trouble. Then Afrim writes what appears to be a winning script about aliens who come to Earth in raindrops. (The title 'Chubby Rain'). All it needs is a major star such as action hero Kit Ramsey. When Ramsey says no, Bowfinger simply tells everyone Ramsey said he would do the film only under certain very strange conditions. He only tells cameraman Dave that Ramsey is to be filmed without his knowledge. The parts of the movie that don't involve Ramsey can be filmed separately. Bowfinger has a budget of only about $2000, so he goes out in the desert and hires a Spanish-speaking crew. He charges $25 for auditions, whether the person gets the part or not. An innocent girl from Ohio named Daisy succeeds in her audition, though she later turns out to be not so innocent. Ramsey is already paranoid and not nice at all. But when strange things start happening, he starts going over the edge. He already sees a psychiatrist at a place called MindHead, and treatment becomes even more urgent. Things get worse when Carol, one of Bowfinger's actresses, decides to have a conversation with Ramsey, thinking he knows.Meanwhile, a stand-in is needed for long shots and shots from the back, and the perfect person is found. Jiff has a dorky, gee-whiz quality about him, and all he needs is a haircut and contact lenses.The movie was funniest when Ramsey was being filmed without his knowledge. The scenes with Jiff were also great. During the second half, things got really wild. At one point, though, it appeared things were going to fall apart, but the movie redeemed itself by the end and things turned out great.Steve Martin was his usual self, which means good as always. But Eddie Murphy was very funny in his multiple roles. I don't recall him ever playing any characters like Jiff, though in 'The Klumps' his Buddy Love was a lot like Ramsey. Ramsey was so mean but also vulnerable, not in a touching way but always about to scream when things happened. Jiff, on the other hand, was Ramsey's total opposite--sweet, fun-loving, somewhat scared. Heather Graham made an appealing Daisy, though she did become manipulative as the movie progressed. I'm not sure what to say about Christine Baranski. She's usually so good, but her performance seemed cartoonish to me. If that was the intention, then she did her part well.This was great. It seemed to end all too quickly, though.     ","genre":null},{"date":"30 July 2003","score":"","review":"  Bobby Bowfinger's film production company is in trouble.
