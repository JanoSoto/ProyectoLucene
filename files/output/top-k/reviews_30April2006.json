I also respect the movie more than I did.I discovered new entertainment value when I recognized that the movie isn't even TRYING to be a good Batman film.

It's silly from beginning to end.It achieves exactly what it is trying to be, and for that it deserves credit. It's camptacular, with over-the-top special effects, costumes, and one-liners. Many people derided it for being a special-effects driven film, but I disagree. I think the special effects exist to drive the stupidity. The wilder the effects, the more unrealistic it all is, and the funnier it gets. It is a stupidity driven film.This is what the 60's TV show would have been with a massive budget. It understands that everything about Batman is silly, and it takes that to its logical end. The bad guys are even more out there than the first Batman movies, the dialogue wouldn't seem out of place at a beach party, and the Batmobile is just, well, you'll have to see.The cinematography is great, the set design is beautifully over the top, and the colors could keep a person high on meth occupied. The script is terrible, and there really isn't any plot, but that doesn't matter. It's not even part of the equation.They took everything campy about action movies and distilled it down to this. And for that, it deserves credit. Once I let go of what I expected from a Batman movie, and stopped judging it based on what I thought should be in the film, and just let me experience it as any other film I may come across, I really rather fell for it.I enjoyed this movie more than 'Batman Begins,' which is certainly a far better film by most measures, but is missing that je'ne se quas of a film that perfectly embodies what it's trying to be. 'Batman Begins' was patently absurd (a secret society of ninjas??), but it took itself gravely seriously. This movie is even more absurd, and it absolutely revels in it.

The two that followed are inconsequential but this sequel, Nerds in Paradise, just HAD to be done. Why??? They absolutely had to follow up the greatest college Fraternity movie (yes, better than Animal House) with the greatest Spring Break movie, especially since the 1980's was the decade that modern Spring Break as we know it hit its stride. The 80's are when students started to flock to Ft. Lauderdale and the rest of Florida, as well as to other havens across the nation such as Lake Havasu and the Gulf Coast\/Redneck Riviera.Anyway, these guys had to get to Florida and be a REAL Fraternity at some point. I like the angle of involving national fraternities, which brings in NEW Alpha Betas, and I love how the inter-fraternity hatred extends beyond the local schools to the national chapters.This movie also does a great job incorporating the oh so hot Beastie Boys style of rapping by introducing Barry Sobel's character, Stewart, a White Castle employee (in Florida, where there are NO White Castles - only Krystals) who happens to be a white rapper that sounds like he's right out of the Beastie Boys! I was a college Freshman in 1986, and I remember clearly the Beastie Boys being the hottest thing on campus that year. EVERYBODY liked them.I also love the beach\/vacation\/road trip quality this movie has. The first Revenge of the Nerds is a classic in its own right, no doubt. It did a great job establishing itself as a classic and really established the genre of wacky college frat movies. But what good is establishing the genre if you don't take it somewhere? Nerds in Paradise does exactly that. It profits off the foundation laid by the first movie. Many other movies also fed off these two movies (i.e. Fraternity Vacation, another Florida Spring Break movie with a nerdy hero, etc.).I love that the nerds are able to always use what they have to beat out the jocks and have their voices heard, and especially because this means having a musical performance with lasers and lights. Hilarious!!! This was also a good way to work in the Beastie Boys-esquire Barry Sobel Rap, which establishes him as one of the nerds although he's not part of the fraternity. It is the highest honor a non-fraternity member could get, next to being Lewis Skolnick's girlfriend I suppose, HEEEEEEPP!!!! I own a DVD that has Revenge of the Nerds on one side and RotN II on the other side - I think it was under 10 bucks on sale, and it was worth far more than that to me. I'd have paid 50 bucks for it, but I won't tell that to the DVD company. Weird to have a DVD that you actually Flip over and play the other side, though...My favorite line in the movie is from Roger, however OK. Maybe I did. What are you gonna do about it, Skolnick? You gonna make a little speech? It's not gonna do any good. Wanna know why? Because I'm strong and you're weak. Because I'm the type of guy that everybody here wants to be like, and you are pathetic. That's the way it is. That's the way it's always gonna be, and there's nothing you or your pencil-neck geek friends can do or say about it. Comprende, dickhead? Bradley Whitford was such an awesome Alpha Beta, and that's saying a lot considering he had to follow Ted McGinley (Stan Gables) who was awesome in the first movie. Roger was, throughout the movie, a PERFECT jock\/preppy snob, I really think Whitford did such a great job with this role that he might be the best actor in the whole movie!!! The line I quoted above just PERFECTLY sums up his and the entire Alpha Betas' attitudes, all into one, in-your-face, simplified, short summary. It starts with a brazen admission to framing the Tri-Lambs, goes into a diatribe against them based purely on bigoted, hateful perceptions, and caps everything off with a stupid sounding insult which no doubt Roger himself thought was cool and creative. Just PERFECT. Whitford's delivery of it was what made it work.One little problem I have with it has to do with Ogre's conversion to being a Nerd. The Nerds seem to always stress individualism and be proud of who\/what you are. Well, Ogre is a big strong guy - a jock. It is good that he sees the Nerds for the nice people they are, and the Alpha Betas for the jerks they are; but why should Ogre have to stop being a Jock to stop being an Alpha Beta??? Anyway, I am definitely analyzing this too much, because this film is about fun and having fun, and overblown clichés and stereotypes, and turning Ogre into a Nerd is just part of all that. I love his initiation Oh Lambda Truest, I am the newest, member of your clan. And in your..uh.. (the others help Ogre out by quietly cuing him - hallways) HALLways...I will always, be Proud of what I am. HEEEP!! HEEEEPPPP!!!! HEEEEEEEPPP!!! Funny how Ogre's laugh turns into a nerd laugh, magically, from reciting his oath to join the Tri-Lambs! But he's still Ogre, and drinks messily from the cup, like he did from the cup in the first movie. Anyway, this movie is HIGHLY recommended if you enjoy fun, light, gratuitous, cliché-ridden movies which are satires of themselves, just as the first one was. If you believe films ought to be serious, somber events which evoke deep thought, then don't bother, unless you're ready to live a little and relax a bit, then this movie is for you also.

The two that followed are inconsequential but this sequel, Nerds in Paradise, just HAD to be done. Why??? They absolutely had to follow up the greatest college Fraternity movie (yes, better than Animal House) with the greatest Spring Break movie, especially since the 1980's was the decade that modern Spring Break as we know it hit its stride. The 80's are when students started to flock to Ft. Lauderdale and the rest of Florida, as well as to other havens across the nation such as Lake Havasu and the Gulf Coast\/Redneck Riviera.Anyway, these guys had to get to Florida and be a REAL Fraternity at some point. I like the angle of involving national fraternities, which brings in NEW Alpha Betas, and I love how the inter-fraternity hatred extends beyond the local schools to the national chapters.This movie also does a great job incorporating the oh so hot Beastie Boys style of rapping by introducing Barry Sobel's character, Stewart, a White Castle employee (in Florida, where there are NO White Castles - only Krystals) who happens to be a white rapper that sounds like he's right out of the Beastie Boys! I was a college Freshman in 1986, and I remember clearly the Beastie Boys being the hottest thing on campus that year. EVERYBODY liked them.I also love the beach\/vacation\/road trip quality this movie has. The first Revenge of the Nerds is a classic in its own right, no doubt. It did a great job establishing itself as a classic and really established the genre of wacky college frat movies. But what good is establishing the genre if you don't take it somewhere? Nerds in Paradise does exactly that. It profits off the foundation laid by the first movie. Many other movies also fed off these two movies (i.e. Fraternity Vacation, another Florida Spring Break movie with a nerdy hero, etc.).I love that the nerds are able to always use what they have to beat out the jocks and have their voices heard, and especially because this means having a musical performance with lasers and lights. Hilarious!!! This was also a good way to work in the Beastie Boys-esquire Barry Sobel Rap, which establishes him as one of the nerds although he's not part of the fraternity. It is the highest honor a non-fraternity member could get, next to being Lewis Skolnick's girlfriend I suppose, HEEEEEEPP!!!! I own a DVD that has Revenge of the Nerds on one side and RotN II on the other side - I think it was under 10 bucks on sale, and it was worth far more than that to me. I'd have paid 50 bucks for it, but I won't tell that to the DVD company. Weird to have a DVD that you actually Flip over and play the other side, though...My favorite line in the movie is from Roger, however OK. Maybe I did. What are you gonna do about it, Skolnick? You gonna make a little speech? It's not gonna do any good. Wanna know why? Because I'm strong and you're weak. Because I'm the type of guy that everybody here wants to be like, and you are pathetic. That's the way it is. That's the way it's always gonna be, and there's nothing you or your pencil-neck geek friends can do or say about it. Comprende, dickhead? Bradley Whitford was such an awesome Alpha Beta, and that's saying a lot considering he had to follow Ted McGinley (Stan Gables) who was awesome in the first movie. Roger was, throughout the movie, a PERFECT jock\/preppy snob, I really think Whitford did such a great job with this role that he might be the best actor in the whole movie!!! The line I quoted above just PERFECTLY sums up his and the entire Alpha Betas' attitudes, all into one, in-your-face, simplified, short summary. It starts with a brazen admission to framing the Tri-Lambs, goes into a diatribe against them based purely on bigoted, hateful perceptions, and caps everything off with a stupid sounding insult which no doubt Roger himself thought was cool and creative. Just PERFECT. Whitford's delivery of it was what made it work.One little problem I have with it has to do with Ogre's conversion to being a Nerd. The Nerds seem to always stress individualism and be proud of who\/what you are. Well, Ogre is a big strong guy - a jock. It is good that he sees the Nerds for the nice people they are, and the Alpha Betas for the jerks they are; but why should Ogre have to stop being a Jock to stop being an Alpha Beta??? Anyway, I am definitely analyzing this too much, because this film is about fun and having fun, and overblown clichés and stereotypes, and turning Ogre into a Nerd is just part of all that. I love his initiation Oh Lambda Truest, I am the newest, member of your clan. And in your..uh.. (the others help Ogre out by quietly cuing him - hallways) HALLways...I will always, be Proud of what I am. HEEEP!! HEEEEPPPP!!!! HEEEEEEEPPP!!!

The last time I saw it was in a theatrical release in 1980 or 1981. I still remember singing Zippity Doo Dah as we were leaving the theater. All the criticisms I hear thrown at this film are absurd. I believe that most people offering up such criticism have not actually seen the film, but are merely parroting other reviewers.First things first. This film is not about slavery. There is no slavery depicted in SOTS. The action takes place on a plantation in Georgia AFTER the Civil War. No characters are mistreated, except for the Favers' brothers, who receive an off camera hiding for being cruel to their sister.The character Uncle Remus is a respected man in the community. Everyone looks up to him, including little Johnny's mother and grandmother. While the living conditions of the workers on the plantation might be considered poor, this was just indicative of the economic conditions of the time, and not a reflection of slave status.On to the movie itself. SOTS depicts a simple story of a small boy and his mother who come to live with their grandmother on a Georgia plantation. Bobby Driscoll is competent as Johnny. Compared to the majority of the juvenile cast, he did a fine job, and is simply adorable on screen. The mother, as played by Ruth Warrick, was the only weak spot to me, as she was just a bit too stiff, but still decent. Finally, James Baskett is delightful as Uncle Remus and carries the movie. He received a special Academy Award for his performance. Such a pity that he died so soon after the release of this film.The blending of animation of live action and animation was cutting edge back in 1946, and it goes over pretty well. Being a Disney film, suspending reality isn't hard to do. The musical numbers are great, and Zippety-Doo-Dah won an Oscar for Best Song.Rumor has it that there will be a DVD release of SOTS in 2006. I hope this is true, as this film deserves the full DVD treatment so a whole generation of kids, heck even adults, can enjoy this great movie. All of the political correct nonsense surrounding this film can be dispelled in the court of public opinion. Enjoy.

As a child growing up in rural Alabama, he suffers from polio and must wear leg braces, in addition to coping with ridicule from other school kids because of his diminished mental capacity. Forrest discovers that he can run like the wind, leading to a football scholarship and college diploma. Then he joins the military and serves in Vietnam, where he saves the life of his commander, Lieutenant Dan, but sees his best friend, Bubba, die in his arms. Later he becomes a ping pong champion, attending competition in Communist China. After being discharged from the army, Forrest sets up a shrimp boat company, Bubba Gump, as he & pal Bubba had planned, becoming a millionaire. Eventually he decides that he 'feels like running', so spends about three years crossing the country! Not a dull life for someone with an IQ of around 75.Interspersed with Forrest's personal tale are assorted historical people and events from the late 1950's to 1970's. Forrest just happens to find himself a central personage in various movements (KKK, Civil Rights, and war protest), exposes Watergate, and inadvertently invents the Smiley Face. He meets Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon (who bestow his Medal of Honour and such), teaches Elvis to dance, and inspires John Lennon's song Imagine..all the while blissfully unaware. Of course it's all nonsense (great special effects!), but these exaggerated absurdities point out how the Forrests of this world do contribute to society and that unsung heroes may lie behind famous celebrities.Throughout his life, Forrest loves a girl named Jenny, who befriends him during childhood and defends him against his taunting schoolmates. For years they are childhood playmates 'like peas & carrots', and Forrest imparts a feeling of safe refuge to Jenny, who has her own trials dealing with her father's sexual abuse. Forrest's ongoing love for Jenny is a constantly touching theme, even as she experiences a turbulent young adulthood filled with sex and drugs, becomes a stripper and later hippie, is involved with the Black Panters, and eventually suicidal. Forrest does everything for Jenny and always seeks to protect her, although for years she rejects his love and instead prefers abusive men, a result of her childhood experiences. The story's end is beautiful but heart wrenching. Forrest & Jenny's lovemaking produces a little son, who remains unknown to his dad throughout his early years. By now Jenny has come to grips with her personal demons, welcomes Forrest's unconditional love, and finally agrees to marriage. Alas, she has also been diagnosed with a terminal illness (possibly AIDS). Forrest & Jenny have a lovely wedding, but shortly thereafter she dies and leaves their son, little Forrest, in the care of his father. The scene where Jenny tells Forrest about his son is surely the film's most moving, as Forrest is flabbergasted with joy that he's the father of this beautiful boy but is also tearfully concerned as to whether he's smart or like his dad. Jenny assures him that little Forrest is a very intelligent child. Only the coldest heart would remain unmoved by this scene, the later one at Jenny's grave, or any of those showing little Forrest with his doting dad.The character of Lieutenant Dan is masterfully done, as initially Gump's Commanding Officer resents Forrest for having saved his life, forcing his adjustment to living without his legs. Later Lieutanant Dan joins Forrest's shrimp boat operation and the pair become friends. It is probably thanks to Forrest that Dan comes to peace with God, following his Vietnam experiences. Forrest's 'best good friend', Bubba, is also well captured, a rather slow underdog type who's shrimp obsessed.Tom Hanks gives a brilliant Oscar winning portrayal of the rather slow witted but pure hearted Forrest. Sally Field is also wonderful as his practical and doting mother, who convinces Forrest that he can make whatever he wants of his life and shouldn't feel inferior to anyone. Early in the film, Mrs. Gump ensures her son's enrollment in a regular school by sleeping with the principal!From an early age, Mrs. Gump informs her son that 'Stupid is as stupid does'...the film's ongoing theme. Forrest is aware of his limited intelligence but deals cheerfully and matter of factly with it, experiencing no resentment over his situation or bitterness toward those who put him down. He is the very model of innocence, the essence of the pure in heart. Unlike the intelligent folk in the movie, Forrest does NOT behave stupidly, but with kindness, generosity, loyalty, and honour, always keeping his promises. It's a film that definitely makes the viewer question...exactly who are the stupid ones in this story? Certainly Jenny, with her unwise lifestyle choices. But frankly, in all the ways that count, NOT Forrest. Only in the scene where Forrest so touchingly questions Jenny about his son's intelligence do we grasp how much Forrest has suffered, wanting his son spared any ridicule for being slow but instead able to lead a 'normal' life with all the best opportunities.This is a beautiful story, with surely one of the most endearing heroes in cinematic history. Hopefully, it will inspire everyone to treat those having mental limitations with the dignity and respect they deserve. The picture of young Forrest running to escape pursuit by those bicycling bullies is a vivid reminder of the cruel taunts the mentally challenged sometimes suffer even in this supposedly enlightened era. Forrest understands everything truly important in life...family, friendship, love, country, and faith in God. It is a tale of great morality and great simplicity.

I managed to rationalize the horror of other films -- after Jaws I reasoned that sharks could endanger people only if they enter the water and only at certain ocean beaches; and after Saving Private Ryan I decided that WWII ended long ago and that the armed forces didn't recruit people my age anyway -- but I couldn't think myself through the depression I experienced for 2-3 days following the night I watched Deliverance.The poverty of the people living above the Cahulawassee River, the hostility of some of them towards outsiders, their overall social and emotional limitations, as underscored by the banjo playing boy's autistic-like detachment as he looked down at the canoeists from a foot bridge, had me unnerved before the real adventure began. Looking back, I not only owed my fear to a well written story, but also to a wisely chosen and ably directed cast.Burt Reynolds did a very believable job in his portrayal of Lewis Medlock, the lone physical, backwoods smart, outdoors man of the foursome.

He's reached a midway point in some ugly midlife crisis as this story begins and by the half-hour mark, he's gone beyond the point of no return. Who can identify with him? - try about 20 million middle class American males. Douglas creates an interesting and compelling character here. He's not completely crazy nor is he entirely oblivious to his surroundings in his obsessed determination to reach 'home.' What he is, though, is very angry, just boiling mad - probably because he held it all in for his entire adult life up to this point. So when he runs across the various inane qualities that make up big city modern life - rude shopkeepers, local gang members, vapid fast food rules - well, this takes its cue from the film Network - he's mad as hell and not gonna take it anymore. It's a bit on the simplistic side but we soon realize it's not meant to be a fully realistic slice of life.

His scenes with the other cops and, over the phone, with his tiring wife, lack the intensity of Douglas being on the move and, after a couple of minutes of such easygoing charm, we want to get back to Douglas on the prowl.

Seeing that the average rating on this one at the IMDb is 6.6 at time of writing lends much credence to the oft-held postulate that the planet is increasingly populated by morons.Warrior god Xenu drops nuclear bombs in the volcanoes of the planet Earth only 75 million years ago in an attempt to cure his own civilisation of a slight issue with overpopulation - something on the order of a trillion gajillion zillion of them. This all makes perfect sense. And your mission, Tom, should you choose to accept it, is to go on screen in this shameless waste of a viable premise and make more of an ass out of yourself than even you had been capable of before.You've done everything you could to get an Oscar short of administering group oral sex to the entire AMPAS, so you maybe better concentrate on the green stuff instead - and face the fact your esteemed colleagues just don't like you.Watching Cruise go through the motions of being an action hero is pathetic - and then suddenly it dawns on you this idiot is so crazy he really believes he's an action hero. He gets to be all the things he isn't in real life. This twit is long gone.In fact, thinking about this - inadvertently thinking about this, it's impossible to avoid, what with all we know today about what a looney tune Cruise is - makes it impossible to take this sorry excuse for a movie seriously.The original small screen formula is easy to research it's listed here on the IMDb. Perhaps some of the IMDb's bumpkin reviewers would do themselves a service by reading up on it (if in fact they can read - this is open to debate, as we all know, as there is ample evidence they can neither type nor spell).The only light in this movie (aside from the visual delight of Emmanuelle Beart) is Henry Czerny who gets kudos for again (as in Clear and Present Danger) getting the style of the slimy crook down pat. How Czerny does this I do not know they don't scrape his face as with Le Chiffre - he's always given a robot look and still he can come off as totally threatening. If fact I might even be a bit wary of this bloke if I met him on the street - that's how well I think he does his part.As for the rest of the movie, it's everything the critics said it was - and worse. Far far worse. It appeals only to people with an IQ below zero. Only to people whose brain cells work like amoebas and where Mother Nature is still waiting for that first cataclysmic split. There is no story - none; they dash the premise of the original to smithereens within minutes (leaving one to wonder why they wanted to grab the franchise in the first place) and the plot thereafter makes absolutely no sense at all. Worse, the special effects are horrendous. Cartoons do it better and are more realistic.This is the movie, box office success or no, that finally convinced the world Tom Cruise is nuts. Totally nuts. That he chooses to go out into the world and promote his latest cash cow MI3 while his 'wife' is at home going through labour with her test tube baby is only more evidence that Hollywood have an incredibly unique and totally hopeless loser on their hands.Good night Mr Phelps.

From the opening shots I was stunned by the lack of pro lighting and camera. I have shot better looking student film. There was even a scene where KKson was searching under the bed for his boot and the lighting appeared as though the sun were shinning from under the bed. KKson later while visiting the favored brothel came in with guns blazing just in time to save his favorite prostitute from being gang raped and killed. Enter Chris Walkin who just happened to be passing by as well. The hired gun became so outraged that he changed sides. Believe me I wanted to stop watching, however the underlying story had my interest. About the story; my opinion so what, has anyone told the story of the Trail of Tears. Far more people died at the hands of our government and their citizens. They were only Indian's so I guess it does not count. Should you see this film. Absolutely, especially if you are an aspiring filmmaker and want to see how not to make a movie. You can see what it is like to have a scene done over and over and how it can threaten a film. My favorite was the ending, you should see how well an 18th century prostitute can ride, shoot, and suck at realism. By the way while you are cutting the redundant from this piece of unedited tripe; let us stick to one ending, I counted the film ended three times. So go forth you soldiers of great story telling, rent this film in the morning and you will be finished with it's how not to make a film presentation by the time you are ready for bed that evening. Reason being, not only is it about one hour to long, but there is room to make such cuts. As is you will nap and need to start over several times.WFD ","genre":null},{"date":"30 April 2006","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I have never seen a worse film.

It may be that I missed something or that Iam a philistine but to me it felt stilted and dated.

If you sit back and enjoy the movie and pay attention to all the clues, you'll see the story works out pretty well. The only rough part of the movie is that some of the scenes with Diesel 10 were scary to my two year old son. Yet these scenes help to create the tension needed to propel the story.
