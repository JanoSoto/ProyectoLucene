Admittedly for every Stone Roses (best band ever, by the way) there were about a dozen rip-offs &#150; some of them actually worse than The Farm), so it was kind of a given that I'd dig Twenty Four Hour Party People. But although I was predisposed towards liking it, it really is an excellent film. It's a movie about the insanity of the music industry but there's no sermonising, no moralising and no preaching. Even though liberties are taken with the truth &#150; the film admits this, quoting the famous John Ford adage 'When you have to chose between the truth and the legend; print the legend' &#150; it feels authentic.One of the most successful scenes is the one dealing with Ian Curtis' suicide. Ordinarily there'd be the temptation to try and fill it with meaning and emotion, but instead it comes across as it probably was &#150; a rather sad, meaningless act. And the funeral avoids sentimentality, too. There's an amusing moment when a Joy Division fan tries to convince Tony Wilson that he can take Ian's part. He even says he can do the dance! But there's a nice moment when Tony touches Ian's hand as he's lying in the coffin and when he kisses his forehead. Those small actions express the depth of feeling perfectly.But although that moment is entirely serious, the majority of the film is comic. And if you watch the DVD extras Peter Hook even complains about this. He says something about this being their lives. Well, fair enough it may be somewhat annoying for a person involved in the scene to not have their work treated with solemn respect, but how seriously can you take Madchester? I mean, I love it to bits, but this is the music scene that gave us Shaun Ryder and Bez, The Inspiral Carpets and Tony Wilson. Comedy was the only way to go.One of the things I like the most is the sheer incompetence of Factory. They made great music and they had tons of style, but as a business they were bottom of the league. Just take the way the gig posters arrive during the gig It took ages to get the right yellow. Or the way the tickets for the first night of the Hacienda arrive only a few hours before the event. Or the way they lose money on each copy of 'Blue Monday' &#150; which became the biggest selling 12-inch single. And then there's the bit where we're informed that the Factory offices have a zinc roof, but you can only see it from a helicopter. It's insane. But then again, this is what makes Factory so endearing. They were completely guileless.But you really do have to wonder about the intelligence of Tony Wilson. Yeah he may have gone to Cambridge and yes he may be able to wax lyrical at the drop of a hat, but the whole communal approach to music making was doomed from the outset. You've only got to remind yourself of the mentality of the average rock star to realise this.The Happy Mondays best illustrate the fact that Wilson's experiment was to doomed to failure. A bunch of working class lads who take copious amounts of drugs, they were never going to be particularly productive. But although Wilson was mad to indulge them so excessively, it really is rather endearing that he did. The music industry is one of the most cynical industries there is, so it's nice that, for a brief time, a relative innocent was able to make an impact.But back to the Mondays. I love the scene at the airport where they smash all of Ryder's methadone before they even get on the plane. They're a bunch of fools. They're a shambles. But once again I love the fact that this happened. Who wants a band to be measured and sober? You want them to live the crazy life you're not brave enough to live yourself. And then there's the bit where Ryder steals the master tapes and tries to sell them back to Factory. He even uses a gun during negotiations. These are the sorts of things I want to happen in the music industry. I wish they were happening all the time.And Bez! Honestly, could any film that has a cinematic representation of Bez possibly fail? I don't think so, and especially when the Bez here is such a brilliant copy. The kid has the spaced-out expression and monkey moves down perfectly. Oh, and he even arrives via UFO. Brilliant! It's also a joy seeing Steve Coogan's version of Tony Wilson. Really, is there any one quite so pretentious, quite so bombastic and quite so up himself as Anthony Wilson? Probably not. And the recreations of local news segments are priceless. The hand gliding is the most famous one, but I personally love the dwarf hosing the elephant. Pick on someone your own size, or maybe not. Anyone who lives in Britain and has watched their local news will know the horror of the 'comic' news segment.But Coogan does get funnier moments. Best of all is when his wife catches him getting a blow-job from a hooker. I love you! (Can you finish me off?) And then in the next scene I only got a blow-job. That's full penetration. But that part of the film reminds me of Peter Kay. He steals every scene he's in. And I love his line when he's taking Wilson to the prostitutes Let's have a nosh to seal the bag. Peter Kay, I salute you.But there's so much great stuff in the film the music, the Hacienda, the stuff dealing with the gun problems, the old concert footage, the scene with the pigeons.

Co-star George Kennedy got the Oscar and Strother Martin delivered its most famous line, but this is a Newman film through and through, maybe his best one, and along with Lawrence Of Arabia maybe the most perfect movie of the 1960s.Newman plays Lucas Jackson, a decorated war veteran who has a hard time adjusting once back at home. After he is arrested for cutting the heads off a row of parking meters, perhaps inspired by Bob Dylan, he is sent to a prison work camp for two years to get your mind right, as the prison's Captain (Strother Martin) puts it. Only Luke has different ideas, after living his life the way the Man wanted only to be rewarded with violence, guilt and heartbreak.Luke has come through this crucible with breezy bravado and an indomitable spirit that gives the film much of its power. When he faces another inmate named Dragline (George Kennedy) in a boxing match, Luke quickly gets the tar beaten out of him so bad the other inmates lose their appetite for carnage and tell Luke to just stay down so Dragline will win. Luke won't quit, though You're gonna have to kill me, he grunts.Let him draw some blood, maybe the guards will break it up, says one of the smarter inmates, a check-kiter named Society Red (J.D. Cannon).I wouldn't want to frighten him, Luke grunts back.The film actually works as something of a comedy for the first half, with Newman's lovable-loser persona on a par with his role in Slapshot years later. We sense a deeper pain, but Newman brilliantly keeps us at bay with his killer grin. Then as the film develops, Luke's uniquely unbending character and his popularity among the other inmates (You're a genuine original, Dragline notes) make him a target of the camp bosses, especially after Luke addresses the chief screw, Boss Godfrey a.k.a. No Eyes, with less than the requisite amount of humility after No Eyes shoots a snake Luke is holding. Luke winds up locked in a box, a ridiculously excessive punishment made worse still when the Captain announces it's being done because Luke's mother just died and they want to keep him from getting ideas about paying his respects. The only worse thing one can do than incarcerate a man wrongly is proclaim it is being done for his own good.

Co-star George Kennedy got the Oscar and Strother Martin delivered its most famous line, but this is a Newman film through and through, maybe his best one, and along with Lawrence Of Arabia maybe the most perfect movie of the 1960s.Newman plays Lucas Jackson, a decorated war veteran who has a hard time adjusting once back at home. After he is arrested for cutting the heads off a row of parking meters, perhaps inspired by Bob Dylan, he is sent to a prison work camp for two years to get your mind right, as the prison's Captain (Strother Martin) puts it. Only Luke has different ideas, after living his life the way the Man wanted only to be rewarded with violence, guilt and heartbreak.Luke has come through this crucible with breezy bravado and an indomitable spirit that gives the film much of its power. When he faces another inmate named Dragline (George Kennedy) in a boxing match, Luke quickly gets the tar beaten out of him so bad the other inmates lose their appetite for carnage and tell Luke to just stay down so Dragline will win. Luke won't quit, though You're gonna have to kill me, he grunts.Let him draw some blood, maybe the guards will break it up, says one of the smarter inmates, a check-kiter named Society Red (J.D. Cannon).I wouldn't want to frighten him, Luke grunts back.The film actually works as something of a comedy for the first half, with Newman's lovable-loser persona on a par with his role in Slapshot years later. We sense a deeper pain, but Newman brilliantly keeps us at bay with his killer grin. Then as the film develops, Luke's uniquely unbending character and his popularity among the other inmates (You're a genuine original, Dragline notes) make him a target of the camp bosses, especially after Luke addresses the chief screw, Boss Godfrey a.k.a. No Eyes, with less than the requisite amount of humility after No Eyes shoots a snake Luke is holding.

While she's leaning over a boat railing trying to get an earring, Owen stands behind her and creeps up...Soon the police are looking for Larry to question him, but he's at Owen's where he's being encouraged to live up to his end of a bargain he had no idea he made. You know, criss-cross. There are several scenes copied from Strangers, which are hilarious. I especially loved Larry's confession to the sleeping Mrs. Lift, Owen's mother, similar to when Guy thinks he's talking to Bruno's stepfather.Crystal and DeVito are complete masters of comic dialogue and timing and will leave you laughing, often out loud.

What Faces offers just on its own as a character based drama is almost enough to see what the director is all about. No big budget, no fake sets, just people on the screen who have real personalities and histories with each other, and conflicts that are given enough light to get an idea of what they're about. But what is given, shot in a grainy 16mm feel by Cassavetes, using mostly theater actors (and Cassavetes's wonderful wife Gena Rowlands), are compelling enough to stay with them, through their flaws and difficulties with one another, and through this we get a look into their small world. Film-making like this is rare, where the director- also as writer- can work with so little to provide so much emotionally for a viewer. It's definitely a certain kind of world shown, of New Yorkers with relationship crises and psychological complexes that may go a bit beyond some viewer's expectations. That how they communicate is so raw is also a little unnerving at times, and some scenes deserve to be seen twice to grasp everything that's going on.But Faces, for all its moments of improvisation, is a work that is alive, because it has characters who question their own excesses and escapes while not being able to really escape them. There's adultery, alcohol, an overdose, and lots of talking at times. But there's also moments of true compassion, and reality that likely could be found in few exceptions of films at the time it was made (especially about the middle class). And at times what the filmmaker gets us to feel for these completely imperfect and almost damaged people (underneath their middle class side) is a bit shattering. Take the scenes involving Seymour Cassel and the woman he's found in the morning unable to really wake up. This whole set of events as he tries to wake her up is a true knockout kind of cinema, where there's no pretense between what is being shown on the screen and what the audience is receiving. Arguably, there are at times scenes that feel nearly too theater-based, as if we might as well see this on an off-Broadway production.But in this kind of independent film, where there really aren't limits, Cassavetes is interested in characters and situations that Hollywood would just take as stereotypes or more conventional forms. And with the professionals like John Marley, Rowlands, Cassel, and especially Lynn Carlin (who along with Cassel got richly deserved Oscar nominations), Cassavetes at times just lets his script go with them and the conviction they bring is, at times, shocking. This is the sort of film that influenced Scorsese, though his style has also influenced a good chunk of what are American independent films, where the limits of budget, time, and Hollywood perks like staged sets and special effects, can sometimes be used for an advantage with a good enough script and cast. To put it mildly, I can't wait to see this film again.

In the event, 84 Charing Cross Road really was, and is, a triumph of the film-makers and the actors art. No violence, no explicit sex scenes, no computer-generated scenes, nothing but the interaction of actors playing ordinary, everyday human-beings but the result is gripping and uplifting. 84 Charing Cross Road, brilliant though it was, was not the acme of Anthony Hopkins screen performance in the 80s, a couple of years later he went on to make Alan Ayckroyd's A Chorous of Disapproval a movie which was supposed to star Jeremy Irons in the lead role. Although Iron's performance is beyond reproach, Hopkins stole the movie with his performance as the stereotypical amateur dramatics producer Dafydd Ap Llewellyn - another tour-de-force for Hopkins and a movie which can be watched time and time again.

Matthew Lillard sucks in this film and Shannon Elizabeth, well thank god you have good looks!

Pointless accurately describes this movie, even knowing that a horrors\/thrillers are not known because of their character development or inappropriately elaborate plot lines. The main problem is that the Chainsaw Massacre does not really have a plot, save the intro, up to the point we can see the first killing.I must admit that I have not yet seen the first movie, or any of its predecessors, but after seeing this, I started to become curious how they could be. I know that sequels are not superior to its prequels, at least in the eyes of the reviewers. Seeing that the first movie got far better rating than this one, I look forward to seeing them, or any.As for this film, I do not intend to give a brief outline of the plot, as some of my fellow reviewers have done so. The story started out relatively well, mainly because of the dialog in the car, but it continuously became worse as the movie progressed. When the fat man with started chasing the poor girl with the chainsaw, I was hoping that at least there would be something that boosts my morale in this movie. But no, not a single one was killed in a downright bloody and brutal way, I exaggerate if I say that either of the killings was any good. Yes, either, because only two of the four protagonists die in the movie, plus one antagonist gets chopped by the propeller of an aircraft. That was the best part in the film. (How the aircraft came into the view and why remains a mystery) Frankly, I was expecting more from this movie. I expected much gore and got little. The skulls, skeletons, and other corpses improve a bit on the overview. Not if these were elements which are unique for a narrow range of horror movies, or how they are displayed\/placed were any special.

This movie will have you falling asleep in a matter of minutes. Christopher lee is IMO one of the worst villains as he seems more like an insane little boy than a villain. Roger Moore as usual dishes out stupid one-liners while exchanging them with one of the worst Bond girls ever. Mary Goodnight has got to be the dumbest Bond girl to date and she does nothing but drag out the movie when she is captured. This movie also has THE worst henchman EVER in a Bond film. Knick-Knack was a horrible henchman and I would grunt every time he showed up on screen. He tries to add comedy to this movie but the comedy bombs. This movie gives a lame villain, a dumb bond girl, and a useless henchman and I still give this movie a 5. The plot was very boring but I like the concept. If they had followed through on it this movie would have been great. The car chase was not only comedic but it was very cool as this showed some car stunts never seen before in a Bond movie. The ending scene was clever even though I hated the concept of a Fun House for a villain. Nothing is spectacular in this film except the great plot idea and the car chase and stunts. This is one of those movies that could have been great if given the right actors and a thicker plot. This movie is just screaming out for Sean Connery as I feel he could have made this work. I do wish Connery did this movie as I feel it would have been better. Overall this is just a reason why Roger Moore is the worst Bond ever.
