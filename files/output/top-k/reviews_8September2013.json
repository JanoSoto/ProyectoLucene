It contains certain conventions of his film craft, yet introduces a unique twist--a twist that is misunderstood.As is always the case in a Hitchcock film, blood is the element of murder. Here, the blood stain on a dress is what links the characters together. Like a deadly game of tag, the dress goes from person to person, pulling them into the story, tainting them. First, the framed boyfriend, then the girl who loves him, then her father.Hitchcock likes to play with the difference between what the characters know and what the viewers know. When the audience knows more, it can add suspense (e.g. when Raymond Burr sees Grace Kelly point to the ring in Rear Window). Here he toys with us, giving us a flashback that misleads, but it is not really a false flashback as it has so often been called. Remember that this is not a case of the director showing what happened prior; it is an illustration of the story being told to Jane Wyman by Richard Todd. He is manipulating her with a false story. So the misunderstanding is caused by a false telling, not a false flashback. But, yes, Hitchcock does use it to mislead us. He is challenging the rules (but in a fair way) just as he fooled everyone by killing off the star of his movie Psycho.Personally, I enjoyed all the acting, especially Alastair Sims as Jane Wyman's father. I found the dialogue of this movie very enjoyable--clever and full of nuance and illusion. Sims really took advantage of his role and delivered some delicious lines.It was nice to Patricia Hitchcock in the minor role of Chubby. In Strangers on a Train, she gets to better display her talents.Wyman's character, an acting student, takes on the various roles as the lies pile up. Eventually, she becomes the assistant\/dresser for the star actress played by Marlene Dietrich. Her father becomes her assistant\/dresser in that role, as she is drawn deeper and deeper into her own fiction.At the beginning of the film, we see the curtain rise on the proceedings (something Baz Luhrmann used later). Until the final curtain falls, we are drawn into a suspenseful story of an amateur sleuth. Time is an important element in suspense, and Hitchcock does not need to put a clock on screen to remind us of the impending problems that threaten his characters here. And he sometimes seems to drag out the time with inconsequentials, knowing he is drawing us further into the anxiety of his protagonists.I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I hope others discover it.

This masterpiece was not about Holocaust and its atrocities but rather this theme served as allegory for something so sadly rare that in order to show it the director had to use this controversial subject in a comedy. I am talking about something called human spirit although I don't like this phrase as it became slowly a cliché. I am Polish and had a few relatives who experienced concentration camps - some of them survived - one didn't. I also lived 100 km from Auschwitz which became sort of a destination for school field trips. On top of that - in schools we had an extensive course on camp literature and let me tell you that your typical Holocaust movie is not especially realistic either. The problem I have with those movies is that it shows always similar narrative diabolical German guards (chosen from criminals), victims so sick and emaciated, and super obedient due to hunger, illness and extreme fear that you could not find the shred of humanity in them. Other people, outsiders, did not nothing because conveniently didn't know. Camps were super isolated so only a few could be blamed - that is typical narrative of movies which makes people feel good. After all we are not so bad, it is just a few of us. As to camps image of prisoners are totally inhuman which is probably the biggest injustice to those who suffered and died. But death, torture,hunger was just part of the camp experience, huge no doubt but not the whole truth about those places. There was camaraderie, help, compassion,medical attention done by prisoners doctors (some hanged for this),acts of incredible courage (Jan Karski, priest Kolbe)... And if you want to know how it really was like being there read Tadeusz Borowski's This way to the gas, Ladies and Gentelmen or Men's search for meaning by Victor Frankl.

What I am trying to say that clichéd, tired image of big cruel guards, sheep like prisoners walking in mud,slowly,in perfect order towards death without any protest, piles of corpses really say nothing about Holocaust.

Right, JAMAICA INN is Hitchock's last European production before he left for Hollywood but if you are well acknowledged of the director's legacy and expect to see it as another Hitchcock, you may end up at a sort of 'Hitchwreck.' It echoes Expressionism, it echoes Gothic atmosphere of Ufa Studio films, it echoes these specific literary sources like LES MISERABLES, of course, but it does not echo any of Hitchcock's popular films (perhaps, being a prelude to REBECCA, his first Hollywood production and a film adaptation of the same author).Quite soon after the release of JAMAICA INN, the New York Times reviewer, Frank S Nugent, accurately pointed out that the film is a merely journeyman melodrama...which will not be remembered as a Hitchcock picture, but as a Charles Laughton picture. Indeed, the actor is at the center of attention though he does not play the protagonist. At the same time, the movie's superb direction, excellent casting, expressive playing and fine production offset owes a lot to the style couched in pure silent German Gothic (Fernando F Croce). Consider the opening shot, the locale of the setting, the images of the sun and the moon, the feast at Sir Humphrey's, the dark, gloomy moments near the finale and the detailed touches of mystique and glamor. However, as it appears not that right to reveal the atmosphere of certain scenes, let me highlight the most significant aspect(according to Nugent's viewpoint) - CHARLES LAUGHTON.Undeniably one of the very best actors of the old English tradition with superb elements of wit and drama, of sarcasm and devotion, I could agree with many of the praise that hailed his performance. Sometimes, being likened to his role in the aforementioned LES MISERABLES (the roles which indeed carry certain significant similarity), he portrays a two-faced villain who HAS A LAW. Sometimes, his mimics strikingly evoke the Mephisto of Murnau's FAUST. With a few liberties taken (considering the literary source), Laughton manages to add the incredible emotional resonance to the entire depiction of a decadent, corrupted man - calm, discreet, patient and deceptive. Finally, however, he is able to grasp the ambiguous combination of self pity and insanity. Depraved though insane mind to portray on the screen must have been a tremendous challenge for an actor whose performance is best described by Dennis Schwartz as hammy eye-rolling and eye-catching. This very well counted and powerfully handled makes for (perhaps) the only merit of JAMAICA INN for today's viewing. Really a towering performance!As far as other performances are concerned, a note must be made of ravishing and sensual (at moments) Maureen O'Hara, practically a newcomer at the time. She has beauty, no doubt, but also brains to avoid certain clues towards sheer melancholy and naiveness that evokes from her role, from the roles of many women of the time. As a result, her performance, fortunately, lacks the laughable clichés and saccharine sentimentality (which may be good in other films but which would, naturally, spoil a lot in a motion picture like this one). But, after longer inspection, she does not stand out. As her co-star comes .....whose performance goes flat very quickly. If there is anyone more worth attention, this is, probably, Mary Nay as Patience, not for the virtues of acting that much as the virtues of the character portrayed.Naturally, there are typical overtones of the cinema of the time like evil punished in quite a predictable manner, some lengthy sequences, certain flaws in the dialogs. But...all in all, JAMAICA INN is a movie worth seeking out for its heavy influence of gloomy German Expressionism (who like the atmospheric Gothic touches, of course) and unforgettable Charles Laughton. 7\/10 for the entire film.

When it became a hit a film adaptation was practically inevitable. Carrie is considered one of the most important horror films of the 70s.Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is an isolated high school student with no friends and a fundamentalist Christian mum, Margaret (Piper Laurie). After being humiliated when she gets her first period in the school shower her telekinetic powers start to develop and heighten when under stress. Sue Snell (Amy Irving) feels guilty due to the incident in the shower where she joined in with mob and wants to make it up to Carrie by getting her boyfriend, Tommy (William Katt) to take Carrie to the prom. But the lead bully, Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen) wants revenge against Carrie, blaming her for not letting her go to the prom and with her delinquent boyfriend, Billy (John Travolta) plan to humiliate Carrie in the most public and sadistic way possible.Carrie is an excellent novel, a short, taut little affair that is a breeze of a read. Some of the elements from the novel would have been hard to translate into because of the structure of the novel mainly the extracts from the White Commission, The Shadow Exploded and Sue Snell's diary. Other scenes were cut because of expense, i.e. the explosion of the petrol station. But this is an adaptation that does make some big changes and cuts from the novel. Some include not getting to see Chris' father threatening to sue and ends up seeing what his daughter really is, cutting out Sue's pregnancy to small things like Carrie saying her father left her mother instead of dying in an industrial accident. Plus the sociological elements were cut out, looking at the impact of the aftermath of the Carrie incident which I thought was some of the most interesting stuff in the novel.The big positive with the film is the casting of Spacek she was a terrific as Carrie, having the right look for seemingly being a little weird but have a unique beauty when she is at the prom. She was able to convey the shy, awkwardness of a character who is beaten emotionally at home and at school and shows a psychopathic rage with the look with her eyes when the pigs blood fell on her. The rest of the cast were solid, like Allen playing the bitchy, self-centred bully, Travolta as the abusive boyfriend, Katt and Irving as the high school students who want to do the right thing. Betty Buckley was excellent as the friendly teacher who wants to support and protect Carrie and Laurie did a good job as Carrie's fundamentalist mother. But Sydney Lassick was really hammy and out of place as an English teacher who wasn't even in the book.The big highlight of the film was the prom scene when the pig's blood felt on Carrie goes into a psychopathic rage, locking the doors with her mind and sets out killing everyone. Director Brian De Palma was able highlight the build-up and the tension and then the terror of Carrie's killing. De Palma was able to make the sequence with a unique style using split screens to show different actions happening at the same time and De Palma used silences, making us lip-read what people are saying (though it is very obvious). It is excellent sequence.During the film they are plenty of musical cues when Carrie using her powers, partly due to the limits of special effects, but sometimes the violin streaks from Psycho which was a distraction.Carrie is a very well-acted film that had some stand out sequences and excellent acting, but it is too loose of an adaptation for me.

For all the criticism of Ben Affleck as an actor this film seemed to accommodate his style and he pulled of an impressive performance. The complex relationship between his and Joey Lauren Adams character's is thought provoking and asks real questions. Somewhat of a rarity in film nowadays. Credit should be given to the supporting actors as they add to the emotional nuances that the script provided and most importantly portrayed realistic people with actual problems and life struggles. I like Kevin Smith and enjoy his take on film and hope that he continues to ask real questions and most importantly continue making films driven by his own passion. If I were to find any flaw in this premise it will have to be in that Joey Lauren Adams's Character refers to herself as a lesbian but she clearly has had intimate relationships with men, this might attributed to confusion within her own sexuality or that for that period in time she is only dating women but even if that is the case that would still make her bisexual. Perhaps this is just a commentary on how some men view lesbianism as the dialogue in the film does actually address this. Thought Provoking.

Just go watch the movie. Now.What more can be said? Vamp is totally 80s to the max. Let's begin with the actors... We've got Chris Makepeace (Meatballs, My Bodyguard) sporting tight jeans and a oh-so-fashionable blue football jacket. We've got Robert Rusler (Weird Science, The Facts of Life) sporting a lovely pastel shirt and wool blazer with the sleeves rolled up to the elbows. Then we've got Gedde Watanabe (Long Duk Dong in 16 Candles) reprising his classic nerdy role, only this time without the horribly contrived Asian accent so you can safely laugh at him without feeling racist. And of course we've got Grace Jones, 80s icon extraordinaire (Conan the Destroyer, A View to a Kill) sporting a wire bikini that makes Princess Leia's brass swimsuit look like a nun's habit.But for my money, the actor who steals the show is the late, great Sandy Baron as Vic the seedy nightclub owner. You've definitely seen his mug all over TV in minor roles that always stole the show (on Seinfeld he was the cranky retiree who gave Jerry the astronaut pen). He definitely steals the show in Vamp as the lovably sinister old timer who just wants to get to Vegas, even if it means selling his soul to a clan of bloodthirsty vampires. Sandy even has a few dramatic monologues which add depth to this otherwise silly romp. When he proselytizes about his service of ridding society of the dregs, the wanderers and the losers, and he punctuates it with a toothy Cheshire-cat grin, it sends a chill right up your spine.Plot-wise, it's your basic creatures-of-the-night-run-amok-in-a-bar story. You know, the one Tarantino recycled in From Dusk Til Dawn 10 years later. Yes, Vamp was the original and don't you forget it.There's some great comedy in this movie, and for that reason it's hard to approach it as a horror film. The whole thing is tongue-in-cheek which takes away the terror and replaces it with laughs. It's a crying shame that director\/writer Richard Wenk didn't do more films because he had a great approach to filmmaking a cross between John Hughes (16 Candles) and the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team (Airplane!).IMPORTANT NOTE If you buy the DVD, which you must, be sure to get the 2001 Starz\/Anchor Bay release, NOT the 2011 Image Entertainment release. Why? Because the 2001 release includes the hilarious Richard Wenk short film Dracula Bites the Big Apple. His first film short, this is what got him the Vamp gig, and you don't want to miss it. Why they didn't include it in the 2011 release (dvd OR blu-ray) is beyond me.So there you have it. See this film for the 80s nostalgia, see it for Sandy Baron, just see it. Other campy 80s gems I recommend are The Alien from L.A. (1986) which was Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Kathy Ireland's big break, Elvira Mistress of the Dark (1988) which is so bad it's ...well... BAD.

The premise of having a movie-idol step out of the screen and into the life of an adoring fan is brilliant but Allen layers it up even more by giving us the unamused reactions of the fellow-characters in the movie now stranded without purpose and to paraphrase Pirandello, in search of a screenplay and especially having the real-life actor rush out from Hollywood to confront his on-screen persona about damaging his reputation with his walk-out.The film could presumably work in any era but works best here in 1930's America when Hollywood's Golden Age was born out of the unemployed and low-paid citizens' need for escapism. The settings are wonderful, from the small movie-theatre, the cheap café where Mia Farrow haphazardly works and the abandoned fairground where she and her movie-beau hide out, superbly captured in a golden hue by Gordon Jenkins, while the sympathetic use of background music of the era further enhances the atmosphere.After the eye-popping scene when Jeff Daniels' lantern-jawed matinée-idol literally breaks out of character, there was a danger that Allen had played his hand too early and written himself into a corner, but by re-focusing on Farrow's back story, particularly her going-nowhere relationship with her user-abuser husband and the intricacies of the movie within a movie within a movie premise, he steers it to a (forgive the oxymoron) satisfyingly inconclusive ending, telling us that even in movies, happy endings aren't guaranteed.The acting all-round is excellent, Farrow very good as the put-upon housewife seeking release from her drudgery, Daniels too in a twin-part (sort of) neatly delineating the difference between real-life and screen persona, without literally running away with himself. I was also pleased that Allen kept himself out of the movie as an actor, although it is still possible to hear his characters talking in his language and rhythms so that you couldn't mistake the writer of the piece.The only carp I really have is the relative lack of humour, as outside of the catty squabbling of the abandoned movie actors, there are no real laugh out loud moments.

Do not get me wrong, it was by no means horrible; it was a certainly a decent and watchable flick, but I can't help but feel disappointed by it.The acting is solid enough, with Connery giving a very confident and convincing portrayal of 007, and his usual supporting cast at MI6 doing decent jobs as well. Gert Frobe was also quite good as goldfinger. In addition there are some great one-liners, a memorable henchman in Oddjob, the introduction of the fully equipped Aston Martin, a great pre-credits sequence with the explosion and fight at the Caribbean party, and the theme song, performed by Shirley Bassey is one of the best in the entire movie series. Certainly Goldfinger has some of the greatest moments in Bond history, so where does it go wrong?While Goldfinger essentially invented the now standard fun Bond blueprint that everyone knows and loves (the crazed villain, the cheesy one liners, the tricked out car, the gadgets, the epic battle at the end, Bond bedding girls left and right throughout the picture, etc.), it all feels strangely pedestrian when compared to the later pictures that nailed the crowd-pleaser style of Bond movie. Goldfinger's biggest crime is that it is just rather dull and uninteresting most of the time. Instead of taking the viewer to marvel at some of the most beautiful locations in the world, most of this movie takes place in Kentucky (although Geneva was cool). The fight scenes are mostly clumsy, except for the one in the beginning. Instead of saving the day, Bond basically just sits in jail most of the time and lets other people do the work for him (he did not even defuse the bomb at Fort Knox). Goldfinger is a transition between the earlier Fleming inspired movies, and the later more outrageous ones without having the benefits of either. There is no sense of danger or suspense in the entire movie; mainly because Auric Goldfinger was one of the lamest, and most nonthreatening villains in Bond history, and add to the fact that his motives were vague and unclear, it is easy not to care about the plot of the movie or its outcome. At the same time it lacks the balls of the later flicks that had over the top ninja battles in Volcanoes, or Bond fighting a seven- foot behemoth while falling out of a plane with no parachute. Goldfinger had a mildly exciting car chase, and the likewise somewhat stimulating finale on the jet. There really is not much more to say. Goldfinger is a decent, but highly disappointing Bond flick. I personally found Dr. No to be far more interesting and suspenseful than anything in this movie, and also From Russia With Love ,and You Only Live Twice, and Thunderball, and Live and Let Die, and The Spy Who Loved Me, and Moonraker, and For Your Eyes Only, and Octopussy (yes even that one, at least it was more fun and had better action, even if it did have a similar plot) and even Goldeneye (though I thought it was kind of weak too).

As the other guy's review said, laconic. Clint Eastwood is that, he is laconic bad-ass and an outlaw by nature even if he is a cop. And that is what I really like in his acting, he manage to keep his format without conflicting with the characters he plays. Every time. Its sort like Al Pacino but more rigid, Pacino had his papers here he got more flexible and showed his skills.Now lets get to if you should watch this movie... A tip for choosing this movie is if you want to watch a police action movie. If you do, then maybe this will fit you. Although this is a police movie, the action scenes are more about showing of power and some suspense than of actual shooting at each other. This is Eastwood style. Like a modern far west movie with eye staring and running around. So if you are like that I do think you should go ahead and try.Now if you are in the mood of manly man fights and epic phrases you can do this too. The characters in this movie are also very strong, though not deep, they show off their acting by having unique personalities and back stories that are told by they actions. Very nice to watch and learn who they are without the director pointing that to you. So, take a time and watch because you will like.And for all the others out there, this maybe isn't that action fast paced movie that you watch on the afternoon to feel like a hero or a soldier so you may not like this. But still, you guys should experiment with it when you are not tired and want to try something out.
