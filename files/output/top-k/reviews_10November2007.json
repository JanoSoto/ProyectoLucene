As a comedy, not a drama, and especially as a mistaken identity plot bordering on farce, it isn't *supposed* to resemble a true-to-life documentary, OK? I don't understand those who say Ricki Lake shouldn't have been cast in the female lead role. Why? Because she isn't some A-list skeletal blonde? She played Connie\/Patricia admirably, and says that this is the role that made her the proudest to play. It was the first role, she said, where her weight didn't factor into the casting. Should she be sorry she's too average looking for some people's Hottiewood tastes? I don't think so. Who says ordinary women don't deserve love and romance too?We'll get the obvious out of the way first. Of COURSE Shirley MacLaine shines as Grace Winterbourne. That lady could play a seashell and be absolutely spellbinding. Of COURSE Brendan Fraser has women swooning over his Hugh\/Bill Winterbourne. That's what Brendan Fraser does. It's the smaller roles that make the movie wonderful Loren Dean is altogether tops as Steven DeCunzo, the abusive womanizing lowlife who fathers Connie's baby and then abandons her to the streets, ultimately getting what he richly deserves. Convincing? Hey, I wanted to smack him myself. Nesbitt Blaisdell stole the scene as the homeless man who befriends a very pregnant Connie. They pray at you, he warns her about a particular shelter, but the food's good. Miguel Sandoval is truly enjoyable as Paco, the butler. The only small problem here is that Paco's homosexuality is a trait I gathered only from script, not from character development. In other words, I just never would have guessed Paco was gay without it being said outright. For all I know Sandoval himself could be homosexual (I have no idea) and my saying that he doesn't believably portray one could be hilarious in its irony, but it just doesn't seem that way to me. What do I want, a stereotype? Probably. Farces are usually full of them. Farce is all about exaggeration, and exaggeration relies heavily on stereotype.My favorite scene in the movie has got to be the aftermath of the Sunny Side of the Street fiasco. Streetwise teenager tells catty blonde débutantes to f--- off, leaving them flabbergasted with shock. That's funny enough, but then smooth, cultured, filthy rich family matriarch comes along behind her with, You heard her. F--- off, which was one hundred percent hysterical.There's the scene at the train station where Paco delivers the line, You are as much a Winterbourne as I am, putting a lump in my throat.I do have trouble with the wedding scene at the end. Connie stops the proceedings (and nearly stops the priest's pulse as well) by unexpectedly saying no. She, Patricia Winterbourne, does *not* take Bill Winterbourne to be her husband. I, Constance Helen Doyle, do all that. And everything's back on again. My problem is that the marriage license would have read Patricia Winterbourne. They wouldn't have had time to correct it. Which, of course, would invalidate the ceremony, making Grandma Grace Winterbourne's closing line to baby Hughie--They're married--a false statement. Oh, no they're not. Also, I am forced to agree that Ricki Lake does NOT look like a character who just turned 18 years old. But hey, if I'm going to be consistent and say that farce isn't supposed to be completely believable, then we can suspend reality for those things too.To summarize, so what if Mrs. Winterbourne is a chick flick?

Then, it is followed by other action movies including DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE, EXECUTIVE DECISION and BROKEN ARROW. And now, we have THE ROCK, which is the latest of these long line of Mad Bomber movies. I bet you know what Mad Bomber movies are. Those are the action films which concerns a mad bomber who plans to blow up a bomb until his demands are assured, and the hero\/heroes, usually sent by the government, attempt to stop him. THE ROCK is just like that.Here's the setup, this time, our mad bomber is Brig. Gen. Francis Hummel, a well-decorated military officer for the Marines who also happens to be a Medal-of-Honor winner in Vietnam. So why does he want to do away with the country? Well, during the war, his men, who should have received honor, were abandoned without recognition. Now, Hummel demands $100 million to be given to each of the soldiers' families and threatens to launch a rocket containing biochemical weapons, while in the meantime, also holds hostages of tourists in Alcatraz. The government, who wouldn't want to risk too much with his demands, dispatches their own team to infiltrate The Rock, including Biochemicals expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) and a former British spy-turned convict (the only man ever to escape Alcatraz alive) named John Mason (Sean Connery, bringing in a tougher tone from his heroic Bond hero performance).After an escape and car chase scene along San Francisco, which can be summed up as a deluxe version of the chase scene in BULLIT, which is bound to blow up once in a while. After this car chase, upon arriving at The Rock, we are served up with more action and stunt scenes including some wild shoot-outs, a mine car chase (ala INDIANA JONES & THE TEMPLE OF DOOM), near-misses and a climax involving jets and a green flame.THE ROCK is directed by Michael Bay and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson, which might suggest where the robust action scenes have come from. Bay, a director who fancies a lot of explosions (including excess), manages to keep every sequence a show-stopper. THE ROCK borrows bits from a lot of favorite action films, and that's why, I think, it's so good.Bay also directed Armageddon which was released then later, which was also an even louder picture than this. Although I did like that picture, I still liked THE ROCK better, since it wasn't only another loud action picture, but also a very good movie. The performances, especially by Connery and bad-guy Harris, are terrific. Cage offers his own charisma as in his other films including CON-AIR (also Bruckheimer\/Simpson production).

See, the aurora borealis is especially strong on identical nights in 1969 and 1999, which enables cop John Sullivan (James Caviezel) to contact his own dead father (Dennis Quaid)on an ancient ham radio. The 1969 world's series plays an important part in the plot.But, so far, all you've got is a half-hour Twilight Zone episode. What happens after father and son get done being teary eyed and telling each other, I love you, Pop, and I love you too, Son, as if men really talked that way? Well, you have to have a serial killer back in 1969 and the policeman son has to help his fireman father stop the killings that took place thirty years ago, that's what happens. I don't mind serial killers in the movies anymore. I'm inured. More than that, if a movie does NOT have a serial murderer tucked away somewhere in the plot I begin to itch all over and break out in a rash that roughly resembles prickly heat. Would you take a look at this, doctor? Kamen's musical score is nothing to write home about, but the acting and directing are good enough, particularly Dennis Quaid, who brings a New York working-class accent to the role and does a nice impersonation of a guy pushing 70 at the happy ending. Andre Braugher is an exceptional actor with an extensive range. Also quite good is the performance of Shawn Doyle, who plays Jack Shepherd, the killer cop. He's got the role down perfectly. In many of his scenes he's not required to do much but be sinister or roll around in hand-to-hand combat with one of the Sullivans, but there is a scene in a bar, in which Cavaziel confronts the now aged Doyle, in which his face is a changeable and fleeting mask of indifference, curiosity, and hostility. And Doyle does it with a total absence of ham. And let's give makeup the round of applause it usually doesn't earn.The plot is complicated, as many time-warp films tend to be perforce, and there were times when I was confused, especially during the climactic action scene. In fact, I'm still a little -- well, maybe it's me. The plot also simplifies life in 1969, presenting us with nothing but happy homes straight out of a 1950s TV family series. I don't suppose you could really drag in Vietnam and racial conflict and dwell with such obvious relish on the same oneiristic images of innocence and Coca-Cola. If Dear Old Dad has a single flaw, it's that he smokes, and the film is politically correct and savvy enough to have him give up the habit grimly and with determination and a sense of moral rectitude. You can practically feel the audience breathe a sigh of relief and fresh air.Field of Dreams, in which a troubled son finally contacts his long-lost troubled father, was an extraordinary success in 1989 so I suppose this re-rendering eleven years later was expectable. Warner Brothers used to recycle the same plots with different actors in different jobs and the same underlying dynamics. It might be Edward G. Robinson working way up on the cable towers in Manpower or Bogart behind the wheel in They Drive By Night. It didn't matter. The underlying mythical armature remained the same. It won't matter here either.Years ago I pulled my car off the Trans-Canada highway to spend the night curled up in the back seat, parked on the outskirts of some small town in western Ontario. I was waked up by the barking and howling of dogs violating the post-midnight silence. What was bothering them were the northern lights, slowly shifting curtains of rainbow-colored hues, barely bright enough to lighten the landscape. That was in July in Ontario.

The last few years were extremely successful for the historical thriller in books and movies especially following the best selling success of the DaVinci Code. Still, the 'The Ninth Gate' inspired by the book by Spanish author Arturo Pérez-Reverte is quite a good film by itself, bridging between the devilish movies of the 90th and historical thrillers of the 2000s. It is a little bit too long, and loses interest in the last quarter, especially as the ending is not really very satisfactory, and the bigger mystery of the movie - the identity of the green eyes lady - is not really solved either, besides the very obvious explanation. Johnny Depp is a fascinating actor to watch in any film, although here he seems a little bit distracted or un-interested, as principal hero could have shown some more involvement in the the search of the Ninth Gate, or at least for the two gorgeous women who try to reach for his attention. Anyway we are left with a well filmed movie, good acting, and a decent story - overall good entertainment which is not little thing.

I saw it on television I believe in 1982, and I was hooked. Once we purchased a VCR, I rented it probably 15 times until it was priced for sell-thru in 1987. To me this movie and the following sequels are part of the definition of 80's culture. Every 12-18 months, these movies would pop up to the excitement of fans. The original, to me, is a great example of how a simple idea can be turned into a successful movie going experience. Is it a masterpiece...well, no. It is a movie that provides the shocks necessary to elevate it to the classic status it now has. I would love to see Adrienne King and Betsy Palmer turn up in some form or fashion in the remake, if produced, even if it's only as a cameo!
