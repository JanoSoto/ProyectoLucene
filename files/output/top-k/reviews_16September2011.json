Harker (Bruno Ganz) is sent by his employer, Renfield (Roland Topor), to Transylvania in order to finalize the the sale of a large estate to Count Dracula (Klaus Kinski). While housed in the count's ruined castle, it becomes evident that he is actually a prisoner by a blood-sucking fiend and makes his escape. Now, turning himself into a vampire, he must return to Germany and warn his wife Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) of the vampire that now stalks her.The truly remarkable thing about this film is that it doesn't fall into the typical trappings of remakes. That is, it doesn't become a slave to the original installment (ie, 1998's Psycho) while at the same time not straying to drastically from it (ie, 2008's The Day the Earth Stood Still). At the same time, it doesn't manage to lose the soul of the film by simply going through the artistic motions (ie, Let Me In). Instead, it joins of class of exceptionally well-crafted modern remakes, including 2004's Dawn of the Dead, 2006's The Departed and 2010's The Crazies and A Nightmare on Elm Street. Kinski's Dracula is a notably divergence from Shreck's Orlok. The monstrous inhumanity that characterize Shreck's vampire has given way to a more modern romanticization of the character. He's of the same brood as Louis de Pointe du Lac (the protagonist from Interview with the Vampire). He's a sad, (sym)pathetic killer who reviles his monstrous existence while fearing death far too much to change his ways. While Orlok lusted after Ellen with rabid appetite, this Dracula longs for her love. When he states that living and being unable to die is a cruelly fate than death itself, you believe him.While the first half of the moving (the parts spent getting to, set in and leaving Transylvania) lack the same unnerving intensity as this film's antecedent, the second half (the parts spent in Germany after the count's arrival) are significantly better. While in the first film it was possible to imagine that the plague was merely a clever ruse to allow Orlok to feed on the populace at his leisure, Herzog's film leaves no doubt in the viewer's mind (one genuinely off-setting scene features an entire street is crowded with funeral processions).From Ellen to Lucy, the female protagonist has completed a remarkable strengthening of character. In the original film, her excessive pining for Hutter threatened her health and, while she managed to trick Orlok into death, did so passively. In the remake she has become a strong, resolute woman who commands the attention of her husband (rather than his dismissive chiding), resists the temptations of the vampire, vigilantly guards her turning husband and pro-actively traps Dracula. Unlike 1990's remake of Night of the Living Dead (which featured a similar transformation in Barbara), Herzog didn't go overboard and make her the second (or, rather, first) coming of Sarah Connor.Fans of vampires (particular the original 1922 film or the various incarnations of Dracula), horror and Herzog will find this an exceptional remake of the 1922 classic.
