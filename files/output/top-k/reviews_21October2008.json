Basically every character within this movie is a great and classic one. I especially really liked the truly adorable little kitten Figaro. But of course also the Pinocchio character himself is a real classic and one of the most adorable ones ever created by Disney. I mean, whenever you hear the name Pinocchio you immediately think about the Disney Pinocchio don't you? But besides Pinocchio also Jiminy Cricket and Geppetto have grown into becoming some real classic characters.The movie its first halve is mostly fun and cheerful and features some nice comical moments as well. The second halve of the movie is more dark of tone and a bit more serous, though the movie luckily never looses its sense of fun and entertainment.I never really have been a too big fan of the movie its second halve. Probably because its too dark and serious of tone. Especially the movie its final part with Monstro doesn't really feel quite consistent with the rest of the movie. The first halve is mostly light and fun and enjoyable as you would expected from a Disney movie. But then again all earliest Disney movies have some more heavy and serious elements in it. Just look at the first ever long Disney animated movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which was actually quite dark at the times and even a bit horror like. Same also goes for Pinocchio. In all honesty, as weird as it might sound, but no way Disney would make an animated movie such as this one again. It's simply too scary and serious in parts.It's quite strange but the entire story in general actually doesn't connect well. I mean right the next day after Pinnochio had been brought to life by the Blue Fairy, Geppetto sends him to school and the movie is filled with story elements like that. The story often makes some very sudden leaps and there actually is very little interaction between Pinocchio and his 'father' Geppetto. Yet there relationship and basically everything else within this movie works out so well. It's simply Disney magic and these 'old' Disney movies just basically can do no wrong for me.Perhaps the only problem I have with these 'old' early Disney movies is its voice cast. While watching this movie again lately I couldn't help wondering of the movie actually wouldn't had been a better one if it had used some more well known actors to provide the movie its characters with their voices. It's probably because 'voice-actor' wasn't a real profession yet at the time and cartoons were not something credible enough to lend your voice to that the early Disney movies often use some unknown actors. It really sounds as if they were simply picked off the street and I truly feel that some big acting names could had brought the movie to an even higher level.The animations, as always, look good and it actually is impressive to watch these 'old' Disney animated then the newer ones, knowing how basic this movies got made, without the help of computers and anything like that. It's some real authentic craftsmanship and it also in no way looks outdated now days.It's also an early Disney movie to feature more than a couple of songs in it, though they are actually only present in the movie its first halve. The songs are all quite nice, of which 'When You Wish Upon A Star', performed by Cliff Edwards, is of course the most classic and memorable one.A real early Disney classic and still perfectly watchable to everyone, after all those years.8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"21 October 2008","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This is one of the fist feature length Disney animated movies and after all those years it also still is among one of the most classic and adorable ones.Pinocchio is a real adorable movie to watch, mostly due to its likable characters.

This movie was released a little while into the 21st century. This movie is definitely one of the better horror offerings given to us from the new era of film. One reason is simply because it manages to be somewhat different. The idea is nothing new, but I like the way it was executed. It introduced us to a very cool horror villain without having a pointless back story on it. The acting is also solid, the creepy tone is there, and the amazing feeling of terror is there throughout the entire film.The movie starts off with a regular looking brother and sister on a trip. This starts adding depth into the characters, but before long, the siblings' car gets attacked by an oversided truck. This leads to a very good opening car chase. This car chase uses plenty of Hitchcock style shots, which I thought was great. It is also followed by a very creepy scene where we see the villain dumping some dead bodies down into an abandoned church. This movie relies on this type of creepy atmosphere rather than gore or gross out scenes, although there are quite a few of those, too.This development in plot would lead to a chain of duologue scenes, which are actually pretty well done.As the movie movies on, the characters get even more developed, and it becomes easy to get involved with the movie this way. The viewer will continue to have that uncertain atmosphere along with the duologue, but that is the magic of Jeepers Creepers. Then; just when the viewer can't take it any more, we get introduced to a very fun action scene involving a decapitation. This scene marks as the halfway mark of the movie, which is where the frightening element ends and the fun begins.In my opinion, the first half of the movie worked better because it felt somewhat real. We've all had arguments with our siblings, we've all been lost on a country road; and the way the story is developed, the idea of a maniac chasing you down seemed somewhat believable. Well, after the movie begins with its second half, we learn more about this maniac. The story then begins to drag on a little to far, but since the movie turned into a fun action movie, I'll let this slide. I had fun as the movie progressed, and I began to feel more and more for the characters. This is VERY rare for any horror movie to come out after the year 1995, so I was highly impressed and amazed at this. The entire movie is very well set up, very well shot, and very well acted. Definitely a recommended movie.This movie DOES contain several problems, though. First off, I thought that the movie ended way too abruptly. I haven't heard a lot of people say this, but I simply think that the ending of this movie was rushed, and could have been executed better, but ever film has its flaws. I also thought that the CGI effects where downright terrible, but hey, what do you expect.Overall, I liked this movie, it's definitely worth a rent, if not a buy.FOR IN DEPTH HORROR REVIEWS CHECK OUT MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL HORRORREVIEWS123 ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"21 October 2008","score":"","review":" Jeepers Creepers is a somewhat well known horror movie released in the 21st century.

After the first time I saw it, I gave it a perfect 10 rating on IMDb, something I do very rarely (I've given out 20 ratings of 10 out of the 600+ movies I've rated). However, after just one viewing, I felt so impacted by this film that it immediately rocketed near the top of my favorite movie list. After a second viewing, I feel even more amazed by it than I was the first time I saw it. The movie captures your interest in the first scene and unfolds new plot points and character developments slowly at first and then more rapidly as the movie goes on. The movie runs about 130 minutes long, but it never gets boring. While it is admittedly slow paced, this only serves into its greatness. It allows the viewer to get to know the characters of Andy and Red and sympathize with them; along the way, we also get to know and grow attached to the other prisoners trapped inside Shawshank. The movie flows perfectly from one scene to the next, never feeling forced or losing your interest. The movie is mostly dialogue driven, but there are some violent scenes which help convey the brutality of prison life.Finally, the final 30 minutes are perhaps the most satisfying in any movie. I do not want to spoil the ending for those who have never seen it, but suffice to say, the final act of the movie leaves you floored. Both times that I saw it, I was rooted to my seat long after the credits rolled, just thinking about the brilliance of the ending and the entire movie as a whole. Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction are both great movies, highly entertaining. I particularly love Pulp Fiction; however, it is a travesty that The Shawshank Redemption did not win Best Picture. It was certainly the best film of the year in my opinion, arguably the best film of the decade, and perhaps one of the finest movies ever made. The even bigger tragedy, though, is that while Morgan Freeman earned an Oscar nomination for his great performance, Tim Robbins' turn as Andy Dufresne went without a nomination. Robbins carries the film, and his performance is truly one of the greatest I have ever seen. The bottom line is that The Shawshank Redmption is a perfect movie. It takes you in from the opening scene and doesn't let you go until long after it comes to a tremendous close. Along the way, it will make you think, fear, wonder, and feel a number of other emotions. If you have not seen this movie, waste no time; go rent it today and see why this is the highest ranked film on IMDb.

It is immensely entertaining and easily one of the best black comedies I've seen in a long time. Network exaggerates a lot, but is sadly a testament to most television networks in that most of them do anything for better ratings. Find out what the people like and give them what they want. With an impressive and talented cast and a capable director, Network is a solid, well written film with few problems and a lot of satire.From the first few scenes, I thought Network would be one of those preposterous, unbelievable movies that would have me rolling my eyes at the idea of it being considered a classic. I was wrong. The film does very well in its purpose of showing the lunacy that goes on behind the scenes of television. We have a news anchor who goes crazy and, when ratings skyrocket, his well-being is the last thing that anyone is worried about. The characters here all seem to get caught up in making this fictitious television network the hottest thing on the tube. It is exaggerated, yes, but it makes a firm point and does so in a satirical manner that leaves the viewer satiated.Probably the best thing about Network is the wonderful, wonderful dialogue. Every word is sharp and it contains some of the most quotable lines in the history of cinema. Most notably, the famous, I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore! delivered rather brilliantly by the late Peter Finch (who, deservedly, won a posthumous Oscar for the role). The rest of the cast is equally brilliant, especially the always-delightful Faye Dunaway, who plays a woman obsessed with getting to the top. William Holden, Robert Duvall, and Ned Beatty are all solid in their roles as well.There's never a dull moment here and, although the ending was a bit extreme, the film makes its point in a way that is both amusing and thought-provoking. Even though it's over thirty years old, Network is still relevant to today and, aside from the lack of cellular phones and personal computers, is not in the least bit dated. I have a feeling it'll also become one of those films that becomes more rewarding with each additional viewing. Here's a DVD I can't wait to add to my collection.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 October 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Network is one of those films that sticks with the viewer long after the credits roll.

I have a feeling it'll also become one of those films that becomes more rewarding with each additional viewing.

Her London\/English accent sounded a bit bizarre ; when I first saw this film, I'd thought she was English. However, I think it would have made much more sense if the casting directors had opted to hire an 'English' born actress for the role of Silvia instead.On the way, Sylvia's charm and beauty attracts the attention of fellow Englishman, Christopher Casonove (Note I use the term English as opposed to British here, in an attempt to dispel any confusion and to say that 'Britain' is made up of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). Later on, Peter suddenly develops feelings for Sylvia and when he finds out she is going to marry her English boyfriend, he, alongside Jack and Michael fly to England to stop Sylvia from proposing to him.The film is set within the English countryside backdrop (according to this site, it says it was filmed in Oxfordshire), and so rather you only get a glimpse of one part of English culture and not the rest, which is unfortunate. Many American and overseas films and TV shows in their portrayal of British\/English culture and the people, have a habit in depicting British people as either upper- class snobs speaking with posh accents or the Queen's English for instance, or with Dick-Van Dyke, 'Oliver' Cockney London accents.I think this is partly because people outside the UK view the nation as being nothing more than London itself- which is a problem and many of them are unaware of the different accents and regions that exist in and around the UK, such as Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Birmingham, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Cardiff etc. Also people confuse England with Britain, which coincidently, is not the same thing. The lack of Media representation of these cities and its people to the wider world in both TV and film needs to addressed, if we are to get beyond the 'geezer' and 'maa'm' stereotypes.Apart from the much stereotypical portrayal of us Brits, Three Men and a Little Lady, is in itself, a lacklustre sequel to what was, in my view, a very good movie, first time round. It is very sickly sweet in most places, some of the jokes are quite flat as well and it is a bit too 'hammy' for my liking. For a so-called light- hearted movie, there are less laughs to be found and the plot and narrative is all-too predictable that you'd be able to figure out what is going to happen in the end.The soundtrack is great though; Boy Meets Girl's worldwide smash- hit of 89','Waiting for a Star to fall' is still one of the most infectious-yet equally memorable movie songs of all-time.Overall, Three Men and a Little Lady is a disappointment; well I didn't really like it that much, but if you liked the first movie so much, then give this one a spin. Otherwise, there are better family films on the market, which whilst a lot of them aren't as similar to 'Three Men and a Little Lady'- plot-wise, they offer a lot more for your money, in contrast.

People ask questions like What do you do on your free time? or What is your favorite song?. But the toughest question to ask somebody is what their favorite movie is. A non-regular movie-goer might not have a bad time answering. A girl might go for The Notebook or Titanic, while a male might chose Lord of the Rings, Star Wars or any action flick. I personally have trouble deciding among Clockwork Orange or Pulp Fiction, but my favorite movie of all time must be Trainspotting. Trainspotting is a Scottish movie, based on a book by the same name and starting Ewan McGregor as Renton. Although he is the movie's main focus, we meet other characters who enrich the cinematic experience. Sickboy, Spud, Swanney, Tommy, Diane, and Begby. Most of these guys with a little problem, they're heroin addicts. Some try to quit and others join in the process. The movie clearly portrays all the risks and disadvantages of being involved in this world and the negative things it eventually leads to, but, at the same time, the characters never deny the satisfaction that this vice gives to them. Take the best orgasm you've ever had... multiply it by a thousand, and you're still nowhere near it, Renton narrates at some point in the movie. The real reason why this is my favorite movie is simply because your average friend can watch it and know for certain that he has seen an excellent movie. He will not be confused by Pulp Fiction, or distressed by A Clockwork Orange. Certainly it is a movie you should see if you still haven't. It gets you glued to your sit until the fabulous ending. The soundtrack is also a highlight, featuring songs from artists such as Blur, Brian Eno, Pulp, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed and of course Underworld, with its memorable song, Born Slippy, all placed in perfect timing with the movie's screening. So next time you go to your video rental, Choose Life, choose Trainspotting.

Which is odd because Jeremy Irons has never really done anything remotely laughable.Irons had company in the theatre of the absurd acting style and that was with back up villain played by Bruce Payne as, Damodar in blue lipstick and shaved pate, delivering lines like a macho Tim-Frankenfurter-Curry.And that is what is at odds with some of the primary components of this movie. I'm sure they did not want the villains to be completely laughable because they would have wanted them to generate enough fear or dread from the audience so they would be concerned for the welfare of the goods guys.Then you have the good guys, Justin Whalin as Ridley and Marlon Wayans as Snails, who are suppose to have the kind of lighted hearted swashbuckling, devil-may-care, attitude which has been a foregone cliché' in the forms of Han Solo and Indiana Jones. However in D&D the lead character, Ridley, was more like a generic Starbuck from the TV series Battlestar Galactica. Marlon Wayans as the reluctant Snails had lines that were suppose to be comic relief but were flat and lackluster.I do want to say that I am a huge fan of the Sword and Sorcery genre. I have read many of the great books from Robert Jordan, The Wheel of Time series, Terry Brooks the Shannara series, and as well as the first three Dragon Lance novels by Margaret Weiss and Tracy Hickman. I really enjoyed those books. So don't get me wrong I do love the genre and I know what it takes to make a good Sword and Sorcery story, yet I was expecting more out of this movie.The character of the Empress Savina, played by Thora Birch was so visually reminiscent of Queen Amidala from the Phantom Menace that I could not help but be reminded of Amidala every time Birch was on the screen in those over the top costumes.The story to D&D is real predictable. You know the standard, OH my God the Princess, Empress-whatever- is in trouble and the evil mean guy is going to ruin everything for her and that will be terrible because she is so nice and concerned about her people-and she's a hot looking unit to boot- so we have to get some reluctant swashbucklers to go through a whole bunch of cool exciting stuff and find a magical thing that will make everything better just in the nick of time before evil mean guy can make the Princess or I mean the Empress lose everything and cry her pretty Hollywood mascara saturated eyes out.There is a scene in this movie where the character Ridley has to navigate a maze to obtain an important component in finding the magical thing to help the Princess err I mean the Empress. This was like a cross from Return of the Jedi and all The Indiana Jones flicks combined. I couldn't believe there wasn't one original pitfall in the whole thing.You know I always thought Dragons were supposed to be formidable and intelligent. At least in all the books I read they were. Remember George Lucas's early eighties production of Dragon Slayer? That dragon for its time was awesome and fearsome. The Dragons in this movie were so blatantly computer generated that there wasn't anything remotely sentient or frightening about them. I don't know if they want people to think that in the world of Dungeons and Dragons the Dragons look cool as unapologetically CG creations? The grand finale battle scenes were disturbing in that I kept thinking, What are those X-wing fighters flying around out there? You see there were so many dragons flying around and spraying fire out causing other dragons to go crashing to earth like jets or X-wing fighters in a dogfight.

Filmed on location amid the streets of Rome, it looks ragged and gritty, and much more aged than other films from the same time period, but given its subject matter and the history of its making, I wouldn't have it any other way.Anna Magnani is probably the most recognizable actor in the film -- she would go on to win an Academy Award ten years later for her performance in The Rose Tattoo. But part of the film's appeal is that the people in it don't look or feel like actors, which makes the events in it feel that more immediate, like they're happening to real people.The movie does get a little heavy handed in its depiction of the Germans as sadistic animals, but I think this can be forgiven, since Rossellini was making this film even while Germans were occupying Italy.

Since Halloween is apparently a good time to transfer an inmate who is notorious for getting a little violent on the holiday, Michael escapes hospital care, returning home to find his niece, Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris). Jamie is the daughter of Laurie Strode -- who has incidentally passed away between films -- and is now under foster care. While Jamie goes trick or treating with her foster sister Rachel (Ellie Cornell), Dr. Loomis (surviving the explosion in Halloween II along with Myers) joins forces with a reluctant new police chief to stop Michael in his tracks before he trims another branch off his family tree. But, as you'll see by the end, history has a way of repeating itself.Director Dwight Little is no John Carpenter and that much is apparent from watching his incarnation of Michael Myers. Rather than try for suspense like the first two films, Halloween 4 goes the slasher route, ala Friday the 13th. It should come as no surprise, as the year was 1988 and the genre was either blossoming or bloating, depending on who you ask. Keeping that in mind and remembering that Little was lacking in the experience department, this fourth installment is actually one of the more respectable and substantial of the series. While conjuring up some fresh visuals -- such as in the opening credits -- Little's film has a tendency to look a bit pedestrian and doesn't quite carry the suspense that is so synonymous with the Halloween brand. What the film lacks in suspense, however, it makes up for in likable, believable characters and a swiftly moving plot. The character of Jamie Lloyd -- a traumatized and insecure seven year-old -- is sold perfectly by Danielle Harris, who would later reprise her role in Halloween 5 The Revenge Of Michael Myers and play another, altogether different role in Rob Zombie's recent remake. Harris rises above the typical child-actor stigma and delivers a performance that feels honest and real. Truth be told, if not for the character of Jamie and the portrayal by Harris, this would be a very different film. Her co-star, Ellie Cornell, is the ideal girl-next-door type, the perfect successor to Jamie Lee Curtis. Too bad we haven't seen much of her in modern films. Donald Pleasence is classic as Dr. Loomis, driving the character deeper into madness than he was in the second film. While the plot of the film is pretty basic and feels familiar, it works well because it moves so fluidly.

His presence literally fills the screen every time he appears, in part due to his considerable girth, but more so I think because of the intense characterization he imbues his portrayal with of police captain Hank Quinlan. Quinlan embodies the personification of the movie's title, and one would be hard pressed to think of another actor who could have done the job better. Fans of noir films may be surprised to see the cinema form elevated a considerable notch above it's traditional 'B' movie platform here. From the intense cinematography to the expansive story straddling the Mexican American border, the picture reveals one sordid surprise after another as it rages across the screen. Yet at the same time, one must suspend a good measure of disbelief at some of the less credible elements that are offered in support of Mike Vargas' (Charlton Heston) mission to solve a murder mystery. Virtually neglecting his wife (Janet Leigh) on their honeymoon to help investigate a case in which he has no jurisdiction is just the beginning. The way the new Mrs. Vargas handles herself in a handful of precarious situations simply defy anyone's definition of acting rationally in extreme circumstances. I just can't picture a real life scenario where a woman would openly challenge the supremacy of a mob boss on his home turf and expect to get away with it.All of which creates a unique dichotomy.

The genre remained popular in the forties and fifties; indeed, Marilyn Monroe made two films of this type in the same year, of which this was the second. The other was Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, although the title How to Marry a Millionaire could equally well have applied to either film. (Monroe's co-star in Gentlemen&#133;., Jane Russell, followed it up with The French Line in which she plays a girl who has the opposite problem; she has plenty of money but can't find a man.) Gentlemen Prefer Blondes teamed Monroe with another of the big-name sex symbols of the period. How to Marry a Millionaire goes one better and teams her with two other big-name actresses, Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable. (Grable was certainly regarded as a big name in 1953, even if today she is less remembered for her films than for the fact that her legs were once insured for a million dollars).In Gentlemen&#133;. Marilyn played the exotically named Lorelei while Russell's character was more prosaically named Dorothy. In this film it is Monroe who has the nearest thing to a normal Christian name (Pola), whereas her companions are the curiously named Schatze (presumably derived from Schatz, the German for treasure) and the equally curious Loco. (From the Spanish for insane. Either that or her father was a keen train-spotter).The three stars play models sharing a New York flat. All of them have ambitions to marry a wealthy man. There are three separate plot lines. Schatze is dating the wealthy, cultivated widower J.D. Hanley, but he is concerned that he is too old for her. (He is 55, she 25). Loco has agreed to go with a businessman to his lodge (believing he is referring to an Elks Club meeting) but it turns out that he is married, that the building in question is actually a hunting lodge in Maine and that his intentions towards her are far from honourable. Pola is interested in a dubious oil tycoon but is saved from him when she accidentally gets on the wrong plane at the airport. (Her bad eyesight, and her reluctance to wear glasses, are running jokes throughout the film).Today the gold digger genre seems outdated, even offensive. Feminists will take offence at the suggestion that every woman's ideal in life should be marriage to a wealthy man. Masculists (if such a word exists) might take offence at the idea that a man's worth, either as a husband or in any other capacity, can be measured by the size of his bank balance. There have been modern romantic comedies such as Pretty Woman or Maid in Manhattan on the theme of poor girl marries rich man (and some such as Notting Hill on the theme of poor boy marries rich woman), but the heroines (or heroes) of such films are not normally as coldly calculating as Schatze or Lorelei. Even in 1953 mercenary attitudes of this sort were not to everyone's taste- including, it would seem, the taste of the scriptwriters. All three girls undergo a change of heart by the end of the film.Despite my reservations about films of this type, I still found that Gentleman Prefer Blondes remains enjoyable more than fifty years after it was made. It may lack any great depth, but the script is often witty, the musical numbers are good and there is good chemistry between Russell and Monroe. How to Marry a Millionaire is not, however, really in the same class. Marilyn, admittedly, is charming, as she normally was, but her acting skills are not tested in the same way as they were in the earlier film. Neither Grable nor Bacall makes much of an impression. I cannot agree with the reviewer who felt that Bacall was too old for her role (at 29 she was only slightly older than the character she was playing), but I felt that remark might better have been directed at Grable. A twenty-something gold digger might be amusing; a woman in her late thirties playing the same game is likely to seem either sinister or pathetic. The film also lacks the musical numbers which were one of the better features of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.The script and the storyline might have seemed daring and sophisticated in the early fifties, a time when the Production Code meant that film censors were a lot more censorious than they are today. There were, however, limits to daring and sophistication. Marilyn is forced to say Men are seldom attentive to girls who wear glasses because the censor objected to the phrase make passes. There are a few in-jokes; a line about diamonds are a girl's best friend is a clear reference to Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, and Schatze, referring to older men marrying younger women, says look at old fella what's his name in The African Queen. (I.e. Bacall's real-life husband Humphrey Bogart). Much of the material, however, seems dated and stale today. How to Marry a Millionaire may have seemed witty in 1953; today it is one of Monroe's more forgettable vehicles. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 October 2008","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Films about the activities of gold diggers, young women scheming to marry a wealthy man, were a popular form of comedy in the early years of the cinema; in the 1930s there were several films which featured gold digger in the title.

In this film it is Monroe who has the nearest thing to a normal Christian name (Pola), whereas her companions are the curiously named Schatze (presumably derived from Schatz, the German for treasure) and the equally curious Loco.

Loco has agreed to go with a businessman to his lodge (believing he is referring to an Elks Club meeting) but it turns out that he is married, that the building in question is actually a hunting lodge in Maine and that his intentions towards her are far from honourable.

Feminists will take offence at the suggestion that every woman's ideal in life should be marriage to a wealthy man. Masculists (if such a word exists) might take offence at the idea that a man's worth, either as a husband or in any other capacity, can be measured by the size of his bank balance. There have been modern romantic comedies such as Pretty Woman or Maid in Manhattan on the theme of poor girl marries rich man (and some such as Notting Hill on the theme of poor boy marries rich woman), but the heroines (or heroes) of such films are not normally as coldly calculating as Schatze or Lorelei.

It may lack any great depth, but the script is often witty, the musical numbers are good and there is good chemistry between Russell and Monroe. How to Marry a Millionaire is not, however, really in the same class. Marilyn, admittedly, is charming, as she normally was, but her acting skills are not tested in the same way as they were in the earlier film. Neither Grable nor Bacall makes much of an impression. I cannot agree with the reviewer who felt that Bacall was too old for her role (at 29 she was only slightly older than the character she was playing), but I felt that remark might better have been directed at Grable. A twenty-something gold digger might be amusing; a woman in her late thirties playing the same game is likely to seem either sinister or pathetic. The film also lacks the musical numbers which were one of the better features of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.The script and the storyline might have seemed daring and sophisticated in the early fifties, a time when the Production Code meant that film censors were a lot more censorious than they are today. There were, however, limits to daring and sophistication. Marilyn is forced to say Men are seldom attentive to girls who wear glasses because the censor objected to the phrase make passes. There are a few in-jokes; a line about diamonds are a girl's best friend is a clear reference to Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, and Schatze, referring to older men marrying younger women, says look at old fella what's his name in The African Queen. (I.e. Bacall's real-life husband Humphrey Bogart). Much of the material, however, seems dated and stale today.

The genre remained popular in the forties and fifties; indeed, Marilyn Monroe made two films of this type in the same year, of which this was the second. The other was Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, although the title How to Marry a Millionaire could equally well have applied to either film. (Monroe's co-star in Gentlemen&#133;., Jane Russell, followed it up with The French Line in which she plays a girl who has the opposite problem; she has plenty of money but can't find a man.) Gentlemen Prefer Blondes teamed Monroe with another of the big-name sex symbols of the period. How to Marry a Millionaire goes one better and teams her with two other big-name actresses, Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable.

We follow Laurie Strode to the town hospital where she is treated for injuries sustained during Michael's attack and in a drug-induced haze, starts remembering disturbing parts of her childhood that were blocked out long ago. Naturally, Michael finds her there, and with the town police force slow to pick up on his plans, a dangerous game of cat and mouse ensues.For the most part, Halloween II is typical slasher fare. Although Halloween creators John Carpenter and Debra Hill still had a hand in it, the sequel is hardly in the same class as it's predecessor nor does it have half the suspense. Regardless, as far as sequels go, this one is still worth a go-round. Instead of just giving us more bloodshed for the sake of more bloodshed (and don't worry, there's more bloodshed), a back-story is created for both Michael Myers and his helpless victim, Laurie Strode. The film's director, Rick Rosenthal, does his best to match the tension and the grisliness of the first film, but sometimes it falls flat. There is one scene in particular where we follow a security guard into the basement of the hospital that goes on forever. I'm not exaggerating when I say time stops for this scene, and that's a perfect example of this film's main flaw. Rosenthal isn't Carpenter and it is obvious. Halloween II wants to be the companion piece to the original so bad that it tries to match it, but can't. To be honest, the movie is at it's best when it acts as a slasher sequel and works on the story being told. While being a bit convoluted, the revelation that is made in this film regarding Michael's connection to Laurie is an interesting one and sets the stage for a rather dramatic third act. There are other positives to this film as well. Take the main setting of the film, the hospital. Most of the film takes place there and it is utilized rather well, making way for some truly unsettling moments, such as Michael passing through a room full of newborn children. The make-up\/effects are quite a prominent feature of this film, and although not the main focus, are just as good as anything else from it's time. Most of the actors who survived Halloween show up in the sequel, but it is Jamie Lee Curtis and the iconic Donald Pleasence who steal the show. Curtis, despite playing a character out of commission for the bulk of the film, conveys the sheer terror and confusion necessary for the situation. Pleasence is great as he always is, as Michael's doctor turned arch-nemesis. He would return for three more sequels and this was just the beginning of his mad doctor routine. If you can accept that the more, more attitude of horror sequels is in full effect here and that, other than in story, it bears little to no resemblance to the original's feel and tone, then all is fine. Despite some flaws, Halloween II is still a worthy sequel. At the very least, it keeps the story interesting, all while updating the style and effects for the 80's. Afterall, how good could a sequel to such an influential film be? This film falls in line with other #2's such as Jaws 2 and Psycho II in that it is good, but has got nothing on it's source material.

As a film it holds everything thats needed, Emotions, romance, war, rights, drugs, and of course.... The shrimping industry. I don't think i will ever see a film like this again, and i can watch Gump over and over again, i literally know it word for word. For all those critics that hate this film, i really don't think they know what they are talking about, and perhaps they had trouble childhood maybe?I normally am a huge horror fan and my DVD case is full of horror movies so it goes to show how much i rate this film, because its far form a horror movie.Love the FIlm!

Hackman is convinced that he is putting the young couple's lives at risk. The Conversation is a a fascinating study on character. Gene Hackman carries the film with honesty and intensity. John Cazale was one of our most gifted actors, and he left s too early. Allen Garfield is always true to his character and completely fun to watch. The cinematography by Bill Butler fits right in with the lonely existence of our main character and also the paranoia that ensues. David Shire's music as well as the production design by Dean Tavoularis enhance that.The director, Francis Ford Coppola, expresses himself like never before. The Godfather movies are classics and great works of art (1 and 2) and this is not competing with them. But I get the feeling that The Conversation expresses more of the filmmaker's own feelings and point of view. So, in that sense, I feel that it is more artistic. Coppola has given us some great movies, this being my favorite. I look forward to him coming back with that fire in his belly to deliver another one.

It's needed by some terrorist organization. One snowy day Alex is home alone and the terrorists attack. Alex manages the single-handedly hold them off.OK--I hated the first two. The first one I saw opening night. The audience was full of families. All the adults sat there is deep silence--the kids were laughing hysterically. I was horrified. The second one I was dragged to. Same thing--kids loved it, adults didn't. This one I was trapped into seeing with all adults. They actually seemed to like it. The appeal of this is beyond me. The comedy is extremely violent--makes the Three Stooges look subdued. Also the bobby traps this 9 year old kid sets up are impossible for ANY kid to do! I found the movie sick and sadistic and didn't even crack a smile once. Also some of the hilarious things that happen to the terrorists would kill any person immediately. Also Linz does the impossible--his acting was so bad he makes Macaulay Culkin look like Laurence Olivier! But if you liked the first two you'll probably like this.
