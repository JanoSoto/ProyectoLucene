This is a very powerful movie that will leave you very sad and depressed about the story of Christiane. I have been on the verge of tears all day thinking about this poor child's life.As noted in other reviews, this is a very dark film that portrays childhood drug abuse in Berlin in the late 70's. It is not for the faint of heart, as there is death; many needle scenes, vomiting from the characters and prostitution scenes. The story is not happy and it is a downward spiral of one child's sorry life in Berlin. The only happy moment comes in the last 30 seconds of the film, as it is depressing all the way up to the end. But, this is a love story (a dark one) about Christiane and Detlev and their journey through the life of drugs as teenagers in Berlin. Even though the relationship is damned, it is still touching.Now to the facts, the film boasts some very good teenage actors in a 14-year-old Natja Brunckhorst as Christiane and Thomas Haustein as Detlev. Both portray emotions common to the characters lack of confidence, desperation, depression and denial very well. Both characters are very believable and you will form an emotional attachment to both. The soundtrack is all David Bowie, which really provides an excellent set of moments with the music. I was very impressed that his music could be placed so well into a movie.The DVD version comes in the original German language version and a dubbed English version (which I saw). Now, I wish I knew German (or it had subtitles) as I would much rather have heard the original actors voices, than the 20-year-old voice that is dubbing Christiane. Regardless, the movie can still be enjoyed in this format. The DVD also comes with no frills; it's just the movie. I really think a movie of this caliber should have actor interviews, a Christiane biography, or whatever, as this film will leave you wanting more. Hopefully they address this with a future release, as well as English subtitles for the German language version.This movie I feel is really a lot stronger than some of the other drug movies that I have seen Drugstore Cowboy, Traffic, etc.. and I would highly recommend it over the others, as it is a very touching story about the dark side of life.And last show it to your kids to show them the realities of drugs. Kids need to know that they can die form drugs. The only problem I have is this movie is based off of heroin, which is not a popular drug today, so it might not be as believable to teenagers.

He knew from his job that the pictures would result in the authorities being called.  He wanted them on his trail because he wanted to lead them to the adulterous William Yorkin.  When Nina Yorkin failed to react to the real photos of her philandering husband the way he'd hoped, Sy decides to give her some graphic `booster' shots, and give her husband a wake-up call at the same time.  Only when Sy is sure that the police have arrived at the hotel does he attempt to make his escape, thereby insuring the police will also encounter Yorkin and Maya in their hotel.  Thus, Sy makes it impossible for the Yorkins to go on living a lie.  I feel Sy believed he was saving them for their sake and for their son.

I found it to be very good, and better than such recent high profile thrillers as Minority Report and the like.  Matt Damon is good as the secret agent found floating in the Mediterranian Sea south of Marseilles and picked up for dead by fishermen. Poor guy, couldn't remember anything about who he was, but quickly figured out he must have had lots of training because his awareness and defense skills were second to none.SPOILERS - PLEASE DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER, OR ELSE!As everything unfolds we find out he was a highly trained assassin with a place in Paris and many different passports under many names. He had been sent by a highly covert operation to snuff an exiled former African leader who was threatening to expose things if he were not reinstated.

Fitting, since it was his first, as well. The story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie, from the little cons to the big cons to the all-encompassing con. It's like The Grifters, but without that film's level of acting. (In that film, John Cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character.) The acting here is very flat (I sometimes wondered if the bland acting by Crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis). At least in the beginning. It never gets really good, but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes. Early in the film, some of Lindsay Crouse's lines -- the way she reads them -- sound as if they're inner monologue or narration, which they aren't. With the arrival of Mantegna things pick up.The dialogue here isn't as fun as it should be. I was expecting crackerjack ring-a-ding-ding lines that roll off the tongue, but these ones don't. It all sounds very read, rather than spoken. Maybe Mamet evolved after this film and loosened up, but if not, then maybe he should let others direct his words. He's far too precious with them here and as a result, they lose their rhythmic, jazzy quality. What's more strange is that other than this, the film doesn't look or feel like a play. The camera is very cinematic. My only problem with Glengarry Glen Ross was that it looked too much like filmed theatre, but in that film the actors were not only accomplished, but relaxed and free. Everything flowed.I wouldn't mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines -- or even play characters speaking play lines --  but here it sounds like movie (or even book) characters speaking play lines. It's a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesn't work. That doesn't mean the movie is bad -- it isn't, it's often extremely entertaining. The best chunk is in the middle.It's standard con movie stuff the new guy (in this case, girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) gets involved in the seedy con underworld. How she gets involved is she's a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive gambler. She wants to help him out with his gambling debt, so she walks into The House of Games, a dingy game room where con men work in a back room. I'll admit the setup is pretty improbable. (Were they just expecting Crouse to come in? Were they expecting she'd write a cheque? Was Billy in on it? One of these questions is definitely answered by the end, however.)And from here the cons are start to roll out. I found the beginning ones -- the little learner ones -- to be the most fun. We're getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as Crouse is. We see the ending coming, and then we didn't see the second ending coming, and then the real ending I didn't see coming but maybe you did. The ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second Crouse walked into The House of Games she found her true calling.I'm going to forgive the annoying opening, the improbable bits and the strange line-reading because there are many good things here. If the first part of the movie seems stagy, stick with it. After the half-hour mark it does really get a momentum going. If you want a fun con movie, then here she is.

He's far too precious with them here and as a result, they lose their rhythmic, jazzy quality. What's more strange is that other than this, the film doesn't look or feel like a play. The camera is very cinematic. My only problem with Glengarry Glen Ross was that it looked too much like filmed theatre, but in that film the actors were not only accomplished, but relaxed and free. Everything flowed.I wouldn't mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines -- or even play characters speaking play lines --  but here it sounds like movie (or even book) characters speaking play lines. It's a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesn't work. That doesn't mean the movie is bad -- it isn't, it's often extremely entertaining. The best chunk is in the middle.It's standard con movie stuff the new guy (in this case, girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) gets involved in the seedy con underworld. How she gets involved is she's a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive gambler. She wants to help him out with his gambling debt, so she walks into The House of Games, a dingy game room where con men work in a back room. I'll admit the setup is pretty improbable. (Were they just expecting Crouse to come in? Were they expecting she'd write a cheque? Was Billy in on it? One of these questions is definitely answered by the end, however.)And from here the cons are start to roll out. I found the beginning ones -- the little learner ones -- to be the most fun. We're getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as Crouse is. We see the ending coming, and then we didn't see the second ending coming, and then the real ending I didn't see coming but maybe you did. The ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second Crouse walked into The House of Games she found her true calling.I'm going to forgive the annoying opening, the improbable bits and the strange line-reading because there are many good things here. If the first part of the movie seems stagy, stick with it. After the half-hour mark it does really get a momentum going. If you want a fun con movie, then here she is. If you want Mamet, go watch Glengarry Glen Ross again -- James Foley did him better.*** ","genre":"Crime, Thriller"},{"date":"1 March 2003","score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  There was not one bad thing I could say about this movie, except the Capitan should not have challenged the small-witted Rolfe into almost having his whole family caught.

Possibly many of the immature (i.e., the majority) moviegoers out there don't like to see a comedy that has a message, or, going the other way, a message movie with some comedic touches.  Cause that's what this is.  The Brothers Farrelly cannot seem to shed their penchant for bathroom humor but this time they've given you something to think about.  There is some meat on the bones of this movie.  You're supposed to think about it when its over, not like There's Something About Mary which was just a straight laugh riot. Hal is shallow (surprise) to the point of blindness and gets an emotional makeover when stuck in an elevator with Saturday morning infomercial god Anthony Robbins.  He 'casts a spell' so that Hal will only see the inner beauty in a person, or not see the outside but only see the inside..Then he meets Rosemary, who is overweight and pretty non-chalant about it. She knows who she is and how she appears and already knows what Hal just found out.  She volunteers at a hospital, is in the Peace Corps and gives leftovers to a homeless man.  She's a good person.  Hal's friend Mauricio is even worse, and he has less of a reason to be so quick to judge another person.  That's one of the main points, that Hal or Mauricio, or anyone for that matter, are far from perfect just like the entire human race, and this point is brought home when Mauricio refuses to date a woman whose second toe is longer than her big toe!  Meanwhile, he sprays his hair on, wears Members Only jackets and has a deformity that makes a big toe seem much more preferable.  So he's not really in any position to be so critical, but he is..This movie has a HUGE heart and I kind of can't believe that the Farrellys coaxed a tear from me, twice.  Once when Hal re-visits the pediatric ward at the childrens hospital, and again at the end. I don't even like Paltrow but she's fantastic in this.  So are Jack Black and Jason Alexander.  The movie is not perfect and I can pull it apart but I feel more like praising it for what value it has rather than what they got wrong.  8\/10.
