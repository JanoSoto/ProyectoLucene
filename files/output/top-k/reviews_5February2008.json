King Kong (1933) has never lost it's magic and is quite simply, one of the greatest films ever made! Everyone know the plot People go to island, girl gets kidnapped and sacrificed to a giant gorilla of a god called Kong. The rest is cinematic history as the story unfolds to it's ultimate conclusion.The main credit of this film is the stop-motion work by Willis O'Brien on Kong and all of the dinosaurs. It is the animation that really makes this film a classic. Nearly every little detail is perfect and there is barely any flaws in the continuity of the effects. The jungle sets and New York scenes are fabulous and work well as two different types of jungle. Although the characterisations are quite plain (they are given no back stories and have very little depth) the cast do a good job of portraying them, especially Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong. The producers did make good use of their past experiences for the film as the film expedition is based mostly on the real life expeditions of Merian c. Cooper and Ernest B. Scheodsack. When watching the movie, you can see that it had been planned out over a long period of time. The camera angles are clever and certain key scenes are particularly inventive like Kong's attack on the elevated subway train and the end. Other scenes such as the T-Rex fight and the stegosaurus charge are great but they could probably never measure up to the infamous lost spider pit scene which should not have been removed. But what of Kong himself? Yes he may be a 25 foot gorilla and Merian C. Cooper wanted to portray him as a fearsome beast but in the end you will feel sympathy for him as he finally sees his own blood. The look of shock on his face is totally real and a touch of greatness. Kong is a creature that evokes fear and sympathy. It is amazing to think that anyone could take an 18 inch model and make everyone believe it is a giant gorilla. But Willis O' Brien did that and created a movie icon. He is the 8th Wonder of the World. He is KING KONG! ","genre":null},{"date":"5 February 2008","score":"","review":" I first saw this movie when I was 4 years old and as of this comment I am 15.

This scenario puts extraordinary demands on lead actor Spencer Tracy, who is forced to hold the screen nearly alone for ninety minutes. Although he manages to ingratiate himself early on to the viewer, one still doesn't know how to take this character--is he likably stubborn or stubbornly foolish? Either way, Hemingway's tale doesn't quite make its mark as rousing cinematic material, however the finish is very satisfying. It gets a helping hand from Dimitri Tiomkin and his score, which won an Oscar.
