I must say I was surprised at just how good it was. Before, there had always been distractions, but today I watched it right through and I must say I was very impressed. It's the kind of film my parents would watch and so it never featured very high on my radar. But when I got into watching films more seriously this was always one of those that had a lot of critical acclaim and so I added it to 'The List'. It finally lands on TV and I had a chance to see it tonight&#x85; Truly excellent! I will explain what I mean by that after this very brief summary.At the beginning of World War II many people tried to get out of Europe and one of the preferred routes was via Casablanca to Lisbon and then on to America. Consequently there were many refugees stranded in Casablanca falling prey to corrupt officials and other less savoury characters. Bar owner Rick Blaine wants nothing to do with all this business, in fact he doesn't even like people talking politics in his place. But when certain travel documents fall into his possession he finds it hard to remain neutral. Particularly when an ex-lover, Ilsa Lund, appears on the scene with her husband Victor Laszlo. Throw in a corrupt, but charismatic, French Police official, Captain Louis Renault, a German, Major Heinrich Strasser who is bent on arresting Victor Laszlo and, of course, Rick's piano player, Sam, and you've got the makings of a really great film. I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police (Classics Division) will have me in a concentration camp (again).You would have thought a film made in black and white and shot in a 43 aspect ratio would be really hard to watch. I'm here to tell you it's one of the easiest films to watch I've seen it quite a while. All the action is concentrated in the middle of the screen; every shot is set up that way. I guess it helps that it is based on a stage play in that respect. Performance wise, well I cannot fault anyone, but I must give special praise to both Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund, both were truly excellent! Honourable mentions must also go to; Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo, Claude Rains as Captain Louis Renault, Conrad Veidt as Major Heinrich Strasser, Sydney Greenstreet as Signor Ferrari and Peter Lorre as Ugarte.I'm not usually all the big on love stories but in this case I will make an exception. I think it's the quality of the performances that really makes this work as well as it does. There is a lot of political intrigue in there too. If you remember that at the time it was being made America had not joined the war in Europe and so what it says politically is pretty important too. But getting away from the politics of the thing, I found this film totally engaging all the way through with characters you could believe in and a great script. I said it at the beginning and I'll say it again&#x85; Truly excellent and VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score 9.7\/10.IMDb Score 8.7\/10 (based on 204,219 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score 97\/100 (based on 59 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

Usually there is drama, comedy, and often surprising results. For me Breaking Away is certainly one of my top ten favorite sports movies, and quite possibly on my top five list.Breaking Away is a story about a teenage cyclist growing up in Bloomington, Indiana. Somehow he has become obsessed with the Italian cycling team. And whether his motivation is a unique way to meet young coeds at Indiana University or something else, he is an incredible cyclist.The fun part of this movie is his interaction with his mother Evelyn Stoller, who seems very understanding about his Italian cultural ways, and his father Ray Stoller, who doesn't understand why his son thinks he's Italian. Give credit to writer Steve Tesich whose script takes viewers on a humorous and believable adventure in this wonderful small-budget movie.Add in three friends who just graduated from high school, and this story is a fascinating jaunt with coming of age. Dennis Quaid plays a former high school quarterback, Jackie Earle Haley plays the short and defensive Moocher, and Daniel Stern plays Cyril, a student whose father likes to encourage him when he fails. Each of the supporting actors does a great job in helping to convey the story, but you can really see Daniel Stern's strength in comic acting in his first major movie role.The sports rivalry is actually established by the city kids called Cutters, competing for dates against the college male students. Eventually, the two rival groups compete against each other in a bike race called the Little 500. But honestly, the joy in this movie is the journey with all of the characters in the Peter Yates directed movie.As in life, there is humor and sadness, friends and family, rivals and conflict brought out on the big screen. This movie was surprisingly good the first time I saw it, and still enjoyable 30 years after its release. How good is Breaking Away? It won an Oscar in 1980 for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen with Steven Tesich doing a tremendous job in wordsmithing the script. The movie also received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress (Barbara Barrie), and Best Music, Original Song Score and Its Adaptation or Best Adaptation Score (Patrick Williams).Perhaps my best recommendation for Breaking Away is that I consider it better than that other famous Indiana sports movie about High School basketball. That's probably a minority view, but if you haven't seen Breaking Away, you have missed a jewel of a movie.

But I think in the original conception of the movie Trumbull didn't even have the film as being about the environment, it was a movie about encountering aliens. The second time I watched it I felt something very different going on and I felt a very close connection to Freeman Lowell. I've been intrigued as to receptions of this character as some have been applauding his death at the end of the movie.I think the key phrase of the movie is a story Lowell tells about being a kid, writing a message on a piece of paper, putting it in a bottle and throwing it in the sea, wondering if anyone ever picked it up.I think that no-one ever reads Lowell's message. I think the key thing about him is social ineptness, you can see at the beginning that his three crewmates, whilst (unfashionably outside of the diegesis) not buying his environmentalist arguments, are all to some extent sympathetic of Lowell at points, though antagonistic at others, more out of frustration at his ineptness. He isn't able to see their point of view and doesn't seem to realise that they aren't the enemy, he doesn't recognise either their sympathy or their antagonism, misreading these attitudes as either digressive or pigheadedly hostile respectively. Lowell eventually kills these three men, who are replaced for him by three compliant robots (played by bi-lateral amputees in a nod to Tod Browning's Freaks), who are a more fitting audience for him.I think that he kills these men and that's what he intended, but he has an empathy deficit and doesn't really know what he's doing, other than defending a cause. He becomes haunted by what he's done, by the comrades he's abandoned. Lowell's misplaced integrity is a kind of purity that deserves some sort of respect. His misunderstandings the stuff of high tragedy.I just wanted to point out as well that the first time I saw this movie I didn't see anything strange or unusual in Lowell's behaviour at all, I just straight saw him as a hero. As a background I have Asperger's Syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder that is characterised by significant difficulty in social interaction. I've been learning my way out of it since my late 20s, which is why I've seen this film differently the second time round. But I can hear the silence that Lowell hears, I was always confused as a youth by the phrase, No man is an island, which I regarded simply as inaccurate. There's something very wonderful about that silence, but incredibly sad as well. Maybe the saddest moment in many sad moments comes during his eulogy for the three men where he says that although they weren't his friends he did like them. This is an experience that I have shared a lot, perhaps up until only this year unilateral friendships where I admire people that don't like me at all, just because there isn't anyway you can express the love inside you when you're socially inept, you end up accidentally upsetting people all the time.I've tried to sum this all up in the review title, Everest Flower, because I wanted to think of the remotest place possible, with an amazing clean view, and just imagine a beautiful flower growing there amidst the snow, and that reminds me of Freeman Lowell, and the person I was.The plot of the movie can be a bit basic at some points, including long dark nights of the soul that a professional botanist suffers through whilst wondering why his plants are dying before realising the obvious, that the sun isn't shining enough when you're way out past Saturn. But I don't really care.

This is an experience that I have shared a lot, perhaps up until only this year unilateral friendships where I admire people that don't like me at all, just because there isn't anyway you can express the love inside you when you're socially inept, you end up accidentally upsetting people all the time.I've tried to sum this all up in the review title, Everest Flower, because I wanted to think of the remotest place possible, with an amazing clean view, and just imagine a beautiful flower growing there amidst the snow, and that reminds me of Freeman Lowell, and the person I was.The plot of the movie can be a bit basic at some points, including long dark nights of the soul that a professional botanist suffers through whilst wondering why his plants are dying before realising the obvious, that the sun isn't shining enough when you're way out past Saturn. But I don't really care.

Actually, I knew that as soon as I saw Brian De Palma's name. What I was hoping for was a solid piece of entertainment, possibly with over-the-top violence and drama a-la Scarface. I was shocked by how much I ended up disliking it.The first scene had a lot of potential, but it turned out that De Palma used up everything he had in that one shot - terrific cinematography, great art direction and costumes, and Robert De Niro. Those are pretty much the only things The Untouchables has going for it, and indeed, that first scene is one of the best in the entire film; the other standout scenes are Sean Connery's first two appearances, which probably earned him the very mysterious Oscar, but his character becomes bland in the second half and from then on his performance is less impressive, and it becomes ever more difficult to ignore his awful Irish accent. De Niro is impressive in his scenes, in a performance that's deliciously hammy and over-the-top, but it's not one of his best; even considering it's De Niro past his prime, in the rather slow period he had between Raging Bull and his comeback in Goodfellas, his Al Capone is still much less nuanced and less interesting than his characters in King of Comedy, True Confessions, The Mission, Once Upon a Time in America and Angel Heart.And still, Connery and De Niro are the best actors in this mess. Kevin Costner is wooden in Keanu Reeves levels; it doesn't help one bit that his character is one of the most deplorable in the film but played as an All-American Hero, which makes him hypocritical as well as unlikable. Charles Martin Smith, Jack Kehoe, Billy Drago and the rest are nothing but cardboard caricatures, while Andy Garcia has his moments but clearly has no idea what his character is about, no more than De Palma does. Most disturbing of all is Patricia Clarkson who gives an unintentionally eery performance as Costner's wife, who seems like something out of The Stepford Wives.On top of the bad acting and the shameless levels of historical inaccuracy, the film is a mess morally. Brian De Palma was never a master of moral ambiguity or subtlety, and here the morality is pure black and white, but he clearly doesn't really get what the story is actually about, and the result is a pretty enraging film with a hypocritical protagonist who goes on a killing spree and breaks every law possible to uphold a pointless law that he doesn't really care about, as the final scene clearly shows - yet the actor and director are both convinced that he's an infallible hero. All this in a movie full of clichés, with some moments that were taken right out of a Hallmark movie, with every possible 30's stereotype De Palma could think of, all of it very stylish but completely devoid of emotion. The explosion scene near the beginning is a perfect example.So why, on earth, was The Untouchables so well received when it was first released? Maybe some cosmic radiation made everybody in the late 80's and early 90's think that Kevin Costner is a good actor - that was finally over when he made the combo of Waterworld and The Postman. The Untouchables at least looks great - the costumes and art direction are excellent, and for that I give it four stars; there's also a Ennio Morricone score, which has some fine themes, however those have nothing to do with what's going on on screen and are generally disruptive. The best thing I can say about The Untouchables, overall, is that it's unusual and memorable. But not in a good way.

Hard Boiled is considered one of his best and it is certainly a very entertaining film just for its action scenes.Officer Tequlia Yuen (Chow Yun-Fat) is a Hong Kong police detective whom partner gets killed in a restaurant shoot out and he sets out to get the Triad leader that was responsible, Johnny Wong (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang). But when his boss Superintendent Pang (Philip Chan) orders Tequlia to stop his investigation, so he goes on a one man war against the Triads. Johnny has also recruited a top assassin and enforcer, Tony (Tony Leung). But it turns out he has his own secret and Tequlia and Tony ends up working to together bring down Johnny.Hard Boiled is around three major action set pieces, each getting bigger then the previous one. They were inventive and bloody. The restaurant had a tense had a tense build up with the boiling kettles, the police on there stake out and it became a big shoot out in a tight location and many innocent people get killed. It was almost like a Bruce Lee film, particularly with the score. The warehouse was just fun seeing men riding around on motorbikes, shooting people and also shows how one man could take on a small army. And the hospital set piece is just a massive pitch battle between the police and Triads, it was almost epic in scale because of the amounts of explosions, blood and bullets flying about. Whilst Woo does overuse slow motion and bullet sparks sometimes he does know how to craft an action scene, knowing where to focus, how to edit so you could follow what happens. I particularly like the long tracking shots in the hospital as all the action and carnage goes on all round, focusing on our two heroes. It is also very refreshing to see a film that does not need CGI, a film that actually uses stunt work and real special effects and it was shot very much like other action films from the 80s and 90s using a rather dark filter to it and most of the action takes place at night. Woo knows how to move the camera and does bring to live his own sense of hyper-realism. Hong Kong detectives seem to be very trigger happy.The plot itself is simply but Woo does not treat the audience like idiots. It is simply a tough cop going by his own rules and sets out to bring down a Triad boss any way possible. Chow Yun-Fat plays the role very well and his character is shown to be tough, ruthless cop who does have guilt about the lost of partner. He is also shown to have good with Teresa Mo as they sing pop songs together as they decode a message from a undercover police officer. The whole undercover police officer subplot who has to do violence acts reminded me of Infernal Affairs but it possibly because that film was also set in Hong Kong.Hard Boiled does suffers from some cop film clichés, particularly the police chief telling his rouge officer but this is a very well made, entertaining action film. This is a film that has a lot of John Woo's traits like slow-mo, reflections, gun-fu especially using two guns at once and playing soft music over a bloody action scene (a trick he used in Face\/Off).

Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas tells the story of Raoul Duke and his attorney, Dr Gonzo, on a mission to find the American Dream. The tale comes from two separate trips Hunter S Thompson made with his real - life attorney, Oscar Acosta in 1971. Raoul Duke is a pseudonym used frequently by Thompson in his books, and a character supposed to represent Thompson himself.The film has a very loose narrative structure and is effectively a two hour binge of drunken, drug fuelled madness that is very funny and both very well directed and acted out.

There can only be one of their kind, and every so often there is a gathering when only a few are left. They win the Prize. The Prize is knowing everything and having powers. Kind of like the prize in the last Indiana Jones movie, except that prize killed Cate Blanchett.In the end, Macleod wins the prize by beating the Kurgan. We will never know why. Oh wait, we do know why - he is the main character in the story. He is also good, and the Kurgan is bad.ENDI know I am going to get a lot of flack for this - but I watched Highlander again last night for the first time in almost 20 years. 20 years ago I was a child, and I loved this movie. I watched it repeatedly. I think I even loved the second one, but I did not know what was going on. All I saw then were swords, be-headings, and a Queen dabbled soundtrack. That was perhaps all that mattered back then. There is also something appealing about Christopher Lambert's voice.Anyway, the only reason I finished Highlander last night was because of how dated and bad it was.Sean Connery plays a character who was working from Spain, but is from Egypt. YET HE TALKS IN HIS Scottish ACCENT. His name is Juan Sanchez, by the way.In the scene in which Sean Connery's Juan dies, it seemed that Heather (Macleod's girlfriend) was there just to scream the entire time. She had SO MANY chances to leave. Even in a panic, any person would have left - For crying out loud, the BUILDING was falling down as Juan and the Kurgan were fighting. It was frustrating to watch (and hear) throughout the entire scene. Later, the viewer finds out that the Kurgan raped her afterward. Because of course he did.Anyway, Christopher Lambert changed his accent randomly throughout the movie. For example, the scene on boat with Sean Connery - the accent was almost mock Spaniard? Yet this was a serious scene in which he was yelling at Sean Connery, explaining to him to not rock the boat since he could not swim?Moving on, in a flashback scene to WWII, Macleod (Highlander) is dodging Nazis. These Nazis speak German. Macleod wittily retorts to them in English. It felt weird. Did the Nazi understand him? It appears that Lambert, in recent years, has been doing French movies. It is not like he could not do SOME TYPE OF OTHER LANGUAGE. (Granted, this is the director and writers' fault. A lot of things in this movie are their fault. But could have Lambert changed a few things? Could anyone else have tweaked a few things? Does a snowflake think its responsible in an avalanche? Rhetorical questions.)The love interest is played by Brenda Wyatt as Roxanne Hart. Roxanne works on the forensics team. She also CONVENIENTLY specializes in antique swords. This is how Russell Nash (Highlander's alter ego during this life) figures out that she works for the police and not for the Metropolitan Museum. He read this on her author biography on her History of Swords volume. This kind of ... convenient plot hole covering would never fly today. That is simply not believable - that a forensic detective is also an ancient sword expert.Most of the scenes between him and her come off as creepy.And in the end, how is Russell Nash able to even beat Kurgan for the Prize? Kurgan is supposed to be the strongest and most powerful, since he has killed the most immortals. WHAT USE IS IT TO HAVE THESE POWERS IF ONE OF THE YOUNGER IMMORTALS OF YOUR KIND IS ABLE TO BEAT YOU?! It just seems like a slap in the face. I would feel cheated if I were the Kurgan. I am sure he did.It is also never explained what these powers are, despite the fantastical show of getting these powers. I am referring to the powers associated with killing fellow immortals, not with the powers from the Prize.The movie left me with more questions than answers, and not in a philosophical wayWhy does the Kurgan still act barbaric even though that persona was five or more centuries ago?Why does the Kurgan quote Neil Young? (It is better to burn out than fade away?)Why did Kurt Cobain quote the Kurgan in his suicide note?Why was there a marine in the alley when the Kurgan was fighting that other immortal? Why was the marine carrying a machine gun? Are there not laws against this?Why does the the police detective banter with Nash about being gay in a derogatory manner? Quite randomly, at that.

Why is that a prize?How come not more immortals took the Kurgan route? Killing off more immortals before the time of the Gathering? I mean, might as well!

My goal in 2012 is to brave the task of watching all, many for the first time and commenting on each&#x85;all with an adult POV. Now, as soon as I can find an adult to do just that&#x85;)Ahhh&#x85; Number one. Snow WHITE and the seven little men. Like Walty Boy isn't trying to say something there. Don't count him out of adding subliminal messages throughout his works. And I'm not just talking about the Little Mermaid's Little Penis. I'm talking even smaller, as in using the phrase here Jiminy Cricket (repeatedly) or his hatred for things, well, not (snow) WHITE.Admittedly, I'm not the hugest fan of this animated film. Sure, it's groundbreaking, for 1937, and against all odds, they made the first (of thousands) of feature-length animated films. Keep in mind just because a movie's a milestone doesn't mean it equates greatness.Example? Episode IV, A New Hope, formally just plain Star Wars. Sure it was ahead of its time, light-years, in fact, but wasn't it a fraction of the movie, Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back, formally just plain Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back?Why was this, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, not the Great movie tons of critics attribute it to be? Oh, I don't know&#x85;because there's a lot of racism in here &#x96; from mocking the Chinese to the Native Americans? Because the lead singer (and voice) of Snow White sounds like she's sucking on chestnuts (not the dwarfs, I hope) whenever she opens her lips? Or is it the painful pacing?That last one got me. Sure, they wanted to make the first full feature length cartoon, but it still felt like a couple-of-minutes-long short stretched far too long in most scenes. It is said, in the truthful, and masterful sometimes Walt Disney-HIMSELF!, commentary on the DVD, that Walt wanted only scenes that enhanced the character development. Unfortunately, it still felt like scenes dragged longer than they should.I'll give it creativity. It's beautiful for what it was trying to be. It's also VERY adult. There's more than one scene of someone trying to kill someone else. Only, the Queen's evil plan was a little misconstrued. See, she sends her minion (apparently, she's just got one servant) to kill Snow White so the Queen can retain the Fairest of them all status. But then, she spends a good portion of screen time to transform into an ugly hag in order to trick Snow White into eating an apple and fall asleep. Luckily the writers caught the obvious flaw of a cure, but not the fact that there were plenty of opportunities for the witch\/queen to simply stab the beauty instead of just putting her to sleep.More things that irate me Grumpy, apparently one of the main characters &#x96; due to a higher amount of screen time than many of the other Smurfs in the movie, is a dick. Plain and simple. Sure, he evolves and Snow White spends a good portion of the movie attempting to get him to like her. But, he's still a nasty character in any lighting. Also, the extremely over-dramatic Snow White is no princess&#x85;she never, EVER, shows appreciation for any of the nice things anyone does for her. I.E. the animals bend over backwards to find her shelter. She never, ever offers or says thanks. The dwarfs care more about her than themselves in many occasions, such as places to sleep or when she eternally sleeps, and when she awakes, it's all about her wishes. Bitch.For die-hard Disney fans, it's a watch. It's not terrible; it's a good beginning and despite its flaws, I'm glad they (and the box office) had faith in Walty Boy to grant him further production deals, leading up to Disneyland, et al. Just don't be proclaiming it the masterpiece that people on the surface call it.Now&#x85;onto Pinocchio&#x85; ","genre":null},{"date":"3 January 2012","score":"0 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" (WARNING&#x85;This is the Adult Disney Review Series.

Oh, I don't know&#x85;because there's a lot of racism in here &#x96; from mocking the Chinese to the Native Americans? Because the lead singer (and voice) of Snow White sounds like she's sucking on chestnuts (not the dwarfs, I hope) whenever she opens her lips? Or is it the painful pacing?That last one got me. Sure, they wanted to make the first full feature length cartoon, but it still felt like a couple-of-minutes-long short stretched far too long in most scenes. It is said, in the truthful, and masterful sometimes Walt Disney-HIMSELF!, commentary on the DVD, that Walt wanted only scenes that enhanced the character development. Unfortunately, it still felt like scenes dragged longer than they should.I'll give it creativity. It's beautiful for what it was trying to be. It's also VERY adult. There's more than one scene of someone trying to kill someone else. Only, the Queen's evil plan was a little misconstrued. See, she sends her minion (apparently, she's just got one servant) to kill Snow White so the Queen can retain the Fairest of them all status. But then, she spends a good portion of screen time to transform into an ugly hag in order to trick Snow White into eating an apple and fall asleep. Luckily the writers caught the obvious flaw of a cure, but not the fact that there were plenty of opportunities for the witch\/queen to simply stab the beauty instead of just putting her to sleep.More things that irate me Grumpy, apparently one of the main characters &#x96; due to a higher amount of screen time than many of the other Smurfs in the movie, is a dick. Plain and simple. Sure, he evolves and Snow White spends a good portion of the movie attempting to get him to like her. But, he's still a nasty character in any lighting. Also, the extremely over-dramatic Snow White is no princess&#x85;she never, EVER, shows appreciation for any of the nice things anyone does for her. I.E. the animals bend over backwards to find her shelter. She never, ever offers or says thanks. The dwarfs care more about her than themselves in many occasions, such as places to sleep or when she eternally sleeps, and when she awakes, it's all about her wishes.

The film The Truman Show was among them. Around 2000 I watched The Truman Show several times, and tried to analyze its contents. Like many modern movies, it contains an ambiguous message. Obviously the leading theme is the obtrusive invasion of our private life by the producers of television programs. The common life of individual people is transformed into entertainment, not just in the form of a single commentary, but by means of regular (weekly or even daily) broadcastings. At the time this type of entertainment was still a novelty. I even remember that shortly after The Truman Show a similar film about the topic was released, titled EdTV. Since 2000 the so-called reality TV has become a common vehicle of entertainment, probably because it is cheap and doesn't require any careful considerations. Nevertheless The Truman Show has withstood the ravages of time, and still succeeds in fascinating me. At the time, I interpreted the story as a critique on the unwanted invasion of your private living space by unknown outsiders. For passer-bys clearly and intentionally block Burbanks passage, when he is in a hurry, both in a hospital, on the sidewalk, or in the file on the highway. During a chance meeting a cop unexpectedly happens to know his name. When Burbank wishes to visit the Fijis, the posters in the local traveling agency try to instil a fear for flying, and the flights to the Fijis happen to be fully booked for at least a month. Burbank discovers that in an eternal procession the same group of strangers circulates around his house. As a whole the chance of an accidental conjunction of circumstances becomes negligible, and Burbank logically concludes that it is all premeditated. The only surprise is his slowness in the uptake, considering that he had already been encysted for thirty years, since his birth. In the end Burbank succeeds in escaping from his artificial, repressing and hostile world. But now, after another ten years, I doubt that this is really the leading theme. For we live in a world, where you can simply watch the home life of your neighbors by infiltrating their computer through the net and controlling their web-cam by means of spy-ware. And if you can not do this, your government or an ICT firm certainly can. Apparently The Truman Show is not so much a protest against a threatening future Big Brother society (after the narration of the totalitarian society by George Orwell), as a warning against the actual way of living, that develops around us. Thus the story becomes a hotchpotch of undesirable developments for instance the intrusion of advertising in our lives. Or the social encysting and gossiping in the small community. Perhaps even the oppression by social conventions in general. Or the spying by the state and enterprises on their citizens and costumers, which in the professed age of terrorism has become unbounded.

Life of Brian, the third Monty Python film, follows the formula used with great success in the second, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, namely that of telling a story, loosely based upon historical fact or legend, though a series of sketches.The title character is Brian Cohen, a young Judean living during the first century AD. He joins the People's Front of Judea, a small group fighting to free the country from Roman occupation. After a series of misadventures, Brian is mistaken for the Messiah by a crowd of followers and ends up being crucified. Brian is frequently confused with Jesus Christ; the two men were both born in stables in Bethlehem on the same day, and the film opens with the Magi mistakenly coming to offer their homage to Brian, before realising their error.The film was hugely controversial when it came out in 1979, with numerous religious groups accusing the Pythons of irreverence; in a notorious television debate John Cleese and Michael Palin were forced to defend it against Malcolm Muggeridge and the Bishop of Southwark. These accusations had the predictable effect of increasing interest in the film, and thereby boosting cinema attendances, but they also highlighted a possible legal problem. Two years earlier, Britain's once-moribund blasphemy laws had been successfully revived by the anti-pornography campaigner Mary Whitehouse in a prosecution against the magazine Gay News. Fear of a similar prosecution meant that the Pythons had to be careful not to be seen attacking Christ himself; it is always made clear that Brian and Jesus are two separate people and that it is the hapless Brian who is being lampooned. The nearest the film comes to criticising Christian doctrine is during the Sermon on the Mount scene where Christ's words are misheard or misunderstood by his listeners. (Blessed are the cheesemakers Well, obviously it's not meant to be taken literally; it refers to any manufacturers of dairy products).Nevertheless, the film does contain a good deal of religious satire, aimed at those forms of organised religion which are intolerant of opposing viewpoints or refuse to permit critical scrutiny of their own dogmas. This is shown in the early scene where an elderly man is about to be stoned for blasphemy, having said that piece of fish was good enough for Jehovah, and more importantly in the scene where the crowd take Brian for the Messiah. This new religion only lasts for a short while, but during its brief existence it mimics some of the less admirable features of real-life religions, such as the tendency to split into competing, mutually hostile sects and the attribution of miraculous or mystical significance to the most mundane words and actions. The mob's faith is not shaken when Brian's divinity is denied not only by his own mother (He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy) but even by Brian himself. (Only the true Messiah denies his divinity!) There is also a good deal of political satire in the film, much of it of a surprisingly conservative nature. The famous What have the Romans ever done for us? sketch, for example, can be seen as a vindication of British and European colonialism. The political left is parodied by the People's Front of Judea. This tiny organisation, whose lack of significance is equalled only by the self-importance of its members, ostensibly exists to campaign against the Roman occupiers, but expends most of its energies in ideological squabbles against other revolutionary groupuscules such as the Popular Front of Judea and the Judean People's Front. Its bureaucratic mentality means that it is incapable of taking any action without extensive debate and the passing of several motions.Another target of the film's satire is Biblical epics like The Greatest Story Ever Told or Franco Zeffirelli's Jesus of Nazareth, which generally took a reverential attitude to religion. (Shooting in Tunisia, the Pythons reused some of the sets from Zeffirelli's film). The final crucifixion scene contains an obvious reference to Kubrick's Spartacus. (I'm Brian and so's my wife!) Cleese wanted to play Brian himself, but this role eventually went to Graham Chapman, leaving Cleese free to play his normal gallery of pompous authority-figures, including Reg, the leader of the PFJ, and the centurion who, after catching Brian painting the slogan Romans Go Home! in incorrect Latin (Romanes eunt domus) forces him to paint the grammatically correct version Romani ite domum 100 times. There are also memorable contributions from the other Pythons, including Terry Jones (who also directed) as Brian's shrewish mother Mandy, Eric Idle in his normal wisecracking Mr Cheeky personality and Palin as the camp, lisping Pontius Pilate (the little wascal has spiwit) and as the ineffectual public-schoolboy Roman officer Nisus Wettus. (Crucifixion? Out of the door, line on the left, one cross each). Idle's other great contribution to the film was to write the closing song Always Look on the Bright Side of Life, which has since taken on a life of its own, being played at football matches, weddings and funerals, including Chapman's.Life of Brian came out when I was a teenager, and as like most British teenagers of the period I was a huge Python fan I enjoyed it enormously. Since then I have watched it regularly, and every time I do I find something new to laugh at or some new subtlety I had not previously noticed.

If an overweight person is (seldom) portrayed in a movie (whether as a star or in a supporting role), he\/she will be either slow-witted, ill-tempered, clumsy, lazy, or some combination of all four. Most often, the overweight person will be there for one-dimensional comic relief. Eddie Murphy's character Sherman Klump in The Nutty Professor (hereafter Nutty) goes a long way to correct most, if not all, of the overweight movie stereotypes, and against those hostile odds present an admirable human being indeed.Actually, Sherman in Nutty is mainly an inimitable character with many positive qualities. He is a brilliant, mostly well-respected biologist capable of revolutionary discoveries. Sherman is cultured, polite, dignified, charismatic and gracious, even under the most trying circumstances. He lives in a respectable apartment. He has a loving, if outspoken, family. Actually, apart from his obesity (and the inevitable maladroitness that comes with it), Sherman's only real shortcoming is his shyness and lack of self-assertion, especially around women. Even so, when Sherman meets beautiful but demure Wellman College colleague Carla Purdy (Jada Pinkett-Smith), her demure demeanor somehow gives him the courage to ask her out on a date. Sherman's life seems complete. However, when Sherman and Carla attend a comedy show, and Sherman endures a withering (but funny) barrage of fat jokes by kamikaze comedian Reggie (Dave Chappelle), the hurt and humiliation compel Sherman into a fateful decision.Never one to whine about his lot, Sherman determinedly (and hilariously) has tried every conceivable regimen (diet, exercise, acupuncture) to lose the pounds. Eventually, he begins to make progress, but not quickly enough. However, the weight-reduction serum Sherman has been distilling and testing on hamsters will accelerate the process. So after the comedy club debacle, Sherman impulsively swigs some of the serum, which astoundingly transforms him into the svelte, dynamic Buddy Love (Eddie in real life, without the padding).Trouble is, Sherman\/Buddy may be more slender, but the serum somehow boosts his testosterone levels alarmingly so that the handsome stud also becomes insufferable, loud, and embarrassing. These qualities simultaneously attract and repel Carla and the audience. Buddy's abrasive manner isn't the only problem. It seems that the serum has only a temporary effect and tends to wear off at inopportune moments, such as when Buddy's transformation back to portly Sherman interrupts his date with Carla and eventually gets him wedged inside a Viper sports car. And so it progresses. With each Sherman\/Buddy change and reversion, the audience slowly learns that, counter to what Sherman initially believes, fewer and fewer people prefer Buddy. In fact, the subconscious impermanence of the serum indicates, to me anyway, that Sherman really, and correctly, prefers himself to Buddy.However, alter ego Buddy soon shows his selfish monstrousness. With his devious talk, his promiscuity, and his plotting, Buddy causes Sherman to lose just about everything good in his life - job, home, a social life. Worst of all, Sherman will lose his very identity if Buddy manages to take two timed gulps of his formula to remain Buddy forever. Like Jekyll fighting Hyde, Sherman literally has to get his life back. At an ornate gala where a pharmaceutical manufacturer Harlan Hartley (James Coburn) is expected to fund Sherman's college research, the fight does occur. After a titanic struggle, Sherman reclaims his body. Again, in a dignified heartfelt speech Sherman apologizes for the calamities, hurt, and chaos he has caused as Buddy and finally learns that you have to love and be comfortable with yourself. This candor impresses Harlan enough to make the grant, and charms Carla enough to accept a dance with Sherman.Funny thing about the fat jokes, comments, and slapstick throughout the movie - we laugh at them, but not at the person who endures them. Whether getting stuck in a chair or car, or erasing a blackboard with his belly, or getting chewed out by a venal, insulting, weaselly dean (Larry Miller) or struggling to walk up stairs or exercise, Sherman preserves his dignity and likability. We even wince a little, because such a nice, accomplished person should not have to put up with such misadventures. Through the laughter, we urge Sherman to find the courage, self-assertion, and self-love to get the happiness he deserves. Even his seemingly uncouth and raunchy family (most members played by the versatile Murphy himself) point him in that direction; they may be fat and flatulent and undisciplined, but they also love and accept themselves exactly as they are. In a distorted way, even Sherman's alter ego Buddy tries to urge Sherman forward. No matter what, you got to strut! And so Sherman ultimately does, because at heart, he was always a scholar and a gentleman.

Aside from those who have nostalgia for it, Secret of the Ooze is a dull venture the fight scenes are boring, the characters are uninteresting, and the story feels like only the bare bones of an actual script.The first TMNT movie was no masterpiece, but it was fun and sported good fight scenes, a dark atmosphere, and gave the characters actual personality. Secret of the Ooze has none of this. Due parents bewailing the violence in the first movie, the fight scenes are toned down considerably, now filled with slapstick that's both uninspired and ridiculous. The grittiness is eliminated altogether, yet the film never really has a light-hearted feel to it either, at least not in the same vein as the enjoyably goofy '87 cartoon. Everything, including the humor, just felt bland.But what really hurts the movie isn't the slapstick or goofiness it's the characters. The turtles have become stripped of their individual personalities; each one of them is the same goofy, catchphrase-spewing person (or turtle, if we're going to be technical). Splinter is given little to do, April is given nothing to do save for looking pretty, and Shredder proves to be less threatening than even his '87 counterpart. The new characters, Keno, and the mutant duo of Tokka and Rahzar, prove to be unexciting as well. Now, I was not expecting Shakespeare here, as it is a kids' film after all and one obviously made to milk money, but I at least wanted entertainment, no matter how mindless or contrived it might be. The problem is this isn't mindless entertainment it's just flat out boring.So, is there anything entertaining about this film? Well, Shredder's new costume is laughably bad. There's the infamous scene with Vanilla Ice doing his Ninja Rap. Keno pulls off some cool moves. And... yeah, that's it. Secret of the Ooze fits the description of meh it isn't enjoyable, it isn't terrible, and it most certainly isn't bad enough to be good.

I disagree, as it fits none of the criteria where are the horrible lines, the bad acting, the abundance of ham and cheese which makes many a bad movie hilarious? Aside from those who have nostalgia for it, Secret of the Ooze is a dull venture the fight scenes are boring, the characters are uninteresting, and the story feels like only the bare bones of an actual script.The first TMNT movie was no masterpiece, but it was fun and sported good fight scenes, a dark atmosphere, and gave the characters actual personality. Secret of the Ooze has none of this. Due parents bewailing the violence in the first movie, the fight scenes are toned down considerably, now filled with slapstick that's both uninspired and ridiculous. The grittiness is eliminated altogether, yet the film never really has a light-hearted feel to it either, at least not in the same vein as the enjoyably goofy '87 cartoon. Everything, including the humor, just felt bland.But what really hurts the movie isn't the slapstick or goofiness it's the characters. The turtles have become stripped of their individual personalities; each one of them is the same goofy, catchphrase-spewing person (or turtle, if we're going to be technical). Splinter is given little to do, April is given nothing to do save for looking pretty, and Shredder proves to be less threatening than even his '87 counterpart. The new characters, Keno, and the mutant duo of Tokka and Rahzar, prove to be unexciting as well. Now, I was not expecting Shakespeare here, as it is a kids' film after all and one obviously made to milk money, but I at least wanted entertainment, no matter how mindless or contrived it might be. The problem is this isn't mindless entertainment it's just flat out boring.So, is there anything entertaining about this film? Well, Shredder's new costume is laughably bad. There's the infamous scene with Vanilla Ice doing his Ninja Rap. Keno pulls off some cool moves. And... yeah, that's it. Secret of the Ooze fits the description of meh it isn't enjoyable, it isn't terrible, and it most certainly isn't bad enough to be good. It's just rushed, mediocre, and isn't likely to inspire repeat viewings.
