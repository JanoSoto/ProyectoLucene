I was in for a surprise, for this movies pales in comparison to the classic Animal House.  Now, I'm the type of person who goes into the theater with an open mind, ready to accept anything I see.  Honestly, I laughed, maybe, five times throughout this entire film.  The plot is far-fetched and extremely unrealistic, and the humor is nothing you haven't seen before.  The are a few reasons that this film should be at the very bottom of your movies-to-see listFirst, I know that when one goes into a movie such as this, they don't expect to be moved or emotionally touched.  But you do expect to laugh, and this movie doesn't produce.  The raunchy humor might cause some gross out laughs, but there is very little intellectual, thought-out humor involved. It runs along the same lines as American Pie, but is much more predictable and thoughtless.  Now, obviously, this film is targeted to college students and teens.  To prove my point, I must explain that I attend a Big Ten University and went to the movie with a sold-out crowd.  There were only a few laugh out loud and uproarious instances, which displays the obvious lack of humor(which is the entire goal of the film).Second, the storyline of the film is very flawed and predictable, especially the ending.  It is also extremely unrealistic, whereas I point to the fact that his father had no idea his son was still in school.  How would a father not be aware that he was spending $30,000 per year towards his son's tuition?  You'll notice how ludicrous this is if you see the film.  The only redeeming factor involved in this movie is the characters.  Van Wilder is played very well by Ryan Reynolds, and his Indian assistant offers almost all the laughs.In conclusion, this is a poorly written and developed film, offering marginal, if any, laughs.  Obviously, a film such as this strive to attain returns based upon humor and the ability to make audiences laugh.  This film, flat-out, did not accomplish that goal.  So, if this gross-out humor is what your looking for, take a look at Animal House or American Pie.  If you've already had the chance to see either of these movies, save your time, another one will undoubtedly be in theaters soon.

It's scary, it's creepy, and it's actually touching in parts.  So many reviewers had a low opinion of this film, and maybe it worked on me because I saw it in my home at 2am with the lights out.  And actually I thought the DVD feature where they tell you about the lives and deaths of the ghosts was thoroughly creepy.  In fact I had to put on NCAA basketball to get de-creeped.  I loved the makeup, it had a good story, good acting, good directing, a great house (as a major character), pretty good pacing, and neat special effects.  I really did like this movie and was expecting to just hate it.  The only thing that sneaks in to make it a little more like the formulaic horror movies of our day is the Rah Digga babysitter character, who interjects retarded lines like Man, I'm gonna die with 3 white people, I need a pay raise, and That's it, I can't take it anymore, I quit! when faced with the ghosts.  I don't think Rah Digga did a bad job, but I think her character was even sort of unnecessary.  Every function her character performed could have been achieved with some other character.  Like I said, she's not a bad actress and did what she could. But that character is the one major flaw in the movie.  She even steals away the last shot in the movie--don't worry, no spoiler--which should have been left for the more sentimental part of the movie.  I would have thought that would have been more satisfying than seeing her wandering around shouting. Other than that character, the rest of the movie was not only not as bad as I thought, but actually a real standout in the horror movies I've seen in the last few years.  I haven't seen one that really scared the crap out of me in quite a while either!  I think Thirteen Ghosts just really exceeds expectations on all levels.

Very few films have ever juggled so many filmmaking resources so well, but one of the few to do so, in my opinion, is the English clay-animated short The Wrong Trousers.As in Kane, Nick Park and his crew of animators expertly combine a variety of methods in telling their story.  The acting, or rather the character animation, is wonderful, more so for the dog Gromit than for the goofy-looking human Wallace; Gromit's subtle expressions conveying everything we need to know about what he's thinking.  Even more subtle is the penguin lodger, with a deliberately bland face but expressive gestures and body language.  The plot is ingenious, with hardly an ounce of fat, and perfectly paced, starting slowly and gaining momentum almost imperceptibly until the climax.The visual storytelling is excellent, especially since so much has to be conveyed without dialogue, and the clarity of the climactic sequence at the end marks a high point for film editing.  The staging includes dramatic lighting and other bits of visual texture with which few animators bother.  Finally, the music is one of Trousers's most overlooked features--the sequence in which Gromit leaves in the rain while the penguin watches from the window offers a neat demonstration of music's effectiveness as a storytelling tool.I don't really think The Wrong Trousers is really BETTER than Citizen Kane, in an artistic sense.  Of course, Orson Welles didn't try to make Kane as a 30-minute animated film with only three characters (two of whom are silent), either.

Sally Field said that they were forced to improvise a lot of their lines because they had no script. Reynolds said that Alfred Hitchock had the movie screened over and over. Reynolds said he spoke to Pat, the great director's daughter about this and she said Hitch loved the movie because he could see the people making it loved each other and that they were having the time of their lives.This film has its roots in the type of low-budget movies being made in the 1970's. With the success of films like Easy Rider, Bonnie and Clyde and Bullitt in the late 1960's, Hollywood was eager to make chase movies that featured anti-heroes. Characters that were either breaking the law or enforcing the law outside of established procedures but you still rooted for them anyway. Couple this with the popularity of CB radios and truck driving slang and you have movies like Vanishing Point, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, Convoy, Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry, Sugarland Express, Breaker, Breaker and this one. I still marvel at how I know practically every funny scene in the movie but I still laugh like I was a Colorado teenager all over again. Maybe I see some of the qualities Hitchcock saw in it.

Tora! Tora! is three parts boring history and one part action movie.  If the movie's only goal was to be a drama about the attack on Pearl Harbor then maybe they would be right, but this is primarily a documentary.  We see all the mistakes, from the seemed a good idea at the time to the truly monumental, that led up to the attack.  Reality doesn't conveniently fit our notions of plot and drama, but does let us see why events happened as they did.Matters aren't perfect, as I've heard the Japanese bombers were attacking from about 10,000 feet, not off the deck as portrayed, and some of the ship scenes are obviously models, but considering the film's effort to be factual it can be given a little leeway.Some scenes stick forever in my mind, such as Yamamoto's words at the end about what the attack may have accomplished, and somberly walking out on the deck of his massive battleship, knowing it will all be swept away in the battles to come.  That last scene was more powerful than all the action sequences before it, and I think playing Yamamoto was one of Toshiro Mifune's best roles.  This is also a film that probably couldn't be made today, for two reasons.  First is there simply aren't enough serviceable World War Two era aircraft to make the flying squadrons coming in for the attack.  (Yes, I know the Japanese planes were built from American trainers--but those trainers dated from about the same time period.) Today, as with the awful Pearl Harbor movie last summer, everything would be CGI effects.  But no matter how good the special effects are they can't really catch the feel of a real airplane doing the same thing.  It's amazing they were able to do this as late as 1970, and the closest movie I can think of for a similar effect of real aircraft flying in the scenes is The Blue Max.Secondly is the film makers of the time could make a historical movie and simply tell the story.  Today it seems the set designs are perfect and the special effects get louder and more explosive, but the key elements are warped.  Too often we get characters and plot points changed to fit conventional standards of political correctness or exaggerated ideas of how people were supposed to act and behave.  It's a real shame as movies like Tora are few and far between.  The only thing that could have made this one better is if Akira Kurosawa would have been able to direct the Japanese segments.

Many people seem to be of the opinion that computer generated animation is automatically 'better' than the hand drawn variety but I fail to see it.  How superficial has our society become when we claim to be satisfactorily entertained by a flimsy story rendered in a largely sterile style of animation?  Lost to us is the artistry and skill with which past greats like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was brought to us.  There are many reasons why this is not a particularly good film, yet all require one to think, so most people will fail to realise this and give it a good review; fair enough.  If you only want an entertaining pastime for 80 minutes or so, something to occupy the kids on a Sunday afternoon, then Ice Age will do the job better than many; at least it *is* suitable for kids (all too rare these days, even when intended for them) with little scatological humour and no jokes of a sexual nature. Look more critically at Ice Age though and several things are apparent.  The story, as I have said, is wafer thin, making the film rely too heavily on the character animation for its entertainment value.  These are fine but I couldn't help but feel that *all* the effort had gone into them; apart from the three main characters, all the others looked very plain and in many cases e.g. the fat sabre-toothed tiger and the small, particularly nasty, sabre-toothed tiger, actually seemed to have been designed by different hands.  This is a bad thing in any type of film, when the viewer senses that not everyone who was on board the project was pulling in the same direction.  The style of these animations wasn't in harmony with the leads.  Furthermore, none of them had any real depth; an attempt was made at this with Manfred, but it was way too little to generate the kind of sympathy audiences built up for characters in the great Disney features.  This means that Ice Age relies throughout, entirely, on the nuances of animation in what the characters do as opposed to what motivates them.  Luckily, what the characters do *is* entertaining - they are funny, look great, and say funny things with good sounding voices.  There are some great set pieces e.g. the ice slide sequence, and the genuinely dramatic lava flow, with some great sound effects. I was unhappy with the super-realistic water; judging from everything else in the film, the intent wasn't to make the film 'realistic' yet the water looked incredibly so.  This worked to draw the attention to how real the water looked and away from the film; yet it clearly couldn't have been rendered in any other way than by computer, so surely this undermines any real artistic talent that may have been on display elsewhere.  I wish more effort had been put into story and characterisation than in developing water-rendering computer software. As well as those characters that looked odd, the entire dodo sequence didn't seem to fit in with the film's look.Overall, Ice Age is a slick-appearing film with too much emphasis on the superficial, which, given the success of the overated Pixar films, is exactly what most people want.

I must admit that I enjoyed the movie a whole lot more this time, considering it was able to viewed in the cinema and that it was much better to watch. ET is a brilliant film and if you can not enjoy it,  than you have not got a movie-loving bone in your body.A group of alien botanists visit earth and one of them is lost and left behind stranded on this planet. A 10-year-old boy, Elliot, finds the alien. Soon the two begin to communicate, and start a different kind of friendship in which E.T learns about life on earth and Elliot learns about some new values for the true meaning of friendship. E.T. wants to go home, but if Elliot helps him, he'll lose a friend...The Story of this film is probably the main reason why I like it so much. ET is a friendly character, though the audience are not shown this  that until we get to meet him much later in the film. However once we do, the story really does take you on an emotional rollercoaster ride. In fact it is a sad teary movie. I love the way the audience is made to encourage ET and hope that whatever he wants to do, he gets the chance to do it. While in the long run he is able to make friends with some loving human beings. That is another side of the script I enjoyed, how the humans of the show interact with ET. It was well done and I can only commend the people behind the scenes, which include the script writer Melissa Mathison and the director, Steven Spielberg, who got it just right.The acting in this movie is famous, considering the stars that were in this film way back in 1982. Probably the most renowned  actor would have to be Drew Barrymore, who played Gertie. Boy, she was young in this movie, but she proved how talented she was going to be, and has gone on to do some wonderful work. Movies such as The Wedding Singer, Charlie's Angels, Poison Ivy and the film based on the Steven King novel, Firestarter. I like what Barrymore does onscreen, however I was sadden to see that her off-screen life has taken a turn for the worse, considering her house burnt down and her marriage to fellow actor Tom Green also failed in the last 12 months or so.   Yet there were other cast members that had a much heavier effect in this film. The main star would have to be Henry Thomas, who played Elliot. His role I feel would have made audiences very emotional, as Elliot is a caring character, who is also brave and would do anything for his Alien counterpart. I rate his performance in this film alongside current young star Haley Joel Osment, as the two have the similar style to each other. Then you have the role of older brother Michael, played by Robert MacNaughton, he was great as the smart-alec older brother, however as the circumstances start to become more serious, he becomes a responsible person in the tricky situation. For a 1982 film, ET had some extra-ordinary special effects, and to think that if it was done today, the movie would be all the better. I love all the scenes involving ET in some magical sense, with the bike flying scenes my favourite. There are also some very funny and touching scenes. Other scenes I loved were when Gertie takes ET and teaches him too talk and dresses him up in girlie clothes.  Throw in a bit of good acting from some young people and you have a very healthy film I say. So all in all ET is a great film, with a top cast, good special effects and a story that can only be loved by audiences around the world. I agree with Roger Ebert that ET is the reason why we watch movies, to reflect and too make us feel good about ourselves. I believe this film would have had the same cinema hype that movies like Star Wars, Ghostbusters and the Gremlins would have had.

However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.I feel that much of Gumps' appeal is his downright sense of doing the right thing regardless of the people and situations around him and we see that in this film. That being the case maybe we all wish we could be just a little more like that, trying to maintain innate goodness and not the trade-offs we often make as we go down lifes highways.The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrest's character terms it very well with this quote,I think it is a little bit of both. From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way.

END SPOILER From there the movie just seemed unbelievable, but at the same time, amazingly watchable (not unlike a horror movie).My problems with this movie are many. First, if you are going to try and tailor a movie to a female audience, why bring Fincher on board as the director? It doesn't make sense, because he is going to try to make the film dark and draw soon-to-be-disappointed males (like myself) into see the movie. It doesn't make sense, and while I brought the great one up, anyone else see his Alien3 disaster? He needs a great script to shine, and this failed to have that.Back to the target audience, if the movie is tailored to women, why have Jodie Foster run around with her breasts hanging halfway out her shirt for the first-half of the movie? I'm a guy, and would usually applaud such blatant T&A, but it's JODIE FOSTER, and I was looking for a plot, not her cleavage. Once the movie was over, the first thing I said to the two women I went with was, Jodie Foster's breasts should have had top billing, because they were the only thing going for the first half of the movie.On to the missing plot, I cannot believe you can rehash bits and pieces of different movies and expect it to work. Everything just seemed thrown together and then you have to suspend reality more times than should be expected. SPOILER Hey look, Jodie was ten inches from the fire and didn't get burned, but Jared Leto did. C'mon, let a three-year old watch that part, and tell me if he believes that could happen. It's just stupid. That coupled with country music's hardest head, and now you've gone to far-fetched. END SPOILER Also, the fact that I went in thinking that the idea of a Panic Room seemed utterly stupid, and left feeling that the plot-device actually did NOT seem to hurt the film, means that Fincher should be congratulated on being able to sweep over the idea either quite well, or quick enough to not let the audience really think about it.The actors all seemed to be acting in there own movies. Foster ran around enough that it was hard to tell how well she was acting. I think she was doing her best I Know What You Did Last Summer impression by running around like mad and leaning over everything just to make sure you knew she was female. Leto played his part well, but unfortunately his character had the depth of a mud-puddle. Forest Whitaker brought his every other movie role to this, and just seemed TOO nice from the VERY beginning. Note It is nice to have the character progress over the movie, instead of keeping him the same. Dwight Yoakam brought some much needed life to the movie, and progressed into what you figured he would be, but how hard is it to act in a ski-mask though? The girl played her part well, and was very realistic in most every scene. She shouldn't have ran circles around some of the other, more decorated actors the way she did.If you must-see this movie, you will be fairly impressed with the cinematography, some of the acting and occasionally the direction. If you are a guy, you will probably find the plot too sweet and the action not up to par. If you are an avid film watcher, like myself, you will find most of the ideas have been recycled and that the acting and writing are not as good as they should be.

I have watched this film so many times that I have lost count and still, new sh** comes to light every time I see it.You've seen it once, now why don't you give it a second chance?  If you do watch this film for the second time and enjoy it more than the first, you can contact me to express your opinions.  Even contact me if you still believe that it is poor and I will eat my hat! ","genre":"Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"8 April 2002","score":"","review":"  Of my top 10 movies, Se7en counts for 1 through 5. Fantastic dialogue, superb acting (OK Gwyneth but I've seen her do worse). The whole thing is totally believable (with the one exception of the 'keep out' tape on the inside) and let's face it most real life endings are not happy.I have seen this movie over 50 times and I cannot think of many movies I have seen more than twice (Pulp fiction, Fight Club, Mulholland Drive, The Producers, Matrix, Bladerunner).I have sympathy for John Doe's point of view as I am sure does Somerset.Kevin Spacey is amazing, this breaks in his voice during the car monologue shows real psychotic emotion and the framing of the scene by Fincher is simplistic genius.Pitt's acting at the end is truly gut wrenching and the subliminal flash is a clever touch used by Fincher again in Fight Club.Watch this movie again and study it for the classic it is.

Frankly, I avoided seeing it for a long time, but now am glad I did.  To complain that the film fails as a realistic portrayal of addiction is, I think, to miss the point.  Far from being the mere depiction of a collective downward spiral fueled by drugs, the movie is in fact a meditation on loneliness, greed, corruption, desperation, and the pervasiveness\/banality of media, among many other things.The subtleties of the text are communicated, first and foremost, by superb acting.  The performances of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are all revelatory.  In particular, I was knocked out by Burstyn, who is almost comically pathetic in the beginning, but who manages by the end to convey her character's utter devastation in the truest, most heartbreaking manner imaginable.  The others are absolutely perfect as well; I was simply astonished by Leto and especially Wayans (may he eschew scary movies forevermore).  Connelly has perhaps the most difficult role in the film, with opportunity and motivation galore to go over the top, and she delivers not a single false note throughout.My only real quibbles with the movie have to do with certain instances of the split-screen and jump-cut techniques, which struck me as somewhat gimmicky and repetitious, respectively.  That being said, overall the style of the film is impressive and appropriate.   The cinematography is beautifully conceived and executed, and the score is every bit as haunting as the performances (thanks largely to the work of the Kronos Quartet).In sum, regardless of whether or not the subject matter itself shocks you, this movie will put the viewer through the proverbial wringer.  Give it a chance, and you will connect with the characters and then witness their destruction (spiritual and otherwise).  It is a punishing but unforgettable experience.  I'm not sure whether I'd necessarily recommend it or not; it all depends on your personal tolerance level with regard to an unflinching portrayal of human nature and behavior at their most extreme and, ultimately, tragic.  For my part, while I don't expect to watch this film very often in the future, I'm sure glad it'll be on the shelf.
