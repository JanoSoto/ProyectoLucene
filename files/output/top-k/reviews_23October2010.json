[{"date":"23 October 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Shrek tries to take apart every cliché that Disney and other animated pictures have build upon. And for the most part it works that way. Unfortunately they do not stay true to that formula, heading back and using those same clichés as the story moves along. But on the other hand, does it make this a bad movie? Of course not. And you would have to a very bitter cynic to not like it at all I guess. Or not like animated movies in the first place. Taste is different, so maybe there are other reasons too. I can only tell you, that the voice talent on hand, the animation and the story as it is, are really good. I don't like to refer to Pixar, because it is unfair to every other animated picture ... but again this does not mean I didn't enjoy it. It's a fun little picture for the whole family ","genre":null},{"date":"23 October 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Shrek tries to take apart every cliché that Disney and other animated pictures have build upon.
