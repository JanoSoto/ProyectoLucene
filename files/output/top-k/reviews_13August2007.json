They want their movies fast, loud, tightly edited and a storyline so complicated and tangled up, it just might strangle you. This is evident from this year's block-busters such as Spiderman 3, At World's End, and Transformers, all of which display the traits stated above. I was growing sick of it, so in this time I headed off Video Ezy to rent out (which I ended up buying for $13) 2001 A Space Odyssey. This movie is most definitely slow, requires patience and tops the above movies by far, despite being released 39 years ago. Although 2001 is regarded a great sci-fi movie and pops up around the middle of many Top 100 list of movies, it was first received as too slow as well as too incomprehensible. This is exactly what the writers and director wanted the audience to feel and knowing the audience's reception, it was a daring move to make the movie like they did.To give you an idea of how slow the movie is, the first 25 minutes of the film and the last 23 minutes of the film contain no dialogue. This movie is not driven by story, it is done by beauty. Each shot is perfect, which is fitting given the director Stanley Kubrick was known as Hollywood's most perfectionist director (that is until I'll come in). Being the time-sets of this movie show us the past and future, but not the present, the audience is always being shown something unfamiliar, something that whilst the characters walk past casually, we admire the worlds we are being presented to. The waltz music also helps.The set design and special effects are more talented and more cleverer than those of today. You may be surprised to hear me say this, with CGI and digital shots used aplenty in sci-fi and action movies of today. But today, they are usually only used to make something seem realistic. In 2001, they are used to make something look beautiful or awe-inspiring. Also given that film-makers didn't have a great array of special effects at their hand back in pre-Star Wars 1968. Clever film-making and camera trick needed to be used to convince audiences a pen was floating or a man was running along a wall. These techniques are better than CGI any day. As for the psychodelic light journey near the end of the movie, it needs to be seen to be believed. Such amazing light spectacles makes the audience feel like they're in some sort of sicko Disney-Land ride.If you want some sort of storyline from 2001, then it comes sometime after the hour mark. Two spacemen, Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) are on their way to investigate Jupiter, whilst testing cryogenic sleeping. Their mission is guided by the super-computer HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain). HAL betrays the two space-men when they decide to unplug the super-computer. There's more, but I don't want to give too much away. It'd be better to watch this film without having a clue about the synopsis. Though I will talk about HAL. HAL is a polite, intelligent and possibly suave computer. He is supposedly reliable, but Dave and Frank soon find out the super-computer is not all he's cracked up to be. HAL is disturbingly human, much more so than Microsoft Sam. Though he may be able to betray, he has no conscience, does not fear consequence, which makes HAL one of the most interesting and most deadly and most parodied villains in cinema history (behind Darth Vader).2001 A Space Odyssey is a movie to be seen in a dark room at night, on the best TV available and be prepared to have your retina the time of its life (come the 2 hour mark of the film). 2001 is lavish with brilliant effects, flawless set pieces and designs and every shot is shot to perfection. Remember to be patient during this film. Space travel is tedious for the characters in this film, but to you hopefully is something much more marvellous. Don't expect everything to come together in the end, because it doesn't.

Mr. Jackson and company succeeded in the nearly impossible.As for the original, KING KONG(RKO Radio Pictures, 1933), it is no less a marvel and continues to attract new fans from succeeding generations. The changing trends and the 'march of time' surely have had their affects on today's viewer, but like any other basically good and substantial work, it remains above the 'dating' syndrome-the single, one-way ticket to scrap heap of the Camp crowd.And it's not as if we don't notice any differences in old films, as compared to any modern film. We no more look at a recently made movie and a Mack Sennett Keystone Kops comedy short in the same way, as we would view our Grandparents' Wedding Photos as being no different than our Sisters' Albums.In order to truly enjoy a vintage film, one must get into the proper frame of mind for a better frame of reference.Let's start of with the film and year. Okay, how 'bout oh, KING KONG (1933), how's that one? We give it a thorough scrutinizing, coming up with its basic pedigree. It's a Sound, Black & White, Feature Film of the Action\/Fantasy Drama.Our next task calls for taking a good look around the World of 1933 in order to understand the impact that a work of science fiction\/fantasy would have on a movie goer then. We must evaluate all circumstances.For example; in the film, the crew is going on an unknown length voyage from a wintry looking New York City to an uncharted tropical island. It turns out that the location of this 'Skull'Island is somewhere down around Borneo, Sumatra and Java-only more South toward the vast expanses of wide open Pacific. We must keep in mind the significance of the world's technological state at that moment in time.In today's World, it seems that just about everybody has a cellphone of their own. In the 1930's and even much later, such an invention surely was strictly Science Fiction, Buck Rogers stuff. In contrast to today, when even any Grade School Kid could phone Borneo. Well it was such a distance in those days, as it may as well have been Mars! The story of a giant creature, completely out of sync with our world is one that has deep roots; dating back to tales of Giants, Dragons and Ogres. Their influence can be found in the earliest days of the cinema. Cartoonist Windsor McKay's Animated Cartoon GERTIE THE DINOSAUR(1914)* is a fine example of the Monster Creature film lineage. THE LOST WORLD (First National,1925) could be considered as being directly ancestral to KONG. Having names like Willis O'Brien and Marcel Delgado, it was truly a cousin or sibling.There have been many essays and analytical pieces written about K.K. over the years. We can recall an essay in an English 101 Class we(I) took at The City College of Chicago, Woodrow Wilson Branch. The year was 1964, the essay entitled, What ever happened to King Kong?, and the author offered some theories about why the films'popularity had't waned over the years. Among them as to why it was very popular in the Black Community was that it portrayed a huge dark, human-like character smashing the buildings, the commercial districts, the hotels and even the transit system of White Society in New York. He also included the destruction of Policemen. Well, he has his rights to express opinions, no matter how wrong; we have a modest theory of our own.Kong is an uncontrolled, super powerful, example of the Natural World. It's potential for use to man and possessing the key to untold wealth, make it something that all in Our World would covet. Inspite of Man's puny power and poor judgment, he tries to possess and control same. And like the Genie of the Bottle (or say, Nuclear Power) anything can be destructive to us when improperly loosed on the World. And then, what to do to control same? * There was also a J.R.

Musical Score by Max Steiner. RKO Radio Pictures(1933). First of all, let's begin by thanking Peter Jackson for the big, blockbuster Homage to the original 1933 KING KONG. Usually, when someone makes or attempts to make a new version of an old film, we view them with a certain level of skepticism. When the film to be made is a Gem, a Mastepiece or a One of a Kind Genre-starter.Yes, in spite of this writer's doubts and unnecessary pre-release tirades about the then unseen final theatrical release. Mr. Jackson and company succeeded in the nearly impossible.As for the original, KING KONG(RKO Radio Pictures, 1933), it is no less a marvel and continues to attract new fans from succeeding generations. The changing trends and the 'march of time' surely have had their affects on today's viewer, but like any other basically good and substantial work, it remains above the 'dating' syndrome-the single, one-way ticket to scrap heap of the Camp crowd.And it's not as if we don't notice any differences in old films, as compared to any modern film. We no more look at a recently made movie and a Mack Sennett Keystone Kops comedy short in the same way, as we would view our Grandparents' Wedding Photos as being no different than our Sisters' Albums.In order to truly enjoy a vintage film, one must get into the proper frame of mind for a better frame of reference.Let's start of with the film and year. Okay, how 'bout oh, KING KONG (1933), how's that one? We give it a thorough scrutinizing, coming up with its basic pedigree. It's a Sound, Black & White, Feature Film of the Action\/Fantasy Drama.Our next task calls for taking a good look around the World of 1933 in order to understand the impact that a work of science fiction\/fantasy would have on a movie goer then. We must evaluate all circumstances.For example; in the film, the crew is going on an unknown length voyage from a wintry looking New York City to an uncharted tropical island. It turns out that the location of this 'Skull'Island is somewhere down around Borneo, Sumatra and Java-only more South toward the vast expanses of wide open Pacific. We must keep in mind the significance of the world's technological state at that moment in time.In today's World, it seems that just about everybody has a cellphone of their own. In the 1930's and even much later, such an invention surely was strictly Science Fiction, Buck Rogers stuff. In contrast to today, when even any Grade School Kid could phone Borneo. Well it was such a distance in those days, as it may as well have been Mars! The story of a giant creature, completely out of sync with our world is one that has deep roots; dating back to tales of Giants, Dragons and Ogres. Their influence can be found in the earliest days of the cinema. Cartoonist Windsor McKay's Animated Cartoon GERTIE THE DINOSAUR(1914)* is a fine example of the Monster Creature film lineage. THE LOST WORLD (First National,1925) could be considered as being directly ancestral to KONG. Having names like Willis O'Brien and Marcel Delgado, it was truly a cousin or sibling.There have been many essays and analytical pieces written about K.K. over the years.
