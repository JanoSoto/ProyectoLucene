[{"date":"16 September 2007","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Here is a film that is so uncomplicated and so brilliantly conceived compared to all other comedies that it is a must see. It is a comedy, but at the same time it is touching and meaningful and works in every way. It's a great example of a film that is done right. It just works. The film is about a kid named Max(Jason Schwartzman), a student who spends most of his time with his extracurricular activities and not enough time with his school work. He is an underachiever, and an enthusiastic one at that. He falls creepily in love with a teacher, Ms. Cross(Olivia Williams) who doesn't quite resent him, but definitely is taken aback by his stalker like presence. Max is friends with Mr. Blume(Bill Murray)who is a man that Max greatly admires, until he falls in love with Ms. Cross. Max decides to get revenge on Blume, and the two have a war consisting of cruel and unusual tricks and mind games. Add to this a young boy named Dirk(Mason Gamble)who wants revenge on Max for telling someone that he had a sexual encounter with his mom. This film is kind of like a French version of THE GRADUATE, mixed with darker humor and a faster pace. Jason Schwartzman does a fantastic job as Max, injecting a kind of arrogance and laid back presence that normally would be ignored in another film. Here, the character doesn't have the usual likable qualities that the same kind of character in another movie would have. Bill Murray also does an excellent job, despite his role not really being a integral as one would think. Right from the scene where his character is introduced, you can tell that this is a different kind of role for Murray. He is able to make the character more realistic by not having an ironic and silly persona and makes the character more human by showing that he has his limits. And Olivia Williams does a really cool job too. Her character doesn't have any sort of haunting qualities that you'd expect from her character and instead is just normal, depressed, and fairly smart woman who just so happens to have a man and a boy after her at the same time. I love the film because it doesn't have Hollywood conventions that people usually look for in a film. Instead, it has a tone and pace that betrays the usual things people are used to. It is a quirky and strange film. The soundtrack is filled with modern classic British tunes. The look of the film is extremely colorful. The film is full of dead pan energy. The intensity of the characters give it an edge that most films wouldn't dare toy around with. And as if it couldn't get any better, the film has one of the most touching endings I've seen to a film in modern years. You'd have to be crazy not to at least appreciate this one.

No power on earth could force me to reveal the ending, but maybe a hint will help childhood abuse.The abuse excuse is an interesting business in itself, far more interesting than the movie. What does childhood abuse mean? Do we mean sexual abuse? Physical? Both? How about whacking a kid over the back with a wooden cooking spoon, hard enough to break it? That's what happened to me and my brother when we were kids, just as similar things happened to all the other errant boys in the neighborhood. Sexual abuse? That never happened to any of us, as far as I know, although I'm not sure it would have been rejected with any degree of animation. In the Samoan village I studied for two years, there was one case of an adolescent boy found playing sexually with a much younger girl. The girl's family beat hell out of him. The boy's own family sent him to live with another branch of the family in another village, an exile that lasted two years. By the time he returned the incident was forgotten by everyone, including the child.

DeMornay's experience leading to her mental disorder can be called the social construction of trauma. It's not there unless we put it there. Enough of the psychiatric lecture.

Then, when she has her first tryst with Antonio Banderas, and Pio Donnagio's score is pounding the eroticism into our heads, the camera gives us a shot from over her shoulder of the bare-torsoed Antonio crawling over us with his hairy chest. Now THAT'S traumatic. It makes any male viewer feel as if he's on the floor of the laundry room at the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo. Don't get me wrong. I don't dislike Antonio Banderas. It's just that I'm not in love with him. There aren't enough nude shots of Rebecca DeMornay's elfin body in the entire universe to compensate for that kind of anxiety.Here's an engaging way of surviving this movie. Instead of just sitting there puling, try picking out the scenes that were filmed in Toronto and separating them from the ones shot in Budapest.

Maybe a doctor who is an expert on Lenny's affliction may find a few problems in that area, but otherwise the script is very tight, which is extremely RARE in (modern) thrillers.

Now we've got a third film to compare them to, the fifty years hence remake of 310 to Yuma.Both stories involve trains, fugitives and lawmen who are going to take their man out of town on that train, despite the presence of a small army of gunmen. Both echo High Noon, in that the lawmen have such odds against them that people keep urging them to quit. Both feature lengthy sequences where the lawmen and fugitives are holed up in hotel rooms, surrounded by the gunmen, with the whistle of the train in the distance.In Yuma, the lawman is a rancher, (the always excellent Van Heflin), who became part of a posse to deliver Glenn Ford to state prison only to see the rest of the posse die or quit, one by one, leaving him to do the job alone. He succeeds in doing it with the unexpected help of Ford, who has been needling him throughout the film but apparently became so impressed by Heflin's gritty integrity he decided to save his life and go with him, asserting that he's escaped from Yuma before and will again. The film eschews violence, with some gunplay at the beginning and end. It's all about the words and who is saying them. The cast is strong throughout, including Robert Emhart as the railroad boss and Henry Jones as the town drunk who sees this as a chance to redeem himself. The one drawback is that Ford, having played so many good guys, is never quite convincing as a bad guy. Somehow that causes the ending to make more sense than it otherwise would.In Yuma II, a large dose of violence, action and bloodshed has been added. When you see the 1957 film, you realize it wasn't really necessary, expect that that's what the modern audiences expect. If the Wade Gang really wants to save their man, would they turn the place into a shooting gallery? And would Wade run through it, seemingly voluntarily? And why would Wade blow away his own people, even if he had developed an admiration for Evans, the farmer? And why is Wade's second in command so loyal, citing all the things he's done for us, if Wade is the sort who would kill them all so remorselessly? It would make more sense if Wade had hidden the money from the robbery before they had a chance to split it and the gang wanted to rescue him to find out where he'd hid it. Then we know that Wade is not only going to escape form the train with the horse he summons, (while allowing the farmer's boy to regard his father as a hero), but he'd be getting away with the money, entirely in character.Again, the cast is great from the major roles to the smallest bits and it's their performances that really carry the film. I'll take Russell Crowe over Ford. Instead of just a cocky confidence, Crowe shows real charm and humor and dominates every scene he's in. Christian Bale is good as the dogged farmer, Evans, but Van Heflin is in a class by himself. I'll take the fetching Gretchen Moll over Leora Dana as the wife. You can see why Evans might be tempted by the idea of her in a nice dress. But Emhart and Jones are more interesting than the crew in Yuma II. Ben Foster's strange Charley Prince is much more memorable than Richard Jaeckel's 1957 version. Ultimately, the biggest difference between the films is the pace. Yuma II gallops along, afraid to stop too long for fear of boring the modern viewer. Yuma takes its time to tell its story, letting the tension build up. I ultimately decided I preferred is slightly over the newer version.But I still think that The Last Train from Gun Hill has both of them beat. It also has two top shelf lead actors squaring off. In this case it's Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn, (just a couple years after they appeared as Van Gogh and Gaughuin in a totally different film- and they are very good in both). I can't help wondering if this might have been intended to be another Douglas-Lancaster film since that pair had just done Gunfight at the OK Corral for John Sturges. This would have been an ideal follow-up but perhaps Burt couldn't see losing the final gun battle to Douglas, (even though he was willing to do the same thing in Verz Cruz to Gary Cooper).Just as Yuma has Frankie Laine singing the title tune, Gun Hill has a Dimitri Tiomkin score, (any self respecting 50's western had one or the other- or both). Yuma has a lot of shots of the New Mexico desert but Gun Hill has some beautiful big sky shots with men silhouetted against the sky- emphasizing the fact that their actions spring from their nature. In High Noon and the Yumas, there is a strong theme of the desire for self preservation vs. moral and community responsibility. Here there is some discussion of that in Douglas' conversation with the local lawman and with Quinn himself. But it's clear that the drama here springs from the nature of the men.Again, the casting of every role is perfect, especially the delicious Carolyn Jones, (why wasn't she a much bigger star?) And the ending is far more dramatic and action filled than Yuma without resorting to all the bloodshed of Yuma II.

Now we've got a third film to compare them to, the fifty years hence remake of 310 to Yuma.Both stories involve trains, fugitives and lawmen who are going to take their man out of town on that train, despite the presence of a small army of gunmen. Both echo High Noon, in that the lawmen have such odds against them that people keep urging them to quit. Both feature lengthy sequences where the lawmen and fugitives are holed up in hotel rooms, surrounded by the gunmen, with the whistle of the train in the distance.In Yuma, the lawman is a rancher, (the always excellent Van Heflin), who became part of a posse to deliver Glenn Ford to state prison only to see the rest of the posse die or quit, one by one, leaving him to do the job alone. He succeeds in doing it with the unexpected help of Ford, who has been needling him throughout the film but apparently became so impressed by Heflin's gritty integrity he decided to save his life and go with him, asserting that he's escaped from Yuma before and will again. The film eschews violence, with some gunplay at the beginning and end. It's all about the words and who is saying them. The cast is strong throughout, including Robert Emhart as the railroad boss and Henry Jones as the town drunk who sees this as a chance to redeem himself. The one drawback is that Ford, having played so many good guys, is never quite convincing as a bad guy. Somehow that causes the ending to make more sense than it otherwise would.In Yuma II, a large dose of violence, action and bloodshed has been added. When you see the 1957 film, you realize it wasn't really necessary, expect that that's what the modern audiences expect. If the Wade Gang really wants to save their man, would they turn the place into a shooting gallery? And would Wade run through it, seemingly voluntarily? And why would Wade blow away his own people, even if he had developed an admiration for Evans, the farmer? And why is Wade's second in command so loyal, citing all the things he's done for us, if Wade is the sort who would kill them all so remorselessly? It would make more sense if Wade had hidden the money from the robbery before they had a chance to split it and the gang wanted to rescue him to find out where he'd hid it. Then we know that Wade is not only going to escape form the train with the horse he summons, (while allowing the farmer's boy to regard his father as a hero), but he'd be getting away with the money, entirely in character.Again, the cast is great from the major roles to the smallest bits and it's their performances that really carry the film. I'll take Russell Crowe over Ford. Instead of just a cocky confidence, Crowe shows real charm and humor and dominates every scene he's in. Christian Bale is good as the dogged farmer, Evans, but Van Heflin is in a class by himself. I'll take the fetching Gretchen Moll over Leora Dana as the wife. You can see why Evans might be tempted by the idea of her in a nice dress. But Emhart and Jones are more interesting than the crew in Yuma II.

I had not realized how true it was until I first saw THE SOUND OF MUSIC, seemingly the most appreciated musical ever made, the action of which is set in Salzburg, Austria in the last happy days of the 1930s.Most probably, it is meaningless to present the content of the movie since a lot has been said about it by other reviewers. I'd rather focus on something that requires more analysis and I apologize if it seems too subjective for you. Yet, I feel an undeniable need to share those thoughts with people who read my comment. I'd like to discuss the powerful message of THE SOUND OF MUSIC. This movie, being loved but also despised by various viewers, is not as easy as its story. Perhaps a fairy tale good to be seen on Sunday afternoon with a family, but perhaps a thought provoking film that, besides all its colorful message conveys a profound message that addresses both human heart and human mind. After all, the movie does not have friends only but raises contradictory reactions too. Why?THE SOUND OF MUSIC constitutes a sort of catharsis. Everyone who feels lost in materialism of today's lifestyle, in vanity of today's consumption and in brutality of today's rat race faces another world here similarly to Von Trapp's family when Maria enters their home. Like her entrance supplied the whole family with forgotten music, the film supplies a viewer with forgotten treasures of humanity simplicity, pure love, joy, respect for nature and, most importantly, admiration of music... the treasures which are not so unavailable and vague but which lie hidden deep within one's heart. Robert Wise did a terrific job showing a combination of sweetness and profoundity, of humor and sentimentality. Consider, for instance, very gentle love scenes of Maria and Captain Von Trapp. As a result, this film is purely a movie of childlike hearts and sublime emotions compared to a blissful moment of spiritual climax. One of the song says (...) A dream that will need all the love you can give, everyday of your life for as long as you live. How can you ignore that profoundity as a viewer? Isn't that a short definition of what greatness is all about?As for the cast, the performances are very good, especially from the seven children and Julie Andrews who portrays her character with vitality and enthusiasm. A lovely sequence in the picturesque landscape when she teaches the children the notes will long remain in your memory. Christopher Plummer has a more difficult role of Captain Von Trapp who is reluctant to the new governess and her methods at first but, in the long run, gets through a sort of rebirth and the rise of true Love. This rebirth is caused by facing pure joy that leads him to admiration and cleans him within. The moment they sing Edelweiss on the stage is absolutely sublime and Plummer does the top job as someone who deeply desires to express the love and compassion for his nation. I also liked Peggy Wood as Mother Abbess who constitutes a very positive image of a nun giving profound wise advice.As for other artistic features, the film has a wonderful cinematography with absolutely stunning pictures filmed in the picturesque landscape of Austria.

Yet, it is important not to put this aspect as the key one when analyzing the film since THE SOUND OF MUSIC cannot be limited into a nice picture, melodious songs, fine moments and adorable faces of children only. It is much more...THE SOUND OF MUSIC is an oasis of human treasures for today's viewers, its charm will bloom and grow as long as there are people who can notice a wonder in the simplicity and sublimity of a child's smiling face.

It was one of those It films I just had to watch when I was younger, but upon viewing this 80s cult hit through adult eyes, I can't help but backlash against its more latent subtexts, some of which are just plain offensive.

But two people are trying to stop Jake from succeeding his evil sister, Catherine, the cruelest girl in school, and Priscilla, the bitchy cheerleader.So, I think, if I'm not mistaken, this movie are written by two of the six writers from Scary Movie, which had become a successful franchise. This is similar to another two writers from Scary Movie to write Date Movie and Epic Movie. Well, we all know taking only two writers of a successful franchise isn't enough to make a funny movie.Although being R rated, this film acts like a PG-13 teen movie. The sex and crude jokes are still in here. The fart jokes and toilet humor is still in here. The only thing different is that it's not funny. Most of them aren't funny.So many jokes in here falls flat while some might give you a chuckle. The reason some jokes won't work was that they were already used in Scary Movie (sad, isn't it?). Another reason is that some jokes have already been used in other famous comedies (like Airplane!).The only jokes that will give you laughs is the fact that this movie spoofs teen movies, trying to make it obvious the use of clichés used in these movies, which I like. I actually like it a lot, and I wanted a lot of those in the movie.

The last 30 minutes of the movie is trying to be like the movie that they are trying to spoof, meaning it's trying to be like another romantic teen comedy, starting from losing the girl, and ending with a happily ever after ending.There's nothing new here, except the blasting of the use of clichés used in other movies.

Starring Freddie Prinze, Jr., and the inimitable Tori Spelling, The House of Yes didn't give me great expectations, but for Parker Posey I was willing to take the risk. It turned out to be perhaps the most original comedy I've ever seen and one of my new favorite films. Naive reviewers and low ratings here on IMDb have confirmed my suspicion that most people completely miss the point of this film. There is nothing earnest or straightforward in the least about the story or the dialog. Writer Wendy McLeod and director Mark Waters are trying to do for film and theater (certain genres of them, at least) what A Mighty Wind did for folk music, or Best in Show did for dog shows. Although, I contend that The House of Yes accomplishes this parody in a vastly more ruthless and consistently incisive way than Christopher Guest could ever dream.The entire film is poking fun at all things trite, melodramatic, and self-serious about modern film and theater. From the narrative, the characters, and the setting, to the direction, cinematography, and dialog (especially the dialog), The House of Yes is not a film but a caricature of a film, adapted from a play that is the caricature of a play. Anyone who has read or seen a few modern plays will recognize the stilted, stylized dialog and the actors' artificial, super-sincere interpretations. Wendy McLeod is no idiot; she has a post-graduate degree in theater from Yale. She's not writing this doggerel in earnest; she's making fun of other people's doggerel. I mean, c'mon.In less skillful hands, this film could easily have slipped into the realm of burlesque. If, for the sake of humor, you want to point out lots of annoying, hackneyed film and theater conventions, you run the risk of making an especially annoying film. But I think, for the most part, McLeod and Waters dodged this bullet. Not every line in the film hits the perfect chord, but a surprising majority of them do.The House of Yes is not typical as a dark comedy, as a cult film, or as any other film genre.

Could the president's bully of a son (Tate Donovan) have killed her? Or are there more sinister forces at work here? For better or worse, the identity of the killer is made plain just past the halfway mark. But that doesn't mean you can't go along for the ride as shadowy assassins try to keep Snipes, as a D.C. detective, and Diane Lane, as a sympathetic Secret Service agent, from uncovering the truth. Snipes is in tip top shape here and is surrounded by several great character actors Ronny Cox as the president, Harris Yulin as a hawkish general and Alan Alda as a presidential adviser. Daniel Benzali, who some of you might remember from a short-lived TV crime show some years ago, is on hand as a senior Secret Service agent and Dennis Miller has a small role as a fellow D.C. detective. While MURDER AT 1600 is not a first-rate action film -- for one thing, it is chock full of tired plot devices -- it is certainly watchable. And it beats anything Snipes has done since going STV.

For better or worse, the identity of the killer is made plain just past the halfway mark. But that doesn't mean you can't go along for the ride as shadowy assassins try to keep Snipes, as a D.C. detective, and Diane Lane, as a sympathetic Secret Service agent, from uncovering the truth. Snipes is in tip top shape here and is surrounded by several great character actors Ronny Cox as the president, Harris Yulin as a hawkish general and Alan Alda as a presidential adviser. Daniel Benzali, who some of you might remember from a short-lived TV crime show some years ago, is on hand as a senior Secret Service agent and Dennis Miller has a small role as a fellow D.C. detective. While MURDER AT 1600 is not a first-rate action film -- for one thing, it is chock full of tired plot devices -- it is certainly watchable. And it beats anything Snipes has done since going STV.

I was eleven years do when The Brady's went off the air. I was too young to know just how funny the show really was. The Brady Bunch Movie is by far the best theatrical remake\/parody of a 1970's TV ever made. First, there's the brilliant idea to set the film in contemporary 1995 and allows the BRADY's to be the anachronism. A fact to which they're totally, wonderfully oblivious to. Everyone else lives for today, but the Brady's are still a quarter century out of sync. This allows for one of the great rules of comedy to work perfectly. The Rule There's nothing funnier that watching someone watch someone else lose their mind. John Clesse said that (or close to it) but it's so true. Watching the reactions everyone has to the Brady's and their 70s ways are side splitting. Possibly the funniest bit is the simplest. Cindy Brady strolls over to the next door neighbors to bring them some undelivered mail. She walks through her own backyard, a poorly lit indoor TV studio set complete with an Astoturf lawn that sports rather obvious seams where it's been stitched together. She then passes trough the hedges onto the neighbors property and she ACTUALLY IS outside for real! Subtle, but hilarious! To have done the film straight as if the TV series never ended would have been embarrassing. Here we have the best of both worlds. Casual fans can laugh at the razor sharp satire, and long time fans can enjoy the trip down memory lane and still enjoy the good natured satirical humor! The cast is amazing! I realize that they can do anything these days, but it still must have been difficult to find actors that not only resembled the originals, but that were enough off kilter enough to make the satire work. My favorite line comes near the start as Marsha is walking through the high school campus as she draws longing stares from just about every guy who lays eyes on her. One remarks That's Marsha Brady. She's harder to get into than a Pearl Jam concert!

Angela is in fine form playing a good-hearted apprentice witch in World War II England who helps defend her country against the invading Germans; her inherent persnickety charm is smoothed out here, and she's relaxed in a lower-key when its called for, even making some of the sugary songs tolerable.
