It is truly a love story with continual twists just waiting and hoping to catch up to one another. You can see the outcome of course that would be a horrible twist but love it more and more whenever I see it even without all the goofs thanks for putting them there it just makes it more real. Like 13 going on 30 another movie about fate turns it's head to the right direction the actors and actresses show life's events and if we don't listen to our hearts we can miss out on the most important things. When Sara and Jonathan both forget there items and come back to the coffee shop at the same time don't you hope that he says and expect that he will say the perfect words? It's like telling us to live for the moment and not to let those pass by saying what we feel at that exact time and moment.

What was an exceptional film, has been marginalized by two factors--the utter stupidity of DEATH WISH 2, 3, 4, etc. as well as the loud wailing of the ultra-left about how horrible and offensive this film is. One of the later DEATH WISH films shows that Bronson has given up using his trusty .357 Magnum and replaced it with a shoulder-launched rocket! Talk about making a film to appeal to the idiots out there! And as far as the ultra-left goes, I doubt that in many cases these people actually saw DEATH WISH before condemning it in a knee-jerk way just because it DID have guns and vigilantism.The film is an excellent portrait of an ordinary successful guy living with his family in the big city. One day, all this is interrupted when his wife is murdered and his daughter brutalized by a gang of scum. He's miserable and his life has been totally uprooted. Only later, when a business associate gives him a gun, does he consider looking for vengeance. And, I like how this was handled. He was NOT a jerk or crazy man--especially at first. Instead, he just carried the gun for protection. Trouble came to him--he wasn't initially seeking it. When he is mugged, he shoots back and is later horrified by his actions. But, as the movie continues, you see he then begins to deliberately walk the streets late at night in the hope that the thugs would attack. He never, by the way, solicited these attacks--they just occurred because he had the unmitigated gall to walk the streets after dark. So, he is technically a vigilante of sorts, but he was never a crazed killer and, quite frankly, I didn't shed too many tears when he shot these predators. The film exposed our breakdown in society in the 1970s without explicitly recommending we pack heat and blast away at the bad guys and in the process it really made me think.

I know there are always going to be goofs whether a movie is live-action or animated but Transformers has always had a shocking amount of them.I know that many people are going to hate for this and call me cynical but this is not really a movie. It's an 85 minute toy commercial. Orson Welles was right. Many of the Autobots and Decepticon's die (including Starscream, thank God, he truly was irritating) but are soon replaced by new characters. It's like Hasbro was subliminally telling kids to throw out the old toys and go buy new ones.Set in the unfathomably distant future of 2005, when we'll be living on the moon and skating around on hover-boards, the gobbledygook plot involves a giant planet-eating robot planet called Unicron (barely an anagram of a certain magical creature, for no reason) and his mission to destroy the 'Autobot Matrix of Leadership', which is obviously inside Optimus Prime. It begins with the Autobots and Decepticons doing their usual battle of blowing up each other's stuff but what is bugging is that in the show they rarely get hit and certainly never die if they do. But here loads of them are killed-off easily and without any particular attention. So many of them fall it's hard to keep up. The story moves so fast that it becomes almost completely incomprehensible.None of these new characters have the same appeal. Once Optimus Prime is dead the new leader, Ultra Magnus, doesn't yield his authority or leadership with any special flair. Megatron is left to die, while floating in the depths of space and is reconfigured\/evolved by Unicron into Galvatron, who doesn't seem to be any kind of eviler, just a new toy. The Matrix of Leadership happens to be a glowing ball in Optimus Prime's chest and when Ultra Magnus get his hands on it the movie could have become a 'chase for the bland MacGuffin' kind of story.

I'll say right off that I didn't find it all that wildly amusing &#150; it's perhaps too true to life for that. However, I did find it touching. In places.Judging from the comments I have seen so far, the rogue in the piece is Royal himself, who is seen to be selfish and somewhat uncaring as a father. Royal deserted his family and now look what's happened.I don't see it this way at all. I see Royal as the only refreshing person in the family and the only hope for their salvation. He left them because he got sick of them. They were all high-achievers, egged on by their high-achieving mother. Not surprisingly, they burned themselves out and are suffering the consequences of it, each in their own way. They have one thing in common &#150; none had a real childhood.Royal opted out of it. No doubt fed up with the pressures of being a high-achiever himself, he holed himself up in a hotel room with his encyclopedias and enjoyed the childhood which he had had stolen from him. Now he wants to give that childhood back to his family.However, he is too late &#150; they are too set in their ways. The only one who moves forward somewhat from his time-frozen state is Richie, but he can't cope with the consequences.

But after all the mayhem they manage to get up to in the mall, they just can't get their ex-girlfriends off their mind. So the two team up with the help of Jay and Silent Bob to come up with a plan to win them back. Though, they got the likes of T.S' girlfriend's dad and that of a scummy store manager to overcome before winning back their girls.Don't you just love the self-loathing, slacker generation! After the huge and promising success that was Clerks for director\/writer Kevin Smith. Obiviously there was pressure to repeat that winning formula with his follow up. Even though Mallrats is a more bigger and polished studio bound production of Clerks set in the mall, it just didn't take off at all. It came and went by with little interest. Maybe it doesn't hold that fundamentally cunning humour and smarting realism that made the low budget film Clerks originally quirky and fresh. I'm not a big fan of Smith's work, as I've only caught his first three flicks and I still think his third film Chasing Amy is the best. But this commercially mainstream project isn't all a failure, because the film still does come up with an entertaining tale of laid-back characters with a muster of jokes set-up in a mall. Definitely much more crass and juvenile are the gags this time and somewhat the humour tries to be funny than naturally being it. But what compensates it is that there was a continuous roll with one after another, so if one didn't work out there's another that would hopefully evoke a laugh. The film is actually made up of little episodes that happen throughout the day with something endlessly popping up and many characters deciding to make a scene. It's all over the place you can say. There are some memorably comical sequences like that of the Stan Lee cameo, the Easter bunny and that of the cheesy date game show. But there's one lewd segment involving chocolate pretzels, which will make you barf.What makes this quite fun is that of the lively performances of Jason Lee's self-absorbed Brodie and the always reliable pairing of Jay and Silent Bob. Also adding to the enjoyable mess are Shannon Doherty, Claire Forlani, Jeremy London, Joey Lauren Adams, Priscilla Barnes, Michael Rooker and a slimy performance by Ben Affleck. The spontaneous dialog is self-conscious with its referential gags and it's filled with a carefree attitude and pure nonsense amongst the stemming wisdom and frankness. Especially those facts considering that of the mall's customs and the respect it deserves. Heck! I should know, as I had a friend that persistently visited the mall everyday&#133; just to be there for the sake of it. Though, I thought it turned into moralistic babble in the dying stages. But these things don't take away from sarcastic interplay and skits that are generated throughout the running time, even though it really seems like an eccentric melodrama with humorous overtones at times. A nice bubblegum rock soundtrack crops up to mould itself within the context and the camera-work has a professional touch too. The best way to take it is to see it as good undemanding fun!Smith tried outdoing himself here, but sometimes it doesn't work and it seems more conventional than his other films, but that doesn't stop this from being alluringly amusing and satisfying when you comes to the ending credits.

ROPER So, now you give the Devil the benefit of law! MORE Yes! What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? ROPER Yes, I'd cut down every law in England to do that! MORE Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned 'round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to coast, Man's laws, not God's! And if you cut them down, and you're just the man to do it, do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake! This has been quoted widely in the blogosphere to describe the behavior of the current administration and the war on terror. Would the zealots among us cut down every law in the US to get at terror? I fear the counsel we would be given by this administration would be rather different from Sir Thomas' advice to his daughter's suitor. But more instructive advice comes to us from one of its villains, Cromwell. We are just the administrators, Cromwell tells Richard Rich, who is meeting with him secretly, desperately seeking a job. Cromwell enthralls young Rich, telling him that if the King wants to divorce his woman and marry another, it is up to the administrators to make it happen. Slowly, inevitably, Cromwell seduces Rich to betray Sir Thomas More, from whom Rich once received a gift. No matter what the King wants, Cromwell will make it legal. This sounds too familiar. Who could it remind us of today? No wonder people yearn for the quiet moral rectitude of Sir Thomas More. Rich is played by a young, handsome John Hurt; Cromwell by the durable actor who played The Common Man in the play, Leo McKern. Scofield, as More, brings admirable restraint to More's uncompromising loyalty to his principles of faith. The contrast to today's champions of people of faith is most instructive. It is about Rich, who More knows is about to betray him that More has the following dialog with Roper. MORE There's no law against that. ROPER There is! There's God's law. MORE Then let God arrest him. More was incorruptible. He would not invoke God's law over the human-made law he had sworn to uphold as Lord Chancellor, even to save his own neck.Rich goes on to betray More by misleading the court at More's trial for treason, a charge brought by Cromwell because More would not bless the King's marriage to Anne Boleyn. Like someone we know who went to Africa and came back with the wrong intelligence, More has to be gotten out of the way, discredited, or killed. Rich is just the man for the job. And his reward, he is made chief solicitor of Wales, a job for which he is too young, and clearly not yet qualified.When this film was released in 1966, the intelligence being cooked so the President could have his way was about Vietnam.

I don't know why some are criticizing this movie, I can't forget the first time I watch it on Theatre, it was an experience that I will never forget, the first time feeling is unbelievable, you can't describe how much feelings and emotions you have, &#133;just ..Perfect..

Whether it was in the early 40s like the film Gaslight or later like Lean's Great Expectations, I have never seen so many great stories with so much originality, humanity, and creativity. Impact is no different. What transformed this picture from your typical film-noir thriller into a full-fledged murder\/mystery is not just the creative story, but also the strong characters, the twisting themes, and the questionable ending. Impact could not have been as fascinating as it was if it were not for the impressive story. From the opening scene, we think that we have this film already pegged as your typical wife cheats on man and he now wants revenge story, but as director Arthur Lubin guides us further down his diabolical path, we learn that there is going to be more surprises than we originally anticipated. These surprises will not only lock your jaw in a shocked position, but it will also provide 111 minutes of pure uncut film-noir.I have read other reviews that claim that Impact does not fall within the typical film-noir genre. I see where they are saying this, but I do not agree. Lubin, I believe, was creating a classy film-noir for his audience, but he tricked us. He not only tricked us from the beginning of the film to the end, but also where the film-noir style should be placed. We assume that the because Brian Donlevy is our centralized character that he has to be the dark and brooding one the entire time, causing the sensation of film-noir. I saw this film in a different light. As Lubin kept Donlevy in the eye of the camera for most of the film, I thought that the true sinister, dark, brooding, spooky, and edgy character was Irene. Helen Walker did a superb job with this role. Not only did she portray the backstabbing wife with such precision and ease, but she also played this very strong character that I was not expecting. That sensation of film-noir with the themes of suspicion, anxiety, and pessimism are all collected well within Walker's portrayal of Irene. It is this character that fully embodies the idea of film-noir, and I couldn't keep my eyes off her the entire film. To see such a powerful female character in such an early age of Hollywood impressed me. I do not see why Impact has not made a bigger impression in the film communities. It is a landmark film that will keep you guessing in a better way than any Shyamalan film will.Even if you cannot agree with me about Lubin's slight of film-noir hands, it is unmistakably true that Impact contains some of the best story coupled with acting that we have seen in quite a long time. Even in today's Hollywood you just do not see this type of intensity, excitement, and curiosity as you found in Impact. I would not be surprised if we eventually saw a remake of this film in the future. It has all the elements that one would desire to be a box-office sensation; an evil wife, a passionate husband, and a dark secret. Who wouldn't love to see this? I personally could not keep my eyes off the story or the actors in this film. Brian Donlevy was beyond normal as the disarmed man facing the truth that his wife is no longer in love with him. This being my first Donlevy film, I cannot wait to see other pieces of his work. I think he was both strong and weak enough to carry the picture. He had to show that he still loved his wife, no matter what she did, and he pulled it off with so much dedication that I nearly wanted to stand up and clap for him in my living room. I have already spoken on Irene, who I believe matched Donlevy straw for straw. Lubin needed a character that was going to counter Donlevy's like-ability, and Helen Walker did just that. As audience members, we wanted to love her and hate her at the same time. Ella Raines was nothing spectacular, but did bring this light pro-feminism theme into this light film-noir thriller. Tony Barrett was the epitome of evil; never breaking character and always making me feel slimy. My personal favorite character was Lt. Tom Quincy. I have seen many parodies when they would use the southern flatfoot, but I had never seen a film that utilized this cliché character. Impact did it and Charles Coburn perfected it. As he attempted to solve the crime, he used the vice of kindness and dedication, making this critic smile with delight. He carried the truth of this film on his back without any struggle at all.Overall, I thought that Impact was yet another great film that I can attribute to the 1940s. I don't know who the brains were during this cinematic time, but I wish I could go back and shake their hands. Their imagination, ability to keep audiences guessing, as well as produce great B level actors giving more than 100% of their abilities to a film is nearly impossible to find today. I would have loved to live during this era and see these films in the smoky auditoriums packed with untouched minds. Impact was nearly flawless. I guess it dragged sometimes, and the ending seemed to be wrapped up a bit too quickly (again, the happy factor wasn't needed at the end), but this film kept my attention throughout. I cannot wait to show this movie to friends and family. To fully see where we get our ideas for our films in the year 2006, we must make sure that we respect the films from the 1940s. Impact should be at the top of every film enthusiast's list!

The plot shifts drastically about a third of the way in, but then gets actually better.The best parts of this movie are the father tracking down a killer, trying to stop him before he kills nurses (thus gaining himself the nickname the Nightingale Killer). Using facts from the crime after the fact, he is easily able to know where and when the killer will strike. The film then becomes an interesting detective story as well as a heart-warming family tale.

For people that love family films this is a movie for you. The movie is great for kids and adults. I think it's a must see. The reason why they remade it was because it was so good, the just wanted to make the movie even better by fixing the color. After watching this movie it makes you want to watch the sequel. Everyone will love this movie. It will be remembered for generations to come. I gave this movie a ten because most people can in some way relate to this story.

We needs things sorted out and tied off. We need closure.2001 is a very unconventional piece of storytelling, as much a work of abstract art as it is a narrative. The movie is about humans exploring the unknown -- and finding things that they cannot understand. And flying in the face of our desire for explanation, the movie explains very little. Instead, we experience events as the characters experience them awed, and utterly uncomprehending.I'd always loved this movie, but hadn't appreciated just how specular it is until I had a chance to see it on the big screen at the Heights Theater (a a lovely Twin Cities art house place with a working theater organ!). Then I realized you aren't *supposed* to understand what's going on -- not at the start, not at the end. You are supposed to be mystified and utterly overwhelmed. I don't mean overwhelmed by huge explosions or lots of lots of rumbling THX bass gimmicks; I mean overwhelmed by a sense that the universe is vast, and we humans are tiny and ignorant.I think people often don't like this masterful movie because they expect explanations, and are disappointed. If you're seeing it for the first time, expect to understand nothing. It's about the experience, not explanations. See it on a big screen if possible, and embrace the confusion!

Yes, it's mildly entertaining and might even bring a tear to your eye. When I first saw this movie shortly after its release, I was a young college student myself (sorry, I'm dating myself here) and absolutely adored it beyond words. But time passes...oh, to be young! I haven't seen it since, but suspect my current reaction would be quite dramatically different. I'm afraid I might snicker.To summarize, it's the tale of two college students who fall in love...a rich Harvard law student, Oliver Barrett IV (played by Ryan O'Neal) and a beautiful, rather sassy, dark haired Radcliff music major, Jenny Cavalleri (played by Ali McGraw), daughter of a working class Italian father. Naturally, as one would surely predict, the course of true love does not run smooth. Oliver's authoritarian father (Oliver Barrett III) disapproves of the romance and threatens to disinherit his son. No surprises there. Rich boy, poor girl...one would be shocked if the father DIDN'T threaten to disinherit.*** WARNING SPOILER AHEAD *** The pair bed (ooooh, how risqué) and eventually wed, though not in a church of course...heaven forbid such a traditional, religious ceremony. To the best of my recollection, though Jenny's Italian father is Catholic, these two don't believe in God. Oh dear me, no, having faith would never do. Alas, before too long there is trouble in paradise. Jenny is soon diagnosed with leukemia (I believe) or a fatal illness of some sort and quite dramatically dies, more or less in Oliver's arms and basically looking, I seem to recall, every bit as healthy and gorgeous as the day he met her. Mind you, the death scene was all very touching for me back in 1970. I wept for quite some years.That was THEN. As for NOW, I consider the tale pretty unoriginal at best and not particularly well done even, though both the novel (by Erich Segal) and movie as well as their sequel, Oliver's Story, were cult-like popular at the time. I succumbed like almost everyone else of my vintage.The famous line Love means never having to say you're sorry now seems, after I've enjoyed nearly a quarter century of happy marriage, downright idiotic. Please, I beg you, don't gather your marital advice from this film. A word to the wise, as another reviewer also noted ... Love means learning to say you're sorry quite frequently, and meaning it... that is, if you want a romantic relationship to endure. I'm afraid too many viewers may have taken Jenny's pearl of wisdom to heart and that's why our divorce courts are so full today. I've read some of the flattering reviews and am pleased for those of you who still like this movie; I don't begrudge you. But how many of you middle aged folk have actually watched it lately? Are you sure you're not just waxing nostalgic about your own youth and college years, recalling how much you loved it way back when? That was exactly what I was tempted to do myself; then I got to thinking... By all means, see Love Story and consider it sort of a period piece from the hippie era. There ARE worse ways to spend an hour and a half, but frankly, there are an awful lot of more moving romances out there, with more original plot lines and more engaging, sympathetic characters than this stereotypical pair. The only chemistry here is in the nearby university science buildings. Jenny seems downright rude and cocky to me now...sorry, fans, but I mightn't care much about her terminal illness any more; I don't even much like her; she's just not very nice... and Oliver (albeit he's quite handsome of course) is well, just a little dull.You must realize, I'm not spoofing this movie as much as I'm mocking my foolish, younger self. Sorry, Jenny and Oliver...I feel kind of guilty betraying you like this but I can't help it. I'm still a romantic, I'm not normally a cynic and still love a tearjerker, but I realize more now what true love is and what it isn't. I've grown up.
