The writing was poor, it wasn't at all true to the charachters created in the first movie (and I watched Silence right before going to see Hannibal).  Anthony Hopkins did his best with what he had, but this Hannibal Lecter was unbeleivable compared to what we know he can do. Also, I feel Hannibal Lecter himself would have been dissapointed with this movie. It was crass, unrefined, and he would have found it rude. There was none of the delicious subtlety we were hoping for, only bloody gore reminicent of a bad B-horror movie.  It was crude, and disgusting. Julianne Moore was a completely unbeleivable Starling, with none of the spunk Jodie Foster gave the character.  It was painful to watch her try to fill Oscar winning shoes, and to be honest she should not have tried.  The cinematography was poor, the lighting, the directing, etc. The only redeemable factor was the music... watch for the piece Anthony Hopkins composed.

What did people expect?  I think this film is way over the heads of a great many people posting on this board. Hannibal is an ironic love story about people existing and\/or coping with extraordinary circumstances.There are major spoilers in this commentary. Do not read on if you haven't seen the film.Dr. Lecter wants only to live a quiet life of academic study and introspection. He has no desire to kill. Except he finds himself stalked by three separate and differently motivated pursuers; insecure, middle-aged, Pazzi who seeks money to keep his beautiful young wife, Mason who seeks a vicious and bloody revenge and Starling who wishes to do her job and is also compelled to save yet another victim (Hannibal) from a terrible fate just as she wished to save Catherine Martin from Buffalo Bill and the spring lambs from a slaughter.  Given these circumstances Hannibal reacts according to his wiring. He protects himself with the same style and flair that he always has but with a significant difference he doesn't eat his victims. And he dispatches them cleaner and quicker. A quick cut to the groin for one. He takes longer with Pazzi because he needs to extract information from him. His threat to Pazzi about his wife is a bluff. He understands Pazzi's fear for his wife because he shares Pazzi's emotions. When he notices Pazzi and his wife at the opera, his smile is not malevolent but one of understanding. His murder of Paz is constructed to be theatrical and public because it's message, a warning to Mason or any one else who might pursue him. And as we find out later someone could have stopped him.         His next victim is dispatched expediently. Another is not killed but certainly altered forever. In fact Clarice kills more people in this film than Hannibal does. And his surgery on her tormenter is really a humiliation and is prompted by his outrage at Claice's victimization. What concerned lover wouldn't spring to defend his beloved? Again the dramatic nature of these actions is because Hannibal has been hardwired to be and do everything in an extraordinary way. That is his nature. That is why  we have all been fascinated by him for so long.Harris' novel while flawed, was also compelling and thought provoking. I thought that Zaillian's script and Scott's direction did an admirable job of condensing, compressing and reordering Harris' themes and scenes to construct a different resolution to the novels controversial ending. If you have not read the book, do so. Some of the references in the film were designed to be understood by readers of the book. The brief shot of a maroon eyed deer during her triage, for instance, as well as the specifically tantalizing décolleté of Clarice's evening gown. In his first appearance in the book, Hannibal has a conversation with Pazzi about a scar on his hand. In the books it is a major point that Lector has six fingers on his left hand. He has had it amputated because it is, of course, a very distinguishing feature that could betray his identity. He explains away the scar as the result of an operation for carpal tunnel syndrome. Paz complains that he didn't list it on his entry documents as a medical problem, as required. Lecter responds that it shouldn't matter because it is not a disability. It was genius of Zaillian to take that minor exchange in the book and transform it in this film into the tremendous romantic gesture that Hannibal performs in the end. After all, we know for a fact that Hannibal knows how to open a pair of handcuffs. He could do it behind his back. And he has. But now he has disabled himself and given himself an unchangeable physical attribute, putting his freedom at terrible risk for the rest of his life and effectively putting to an end any chance of being a predator. This is how he expresses to Clarice how complete and unswerving his love for her is.I was also very impressed with the excellent choice to move the scene with the little boy on the plane from it's original place in the middle of the book and arranging it to mean different things to different people. Some people think it means he is still a cannibal. That it is Kendler's brain. Can't be. He wouldn't have amputated his hand and then extracted Krendler's brain, cooked it, and then packed it up before he beat it out of the kitchen. It's just a cows brain delicacy from Dean and Deluca's. The scene really represents his regret that he will never know the pleasure of fatherhood. He makes a point of reminding Clarice of the joys of family that she is gave up to pursue her career in the FBI. He was really talking about himself and his regrets.  After all he can convince some one to swallow their own tongue, peel off their face or throw their employer into a hog pit, but he can't convince Clarice of his willingness to change his life for her. That's the poignant irony of the ending. The man who can get any one to do anything can't influence the only person who matters to him. He can change for love but she cannot. That is the ultimate profoundness concerning the difference between the ending of the book and the end of the film. Harris has complained that he feels the objections to the end of the book is coming from people who wish to dumb Clarice down. That these people would wish to halt Clarice's ability to evolve and triumph. I know what Hannibal would call such people. Philistines. And yet I still found the end of the film rueful and moving.

This is how he expresses to Clarice how complete and unswerving his love for her is.I was also very impressed with the excellent choice to move the scene with the little boy on the plane from it's original place in the middle of the book and arranging it to mean different things to different people. Some people think it means he is still a cannibal. That it is Kendler's brain. Can't be. He wouldn't have amputated his hand and then extracted Krendler's brain, cooked it, and then packed it up before he beat it out of the kitchen. It's just a cows brain delicacy from Dean and Deluca's. The scene really represents his regret that he will never know the pleasure of fatherhood. He makes a point of reminding Clarice of the joys of family that she is gave up to pursue her career in the FBI. He was really talking about himself and his regrets.  After all he can convince some one to swallow their own tongue, peel off their face or throw their employer into a hog pit, but he can't convince Clarice of his willingness to change his life for her. That's the poignant irony of the ending. The man who can get any one to do anything can't influence the only person who matters to him. He can change for love but she cannot. That is the ultimate profoundness concerning the difference between the ending of the book and the end of the film. Harris has complained that he feels the objections to the end of the book is coming from people who wish to dumb Clarice down. That these people would wish to halt Clarice's ability to evolve and triumph. I know what Hannibal would call such people. Philistines. And yet I still found the end of the film rueful and moving.

Sophia Loren is a mother who takes her daughter away from the daily bombings in Rome to her childhood home. She is pretty good as the exasperated mother. Maybe not deserving of an award, but she is good. The other very famous actor in the cast is Jean-Paul Belmondo. Both of these actors could have done a lot better if the script were up to par. Both characters are quite superficially stereotypical, and their big scenes are all over the map. I think that is a good phrase for this film, all over the map. Themes are very weakly held throughout, so it feels meandering. By the end, nothing is accomplished. All I could think of were better films that dealt with similar subjects. This is incredibly unfortunate, seeing that de Sica and his screenwriter Zavattini concocted two of the best films of the 1940s, The Bicycle Thieves and Umberto D.SPOILERSThose who love the movie are probably wishing to crucify me right now, since I am criticizing a film in which the central episode is a rape. But really, I did not dislike the film before this scene. Although I felt it meandered, I liked it. But when Loren and her daughter are raped, the movie fell apart. Let me say this just because such a heavy subject is dealt with does not make the movie great. I felt this scene, this plot point, was handled extraordinarily poorly. Instead of seeming horrific, it seemed completely exploitative. After the deed, Loren, certainly a beautiful woman, walks around with her cleavage popping out for the rest of the film. I did not feel that she and her daughter have been destroyed by this incident. Instead, it feels more like an unfortunate thing that happens to them on their journey. The reason for this is that the film ends only about ten minutes later. Since everything before the rape scene had been dealt with more successfully in previous films, I believe the best choice would have been to open the story right before the rape, and have them deal with it afterwards. That way, the gravity of the situation would have hit better.Just randomly, I watched two films tonight that had to do with rape. This one, and right before it, Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring. The Virgin Spring hit me like a sledgehammer, whereas Two Women left me squirming with disappointment. The major difference between the two is that The Virgin Spring had a theme, a point. It went somewhere with the horrible event. Two Women just believed it would be powerful because it happened.  I may sympathize, but I have little empathy, since I do not know what they felt. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 February 2001","score":"","review":"  Vittorio de Sica's _Two Women_ is mostly about the hardships of war (WWII) on normal people.

It has been ten years too long.  So, was the wait worth it?  Upon my viewing of the movie sequel to The Silence Of The Lambs (Lecter's second coming - Manhunter was the first - played then by Brian Cox) Hannibal was worth the wait, and the blood, sweat and tears everyone went through to make the movie.  Anthony Hopkins is back and delicious as ever reprising his most famous role, Dr. Lecter.  True, Lecter is ten years older (along with the rest of us) but he certainly has regained his sense of humor as well as the ironic.  Julianne Moore is Clarice Starling.  The role Jodie Foster played briliantly in Silence.  She along with Jonathan Demme (Silence's director) failed to return for the second course.  Admittingly, Jodie's absence smells of 'what could have been', Julianne Moore holds her own against the evil Dr Lecter. Clarices' role in this film is so well defined however that one could actually imaging Jodie in the role.  For me, I don't see her playing it any differently than Moore.  And Julianne, if by some chance you read this, that is definatley a compliment.  Though Thomas Harris' novel was not well received by fans or critics, I liked it, there are some things that should have been put into the screenplay (written by Steve Zaillian and David Mamet).  The most formidable is the characterization of Mason Verger.  Played superbly by an uncredited Gary Oldman.  The make-up alone should get an award.  For me,  Mason was actually too nice a villain in the movie.  For those of you who read the book you know what I mean.  Mason is a sadistic pedifile who happens to be the only living victim of the good doctor.  I won't tell you how.  It will spoil the suprise.  The character in the book seemed to spew venom any way he turned his head.  In the movie he's a bit more sedate.  One five minute scene in the movie with the young child Franklin would have changed the dynamics had they put it in.  Nevertheless, Oldman was outrageous, cunning, and a real pain the in the butt.  Ray Liotta as Paul Krendler was almost just as bad, without the make-up.  He's holding a grudge against Starling and has for years.  The reason in the movie is not quite clear cut but we get the idea. He too is a formidable foe.  One of the best performances is by Giancarlo Giannini, an Italian actor who plays Rinaldo Pazzi to a tee.  Brilliant work.  Hopefully we will become more acquainted with him in American movies. Then of course there is the master, Anthony Hopkins.  Nobody does it better.  He is stylish, sophisticated, and calm.  So much so, my eyes never left him.  Every movement was smooth as glass.  But that's no surprise. Sir Anthony makes acting look effortless in all his films.  Ridley Scott did an excellent job in his directing ('Gladiator' and 'Themla And Louise'; two other of his gems) did not over step the actors by pushing the scenes in hopes of making them work.  He let them evolve.  No, admittingly, the movie is not flawless. Where Silence was more about the psyche, Hannibal is right in your face.  Some may find many scenes distasteful (pardon the pun) but if you remember it's all in good fun you may only squirm a little.  I laughed in spite of myself.  I found the dark humor throughout.  I did wish there were more passion on Clarice's side of Hannibal's kiss.  I won't give away the ending mainly because it left me wondering myself.  All I will say is, I wonder if he loved her THAT much.  Perhaps.  I'm sure the answer will come in the sequel to follow.  There is already talk of one.  So, go see the movie.  Have a few laughs, cover your eyes and enjoy Anthony Hopkins. Okee Dokee....

No music but a work on sound effects (today the soundtrack is the very first by-product). For the camera work, the importance is not in the filming of the climax scenes. It's the 'resolutive' shots that follow. What I call resolutive shots is the fact you don't just get in the action and then breath. The follow up impression is much more important.'There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.' That was Hitch's definition of suspense. Now he wants us breathless after the bang too. Psycho already did that, sure (remember Hermann's score after the stabbing violins). Just trying a visual experimentation (perhaps Hitch was kinda jealous of Hermann's contribution to the atmosphere of Psycho and he asked him just to make birds sing). You have two examples of resolutive shots in the overwhelming shot of Bodega Bay after the birds attack and when Mitch' mother comes back after she discovered the dead body of a neighbor.The McGuffin is a great one. Why are those birds attacking us gentle human beings? Hitchcock doesn't dare inventing an other story than just filming a McGuffin. He just experiments that one; something of a sadistic attitude to his audience with no packaging. Spielberg did the same thing in Jaws why is the shark so bad? We don't care but there's a non-sadistic ending. On the contrary Hitch shoots as if he loves us and then he fools us. No happy ending.So I think this film is for Hitch fans. Strictly. Others would feel disappointed as they are not sure to understand why they've been fooled. And people usually don't want to understand as long as they feel fooled.

He no more claims to be an authority on war than my kids do. He is a magnificent director and he does his job well, which is bringing realism and emotion to the forefront of an otherwise brutal look at war. The people who put the film together are some of the most knowledgeable and experienced veterans and historians in the world today so, let's give them a little credit. For those of you who have never been there; don't comment on credibility or realism unless you've actually seen it or done it and have something to compare it to.  Saving Private Ryan is undoubtedly the closest most people will ever come to being in the war, thank god!The story is based on the hypothetical scenario of seven U.S. Army Rangers along with a cowardly army corporal\/translator from the 29th infantry division who are given the outrageous task of finding a paratrooper (Pvt. Ryan) who was dropped behind enemy lines in Normandy, France during Operation Overlord in WWII.  As the sole surviving son of a midwestern family, the brass decides it would be noble to find him and send him home when they realize that all three of his brothers have been killed in the line of duty within 24 hours of each other and his mother will be receiving all three telegrams at the same time.  The real story lies in the frustration of the soldiers themselves at trying to cope with risking their lives foolishly for the life of one man who is just another soldier to them. The orders seem ridiculous to the Rangers, but as Tom Hanks' character (Capt. John Miller) keeps reminding them; they are soldiers and it's their duty to follow orders - Period!  It is a good portrayal of a scenario that could've very easily happened during the war.  Other things far more ridiculous than that did happen.  Trust me.The movie is well done and very entertaining if you don't look to find an action movie underneath the story.  It's compelling, moving and the Omaha beach scenes are downright shocking at times.  While the movie makes all efforts to be as historically accurate as possible, please remember that this is not a history lesson or a documentary.  Tom Hanks plays the part of the unknown soldier, a captain of the Rangers second battalion who were the first american units on the beach at Omaha.  The 2d Rangers were also the unit that, despite insurmountable odds, penetrated the german defenses and secured the beachheads for the rest of the Allied units arriving at Omaha on D-Day.  The fact that they played the parts of U.S. Rangers of the second battalion is a true depiction of some of the greatest heroism this country has ever known alone in itself.  It IS a movie about war and true heroism and it IS historically accurate.For those of you who think there was too much flag waving and blatant patriotism; what is wrong with that?  And those of you who think that the germans were portrayed as being too evil?  This movie is about eight soldiers following orders and doing their jobs above and beyond the call of duty.  It has NOTHING to do with who was the good guy and who was the bad guy.  If you want to see a movie that portrays war from a german soldier's point of view, watch All quiet on the western front or, better yet, read the book!I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has any interest in war movies. It IS very accurate historically right down to unit numbers and troop disposition, as well as the general attitude of the soldiers themselves. At least Mr. Spielberg has the common sense to hire some of the best people qualified to make the storyline authoritative, such as Steven Ambrose.  He doesn't take it upon himself to try to re-create history itself.  The effects are astounding and the acting is good.  If you don't like Tom Hanks being portrayed as a patriotic war hero than you definitely won't like this movie.  While he's not John Wayne, Mr. Hanks is definitely America's archetypical hero actor of today.  Don't make the mistake of comparing Private Ryan to Vietnam war flicks.
