[{"date":"28 October 1999","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  There are some real hair brained idiots that have made postings on this site trashing this movie for absolutely no good reason. To the person who thought it was unrealistic,had lousy dialogue, said dolphins dont exist in that part of the ocean, and that theres no way people can survive in that cold of water for more than 3 minutes?? Are you a scientist? You know all of this for a fact?? You mean to tell me that every single film that you have seen, every single second,every frame has to be 100% realisitc or you give it a good dissing?? It's obvious you have done no research on this tragedy before you posted your careless remarks. First of all...according to the Dolphin Research Institute, Dolphins DO exist in those waters. According to records of the sinking, some survivors in the waters lived for up to 15 minutes before freezing to death, not the 3 minutes you claim. And you actually think the dialogue is worthy of a kindergarden movie?? Give me a break. You can honestly say that the script didnt make you laugh or get a watery eye at least once?? You ripped this movie to shreds for no good reason. You based your opinions on nothing but untruths. The special effects in this film are phenomenal and its obvious James Cameron did his homework before making this film. The ship was reconstructed almost to a tee.  Perhaps you and wifey should rent ISHTAR or Police Academy 5 ,,sounds like those movies are more about your speed. Happy viewing!
