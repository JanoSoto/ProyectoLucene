While he is dubbed a horror writer, he is much more than that. He is a character writer, and while his novels are intended to scare, characters are the central point of the novels. They rely so heavily on backstory that the characters are practically real. However, this is very hard to do on film and it can result in making the story seem unimportant. So, as you can expect, I was not eager to see how they could ruin The Shining. Well, after reading the spectacular novel, I moved onto the film. After watching the film, I was flaming mad. The film The Shining does not fail from their overuse of backstory. These characters are completely shallow and you don't care about them. King novels are hard to adapt, but they can be done well. Carrie is an example of that. However, this movie is an awful adaptation. Kubrick basically took some character names, some locations, and made his own scary hotel movie. Why he couldn't just make his own scary hotel movie, I don't know. The acting is, for the most part, garbage. Shelley Duvall gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen. She's just so awful that you want her to get killed, as opposed to the novel. I just felt that I didn't care about anybody in this film. It felt empty and like there was no point to anything in the end. King said that he doesn't like the film because it doesn't make you feel. I agree completely with that. I felt nothing other than lack of interest when I watched this stinker. It wasn't even passable as a good stand-alone film. I hated every minute of this film. It was supposedly psychological horror, but it didn't make me think at all. This movie is horrible, and I hope book readers never have to witness an adaptation as bad as this atrocity...well, okay, there is the '97 TV movie, but even that's not as bad as this crap!

By night, they cruise the city, hopping from nightclub to nightclub, failing to gain entry to the holy grail that is The Roxbury. By day they sleep it all off, while managing to find time to work in the plastic plant store owned by their father. Their dream of becoming night-club hot-shots comes true when Richard Grieco (of 21 Jump Street fame) rear-ends them, and in lieu of a lawsuit, agrees to get the brothers into their dream club. From there they make a new, high-profile connection, hook up with a couple of gold-diggers who give them some much needed life-experience while simultaneously proving to the world that they aren't massive failures and\/or losers. Starring opposite Ferrell and Kattan are other SNL alumni Molly Shannon, Colin Quinn and Mark McKinney, as well as Lochlyn Munro, Dan Hedaya, Loni Anderson, Michael Clark Duncan, Eva Mendes ad Jennifer Coolidge.

The movie has got limited appeal and screams 1990's but if you're willing enough to let your guard down and enjoy a light-weight buddy comedy, A Night At The Roxbury will do just fine. With Will Ferrell showing some early comedic chops and obvious improvisation, as well as a strong nostalgic sense, it's the kind of movie that is hard not to at least crack a smile at. ","genre":"Comedy, Music, Romance"},{"date":"27 March 2009","score":"","review":" ******SPOILERS*******There are so many reasons I love this movie. To begin with, there's Robert Redford's direction. I can't think of another movie he has directed that I'd call memorable, but he certainly got it right on this one. From the opening shot of the lake, more meaningful for those not viewing the film for the first time, somberly presented with the delicate first notes of the Pacobel Canon. Then the picturesque scenes around Lake Forrest in all it's Autumnal glory, as the music gradually builds. A perfect upper-middle class neighborhood, with perfect houses and perfect lawns. But we soon learn that all is not perfect in this scene as Redford cuts from Conrad Jarrett singing with the glee club, to Conrad Jarret suddenly sitting bolt upright in bed, gasping for breath and drenched in sweat. The cause his brother died in a boating accident, after which Conrad tried to commit suicide.A few scenes later Redford tellingly begins the breakfast scene with a shot of Beth's hands setting glasses of orange juice on the table - first two glasses set down together, then the third glass very deliberately placed on the table by itself. In this simple gesture we get an immediate sense of Conrad's feelings of isolation, even in his own home, and Beth's idea of his position in the family. It is in this same scene that we first witness Beth's callous attitude toward her youngest son. The way she immediately takes away his French toast when he says he's not hungry, not even giving him a chance to change his mind, and brusquely shoves it down the garbage disposal. When her husband Calvin protests she coldly tells him, You can't save French toast. Possibly a metaphor for how she feels about her damaged son. Then comes the condescending attitude, when she asks him if he wants her to sign him up for a golf tournament. He says, I haven't played in a year. She counters with a judgmental, Don't you think it's time you did? In other words, Beth thinks it's high time her weak son got over his suicidal angst. In this deceptively simple scene Redford neatly sets the tone for the 3 main characters troubled, isolated Conrad; supportive, puzzled Calvin; cold, unfeeling Beth.The acting is brilliant. Hutton is easy to identify with as Conrad. The scenes where he courts Jeannine Pratt ( an engaging Elizabeth McGovern) show his warm and endearing side. He also skillfully captures Conrad's emotional turmoil. His scenes with Dr Berger (Judd Hirsch) show great range and depth. Their emotional breakthrough is honest and touching (and, by the way, copied almost shot-for-shot in the film Good Will Hunting). Donald Sutherland hits the right notes as Calvin Jarrett. His big emotional scene at the end rings true precisely because of his steady, supportive characterization throughout the entire film. I love the scene where he talks to Beth about the day their son died. Hirsch is also quite good as Conrad's psychologist.Top acting honors, however, must go to Mary Tyler Moore as Beth Jarrett. It would be easy to have Beth become a stereotypical monster mother whose rigid, demanding, unloving personality have probably contributed as much to her son's mental state as the family tragedy they have endured. But MTM's Beth isn't one dimensional. We see her warm moments, mostly with her husband and in a couple of key flashbacks. She's that good friend you think you're close to, but not really. Moore has so many great moments in the film. The scene with Conrad in the backyard, when she tries to draw him out, then quickly retreats when he mentions his dead brother. There's the picture-taking scene, which begins like a Kodak commercial, endures a blow-up by Conrad, and ends with the unflappable Beth casually saying, Smile as she snaps a picture. There's the big Christmas tree scene, where it becomes obvious that one sure way to draw Beth's ire is to let a friend find out personal family info before she knows about it. I also love the scene where she has lunch with Calvin in the department store. They're discussing private family business when a waitress intrudes. The way Moore cuts off her sentence, gives the waitress a curt, superficial smile, then resumes her sentence after the waitress leaves, is shear genius. But my favorite scene is the big golfing blow-up, where we see Beth go from being a lucky golfer to a screaming harpy in a matter of seconds. You have to feel sorry for her brother, Ward, when he steps in and tells her everybody just wants her to be happy. He should know better, having grown up with Beth. Her scathing reply make it clear she knows a lot about being unhappyHappy? Ward you tell me what's happy? But first you better make sure your kids are safe. That none of them have fallen out of a tree, or been hit by a car, or drowned in that pool you're so proud of! Then you come to me and tell me how to be happy!I think Mary Tyler Moore gives a near perfect performance in Ordinary People. With apologies to Sissy Spacek, MTM deserved the Best Actress Oscar.One criticism of OP that I've heard is that it ends too neatly. Their complaint was something along the lines of, Not every kid gets better. I don't see how this applies to OP. Sure, Conrad was helped by his therapy, and at the end of the film he is better, though I get the sense he is far from healed. As for his family, it has been devastated AND strengthened at the same time. OP is a hopeful film that deals with complex issues in a very satisfying manner. I think it has aged well over the past 30 years, and it still ranks as one of my favorite films of all time.

Watching an important film for the first time is such a profound experience that one should pace oneself. Conceptual gluttony may not be a sin, but its unwise if you take film seriously. It provides yet stronger reasons to hang around.I've saved this film for 30 years to watch for a special birthday, and opened it carefully. It did not disappoint. I recommend it to you as something worth saving. I think it is something best encountered after enough life to register &#151; it surely does not surf energetic hope as most films do.Some background, if you do not know Tarkovsky. I rate him as among the three filmmakers now dead who have influenced me. Recommendations at this level can only come from personal reports of the great voyage into the unknown and how the filmmaker has led one through dangerous, oracular terrain. It is what Tarkovsky does for me, as the most cinematic of the greats. And it is how this story is framed.There are three men here a scientist, a writer and the guide. The journey is abstract, as presented visually through the most hypnotizing environments you will ever touch. These are textured spaces, always strictly architectural and derived (by wear, use and penetration of the wild) from ordinary built structures.The journey is presented in a way that can be seen as a general Godot-inspired existential drift. On reading observations from others, even serious thinkers, this seems to be how most people experience this. I would like you to consider a deeper experience. Elsewhere, I heavily criticize movies that depict mathematical or artistic breakthroughs and they might as well be depicting a sporting success. Beautiful Mind, Good Will, and Pi come to mind. The problem is that actual search, actual conceptual risk &#151; which is the idea in these movies &#151; is fully cinematic, strongly shaped by internal narrative and highly visual in the sense of escaping the images of worn dreams. These movies miss the boat, probably because no one involved has been there.Tarkovsky has, at least as a guide. He not only understands the angst of living in abstract webs of fluid risk, but knows the internal collaborative tension between the writer and the scientist, and between each and the outside world of reified happenstance, and also among all those and the edge of family and love. All of these we can literally see. It is an absolutely miraculous experience. Save it for when it can matter.This is quite different than other Tarkovsky works I think. It is more removed from experience of life, more deliberately unrooted in the flesh. It transforms sex into rougher refinement of urge. It will be less accessible than, say, the meditations on the body and place of in Nostalgia and Mirror, which themselves are apart from the even more open notion of self and nation (as religion) in Andrei Rublov. For this reason, I will advise working up to this because the biggest disaster would be for you to see this for the first time and not place yourself in it. Break yourself first.My rule for rating a film 4 out of three is that no more than two per year and two from each filmmaker. Andrei has two others rated 4, which I think are essential. This is more powerful and personal than those, but consequently more elusive.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

Although the words that come out of these people's mouth often result in uproars of laughter, Woody Allen has directed these actors to express emotion through their eyes and body movement instead of their words, which takes a lot of skill.

This scathing and realistic depiction of the US political scene however was much more rewarding allowing both Ritchie and Redford to shine in an excellent drama, making use of a fly-on-the-wall, almost documentary technique to paint a convincing warts-and-all picture of the machinery which it seems is necessary for the candidature of an aspiring US senator.Being from Britain, of course some of the background and terminology used was slightly foreign, but the film holds up really well on a universal basis, particularly in its portrayal of what we'd now term behind the scenes spin-doctors and the fronting of a political machine by a young good-looking idealistic conviction-politician against an old-style right-wing ultra-conservative rival - the parallels between the Blair\/Major UK election of 1997 and obviously 2008 Obama\/McCain US election, while not exact, are certainly palpable.I personally rate this as Redford's best ever acting display - he seems an absolute natural as the initially energetic, moral, campaigning, but no-hope candidate, who learns the hard way about compromise, political correctness and above all how the arcane machinery of politics USA actually works. Thus we see him on the stump in amusing vox-pops with eccentric or bemused members of the public, cleaning up his physical appearance and generalising his ideals for the sake of bland, voter-friendly rhetoric and even falling victim to the temptations of the flesh to an obsessive female follower, this last point, concisely and effectively made without over-dramatisation (c.f. Gary Hart and of course Pres. Clinton himself) - for sure Redford's McKay character did have sexual relations with this woman, but lives to tell the tale.Tension is built up as election day looms, and we see McKay starting to break down under the pressure as he resorts to gibberish en-route to a TV studio but by then his on-side advertising campaign, highlighting his good-looks, youthful vigour but playing down his more controversial left-of-centre views, propels him to an unlikely win against his incumbent opponent and by the surprise ending just at the point of victory, the director I think is telling us that the movie is less about the contest than the process itself. A similar ending device was used at the end of Downhill Racer but it works far better this time as you genuinely are intrigued by Redford's multi-dimensional character and wonder just what kind of senator he would have made. The absence of a sequel was definitely a missed opportunity here.A quick word about the ensemble acting - it's uniformly good and verite is reinforced with the appearances of a number of real-life personalities ranging all the way from pre CNN-era TV commentators to Natalie Wood at a fund-raiser, although quite what an uncredited Groucho Marx is doing haranguing Redford in a toilet is anyone's guess.In closing then a brave, uncompromising, multi-layered and above all entertaining insight into contemporary US politics of the early 70's.

The only watchable Moore Bond movies are Live and Let Die and maybe The Spy Who Loved Me.Why did they decide to replace Connery with the older Moore in the first place (yes, both were over the hill, so why not go with a young talent that could have made the late 70's and 80's Bond movies tolerable).

However, what could have been an interesting and entertaining study of the military and intelligence failures\/successes and the change of American attitudes fails because Randall Wallace (who wrote the awful Braveheart) turned the story into no more then a romantic film whilst Michael Bay tries to pay to his strengths which is bombastic action and Jerry Bruckheimer whilst is the master of dumb blockbusters. The film markers felt that they needed to turn an American tragedy into a success and a patriotic exercise.The casting was terrible. Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale all can't act and they end up as the leads. Kate Beckinsale's character, Evelyn, a Navy nurse, who ends up having a relationship with Rafe (Ben Affleck). However Rafe is called to serve in the Eagle Squadron in the Battle of Britain and asks Danny (Josh Hartnett) to take care of Evelyn for him. However when they both think Red had died they end up comfort each other and end up having a relationship together when stationed in Pearl Harbour. But Red comes back and you can imagine he is a little upset and falls up with both of them. But things get patched up when Japan attacks. I did not believe in the relationships that Evelyn has but if anything it should be Rafe and Danny have sex with each other.They are some subplots as well in the film. There is President Roosevelt (Jon Voight) who has to lead the country through the crisis and Voight is best performer in the film. Another element is the story of Doris Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who is the first black sailor to win the Navy Cross. However it felt like Cuba Gooding Jr. was no more then the token black guy. There is also some romantic elements involving Pilots and Nurses (the nurses are a right bunch of slags).The writing is awful. There is nothing but war movie clichés and terrible dialogue. The film has historical inaccuracies, but Wallace has never seen history as an important in historical films. He insults the memories of British and American pilots and portrays the Japanese as a blood thirsty and backwards people. The number of Americans who fought in the Battle of Britain was small and not servicemen picked by the air force. They were volunteers who opposed Fascism and not in the American Air Force. They were brave men, like the British, Canadians, French, Polish, Czechs etc... who all fought in the battle. The other major problems is they is no reason why the Japanese attacked America, no look at the run up to the war. There is only a brief mention that Japan was running out of oil but that's it. Also the film makes out that Red and Danny did most of the fighting for the air force, able to fly fighters and bombers and getting involved in the Doolittle raids which insults the real pilots who were involved. As well the film makes out that the Doolittle Raid was an important event, but it was really a foot-note, doing nothing for against the Japanese whilst only a propaganda tool for the Americans. I'm a believe that historical accuracy should be maintained all times in films and shouldn't take too much of an artistic license to real events. But Wallace doesn't understand that. The same critics and fans who praised Braveheart thinking history isn't important take a hypocritical view with Pearl Harbour. Americans feel insulting other countries history is okay, but when it comes to American history it's basically 'How dare they'. Roger Ebert is a good example.The visuals are impressive and some of the scenes during the bombing sequence are fun, but it isn't enough. The whole film is too long and drags. During the bombing sequence some moments are totally unbelievable and makes the film silly. It's the same with the end after the places clash in China, with American pilots with small arms easily kill Japanese soldiers, but only one of them dies. The final narration was sickening saying America never suffered a defeat, recovered and became all powerful what about Vietnam? What about the efforts of Britain, the Commonwealth (i.e. Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand etc...), the Soviet Union and the Chinese? Bay was properly the worst choice of director because he is no more then an action director. He doesn't do deep story or romance or very much really. The film needed a director of gravitas like Spielberg or Scorsese to happen a lot of material. But most of the blame is reserved for Wallace.A new film about Pearl Harbour would have had so much potential but Americans can't accept a defeat. The military, diplomatic and intelligence all could have made an interesting film or book, but Wallace thought an fictional story was needed. No it isn't!Pearl Harbour tries to be a hybrid of Titanic and Saving Private Ryan, but fails on both. It is a really bad film.
