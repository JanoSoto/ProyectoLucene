To all the critics and nay sayers out there I would just like to say that I think you all might be just a little crazy.What I liked.In one word, ACTION!!! From start to finish this film has an exciting energy that makes you want more.Interactions between characters.  It was great to see the characters together in this movie.  I though the relationship between Obi-wan and Skywalker was great.  I truly felt the relationship between master and student.  A relationship that included respect, love and friendship coupled with jelousy and rebelion.This movie is filled with ACTION!!!!!The love story.  OK, call me and old softy, call me a wuss or what ever, but I really enjoyed seeing this on screen.  I was truly touched by the longing that Anakin felt when he expresed his love for Padme.  What's amazing is that I felt this way even through some really clunky dialog.  Thats a testament to both Portman and Christinsesn and their ability to take so-so lines and breath life into them.THE ACTION!!!The comedy of this film was great.  I laughed so many times at this flick. Lucas did a great job of encorporating the the aformentioned action sequences with a comedic feel.  McGreggor has a couple of really great one liners during some of his sceens, and in the final battle C-3PO actualy achives what Jar-Jar was supose to in TPM, make us laugh with strait physical comedy.What I didn't likeThere were very few things that I didn't like but there were a fewJar-Jar.  Even though hes only in the movie for a few sceens he still managed to suck.  I do like the fact that he is responsible for giving The Palpatine ultimate power if for no other reason than to hate him more.The Dialog(specificly the love story)  While I thought most of the dialog was ok, the love story lines were pretty lame.  If George got his wife with stuff like this God help her.  One line in particular stand above all others as bad.  That's the one about the sand.  I won't repeat it here, it shouldn't be repeated anywhere.  Luckly as I said before, in a whole the dialog doesn't destroy the film, but it dose stick in you side from time to time.Jar-Jar. Still have a bad taste in my mouth from TPM.  Wish Mace would have decapatated him instead of Fett.Wanted to see Anakin kill the Tuskin raiders.  This is just a small little point but I thought that would be cool.  I guess George wants to hold off on that kind of evil untill E3.Jar-Jar, Come on, you knew it was coming.All in all, I really enjoyed this movie.  I would have to say that it ranks up there right behind Empire but dosen't quite beat it, but what movie can. Im glad to see that Lucas isn't such a dope after all. One of my biggest problems with TPM was that I spent half the movie looking forward to the parts coming up.  Not so with the origional triloigy and not so for this movie.

Phantom menace, aside from the uninteresting plot and sub-par acting, had rather lacklustre action that was just annoyingly cheesy or boring, or had an annoying 9 year old commentating on what he was doing, the only saving grace in my mind was the excellent pod race. What episode 2 does is take the major flaws of episode 1 and improve on them, the bad guy in this played by Christopher Lee is far more interesting than mute ninja Jedi Darth Maul from the first film, in that he has lines and is menacing to a degree more just than frowns, red face paint and a double ended lightsaber, which while cool in the eyes of a 6 year old really annoyed me, it just wasn't necessary. Anyway Episode 2 is much better but it still is a long way from being close to the original trilogy, what made the first three classics was the fact that it never set out to be a big blockbuster, it was a film Lucas wanted to make which was totally his vision and which he was catering for himself, producers thought it would fail but it didn't, it had charm, it was an adventure, it was remarkably ground breaking, the actors were great, the script was funny and exciting with an interesting story and the characters were likeable and held the screen. The two prequels have fallen in the blockbuster syndrome trap, they have purely ahead of anything else tried to make them gross as much as possible by loading them with cool special effects and stylish light saber action instead of trying to re-capture the style and the tongue in cheek charm of the original trilogy that marked them down in cinema history as classics. The prequels are more like action films than fantasy adventure, with Lucas and the producers thinking that a great action scene is loading the screen with computer generated effects and having the actors do karate and spinning their sabers around like a ninja, somewhere between return of the Jedi and Phantom menace Lucas has been inspired by Jackie Chan Movies, and I personally think it doesn't work, we don't want kung-fu in star wars we want Sabers being swung violently slicing through pillars, we want intermissions where an opponent hides waiting to strike, to build up tension. The action scenes are exciting, the special effects are exceptional but I find the action in the originals more exciting because I like the characters more, they didn't suffer a touch from effects overkill like the prequels have done, there are too many effects as great as they are, and at times they were overly ambitious with some shots.Anyway a simpler approach to voice my opinions will be to list good and bad points, there are in my book more bad but the good points outweigh the bad. Firstly the good. The action is great, the effects at times will blow you away, all the action scenes are exciting and in particular a scene shot in the rain between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett also towards the end when the Jedi's fight with Count Dooku's soldiers, it was manic but exciting. I think that Christopher Lee was very good as Dooku, we all know Mr Lee is one of the silver screens ultimate baddies and we know that he was gonna be a bad guy in this from minute one because you don't employ Christopher Lee to be the good guy. Also to a certain extent Ewan Mcgregor was good, he has improved since Phantom Menace and plays a more key role but you always feel like Ewans doing a two hour Alec Guiness impression which doesn't always work. Natalie Portman was good, she has been rather slated for being wooden inthis and Phantom but her character is like that, when Amidala expresses her feelings more, towards the end, Portman shines she also looks good holding a gun. Also Yoda fights, we finally see the little dude in action, unfortunately I saw this as downright hilarious, he hobbles around for the whole movie and is unable to travel more than 30 yards without using a floating platform and then all of a sudden he's jumping and flipping around the room like a muppet and acid. That was not terribly exciting but it did provide comic relief. So overall there is a big excitement factor here. Also its great to see little references to the originals such as the plans to the death star. Bad points, still no strong characters, this movies so needs a Han Solo, a Luke and a Leia but we don't have that, it lacks the great interplay they had, Ford damn carried those movies alone he was so good and to add to the class of them his support was excellent. Hayden Christianson didn't convince me, I don't rate him as an actor and I certainly cannot picture him as Vader. He delivered his lines too woodenly or too over the top while at times coming across like a petulant child. The dialogue was terrible, sure the lines in the Star Wars films are notoriously cheesy, so much so that Guiness hated spouting them, but they were fun, the comedy factor worked because of the chemistry on screen, this film and Menace completely lacked chemistry and any humour rarely hit the mark. Count Dooku is underused, also the plot has two many politicla sub-plots like Menace that are incoherent and I doubt youngsters will really follow, then again they will be there for the effects so they'll be happy. The plot was uninteresting, it didn't draw you in as the original trilogy did, it lacks classic twist such as `I am your father Luke' and the acting is also not very good, so far the casting of Anakin in both prequels have disappointed me. Just going back to the poor dialogue, it was everything said, such as the love scenes everything was cliche or just plain stupid and they have two many poor comedy attempts. There are some lines that were so bad that my head hurt, for instance Dooku says to Yoda, `it is obvious we both have equal powers in the force, we shall have to see who is more skilled at using a lightsaber'(or somethin like that) and the line was delivered like the dubbing of a 70's martial arts flick, if they had made Mr Lee look like he was dubbed it may have got some laughs, a missed opportunity I think. Some scenes really dragged, such as the dull love scenes in which no Chemistry was shown. The pacing was not great due to the fact that it is so difficult to direct a movie this heavily laden with CGI effects. Furthermore, the inclusions of C-3P0 and R2-D2 seem pointless, C-3P0 was no purpose at all so they use him as comic relief, unfortunately he has been really camped up and his lines are awful it just makes you secretly wish he gets blown to smithereens but we know that unfortunately he won't. R2 also has no purpose and for some reason it seems he downgrades over the years because in this film he can fly. That is another problem, the film like Phantom Menace has everything looking far more advanced than in the original three, you get the sleek designs in vehicles that are very 2000 and then in the originals there's the rather squarish looks of the 70's with some dodgy mullets to boot. Also Samuel L Jackson disappointed me somewhat, he is good with the acting but when they had him whip out his Light-saber(nothing dirty) and use it he look kind of over-awed at the fact he was in a Star Wars film and he was using one, he didn't use it too convincingly and I thought at any moment he was gonna start jumping for joy.Basically this film is enjoyable, it does take itself a little too seriously at times and suffers from it, aside from the action and effects there is nothing to write home about. This still falls far short of the originals and in the recent blockbuster wars between this, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings this pails in comparison to Frodo's adventure although for me it beats Potter, my advice is see it, it does make up for Phantom menace, and also leaves you wanting to see the next one to carry on the story for some conclusion, unlike menace where I really wasn't bothered, this is film no 2 of the year behind Panic Room, and I now look forward to the release of its rival Spiderman to the UK. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 May 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Possible Spoilers!Firstly, Attack of the clones is a big, big, improvement on the dire Phantom menace, first and foremost is the fact that while relying on special fx thrills and action, as phantom did, the action itself is actually exciting.

Hayden Christianson didn't convince me, I don't rate him as an actor and I certainly cannot picture him as Vader. He delivered his lines too woodenly or too over the top while at times coming across like a petulant child. The dialogue was terrible, sure the lines in the Star Wars films are notoriously cheesy, so much so that Guiness hated spouting them, but they were fun, the comedy factor worked because of the chemistry on screen, this film and Menace completely lacked chemistry and any humour rarely hit the mark. Count Dooku is underused, also the plot has two many politicla sub-plots like Menace that are incoherent and I doubt youngsters will really follow, then again they will be there for the effects so they'll be happy. The plot was uninteresting, it didn't draw you in as the original trilogy did, it lacks classic twist such as `I am your father Luke' and the acting is also not very good, so far the casting of Anakin in both prequels have disappointed me. Just going back to the poor dialogue, it was everything said, such as the love scenes everything was cliche or just plain stupid and they have two many poor comedy attempts. There are some lines that were so bad that my head hurt, for instance Dooku says to Yoda, `it is obvious we both have equal powers in the force, we shall have to see who is more skilled at using a lightsaber'(or somethin like that) and the line was delivered like the dubbing of a 70's martial arts flick, if they had made Mr Lee look like he was dubbed it may have got some laughs, a missed opportunity I think. Some scenes really dragged, such as the dull love scenes in which no Chemistry was shown. The pacing was not great due to the fact that it is so difficult to direct a movie this heavily laden with CGI effects. Furthermore, the inclusions of C-3P0 and R2-D2 seem pointless, C-3P0 was no purpose at all so they use him as comic relief, unfortunately he has been really camped up and his lines are awful it just makes you secretly wish he gets blown to smithereens but we know that unfortunately he won't. R2 also has no purpose and for some reason it seems he downgrades over the years because in this film he can fly. That is another problem, the film like Phantom Menace has everything looking far more advanced than in the original three, you get the sleek designs in vehicles that are very 2000 and then in the originals there's the rather squarish looks of the 70's with some dodgy mullets to boot. Also Samuel L Jackson disappointed me somewhat, he is good with the acting but when they had him whip out his Light-saber(nothing dirty) and use it he look kind of over-awed at the fact he was in a Star Wars film and he was using one, he didn't use it too convincingly and I thought at any moment he was gonna start jumping for joy.Basically this film is enjoyable, it does take itself a little too seriously at times and suffers from it, aside from the action and effects there is nothing to write home about. This still falls far short of the originals and in the recent blockbuster wars between this, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings this pails in comparison to Frodo's adventure although for me it beats Potter, my advice is see it, it does make up for Phantom menace, and also leaves you wanting to see the next one to carry on the story for some conclusion, unlike menace where I really wasn't bothered, this is film no 2 of the year behind Panic Room, and I now look forward to the release of its rival Spiderman to the UK. 7\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"20 May 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Possible Spoilers!Firstly, Attack of the clones is a big, big, improvement on the dire Phantom menace, first and foremost is the fact that while relying on special fx thrills and action, as phantom did, the action itself is actually exciting. Phantom menace, aside from the uninteresting plot and sub-par acting, had rather lacklustre action that was just annoyingly cheesy or boring, or had an annoying 9 year old commentating on what he was doing, the only saving grace in my mind was the excellent pod race. What episode 2 does is take the major flaws of episode 1 and improve on them, the bad guy in this played by Christopher Lee is far more interesting than mute ninja Jedi Darth Maul from the first film, in that he has lines and is menacing to a degree more just than frowns, red face paint and a double ended lightsaber, which while cool in the eyes of a 6 year old really annoyed me, it just wasn't necessary. Anyway Episode 2 is much better but it still is a long way from being close to the original trilogy, what made the first three classics was the fact that it never set out to be a big blockbuster, it was a film Lucas wanted to make which was totally his vision and which he was catering for himself, producers thought it would fail but it didn't, it had charm, it was an adventure, it was remarkably ground breaking, the actors were great, the script was funny and exciting with an interesting story and the characters were likeable and held the screen. The two prequels have fallen in the blockbuster syndrome trap, they have purely ahead of anything else tried to make them gross as much as possible by loading them with cool special effects and stylish light saber action instead of trying to re-capture the style and the tongue in cheek charm of the original trilogy that marked them down in cinema history as classics. The prequels are more like action films than fantasy adventure, with Lucas and the producers thinking that a great action scene is loading the screen with computer generated effects and having the actors do karate and spinning their sabers around like a ninja, somewhere between return of the Jedi and Phantom menace Lucas has been inspired by Jackie Chan Movies, and I personally think it doesn't work, we don't want kung-fu in star wars we want Sabers being swung violently slicing through pillars, we want intermissions where an opponent hides waiting to strike, to build up tension. The action scenes are exciting, the special effects are exceptional but I find the action in the originals more exciting because I like the characters more, they didn't suffer a touch from effects overkill like the prequels have done, there are too many effects as great as they are, and at times they were overly ambitious with some shots.Anyway a simpler approach to voice my opinions will be to list good and bad points, there are in my book more bad but the good points outweigh the bad. Firstly the good. The action is great, the effects at times will blow you away, all the action scenes are exciting and in particular a scene shot in the rain between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett also towards the end when the Jedi's fight with Count Dooku's soldiers, it was manic but exciting. I think that Christopher Lee was very good as Dooku, we all know Mr Lee is one of the silver screens ultimate baddies and we know that he was gonna be a bad guy in this from minute one because you don't employ Christopher Lee to be the good guy. Also to a certain extent Ewan Mcgregor was good, he has improved since Phantom Menace and plays a more key role but you always feel like Ewans doing a two hour Alec Guiness impression which doesn't always work. Natalie Portman was good, she has been rather slated for being wooden inthis and Phantom but her character is like that, when Amidala expresses her feelings more, towards the end, Portman shines she also looks good holding a gun. Also Yoda fights, we finally see the little dude in action, unfortunately I saw this as downright hilarious, he hobbles around for the whole movie and is unable to travel more than 30 yards without using a floating platform and then all of a sudden he's jumping and flipping around the room like a muppet and acid. That was not terribly exciting but it did provide comic relief. So overall there is a big excitement factor here. Also its great to see little references to the originals such as the plans to the death star. Bad points, still no strong characters, this movies so needs a Han Solo, a Luke and a Leia but we don't have that, it lacks the great interplay they had, Ford damn carried those movies alone he was so good and to add to the class of them his support was excellent.

Conversely then, what can be said about knowledge?  About knowing too much?  Can genius, for example, be equated with a life of torment?  Can knowing-- and more precisely, understanding-- too much bring about anguish and unhappiness?  The answer to that , of course, cannot be absolute, for there are a number of variables that must first be factored in, one of the most prevalent being that thin line that separates the true genius from madness, and how close to which side of that line the individual in question resides.  It's a situation examined in depth by director Peter Weir, in his riveting, thought provoking drama, `The Mosquito Coast,' starring Harrison Ford, Helen Mirren and River Phoenix.\tAllie Fox (Ford) is a family man; he has a devoted wife, `Mother (Mirren),' and four children, the eldest of whom, Charlie (Phoenix), thinks his dad is a genius.  Which he is.  Allie Fox is an inventor who believes it's man's job to tinker with an unfinished world and make it work.  He is also a true individual, the epitome of the man who marches to his own drum-- and in his case, his drum is the `only' one he will march to.  He sees such potential in everything around him, but he also sees that very same potential being wasted at every turn by seemingly everyone, from the average guy just trying to make a living, to a Corporate America he sees as the impetus that has already begun to destroy the nation.  All around him he sees a country and a people that has lost that spirit that made America strong; he sees ruin and decay in everything  In the lack of quality in any and all manufactured goods, and in the apathy of the acquiescent consumer.  And he's had enough.  Refusing to stand by and watch America die, he packs up and moves his family to a remote section of a jungle in Central America, near the coast of La Moskitia; and it is there that he discovers a land, that to him, is paradise-- and where he also encounters the demons that plague those who know too much, and feel too deeply.\tWorking from an intelligent and penetrating screenplay by Paul Schrader (adapted from the novel by Paul Theroux), Weir delivers a thoroughly engrossing character study that parallels Werner Herzog's 1972 masterpiece, `Aguirre, The Wrath of God,' inasmuch as it examines the effects of self-perceived omnipotence in an individual driven to extreme measures by a singular quest for power and autonomy (albeit in different times and with different motives).  Allie Fox, like Don Lope de Aguirre, becomes a victim of his own obsession, consequently victimizing those around him, as well, by losing sight of his own ideals and getting swept away in the current of a distorted sense of purpose.  Allie leaves an environment he perceives as defective for one that is ultimately equally flawed-- that being the environs within his own mind.  All of which is hauntingly presented by Weir, aided by John Seale and Maurice Jarre, whose cinematography and score, respectively, helps to create the atmosphere that so effectively underscores the drama of the story.\tAs Allie Fox, Harrison Ford gives a performance that is one of his best and most powerful ever, affecting a commanding presence that dominates virtually every scene-- so compelling that his presence is felt even when he is absent from the screen.  This isn't a character you are going to like, necessarily; and yet you are going to care about him, because there's something in him that reflects and addresses concerns that are universal, which makes Allie someone to whom many in the audience will be able to relate and identify.  He's the man who believes that he truly `can' be an island unto himself, and beyond his personal peccadilloes, that is the kind of strength that demands admiration; for at the same time, it enables forgiveness.  It's a solid portrayal of a man at cross purposes with himself, who realizes to some extent what he is doing, yet adamantly refuses to back down.  And this is the man Ford brings to life so vividly; he's convincing, and his Allie Fox is disconcertingly real.\tHelen Mirren also turns in a memorable performance as Allie's devoted wife, whom he calls `Mother.'  Mirren says more without dialogue-- through a subtle expression, or even the merest glance-- than most actors do with a limitless number of words.  And it's her moments of silence that are some of the most telling of the film, while at the same time adding strength to the lines she does recite.  In the end, Mirren creates a character who chooses her words well, then uses them wisely-- and it's a portrayal that is, without question, one of the strengths of the film.  In the way Mother looks at Allie, Mirren conveys that love and absolute loyalty that makes everything they do believable.  There is complete trust there, which you can feel when, standing in her kitchen, for example, she gives a final glance at the dishes piled high in the sink; a glance at the life she's leaving behind to follow her husband.  And she's happy.  In it's simplicity and brevity, it's a powerful scene that says so much about who she is, and who `they' are.  And Mirren makes it work beautifully.\tPhoenix does a solid job, too, providing the narrative of the film as Charlie.  He is perfectly cast as Ford's son, and he succeeds in giving `The Mosquito Coast' that sense of reflection and perspective that makes it a truly memorable, and emotionally involving, film.  9\/10.  \t       ","genre":null},{"date":"20 May 2002","score":"34 out of 43 people found the following review useful","review":"  \tSomeone once said that ignorance is bliss; and if you follow through the reasoning process that leads to that conclusion, you discover that it is, indeed, true.

And Hayden Christensen does an okay job, if he's supposed to be so whiney and overstuffed.  Poor Ewan McGregor tries so hard to give his character life, but how can he with such HORRIBLE dialog.  For instance, in one scene C3PO is having his head dragged along by R2D2 and Lucas actually has him say `This is such a drag'.  COME ON!  Are we all 12?  Is this supposed to entertain us?  George, move aside and let someone else make a good movie.  You can still put your fancy schmancy logo in front of it, but why don't you give something for the intelligent folks to enjoy too, other then stealing our money for yet a 3rd time.

Natalie Portman is a good actress, all she needs is a little direction.  You know, that thing the Director is supposed to do.  And Hayden Christensen does an okay job, if he's supposed to be so whiney and overstuffed.  Poor Ewan McGregor tries so hard to give his character life, but how can he with such HORRIBLE dialog.  For instance, in one scene C3PO is having his head dragged along by R2D2 and Lucas actually has him say `This is such a drag'.  COME ON!  Are we all 12?  Is this supposed to entertain us?  George, move aside and let someone else make a good movie.  You can still put your fancy schmancy logo in front of it, but why don't you give something for the intelligent folks to enjoy too, other then stealing our money for yet a 3rd time.

I cannot express how much I would respect George Lucas if he were to just stand up out of the directors seat, hand the pen and paper to someone a little more capable, and say, `Here you go, please, make me proud.'  It almost makes me wish someone would slap him on the back of the head and tell him to ask for directions already, cause Georgy boy is as lost as you can get.  These movies have such potential, they have so much to offer us.  Can't we just get the movie so promised to us?  It's almost as if Mr. Lucas is thinking, well, there is no way that this movie will not make a zillion dollars so I can go ahead and write what I want and that way I get to do it all myself.  &#145;Episode II-Attack of the Clones' takes place 10 years after the last POS we all waited on line to see 3 years ago, &#145;The Phantom Menace'.  Queen Padme' Amidala (Natalie Portman) is now a senator (and still single??), Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen, &#145;Life as a House') is now a grown up (in appearance only mind you, I don't know who whines more, him or my 3 ½ year old!) hotty with an ego only Padme' can love.

I'd taped the original Home Alone, 2 and a half weeks earlier so now I'd get to have both!

As if Kevin's parent didn't learn their lesson from last year, they again lose him! Well, at least they didn't leave him home. Kevin gets separated at the airport. Not that he minds, the night before he said he wanted a vacation all by himself! Now, he's got it and what fun he has in the big apple. After ringing up a huge bill at the Plaza Hotel he goes shopping for toys. Now if you've heard anything at all bout this film you know sooner or later Kevin will meet his pals from the first film. Well, turns out Harry and Marv broke out of prison and are in New York. In a city with millions of people what are the odds they'd meet? In this film, pretty good! I'm amazed that when they do see him there hardly even surprised! And after the beating the took from little Kevin in the first film, You would think they would be the ones to scream and run away from that little bundel of Misery well, anyways Kevin gets away but he later finds out the Sticky Bandits (as their now called) are gonna rob the same toy store Kevin went to. Well, thats going to far right? I think so.Lucky for Kevin, his uncle has an old abandoned apartment nearby. This place is perfect! I'd suppose Kevin couldn't ask for a better place to set traps! Its got holes, paint cans, staple guns, electric generators, gallons of gasoline and kerosine, tool chests, and all this slimy stuff! What ensues makes the poor burglars wish they had stayed in prison! In the end, those poor dudes are dropped from a flaming rope, 4 stories onto a concrete floor, then hit by a dozen paint cans!

So I got back just in time to see Kevin get reunited with his disfunctional family and then get screamed at FOR SPENDING 967 DOLLARS ON ROOM SERVICE! Great film. Mac just about reached his best in this film (he was perfect in The Good Son which was his last Good Film!) Wonderful music by John Williams as usual and well, All around a fun film to watch and as I found out, if your car is on a wrecker being towed to the nearest junk yard it'll put you in a good mood!!!!!

A 2nd viewing will probably clear things up, but I'm still a little unclear on Count Dooku, where he came from, and how creating clones helps Senator Palpatine.  I THINK it's because Palpatine is using the clones are needed to protect the Republic argument, when he actually plans to use them to overthrow it.  I have a feeling a Special Edition will come out in the future with new scenes and new editing to make this movie more comprehensible.  If so, I hope they throw in some scenes to make Anakin more appealing.  And I'd gladly throw away some of the high tech special f\/x for better characters, truer emotions, and a more comprehensible plotline.I'm going to go see it again.  That helped with The Lord of the Rings, which was a much finer movie.  Although, even THAT wasn't quite up to the original Star Wars and Empire (forget the Jedi furball fiasco).  Note to George if Lawrence Kasdan and Irwin Kershner are still alive, let THEM handle the 3rd flick!  Heck, even if they AREN'T alive, let them handle it! I was between my junior and senior year in high school when Star Wars first came out, and I can tell you from experience and seeing audience reactions that neither one of these new episodes comes close to measuring up to the first 2 movies in this series (SW and TESB).  People walked out of those movies in awe of what they had just seen.  If these movies were as good, they would easily surpass Titanic in theatre grosses.  6 out of 10.Oh yeah Yoda kickin butt was almost worth the price of admission!  THAT was cool!  ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"20 May 2002","score":"","review":"  Star Wars. The name is practically a mandatory addition to modern man's vocabulary. After the huge breakthroughs the original Trilogy made in sci-fi movies, fans have been screaming for more. It wasn't until Episode I came out that their appetite has been whetted. And while it was a worthy addition to the Star Wars saga, there were a lot of people who were disgruntled with the less-than-great acting on the part of Anakin, and the ok-at-first-but-quickly-becoming-annoying Jar Jar Binks. It undeniably didn't do for movies today what the original Star Wars did back in 1977. Personally, however, I enjoyed the movie and wasn't too disappointed. Well, Episode II has come out and it is clear to me that George Lucas has learned from some of his mistakes in Phantom Menace and turned out an amazing and very entertaining movie that should please both die-hard Star Wars fans and the casual movie-goer. While it certainly has a different feel than did the originals, since hardly a frame goes by that isn't 95% computer generated, it is still Star Wars and a movie that is not to be missed.I'm assuming you have seen the other four Star Wars movies before you read this and see AOTC. If not, climb out of the rock you've been living under and head to Blockbuster before you see this movie. Ok, with that said, let me now say *SPOILER ALERT*. The next couple paragraphs will talk about the storyline, so I recommend you skip over this if you haven't seen it yet. Ok, after Episode I where the Trade Federation has been almost completely taken down and Naboo is freed from Federation control, in Episode II the Trade Federation leaders and some other solar systems have left the Republic and are building for themselves a massive droid army on the planet Geonosis. Geonosis is one of the several new locales to AOTC and is a bug-filled rock where the dissidents are hiding out. Count Dooku who was on the Jedi Council is in league with all these guys and knows the truth about Palpatine while being in league with Sidious. Oh yeah, and Jango Fett is kind of Dooku's bodyguard (and we see that his Slave 1 is an awesome, tricked-out ship capable of taking anybody but a Jedi out). Anyway, Obi-Wan and Anakin get chosen to protect Senator Amidala (she's not Queen anymore), something that Anakin is more than happy to do. Eventually, they get leads on a bounty hunter who's been making attempts at taking Padme Amidala's life, so Obi-Wan tries to find out more about him while Anakin and Padme head off to Naboo to go into hiding until the threats are eliminated. Obi-Wan eventually goes off to a hidden planet called Kamino (very awesome) and finds a Clone army being made, with the clones being modeled after the very bounty hunter that's been trying to kill Amidala - Jango Fett. Obi-Wan follows Jango to Geonosis and finds out about Dooku and everybody else. Unfortunately, he gets captured.Meanwhile, Anakin and Padme are getting to know each other while in hiding on Naboo. Both are obviously getting to really like each other, but then Anakin has a dream about his mother in pain. He and Padme go off to Tatooine to find Shmi. This takes us back to the ever-amusing junk dealer Watto. He tells Anakin that Shmi was bought by a guy named Cliegg Lars, who freed her and married her. Anakin visits his new step-Dad to find him a very nice guy who just lost his wife to the sand people. Anakin meets his step-brother Owen, who is dating Beru (now where have we heard those names before...?). Anakin finds the sand people and his captive mother. After some parting words, Anakin's mother dies and Anakin gets enraged at the sand people. He kills their entire camp and returns to his new family's house. They bury Shmi and Anakin goes back to his ship. There he finds out that Obi-Wan's in trouble and together he and Padme go to rescue Obi-Wan. Things don't go so smoothly and between Padme almost getting roasted and Anakin nearly being turned into a droid, the two are finally captured and they meet Obi-Wan in a gladiator-type arena where they are about to be executed, Roman style (with an outer-space twist). Some amusing and exciting parts follow (with our friends C-3P0 and R2-D2 in the mix), as well as an epic battle scene complete with the early incarnation of Storm Troopers and quite a few light saber-wielding Jedi. Finally, a really impressive scene where we get to really respect (and ooh and aah) at the capabilities of the limping little green guy (Yoda) follows, which pretty much finishes the movie off. Of course Ian McDiarmid is there as Palpatine, and his descent into evil is made more apparent in this movie. *SPOILER END*.Ok, enough about the plot. If you thought Episode I was full of CG scenes and locales, Episode II is even fuller. From the sweet CG ocean and rain of Kamino to the waterfalls of Naboo to the bustling city on Coruscant, AOTC is full of wow factor. If you thought the podrace of Phantom Menace was cool, wait until you see Anakin fly the hover car on Coruscant. Or Obi-Wan's personal ship, complete with long range hookup for traveling from star system to star system. Or the Slave 1, or... you get the idea. Your jaw will drop at the amazing climactic battle, as well as the fully computer generated bug-like creatures from Geonosis. And the alien chef who Obi-Wan talks to is awesome and quite amusing. Add to all this the fact that AOTC is (I think) the first mainstream made-for-theater feature to be filmed completely with digital cameras, instead of the analog film ones that have been used ever since the beginning of movies. This fact plus all the just plain awesome computer work on Episode II means one thing...absolutely top quality of production. Ok, now to acting. Now, first remember that people don't go to see Star Wars to see incredible emotional performances on the part of the cast (that's what movies like Cast Away are for). First and foremost it's for the awesome spaceships, planets, and aliens. The new Star Wars episodes are clearly more effect and less impressive acting performances (no more Harrison Ford to make us laugh), but that's not to say the acting is bad. I'm no professional critic, but I thought the performances were just fine, on the whole. No butchered lines like in the last movie (remember this is tense, sand storms are very, very dangerous, and lets try spinning, that's a good trick). The characters this time around are older and more mature and aren't quite so laughable (ok, I know Jake Lloyd was a little kid, so I'll cut him some slack, but what about Jar Jar?). Jar Jar was the thorn in many Star Wars fans' side for the duration of Episode I. Personally, I didn't mind him too much. But this time he's been given a much smaller part, reminding you that he's still there and important, but not filling the movie with his antics. A good thing to be sure. Hayden Christensen does a surprisingly good job, as does Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman (and pretty much everybody else, for that matter). All in all, George Lucas certainly doesn't have the budget problem he did for Star Wars A New Hope, and he's produced a very impressive and amazing sci-fi film.As for content acceptability, Mr. Lucas has been thankfully keeping his movies PG. I don't mind so much PG-13 violence, but once the Star Wars universe starts getting mature themes included is when it's no longer Star Wars and I'll no longer be much of a fan. Thankfully, this is not the case and Lucas clearly aims to keep the PG rating universal for all his movies. Thank you, Mr. Lucas! Ok, as you know there's laser battles, light saber duals (a couple people lose various limbs, and one guy loses his head in a very non-gory manner...the fact that light sabers burn you makes it possible for saber wounds to be very clean), etc. As is expected, Star Wars is full of mild and non-bloody violence. Lots of it, but what's there isn't a big deal. This movie has Natalie Portman wearing a bit less, but nothing to be worried about. The romance between Amidala and Anakin is kept non-physical, and is limited to occasional kissing scenes. There are a few skimpily dressed women at a Coruscant club, but nothing much is shown and it shouldn't be an issue. The gladiator scene might be a bit scary for younger kids, as there are some big, possibly scary creatures as well as Amidala gets her back slashed. Finally, the Geonosis bugs are a bit on the nasty side. Nothing serious, but maybe a few issues for parents of small children, not to mention the overall suspenseful nature of the movie.In conclusion, I thought Lucas did a much better job this time around. The kiddish characters are gone, and the movie takes itself more seriously. There is probably the most wow factor in this movie as in any of the Star Wars movies (and any movie for that matter except perhaps the Matrix or something). The CG is absolutely incredible, and the new ships and locales are very awesome. It's not the same as the original Trilogy, but nothing ever will be. That doesn't mean it's not a great movie in its own right, however. Star Wars Attack of the Clones is the coolest movie I've seen in a long time, and a downright great continuation of the Star Wars saga. See it today. Oh, and one more thing... Yoda rocks!Entertainment Value 9.5. Awesome locales and unforgettable battles make this movie the first of the prequels to really show that Lucas is still a great writer\/director and that Star Wars is still as cool as ever. Edge-of-your-seat, entertaining, and very, very cool.Quality of Production & Acting 9.5. That same wow factor I was talking about earlier. Incredible CG all the way. Acting is perfectly fine, not necessarily stellar, but it certainly gets the job done. All-in-all, great.Storyline 9.0. The continuing saga of Star Wars, how can you go wrong? Though everybody pretty much knows what's gonna happen, it's still cool to see everything fit together to set the stage for the Trilogy we all know and love.Content Acceptability 8.75. Star Wars non-gory and non-bloody violence. Very minor female immodesty in a club, but nothing to worry about. Of course absolutely no bad language - this is a long time ago in a galaxy far away for crying out loud!Final Critique (not an average) 9.5. Lucas is back! Much better than Episode I, a great romp through the Star Wars universe. Very cool, entertaining, and there's a little something for everybody.

He's at his best when he's playing the naive sap (Mr. Smith, Destry, Harvey), the everyday man (Made for each other, Philadelphia story), or the straight nose who is thrust into unusual situations (this film, You Can't Take it with you) where he can play off of what's happening to him.  His weaker performances, I felt, were in his straight forward dramatic roles (liberty valance, man who knew too much, even Vertigo).  This film is a chance to see his everyman thrust into wacky situations.  This film is a little too tame to be considered screwball, but as with any good screwball, the supporting cast is as important as the leads.  Elsa Lanchester, AKA Bride of Frankenstein, is hilarious.  Ernie Kovacs, as Sidney Redlitch, is an absolute riot.

In the tradition of their masterpiece Fargo, this movie also depicts a simple plan that just goes totally wrong. It all starts with a plan to obtain money, and ends up with murder, unexpected twists, and unraveling tension. Although The Man Who Wasn't There does not go as deep as Fargo does, I still very much enjoyed its well-written story and excellent cinematography. The title is very appropriate to Billy Bob Thornton's Ed Crane, a barber who seems aloof to the world around him. `I don't talk much; I just cut the hair,' he claims, and its true, all he does is stare and smoke his cigarette. He is married to Doris (Frances McDormand), and he knows she is having an affair with her boss, Big Dave (James Gandolfini). Unfortunately, Ed Crane couldn't care less about the affair.  When a customer in the barbershop proposes a business deal for $10,000 (for a new invention-dry cleaning), Ed decides to blackmail Dave. He sends him a blackmail letter, asking for $10,000 or else the affair will be revealed to Dave's wife, Ed himself, and everybody else. Because he is a respected member of the community and wants to gain control of his wife's business, Dave has no choice. This is good news for Ed. Except there's one problem Dave knows about the man with the dry cleaning idea.Using black and white cinematography and simple camera angles, the Coen brothers have produced simplistic shots that are reminiscent of old movies. I don't know if the movie will also look good if shot in color, but I enjoyed it the way it is. I also have no idea why it was shot in black in white. Is it because of one sequence where a man bleeds to death, or was it because it is a film noir? Nonetheless, I'm sure the director had his reasons, and I did enjoy the black and white atmosphere.Billy Bob Thornton shows development as a very versatile actor. I also admired his performance in Monster's Ball as a racist prison guard who falls in love with a black woman. He displays his versatility by playing a bank robber in a comedy Bandits, which although I have not seen, the few trailer scenes probably tell it all. But I think his portrayal of Ed Crane is his best performance of the year. He manages to look the same and aloof all the time, even in times when great emotion is needed. This performance fit the character perfectly; he convincingly portrays the man who wasn't there.As I mentioned earlier, The Man Who Wasn't There does not go as deep as Fargo does in terms of the characters and the insight to the human condition. But The Man Who Wasn't There is perfect in its own little way. I was captivated by its story development all the way through.

Richard Gere comes off a serious person and his acting is perfect, which I wasn't expecting at all.  The film was very well made and ended on a note I thought was much more sincere than anything I've seen in movies recently.  The dialogue and plot took me two sittings to absorb.Having said that, I gotta admit, people will hate this film.  Like most Altman pieces, the plot is not driven by outside events so much as it's driven by how characters feel and act towards each other.  Dr. T is a rather extreme example of this, where almost nothing happens but the spectacular collapse of a wedding, a failed relationship, and a short-story magic ending.  The arc of the plot is the growth of the Richard Gere character from a needy person who has been unconsciously trying to make himself the center of a kingdom of dependent women into a person who finds new meaning in his work with people.  Dr. T begins the movie as a man who is perfectly happy.  He's an overwhelming professional success with an attractive family and nothing but more of expensive happiness to look forward to.  But he's immersed in demanding women.  He has spent his whole life trying to put women on pedestals so that he can bask in their praise and affection.  This isn't exactly evil, but the movie shows how his life begins to unravel as a result of this basically sexist outlook he has devoted his life to.  After what must have been decades of relentless smothering, his wife reverts to a childlike state.  (An expensive psychiatrist assures him that it's from having a life that's `too perfect,' which is probably a way of telling him what's wrong without saying exactly why.)  His heroic efforts as an OB\/GYN have led his patients to make unreasonable demands on him that make his job a hell.  He appears to have gotten the needs of his daughters backwards as far as which one requires more attention.  His time-bomb sister-in-law has moved into his home with her gaggle of little girls.  Just as all of this comes apart, he runs into a woman from outside Dr. T's kingdom.  Helen Hunt plays a woman who doesn't need him and won't let herself rely on his courtesies and affections.  He tells her frankly that he's never met any woman like her, which is a sad thing really.  Then it all falls apart and in his lowest moment he's wrenched away from the mess he's made of his life by a tornado out of The Wizard of Oz (people can believe in Yoda, clips of ammo that never empty, accept a deluge of frogs from the sky, and that a man can be just a little jarred after shooting himself in the head to kill Tyler Durden, but a magic tornado is too much&#133;)  Dr. T finds himself without his expensive status symbols or his dependent entourage of hypochondriacs, in a place without even a phone.  He does his job and he doesn't even get a girl.  It's a boy and it's all new to him and that fills him with joy.There are other Altman traits will drive people up the wall - the plot that feels like sprawl the first time through, the lack of signposts to obviously sympathetic characters, insistence on sorting moral ambiguities, doing satire in a PC world where even the shopping classes can't be made fun of, the layers of dialogue and so on.  What I try to tell people that are new to Altman is that he pretty much invented the TV drama forms we respect.  E.R. and Hill Street Blues and any number of TV dramas thrive off Altman's formula - which is to pick an interesting locale, drop a ton of characters in, and set them in motion.  Events happen, but the real drama is watching the characters interact every week.  The Hollywood film industry has moved in the opposite direction, which is soap opera.  There you take a big cast of canned personalities, drop them in an upper income setting and write some love story or coming-of-age bit around the quest\/monsters\/gun fights that actually make them move from scene to scene.  Neither is inherently better, but the multiplex has gravitated towards the second so completely that most people are utterly confused when seeing the first.Unless you're interested in seeing a movie about a man who is forced to change the values he built his life on with the best intentions, you'll hate it.  If you dig seeing that dramatized, Dr. T is fairly unique.Also, I wish Altman had some pull with whoever is doing the advertising for his films.  Marketing Dr. T as a screwball comedy and Gosford Park as a whodunit has probably done more damage to his reputation than anything else.  Illiterate marketing is almost as big a problem as trailers that give the best parts of movies away - I wish the studios would be a little more thoughtful about it.

This isn't exactly evil, but the movie shows how his life begins to unravel as a result of this basically sexist outlook he has devoted his life to.  After what must have been decades of relentless smothering, his wife reverts to a childlike state.  (An expensive psychiatrist assures him that it's from having a life that's `too perfect,' which is probably a way of telling him what's wrong without saying exactly why.)  His heroic efforts as an OB\/GYN have led his patients to make unreasonable demands on him that make his job a hell.  He appears to have gotten the needs of his daughters backwards as far as which one requires more attention.  His time-bomb sister-in-law has moved into his home with her gaggle of little girls.  Just as all of this comes apart, he runs into a woman from outside Dr. T's kingdom.  Helen Hunt plays a woman who doesn't need him and won't let herself rely on his courtesies and affections.  He tells her frankly that he's never met any woman like her, which is a sad thing really.  Then it all falls apart and in his lowest moment he's wrenched away from the mess he's made of his life by a tornado out of The Wizard of Oz (people can believe in Yoda, clips of ammo that never empty, accept a deluge of frogs from the sky, and that a man can be just a little jarred after shooting himself in the head to kill Tyler Durden, but a magic tornado is too much&#133;)  Dr. T finds himself without his expensive status symbols or his dependent entourage of hypochondriacs, in a place without even a phone.  He does his job and he doesn't even get a girl.  It's a boy and it's all new to him and that fills him with joy.There are other Altman traits will drive people up the wall - the plot that feels like sprawl the first time through, the lack of signposts to obviously sympathetic characters, insistence on sorting moral ambiguities, doing satire in a PC world where even the shopping classes can't be made fun of, the layers of dialogue and so on.  What I try to tell people that are new to Altman is that he pretty much invented the TV drama forms we respect.  E.R. and Hill Street Blues and any number of TV dramas thrive off Altman's formula - which is to pick an interesting locale, drop a ton of characters in, and set them in motion.  Events happen, but the real drama is watching the characters interact every week.  The Hollywood film industry has moved in the opposite direction, which is soap opera.  There you take a big cast of canned personalities, drop them in an upper income setting and write some love story or coming-of-age bit around the quest\/monsters\/gun fights that actually make them move from scene to scene.  Neither is inherently better, but the multiplex has gravitated towards the second so completely that most people are utterly confused when seeing the first.Unless you're interested in seeing a movie about a man who is forced to change the values he built his life on with the best intentions, you'll hate it.  If you dig seeing that dramatized, Dr. T is fairly unique.Also, I wish Altman had some pull with whoever is doing the advertising for his films.  Marketing Dr. T as a screwball comedy and Gosford Park as a whodunit has probably done more damage to his reputation than anything else.  Illiterate marketing is almost as big a problem as trailers that give the best parts of movies away - I wish the studios would be a little more thoughtful about it.

Richard Gere comes off a serious person and his acting is perfect, which I wasn't expecting at all.  The film was very well made and ended on a note I thought was much more sincere than anything I've seen in movies recently.  The dialogue and plot took me two sittings to absorb.Having said that, I gotta admit, people will hate this film.  Like most Altman pieces, the plot is not driven by outside events so much as it's driven by how characters feel and act towards each other.  Dr. T is a rather extreme example of this, where almost nothing happens but the spectacular collapse of a wedding, a failed relationship, and a short-story magic ending.  The arc of the plot is the growth of the Richard Gere character from a needy person who has been unconsciously trying to make himself the center of a kingdom of dependent women into a person who finds new meaning in his work with people.  Dr. T begins the movie as a man who is perfectly happy.  He's an overwhelming professional success with an attractive family and nothing but more of expensive happiness to look forward to.

Its not exactly plot-heavy going in, but becomes shockingly boring and really stupid by the end. The 'sweethearts' in question are bitchy Zeta-Jones and down-to-earth Cusack, who've broken up and that has upset the American public and worse than that, has upset the studio heads about to release their next picture.  Both of them really need a hit, too.  The director on their movie, Christopher Walken, is a nutjob, and will not release a copy of the movie to the studio heads but instead will reveal it at a press junket (that would happen!) that the stars are attending.  So the entire movie is set at this press junket, which is not running well to say the least.  There is no movie to screen and the sweethearts are not that sweet.  Word is not good. Movie is not that insulting, its just very light on its feet.  Its not funny but not corny or stupid either.  Then the last 1\/2 hour is incredibly dumb and a lot to have to tolerate.  Confessions happen in front of the entire press corp.  Not a chance in the world.  The movie is a disaster but the press loves it.  Again, no way.  Cusack is better than the material.  He looks like he dreaded being there.  Billy Crystal is good and in many ways holds the movie together until even he gives up and just wants it to be over with.  Zeta-Jones has the spoiled-brat routine down pat, but that's all her character is.  Julia Roberts as the put-upon assistant does nothing special either.  Really likable actors like Stanley Tucci, Hank Azaria and Seth Green are wasted.  Christopher Walken is having some fun but he has limited screen time too.2\/10.  Would have been a disappointment if I were expecting anything in the first place, which I wasn't.  No movie-makers that would give that Oscar nazi Julia Roberts a job get a ton of respect from me, Soderbergh notwithstanding.

While it is a good idea to judge movies by your own standards, sometimes you can avoid stinkers by listening to what the critics specifically dislike and like. And, of course, if their dislikes are similar to yours, you can follow their lead.Here are comments from some critics, followed by my own assessment1. The acting is horrible.This is true, somewhat. Of all of the lead actors, only Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi) is at least passable; Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker) and Natalie Portman (Senator Padme Amidala) are both pretty awful. McGregor seems to be playing Alec Guinness (who, of course, originated the role in 1977's Star Wars), and this has been perceived as a knock on him. Personally, I think it was the wise way to go. We all know that Obi-Wan dies in Star Wars (Episode IV), so what McGregor was trying to do was kind of morph into Guinness, to make it easier for us to take the transformation from McGregor in the upcoming Episode III to Guinness in Episode IV.Christensen, at first glance, seems woefully miscast and overmatched. One of the knocks on him is that he just comes off as your typical teenager (in the movie, he's 15). The critics sometimes fail to remember that Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker in Star Wars was just as petulant and moody, so this is more of a character issue than an actor issue. However, Christensen's line readings are atrocious, and some of the writing of his character is banal. In one scene, for example, he rails against Obi-Wan to Senator Amidala - how he's underappreciated by Obi-Wan, how he doesn't get to do nuffin, and so on. Real fascinating stuff - not. And the scene drags on a bit too long, making the character move from gritty angst to just plain obnoxiousness. Of course, bear in mind that Anakin does grow up to be the evil Darth Vader, and the lad's fits of pique are George Lucas's way of showing us how he's already struggling with the Dark Side of the Force.Portman was excellent in Episode 1, but she's completely flat in this one. Sometimes people unfairly compare her character to Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Fisher brought spice to the character, whereas Portman brings a more regal attitude. Yes, she's a can-do Senator (formerly Queen, don't ask how). Bringing different things to the table is fine, but again - remember that Amidala will be Leia's mother, so some of the virtues found in Leia should appear, you would think, in Amidala (and in Anakin). In addition, the chemistry between Christensen and Portman is completely nonexistent. You'd find more sexual vibes between a nun and a eunuch. This is definitely the result of bad casting - your lovers HAVE to appear to love each other, and they were very unconvincing. I could see the audience wincing each time Anakin and Amidala began to talk in that low voice that's supposed to essay passion. Snore!Samuel L. Jackson, who plays Jedi Master Mace Windu, gets a much larger role here than he had in Episode I, and he even gets to kick ass, himself. Great to see Sam wielding a purple lightsaber! One of his generation's greatest actors - and is anyone saying he's slumming? Hell, no. Was Alec Guinness slumming? Or Peter Cushing? Or the indomitable Christopher Lee (interesting note in the past several months, Lee has appeared in two of the highest-grossing films, both epics, Attack of the Clones and Lord of the Rings, playing characters that are disturbingly similar)? Sam Jackson rocks. He just plain rocks.2. It's poorly written.I can't agree with this assessment - I thought it was pretty well written. One benefit to seeing the first trilogy after the second is that we can see origins more clearly If X happens in Episode II, we know that explains Y in Episode IV. I liked a lot of the little details - the beginnings of Boba Fett, for example. And if you look hard, you'll see Greedo from the first Star Wars in there, too.3. It's FX-driven.It sure is, and I'm glad it was. Now, when Star Wars came out, everyone was all agog over the effects, because there had never been anything like it before, and the movie showed a long-distant vision of the future. But here in 2003, we've seen a lot of space movies and a lot of not-so-special effects. The novelty's worn off a little, and we're not as enthralled. But don't get me wrong, the effects in this movie are excellent; they're just not unique anymore. (Still, as one critic noted, the ship that's bringing Amidala to the conference sounds like it's running on propellers... what's up with that??)Of course, in lieu of a million space fights, we get a lot of lightsaber-play. If you remember your Jedi history, all of the Jedi were wiped out during the Clone Wars (Obi-Wan explains this to Luke in Star Wars). This movie leads right up to those wars, and many of the Jedi in this movie don't make it through to the end. But man, while they're around - lots of great fights. In fact, the greatest Jedi of them all, Yoda, gets to kick ass, something that could never be done in 1977, or 1980, or 1983. In fact, the scene pitting Yoda against the evil Count Dooka (Christopher Lee) is magnificent, almost worth the admission on its own.At any rate, although the movie is loaded with effects, that's not the only reason we're watching. The truth is, many of us have bought into the mythos of Star Wars, and dammit, we care about these characters.

Good. Frustrated? Bad. Looking for more? Great. And that's where Attack of the Clones, despite its Grade-Z subtitle, succeeds magnificently.

Bullock, as usual, delivers an awsome performance. She plays here typical part (girl with relationship problems) and manages to match the character pretty well. Her character Casey supposedly gets men in a relationship to avoid feeling rejected and then pushes them away before they even get the chance to reject her.The storyline was also pretty good. It is quite thrilling at parts even though you know from the beginning who the murderer is. Bullock plays the detective who is on to the criminal from the beginning. Her task is to prove to her boss, who thinks that she is losing her touch, that she is right.The story does take some unexpected turns in the end. As the movie progresses you learn more about Bullock's past life and why she even became a cop. That part of the story proves to be an interesting side plot.Overall, good movie. I wouldn't say it's a must see, but if you do get the chance, I think you will find it to be mostly entertaining and fun to watch.
