There are a couple of small aspects of the film that don't work as perfectly as the rest, but those parts are hardly noticeable. What Huston has made is the first true film noir, complete with a troubled hero, the femme fatale whom he falls for, and an assortment of seedy international criminals. Dynamic camera angles and close-ups turn what would be routine melodrama into pure suspense. My only complaint pertains to the film's ending, which, if it had been done any other way, would have been more memorable. When people recall how great Falcon is, I doubt the ending is the first part of the scene that comes to mind. After going through the film shot by shot, I have a greater appreciation for just how innovative The Maltese Falcon really is. What makes the film so enjoyable is its many great performances. Humphrey Bogart plays Sam Spade, a determined private investigator, and Mary Astor plays the deadly Brigid O'Shaughnessy. The criminals are played by brilliant character actors Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Elisha Cook, Jr. The former two would appear alongside Bogart again the following year in the legendary Casablanca (1942). All of these actors give great performances with subtle nuances that make each viewing a new experience.

If that's all you remember after viewing it? Some more life experience is coming your way in a situation near you. In blazing Technicolor. There are actually two leading ladies in this film. Neither were Dorothy McGuire. She did her best, and it was a satisfactory performance. She was out shined. Gregory Peck, his son Tommy (Dean Stockwell of Quantum Leap fame), and his mother, played by Anne Revere (a direct descendant of Paul Revere) all performed so well in constructing a family that the viewer feels the depth of their characters. So, who's the two leading ladies? Anne Revere as his mother and Celeste Holm, who plays Anne, the Fashion Editor and co worker. Celeste rips up every scene she is in, building her performance into a tense crescendo by her final scene. Many of her lines are classic and definitely qualify for memorable quotes. She was gifted the best part in this movie. Anne Revere is brilliant as his mother, and her final scene is one of the best I've ever seen committed to film. What I gleaned from the undertone of this movie and what I think is the second and equally important lesson is this How do you tell those you love and are close friends with the truth about themselves. What happens when you, who's opinion they value, tell the blunt, honest truth. Where is that precise moment when the mirror they see themselves in turns inwards and forces them to SEE themselves as they truly are? What is their reaction when they remove the rose tinted glasses, only to be pricked by the thorny truth? THAT is what makes this movie an under rated gem and not an overblown one. Turn your mirror inward. If you can see it, learn from it. If you cannot, tint those glasses a wee bit more. Life goes on either way. BUT. Does that make you less of a person? Some movies have layers that can illuminate, amaze, and astound. THAT fact is what makes this movie a true CLASSIC.

Not only we have memorable characters here, but also a very inventive way of storytelling and a brilliant ending.

I really liked how Kubrick constantly goes back and forth in time, in order to demonstrate each character's assignment and how everything must happen with precise and flawless execution. You really feel how important and crucial they are for the heist to go according to plan. Another great aspect of the film is that the director takes his time to show everyone's motivations behind the robbery, building a nice character development for them. My favorites of the bunch would have to be Maurice Oboukhoff and Johnny Clay. The first one is a professional wrestler who is both cerebral and humorous, having a mesmerizing fight scene, which is just raw and awesome. The latter is the mastermind crook behind the whole scheme, who meticulously plans the robbery and is always charismatic, cautious and intimidating. Finally, without spoiling anything, the final scene really made an impact on me because it contradicts with everything Clay's character is. The Killing is one of Kubrick's early efforts and a splendid crime film. A must-see for everyone who appreciates the genre.

An unsolved crime at the beginning, the film drops from a whodunit detective story rather early, after the a short spell of foreign sojourn (Lake Como, where else would be more romantic?), the newly-weds returns to London, for Paula (Bergman), the scar dooms to be lifted open and the bare wound is even more deleterious than she could ever imagine. Adapted from Patrick Hamilton's play ANGEL STREET, the film predominantly is a two-hander between Paula and Gregory (Boyer), and about how Gregory punctiliously and effectively manipulates and impairs Paula's mental state, he ensnares Paulo into a self-doubt of her sanity (the very first outing in London is to visit the torture chamber, no wonder all the Museums of Torture are prevailing in the touristic attractions here in Europe), insulating her from meeting other people, trapped her in the mansion and slowly yet mercilessly infuses all the hallucinogenic chicanery to further damage her flimsy nerve, which includes the titular gaslight and it also serves as a signpost of his surreptitious whereabout every night. Boyer is quite extraordinary in expressing venom under his high-and-mighty politeness, frowning and pouting, his devilish complexion enlivens the film's watchability even at its corniest part, a bestial man indeed, but a tour-de-force exemplar of his kind. Bergman, although is the hapless victim who is unwittingly sleeping with the enemy, very anti-femme- fatale indeed, manages to deliver a visceral transition of Paula's trauma, which certainly out of her usual graceful and elegant comfort zone, and albeit her Nordic height, it is such a stretch for her to reveal her female vulnerability without any reservation. She got her first Oscar for the film, I'm now wavering in choosing my pick between her and Barbara Stanwyck in Billy Wilder's noir paradigm DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944, 8\/10).A third-billed Joseph Cotten is the cardboard detective eventually will be the hero, and Dame May Witty, the garrulous busybody, appears sporadically in case she overstays her welcome. The film is also Angela Lansbury's film debut, at the age of 17 during the shoot, the young flighty maid might only be a pawn in the plot, but a rather singular boldness and an Oscar nomination presages her reverend orbit as one of the most versatile character-actress in the Hollywood history. Overall, the film is a highly-recommendable piece of psychological study, shot in minimal bleakness (even the gala concert is intentionally shortened) with solemn and choppy original score from Bronislau Kaper. From a modern-day POV, one might find Paula is a stereotyped exploitation about how women usually are portrayed in the yesteryear, which seems out of topicality now (not domestic violence, just the showcase of female's utter dependence and extreme delicacy), so, it might undermine the reception from the younger generation, but anyway, at least, a big bravo to Bergman and Boyer.

And I have always been a sucker for a treasure hunt story. It didn't matter that the film was considered to be a big overblown failure; a ridiculous attempt at a western epic, the kind of film that was going out of favor with moviegoers when it was released in 1969.I will gladly concede to the critics that everything they say is wrong with MACKENNA'S GOLD is valid the script meanders; most of the acting is over the top; interesting characters wander into the action and then are promptly disposed of for no good reason; the whole thing runs too long.None of that matters, because MACKENNA'S GOLD is just plain fun; even after all these years. It was made by the same duo that gave us THE GUNS OF NAVARONE producer Carl Foreman and director J. Lee Thompson, and if they did not recapture the greatness of that earlier classic, it was not for want of trying.Like NAVARONE, MACKENNA'S GOLD is a about a mission, but this time the mission is to find a mythical valley of gold hidden away in the badlands of the Southwest and guarded by fearsome Apaches. The plot concerns a motley group of various and sundry individuals who brave the dangers and each other to find a fortune. Gregory Peck (who was in NAVARONE) is Marshall Sam MacKenna, the only man who knows where to find the valley; he's being forced by the outlaw Colorado, played by Omar Sharif, to lead him and his gang there. Along the way, they pick up and discard a collection of greedy fools all driven to forsake their homes by the lure of gold.This group includes Telly Savalas as a treacherous Army Sergeant; Eli Wallach as a store keeper; Raymond Massey as a preacher; Lee J. Cobb as a newspaper editor; Edward G. Robinson as a blind old man who saw the gold when he was young; Anthony Quayle (another veteran of NAVARONE) as a traveling English gentleman; Keenan Wynn as a bandit. Add to them, Julie Newmar and Ted Cassidy as Apaches and Camilla Sparv as a hostage taken captive by Colorado. Everyone, except for Peck and Sparv (who naturally fall in love along the way) are driven by the dream of getting rich instantly, and before it's over, even those two will succumb to the itch for gold.Besides the cast, what makes MACKENNA'S GOLD so memorable? The great location scenes, some of them shot in the legendary Monument Valley. The sequence at the deep water desert spring, where villains Newmar and Sharif go skinny dipping while Peck, ever the hero, dives in with his clothes on. The laughable miscasting of Arabs and Italians as Mexicans and American Indians (The great Eduardo Ciannelli as Prairie Dog); the equally great Victor Jory's narration. Ted Cassidy and his awesome voice. Telly Savalas in one of his best bad guys roles after THE DIRTY DOZEN. Jose Feliciano's rendition of the unforgettable theme song, Old Turkey Buzzard (with music by Quincy Jones). Did I mention Julie Newmar swims in the nude? And then tries to drown Sparv because she has a thing for Peck? The way Peck plays Mackenna like it's still 1958 and he's in THE BIG COUNTRY and working for William Wyler, while the rest of the cast hams it up. Even little things like the sound effects of rifle fire echoing off the canyon walls stick in the mind.If the ambition of MACKENNA'S GOLD was to be a serious commentary on human greed, then it fell short. But in its own way, it went somewhere better into the hearts of legions of fans who don't care that it's not THE WILD BUNCH, TRUE GRIT or ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, three classics westerns that came out the same year that MACKENNA'S GOLD was released. And if Quentin Tarantino is looking for a follow up to DJANGO UNCHAINED, I'd suggest he dust off the screenplay for MAKENNA'S GOLD. It has a lot of possibilities.

","genre":"Adventure, Romance, Western"},{"date":"9 May 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I first saw MACKENNA'S GOLD on TV when I was a kid and loved it; to me it was the perfect mix of the western and adventure genres. And I have always been a sucker for a treasure hunt story. It didn't matter that the film was considered to be a big overblown failure; a ridiculous attempt at a western epic, the kind of film that was going out of favor with moviegoers when it was released in 1969.I will gladly concede to the critics that everything they say is wrong with MACKENNA'S GOLD is valid the script meanders; most of the acting is over the top; interesting characters wander into the action and then are promptly disposed of for no good reason; the whole thing runs too long.None of that matters, because MACKENNA'S GOLD is just plain fun; even after all these years. It was made by the same duo that gave us THE GUNS OF NAVARONE producer Carl Foreman and director J. Lee Thompson, and if they did not recapture the greatness of that earlier classic, it was not for want of trying.Like NAVARONE, MACKENNA'S GOLD is a about a mission, but this time the mission is to find a mythical valley of gold hidden away in the badlands of the Southwest and guarded by fearsome Apaches. The plot concerns a motley group of various and sundry individuals who brave the dangers and each other to find a fortune. Gregory Peck (who was in NAVARONE) is Marshall Sam MacKenna, the only man who knows where to find the valley; he's being forced by the outlaw Colorado, played by Omar Sharif, to lead him and his gang there. Along the way, they pick up and discard a collection of greedy fools all driven to forsake their homes by the lure of gold.This group includes Telly Savalas as a treacherous Army Sergeant; Eli Wallach as a store keeper; Raymond Massey as a preacher; Lee J. Cobb as a newspaper editor; Edward G. Robinson as a blind old man who saw the gold when he was young; Anthony Quayle (another veteran of NAVARONE) as a traveling English gentleman; Keenan Wynn as a bandit. Add to them, Julie Newmar and Ted Cassidy as Apaches and Camilla Sparv as a hostage taken captive by Colorado. Everyone, except for Peck and Sparv (who naturally fall in love along the way) are driven by the dream of getting rich instantly, and before it's over, even those two will succumb to the itch for gold.Besides the cast, what makes MACKENNA'S GOLD so memorable? The great location scenes, some of them shot in the legendary Monument Valley. The sequence at the deep water desert spring, where villains Newmar and Sharif go skinny dipping while Peck, ever the hero, dives in with his clothes on. The laughable miscasting of Arabs and Italians as Mexicans and American Indians (The great Eduardo Ciannelli as Prairie Dog); the equally great Victor Jory's narration. Ted Cassidy and his awesome voice. Telly Savalas in one of his best bad guys roles after THE DIRTY DOZEN. Jose Feliciano's rendition of the unforgettable theme song, Old Turkey Buzzard (with music by Quincy Jones). Did I mention Julie Newmar swims in the nude? And then tries to drown Sparv because she has a thing for Peck? The way Peck plays Mackenna like it's still 1958 and he's in THE BIG COUNTRY and working for William Wyler, while the rest of the cast hams it up. Even little things like the sound effects of rifle fire echoing off the canyon walls stick in the mind.If the ambition of MACKENNA'S GOLD was to be a serious commentary on human greed, then it fell short. But in its own way, it went somewhere better into the hearts of legions of fans who don't care that it's not THE WILD BUNCH, TRUE GRIT or ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, three classics westerns that came out the same year that MACKENNA'S GOLD was released.

","genre":"Adventure, Romance, Western"},{"date":"9 May 2013","score":"","review":" It's a rule of thumb, is it not, for films about vampires and wherein people become vampires to refrain from using the word vampire? Much like zombie movies, no one ever uses the term zombie &#x96; like there was an unwritten rule forbidding them to do so. No one uses the term 'vampire' in Near Dark, a film conforming to traditions and referencing the old guard, not to mention genre demand, while offering something a little fresher with the vampire and blood-letting genre iconography we all recognise. The film is a neat if uneven piece, a film buoyed by the fact its intuitive spin on the vampires is in its depiction of the beasts as somewhat weak, even pathetic. In a genre where vampires have often been powerful, conquering creatures with a desire for world domination on top of their more usual diet of the human liquid interior, these shabby looking (not a cloak in sight) individuals squeeze into battered automobiles and scurry around looking for the sustenance that'll keep them alive for another day. The usual rules regarding sunlight still apply, but don't bet on a fistful of garlic and a crucifix to save you from the beasts Katherine Bigelow depicts here.We don't necessarily begin in a way that would suggest the film is about vampires. Young Caleb Colton (Pasdar) lives a quiet and unassuming life in an isolated town somewhere in warm, dusty America. He has his friends, his family of a father and younger sister on top of his desires to leave for a thousand miles in just about any direction such is the vacant nature of a life around here. Things shift when he meets a young girl his age named Mae (Wright), someone alien to the area who's the object of most of the other young lad's attention; a girl who knows all the star constellations, who has to be home by a certain time for reasons that are not immediately obvious - a girl who's just different. Mae hooks up with Caleb one evening and turns events in both their lives down a different route entirely; for Mae is a vampire - one of the youngest of that aforementioned group of whom travel around trying to keep themselves alive.One assumes vagrants and sex-workers would make for good targets, those few will miss; those with pasts they'd rather forget and futures that are largely anonymous but for their incumbent state. As the film rolls on, we discover the leader of this group, Jesse (Henriksen), found his partner changing a tire by the side of the road some years back; while Jesse himself, upon being asked how long he's been a part of this sinister tour of the un-dead, replies that he fought for the South(!). Mae, in essence playing a femme fatale without really desiring to do so, has bitten Caleb and thus transformed him; but what is essentially her poor judgement has allowed into their troupe a fellow with a history he doesn't necessarily need to forget and a future which, judging by his desire to get out of the town in the first place, had potential to be full of something a little more than just hanging around. In heading out with Jesse and his sordid crew, the Colton family are sparked into searching for their missing boy, but everyone's departing additionally allows the sordid love story between Mae and Caleb to brood.Mae and Caleb's tryst is the heart of the film, the core of the picture around which varying B-movie elements may revolve the father of Caleb, a determined man played by Tim Thomerson with the right amount of apprehension and urgency, troops around trying to find out what's going on whereas all the hunting and finding of human food from the vampires' point of view is the grizzly stuff we sort of expect to rear up now and again. At a point where Caleb is still too early into his tenure as a vampire, he must 'feed' from Mae momentarily to avoid starvation &#x96; a sequence that carries with it its own sexual overtones as she pulls expressions of ecstasy and he appears to be knelt in front of her whilst eating out of her hand.What is enjoyable is its understated attitude to the villains; creatures who're granted their own patriarchy and set of rules and morals but remain the enemies, despite our eagerness for Caleb's father to do his best in finding his son. Most films of this ilk from around this time took place indoors, such as The Evil Dead, or continuously bumped along with C. Thomas Howell's character in The Hitcher. These films might cover the hapless lead trapped in a scary situation fending off the elements and fighting for his life, but Near Dark spends its time WITH this pack of monsters; their transportation; their lives and the moment's in-between picking off their latest targets. The film is an exciting chase picture; a coming of age piece and one of your more bog standard horror films about a pack of evil, unabashed blood craving monsters picking off victims. The film requires some rewriting in regards to its ending, which is both straight out of 1984's The Terminator and needed to be more ambiguous, but Near Dark is a solid and often smart, if unbalanced, genre film.

While in Vegas he marries hooker and hustler Ginger(Sharon Stone)and receives help from friend and gangster Nicky Santoro(Joe Pesci). But as time goes on Ace,Ginger and Nicky discovers that their successes will lead to violence,death and betrayal and know that no one stay's on top forever.Released in 1995,Casino surprising received a mixed reception among critics and one of the criticisms of Casino is that the film was too similar to Scorsese's earlier Gangster film Goodfellas. But,thanks to showings on Cable TV,Home Video and DVD sales Casino has now been regarded as as a classic and one of Scorsese's best films and it's rightfully deserved. If Goodfellas was about the rise and fall of a New York Gangster then Casino is about the rise and fall of a empire. With Casino,Scorsese gives viewers a big and violent epic gangster film and shows viewers a different side of Las Vegas that most people probably already knew about but not many have seen where the city of LV is being secretly controlled by the Mob and where money and violence rule the glitz and glamor of Las Vegas. Casino is in many ways a tragic film where the characters in the film have success and money but there are many things that happen in the film mess up their own empire and value because when you listen to most of the narration in the film you feel like the characters are looking back at their past with regret and wishing they would have done something different. The rise and fall in this film is almost like a Shakespere play. One of the things that I always loved about Casino is the cinematography because Scorsese and cinematographer Robert Richardson gives the film a beautiful and stylish look where the colors of the suits and production design just come off the screen and hit you in the eye. Scorsese cleverly tricks viewers with the beauty of the film and almost makes viewers forget about the violence and death that is in the air. The photography is one of the things that is different from Goodfellas because where Goodfellas seem more gritty and dirty,Casino is almost like Goodfellas glamorous and flamboyant little brother in comparison. The three main characters Ace,Ginger and Nicky,like in most of Scorsese films aren't always the most likable but have levels of depth and dimension that each characters shows throughout the film when things are happening around them whether it's buy their own doing with Aces' pride and ego,Ginger's troubled past and present,Nicky's violence or by someone else. You don't always like the main characters,but you don't hate them either. Although Casino is nearly three hours long the film moves at a quick pace and there isn't a wasted scene in the film. It's one of fastest near three hours you will ever watch. The violence in the film is bloody and deadly and Scorsese does not compromise or tone it down one bit showing what it's like when you're in the crime world. The violence in the film is so disgusting that you will never want to gamble or go to Las Vegas. Casino did for gambling and going to Las Vegas what Jaws did for swimming in the water. The ending of the film is great because it is a combination of violence,brutality and sadness which pretty much hangs over the course of the film and it is a classic Scorsese ending.The whole cast does great in their roles. Robert De Niro is excellent and at his best as Sam 'Ace' Rothstein,with De Niro bringing depth and intensity to the performance. Sharon Stone earned an Oscar nod for her powerful,sexy and fiery performance as Ginger,a hooker Ace falls for. Stone has great scenes with both De Niro and Pesci. Joe Pesci is brilliant,funny and volatile as Nicky Santoro,with Pesci stealing every scene he's in. James Woods is great in his role as Ginger's pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond. Frank Vincent is wonderful as Frank Marino,Nicky's right hand man. Pasguale Cajano is fantastic as Remi Gaggi,a top Mob boss. Alan King is great and memorable as Andy Stone,a head of the Teamsters. Kevin Pollock is Wonderful and smooth as Phillip Green. Don Rickles(Billy Sherbert),L.Q Jonesz(Pat Webb),John Bloom(Don Ward),Dick Smothers(Senator),Vinny Vella(Artie Piscano)and Phillip Suriano(Dominick Santoro)give good performances as well.The direction by Martin Scorsese is brilliant and masterful,with Scorsese giving a big,epic feel to the film with powerful atmosphere and is always moving the camera and using great angles. Great direction by Scorsese.The film has an amazing soundtrack with songs by The Rolling Stones(Gimmie Shelter,Can you Hear Me Knocking,Heart Of Stone,(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,Sweet Virginia.),Devo(Whip It,(I Can't Get No)Satisfaction(Devo cover),The Moody Blues(Nights In White Satin),The Animals(House Of The Rising Sun),Fleetwood Mac(You Can Go Your Own Way),Rod Stewart(I Ain't Superstitious),B.B King(The Thrill Is Gone),Brenda Lee(I'M Sorry),Little Richard(Slippin' and Slidin'),Cream(Toad,Those Were The Days),Dean Martin(You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You) and more great songs.

The ending of the film is great because it is a combination of violence,brutality and sadness which pretty much hangs over the course of the film and it is a classic Scorsese ending.The whole cast does great in their roles. Robert De Niro is excellent and at his best as Sam 'Ace' Rothstein,with De Niro bringing depth and intensity to the performance. Sharon Stone earned an Oscar nod for her powerful,sexy and fiery performance as Ginger,a hooker Ace falls for. Stone has great scenes with both De Niro and Pesci. Joe Pesci is brilliant,funny and volatile as Nicky Santoro,with Pesci stealing every scene he's in. James Woods is great in his role as Ginger's pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond. Frank Vincent is wonderful as Frank Marino,Nicky's right hand man. Pasguale Cajano is fantastic as Remi Gaggi,a top Mob boss. Alan King is great and memorable as Andy Stone,a head of the Teamsters. Kevin Pollock is Wonderful and smooth as Phillip Green. Don Rickles(Billy Sherbert),L.Q Jonesz(Pat Webb),John Bloom(Don Ward),Dick Smothers(Senator),Vinny Vella(Artie Piscano)and Phillip Suriano(Dominick Santoro)give good performances as well.The direction by Martin Scorsese is brilliant and masterful,with Scorsese giving a big,epic feel to the film with powerful atmosphere and is always moving the camera and using great angles. Great direction by Scorsese.The film has an amazing soundtrack with songs by The Rolling Stones(Gimmie Shelter,Can you Hear Me Knocking,Heart Of Stone,(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,Sweet Virginia.),Devo(Whip It,(I Can't Get No)Satisfaction(Devo cover),The Moody Blues(Nights In White Satin),The Animals(House Of The Rising Sun),Fleetwood Mac(You Can Go Your Own Way),Rod Stewart(I Ain't Superstitious),B.B King(The Thrill Is Gone),Brenda Lee(I'M Sorry),Little Richard(Slippin' and Slidin'),Cream(Toad,Those Were The Days),Dean Martin(You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You) and more great songs. A great soundtrack.In final word,if you love Martin Scorsese,Gangster Films,Crime Dramas,Robert De Niro,Joe Pesci or Sharon Stone,I highly suggest you see Casino an unforgettable and powerful Gangster and film classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10\/10. ","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"9 May 2013","score":"","review":" When this film first started, I honestly had no idea what to expect. Not a clue.

Hammond invites three experts on tour of his amusement park where his two grandchildren also join them. Meanwhile, one of his security experts betrays him by stealing the embryos of all species for which he shuts downs all security including the perimeter fences. As a result, the animals get loose and they soon wreak havoc on the whole island.Review Normally in these articles I analyze films from a critic's point of view penalizing them for any minor flaw as if I myself would have done a better job than that. But considering my very limited knowledge of Hollywood history, I am in no position to critically comment on any offerings from the greatest film-industry in the world. And in the case of a film like Jurassic Park, I can only offer the wide-eyed overwhelm of a blind-admirer who continues to be spellbound by these incredible franchise right from his childhood.When I first landed the VCD 10 years back, I could hardly understand the dialogues spoken in hard American English. There were subtitles; but which kid has the patience to follow them? I didn't and I didn't need to. The visual extravaganza stimulated such amounts of thrill, terror, joy and sorrow; it cast an ineradicable web over my imagination without my understanding a single word! I did memorize some dialogues and developed a general idea of the whole story upon numerous repeat viewings; although some details still eluded me. As a result after many years when I again sat down to revisit it; I was determined to follow the subtitles as my understanding of American English hasn't improved much. After all I am a freelance critic now and can't afford to rate a film without understanding its story. So after I diligently tracked the subtitles (through quite a few pauses and rewinds); imagine my excitement when I ended up watching a film far-removed and improved from the impression of the childhood spectacle which had been preserved in my consciousness till then!Every dialogue seemed to convey a whole lot of information which stands testimony to the fluency and intellectualism of Hollywood film-making. Surprisingly, I found the dialogues filled with humor and irony even in the gravest of situations which is impressive. I understood the details of the dinosaur breeding, the embryo-theft plan, security functioning of the whole park and the characteristics of the various species (especially the striking ones of the velociraptors) which hitherto were unknown to me. But the funniest thing was the catchphrase of Mr. Hammond 'spared no expense'; which I wonder how I had missed before. Overall, the script presented itself to be as one of the most complex I have ever seen and hardly any less impressive than the computer- generated special effects (the discussions were as engrossing as the thrills). And we Indians believe who needs a script when we can have the VFX!But it would be unjustified to say, it was only the plot which bowled me over this time. All the sequences featuring those amazing and terrifying beasts still zapped me just like they did some years ago. The scene where Ellie, Grant and Malcolm see a brachiosaurus for the first time, jumping to bite a branch and then falling with a thud; was and remains my favorite scene from the movie. The other favorites include the scene where Tim sees the ripples on glasses of water indicating the arrival of the T-Rex. When the T-Rex breaks free amidst the lashing rains, it provides one of the greatest moments of cinematic terror. Along with it, the-car-rolling-down-the-tree sequence and the shadow of a raptor behind the dining table are moments which create a deep impression. Also the climax, where the T-Rex demolishes the main building, has a metaphorical significance.I had become an instant fan of Sam Neill after watching him first time and he continues to look equally dashing especially in his hat and goggles. Sam perfectly portrays Allan Grant who becomes the embodiment of protection in evil terrains. As Hammond rightly mentioned, Who better to guide them through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert? How a man who detests kids gradually gets intimately involved with a couple of them is a heartwarming sub-plot. Along with this, he also experiences the joy of verifying his theory that birds are the descendants of dinosaurs and also the realization of the obsolescence of his profession in the current scenario. Plus who can forget Grant's expression on watching the brachiosaurus for the first time!Richard Attenborough, whom Indians know as the maker of 'Gandhi',plays the founder John Hammond. From a boastful personality hiding his inner insecurities to a crumbling old man who sees his dream shattered; Attenborough is able to draw the viewer's sympathy despite his mistakes. Laura Dern portrays a courageous woman while Jeff Goldblum is quite funny with his dialogue delivery. It was really sad to see the valiant Robert, played by Bob Peck, meet his end; but that shows how dangerous these creatures are.Based on the famous Michael Crichton novel of the same name, the film conveys a message against interfering with nature. One must duff his hat to the maestro Steven Spielberg for providing us an experience as to what might happen if dinosaurs and humans, separated by 65 million years of evolution, were to come together. But being an Indian we are habituated to 3-hour entertainers; hence a running-time of 127 minutes is just a little inadequate. For this reason alone I can only give it 9.5\/10. Lastly, the dinosaurs were supposed to die if they weren't artificially provided with Lysine. But as we will know, that won't happen. Why? Maybe The Lost World has the answer. Can't wait to revisit that one now!

I was deep down in Cronenberg horror, but this title's plot and atmosphere (as described by a rather insipid reviewer, I guess) simply eluded my intuition.

There is no noticeable trace of emotion (maybe except anger), pathetism, or nihilist verbosity in the discourse of Tokyo Fist's characters.

It stars Sidney Poitier as John Prentice and Spencer Tracy as Mr. Drayton. I liked this movie, not as much as many of the other films we saw from the New Hollywood era but it was good none the less. The only real complaint that i had about the film was with its production. In terms of how its made, there's nothing that really stands out about it (maybe the scenes when Tracy and Hepburn go for ice cream). When i think of New Hollywood my mind instantly travels to the creative new styles of people like Scorsese, Coppola, and Polanski.

Zhang has created a piece of work that is rich with symbolism. His use of colour and differing camera angles capture the unspoken emotions and atmosphere constantly surrounding the narrative. Raise the Red Lantern reflects on Confucian attitudes and the welfare of women under this regime. Zhang uses cultural tradition to critique the past. While this tradition serves its purpose in the film it must be recognised as a conscious attempt by Zhang to self-orientalise. His use of hyper-real traditions further demonstrates his need to emphasise the exotic and make the film appealing to an international audience. Colour is used throughout the film to create atmosphere, depict emotions and symbolise power. Zhang has a history of using the colour red in his films. In Raise the Red Lantern I believe the colour red is used to symbolise power and also the lack of power. Each evening all the mistresses must line up outside their houses to await the master's choice of who he will spend the night with. The mistress who is chosen is presented with a glowing red lantern at her doorway and the approach to her house is lit by red lanterns. This display of red gives power to one over the many. With the honour associated with being chosen to lie with the master comes power of choice over the other mistresses and servants. The chosen mistress may choose what food is prepared for all, where she will eat it and can demand usually unobtainable services from servants and mistresses alike. In this instance the colour red is a symbol of power for the mistress. In the same instance this colour red can be interpreted as a lack of power for the mistress. The red lantern being presented to the mistress could also represent her powerlessness over choice. She has been chosen by the master to sleep with him; she has no say in this decision and must subject to his will. Yet another reading of this symbol is that of the western notion of a red light representing prostitution. A common symbol of prostitution in the west is having a red light over the doorway and lends to the name red light district. This western understanding of the colour red may have been adopted by Zhang in this film to further its understanding and appeal to western audiences. For when you review the way in which the mistress is chosen, is used as a tool to gratify the man and then left at his discretion, it has many similarities to prostitution. Contrasting the bright colour red is the muted backdrop of subdued hues of Grey. This backdrop creates a sense of melancholy and impending despair. It also highlights the bright red of the lanterns, furthermore emphasising whoever has the lanterns importance and power over the rest. I believe that the lanterns themselves are also very symbolic in the film. The lanterns are the lifeblood of the female characters in the film. When the lanterns are lit the characters have hope and life, when they are out they live in despair. When Songlian is found to have tricked the master about being pregnant her lanterns are not only put out but also covered. This symbolises her hope being quashed, she is from then on ignored by the master, left to live in the muted background and fated to turn mad. Another example of the lantern symbolising hope and life is with Ya'ner . Ya'ner steals lanterns to try and emulate the hope and life that the mistresses enjoy. When Ya'ner is found out she is forced to kneel in the snow while her lanterns are burnt in front of her. This symbolises her hopes, dreams and life being destroyed. She dies after this episode. Raise the Red Lantern is also a critique of the not so distant Confucian society that dominated China for over a thousand years. Zhang focuses his portrayal of Confucian values on the power relationship between genders. Such examples are evident throughout the film. The husband in the film, only ever referred to in the film as the master, is the patriarch and untouchable. The master has four wives\/mistresses and has the power to call on any one of them to fulfil his needs. His mistresses have no choice in when or how they are chosen, they are treated as objects not as people. The fact that he is married to all four women and yet they are never referred to as his wives is an example of their lack of power and status. Zhang uses two characteristics common to Fifth generation film makers in his telling of Raise the Red Lantern. Both self-orientalising and hyper-real situations are evident throughout the film. Zhang purposely over exaggerates many of the cultural practices and the extent of their influence. He does this to draw attention and make the film more exotic and enthralling to an international audience. He focuses on the negative and brutal aspects of Confucian society to perpetuate the western belief that Chinese society is brutal and archaic. In his attempt to make the film more exotic he also creates hyper-real customs that he sells as authentic. Key depictions such as the use of the red lanterns, the use of the voodoo doll by the servant and the 'traditional' foot massage are examples of an imagined culture created for the benefit of the viewer. Raise the Red Lantern is a gripping, emotional and vivid critique of Confucian society. It makes use of extensive symbolism to enhance the narrative and further the viewers understanding of key themes. Zhang has focused on gender power relations, in particular the lack of power women were afforded in Confucian society. He has used traditional as well as hyper-real cultural practices to emphasise and highlight the moral miss-comings of Chinese culture and in effect has reinforced western views of cultural supremacy.

The story spans across four of the most dramatic decades of political, social, and economic reform in Chinese history. Each decade encapsulates a particular event of Chinese socio-political upheaval. The film begins during the Civil war, leading into the midst of the 'Great Leap Forward', followed by the Cultural Revolution. The film follows the lives of Fugui, his wife Jiazhen, and their children Fengxia and Youqing, and depicts the manner in which Chinese families had to cope and adapt to the drastic upheaval in order to avoid being labelled a capitalist or a reactionary and suffer retribution. The family have to constantly change and reaffirm their identities in a desperate attempt to avoid reprisal. Sadly, as the story demonstrates this is something that in such a stirring time simply cannot be avoided.The Director, Yimou Zhang, utilizes fade shots to suggest the passing of time, the contrast between rich and dull backdrops to imply certain moods, the grandiose landscapes to symbolize isolation, and puts great emphasis upon the symbolism of the shadow puppetry scenes which are heightened by fire illuminating the canvas screen from behind.Fugui is a gambling addict in denial. He is confronted by his wife Jiazhen, a strong, devoted, and selfless woman, with the choice of either giving up gambling and joining her in leading a simple life with their daughter Fengxia, who after a childhood illness becomes a partially deaf mute, or to continue his current lifestyle alone. Youqing, the youngest member of the family, is mischievous and likable and while his father is away, develops a very strong attachment to his mother and his sister.Throughout the film the couple are forced to adapt to the rapid social changes around them in order to protect their family. Their agency as human beings is rendered down to the point where their foremost priority is to follow the majority and keep a low profile, while the fear of reprisal and becoming a target of the community leads the two to blame one another or themselves for the ills bestowed upon them by the socio-political situation in which they find themselves living. In one such instance Youqing stands up against three children who are bullying Fengxia and wrestles the main perpetrator to the ground. Later at a communal meal, Youqing pours a large bowl of hot noodles laced with a healthy quantity of chilli sauce over the head of the instigator stinging his eyes. Fugui tries to restore calm to the situation but the other boys' father claims he is a counterrevolutionary. Fearing retribution of his sons' actions, Fugui feels compelled to publicly administer a thorough flogging upon Youqing. Fugui was unaware of the events which led to his son acting in such a way, but it is safe to say that regardless of whether he did or not know he would have had to have done the same. Having seen first-hand the hysteria that had gripped the public and how quickly such a seemingly insignificant accusation could suddenly lead to the masses calling for ones' head (the execution of Long'er), there was little else he could do.The two major personal tragedies the couple suffer are the deaths of their two children. The responsibility & circumstances of both deaths can be attributed to the shortcomings of the misguided political regimes during which they each passed. Firstly, Youqing, who at the age of 6 is sent out to work as requested by the government so the township can meet their steel production quota. The boy, having been overworked, has not slept in 3 days and is allowed to have a nap behind a concrete wall. The wall is struck by the district chief's jeep, which then topples over on top of the boy crushing him to death. In a strange twist of fate the District Chief responsible for the premature death of Youqing is Chunsheng - a friend of Fugui's from the civil war and the days of his shadow puppet troupe. Guilt-stricken, Chunsheng frequently offers the couple money as compensation. Jiazhen, out of principle and anger towards Chunsheng, does not accept the money, whereas Fugui does not accept the money in order to maintain his working class appearance. The fear of being labelled a capitalist certainly plays on his mind which could lead to him being imprisoned or even executed.The second instance is decades later when their only remaining child is giving birth to their grandchild. Because of the 'great leap forward' where educated peoples were persecuted there were no doctors at hand to care for their daughter during childbirth. They raise this issue with her husband, a leader of the Red Guard, so he collects a specialist from the detention centre to overlook proceedings. The specialist is visibly weak from starvation and stuffs himself full of steamed buns which ultimately incapacitate him when he is needed most. Fengxia, shortly after the birth begins to haemorrhage, but because there are no doctors in the hospital, and only students, nobody knows what to do to save her, which results in Fengxia slowly bleeding to death, dying silently in her mother's arms.The film makes one question whether these dramatic social upheavals were ultimately worth the tragedies so many families must have suffered and endured over the course of those four decades. Fugui throughout most of the film appears unassured by the direction China is heading, but supports the majority out of fear and for the safety of himself and his family. Towards the end of the film however, despite the horrendous losses he and his wife have suffered, Fugui appears genuinely convinced that society is moving forward and for the better of the new generations. ","genre":null},{"date":"9 May 2013","score":"","review":" Title Huozhe (To Live)Directed by Yimou ZhangReleased 1994To Live is a powerful drama set in mainland China which highlights many of the ills associated with the various changes in Chinese society during the mid-20th Century. The story spans across four of the most dramatic decades of political, social, and economic reform in Chinese history. Each decade encapsulates a particular event of Chinese socio-political upheaval. The film begins during the Civil war, leading into the midst of the 'Great Leap Forward', followed by the Cultural Revolution. The film follows the lives of Fugui, his wife Jiazhen, and their children Fengxia and Youqing, and depicts the manner in which Chinese families had to cope and adapt to the drastic upheaval in order to avoid being labelled a capitalist or a reactionary and suffer retribution. The family have to constantly change and reaffirm their identities in a desperate attempt to avoid reprisal. Sadly, as the story demonstrates this is something that in such a stirring time simply cannot be avoided.The Director, Yimou Zhang, utilizes fade shots to suggest the passing of time, the contrast between rich and dull backdrops to imply certain moods, the grandiose landscapes to symbolize isolation, and puts great emphasis upon the symbolism of the shadow puppetry scenes which are heightened by fire illuminating the canvas screen from behind.Fugui is a gambling addict in denial. He is confronted by his wife Jiazhen, a strong, devoted, and selfless woman, with the choice of either giving up gambling and joining her in leading a simple life with their daughter Fengxia, who after a childhood illness becomes a partially deaf mute, or to continue his current lifestyle alone. Youqing, the youngest member of the family, is mischievous and likable and while his father is away, develops a very strong attachment to his mother and his sister.Throughout the film the couple are forced to adapt to the rapid social changes around them in order to protect their family. Their agency as human beings is rendered down to the point where their foremost priority is to follow the majority and keep a low profile, while the fear of reprisal and becoming a target of the community leads the two to blame one another or themselves for the ills bestowed upon them by the socio-political situation in which they find themselves living.

I love Arnie's work, and Robin Tunney is an actress I have high regard for (though she's massively underrated).

I thought it was done in poor taste, and there was something seriously wrong with it.I was bored within the first 20 minutes, and following the film became a chore.Arnie's character in this movie isn't very likable, and neither is Tunney's. The two leads that leave you indifferent (slightly irritated even) -- not a good sign. The Devil was not particularly remarkable, either; pretty lame, to be quite frank.There were some seriously cheesy lines, too. Well, Arnie movies tend to have those, and I've never had a problem with that, but this was a bit much for my taste. It wasn't even cheesy; it was ridiculous. The movie is infested with clichés.Basically, if you've seen ANY other Good vs. Evil movie, there's nothing new here. The movie is utterly predictable and a rehash of all the other movies with the same theme.All in all... pretty disappointing. Don't get me wrong, though -- this movie is not SO bad that I'd refer to it as unwatchable, but I wouldn't want to sit through it again, and wouldn't recommend it if someone asked me for a DECENT movie in this sub-genre.
