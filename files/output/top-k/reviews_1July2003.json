Spoilers contained in this review...!This film is a prime example of how important the PLOT is. Argento apparently gets his ideas from writing down his own nightmares, but he could have gone to the trouble of ADAPTING this particular nightmare. To be fair, the ending is tied up as far as the usual baddies identified & killed (& building destroyed for good measure) type of ending, but it was never made apparent exactly WHAT the coven of witches had been doing. The only bad acts committed were the murders of people who knew too much, but it was never explained whether all they knew about was the EXISTENCE of the coven, or WHAT IT WAS THEY WERE ACTUALLY DOING. The only clue we are given is when the paranormal expert professor says that the aim of witches is to accumulate wealth (which not only is news to me, but never figured in the movie). He also said that a coven had a head-witch and was helpless once the leader was killed (this also is news to me). Why is there a need to invent conventions about witches, when there is plenty of perfectly cinematic and plotworthy mythology in existence. There is a suggestion that the hearts were removed from the bodies of two of the murder victims, but, again, this was never made clear or followed up on.There were so many other things wrong that I can hardly be bothered to list them all but... What was done to the blind pianist's guide-dog when it was first approached (never explained)? The murder of the pianist was actually quite well done, but WHY did they murder him? They accused his dog of having bitten the boy (never clear whether this was true) and sacked him, then he muttered about having heard things (WHAT things? WHEN WAS THIS?). Having proved that the coven could kill from afar by hidden means (the pianist), how come the first murder of the runaway girl was so messy and dramatic? Multiple stabbing seemed unnecessary, plus the subsequent dropping of the corpse from a great height with a rope tied around the neck was surely likely to draw the attention of the police. Oh, and her head would have come off if dropped from that height. The third death was a bit odd as well was that barbed wire or razor wire that she fell into? Is just looked like plain wire to me, and she didn't seem to get any extra cuts or scratches from it, and even if she did, can you die from that? Oh, and what was all that with the maggots falling from the ceiling and all the girls then having to sleep together in the main hall? WHAT WAS THE POINT? Just so that the girls could hear the head-witch's wheezy breathing? Or so that the witches could be close to the girls for some reason? Nothing explained, again. Oh, and why did they keep drugging the main girl every night? Why just her? Did they have a special plan for her? If so, WHAT? Oh, and what was that bat in aid of? Was it just a coincidental real bat? Or was it a supernatural bat (sent to do WHAT EXACTLY?).The only definitely supernatural things that happened were 1) The head-witch's longevity (woop-de-doo!). 2) The head-witch's appearance at the window of the first victim (teleportation? broomstick? changed into a bat? leg-up?). 3) The mind-control over the dog (nice surprise, but how was this achieved? Maybe a mysterious shot suggesting the coven in session would have been nice here?

They instead substitute what we as viewers call ensemble acting, which consists of bouncing off of each other like balls. That happens here, but this is Scott's project he adds a dimension to this, the dimension of manipulating the dynamics of the actors. Meta-acting. His character manipulates everyone else; two of them (Fats and Fast, whose very names indicate permutations like poolballs) try to manipulate each other, and the method is manipulating balls. But then of course, the balls are them, their configuration affects the competition between Fast and Fats, and on up the chain determines how well Scott and his character play their games.Scott is an underappreciated actor, actually I mean to say that he is appreciated for his superb ability to do the ordinary rather than his risky attempts to do (as here) the extraordinary. I can this folded acting. Newman knew he was being manipulated as an actor and himself claims to not have learned folded acting until much later in The Verdict.Piper is exploited as an actress just as her character is. She's clueless.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4 Worth watching.

Bond goes on a personal vendetta which involves more spying, more detective work and less gadgets and over the top villanious plans. Licence to Kill isn't everybody's cup of tea, and some think it's a Charles Bronson rip off, but personally I see it as more of an Ian Fleming Bond movie, which is ironic since this is the first movie title not to be taken from a Fleming novel. Q has a nice supporting role rather than the smaller role he usually has.In a way, I always see Licence to Kill to be the end of an era for Bond films. It seemed with Goldeneye's release in 1995, Pierce Brosnan's Bond is not the same Bond as portrayed by his four predecessors. I don't know why, but with Felix Leiter out of action, Bond losing his license, the last appearance of so many members of the Bond crew and cast, it seems like Dalton's final portrayal was the end of one continuity, and Brosnan's is a new, revamped Bond.
