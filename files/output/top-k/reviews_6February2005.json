This time Hart (Timothy Bottoms) is a Minnesotan in the world of Harvard Law. A chance encounter with a young lady Susan (Lindsay Wagner) leads to repeated coitus only for Hart to discover later that his SOB professor (John Houseman) is her father.Much like Love Story's Ray Milland, the only interesting character here is the SOB. Houseman won Best Supporting Actor at the tender age of 72 for putting his money where his mouth was having stopped teaching acting to finally do it. He followed this impressive cinema debut with a string of Smith Barney commercials where he told us, They make money the old fashioned way they EARN it. So awe-inspiring was this work, it lead Orson Welles to hawk Paul Masson wines.Keep your eyes peeled for a nice supporting cast which is far more interesting than the milquetoast leading characters. Edward Herrmann is excellent in the Edward Herrmann role. This debut led to other jobs such as the Edward Herrmann role in The Great Gatsby and the Edward Herrmann role in Franklin and Eleanor. He can be currently seen in the thoroughly enjoyable Gilmore Girls in the Edward Herrmann role.Thanks to Love Story and The Paper Chase, thousands of people went to law schools hoping to nail a hot WASP. The unfortunate consequence of these enrollments is that one can now be sued for just about anything.It is not that this movie is really bad (like Love Story is), it is just more of a TV movie than a movie-movie. It isn't dated, just... eh.
