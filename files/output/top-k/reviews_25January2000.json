If however, it was intended as an honest bio-pic of a national hero, venerated and canonised by the Vatican 500 years after her brutal execution, then I'm afraid I'd rather spend the money on a history book, and settle down with a bottle of wine, whilst my more than adequately vivid imagination works wonders making its own mental images.Sometimes you enter a cinema wanting to know more about the historical subject of the film. And, sometimes, perhaps because of the clever direction or writing of the screenplay, you leave knowing less than before, but only because the film raises important social, historical and ethical issues. When I left the cinema, I wanted to demand that someone, somewhere pay for the celluloid atrocity I had been subjected to.  The entire premise of the film seemed to be based on the irritating ramblings of a girl who was hearing voices. Apparently our disturbed Joan decided that these were messages from God, and being particularly  vulnerable to apparitions, illusions, call then what you will, deemed herself God's messenger to the people of France. The battle between the English and French for control of Orleans is the political back drop for the life of simple Joan, who reveals in all her heavenly innocence, after defeating the English in a battle, that bloodshed is not what she wants (whilst standing amidst the slaughtered remains of hundreds of French soldiers).The diplomatic relations between the English and the French are stretched to breaking point, until the Dauphin of France is crowned King - a victory he attributes to the efforts of Joan. However, since war is expensive her usefulness ceases to be obvious and negotiations between these hostile enemies are resumed. Whilst the French masses die of hunger and poverty, ignorant of the callous neglect with which the monarch carries out his duties, Joan waits for more signs from the only authority she recognises. Our imbalanced heroin is determined to fight the good fight and continue on to Paris. With a reckless neglect of her soldiers not dissimilar to her own King, she is forced to face the horrific reality of the situation - that unlike her, politics has no cause. The French monarchy soon starts to get jittery with this religious loose cannon and, although we all more or less know about Joans' eventual demise, I wont' spoil the ending.The most interesting scenes by far are Joan's conversations with her conscience whilst she is awaiting trial (played comically by Dustin Hoffman) which ultimately lead her to question her motives in fighting for her cause. However, the bigger and far more important questions are related to her own mental health. Events in her child hood had indeed left her scarred and undoubtedly result in her fanatical actions but the full extent of her psychoses are never really looked into, apart from the reckless manner in which she lunges into battle.Don't get me wrong, I regard the visual and auditory imagery of Mr. Besson's films as amongst the most powerful and vivid in the film business, especially considering the sheer volume pumped out of the industry. However, this time I believe the imagery was created at the expense of a well-written screenplay, and would have benefited from a more insightful examination of the fragmented and disturbed personality that was Joan, rather than the superficial look at the religious crusader whom we have heard so little about in depth.Try and get hold of a good book that deals with the subject matter in a more entertaining and informative way.Harshad C.

The only three flaws I have with this movie are one old man in the riot scene is waving his board pointlessly in the air.  By his actions, you can tell he is being instructed by the director to act according to the action of the scene and is confused.

I can't imagine the police know about this and are rushing towards the crime scene without a pursuit ensuing.  They should not have had police sirens here.I loved this film as the mannerisms of each character including minor ones were totally realistic.  Exceptional acting from everyone involved.

I haven't seen all movies so I won't say it is the best.  He gives a great accent all through the film.  He wisely avoids trying a full Spanish accent but delivers a perfect Spanish speaker who has learned English and is in the middle of adopting an American accent.This movie is one of the few that goes completely over the top while maintaining extreme realism.

The only problem is that he hasn't played in any great movie.  In fact, the only two movies I know he played in are Easy rider and Ulee's gold.  Until I saw it, I thought Easy rider was a terrific movie.  However, now that I've seen it, I think the only good movie in which he played is Ulee's gold.  As for Easy rider, it's terrible.  It's very psychedelic and not at all well developed.  I know it was in the sixties and that psychedelic movies were everywhere at that time but believe me, if you want a good psychedelic movie, watch something like Midnight cowboy or at least something good.   Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) are two best friends.  Both of them are motorcyclists and one day, they decide to go on a trip across America.  Along their way, they meet many people and give rides all over the place.  They also start off the movie by buying and then selling some drugs which look like cocaine.  The first ride they give is to a man who is going to join his group and they all live in tents, setting themselves aside from society.  There, Wyatt and Billy are invited to have dinner and when they leave, two of the women in the camp come with them to a river on the other side of the mountain.  After they all swim in the river, Wyatt and Billy take the women back to their camp and they continue their trip.  Now here's the best part of the movie.  On July 4th, they ride into a town where there is a big parade for independence day in the streets.  The two men start to ride with the parade and are eventually arrested.  In the city prison, they meet a man named George Hanson (Jack Nicholson in a terrific performance).  The next morning, the three men are let free and Wyatt and Billy ask George where he is going and decide to take him with them.  But one night, as they are sleeping in the forest, some men from the city sneak up on them and start beating on them with sticks and they kill George.  The next morning, Wyatt and Billy leave realizing there is nothing to do but leave George there and they eventually meet their own destiny.  Dennis Hopper directed this movie which is considered by many to be an American classic.  I still don't understand why since there isn't anything special about this movie except Jack Nicholson's performance.  Other than that, there isn't anything special.  The movie doesn't even really have any specific goal.  I know it's a psychedelic movie but I've seen some much better psychedelic movies which had a goal.

This same scene also demonstrates the pain that parents can inflict on a child. And, as a further reminder, one of the Exodus references is to the general and universal 'and the sins of the father shall be visited even unto the 3rd and 4th generations' while the other Exodus reference reminds us that extremely unexpected, unusual events do sometimes occur. The movie is composed of what are roughly 4 - 6 short stories (depending on how you count), some developed very little, some more.  But the stories have two things in common  Foremost, pain that parents inflict on their children can be indelible.  And also with that pain, the children may (a) continue to inflict that pain on themselves; or (b) love their parents despite the pain and\/or (c) inflict pain on others.  The second thing they have in common is that all of the characters ( we'll finally see) have some kind of thread in common, from acquaintance, shared common history, etc.The movie does a great job of showing the ambivalence that's felt whenever hurt and love are mixed, of portraying how people can be let down in trusting someone vital (like a parent).  But it's almost completely silent & blind to any redemption or any reasons for the love to be there in the first place, except from position (parent, spouse).If we go back to the movie's Exodus 347 (sins of the father) reference; why do these parents treat their kids so bad?  We can see lots of examples of parents mistreating kids -- were they passing something on?  -- why would they do such things? -- did they also endure a similar pain that they were trying to reduce in this way?

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"25 January 2000","score":"","review":"  The acting is uniformly good.  Some scenes are memorably done.  The themes presented are fairly true (although presented one-sided and incompletely).  The movie is worth seeing for what it does give and enduring its length and arty or psychological pretentions.The film starts with a demonstration of an unusual coincidence that results in a person's death.  This same scene also demonstrates the pain that parents can inflict on a child. And, as a further reminder, one of the Exodus references is to the general and universal 'and the sins of the father shall be visited even unto the 3rd and 4th generations' while the other Exodus reference reminds us that extremely unexpected, unusual events do sometimes occur. The movie is composed of what are roughly 4 - 6 short stories (depending on how you count), some developed very little, some more.  But the stories have two things in common  Foremost, pain that parents inflict on their children can be indelible.  And also with that pain, the children may (a) continue to inflict that pain on themselves; or (b) love their parents despite the pain and\/or (c) inflict pain on others.  The second thing they have in common is that all of the characters ( we'll finally see) have some kind of thread in common, from acquaintance, shared common history, etc.The movie does a great job of showing the ambivalence that's felt whenever hurt and love are mixed, of portraying how people can be let down in trusting someone vital (like a parent).  But it's almost completely silent & blind to any redemption or any reasons for the love to be there in the first place, except from position (parent, spouse).If we go back to the movie's Exodus 347 (sins of the father) reference; why do these parents treat their kids so bad?  We can see lots of examples of parents mistreating kids -- were they passing something on?  -- why would they do such things? -- did they also endure a similar pain that they were trying to reduce in this way?  As if by repeating it with their children they could say, Ah, Father (or Mother), I must forgive you for the way you treated me because I, myself, have loved my child and also treated it badly.  Ah, now that might have made a more significant movie (for me). At least it would be more psychologically interesting and complete, and also fit the Exodus reference.

First of all let me that say while the negative points far outweigh the positive, the movie is not entirely without merit.I am a huge fan of the books, and I suppose I am a self-titled expert on everything Tolkien. I admit, I would love to see every single minute detail from the literary work make its way to the big screen. I could argue that the story is so great there is really no need to change very much at all when it comes to plot and characters in a movie adaptation of the books. I would prefer that the film makers make no changes whatsoever to the storyline, and ultimately I would love it if my own personal interpretation of the books came to life as it were, on the movie screen. But I know that's not going to happen. I also know however, that the great weaknesses of this particular version have very little to do with artistic interpretation on the part of the director. Despite what some have said, the film really fails on its own merits (or lack thereof).First of all, it is blatantly obvious to anyone who is familiar with the story that Bakshi almost certainly never even bothered reading the books. How could he possibly then make any kind of adaptation of them, faithful or not? The plot and character changes are made at random and to no apparent end, and have nothing to do with the requirements of the medium of film or directorial interpretation. How else do you explain intermittent use of Aruman for Saruman, Boromir the Viking, the pantless Aragorn or any other of the hundreds of examples I could bring up?But as bad as these mistakes are, the film simply fails to interest the viewer, whether you or familiar with the books or not. The incredibly dense and rich background narrative of the books is glossed over in a couple of minutes at the beginning, apparently using shadow puppets, leaving the uninitiated wondering what is going on and those familiar with the story just shaking their heads. It is not artistic expression. Its a cost-cutting device. The truly bizarre and featureless backgrounds are even worse, almost totally depriving Middle-Earth of its wonderful and extraordinary scenery. The renditions of most of the characters are almost as bad.Despite this, I do think the movie succeeds in at least presenting a great story that deserves to be told, albeit with many narrative problems, the worst of which is an inexplicable cutting of the story off right in the middle. The animation, though strange, is quite captivating in places if you can get past all the glaring mistakes in the plot. Thus I do own a copy of the movie on VHS, which I actually watch now and then, possibly just because I'm such a die-hard Tolkien fan. But the greatest thing about it is that it increases my anticipation for Peter Jackson's upcoming live-action version in that it would be hard for it to be much worse than Bakshi's.Us Tolkien fans are a strange and demanding lot, and it is certain that no film maker, no matter how talented, can ever satisfy us all. But they should at least try to make a good movie. Bakshi apparently did not do this. In fact, I have no idea what he was trying to do. If he was trying to butcher a wonderful story with uninspired plot editing and weird animation effects, then he succeeded. Advice to Jackson? Stay as close to the original story as possible while living by the rules of film. It won't be an easy task, but if successful I'm sure his efforts will be appreciated by all.

And that is a shame since The Next Generation movies up to Insurrection were pretty good.Berman and Pillar have written a movie that has elements of a story that Deep Space Nine incorporated into its arc. A moralistic plot that tries to hammer its point to the people watching the movie forced relocating of people, much like what happened to the American Indians, is horrible. No matter what the circumstance, it should be in our moral philosophy that relocating people without their explicit permission is wrong. A variation of Kantian philosophy the ends don't justify the means.As others have mentioned, the plot is flimsy, and the characters of the Enterprise act like buffoons. The romance between Picard and the Baku woman was lacking complete substance. What woman would want to have a relationship with Picard, who has the personality of a door knob? Well, maybe Tipper Gore.Going back to the moral point of view the other Star Trek movies had some moral lesson to teach, but it was hardly as rampant as it was in Insurrection.

Running Time 180 minutes. Rated R (for scenes of strong disturbing violence, language, and some sexuality)By Blake French\tIt's not everyday that a movie is able to change an audiences opinion on something. The Green Mile is a movie that made me think long and hard about supporting the death penalty. The film, based on a novel by  Stephen King, contains such a variety of emotional events that it repels its audience away from its subject rather than glamorizing it. Only a handful of recent productions have been capable of such power. The Green Mile is truly one of the best films this year and is Oscar Worthy in many categories. It is a unique, three hour experience that must be seen to believe.  The story is more of a personal narrative than an actual plot. The film offers an interesting perspective of the events that take place. It is seen through the eyes of a man who is over one hundred years of age, Paul Edgecomb, who is currently living in an old folks home with his friend, Elaine. During a very emotional day for Paul, he tells Elaine of a historical year in his experiences. She listens closely to his story.He tells of a particular year in the 1930's. The setting is a beautifully crafted prison hall. Paul explains he used to be a kind prison guard on death row in charge of overseeing the executions. In this year, several significant activities occurred in his life he had a terribly painful urinary infection, and met a prisoner named John Coffey. This man has been sentenced to the electric chair for the rape and murder of two innocent little girls. This man isn't like anyone else Paul has seen, however. Aside from being massive in size, he is humble, mild mannered, and caring. After several miraculous events take place that may point to the thought that John Coffey might have magical powers from God, Paul begins to doubt the crimes this so called criminal has been convicted of. \tThroughout the story we witness three executions that in an electric chair. These capital punishment sequences have much power and significance. The electrocutions, one in particular, contain some of the most unsettling, disturbing material in film history. The movie is anti death penalty; we see the sometimes sadistic world from the prisoner guards point of view. It will put you in their shoes--and perhaps, change your opinion on the death penalty. I certainly had to think about my stand on this issue.I did have questions that were not really answered by the filmmakers. I wanted more on John Coffey's magical powers; the miracles aren't investigated enough to suit our pleas. I think the movie could have also stood on a firmer platform of religion. We assume that Coffey's abilities are a gift from God from the character's dialogue, but religion itself is more of a theme in the film than a message or plot point.

Yes, the film is loaded with parallels, symbols, and metaphors, enough for endless discussion. However, much of it is noise, drowning out the message--but maybe that's the point.The following includes detail from the filmThe opening 'coincidence' series and its reappearance later was a completely wasteful and unnecessary ploy; too much of a spelling-out, as it is quite a turn-off to be told what the film may be about before anything meaningful happens.And even the introductory scene that followed, while interesting, could have been scrapped.Story is sacrificied for these tidbits of form.For example Did we need Tommie (old quiz whiz) just for the sake of his parallel, Stanley (new quiz whiz)? Yes, it is the past and the future colliding in the same guise--very clever & we have another (among others) with Jimmy Gator and Earl Partridge--but was Tommie even remotely connected or captivating?

Upon graduating, he moved to New York and began working on commercial, experimental films, and music videos. BEFORE THE RAIN is his first full-length feature, for which he returned to his native country to make. He was able to secure British and French financing with his creative, authoritative and topical screenplay. An inspiring tale about the senselessness of war and the fragility of humans and their loves, the film is, despite some minute flaws, one of the most  passionate and  sublime cinematic statements of the '90s.It has an intriguing, if not wholly original non-linear narrative structure. Through three episodes titled, Words, Faces, and Pictures, respectively, the viewer is introduced to three characters whose lives interconnect from minute to strongly significant ways. Kiril (Gregoire Collin, of OLIVIER, OLIVIER) is a young novice in an Orthodox monastery who cannot help but hide Zamira (Labina Mitevska), a fugitive Albanian girl, from the villagers who want to execute her for murdering a shepherd. He does it out of the goodness of his heart, but perhaps also out of the beginnings of a lustful affection for her. They flee north in an attempt to find Kiril's uncle in Skopje, and meet with dire hardship and tragedy.Meanwhile, in England, Anne (Katrin Kartlidge, most familiar as the lisping goth girl from Mike Leigh's film NAKED), a photo editor is in the midst of a personal crisis. She is becoming more and more disaffected with her husband Nick (Jay Villiers) while experiencing a difficult, confused relationship with her lover, Aleksandar (Rade Serbedzija), an award-winning native Macedonian photographer. Unsure of what to do, she distances herself from both men, but cannot stem the tide of the turbulent events all around her. The story dispenses with her husband in somewhat contrived way, and she ends up trying to find Aleksandar, who has since left for Macedonia.Aleksandar returns to his native village, only to find that the overall climate has radically changed, and the simple life he tries to rediscover has since been made more complex by the feuds with the Albanians. His return is met with mixed reactions from warm welcomes from his close friends, to cold-shouldering by the newly-armed local anti-Albanian faction, to outright hatred from some of the Albanians. When his childhood love from a neighboring village seeks his aid to help protect her daughter, Aleksandar is thrust into the heart of the conflict, and his refusal to takes sides has tragic repercussions. Serbedzija interprets the role with a noble, morally centered sense of confidence. One of former Yugoslavia's most well known and respected actors, Serbedzija found his role to be a way of protesting the conflicts in his region-As an artist, as someone well-known, I had to speak out against nationalism and war. As Aleksandar was presumed to take sides, so was I. It's my story. What ends up happening to Aleksandar, when cousins take arms against cousins, has happened to many in former Yugoslavia and it could happen to me.With its non-linear structure, the time-line of the film is somewhat incoherent, and there are some plot developments in the middle segment, occurring in England, which are a bit too pat. These are balanced by the striking, somewhat exotic visuals and original, exhilarating neo-ethnic music by a group called Anastasia, fine acting (especially by Collin and Serbedzija), and an overall poignant sense of the waste of war, even a war in its beginnings. Manchevski illuminates his use of the film's title - There was this sense of something heavy beginning to happen, something looming in the air. At the same time life was continuing as before. This story doesn't deal with the political aspects of how wars start. It's about human passion and how it can lead one in different, unexpected directions. It's about how a war somewhere in the world might get started and how that can affect your life regardless of where you are. Ultimately, it's about taking sides.

This story doesn't deal with the political aspects of how wars start. It's about human passion and how it can lead one in different, unexpected directions. It's about how a war somewhere in the world might get started and how that can affect your life regardless of where you are. Ultimately, it's about taking sides.

Everyone who's been raving about this movie needs to gain a little perspective.  They seem to be confusing ambition with artistic success, and the film is nothing if not ambitious.  After Boogie Nights, I eagerly awaited PT Anderson's next film, and I can say without a doubt that this was one of the most crushing disappointments in my recent moviegoing memory. It's as if my boyhood crush had exposed some sides of his personality that were shallow, vulgar, and not as alluring as I had previously thought.First of all, let's get one thing out of the way people who dislike this film (and I did like some of it), are not intellectually inferior to those who get it.  This type of condescension, not prayer, is truly the last refuge of a scoundrel.  I (we) understand what he was trying to do, he simply did not succeed.  He is not the first filmmaker to try his hand at magic realism, and he won't be the last (the superior American Beauty even tried this year with the same mixed results). In order for the raining frogs to work, there has to be more logic (even dreams have logic) than just sticking an Exodus 8.2 sign in an extras hand during the game show sequence and hope you are observant enough to pick it out.  Who is this sign holder, and why is he there?  This sort of glib pretension is really unfortunate.Secondly, let's talk about the confrontations between various characters. The worst scene in the otherwise excellent Boogie Nights is the confrontation between Dirk and his mother (ridiculously overplayed by Joanna Gleason in an underwritten part).  Not a moment of it is believable, and Magnolia is full of underwritten scenes like this.  And such shameless overacting!  Tom Cruise deserves to lose the supporting actor nomination he's likely to receive for all that paraplegic emoting at Jason Robard's death bed. And while we're at it, why was Jason Robard's last speech so damn long?  Mr. Anderson needs to learn how to edit his own writing, or find someone to stop him before he writes again.  Julianne Moore, who was so great in Cookie's Fortune, An Ideal Husband, and The End of the Affair is left here to twist in the wind with lots of eye popping theatrics and lines like I sucked other men's c*cks! that even she can't put over. Lots of other good actors are wasted similarly. The Aimee Mann songs that accent the film are among my favorite parts of the movie (indeed, I've loved her music for so long that PT Anderson's affection for her, plus the inclusion of 2 Supertramp songs on the soundtrack, fooled me into thinking he may be my spiritual twin for a while).I suppose it's worth noting that at least the movie is responsible for some spirited debates, but the next time I walk into a Paul Thomas Anderson film, it will be with my guard up and a broken heart.
