The shift has a notorious past, because it took the life of old workers. We also come to know that the deaths have something to do with rats.

I remembered it as being a pretty good sci-fi\/horror flick but I wasn't sure if it'd still hold up. Also, knowing the background of studio interference, I was curious to see what sort of material was left on the cutting room floor.Now, with the benefit of several more years of movie-watching experience, I can see that the movie is highly derivative. But at least Anderson & company chose good films to borrow from. The general concept of a 'haunted house movie in space' echoes Alien but Anderson has said himself that his main influences were Kubrick's The Shining & Wise's The Haunting. Though the film blatantly copies scenes from both of these films and at least a couple of others, this general concept invests the film with some degree of originality.That's not to say that the story completely works, though. Some of the details are intentionally vague, which could equally be the result of sloppy writing. The fact that the third act devolves into a fairly standard action movie climax also undermines the careful building of suspense that provides the bulk of the film's memorable moments.As for the cast, it's not bad but most of the actors are shackled by their clichéd characters. Laurence Fishburne & Sam Neill are solid as always but this isn't exactly the best material they've had to work with. The rest of the cast also perform their functions well, even if their characters don't offer anything we haven't seen countless times before.In terms of production values, Event Horizon holds it's own for the most part. Despite being only the second best Paul Anderson working in Hollywood today, Paul W.S. Anderson's direction isn't bad. There are some nice shots from time to time and he does a good job of establishing (and maintaining) the film's atmosphere. The visual effects are generally pretty good, though I was less than impressed with some of the 'burning man' visuals.Ultimately, Event Horizon has some memorable scares but its shortcomings limit its appeal to a cult following. A director's cut would probably improve matters a little but I highly doubt that the movie would rise anywhere near the level of the films that it imitates.

The film is shot in black and white, is very low budget and reeks of first film production values. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing.Running just over an hour and half, the story concerns two employees of a convenience and video rental store, Randal and Dante, respectively. Taking place over one day, it begins with Randal being coerced into work on his day off. What follows is less of a plot and more a series of vignettes that tell the story that unfolds. Hockey, sex, smoking, drugs, death, the doll drum of life, the predictability and annoyance of work, friendship, love, and lots and lots of cussing make for one funny movie.The humor is really what makes Clerks. work. Smith's writing is on fire, hilarious, realistic and on the nose. Some of the dialogue is destined to, and has become classic. Trying not to give anything away, remember these words (for those who have not seen this movie yet) 37 and Star Wars. The writing and humor, as mentioned is the strongest part of Clerks., so take that away and what are we left with?Super low budget, almost student film like, Clerks. actually at times feels like a student film. The acting is, not bad, but not great. The editing, pretty doldrum. In fact, the editing makes the acting seem stilted to a certain degree. The cast gives it their all, Jeff Anderson, who plays Dante, is laugh out loud funny but like the rest of the leads, he comes off as slightly amateurish. Jason Mewes (Jay) and Kevin Smith (Silent Bob) fare the best, while not Oscar worthy they are the only two that move past the 'film-school' sense of acting and possess a sense of 'skill'.Not that the rest of the acting is horrendous by any means, but what can you expect when a film is made by a few guys straight out of film school. As I said before, the editing is rather ho hum, with glaring inconsistencies, bad jump cuts and very slight issues with pacing. The film could maybe be trimmed by a few minutes, but for the life of me, thinking back on it, I can't think of what. It just seemed a tad sluggish.Another issue is Smith's directing. A word to describe the direction of Clerks. is Static. That's right, static. What do I mean? Well, like the story, where not much is happening, so to is the direction of the film. The camera rarely moves, the people rarely move, and the action rarely moves from one location; everything is still, there is no flow, there is no sense of style, again the word to use is static. It's almost as if Smith just pointed the camera and shot, making the direction seem cold and rigid.Now don't get me wrong, I did like this movie. It was original, and funny. Very funny. I watched this for the first time two days ago (Feb. 12\/2012) and enjoyed it immensely. I thought the writing was superb, and although there is not much of a story, I was compelled to the end, laughing all the way. The writing really does elevate this movie to higher place.The static direction, choppy editing and 'film-school' acting was a mild deterrent, as was the ever so slightly sluggish pace.

First of all, the plot develops at quite a slow pace. The director is not in a hurry, for there are no budget restrictions, apart from the materials.

Russian Bolshevists know that they are nothing more than a face amidst the masses. Their ideal is spending a weekend in their datsja (second house). In this respect the film strongly differs from Die Legende von Paul und Paula, made in East-Germany at about the same time (recommended). In addition Moscow doesn't believe in tears describes daily events in the lives of common people. Nonetheless, the film is certainly not boring. In fact it is amazing (just read on). Let me briefly sketch the story, so that you can judge if it is your thing. In the thirties of the last century three female laborers, Katja, Ljudmilla, and Tonja, work in a production plant. They live together on the campus of the factory. Of course they all want to marry. Tonja quickly finds and is satisfied with a laborer. Katja and especially Ljudmilla aim higher, and pretend to be intellectuals. They organize parties and evenings for real intellectuals. Ljudmilla is successful, whereas Katja is less lucky. She befriends a camera man of the TV station, Rodion, and becomes pregnant. When Rodion discovers that she is actually just a laborer, he immediately leaves her. Then the story jumps another twenty years into the future. Katja has a grownup daughter, and has become the director of her company (not very credible). She is still single (after the war men were scarce). But finally she meets an instrument maker, Gosha. Within one day he proposes, and Katja doesn't seem to be unhappy about it. But then Rodion emerges again. He has been married twice, is still a camera man, and likes to start again with Katja. Obviously she is no longer interested, and refuses him in favor of Gosha. Quiet happiness, and end of story. So what is typical about this film? Evidently it relates to the lives of laborers, and Katja has even been praised as a hero of labor (just a medal, a simple thank you, no money involved). Clearly the script writer has more sympathy for instrument makers than for camera men. He transforms the intellectual of Ljudmilla into a drunkard. Everything is real life (realism), there are no false sentiments. Bolshevism doesn't believe in tears. The plain message is that happiness will come to the patient ones. In a Bolshevistic society chances are abundant and patience is a virtue. However, although the film reflects on the Bolshevistic society and its values, it is certainly not propaganda. It is simply a nice portrayal of people and relations, that tries to satisfy the good-natured observer. Amazing, isn't it?

The sad episode is infamous for the The Dingo took my baby line, the desperate cry of a mother, Lindy Chamberlain who saw the dingo coming off the tent where she put little Azaria a few minutes before, before it would be reduced to an 'opinion' debated by millions of Australians and questioned in trial. The Chamberlains would end up being convicted for the murder of their own baby after no evidence of a piece of clothing took by a dingo could be found.And whether it was the dingo who took little Azaria or Lindy, with the complicity of her husband Michael, who killed her child, matters less in the course of the film than the mechanisms that lead to one conviction to another. And Schepisi handles the case with a relative precision allowing us to understand to which extent, media, public opinion, the carrying of the case by the Law, the limitations of the police investigations, and last but no least, the reactions of the Chamberlain's family influenced perceptions and divided people. Recognized by the American Film Institute as the 9th in the list of the 10 greatest courtroom dramas, A Cry in the Dark provides a powerful social commentary about the fourth power and its undeniable interference with public opinion in the name of emotionalism and sensationalism.If I were bold, I would even make a comparison with the Dreyfus affair in France, although the political implications are totally different. But both cases strongly divided opinions, and the cultural background of the main protagonist played a significant role. Indeed, the Chamberlains are followers of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, technically, we don't learn much about it except in the way it strongly influences their lives and can easily make them look or sound like an obscurantist Church from common people's perspective. Michael is a pastor and constantly refers to Jesus and the end of the world, even when he's stuck by such a tragic event, even when he thanks people from the campground for their help. But it's Lindy who crystallizes the hatred and the suspicion. She looks cold and tough, has no difficulty to evoke the most gruesome details about the investigation, she's in a total contradiction about the way opinion would picture a mother who just lost her baby. At the end, what we have is a sensational case deviated by an excess of emotions and a woman who lacks this very emotion, and when the evidence doesn't speak for her, we feel that the fight is already lost. The power of A Cry in the Dark relies on the director's capacity to handle a very complex case, full of difficult notions, and encapsulate the public opinion through a series of little scenes showing people debating the case, even fighting over it. These little moments punctuating the legal plot line enable us not to understand the trial but why the Chamberlain Family lost it, as soon as the accusation stopped being pointed at the dingo but at them. It's even ironic that the dingo, which was one of the most representative animals of Australia, started to be seen as a sympathetic scapegoat, while Lindy Chamberlain stroke people from the courtroom as an icy and ruthless woman. And on that level, it's impossible to get further in the review without mentioning Meryl Streep. Calling it a virtuoso performance is almost a pleonasm because she carries with her own talent whatever made the film an instant classic. Not to diminish the merits of the director, writers, or even Sam Neil's supporting role as Michael, but the film feels like a minor production, it was even produced by the Golan-Globus pairing, more famous for 80's B- movies. It's like a TV Movie careful to report in a documentary-style the Chamberlain case without falling in a melodramatic trap. And it works for most of the part, because making the Chamberlains sympathetic would have reduced them to simple victims of circumstances while in reality, they contributed to their own misfortune. And Streep is able to metamorphose into a strong and tough women who refuses to play the game, to laugh or to weep just to please the jury, she doesn't use tears to implore people to believe them. They think she killed her baby, well, that's too bad. Meryl Streep, Oscar-nominated for the role of Lindy Chamberlain, redefines again the rule of acting through her extraordinary talent to multiply the accents, to be realer than the real, and to embody in her eyes all the emotion needed to elevate the film. In the course of the trial, while Michael looks absolutely devastated, his faith shattered by an intolerable bad luck streak, Lindy stands still, her eyes full of an expression of anger and dark confidence enough to chill the blood of anyone. First seen as a loving mother, she quickly becomes a suspect, then a witch, and then even the jury avoids seeing her. I wouldn't go as far as saying that the movie must be watched if only for Meryl Streep's performance, but as it doesn't have the stylistic ambitions of Kramer vs. Kramer, if it wasn't for Meryl Streep, the movie would have definitely sunk into oblivion and not become this pop-culture phenomenon forever associated with Australia.The film was released in 1988 after the Chamberlains were finally acquitted when a baby clothing was found in a dingo lair. It's deliberately anticlimactic because the essential lies elsewhere; it's less about the Azaria Chamberlain case than the sad influence emotions can have on people, manipulating their opinion at the expense of truth. For that, A Cry in the Dark is an important film that hasn't lost its relevance.

Recognized by the American Film Institute as the 9th in the list of the 10 greatest courtroom dramas, A Cry in the Dark provides a powerful social commentary about the fourth power and its undeniable interference with public opinion in the name of emotionalism and sensationalism.If I were bold, I would even make a comparison with the Dreyfus affair in France, although the political implications are totally different. But both cases strongly divided opinions, and the cultural background of the main protagonist played a significant role. Indeed, the Chamberlains are followers of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, technically, we don't learn much about it except in the way it strongly influences their lives and can easily make them look or sound like an obscurantist Church from common people's perspective. Michael is a pastor and constantly refers to Jesus and the end of the world, even when he's stuck by such a tragic event, even when he thanks people from the campground for their help. But it's Lindy who crystallizes the hatred and the suspicion. She looks cold and tough, has no difficulty to evoke the most gruesome details about the investigation, she's in a total contradiction about the way opinion would picture a mother who just lost her baby. At the end, what we have is a sensational case deviated by an excess of emotions and a woman who lacks this very emotion, and when the evidence doesn't speak for her, we feel that the fight is already lost. The power of A Cry in the Dark relies on the director's capacity to handle a very complex case, full of difficult notions, and encapsulate the public opinion through a series of little scenes showing people debating the case, even fighting over it. These little moments punctuating the legal plot line enable us not to understand the trial but why the Chamberlain Family lost it, as soon as the accusation stopped being pointed at the dingo but at them. It's even ironic that the dingo, which was one of the most representative animals of Australia, started to be seen as a sympathetic scapegoat, while Lindy Chamberlain stroke people from the courtroom as an icy and ruthless woman. And on that level, it's impossible to get further in the review without mentioning Meryl Streep. Calling it a virtuoso performance is almost a pleonasm because she carries with her own talent whatever made the film an instant classic. Not to diminish the merits of the director, writers, or even Sam Neil's supporting role as Michael, but the film feels like a minor production, it was even produced by the Golan-Globus pairing, more famous for 80's B- movies. It's like a TV Movie careful to report in a documentary-style the Chamberlain case without falling in a melodramatic trap. And it works for most of the part, because making the Chamberlains sympathetic would have reduced them to simple victims of circumstances while in reality, they contributed to their own misfortune. And Streep is able to metamorphose into a strong and tough women who refuses to play the game, to laugh or to weep just to please the jury, she doesn't use tears to implore people to believe them. They think she killed her baby, well, that's too bad. Meryl Streep, Oscar-nominated for the role of Lindy Chamberlain, redefines again the rule of acting through her extraordinary talent to multiply the accents, to be realer than the real, and to embody in her eyes all the emotion needed to elevate the film. In the course of the trial, while Michael looks absolutely devastated, his faith shattered by an intolerable bad luck streak, Lindy stands still, her eyes full of an expression of anger and dark confidence enough to chill the blood of anyone. First seen as a loving mother, she quickly becomes a suspect, then a witch, and then even the jury avoids seeing her. I wouldn't go as far as saying that the movie must be watched if only for Meryl Streep's performance, but as it doesn't have the stylistic ambitions of Kramer vs. Kramer, if it wasn't for Meryl Streep, the movie would have definitely sunk into oblivion and not become this pop-culture phenomenon forever associated with Australia.The film was released in 1988 after the Chamberlains were finally acquitted when a baby clothing was found in a dingo lair. It's deliberately anticlimactic because the essential lies elsewhere; it's less about the Azaria Chamberlain case than the sad influence emotions can have on people, manipulating their opinion at the expense of truth. For that, A Cry in the Dark is an important film that hasn't lost its relevance.

It is very rare to catch Kurt Russell making a bad film and it's no surprise to me that he makes this film just as exciting as the many others that he's done in the past. And it's not just him either; Russell is paired up with several other actors to make this movie good. Executive Decision (1996) is the story of when a small military group and a few civilians take on an impossible looking task when an airplane is hijacked by terrorists.There isn't much to say about Kurt Russell and his character, Dr. David Grant, because it's likable like any other character that he's done before. Because Grant's a civilian in this story, of course he's going to be much more nervous than his military counterparts. Two other civilians that play key roles in this story is engineer Dennis Cahil (Oliver Platt) and flight attendant Jean (Halle Berry). Platt is good making his character sound like he knows what he's talking about, until he's called upon to diffuse a bomb, but hey, I'd be nervous too if I was him. Halle Berry also plays her role quite accurately as a nervous but strong willed flight attendant. If the situation were for real, it would take a lot of guts to put herself in so much danger.John Leguizamo, BD Wong, Joe Morton, Whip Hubley and Steven Seagal play the military squad. All of which I commend for their believable and entertaining performances as troopers under the gun and under a lot of pressure. Even the actors who portrayed the terrorists did a good job at instilling fear in the plot.What specifically makes this film so good though is how continuously stressful the situation is and becomes as the plot runs it course. Plus, there are several times where the possibility of the covert operation being discovered by the terrorists. And if it's not this, it's the fact that there's the possibility of a bomb going off. In many peoples' opinion, the stakes are way too high and there are too many odds against them. And for a while, I was thinking that too!Adding to the suspense is Jerry Goldsmith's score to the film. In some ways it sounds like a premature attempt at the Small Soldiers (1998) theme, but either way it works well. My only complaint with Goldsmith is that he couldn't make one last track for the credits. Why? Which leads me to the problems I had with this film. The ending is good to this movie but the way it transitions in tone from high tension to relaxation is way too abrupt. I won't say much, because I don't want to give it away but how does playing a Frank Sinatra tune at the credits appropriate to the ending? It's like the main characters are just purposefully forgetting all the damage that occurred through the whole movie! Yeah,...everything's all happy-go-lucky.Then there's the whole issue with the innocent bystanders who die in this movie. Yes, this movie is rated R, not everyone lives (but I won't say who)! How did the Thomas brothers (Jim & John) forget to write in a scene where the people who were lost are given a respectful burial? Isn't that kind of important? And finally, if any viewer doesn't like constant whispering, then I would not recommend this film because for the most of the beginning, everyone's whispering. To me, it wasn't a big deal but speaking softly is preferred than whispering. Overall, I was satisfied with the result, I just wish the ending wasn't so oddly weird.The suspense is really high in this film and all the actors play their parts really well.

Kubrick himself said thatYou're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and allegorical meaning of the film- and such speculation is one indication in that it has succeeded in gripping the audience at a deep level- but I don't want to spell out a verbal road map for 2001 that every viewer will feel obliged to pursue or else fear he's missed the point.

I fall into the first camp.I really like the movie's inaccessibility. Obtuse would be another good word to describe this as well. The film gives you no easy explanation of the events going on in it and forces you to make your own conclusions of the film. It provokes ideas and debate which is why this film appeals to me so much. Very few movies force to think for yourself these days. Everything is usually hand wrapped, put in a box, and given to you as a gift with all the answers and the meanings laid out for you. To have a film that doesn't simply prepare everything for you in advance is really refreshing. But, whatever you think of the film's content you have to agree this film looks absolutely stunning. The directorial work on this film in simply gorgeous and yet another example of Kubrick's immense skills in cinematography. The shot in my mind that stick out for me in particular are the opening sweeping shots of all the space-stations accompanied perfectly with The Blue Danube. And by space-stations- I mean models.

Buffalo 66, Gallo's directorial debut isn't, however, a complete 'nothing,' for it definitely has its moments. Some of the stylistic elements are interesting, the strip-club scene in particular is very effective, and there are entertaining and memorable moments throughout. The music too is a particular highlight. But this film oozes 'indie.' In fact it reeks of it. Made with all the skill of a film school drop out, the camera-work is uneven, the story is lopsided, and the entire experience is a mixed bag. If you know anything about Gallo, this entire film is one big narcissistic self-blowjob (the bathroom scene about how 'big' he is? Come on!). But let's just forget about that. The biggest problem is Billy himself. It's hard to like him.

Although the Python's were happy to have released their first feature film they didn't find this to be a very satisfactory movie, and so they decided to come up with something a bit more unique and different.Thus, The Holy Grail was born. The film is essentially another movie full of back-to-back sketches but this time there's an overriding narrative i.e to obtain the holy grail. It's a clever technique which gives the movie a sense of continuity and the feel that this is a story being told rather than just being a random higgledy-piggledy collection of sketches with no connection to them.And it's damn funny in telling that story too. There are so many memorable and hilarious scenes in this film that are coming with such skill and speed that there will be very few moments in which you're sitting there stony-faced waiting for a laugh. Some of my personal favourites are the French people in the castle (which has me smiling thinking about it), The Black Knight scene (who doesn't love that scene?) and their meeting with the Killer Rabbit.The production of this film was not without it's troubles. The two directors of this film (Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones) had vastly different directing styles with Gilliam feeling that Jones would undermine the scenes with conventional camera shots and Jones getting annoyed with how much of a perfectionist Gilliam was. Also by this time Graham Chapman alcoholism was in full swing in which on some occasions Chapman couldn't remember his lines. But these behind the scenes problems manage to show no signs in the film, which is a testament to it's success. The star of the show for me really is Graham Chapman. The rest of the Python's are as good as they always are, but Chapman just nips the post for me. No one does upper-class outrage quite like Chapman did. Leading in the role as King Arthur he performs his classic role as the pompous twit that is repeatedly bamboozled and confused by the insane events surrounding him.The film also look visually stunning. The northern Scottish moors where the movie was filmed are ideal for Arthurian Britain. From the moment King Arthur arrives on screen to the ending with the fantastic looking boat the whole film's setting and direction is superbly done.In short, a very silly film full of lots of silly people doing lots of silly things, a bit like our government.

And while there really is no story here, the jokes and timing are so spot on that this is too fun not to enjoy, thanks to Guest's writing and the ensemble casts' hilarious performances. Whether you are a dog fan our not, this is one dog show you can go nuts about. Very funny!

They are more for documentation, more for knowledge. So it is no wonder this film clocks in at over 3 hours long, because like most holocaust stories, Schindler's List was made to be evidence to those not born in the time of that tragic and horrific event, not for a jaunty, fun watch. Here, Spielberg weaves in the tragedies of the holocaust with an engaging story, balancing both perfectly, delivering enough plot to make you wonder what will happen next, and enough tragedy to make you appreciate what you have now. While there is much that is done to perfection in SL, it is the visuals that are the most memorable. Kaminski's spot on cinematography and the choice to shoot this in black and white brings frame after frame of picture perfect visuals, reminiscent of classics such as Casablanca. In addition to that, the performances are memorable for almost every performer. Neeson has the perfect persona for B&W and delivers a Oscar caliber performance, along with Kingsley and Fiennes. And lastly, and certainly not least, the production value here is amazing. They really brought this time alive with hundreds if not thousands of extras and sets. It is a tragedy that the Holocaust ever happened, but it is a godsend that Spielberg made this film. It is one everyone should see.
