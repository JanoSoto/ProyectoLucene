His home is decked out in the pornography of IKEA catalogues and he is professional.  However he is somehow dissatisfied with his life as it is and drifts from various support groups faking disease just to get love and emotional outlet.  A chance meeting on an airplane with soap salesman Tyler Durden gives him pause and, when his flat is destroyed in an explosion, he turns to Durden for help.  Together they begin to move into a world that isn't commercially based, where pain helps them to feel more alive.  Together they start a small group called Fight Club where men can experience the thrill of a fight without the danger.  However the groups grow rapidly and begin to carry out subversive activities at large.  When confronted by our narrator, Durden disappears our narrator in charge of a semi-cult group that is operating without his knowledge.I didn't get round to seeing this film until it came to TV in the UK recently.  So over several years I had generally been told that it was a `great movie&#153;' &#150; mostly by people who had HEARD it was a great movie rather than those who had seen it.  So I expected greatness and was taken a little aback by the fact that this wasn't a normal Hollywood film but something much more worth while.  The reason I'm surprised that it ranks so highly and did so well is that it requires concentration and thought.  The plot is basically a comedy, making fun of us.  That's how I saw it &#150; that we are like the narrator but we must accept that this is our lives to some extent, to go to the other extreme is just as bad if not worse.  It is a very clever story and it only dipped in quality at one point for me &#150; where the clubs first begin to become something more sinister (more!) and move into terrorism.Part of the reason it was so well watched is the stars but also the very cool direction that made it stand out to the student generation as something deep (even if they didn't get the film).  I think this ironic as they haven't hit the stage of our narrator and can't fully relate.  However the direction is praise worthy and Fincher was the best man for the job.  Full of clever shots and great images the film is a joy to see.  The one flaw I had was the sincerity of the film.  Many love it because it is anti-capitalist in nature, making fun of IKEA-love etc.  The film is preaching to us about this (and the other) extreme &#150; but most people watching and making it will be living that exact life!  However this is minor and it became less as the film went on and mocked both ends of the scale.The stars do well and I wonder if they worried this would be too highbrow and flop?  Norton is simply a great actor when given the material and he delivers here.  Even with the more extreme actions (that aren't real) he carries them off as convincing.  Pitt enjoys himself well in the joint lead although his character is basically one dimensional (for obvious reasons).  That said he is very strong and takes you with him as he gets more extreme.  Carter is a weak link to me and I never really bought her character.  A shame as she is quite central but it doesn't spoil it too much.  Support cast are good, but putting a face like Meat Loaf in a very unusual role just made him stand out and distract from the role.Overall this is an excellent movie.  Even if you don't get it, it is still great fun to watch.  It is a brave story to try in a Hollywood film and it is superbly directed, acted and told.  Some may rave about it too much but it is well worth a look.  If only out of interest rather than to change your life.

And to top it off, the director had to give it a happy ending.  Sure, it is nice to see a child with her father, but realistically, he couldn't have raised her.  I mean, she was 7 and tricking him in to doing the wrong things.  As she got older, he would be putty in her hands. Not to mention, when she got closer to being a teenager, she would want to get more things and would be embarrassed by him.  The movie should have ended with the child having a permanent foster family, and the retarded dad could visit when he liked and could take her out on outings.I think Michelle Pfeiffer did a better acting job than Penn.  Her character was more realistic as a hard working mom, putting work before her own child.  The changes that happened in her life by taking Penn's case were far more compelling and interesting than the retarded dad's story.  Her story should have been the main focus.Things I really didn't like were the blatant commercials of Starbucks and Pizza Hut. I hate it when movies do that. It just lowers my thoughts of a film.  And I didn't like how Penn's retarded friends were basically comic relief. It was like they were used to break the tension and make the audience laugh.FINAL VERDICT  This was nothing but an attempt to make the viewer feel sorry for a retarded man, even though he did things that were inappropriate as a parent and was not the best person to raise a child by himself.

There's a bunch of cool vehicles in this picture and the drivers are a bunch of lovable eccentrics whose adventures we follow throughout the story.The Cannonball Run is an illegal race from Conneticut to California, with a $1 million prize to the winner. The film focuses on this contest and the various competitors in the race. Our main characters are Burt Reynolds as J.J. McClure and Dom DeLuise as his schizophrenic partner Victor. At times Victor dons a mask and becomes Captain Chaos, a would-be superhero and great race driver to boot. J.J., however, gets aggravated whenever Victor becomes 'Him'. These two enter the contest with a ambulance, pretending to be eccentric millionaires who go around helping people. They complete their disguise with a freakish doctor and a patient in the form of airheaded tree-hugger Farrah Fawcett, whom they hoodwink into coming with them. The other racers are a colourful bunch. They include Sammy Davis Jnr. and Dean Martin as a pair of unsavoury characters disguised as priests, a Roger Moore look-alike (played by Roger Moore) who likes to pretend that he IS Roger Moore, a crazy Arab shiek, a pair of jumpsuit-clad ladies who use their 'charms' to get out of trouble with the police (schwing!), a motorcycle tycoon and his overweight assistant, and a pair of Japanese racers in a computerised sports car. All of these guys get up to assorted mischief on the race. Meanwhile, National Safety Council jerk George Furth tries to do everything within his power to stop the race.The performances are reasonably good. But Burt Reynolds is a jerk for most of it (he's always giving Dom a hard time), and Farrah Fawcett is such a space cadet that it's unbelievable. DeLuise is lovable as Victor and his alter-ego Captain Chaos. Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman are both pretty good as the cunning Jill and Marcie, but I personally preferred Susan Anton and Catherine Bach who played these characters in the second movie.

Dick story gets the full Monty for the big screen. The big question here How far is a society prepared to go to ensure public safety? Does any of this sound familiar to you, folks? I'm sitting here watching CNN reporting that the FBI is hunting for 5 suspected terrorists who entered the US illegally as I write this. Pre-crime? Homeland security? Do the math. This movie came out right on time. The subject is definitely in play.The world of 2054 as portrayed here by our pal Steve Speilberg is not at all implausible. The computers, in particular, look like the next big thing. Ever seen anybody playing a theremin? No? Then how about how they turned Andy Serkes into Gollum for Lord Of The Rings... And the product placement and digital advertising in M.R.? Just remember, kids. You heard it here first. I saw the World's Fair in 64-65. I know how this works. The future is NOW. Speilberg's just showing us how we'll be driving our cars and using our P.C.'s before Chevrolet and Apple get their own ads in gear. The scene with Cruise's character in the mall is coming soon, and I don't mean to a theater near you, either. The film is story-driven and the acting is secondary to the special effects, which are spectacular, but Peter Stormare is a hoot is his cameo and Samantha Morton and Cruise do a creditable job considering the parameters. For you cinematography buffs out there, I believe that I counted 659 different shades of the color blue during the course of the movie. See if you can find them all. It's a fun game.Like I said, if you enjoyed Blade Runner or A.I., then this puppy is right in your wheelhouse. Another classic sci-fi flick.

It is obvious that not one person has any acting ability with the exception of Bolo Yeung and our two agents. The terrible mid-80s rock music (ala ROCKY IV and TRANSFORMERS THE MOVIE), adds to the cheese, but who cares? The fighting is as entertaining as the hype itself. If you are too practical, than BLOODSPORT is not for you. But if you love mindless entertainment with a bit of heart, then KUMITE! KUMITE!Frank Dux dodges the government and authorities while bedding reporters and playing video games in his quest to honor his shidoshi and become the champion of the Kumite in Hong Kong.The moments with Dux and his shidoshi were nicely done and touching compared to our hero and Jackson, where at the end of the kumite, some of their touching moments had me concerned. Inspiring in many ways, yet heartfully hokey and sad in others, BLOODSPORT deserves a look in anyone curious about the martial arts genre. It is a good laugh and an entertaining film at that, if you do not take it seriously.
