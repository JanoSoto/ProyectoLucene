This is her best role so far!This movie is about four drug addicts. They all have dreams, but as dependence on drugs is increasing, their dreams are turning into nightmares.The acting is phenomenal. The story and how Aronofsky tells the story is just fantastic! The music is extraordinary. The cinematography is amazing! The directing is great. I also love how Aronofsky expresses his feelings without words and body language but with camera!I've almost seen a thousand of movies and no movie has ever affected me like this one! Even though this movie is amazing, I warn you This movie will haunt you for several days!Mr.Aronofsky has done a great job, if you feel sick,depressed or got the feeling that you're not going to touch drugs, after you've seen this movie!

Basically, in World War II, after leaving the army, Bob Wallace (Crosby) and Phil Davis (Danny Kaye) team up to become successful song and dance stage act, and also manage to get into Broadway as producers. In a night club, Bob is introduced to the Haynes sisters, Betty Haynes (Rosemary Clooney, George's aunt) and Judy (Vera-Ellen) who also sing and dance on stage, who end up following them all the way to a small Vermont lodge. Bob and Phil are really surprised to see their old commanding officer, Major General Thomas F. Waverly (Dean Jagger) as owner of the lodge, but he isn't having much luck with business. They come up with a plan to save his business with a song and dance act they created for Broadway, but brought to the small lodge instead. Obviously things don't go smoothly, there is a rift forming between Bob and Betty, even when they were originally smitten, and happy Phil and Judy try to get them back together. Eventually the whole show is brought together for a big surprise for Waverly as all his soldiers come to the show, and they sing and dance their Christmassy show with the snow falling outside. Also starring Mary Wickes as Emma Allen, John Brascia as John, Anne Whitfield as Susan Waverly and Sig Ruman as Landlord. Some of the dance sequences are fun to watch, and songs like The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing and Geee! I Wish I Was Back in the Army are catchy, and the performances are alright. It wasn't a bad film in any way, I did enjoy myself, and I can see why it would be given four stars, but the best part is indeed Crosby's treasured song, for that I would probably watch it again. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep. It was number 37 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, and it was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments. Very good!
