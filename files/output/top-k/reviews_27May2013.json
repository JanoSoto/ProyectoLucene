I love movies that play with your mind and leave you completely confused until the very end where everything finally makes sense.So I should like 'The Usual Suspects', right? Let's see Confusing plot? Check. Big twist? Check. Point of the whole movie? NONE.This movie attempts to be clever by blatantly treating you, the audience, as an idiot. I pushed through this boring, big mess of a movie expecting a huge final revelation that would put all the puzzles pieces together. In the end, the movie throws all the puzzle pieces into the fire and laughs at you.*****SPOILERS***** (but really, don't bother watching, just read)What makes a good mystery thriller movie? CLUES! You are supposed to leave clues for the audiences to pick up so that when they watch the movie for a second time, they can bang their heads and say Why didn't I notice that the first time? In this movie, there is NO CLUE at all. Keyser Soze could have been ANYONE of the characters. The audience could never really know who is Keyser because the whole time we are forced to watch the movie from Verbal's own flawed and purposely misguided perspective! The 'twist' is one big joke. So Verbal is lying all the time? That's a twist? You dare to call that a twist? How brilliant! I could have never see that coming!! No, really. You could have never see it coming because there is literally NO WAY for you to see it coming; nothing is revealed until the movie almost ended. The only way you could have guessed is because, you know, the weakest, least suspicious man is probably the killer! What a cliché. The ending basically makes the rest of the movie completely pointless, and gives no reason for me to re-watch the movie again, because it would be like listening to a liar tell a story all over again.The plot is another one big problem. The entire first hour of the movie could have been scrapped off and still makes the movie a coherent story. All the useless, boring dialogues, all the random robberies and gun shooting, did absolutely NOTHING to advance the main story or develop any of the character. Nothing relevant actually happens until the part where Kobayashi popped up and revealed the main plot about Keyser Soze and the boat hijacking. So, bad twist ending aside, the plot doesn't do the movie any justice either.The acting? Nothing amazing. What Verbal does in nearly the whole movie is limp and talk, talk, talk while giving a straight and near- emotionless face. Casting any middle-aged balding actor as Verbal would have achieved the same effect. I can't say Spacey is a bad actor because I don't think he is, but his performance as Verbal is certainly not Oscar-worthy. *****END SPOILER*****I understand that movie ratings are subjected to personal tastes and perceptions. I can understand why so many people like movies such as 'The Dark Knight' or 'Reservoir Dogs' even though I find them highly overrated. But I simply cannot accept that a movie like 'The Usual Suspects' is hailed as the greatest twist movie ever even after 20 years, when there are so many better ones like 'The Sixth Sense', 'Memento', 'Fight Club', or the highly underrated 'Identity'.Spend your two hours wisely. On anything. Just not on this movie. ","genre":null},{"date":"27 May 2013","score":"13 out of 18 people found the following review useful","review":" I love movies with big twist ending.

Trouble is, the closest to the Old West I've ever been was a day-trip to the Grand Canyon and while the memory of that trip will last a lifetime, it's not much to base an entire screenplay on. Figuring that a little cinematic research never did anyone a bit of harm (indeed, Quentin Tarantino has made a career of it), I went back to basics with this classic entry into the genre. It may be based on the classic Japanese film Seven Samurai but this has all the western clichés that fans of the genre will appreciate.A Mexican village is at the mercy of local bandito Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his vicious gang, who ride into town and help themselves to the crops the villagers grow for themselves. After deciding that enough is enough, three of them head into America to buy guns in which to defend themselves. Instead, they meet up with Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) who agrees to help them defend the village instead. Realising that his guns alone won't do, he gradually assembles a posse including knife-man Britt (James Coburn), sharp-shooter Vin (Steve McQueen), sharp-suited Lee (Robert Vaughn) and baby-faced hot-head Chico (Horst Buchholz) among others. The seven of them ride back to the village and prepare them all for the inevitable showdown, each with their own reasons for helping them.Anyone expecting the spit-and-polish of today's movies should probably look elsewhere because The Magnificent Seven is chock-full of the sort of over-the-top death staggers involving agonised clutches to the bright red patch on the stomach - you know, the sort of stuff that made westerns old-fashioned in the first place. What it has in reserve is atmosphere and authenticity - the gun battles are remarkably thrilling and exciting as characters dive for whatever cover they can find and stunt-work is impeccable. Performances are also very good - Brynner leads a great cast but weirdly, I never felt that all of the Seven were that well explained. The script doesn't allow the members equal footing and leaves Brynner and McQueen the majority of the lines. But I don't remember any of them having a back story to give themselves depth while Calvera is actually the most understood character on screen, leering and sneering as any baddie in a western should. The other thing a good western needs is a blazing score and Elmer Bernstein's classic theme really is one for the ages, stirring the blood and rousing the spirit in a way that modern films are rarely able to do.This is a film with real energy and a sense of occasion to it, belying its relatively simple story. But with a great cast and direction, it becomes more than a humble western - remember how the Ocean's Eleven remake became more than a simple heist flick when you first saw that unbelievable cast list? This is an adventure, a tale of bad men trying to redeem themselves and who can't fall for a story like that? It may stick rigidly to the genre stereotype but The Magnificent Seven is still a highly enjoyable film although I cannot compare to the original Seven Samurai because I've not seen that. And while westerns remain a niche area of cinema for me, they are inspiring enough to tempt me to have a go at writing one. Just need to remember not to have seven heroes in it...

Thanks to Christopher Reeve and Richard Donner, Superman is a worshipped character from the magic of the first two Superman films which portrayed him as an honest, courageous, courteous, brave and determined fighter whereas Superman III didn't really take the character anywhere and explore his sudden evil side. Whilst potential, terrible overuse of slapstick humor and a horrendous story destroyed the film to a point beyond repair. Thankfully, Superman IV got two things perfectly right about the film and that is the character of Superman and how is loyalty to Metropolis as well as Reeves' portrayal who absolutely nails it once more! It was almost a joy to see everything about Superman recovering since Superman III and this is quite simply, the only good aspect of the filmI've never criticized special effects in films and normally, I don't intend to. When you consider how great the effects in the first three Superman films are and how Superman II had a budget of over 50 million and that the latest instalment, which was produced seven years later, has less than $25 million, it is so definitely clear that this film was not to ever be made considering the box office and critical failure of Superman III. The effects in this film look beyond horrendous, even unwatchable especially sequences involving Superman or Nuclearman flying through space or Metropolis. It looks like a terribly edited version on Photoshop where nothing looks realistic enough to take seriously. Sequences involving flying around in Metropolis, especially a scene that ruins Superman in two ways involving Superman taking Lois for yet another fly around Metropolis is not only hard to take seriously, it completely destroys the magical moment from the first film and makes Superman a rather hard character to understand. I guess it's time to get used to him in Superman Returns but thankfully, this is the only instance where Superman is portrayed as a douche. Having taken her for a tour, he gives her a mind erasing kiss (which still makes no sense) in order for her to forget that he is Superman. Simply, the special effects looked horrendous. Even Monty Python and the Holy Grail, being a 1975 picture, had better effects of God!Whilst Christopher Reeve is outstanding as Superman and Gene Hackman is as usual, good as Lex Luthor, the rest of the cast simply aren't interesting even Marc Maclure as Lois Lane, who simply doesn't show the same enthusiasm and passion as she did in the first two. Clearly a bad sign! The acting comes off rather horrendous especially the voice of Nuclearman done by Hackman, who completely makes it truly ridiculous to take seriously. The new characters in this film aren't interesting. The entire story evolving around the Daily Planet is simply stupid and how the story unfolds there is completely ridiculous and to top it off, more and more annoying and one dimensional Superman characters are introduced. Even Lux Luthor himself is uninteresting throughout the film and Nuclearman is a complete waste of some potential.The story, whilst having potential, simply doesn't turn out to be anything special or even remotely, interesting. Much of the film is simply boring and thankfully, clichéd slapstick is not thrown into the film to make it worse! It definitely has a Superman feel to it and in some ways, had some great sequences such as the scene involving Kal-El's Kryptonian ancestors where they warn him to stay away from human affairs. However, this scene is completely betrayed later in the film and much of the individual scenes taking place in the film are completely unnecessary and are rip offs from the first two films.Overall, in some ways I cannot understand how loathed this film is yet Superman III is allowed a free pass. It just shocks me to see how this film is the most hated of them all but honestly, whilst a terrible film is made to be a great film when watching immediately after Superman III. A lack of stupid slapstick and a computer villain make this a better film than its predecessor but still not a good film by any means.

The entire story evolving around the Daily Planet is simply stupid and how the story unfolds there is completely ridiculous and to top it off, more and more annoying and one dimensional Superman characters are introduced. Even Lux Luthor himself is uninteresting throughout the film and Nuclearman is a complete waste of some potential.The story, whilst having potential, simply doesn't turn out to be anything special or even remotely, interesting. Much of the film is simply boring and thankfully, clichéd slapstick is not thrown into the film to make it worse! It definitely has a Superman feel to it and in some ways, had some great sequences such as the scene involving Kal-El's Kryptonian ancestors where they warn him to stay away from human affairs. However, this scene is completely betrayed later in the film and much of the individual scenes taking place in the film are completely unnecessary and are rip offs from the first two films.Overall, in some ways I cannot understand how loathed this film is yet Superman III is allowed a free pass. It just shocks me to see how this film is the most hated of them all but honestly, whilst a terrible film is made to be a great film when watching immediately after Superman III. A lack of stupid slapstick and a computer villain make this a better film than its predecessor but still not a good film by any means.

There is a certain intensity to his movies that is so hypnotic in that it holds my attention so much that I find myself trying not to blink in order to catch every detail. Within every shot, there is a lot of attention to detail and from the films I have seen from Kubrick, he seems very meticulous about the visual details and he is so clever how he can make little things add to that disturbing intensity. These little things make Kubrick's films feel otherworldly and grandiose, which is definitely a bit of how I would describe some details about 'The Shining.' I knew who Kubrick was, but during the time that I first randomly watched 'The Shining' on television as a teenager, I was completely unaware that he actually directed it. All I knew after having watched it for the first time was that I was mesmerized by it. I had a thing for horror flicks, but this was the first horror film that I truly loved and the more I watched it on AMC, the more I discovered more nuances that made the movie even more disturbing. What made me love this movie was the fact that for the first time ever, I was actually analyzing a horror film.It made an impact on me in that it brought out my worst fears, and that would be the paranoid feeling of isolation. Where most horror today only manages to startle, The Shining manages to actually disturb and that to me feels more effective in making me feel a sense of dread, and how Kubrick executes that is astounding. Whether it be imagery that is just straight up odd, or its cold, lonely atmosphere, all these scenes are capable of evoking some type of reaction from anyone who would watch this film. What really resonated with me were the long drawn out scenes of dialogue between the characters and knowing from listening to their tone, that something did not quite feel right and this is executed so well by Kubrick. The decision to film close-ups of the actors' faces added an even greater emotional effect that adds to the disturbing anxiety permeating the film.I don't know what else to say about The Shining, but after watching A Clockwork Orange and 2001, I have come to respect Stanley Kubrick as a director more than ever. He has a style that feels distinct, but at the same time he is versatile in ways I didn't even know of. I wouldn't be able to name my favorite director, but Kubrick is definitely one of the top contenders for that title. Mr. Kubrick not only a great horror film, but one that is memorable in ways that it manages to leave a disturbing impression on you permanently. I will never forget the first time I watched 'The Shining,' and although it probably might not scare me as much the next time I will put this on, I will always be able to enjoy being disturbed by it.

But after a successful streak, his path to success was distorted to a slow and unremitting descent into hell.Adapted from Charles R. Jackson's novel, Billy Wilder's The Lost Weekend is an intense and insightful journey into the desperateness and loneliness induced by alcoholism, carried by Ray Milland's extraordinary performance as a struggling writer, drowning in alcohol his lost dreams of becoming the next Hemingway during a four day drinking bout, the titular lost weekend.The film won four Oscars, including three for Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Picture, establishing Billy Wilder as one of the most defining directors of his generation while making up for the losses of Double Indemnity the year before. Ray Milland won the Oscar for Best Actor the same year than Joan Crawford for Mildred Pierce, both actors coincidentally won for what would be recognized as their signature's roles. The film is also the first and only Best Picture, along with Marty to be awarded the Cannes Festival's Golden Palm, an international recognition that, if ever needed, proves how there's much more than a cinematic depiction of alcoholism in The Lost Weekend.Till now, when it comes to portray the ravages of any kind of addiction on one soul, the iconic image of a sweaty and unshaved Milland stumbling down Third Avenue, carrying his typewriter to the closest pawnshop, is worth thousand words of psychological study. When Don Birnam is about to trade his working instrument for bottles of whisk, he jeopardizes his reason-to-be for his reason to live, it's his life in microcosm. Alcohol was not just an addiction, but a way to make up for lost ambitions, an artifice to ignite the fire of inspiration, but ending up burning the whole soul.Birnam exposes himself to his brother and girlfriend (Jane Wyman) his duplicity there is Don the writer, driven by dreams of success and Don, the self-loathing alcoholic chained to the conviction that without the right fuel, his soul would never fully express itself. This is the existential dilemma of most artists a paradoxical mixture of egomania and low self-esteem. The more Don tries to write, the needier he is for alcohol, the more he drinks, the more persistent is his mental block. The ring left by the wet glass is the metaphor of this vicious circle, and the shot on Birnam carrying the typewriter marks the triumph of the drunk over the writer.But the film gets further in its introspection on alcoholism. As Birnam explains to the bartender, it's not just about drinking but having the assurance of the object's presence. The most blatant illustration of the enslavement lived by alcoholic relies on the bottle more than alcohol, the bottle as the metonymic embodiment of its enslavement, the bottle as the haunting shadow coming from the roof, in one of the film's most memorable shots. And when Birnam convinces his brother to postpone the weekend's departure, it's less for drinking than for buying two bottles. Ironically, he's never as resourceful and creative as when he tries to hide his desperateness. And the merit of The Lost Weekend is to intelligently concede the short-term positive effects of addiction on a sick mind.When Birnham buys the two bottles, he happily visits his beloved bartender because he got the necessary supply. A few 'rings' after, it's a whole new character, flamboyant, charismatic, who talks about Shakespeare, the Nile and is capable of both poetry and seduction. We have hints of what Birnam is worth as a man, much more as a writer, and we realize the dilemma of addiction capable to drive one's own inspiration and imagination, comforting the illusion that it serves some purpose. Much more for writers who can conjure up their impotence to write stories by making new characters off themselves, trading the exhilaration to create for the joy to be 'created' by an external element.Ray Milland's performance is the soul of the contradictions governing an addicted soul, that can't express without drugs, but neither with it. As the bartender sums up one drink's too many, a hundred's not enough And ultimately, alcohol becomes the center of his universe, when each second of his life is dedicated to a quest for drinks, to drinking and to a painful waiting. The film features many shots on clocks highlight the sensation of a time wasted, explaining the title since this is one lost weekend that he'll never get back, a painful weekend where every remaining bits of dignity will be thrown to the bottomless pit of his dependence, alienating him from society, his brother and almost the love of his life.The film carries many semi-biographical elements, as Jackson himself endured the agony of alcoholism. But, it's Billy Wilder who transcends the story with a film-noir imagery made of unforgettable close-ups tunneling us in Birnam's soul. When he wakes up, it's a close-up on his eyes to show that the first thing he has in mind, is where is the damn bottle? The film-noir with its shadowy atmosphere and introspective take on a man's personality beautifully conveys the existential roots of addiction. The bottle is the tempting femme-fatale attracting the poor soul to its nets, like in Double Indemnity, reconciling its disillusioned victim with his vision of life.Now, is the concluding shot on the bottle hanging from the window on a thin rope a reminder of the past or a Damocles sword pending on Birnam's head like the bottle he hid in the lamp? Or The Lost Weekend worked as both the chronicle of a poisoning dependence, still significant today, and its own cathartic resolution? Maybe it's just as if Jackson and his alter-ego Birnam, the writers, didn't kill the drunks but work with them hand-in-hand, finding between their confidence on their talent, and their low-self esteem, the catalysis of a true artistic talent.

Or The Lost Weekend worked as both the chronicle of a poisoning dependence, still significant today, and its own cathartic resolution? Maybe it's just as if Jackson and his alter-ego Birnam, the writers, didn't kill the drunks but work with them hand-in-hand, finding between their confidence on their talent, and their low-self esteem, the catalysis of a true artistic talent.

What I got was a complete cash grab, an unintelligently written sloppy mess that provides a terrible story, poor characters, no excitement and tension and relies far too heavily on goofiness in order to pass the time and attempt to match the brilliant comedy of the first two.Superman III is based around a genius inventor named Gus who is recruited by his boss in many of his evil schemes including one of destroying Superman using Kryptonite whilst Clark Kent leaves for a high school reunion party where he meets a former friend, Lana Lang with whom he has an affair for.Next to Marlon Brando, Christopher Reeve was always the second best actor of this franchise and once more, delivers a fantastic performance in this film, generally bringing the same wit and charm to his character. Further brilliant acting by Reeve is shown during Superman's time of being evil whilst under the influence of Kryptonite. His performance is so brilliant that it is the only thing that is truly fantastic about this film. The rest is all either mediocre or downright terribleJohn Williams is my favourite composer of all time and Superman is my second favourite movie score of all time and so, his classic Superman theme is such a memorable one that I happen to love so much. The very start of Superman III was completely wrong and I knew I was in for something bad. The way the cheap looking titles crawl in did not resemble the brilliance of the original and the fact that it wasn't the classic theme playing was downright frustrating. However, when you do get to hear the classic theme play early on when Superman is trying to save the man drowning in his car (in the most ridiculous fashion), I was relieved but later disappointed considering most of the film has an uninteresting musical score that certainly doesn't make the Superman films seem that much better.There were definitely some great Superman moments, particularly early on when he is saving the man from drowning and the short scene in the photograph booth. That was somewhat of a classic Superman moment but the best moment of the film is most definitely when Superman bad is defeated and the bombastic theme song starts playing. This is brilliant for many reasons and not just because of the music but because of the character of Superman and his determination and love for his country. However, when the film is viewed as a whole, the few great Superman moments really fade considering the film heavily relies on overly goofy scenes, especially with Richard Prior's GusRichard Prior's performance in this film is most definitely not a great one but more so, an annoying one. His character is particularly uninteresting and Richard Lester and crew thought it would be appropriate to shove as much lame and unoriginal comedy to his character as possible to the point that he could never be taken seriously, even when he is afraid that Superman may be killed due to his inventions. Not only is Prior's performance ineffective but the story given to Gus is completely ridiculous that it betrays the tone of the first two Superman films. The worst thing about the film, believe it or not, is not the overuse of comedy which at times seems like a warm welcome when compared to the overall story told in this 2 hour waste of time. Much of the film deals with Gus going to Vulcan Weather Satellite and altering the weather, then building a computer to help rule everything and even steal cheques for himself. The story told in its entirety is more awful than in separate pieces and whilst the Superman story may seem great early on, by the end of the film it most definitely becomes laughable. The first two Superman films exceeded because they had great characters. Part of the reason of Superman III's failure is with all the new characters and how old characters are replaced with much worse characters. This is definitely true as Lana takes over Lois, who was a lovely woman to be around. Lex Luthor, Superman's nemesis is replaced by a man with absurd plans, Webbster. Superman III is full of clichéd new characters that add nothing good to the story.Whilst Superman The Movie is a classic and Superman II is a great sequel, Superman III is an utter failure in all aspects suffering from poor writing and directing, overuse of recycled jokes, characters that are NOT endearing, a story that is uninteresting. This brings the film down to a joke which is pretty much the tone of the film, throwing aside the cleverness of the first two and making it a complete comedy film instead of a Superman film.

Yes, there are some pieces here and there which could have been cut to provide a more reasonable running time. But you also realize that there was so much more which could have been put into the film. Even with its exorbitant length it can be said the film only begins to scratch the surface of the epic Battle of Gettysburg. The film focuses on a few key events in the sprawling three day battle, most famously and effectively the second day attack on Little Round Top and the final day's climactic Pickett's Charge. Even at four hours-plus there is no room for some critically important elements of the battle. Really each of the battle's three days could have been its own movie which is probably why the film was first conceived as a miniseries. Once the decision was made to make it a theatrical release a delicate balance was necessary. Make it long enough to fit everything in but not so long that nobody will want to sit through it. There may be some minor quibbles with how that balance was ultimately achieved but by and large the story of this great battle is presented about as well as you could have hoped.The film takes a little while setting itself up, providing historical background and letting viewers know the stakes as Union and Confederate troops converged on Gettysburg. Given how long the film would ultimately end up running it probably could have gotten to the start of the actual battle a little quicker. But once the first shots are fired the film has you in its grip and holds you there throughout. The battle's first day, both in history and in this film, is somewhat overshadowed by the more famous events of the following two days. But day one has its own stories to tell and those stories are presented very well here. The key figure of the day is Union Brigadier General John Buford, portrayed wonderfully by Sam Elliott. Buford's troops hold their key position, setting the stage for the incredibly dramatic events to come.The star of day two is Colonel Joshua Chamberlain whose 20th Maine regiment leads the famous Union defense of Little Round Top. The film has taken the time to allow us to get to know Chamberlain. This makes it all the more compelling when he leads his men into battle. Jeff Daniels does a truly amazing job in portraying this heroic man. The repeated Confederate assaults on Little Round Top and the response of Chamberlain and his men combine to provide one of the best battle scenes ever filmed. It is more than just the high point of this film, it is as good as anything you will ever see in any war film.It takes something truly spectacular to follow up Little Round Top. Day three at Gettysburg brought us Pickett's Charge. Perhaps the true drama here comes before the charge begins. Lieutenant General James Longstreet knows the charge cannot succeed, the attack is hopeless. But he has his orders. The anguish on his face as he gives the order to proceed tells it all. He knows he is ordering men to certain death. Tom Berenger captures Longstreet's pain beautifully, the man unable to even verbalize the order to attack. A simple, woeful nod of the head sends men to their doom. The attack may have been folly but the bravery of the men who performed it was amazing and the film's portrayal of their march toward aptly-named Cemetery Ridge does the men justice. Another brilliant battle scene to bring the film to a close.Most war films try to invest you in the personal stories of a few combatants to ensure you feel an emotional tie to them as they face great peril. This film has so much ground to cover there is not much time for that sort of thing. We get to know Chamberlain a bit and there is something made of the prewar friendship between Confederate General Armistead and Union General Hancock. Richard Jordan plays Armistead and gives a wonderful speech reminding you of the human stories behind the slaughter in Gettysburg's fields. But there are few of these personal moments. The scale of the battle, and thus of the film, is just too big. The film by and large has to focus on the fighting itself rather than those doing the fighting. There are a few occasions where the film steps away from the fighting in which the film starts to drag a bit. But no film this long was ever going to be without a few slower moments. The film has more than enough big moments to make up for any lulls. It has wonderful performances as well. Daniels, as Chamberlain, is the standout but the likes of Berenger, Jordan and Elliott all have their moments as does Stephen Lang as Pickett. And of course the most famous figure at Gettysburg was Robert E. Lee and Martin Sheen, seemingly an odd choice for the part, does well in the role. It was a literal cast of thousands and every man played his part. They all combined to bring history alive in an epic film about three of America's most epic days.

But day one has its own stories to tell and those stories are presented very well here. The key figure of the day is Union Brigadier General John Buford, portrayed wonderfully by Sam Elliott. Buford's troops hold their key position, setting the stage for the incredibly dramatic events to come.The star of day two is Colonel Joshua Chamberlain whose 20th Maine regiment leads the famous Union defense of Little Round Top. The film has taken the time to allow us to get to know Chamberlain. This makes it all the more compelling when he leads his men into battle. Jeff Daniels does a truly amazing job in portraying this heroic man. The repeated Confederate assaults on Little Round Top and the response of Chamberlain and his men combine to provide one of the best battle scenes ever filmed. It is more than just the high point of this film, it is as good as anything you will ever see in any war film.It takes something truly spectacular to follow up Little Round Top. Day three at Gettysburg brought us Pickett's Charge. Perhaps the true drama here comes before the charge begins. Lieutenant General James Longstreet knows the charge cannot succeed, the attack is hopeless. But he has his orders. The anguish on his face as he gives the order to proceed tells it all. He knows he is ordering men to certain death. Tom Berenger captures Longstreet's pain beautifully, the man unable to even verbalize the order to attack. A simple, woeful nod of the head sends men to their doom. The attack may have been folly but the bravery of the men who performed it was amazing and the film's portrayal of their march toward aptly-named Cemetery Ridge does the men justice. Another brilliant battle scene to bring the film to a close.Most war films try to invest you in the personal stories of a few combatants to ensure you feel an emotional tie to them as they face great peril. This film has so much ground to cover there is not much time for that sort of thing. We get to know Chamberlain a bit and there is something made of the prewar friendship between Confederate General Armistead and Union General Hancock. Richard Jordan plays Armistead and gives a wonderful speech reminding you of the human stories behind the slaughter in Gettysburg's fields. But there are few of these personal moments. The scale of the battle, and thus of the film, is just too big. The film by and large has to focus on the fighting itself rather than those doing the fighting. There are a few occasions where the film steps away from the fighting in which the film starts to drag a bit. But no film this long was ever going to be without a few slower moments. The film has more than enough big moments to make up for any lulls. It has wonderful performances as well. Daniels, as Chamberlain, is the standout but the likes of Berenger, Jordan and Elliott all have their moments as does Stephen Lang as Pickett. And of course the most famous figure at Gettysburg was Robert E. Lee and Martin Sheen, seemingly an odd choice for the part, does well in the role. It was a literal cast of thousands and every man played his part. They all combined to bring history alive in an epic film about three of America's most epic days.

Five years later, she is betrothed to Prince Humperdinck, but she does not love him. When she is abruptly kidnapped by three bandits who are then pursued by a mysterious masked man, it appears that all is not what it seems ...Some movies just seem to hit all the right notes, and The Princess Bride is one of them. It works both as a pure fairytale of love and adventure, but also as a wryly tongue-in-cheek comedy, and it has just the right balance of action, humour, romance and intrigue to suit everyone; a true family film if ever there was. The best word to describe it is delightful. With its deliberately old-fashioned tone it may not be the most original story, but it's so full of inventive scenes, crazy characters and hilarious lines that it just sweeps you away right from the start and makes you cheer for the heroes. It features a truly wonderful cast, with the then relatively unknown Elwes and Wright both great in the leads, Guest a wonderfully sneaky six-fingered villain and rib-tickling supporting roles from Shawn, Falk, Crystal and Cook. Perhaps best of all though are the unlikely pairing of Patinkin and André as the desperadoes-turned-good-guy-buddies Montoya and Fezzik; Patinkin is simply perfect as the revenge-seeking swordsman and this is pretty much the only movie where you can see the late great André Roussimoff, who stood seven-foot-four, was a legendary wrestler, and who gives an incredibly gentle and charming performance. I love adventure movies; I always have and I always will. Whether it's Robin Hood, Tarzan, Indiana Jones or whoever takes your fancy, cinema was made for thrills and spills, and this is a terrific example of how to do it right. It's packed with great scenes - the as-you-wish opening, Fezzik's rhymes, the dual between Westley and Montoya, the deadly game with the poisoned chalice, the Pit of Despair, Miracle Max, storming the castle (If only we had a wheelbarrow !), Montoya's triumph, many more. It's also one of those movies where all the technical elements are unobtrusively brilliant. This is particularly true of the charming acoustic score by Mark Knopfler (the guitarist\/singer of rock band Dire Straits), but the photography, costumes and sets are all first-rate. Brilliantly written by the near-legendary Hollywood screenwriter William Goldman (Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, All The President's Men), though the movie itself was funded independently and shot in England. All of Rob Reiner's movies are good, but four he made in the mid-to-late eighties - This Is Spinal Tap, Stand By Me, The Princess Bride and Misery - are all just outstanding and outstandingly different, and The Princess Bride is perhaps the best of these. Don't miss it, and if you have young children, make sure they see it too.

How brilliant is Aliens? There just are no word to describe it, a triumph in every possible way. Great acting, from Sigourney certainly but the rest of the cast is also top notch, career making performances from Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen and Jennette Goldstein. What a shame Carrie Hern never made another film (apparently she became a teacher?)as she's the best child actor in history, her performance is just great, especially in the Special Edition where she's given a lot more to do. Great action sequences, we actually all cheered at the Get away from her you BITCH! scene and I would have loved to have seen it in the cinema where apparently audiences did the same en masse. Fantastic writing and characterisation, not just in the action scenes and dialogues but in terms of the motivation and actions, there isn't a single character who does anything where you think 'Oh come on!', everybody acts totally logically. The clever thing about Paul Reiser's character is you expect him to be evil but for a long time he's not. Fantastic music too, really adds to it in terms of excitement and mood.So what does the studio do? Give the sequel to David Fincher who could not have done more to ruin the series if he had been TRYING to! But my boy Joss rescues it in Resurrection (hence the title) and you note that in the last scene Newt asks Ripley can she dream and Ripley replies 'We both can' so I figure Alien 3 and 4 are just their dreams whilst in hypersleep on the way home.

How brilliant is Aliens? There just are no word to describe it, a triumph in every possible way. Great acting, from Sigourney certainly but the rest of the cast is also top notch, career making performances from Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen and Jennette Goldstein. What a shame Carrie Hern never made another film (apparently she became a teacher?)as she's the best child actor in history, her performance is just great, especially in the Special Edition where she's given a lot more to do. Great action sequences, we actually all cheered at the Get away from her you BITCH! scene and I would have loved to have seen it in the cinema where apparently audiences did the same en masse. Fantastic writing and characterisation, not just in the action scenes and dialogues but in terms of the motivation and actions, there isn't a single character who does anything where you think 'Oh come on!', everybody acts totally logically.
