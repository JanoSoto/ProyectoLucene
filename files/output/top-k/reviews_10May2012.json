On the latter, they use so many things to make it unrealistic that it doesn't even make sense to watch it. But realism works as a counterpart, and it was a film by Martin Scorsese. Who could go wrong with that?I turned it on, watched it, and enjoyed it. It worked as a gangster movie, but anything outside of that? I had some mixed feelings...The acting was brilliant. Everything did such an amazing job, I was surprised at how good it was. Especially how I've heard some scenes were acted how by REAL gangsters. And some scenes weren't told to the background actors, so their reactions were real and surprised.. The screenplay was really well-done. The jokes weren't supposed to be laugh- out-loud funny, but the actors played their parts and perfected them. Their sarcastic behavior made it THIS much more enjoyable and I had a grin upon my face the entire time.. The thing that made this the best was how the whole film reflected of the entire life of a gangster, and how things go in between. Instead of believing I was just watching a movie, I believed I was watching the unfolding of a gangster's life. We have the start, the life of them, the ups and downs, and how everything just goes downhill. We go on an array of emotions and much more. Classic..

Other movies have hit me in some emotional way, but Fight Club did it in a secretive way. A way that I don't know what exactly hit me, but I know something hit me.. So instead of blabbering on about how much it 'hit' me, how about getting into actual stuff?The acting was surprising from both leads. Brad Pitt surprises me left & right, but this was the first time where I saw Edward Norton, and thought wow, he CAN act! And he rightfully can. The plot, at first glance, may seem like your typical boxing movie that adds in one new thing and stamps itself the best movie ever. Well that's not the case. In the first ten minutes, I thought I was watching an entire different movie. Edward Norton narrates every little thing he does, sees, or thinks. It was a really strange set-up, but the strangeness was intriguing.. Then there's the people who bash this film because they find out the twist, finding it silly. I'm sure none of these people ever heard of multiple personality disorder? I thought it was a surprising twist. And for a film like this? A fantastic twist...But plot, characters, acting, directing, sound design, cinematography, and screenplay do even qualify to compete with this film's brilliance. Strangely enough, you don't even know what was so brilliant about it. You just know that something was there that made you go wow and think and think. That's film-making.. But the whole atmosphere of the movie, the whole directorial style Fincher creates, is mystifying. He has created this genre that I can't even get a grasp on. And it contains philosophical elements as well, which further enhance the underlying brilliance of it all... And Fight Club also works as a comedy. A dark, dark comedy. Some parts are so devilish evil that you can't help but smile. Need more? Fight Club works as a counterpart. Let me rephrase. It works as a study. It works as a masterpiece. Everything and anything the movie contains was surely not what you'd expect. Fight Club. You hear those words and think another attempt at creating yet another boxing movie. No depth, no substance. But when you see it, you'll understand. You'll understand a lot more of everything...Fight Club is much more an audience film than it is a critic's film. Critics rate the film itself, not even attempting to appreciate it's social commentary or it's brilliant message to the world. But I did. You will too. Fight Club competes with cinematic classics. It works as everything it's not. It's a favorite of mine. A brilliant, clever film. A film that will engage you with it's warm embrace. To have you reconciling every bit and piece. So what are you doing reading this review on the internet? Get off your lazy ass, and get out there. Do something with your life.

The plot, at first glance, may seem like your typical boxing movie that adds in one new thing and stamps itself the best movie ever. Well that's not the case. In the first ten minutes, I thought I was watching an entire different movie. Edward Norton narrates every little thing he does, sees, or thinks. It was a really strange set-up, but the strangeness was intriguing.. Then there's the people who bash this film because they find out the twist, finding it silly. I'm sure none of these people ever heard of multiple personality disorder? I thought it was a surprising twist. And for a film like this? A fantastic twist...But plot, characters, acting, directing, sound design, cinematography, and screenplay do even qualify to compete with this film's brilliance. Strangely enough, you don't even know what was so brilliant about it. You just know that something was there that made you go wow and think and think. That's film-making.. But the whole atmosphere of the movie, the whole directorial style Fincher creates, is mystifying. He has created this genre that I can't even get a grasp on. And it contains philosophical elements as well, which further enhance the underlying brilliance of it all... And Fight Club also works as a comedy. A dark, dark comedy. Some parts are so devilish evil that you can't help but smile. Need more? Fight Club works as a counterpart. Let me rephrase. It works as a study. It works as a masterpiece. Everything and anything the movie contains was surely not what you'd expect. Fight Club. You hear those words and think another attempt at creating yet another boxing movie. No depth, no substance. But when you see it, you'll understand. You'll understand a lot more of everything...Fight Club is much more an audience film than it is a critic's film. Critics rate the film itself, not even attempting to appreciate it's social commentary or it's brilliant message to the world. But I did. You will too. Fight Club competes with cinematic classics. It works as everything it's not. It's a favorite of mine. A brilliant, clever film. A film that will engage you with it's warm embrace. To have you reconciling every bit and piece. So what are you doing reading this review on the internet? Get off your lazy ass, and get out there. Do something with your life. While your sitting here doing nothing but reading this film, people are appreciating this film, while you are just reading the synopsis, trying to understand something you can't.

Watch how Bogarde sits absolutely, perfectly still on the chair in the attic, except for this subtly, yet unmistakably, he is working his jaw muscles, and they pulse with waves of seething anger, and you can read how unhappy he is, having to behave so subserviently to his new snob of a master. This is a magnificent bit of film-making.This movie, along with Victim, demonstrates what an extraordinary actor Dirk Bogarde was. Bogarde seems to have more control over every muscle in his body than any actor you will ever see. Not a finger twitches, not an eyebrow rises, not a single superfluous body part moves, that is not under the absolute control of Dirk Bogarde. In fact, every actor in this film is under the masterful control of the director. The camera-work too is mesmerizing, panning left and right here, and zooming in or out there. And look for the clever use of distorted mirrors and shadows (a naked Dirk Bogarde, for example) to indicate the action. This is real art, my friends.The plot is a strange one, though on paper it seems straight forward enough. Bogarde, as the newly hired servant, slowly but surely, through extreme manipulation, takes over the home of his new master. But this does not begin to describe how bizarre and extreme Bogarde's plots are. I don't think we ever really understand exactly what Bogarde's goal is here. He lets his girlfriend, Vera, seduce and carry on an affair with Tony, but why? Tony, enamored with Vera, loses his own fiancé, and slowly gives up on life, ultimately changing from an idealistic and active member of the nobility to a complete drunken wreck. Bogarde befriends him, rising above the servant-master relationship, but it is such a weird co-dependent relationship &#x96; an extended sequence shows them trying to hit each other with a ball, and arguing about the score. We never really figure out what is going on in Bogarde's mind. The servant is indeed an enigma of a character.Sarah Miles, by the way, is achingly gorgeous and sexy as Bogarde's girlfriend. Nothing dirty happens directly on screen, yet some of the sex scenes are so cleverly suggestive that they will leave you panting. Look out particularly for the scene later in the movie where Fox takes Miles on an over-sized lounge chair &#x96;but we only see her legs and the back of the chair.The Servant is a truly bizarre and astonishing film, with tremendous acting and amazing directing.

Although Melville's work predates the nouvelle vague movement by a few years, this stunning film clearly paves the way for the movement with its innovative editing, fast pace, use of non-professional actors, location shooting and unconventional story structure.The energy these techniques inject is a far cry from the stilted, stage-bound dramas such as Christian-Jaque's Nana that were being produced in France at the same time.The character of Bob is well-drawn and his gambling addiction is by turns tragic and farcical (he even has a slot machine in his wardrobe).The momentum builds throughout but, like Hamlet, there is deceptively little action. The audience is left in suspense as they are taken through the planning phase of the audacious heist and then witness it unravel before it even begins.The 16 year old non-professional Isabelle Corey does an excellent job in a brave role. Her mixture of naivety and street-awareness comes across well, so the decision to use an amateur is well-justified.The noir lighting techniques and cinematography are still fresh in this film and the outdoor settings are what lend it the new vitality. This also reinforces the notion that this film is taking place in a real underworld, that you could go out tonight and walk around the very same streets in Montmartre and Pigalle as these gangsters inhabit.Of course, it is Bob's gambling addiction that also, expectedly, leads to his downfall as his one winning streak ultimately proves to be his unluckiest of all. Of course, that is contrived but it works well and, again, helps to build the suspense of the film.The ending is both fulfilling and subversive. Again, there is a hint of realism as the audience knows that, in real life, gangsters would be unlikely to succeed in such a scheme and that so many criminals are foiled from the outset. The ending is rapid and encapsulates the energy and freshness of the film as a whole. Bob is left standing, the old man who can no longer keep up with the energy of the new world and burnt out by his gambling.Melville proves himself to be a true auteur here and sets a pattern for Godard, Truffaut and co to follow. In that sense, this is a revolutionary and highly-satisfying film.

Mariah Carey tried it, Britney tried it, Cristina tried it, and Madonna tried it... repeatedly.And thus brings us to this review. Cool As Ice was an acting vehicle for soon-to-be one hit wonder Vanilla Ice. For a year back in the early nineties, the world was his oyster. He had an inescapable chart-topping single and sold over ten million records. All in all, not bad for a guy that nobody will admit to liking nowadays. This movie was the apex of the zeitgeist surrounding him and pretty much encapsulates everything that people loved, and HATED, about Vanilla Ice.First of all, this movie is funnier than most comedies. It's hard to decide what I found funnier; the bad acting, the surreal montages, the silly dialogue, Naomi Campbell singing. Take your pick.Vanilla Ice plays Johnny Van Owen, not that it matters since he's playing himself. His performance is the stuff of legend. Every line of his is so poorly delivered, yet paradoxically given so much conviction that he's a fountain of memeworthy dialogue Drop that zero and git with the hero, I got to go schilng a schlong, lookie, lookie, lookie, I got Kat's black bookie. and his inadvertent catchphrase, Yup yup. I crack up just thinking about them.As if this wasn't enough, the film treats him as though he is this deep, misunderstood individual. We are treated to filler scenes of him riding his motorcycle through the desert and staring off pensively into the distance with added emphasis given to his loud leather jacket with random phrases like sex me up, and down by law, scribbled on it. Other pointless scenes are devoted to suburbanites gawking at him and spontaneously breaking into dance on people's lawns.The movie soon decides it needs something for him to actually do, so it gives him a cold, snooty, love interest, who he meets by running over her horse. She is understandably angry but all our reckless doofus can say is she likes me. As for the actress, she does an OK job, but her characterization is rather disturbing. Her preppy boyfriend manhandles her frequently, and Vanilla, the man she's meant to be with, runs her over, steals from her, and breaks into her house while she's asleep. Apparently, stalking and physical abuse are a turn-on for this girl.The other players in this celluloid tragedy range from bad to laughably bad. Michael Gross looks and sounds bored to death, the brother and the boyfriend's line deliveries are wooden. The extras must've been on loan from the set of Troll 2. Special mention goes to the mobsters (yes, Vanilla Ice fights mobsters in this movie) who make the Home Alone burglars look scary. Never have I laughed so hard at a kidnapping. Then there's the hilariously awful bar band that manages to make Vanilla Ice sound good. And finally we have the bizarre old couple with the even MORE bizarre house. They were so entertaining and morbidly fascinating that I honestly think they deserved a movie of their own.Fortunately you don't have to focus too much on the acting as the film is filled with numerous montages that are either hilarious, surreal, or both. In addition to Ice's introspection scenes, we have the Winslows' introduction scene which is played at chipmunk speed and might as well have been set to Yakety Sax. Then there's the scene where Ice and Kathy exchange a line of dialogue and then start hopping around an unfinished house only to exchange more empty banter before more jumping and lather, rinse, repeat.The plot treads no new ground here good girl falls for bad boy. However, it is the inclusion of mobsters that is truly inspired. And it's all because the father is an idiot. Despite being in hiding for 20 years, he appears on TV allowing the mobsters to find him. Then the mobsters attempt to abduct Kathy by trailing her three feet away in their car with the headlights on. The father assumes that Ice is in cahoots with the mobsters based on an earlier bar fight that he didn't even witness. Kathy instantly believes him and dumps Ice in the next scene. Later the annoying brother is kidnapped and the parents assume Ice is involved. Finally Ice saves the day by using his superhearing to determine that the boy is at the same construction site where he had his falling-in-love montage. You can't make this stuff up.There is one silver lining to this movie though in that it actually helped one person's career instead of destroying it. The cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, would go on to work with Steven Spielberg . He deserves it because even though many of the shots are silly, they do look great.I just wonder if Spielberg ever teases him about it.

She is understandably angry but all our reckless doofus can say is she likes me. As for the actress, she does an OK job, but her characterization is rather disturbing. Her preppy boyfriend manhandles her frequently, and Vanilla, the man she's meant to be with, runs her over, steals from her, and breaks into her house while she's asleep. Apparently, stalking and physical abuse are a turn-on for this girl.The other players in this celluloid tragedy range from bad to laughably bad. Michael Gross looks and sounds bored to death, the brother and the boyfriend's line deliveries are wooden. The extras must've been on loan from the set of Troll 2. Special mention goes to the mobsters (yes, Vanilla Ice fights mobsters in this movie) who make the Home Alone burglars look scary. Never have I laughed so hard at a kidnapping. Then there's the hilariously awful bar band that manages to make Vanilla Ice sound good. And finally we have the bizarre old couple with the even MORE bizarre house. They were so entertaining and morbidly fascinating that I honestly think they deserved a movie of their own.Fortunately you don't have to focus too much on the acting as the film is filled with numerous montages that are either hilarious, surreal, or both. In addition to Ice's introspection scenes, we have the Winslows' introduction scene which is played at chipmunk speed and might as well have been set to Yakety Sax. Then there's the scene where Ice and Kathy exchange a line of dialogue and then start hopping around an unfinished house only to exchange more empty banter before more jumping and lather, rinse, repeat.The plot treads no new ground here good girl falls for bad boy. However, it is the inclusion of mobsters that is truly inspired. And it's all because the father is an idiot. Despite being in hiding for 20 years, he appears on TV allowing the mobsters to find him. Then the mobsters attempt to abduct Kathy by trailing her three feet away in their car with the headlights on. The father assumes that Ice is in cahoots with the mobsters based on an earlier bar fight that he didn't even witness. Kathy instantly believes him and dumps Ice in the next scene. Later the annoying brother is kidnapped and the parents assume Ice is involved. Finally Ice saves the day by using his superhearing to determine that the boy is at the same construction site where he had his falling-in-love montage. You can't make this stuff up.There is one silver lining to this movie though in that it actually helped one person's career instead of destroying it.

Mariah Carey tried it, Britney tried it, Cristina tried it, and Madonna tried it... repeatedly.And thus brings us to this review. Cool As Ice was an acting vehicle for soon-to-be one hit wonder Vanilla Ice. For a year back in the early nineties, the world was his oyster. He had an inescapable chart-topping single and sold over ten million records. All in all, not bad for a guy that nobody will admit to liking nowadays. This movie was the apex of the zeitgeist surrounding him and pretty much encapsulates everything that people loved, and HATED, about Vanilla Ice.First of all, this movie is funnier than most comedies. It's hard to decide what I found funnier; the bad acting, the surreal montages, the silly dialogue, Naomi Campbell singing. Take your pick.Vanilla Ice plays Johnny Van Owen, not that it matters since he's playing himself. His performance is the stuff of legend. Every line of his is so poorly delivered, yet paradoxically given so much conviction that he's a fountain of memeworthy dialogue Drop that zero and git with the hero, I got to go schilng a schlong, lookie, lookie, lookie, I got Kat's black bookie. and his inadvertent catchphrase, Yup yup. I crack up just thinking about them.As if this wasn't enough, the film treats him as though he is this deep, misunderstood individual. We are treated to filler scenes of him riding his motorcycle through the desert and staring off pensively into the distance with added emphasis given to his loud leather jacket with random phrases like sex me up, and down by law, scribbled on it.

Dassin's most famous film is an exquisite piece of film noir that has stood the test of time and remains a unique piece of cinema due to its clever plotting, unconventional narrative structure and intricate set pieces.Most famous of these set pieces is, of course, the heist scene. The near-silence of this scene builds the tension and reinforces the realism, as is the fact that large parts of it are played out in near-real time.The use of lighting and shadow throughout the film is a text book example of conventional noir technique, perfected by this time after its development in both France and the United States from the 1930s onwards.The characters are well-drawn and come across as extremely intelligent, through their use of the fire extinguisher to muzzle the alarm and the umbrella to capture the falling debris. The writer and director ably show, not tell, just how clever and indeed skillful they are, albeit at such an immoral trade.The play within the play (the musical act at the nightclub) foreshadows the real clash to come in the second half of the film. The stylization of noir is parodied in this play with dark lighting being taken to its extreme conclusion shadow puppetry.The second half is, however, a little problematic as the tension doesn't quite match that of the heist scene resulting in it feeling mildly anti-climactic.However, the use of the child as the moral centre in an otherwise amoral world is effective. He is symbol of innocence that even the gangsters and their cohorts recognise (by feeling the abductors have overstepped one of the few boundaries in this violent, ruthless world).The child also provides some wonderfully ironic scenes, especially in his role-playing of the violent cowboy game with the mock gun and the pathos injected by the scenes of the otherwise ridiculous bouncing clown.The irony of the mix-up at the end comes across well and the final montage of Tony's ride home with the child conveys his confusion as he comes close to losing consciousness.On all levels then, this film transcends the typical noir gangster story, simply due to the mastery of film-making technique on display. The use of sound and silence, real-time filming and montage sequence, farce and brutality. The characters are ruthless killers but they are intelligent and their are limits to their misconduct. This film's reputation as the greatest of French gangster pieces is thoroughly deserved.

An excellent screenplay, excellent actors and excellent cinematography makes this one of the best films ever produced and its not hard to see why. The film stars Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone aka The Godfather, Al Pacino as The Godfather's son Michael, James Caan as Sonny who is The Godfather's eldest son and heir apparent, John Cazale as Fredo, the innocent son of Vito Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie the daughter and last but not least Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen as the adviser to the Don. The rest of the supporting cast is outstanding as well.The screenplay is faithful to the storyline of the book, which excludes some chapters from the novel, however this doesn't diminish the movie in anyway. It is a story, ultimately a tragic one, about the powerful Corleone Family and the internal strife, struggle, loyalty and love mixed in with a need for power ultimately makes victims of all members of the family. I am sure all who have seen the movie know the plot well, and for those who haven't seen the movie, I wont spoil any of it, since it is a movie you cant refuse to see. The ultimate lesson of the movie in my opinion is Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely.The characters in the movie are supposedly based on real life Mafioso's such as real Gambino crime boss Sam Boom Boom Giancana is the inspiration for Vito Corleone and Johnny Fontaine is based on Frank Sinatra as it will be easy to see when the viewer watches the movie.This is a true classic in every sense of the word and I can't recommend it highly enough for those who enjoy classic movies and movies that last throughout time. This is only the opening chapter however and there are two more movies (Godfather II and III) in this incredible saga that are just as brilliant as this one and I highly recommend that they be viewed as well to see the ultimate tragedy of the Corleone Family.

It's famous doggerel - Even a man who is pure in heart, etc, has sort of passed into our culture, and it sustains its aura of tragedy right to the end, proving immensely superior to its recent ham-fisted remake.The film, of course, concerns Lawrence Talbot's (Lon Chaney Jr) return to his ancient family home of Llanwelly, Wales, which looks a lot like Transylvania here. After many years in America. Larry has reconciled with his father Sir John (an excellent Claude Raines), and is to run the Talbot Estate. It isn't long before he has spied (literally through the use of a telescope) the lovely Gwen (Evelyn Ankers), daughter of a local antique shop owner. And of course, there is the sinister party of Gypsies that lurk in the woods.It isn't long before Larry meets Bela (unsuprisingly Bela Lugosi!) who sees the sign of the Pentagram on a soon to be victim when he reads her fortune. Poor Bela, you see, is a werewolf, and he's about to pass on the curse...What still grabs you about the film is Chaney's tortured performance as Larry. Poor Lon was just as tortured in real life as his character, and you wonder how much he's actually acting in the role or just being himself. Chaney was never better than he is here, and he's always good value when playing The Wolfman. The distinguished supporting cast are terrific - perhaps the finest cast assembled for a horror movie at the time. Maria Ouspenskya is a real stand-out as Bela's gypsy mother.Jack Peirce's yak-hair makeup itself has dated of course, and is no longer frightening; but as a gloomy fairy tale the movie still works splendidly. One of Universal's biggest hits of the early 40s, The Wolf Man is still fondly remembered and highly regarded. And it deserves to be.

I found a lot to admire and little to dislike. It comes out of a long tradition that dates back to the earliest talkies; attractive, affluent people, living in luxurious apartments\/houses, wearing expensive clothes, dining in expensive restaurants and generally being charming and romantic. We've been there with Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, Grant and Katherine Hepburn, Grant and Ingrid Bergman, Fred and Ginger, Claudette Colbert, Audrey Hepburn, Franchot Tone, Bill Holden, Doris Day, Rock Hudson and now the new generation, epitomized here by Julia Roberts. The story is relatively unimportant, all we ask is twelve reels of escapism, a set piece or two, a song or two, lots of laughter balanced by the odd tear, a soufflé' that segues into a lemon mousse and sends us out into the night with a smile on our face and warmth in our heart. This one delivers as well as any and better than most.
