We don't always know why things work out the way they do; but that's life, for everyone. That's kind of the theme of this slow-developing character study of a damaged man named Mac (Robert Duvall), former country songwriter and singer.The script tells the story of Mac and his life in the slow lane, and his relationship to Rosa (Tess Harper) and others around him. It's a story of simple but genuine folks whose lives center on basic human values like dignity, honesty, and absence of pretense The lonely, barren spaces of West Texas provide the backdrop for the story. As such, the film reminds me of three other films about down home folks set in the rural South Gilbert Grape, Silkwood and The Last Picture Show.There's not much in the way of high drama here; there's no suspense; nor is there any mystery. The entire plot plays out in a natural sort of way, as does life for most people. Things just happen; we ponder why; we move on.Visuals look realistic with natural lighting and lots of wide-angle camera shots. Also adding to the sense of realism is detailed production design appropriate to rural Texas. Film direction, casting, and acting are fairly competent.My only real complaints relate to the slow pace and the music. If the pace had been any slower, the story would have stopped; and with the absence of high drama or anything startling in the plot, some viewers will become bored, as I did during a few segments. Also, I was disappointed with the country songs that were sung. None were memorable. As such, the film's tone was less evocative than it could have been.Slow-moving and very low-key, Tender Mercies offers viewers a plausible and deeply thematic story of life in a rural setting with characters that are believable and fairly likable. Too bad they don't make many films like this anymore.

His nemesis in this is the Green Goblin.I like this film&#x85; I know the Sam Raimi version got slated by a lot of people, but the films were a lot of fun. The feel of this film is very comic book. But that is what I like about it. I felt that with the latest Batman trilogy they took the comic feel away from it and made it into a very dark, realistic feeling movie&#x85; I loved it, but I still preferred the Tim Burton version of Batman because it still had the comic book feel.The effects are not too bad, but at time you can tell that there are a lot of computer generated moments, especially when Peter is sunning along the roof tops.The casting was quite good, but I thought there were some lines and scenes where they delivered the lines so badly. Especially MJs facial expressions at times&#x85; I have to admit, I did laugh at it. Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker\/Spider-Man. He does a great job. I think he is a good actor, but haven't really seen him in much else. Kirsten Dunst plays MJ. Kirsten is a very good actress, but this is not her best work. She has times where she is very convincing, but other times she was quite bad. James Franco plays Peters best friend, Harry. James has grown in leaps and bounds&#x85; he was good in this film. I understand completely why he is as big now as he is. The Green Goblin is played by Willem Defoe... he is an excellent choice for this role. He has the perfect facial expressions for the part and does a brilliant creepy performance. I also really like the cameo appearances from some famous faces&#x85; Stan Lee, WWF Superstar, the late great Macho Man Randy Savage and the legend that is Bruce Campbell.There were parts of this movie that I thought were ridiculous. It just didn't make sense. Peter gets bitten by a spider, it swells up so badly and he feels really ill&#x85; so instead of going to the doctor or hospital he goes home to bed? Really? No-one would ever do this! I also thought it was really funny how MJ was so confused all the way through the movie&#x85; she was so immature for her age. She starts the movie by dating the school meathead, then starts dating Harry, then she has a school girl crush on Spider-Man and then ends the movie telling Peter that she loves him&#x85; Blimey, get a grip woman! It seems that she has no clue as to what love is.This film is a great movie which I will watch again and again. Sam Raimi has done a good job with it and I love the way the whole film feels. A nice little finishing touch was right at the end of the credits&#x85; you get to hear the classic Spider-Man theme tune!

This movie falls under the Film Noir genre, and checks off most if not all of the usual characteristics that a Film Noir has. The alienated lead is none other than Mildred Pierce, majority of Film Noirs have male leads, not to mention that this movie was made int he 1940s when women usually weren't looked at as strong and independent. The female fatale in this movie was Mildred's daughter, Veda, which is also different from most Film Noirs, usually it is the leading mans love interesting that takes on this role. Redemption is also a large element in a Film Noir, and for Mildred Pierce this happens in the end when she if freed from questioning and ultimately freed from her awful daughter Veda, who is finally held accountable for her actions. And lastly the movie is filmed with a dark and angular style, which sets the tone for the movie and gives us hints on how we should feel for whats about to happen. One scene that stuck out to me that used this type of filming was the scene when Wally Fay was locked in Mildred's house, he was frantically running around trying to get out, all the lights were off so there was lost of shadows, making the scene seem even more dark and dangerous. Mildred Pierce was an intriguing movie that kept the audience's attention.
