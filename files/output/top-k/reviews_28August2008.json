The story is engaging, and the sets flawlessly reflect the time period. And yet... it is only a *good* movie. I know that I will probably be hated for saying this, but The Godfather really doesn't seem like a masterpiece. Although it is certainly one of the most influential films of its time, I can't help but feel that it is a little overrated. Perhaps my tastes just aren't the same as everyone else's. And then again... maybe I am right, and a film doesn't have to be perfect to be memorable. The Godfather is worth watching... once... mainly because it has become such an integral part of our culture. It set the stage for epic crime dramas, and that alone is impressive. But... is it really so much better than other films? The first doesn't always have to be the best. The Godfather lays down a very solid foundation for future cinema, much as Gone With the WInd did, way back in the day (don't even get me started on that one). It is by no means perfect, but it is, like I said, worth watching.

It's much better than the overrated Night of the Living Dead or The Evil Dead. The film scares the hell out of you, so, if you don't want to be scared, I recommend it to be seen in broad daylight, but still it would be terrifying. This very David Lynch-ish chiller is incredibly unsettling, uneasy, suspenseful and scary. It's nightmarish, otherworldish sequences are way ahead of it's time and very powerful. The idea of the film being in black and white also adds to the horror and gives the film a dark, film-noir feel to it, which is ruined in the digitally colorized version. I felt the acting was pretty good as well, Candace Hillgloss makes a pretty convincing heroine which is either loosing her mind or is really haunted by the mysterious man who wants her to join him and his dead fellows in the Carnival of Souls. The film, surprisingly, isn't slow-paced, there are things going on all the time, and just when you think it will stop, it only gets scarier and scarier, building up to the fantastic ending. Carnival of Souls is indeed a film you can't afford to miss!

It has made in the 80s written all over it, with Keaton's big mullet, the music and acting styles. My main issue is the complete lack of explanation for anything. I don't see the appeal of hero\/superhero films with no back story. Close to the end we find out Wayne's parents were murdered and that's why he's a bit screwed up, but that's the entire story we get to work with. Why is he dressed as a bat? Why did he become a vigilante? Who makes those toys and vehicles? And Michael Keaton just cannot pull off the role. He is passable as Bruce Wayne, nothing special but he'll do. But as soon as he puts on the suit he suddenly starts walking like some sort of robot. The concepts of style, finesse, flair and cool seem to have completely passed him by. He's just not convincing as a tough hero guy, he looks so awkward in doing anything at all.It just seems to try and be 'cool' for the sake of it. The new Batmobile thing is a military tank spray-painted black with an afterburner to jump gaps. It was designed for a purpose and has a practical use. The Batmobile here, however, looks like some sort of space shuttle with an afterburner that doesn't appear to go particularly fast. It just looks ridiculous. Where did he get it? Does the manufacturer not have suspicions about Batman's identity when he realises he not so long ago was asked to build a rocket car with a bat wing on the roof? As for the Batwing thing, there are no words to describe how terrible that is. It just appears from nowhere, with no explanation, and doesn't look like it could physically get off the ground in that shape. The brief scene where the Batwing popped up above the clouds and lined up with the moon to make the symbol made me want to bang my head on something.And as a side note, why does Batman only appear to be able to glide at a perfectly vertical angle? The opening scene where he lowers onto the rooftops where the guys are counting the money, and then spreads his wings when they turn around and again after he gets shot, is just cringeworthy.Thank god for Nicholson then, the saving grace. His exceptionally manic performance as the Joker is superb, genuinely believable, despite it's ludicrous extremism. Michael Gough and Robert Wuhl also put in fairly decent performances that stand out above the rest.Whilst the direction is good for the most part, and I admire the extremely Gothic art direction Burton has gone for, I can't help but feel Gotham is a bit unconvincing. I know it's a big city, as well as an island, but during those far out landscape shots everything seems so over the top and the city so isolated that it feels less like a sprawling metropolis and more like an over-sized Disneyland with no source of light.And all this is a great shame, because it could have been very good. Had they at least attempted to put in an explanation to anything, got another actor who actually knew how to walk like a human when in the suit and got rid of that spaceship thing then it would probably get another 3 or 4 stars on this review. Perhaps if they had renamed it The Joker (featuring Batman) then it wouldn't have been so bitterly disappointing.

While Passion of Joan of Arc may make us bawl out in tears and City Lights and Sunrise marvel us with the joys of living, The General is just rollicking fun filmed to a perfection within its limitations. It might tell a slightly contrived love story (i.e. she'll only even speak to John if he is in a uniform despite a reasonable explanation why he's declined to fight at first), and some of its special effects sequences are near unbelievable, but Buster Keaton and collaborator Clyde Bruckman are so in control of their elements- of crowds, of the speed and intricacies and idiosyncrasies of the train, of Keaton in the midst of Civil War terror- that it's hard to see it as anything else but a classic of its time and beyond.Just the sheer physicality is incredible; watching Keaton put together these sequences, from the bits of him trying to load up a train with wood to getting onto another rail of tracks to dodge the other cars and just running around and then having the hundreds of soldiers running and fighting and in battle formation, is nearly overwhelming. The General is only 75 minutes but it feels epic and full of grandeur, and its got some hysterical set-pieces to boot (watching Keaton and his female lead getting out of a bear trap is enough to belly laugh and cringe at the same time) on top of its breakneck pacing. In a sense there isn't a whole lot of plot even as it tells a very carefully constructed story in the strictest action-movie sense of the word a man in love with his engine and the girl of his dreams isn't allowed in the army, but nevertheless takes some kind of control over his General train car, and one night overhears of a plot to sabotage his Confederate buddies, which he'll stop in the most insane circumstances imaginable.The General provided me with two things consistently, and didn't let up for its entire running time sheer cinematic prowess the likes of which is equable to the greatest and brawniest of silent pictures where you barely need a title card to keep things moving along (and of all things a train is a really clever vehicle, no pun intended, to keep the action and the story without any real lulls save for Keaton's pratfalls), and Keaton himself as a one-of-a-kind clown. He's not exactly always sweet and delightful in the sense that Chaplin is, but in his very downtrodden and almost serious way he's the best kind of comedian you could ask for in this environment. It's based on a true story, which adds to the appeal of the sort of frowning clown of action- one of the truly spectacular stunt-men even in just loading a gun or bringing out his blade- that Keaton is quintessential in being. And it goes without saying that by the time we get to that bridge blowing up it simply reveals itself as a towering HOW-did-they-do-THAT set piece you couldn't try and fake on a computer.Loaded with sublime craftsmanship and daring-do (and all on the good-guy side of the confederates!), the General is not one to miss. And anyone thinking that a silent film doesn't have the power to keep an audience dulled by empty-headed and soulless and trashy Hollywood entertainments need to look back at this.

Paul Giamatti plays the signature goofy white partner, who occasionally gets pushed around by the neighborhood locals to much comedic success (it is actually pretty funny, if predictable, like everything else here). Nia Long reprises her typical role as the love interest, and then a bunch of goofy physical stunts are taken from Mrs. Doubtfire and given a slightly different flair -- playing on southern black stereotypes (deep fried home cooking, going to church, etc.).This movie is cheesy and ridiculous. I don't think you even need to watch the whole thing, nor watch it twice (though there is a sequel, and seeing that would basically be watching this movie twice). But for what it is, it's pretty goofy and entertaining.4.5 ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"28 August 2008","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Defoe's original novel, even after all these years, is funny, sad, entertaining and fast-moving. The film is basically only sad, with little resemblance to the novel. It is also dreadfully slow in parts. Some of the acting is good- Stockard Channing makes an excellent Madam, and Aisling Corcoran as the little girl is splendid, producing the few flashes of humour, and there are some very nice cameo parts from well-known British and Irish actors. However, Morgan Freeman (normally a very good actor) seems to have a rather variable accent and to be wondering how he got into this film (not quite Dick van Dyke in Mary Poppins, but...), and Robin Wright doesn't really convince me as a lower-class London girl. The costumes and settings give a good impression of what must have been a much less colourful world- particularly effective are the candle-lit indoor scenes. We get an interesting glimpse of the life and customs of late 17th-century\/early 18th century England. However, there are some strange anachronisms- for instance, according to the novel, Moll was born in about 1614, but the clients at Mrs Allworthy's house seem to pay with bank-notes, which would have been extremely unusual at that time. Also I doubt that any little girl (even a feisty one like this) brought up in a Catholic orphanage would have used such strong language. This is nit-picking, I know, and it's only a film, but it's a pity that, with a bit more attention to the story-line and the script, the film could have been so much better.

It is this because of its attention, lucidly surprisingly given its often non-linear structure, to its plot filled with many strands and possible loose ends, and because its director Costa-Gavras injects the story (told deliberately on true events, apparently from recent Greek history) with a taut, exciting and efficient post-modern aesthetic. There is very little time to breathe; one wonders if we might cry at the end not simply because hope seems to be all but lost but because of its breathless attitude and pacing. There's life here, and it's being crushed bit by bit.And, contrary to some criticism, it is not just some piece for liberals or socialist scum as one IMDb reviewer wrote (half) jokingly. On the contrary the story- an investigation into the assassination of a prominent figure of peace, the Deputy as he's called played by Yves Montand, and how a prosecutor (Perier) and a photo-journalist are the only halfway decent and\/or objective ones to sort out the bottom-to-top corruption- is essentially about speaking truth to power in an unjust society. What power, perhaps, is part of the conundrum in this case. Even the top brass attorney general doesn't buy the ultimate sum of the facts tallied by the prosecutor at the end, bringing to the bittersweet (more-so on bitter) end of the tale.Gavras' film is loaded with dialog and inquiry, scenes of tense intimidation and harrowing and jerky inquiry, and the usual set-pieces of action and suspense for a work like this that relies on sometimes documentary approach. The latter of these isn't too frequent, but two prominent sequences (a nasty fight in the back of a pivotal pick-up truck, and a chase by car after a witness) are extraordinary in frenetic energy, cinematography and (strange and cool) music score. The acting is also spot on, from the poker-faced prosecutor to the stalwart General to the dedicated photo-journalist with sneaky tendencies (we don't know for sure if he's legit at first sneaking on on Deputy's grieving widow), and all these fellows in between like a simple non-partisan soccer fan witness, not to mention the deputy's widow herself.Everything just about clicks in Z, and most frightening of all, there's still a feeling of relevancy nearly 40 years later.

The cinematography is quite fresh and original (for '30's drama standards at least). Rudolph Maté received a total of 5 Oscar nominations in his career, all in the '40's, so this movie not included, but he won none of them.Also the subtle little genre musical score from Alfred Newman is great and gets used in all of the right places.It's a great written movie with some wonderful dialog.

Walter Huston and Ruth Chatterton perhaps aren't among the best known '30's actors but they are absolutely great in the movie. Besides playing their roles dramatic they also know to throw in some subtle comical acting as well. The supporting cast features actors such as Mary Astor and David Niven in it. Needless to say that the acting of the movie is really one of the stronger elements.

Some scenes (between MacMurray and Stanwyck) are bad; but the film's defining quality remains. By its mere and physical beauty, by its atmosphere, music, cast, cinematography, DOUBLE &#133; belongs naturally to any top 10 of _noirs. Some scenes could have been better written, and better played. But the sardonic, hallucinatory presentation of evil and decomposing, the caustic, merciless look at the emptiness, are marvelously served by Wilder's talent. Wilder's means are inferior to those of Hitchcock or the great cruel Italians or Buñuel; yet they are considerable nonetheless and there is something deeply satisfying in his best movies. He was not an author; but he was better than most of the other Hollywoodian craftsmen. DOUBLE &#133; is trash turned into a small but imposing work of art. It has energy, drive, atmosphere; it lacks finesse; it is conventional and exhibits an impersonal ready&#151;made cheap fatalism. The characters are unlikable&#151;except for Robinson's ,which is more interesting and even intriguing, and original, than likable. Yesterday I was curious if DOUBLE &#133;,a thriller of the quadruple interest of being a MacMurray, a Stanwyck, a Robinson movie, and a film by Wilder, can also be seen as a love movie, as the film of a passion. DOUBLE &#133; is a hallmark example of style over content. It is able to show more than it really has what. There are good scenes&#151;those not directly involving the MacMurray\/Stanwyck couple as a lovers couple. The heinousness of the murder is Shakespeareian, in the sense that most things of worth are spontaneously Shakespeareian. MacMurray is as good as Mrs. Stanwyck&#151;i.e., very. Robinson is the best&#151;but then again, he was one of the best ever. The attraction supposedly torrid scenes do not work (in the sense that Nicholson made his scenes with Mrs. Lange work indeed). The two actors play, or seem to play other things that those in the script. When I have first seen DOUBLE &#133;,I was mainly impressed with its brutal content, the gloomy unnerving world, the fatalism and hopelessness ,the savageness of the events and the schematic nature of the psychologies&#151;the quality of the portrayal of evil; and also with the unusually good performances. Seen for a second time, DOUBLE &#133; showed the clumsiness and impropriety of some scenes, its failure as a love movie, the lack of passion&#151;in a word, the multiple flaws.

The locale is Montreal and there is a definite French flavor to the movie. The well-known author James Clavell wrote the screenplay and the story switches back and forth from the present to the events of the past few weeks and days, told in flashback sequences. While 'The Fly' adheres to many horror film conventions, such as the zealous scientist going too far in his experiments and 'playing God,' it does so in a more stylish way than most other horror\/sci-fi movies of the fifties. David (here, 'Al') Hedison and Vincent Price star as the scientist and his brother, respectively, but it is really Patricia Owens as Helene Delambre, the scientist's wife, who carries the film. She convincingly relays the maddening ordeal both she and Andre (her husband) must endure once a teleportation experiment of his goes horribly wrong. Alternately panicky then resolved, resolute then terribly frightened, Owens is very good at portraying a woman running the gamut of emotions. At one point, she even feigns insanity to protect her husband and child. Hedison is fine too, in a part that has him wearing a black cloth over his head much of the time. Also worth noting are Herbert Marshall as the police inspector, adding a measure of solemn dignity to the proceedings, and the great character actress Kathleen Freeman as the Delambre's housekeeper. Hedison's Andre, using himself to test the teleporter, finds himself merged with a housefly that was in the device, unnoticed, during the experiment. He then has the head and one arm of the fly, while the fly has the same from him. Andre finds his own identity slipping away in favor of the fly's. A desperate search begins to find the affected fly so that a second experiment, hopefully correcting the first, can take place. It would be easy for the film to become ludicrous at any point but it never does. It's all insanely convincing, including the now-famous ending, when the fly is finally found in a spider's web, about to be eaten, and a close-up shows us Andre's face, his expression a crazed look of pure terror as the spider approaches, his tiny voice screaming, Help me! Help me! To paraphrase Inspector Charas, who kills both fly and spider with a rock, it's an ending no moviegoer is likely to forget. 'The Fly' was a medium-budget film and it surprised everyone involved by becoming a huge hit, grossing over six times its cost.

The Postman is a nice little sci-fi parable that wants to be epic so much that it forgets the word subtlety. It presents itself as epic far beyond historical epics, beyond sword and sorcery epics. Yes, we have reached the definition of epic as applied in comic books. Here he comes to save the day! It's the Postman! No, Kevin Costner doesn't fly or wear a cape. Not in the literal sense. He does come eerily close at times, however. At one point a boy holds out a letter &#150; holding it up towards the heavens from an ultra-low angle (a la a comic book frame) &#150; as the Postman rides at full gallop (in slow motion) past the kid and snatches his letter up. Later, Costner flies &#150; er, rides &#150; in a cable car across a river so he can pose for the uplifting montage where hope is spread across the land.You can feel every inch of the celluloid about to break a blood vessel in its intense strain to touch the audience (or impress the Oscar voters.) It's quite disheartening when the story is quite the stroke of genius and quite capable of standing on its own without all the dramatic posturing, thank you very much. In true sci-fi form, David Brin exploits a mundane aspect of everyday life and uses the unthinkable as the salvation for a scattered and dying race. In a post-apocalyptic world where most technology (and with it, long range communication\/transportation) has fallen, governments have collapsed, a simple letter reaching its destination inspires an entire town which in turn inspires a revolution.So, my question is why the hell is this movie so eager to run over this brilliant concept for the sake of the hackneyed spectacle that is its presentation? Early in the film (okay, about 45 minutes into this 3 hour journey) Costner swears in Ford L. Mercury as a fellow postman. Costner, of course, only stumbled upon the Postman uniform by accident and wore it because he was cold, wet, and the skeleton didn't need it anymore. Thus, he's a fraud standing face to face with an aspiring lad who wants to be a post man just like him! So in typical Hollywood fashion Costner makes up a story in the typically awkward and unconvincing delivery that such scenes require; he eventually swears the lad in with an oath he reads off the engraving on a nearby wall &#133; and Costner quite blatantly reads it off the board. In a comedy, I'd of gone with it and laughed.

You're full of crap! Get the hell out! and actually stick to his guns. Yes, I rooted and cheered for the Sheriff of Pineview right up until he pulled out a letter in a dramatic after thought, after which I started counting the Hollywood gimmicks.In all fairness, many films I like fall victim to these same contrivances without complaint.

The Postman is a nice little sci-fi parable that wants to be epic so much that it forgets the word subtlety. It presents itself as epic far beyond historical epics, beyond sword and sorcery epics. Yes, we have reached the definition of epic as applied in comic books. Here he comes to save the day! It's the Postman! No, Kevin Costner doesn't fly or wear a cape. Not in the literal sense. He does come eerily close at times, however. At one point a boy holds out a letter &#150; holding it up towards the heavens from an ultra-low angle (a la a comic book frame) &#150; as the Postman rides at full gallop (in slow motion) past the kid and snatches his letter up. Later, Costner flies &#150; er, rides &#150; in a cable car across a river so he can pose for the uplifting montage where hope is spread across the land.You can feel every inch of the celluloid about to break a blood vessel in its intense strain to touch the audience (or impress the Oscar voters.) It's quite disheartening when the story is quite the stroke of genius and quite capable of standing on its own without all the dramatic posturing, thank you very much. In true sci-fi form, David Brin exploits a mundane aspect of everyday life and uses the unthinkable as the salvation for a scattered and dying race. In a post-apocalyptic world where most technology (and with it, long range communication\/transportation) has fallen, governments have collapsed, a simple letter reaching its destination inspires an entire town which in turn inspires a revolution.So, my question is why the hell is this movie so eager to run over this brilliant concept for the sake of the hackneyed spectacle that is its presentation? Early in the film (okay, about 45 minutes into this 3 hour journey) Costner swears in Ford L. Mercury as a fellow postman. Costner, of course, only stumbled upon the Postman uniform by accident and wore it because he was cold, wet, and the skeleton didn't need it anymore. Thus, he's a fraud standing face to face with an aspiring lad who wants to be a post man just like him! So in typical Hollywood fashion Costner makes up a story in the typically awkward and unconvincing delivery that such scenes require; he eventually swears the lad in with an oath he reads off the engraving on a nearby wall &#133; and Costner quite blatantly reads it off the board. In a comedy, I'd of gone with it and laughed. In this movie, I wanted Ford to &#150; I dunno &#150; notice and call him on it.In fact, when all the sheep were following this horrible liar, and when the audience should be touched by the good-heartedness of the film's intentions, I just wanted someone to say, Hey pal! You're full of crap! Get the hell out! and actually stick to his guns. Yes, I rooted and cheered for the Sheriff of Pineview right up until he pulled out a letter in a dramatic after thought, after which I started counting the Hollywood gimmicks.In all fairness, many films I like fall victim to these same contrivances without complaint.

She hires a successful doctor to diagnose her to see if that is necessary. What results is much more dramatic and shocking than most of them can realize.The three stars here shine like no others. Clift is steady and solid as the persistent doctor, even though he looks pretty run down in most scenes. Hepburn is her usual reliable self, but Taylor gives a great performance as a girl who witnessed a horrible event that has affected her greatly so that no one around her knows how to deal with it. She is completely believable in all her scenes and gives a great sense of trying to walk the fine line between sanity and insanity. The movie does suffer some with its lack of any real type of cinema action.

The animation here is certainly nice when compared to Disney's television shows, but like other Disney cartoons from this era (Pocahontas, The Emperor's New Groove) the lines are simple, the colors are a bit flat and the cast seems to be on auto-pilot. Yeah, Mulan isn't a Disney film that I would say was particularly inspired.The musical numbers by Jerry Goldsmith are pretty droll and even offensive (for instance, the fat Chinese soldier character sings about how his ideal woman would know how to cook beef, chicken and pork; you know, like on a Chinese food menu?). Donny Osmond sings the main theme song for Mulan's training montage. I don't like Osmond, but the song is actually flawed by the weak and tepid songwriting, not the vocal performance. Most of the songs here are memorable because they're so laughably awful. I mean, compared to Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin or The Lion King the songs here are not even in the same ballpark.Eddie Murphy isn't laugh-out-loud hilarious, but he's the only saving grace of the film. He voices a sassy supporting role, Mulan's pet dragon and best friend, and is the only entertaining part of the film. He's a little miscast, but is also somehow the only substantial character. For instance, the villains (here it's the Mongolian Horde, ancient China's consistent historical adversary) have such little character depth -- not to mention humanity. I know Disney films paint the world in simplistic shades of good and evil, but good golly... the Mongolians are depicted here as a collective race of monsters! They're given no incentive or individual reason for existence. And I don't recall seeing any female Mongolians either. Their whole depiction is clumsy and comes across as ignorant. Also, it's kind of weird that Mulan falls in love with a tough guy who, well... beats her into shape. The film's not unwatchable, it's just really mediocre. The use of the CGI makes it clear that Disney was just about finished with their signature (historically significant) hand-drawn animated works. But Mulan comes nowhere close to any of Disney's back catalog. To any parents looking for a good Disney animated film to watch with their kids, go for anything before Pocahontas. Mulan is lackluster in the departments of charm, pacing, songwriting and memorability. I've heard the more recent animated Disney film Lilo & Stitch was much better, so maybe I should check that out.
