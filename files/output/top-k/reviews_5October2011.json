Maybe even top 3. But I suppose it was a lesson in judging a movie by its following. True, though many DD fans are confused teens who listen to too much Insane Clown Posse and frequent Hot Topics, this movie is actually great. Really. I must've watched this movie over 20 times by the end of my second week with it. The story is just fantastic, the casting was excellent, and the score\/soundtrack is flawless. Without bringing up all the things I have to say about this movie and muddling up the review, I WILL say that this movie, when interpreted correctly (sorry Hot Topic fans, this movie is NOT just about a kid with schizophrenia. That completely destroys the potential magnitude of this film), can lead to hours and hours of discussion. I talked for weeks about this movie, and my friend (who loaned it to me) and I had conversations that took us to very profound places...You can tell a movie is great when it changed something about your personality. Just like seeing Batman for the first time as a kid had me running around in a batman costume for over two years of my life, this movie has changed me. Which if you think about it, is the greatest thing art can do, right? I compare Donnie Darko to Casablanca, in the sense that it was a movie that is too good to have come from the conditions it was made under. By now it may not be clear why this is ranked a 7 out of 10, because I liked the movie so goddamn much. This is because I am talking about the Director's Cut only. The Director's Cut is flawless, except for one or two things I might have done differently, but these things are trivial. The theatrical version for me left a lot to be desired, and had a few bad notes in it that killed the mood for me. I know a lot of people firmly prefer the theatrical, but if you were to see the Director's Cut, you would know that it is everything the original was meant to be and so much more. Richard Kelly says it himself on most of the commentary over deleted scenes in the theatrical release. A lot of these scenes he considered (rightly so) to be very important to the film as a whole, but was forced to cut it due to the constraining time limit at Sundance (I think he had to cut 20-30 minutes in total, I can't recall now). Trust me when I say that the scenes cut REALLY enhance the experience, and I'm thinking of one in particular that made the movie for me. Also, Kelly adds a lot. Remember that the Director's Cut was made in 04, giving Kelly a lot of time to mull over what he really wanted his masterpiece to SAY. A lot of great effects are added that give it more of an art house film vibe. It truly is amazing, and though I understand the sentiments to the original (I don't like the remastered Star Wars just as much as everyone else), in the end it's a better movie. Really. But the theatrical I would rate at about a 7.But anyway, this movie's good, and if you're weary of it it's not as weird as your goth friends say it is. It's just original. And they're kinda dumb.

There are certain things that make me cringe, and either cover my ears, or avert my eyes, depending on what's going on. Now, there is no quicksand in the film; nor does a dog lick a person's face while the person seems to like it. Fair enough--but even with that really horrendous stuff not making a showing in this film, I am forced, instead, to endure the following (1) A character slices her finger with a knife while chopping carrots (this sort of thing, or someone cutting himself shaving, gives me the creeping willies). True, gratuitous blood oozing on the finger is kept to a polite minimum, but on to (2) A character is forced to mercy-kill an injured animal by twisting its neck (practice for the same maneuver naturally being applied to a villainous human). Always a toughie for me, and this is one where the hands fly to the ears.(3) A character takes a tumble on some skates, and cracko goes a bone. See also THE DARK KNIGHT. Again, I'm supposed to feel let off the hook, somewhat, because we don't actually see a bone snapping and jutting out of a limb (see, for this, DEEP RISING, or THE FLY (1986); also starring Geena Davis, who seems to be some kind of marker for films ready to snap bones). But by this time I know that what is lacking in the visuals is being made up for in a sort of sound assault, exacerbated by(4) Villain brandishes pretty much the evilest-looking knife on the planet while threatening a bound torture victim. This is of course a lead-in to a rather terrible sound as this blade from hell is finally put to use. Why do I tell you all this? Why turn a review into a Sickens-Me-Most List when I should be commenting on action, or pace, or characterization? Well, the movie's constant desire to make a squeamish viewer cringe using odd and sickening gimmicks--even sounds--is a good way of saying that the film has a personality unique in spy flicks. Especially when you throw in a Shane Black script as directed by Renny Harlin. Nauseating sounds, disturbing scenes, faces washed and scrubbed only to be bloodied again in the next round of action...it's hard to concentrate on the wickedly playful script. The film sometimes seems to be poking at the viewer, sticking toothpicks under the fingernails and lighting matches between the toes, and having Jim Carrey somehow present even here to provide The Most Annoying Sound In The World, in brief spurts, all while it zings along at frog-tongue speed and fits the cool repartee in between pain sounds.It is so uniquely and unrelentingly nasty in its effect that I find I love it. It also helps that a few of my favorite people worked on this film. Samuel L. Jackson--well, he helps immeasurably in moving this up several subsections of notches. David Morse plays it so calmly and devilishly compared to all the frenzy bouncing around him, that he's a welcome quiet talker. Brian Cox fits into these spy films effortlessly, seeming like a guy who could have trained a killer, or hired a killer to solve a problem--and he gets some terrific lines. G. D. Spradlin--never out of place, and here gives a quick but tough-talking turn as the US President. And as for the homemaker turned spy herself--Geena Davis--while I confess that she is not one of my all-time favorite leading ladies, I loved her in THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST, and here at the opposite end of the Universe known as THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT, she gives us one of the best female action heroines in a movie. Basically playing two characters in one, she successfully burns the scented candle which is really a stick of dynamite at both ends.Plus, I'm never one to disrespect an Alan Silvestri soundtrack...though I would say that jarring, rabbit-punch of sound he likes to apply only adds to the general edginess of the noise factor present in this film.As for Renny Harlin; hey, he has his detractors and I'm not one of them. Over and over a again, when I need a fun time with broken brakes, I watch CLIFFHANGER, DIE HARD 2, DEEP BLUE SEA, MINDHUNTERS, and of course THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT. I love his snow and his gunplay and his carnage. I love his pace, and that ham-fisted impishness that gets stamped on things. This particular film shows that with a great script and a twisty spy premise, he can spin gold. Even if it does make me grit my teeth at something kind of vile every 10 minutes.

Again, I'm supposed to feel let off the hook, somewhat, because we don't actually see a bone snapping and jutting out of a limb (see, for this, DEEP RISING, or THE FLY (1986); also starring Geena Davis, who seems to be some kind of marker for films ready to snap bones). But by this time I know that what is lacking in the visuals is being made up for in a sort of sound assault, exacerbated by(4) Villain brandishes pretty much the evilest-looking knife on the planet while threatening a bound torture victim. This is of course a lead-in to a rather terrible sound as this blade from hell is finally put to use. Why do I tell you all this? Why turn a review into a Sickens-Me-Most List when I should be commenting on action, or pace, or characterization? Well, the movie's constant desire to make a squeamish viewer cringe using odd and sickening gimmicks--even sounds--is a good way of saying that the film has a personality unique in spy flicks. Especially when you throw in a Shane Black script as directed by Renny Harlin. Nauseating sounds, disturbing scenes, faces washed and scrubbed only to be bloodied again in the next round of action...it's hard to concentrate on the wickedly playful script. The film sometimes seems to be poking at the viewer, sticking toothpicks under the fingernails and lighting matches between the toes, and having Jim Carrey somehow present even here to provide The Most Annoying Sound In The World, in brief spurts, all while it zings along at frog-tongue speed and fits the cool repartee in between pain sounds.It is so uniquely and unrelentingly nasty in its effect that I find I love it. It also helps that a few of my favorite people worked on this film. Samuel L. Jackson--well, he helps immeasurably in moving this up several subsections of notches. David Morse plays it so calmly and devilishly compared to all the frenzy bouncing around him, that he's a welcome quiet talker. Brian Cox fits into these spy films effortlessly, seeming like a guy who could have trained a killer, or hired a killer to solve a problem--and he gets some terrific lines. G. D. Spradlin--never out of place, and here gives a quick but tough-talking turn as the US President. And as for the homemaker turned spy herself--Geena Davis--while I confess that she is not one of my all-time favorite leading ladies, I loved her in THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST, and here at the opposite end of the Universe known as THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT, she gives us one of the best female action heroines in a movie. Basically playing two characters in one, she successfully burns the scented candle which is really a stick of dynamite at both ends.Plus, I'm never one to disrespect an Alan Silvestri soundtrack...though I would say that jarring, rabbit-punch of sound he likes to apply only adds to the general edginess of the noise factor present in this film.As for Renny Harlin; hey, he has his detractors and I'm not one of them. Over and over a again, when I need a fun time with broken brakes, I watch CLIFFHANGER, DIE HARD 2, DEEP BLUE SEA, MINDHUNTERS, and of course THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT. I love his snow and his gunplay and his carnage. I love his pace, and that ham-fisted impishness that gets stamped on things.

While I can certainly agree with that statement to an extent, for me this film, although enjoyable, was nothing particularly amazing. Bella does deliver a timeless performance as the blood thirsty count, but as someone who has grown up with shows and movies about vampires that mock the older myths, ie. True Blood, Cirque De Freak, et al... it seems to me as though this film was lacking. It is clearly understood that why this film was so revered in its time among both the common viewer as as cinema aficionados, but several elements of the film left me feeling quite disappointed. To be sure, all the scenes where Dracula is flying around as a bat are nothing short of hilarious, and while many would say that any laugh is a good laugh, for a film of such a serious nature that deals with the mortal questions of life and death, I do not feel as though laughter would be well served. I am almost certain that is not the response the filmmakers were hoping to elicit from their viewers. Secondly among this list of shortcomings was the character of Remfield. In Remfield the filmmakers had the chance to exploit and further a truly despicable character that would almost strike as much fear in the viewer as Dracula himself; however, the film never turned that corner, so to speak. While the close-up of Remfield staring maniacally on the bottom of the stairs after the boat massacre was indeed quite eerie and bone-chilling, I feel as though so much more could have done with that quality of unique character. That being said, it is not my intent to tear this film apart, for it is a piece of classic American filmmaking that does deserve a place in the annals of history, both for its grand performances, as well as its overall mis-en-sene. That, the overall feel of the film that is, is one area that was certainly not lacking or deficient in any way. I was able to relate to, or at the very least empathize with, the villagers fear of the night and all the things that it brought out.

Films such as The Exorcist, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween may be classed as the best of all time, they have also proved too much for the mainstream, who like their horror slightly more psychological, less physical and most often promising a happy ending.This may explain why master filmmaker John Carpenter's 1982 powerhouse science-fiction horror 'The Thing' did so poorly at the cinema box office, besides the unfortunate fact that the darling of Hollywood, Steven Spielberg, had released E.T The Extra Terrestrial at the same time.The film is cold, dark, uncompromising, you can cut the paranoid and petrified atmosphere with a knife, but you'd do better to incinerate it with a flamethrower just to feel that little bit safer before you go to bed. There are no warm and endearing characters to care for, every moment this mysterious but absurdly terrifying Thing from another world strikes, you are left with goosebumps, your imagination running scared and out of control and in the end... have you made up your mind how the end will come? An American Scientific Research base isolated in the Antarctic finds itself witness to an incident where the members of a not too distant Norwegian base have seemingly gone mad. The Norwegians are killed in regrettable circumstances. leaving no answers as to their actions leaving chronically drunk and depressed helicopter pilot MacReady with no choice but to fly a couple of the concerned scientists over to the Norwegian base where they discover a horrific aftermath of grisly death and destruction. The remains of a mutated and seemingly inhuman corpse is found within the cinders of a burned out bonfire and very quickly the tone is set and the scientists' reality turned upside down.Aliens are amongst us! Very quickly, shock and disgust turn to fear, fear gives birth to anger and paranoia sets in deep as the remaining life-form next targets the American base and secretly multiplies within their ranks in the hopes of outnumbering the remaining humans before it is discovered and destroyed.Hopes of containing the alien life-form, before it is discovered that it is not only an intelligent life-form but also a very contagious one, fade very quickly as the whiskey and sleep deprived R.J. MacReady - played with literal ice cold awesomeness by the one and only Kurt Russell - and the few men he feels he can trust begin to fall apart under the strain of fear and isolation, setting themselves apart from those they feel will only lessen their chances of survival.As time grows short and the numbers die off, it becomes clear that nobody can be trusted and the only way of stopping this nightmare is by effectively ending their very own chances of survival.Carpenter writes possibly his best ever script, the scenes setting the way for a nightmarish Cold War paranoia tale where the fate of the world could very well be put at risk by the fears of a handful of men. There is nowhere to run and hide. Outside, Antarctic Winter is setting in and deadly sub-zero temperatures make it impossible to escape. Where safety in numbers ought to make a man feel safe, the danger is multiplied and to sit alone in the dark is practically suicide. The dog pound is a slaughterhouse, the medical bay is contaminated, people are losing their minds and cabin fever is setting in and the Thing never sleeps...An eerie theme by musical genius Ennio Morricone sets the tone; dark, depressed, suspenseful and doom-inspired. Master of animatronic special-effects Rick Bottin provides the most ghastly practical horrors ever devoted to film and a craftily untypical and notably mature ensemble cast (Kurt Russell, Keith David, Donald Moffat, Thomas G. Waites and Wilford Brimley) provide a sense of reality that no kid that wants to make yet another slasher\/zombie flick could ever hope to.If you haven't seen this film before and for some reason you have an intolerance to anything outside of CGI, pop music soundtracks, laugh a minute characters and damsels in distress in any shape or form then I dare you to see what a real horror film is and watch this. Call it an education because there is not a director out there who will ever rival John Carpenter or make a film as cold and creepy as The Thing!

Watched a pirate version who have 45 minutes of extra footage. The studio doesn't read the script, think M. Shalaman - Mel Gibson and see a lot of money. But when the film was over, and see them in private, claims terrorized its about drugs! then they cut the film and find a quick resolve to the movie. What see in the full version? The aliens not come to eat or conquer the earth. they come to the solar system, a place lack of space authorities, to watch a huge rock concert in Saturn. maybe a 20 or 50 Millons of attendance. Water only kills them in mass quantity, but in low dosis is like opium for the humans. in the middle of the show some alien says, wow the third planet is full of h2o. OMG really? A then, public, crew and even the artists come desperately to earth. Why are so stupid when they walk on earth? because are so stoned!! never was an a classical mars attack film. remember the scene when Mel and his family gets out of the basement? the tapped windows perforated with strange figures? the aliens are do this because they was in a middle of psychedelic trip. The authorities gone mad, even make a short war against other countries in the confusion, but quickly they admitted all the concealment about ufo's and extraterrestial life forms. lots of aliens dies and people in earth help them with their drug problemJojo its a sarcastic commentary no watch this movie please it's good film but awful and nonsense argument!
