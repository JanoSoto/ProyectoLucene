Performance wise this movie is great, you have some good material from Stowe and Willis but most importantly Pitt (got Golden Globe for best supporting actor and was nominated for an Academy Award) who adds in a looney performance similar to his role in Fight Club. The script was good, there was life in each character. This movie isn't only an imaginative physcological trip but an emotional one at well, the ending being sad. I still feel Blade Runner (directors cut) is the best science fiction film ever made and the novel (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) is probably also the best science fiction novel.

The story is quite interesting, but leaves a lot to be desired. I don't see why this had to be a comedy. If they made a drama out of this, it would have been much better. Some of the elements were downright tragic, such as the wife beating scene and the poor youngest child who had to hide behind his hood. These things were acted out well and gave food for thought, but the overall quality of the movie was uneven. Nothing wrong with the acting here, the mother and the father were good characters, as well as some of the children. Tariq, the youngest boy whose name I forgot and the boy who hanged out with him were well made. The oldest son, the girl and the other boys had less depth and left me thinking the writers didn't know what to do with them. Tariq's girlfriend and her fat best friend were stereotypical and boring characters, as well as the other family who wanted to give their daughters to marriage.The humor seemed terribly forced. Some of the scenes were funny, but none left me roaring with laughter. Most of the humor was just old and uninspired. How about coming up with your own jokes before making a comedy? There's been talk here about the profanity, and it didn't bother me, but profanity isn't enough to make a good joke. There's a double standard in the movie. The traditional culture's view of women is shown as sexist and bad, while the western-world beauty ideals are presented as good and natural. A fat girl clinging on a boy and following her best friend even on a date? Pleease. What about the ugly brides of the boys? The mother tells them you are not good enough for my boys - even though the girls did nothing but looked bad. Soo sexist. This might be funny for men, but as a woman, I was only offended to see this stuff. It's stereotypical and just simply not funny. The other stereotype is with gays. A young man doesn't want to get married - he's gay! Look, he's a hairdresser! Soo gay. Is that funny? NO. If humor has to rely on stereotypes, it shows lack of creativity. Make this movie again with more drama and less stupid humor. Make all the children characters in their own right and include more discussion on the cultural problems and domestic violence, and you've got a great movie.

The back story to the original film is revealed and it quite good but the movie falls apart when it should deliver.The film opens up with a Native American being given a spirit to help combat a strong presence located back on the property in which the house from the 1st film was located. He senses that the family is in trouble and goes on a search for them.The movie eventually reveals the real reason behind the first haunting and why the Poltergeists are back again. The movies' main villain is The Preacher Kane. He will do anything to get Carol Anne back to lead him and his followers into the light. All of this is quite interesting but the movie fails to deliver on its premise. For one, there are way too many false scares. Characters dream about being pulled underground by dead bodies. Dead bodies appear in a mirror. Dead bodies which turn out to be closet items appear. This really cheats the audience. Also, take the scene where about 50 ghosts are walking on the lawn. You look at that and get a chill but then, we never see them again. We hear some beating and stomping in the house and that is it. And another scene has a character in grave danger only for it to suddenly go away. Was he actually in trouble? When the ghosts come back, they do so through a plastic toy telephone and Heather O'Rourke delivers a weak They're Back line. No where near as chilling as They're here.The acting in this film is very good and keeps the movie from sinking. Once again, you really feel for these people. JoBeth Williams is effective but not as good as she was in the first film. Julian Beck is quite scary but he isn't given much to do and the film could have benefited from more scenes with him. And of course, I still think Zelda Rubinstein was born to play Tangina and her presence is always welcome.There is a lot to like in this film, but you will walk away from it feeling empty, especially about the forced funny final moments. It is far superior to the 3rd film but the first one can't be beat.   ","genre":null},{"date":"31 January 2003","score":"","review":"  Poltergeist II is a good movie lost in a bad one.

That's what comes to my mind as I think about it. There's a great story here (actually a number of stories, intricately woven together into a whole.) There are some fantastic performances. Tom Hanks was good as always, although I didn't think he quite lived up to his Oscar winning performances in Forrest Gump or Philadelphia. Michael Clarke Duncan perfectly captured the character of the mysterious John Coffey. Was he a child murderer or not? That question will be answered in the movie. But there are still more questions about him that are (appropriately, I think) left to the viewers' imagination. Is he a human with special healing powers or is he some sort of supernatural being - an angel, perhaps? We don't know. But stealing the show I thought was Doug Hutchison as the sadistic prison guard Percy Wetmore. He fits the (admittedly unfair) stereotype of a prison guard a pathetic little loser who makes himself feel like a man by abusing inmates. Hutchison was excellent.So if the story and performances are great, why do I say that the movie is only on the edge of greatness? To be quite honest, I can't quite put my finger on it but something here just didn't quite work for me. I found my attention wandering from time to time. True, it's a very long movie (well over three hours) but it wasn't really the length. Maybe there just seemed to be a lot of extraneous detail that seemed to obscure the main focus of the movie, which should have remained on Coffey throughout. Maybe it was the setting of the movie as a flashback. (I found the beginning and ending in the nursing home totally unnecessary, and would have liked the focus to be simply on the Green Mile.) I'm not sure what it was, but it just didn't quite make the grade to a great movie for me. Very good, but not quite great, although it's worth noting that Stephen King was apparently very pleased with this adaptation of his book.

Lucas is technical director not an actors one and it shows.It would have been a wise choice to let his mate, fellow Beard, Steven Speilberg to have a bash at directing an episode to show how incompetent Lucas really is when it comes to telling a story. Even Peter 'Bad Taste' Jackson would be more than an ample choice at helming an episode as he has definitely proved his worth with the first two Lord of the Rings installments.A word of advice George, give it up while you're still in front. Episodes IV - VI are great films and that's what they'll be remembered for, not some money making scheme that the new films appear to be.

I found the copy we own and put it in the tape player. I can say only one thing I absolutely love this movie!!!!! I had so much fun watching it. I even clapped when it was over! Tim Burton's charming, witty, and flawless comedy is a major contender for the most unique movie of all time. Other than that it's entertaining from beginning to end. Johnny Depp captures the hilarity and ineptitude of Edward D. Wood Jr., a name synonymous with many people and one of the first thoughts that will come to mind when the term bad movie is brought up. Depp will crack you up as he takes you through the many ups and not too distant downs of Wood's career. Watching this movie has left me under the impression that Depp is a fabulous actor (which I'm sure he is), and I really want to check out more of his movies. In fact, Depp's portrayal was so great, it's one of the best performances I have ever seen. The movie begins with Wood attending his own play at an old shack on a rainy night, and the audience members are either asleep or talking with one another. Despite being slated in the papers, Wood still focuses on the rare positive comments such as `The soldiers' clothes looked realistic' rather than face the fact that his production stunk. Later that night, Wood tells his wife about his worries of making it in Hollywood, and she assures him that things will get better. After being rejected for the directing job of `I Changed My Sex', Wood meets Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), who is now old, washed up, and out of a job. Plus, very few people know he's still alive. But Wood is thrilled and wants to cast him in a movie. Ed convinces the creator of `I Changed My Sex' to let him direct it and gets the job. He writes the script, changing the title to `Glen or Glenda'. It is after his wife's reading of the script that she finds Wood in female clothing, revealing his passion for wearing it. `Glen or Glenda' proves to be so bad that it only premieres in Alabama, Missouri, and Indiana. He later slews together several misfits such as wrestler Tor Johnson (George Steele), future-predicting Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), and Lugosi for his next movie called `Bride of The Atom', which is renamed `Bride of The Monster'. Despite being kicked out of the perfect studio for not paying, he still goes on without any doubt. He gets the owner of a meat butchering company to pay for the film after two unsuccessful donation parties. And for the exciting climax, he has Bela Lugosi fight a giant rubber octopus. At the premiere, the cast is pelted with concessions and garbage, and they make it out just in time to catch a taxi, missing the entire movie. Later on, Ed learns that Lugosi, who had admitted earlier that he was addicted to drugs, has just died. He is heartbroken, and as a tribute, his movie, `Grave Robbers From Outer Space', is billed as the final film of Bela Lugosi. Since Wood is in a tight spot financially, he seals a deal with his apartment landlord to help him make the film. His associates provide ideas that he doesn't like, making him disgruntled. But when he gets an inspirational speech from his lifelong hero Orson Welles (Vincent D'Onofrio), he is once again motivated to finish the movie, renamed `Plan 9 From Outer Space'. After finishing the film, Wood claims that it will be the film that they remember him by. And he receives a standing ovation at the premiere. This is a one-of-a-kind film. What's so funny about the ending is that it takes the common `character gets discouraged, character gets inspirational speech and advice, character gets back in and wins' element and adds a funny and different kind of twist to it. The same can be said about the story in general, which tells the story of one of the worst directors of all time rather than show you the times of a successful figure. It's hard to pick the best scene, but I especially loved when the three men were previewing Glen or Glenda (`Pull the string! Pull the string!'). I also liked the scene where the guy couldn't tell the difference between the red and green dresses that Loretta King had to pick since he was colorblind, which is funny since the entire film is in black and white. The performances of Wood's common associates and cast members are inspiring and fun to watch, and I also have to give plenty of credit to Juliet Landau for being really hot. All of the famous moments of his career are captured perfectly, and there's even a touching subplot that shows how much Wood loved Lugosi. Landau definitely deserved the Academy Award he received, for he too does a great job playing his part. He even delivered some of the movie's best lines. Bill Murray also has a fun to watch performance during the show. \t Even if you're not into Ed Wood's movies or his career, you'll still be greatly entertained by Burton's out-of-this-world movie. A big recommendation, especially if you need a different kind of movie to crack you up. So sit back and enjoy, because you won't see another movie like this for a long, long time. ***** out of *****  ","genre":null},{"date":"31 January 2003","score":"","review":"  After being entertained by Plan 9 From Outer Space, I was pretty excited to check this out.

In fact, Depp's portrayal was so great, it's one of the best performances I have ever seen. The movie begins with Wood attending his own play at an old shack on a rainy night, and the audience members are either asleep or talking with one another. Despite being slated in the papers, Wood still focuses on the rare positive comments such as `The soldiers' clothes looked realistic' rather than face the fact that his production stunk. Later that night, Wood tells his wife about his worries of making it in Hollywood, and she assures him that things will get better. After being rejected for the directing job of `I Changed My Sex', Wood meets Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), who is now old, washed up, and out of a job. Plus, very few people know he's still alive. But Wood is thrilled and wants to cast him in a movie. Ed convinces the creator of `I Changed My Sex' to let him direct it and gets the job. He writes the script, changing the title to `Glen or Glenda'. It is after his wife's reading of the script that she finds Wood in female clothing, revealing his passion for wearing it. `Glen or Glenda' proves to be so bad that it only premieres in Alabama, Missouri, and Indiana. He later slews together several misfits such as wrestler Tor Johnson (George Steele), future-predicting Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), and Lugosi for his next movie called `Bride of The Atom', which is renamed `Bride of The Monster'. Despite being kicked out of the perfect studio for not paying, he still goes on without any doubt. He gets the owner of a meat butchering company to pay for the film after two unsuccessful donation parties. And for the exciting climax, he has Bela Lugosi fight a giant rubber octopus. At the premiere, the cast is pelted with concessions and garbage, and they make it out just in time to catch a taxi, missing the entire movie. Later on, Ed learns that Lugosi, who had admitted earlier that he was addicted to drugs, has just died. He is heartbroken, and as a tribute, his movie, `Grave Robbers From Outer Space', is billed as the final film of Bela Lugosi. Since Wood is in a tight spot financially, he seals a deal with his apartment landlord to help him make the film. His associates provide ideas that he doesn't like, making him disgruntled. But when he gets an inspirational speech from his lifelong hero Orson Welles (Vincent D'Onofrio), he is once again motivated to finish the movie, renamed `Plan 9 From Outer Space'. After finishing the film, Wood claims that it will be the film that they remember him by. And he receives a standing ovation at the premiere. This is a one-of-a-kind film. What's so funny about the ending is that it takes the common `character gets discouraged, character gets inspirational speech and advice, character gets back in and wins' element and adds a funny and different kind of twist to it. The same can be said about the story in general, which tells the story of one of the worst directors of all time rather than show you the times of a successful figure. It's hard to pick the best scene, but I especially loved when the three men were previewing Glen or Glenda (`Pull the string! Pull the string!'). I also liked the scene where the guy couldn't tell the difference between the red and green dresses that Loretta King had to pick since he was colorblind, which is funny since the entire film is in black and white. The performances of Wood's common associates and cast members are inspiring and fun to watch, and I also have to give plenty of credit to Juliet Landau for being really hot. All of the famous moments of his career are captured perfectly, and there's even a touching subplot that shows how much Wood loved Lugosi. Landau definitely deserved the Academy Award he received, for he too does a great job playing his part. He even delivered some of the movie's best lines. Bill Murray also has a fun to watch performance during the show. \t Even if you're not into Ed Wood's movies or his career, you'll still be greatly entertained by Burton's out-of-this-world movie. A big recommendation, especially if you need a different kind of movie to crack you up. So sit back and enjoy, because you won't see another movie like this for a long, long time. ***** out of *****  ","genre":"Biography, Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"31 January 2003","score":"","review":"  After being entertained by Plan 9 From Outer Space, I was pretty excited to check this out. I found the copy we own and put it in the tape player. I can say only one thing I absolutely love this movie!!!!! I had so much fun watching it. I even clapped when it was over! Tim Burton's charming, witty, and flawless comedy is a major contender for the most unique movie of all time. Other than that it's entertaining from beginning to end. Johnny Depp captures the hilarity and ineptitude of Edward D. Wood Jr., a name synonymous with many people and one of the first thoughts that will come to mind when the term bad movie is brought up.

Only a director such as Oliver Stone, who is not afraid to take risks and say what needs to be said could make a set of films so daring and powerful that they almost beg to be watched. For those who don't know Stone himself fought in Vietnam. He has since made, not only three of the best films on Vietnam, but three of the best war films period. The first is the award-winning Platoon, followed by Born on the Fourth of July and finally this one. What makes this trilogy so good is that instead of making three war films he has made on war film and two other character studies to accent it. Also these films are not just about huge battles and high body counts like a lot of today's war films. Stone is just as concerned in showing the war going on inside every man on the battle field just as much as the war at hand. Platoon was based on Stone's personal experience in Vietnam, he made an atmosphere where every step could bring death and there was no sympathy. It was hailed as a masterpiece, winning Stone an Oscar for best director and also placing it as one of the greatest war films ever made. Instead of travelling back to Vietnam, Stone decided to follow up Platoon with a look into the decayed life of a worn down veteran. When We Were Soldiers came out last year it was praised as being one of the only films to show that the soldiers were just as human as your or I. Obviously these people didn't see Heaven and Earth because this film bases itself almost entirely on showcasing the life and struggle of a war victim. The only difference here is that it is the life of the enemy. Can anyone honestly say that while watching a war film they think of how whenever an enemy is killed it is someone's son or brother dying or, how the war is effecting the innocent ones? I can say that I haven't and this film has helped me see Vietnam through an all new set of eyes. That is why Stone is such a great director, even though he fought and killed these people he still finds it in his heart to show both sides of the story. This film often gets mixed reviews and I guess that is because it is being compared to Platoon, but to say that one is better than the other would be missing the point. Although they are entirely separate films they all function as one entity and must all be seen in order to see Stone's vision, and a hell of a vision it is, these are three of the most realistic and horrifying war films to date. This is the true story of a young, Vietnamese girl named Le Ly who lives in a small village that is being ravaged by war. The inhabitants spend most of their day peacefully growing rice because it is their only food source. We worked like slaves and all we wanted was a bowel of rice and another day alive says Le Ly's father, a line that is important towards the second half of the film. She is then taken away and tortured for information. These torture scenes are brutal ad were particularly hard to watch due to their brutal realism. She is then released on a bribe from her parents that has the whole town questioning their ties with the government. She is the taken away by the Viet Cong and raped because they suspected she gave away information. Her and her mother then move to the city to become servants but are soon asked to leave after Le Ly gets pregnant with her masters son. She then meets Steve; a solider that she thinks just wants sex before he goes home. It turns out Steve is a nice guy. The two get married and go back to Chicago to live in America. Suddenly she sees that America is not what it is cracked up to be. Even though she now has more she was at least happy at home in Vietnam. Now she finds herself seeing tables of food wasted and is living with a family of plastic people who are following the American dream. The film actually functions as two separate works. The best being the first half that is possibly the saddest and most heart-wrenching depiction of a war stricken human being these eyes have ever seen, it truly is powerful stuff. When Le Ly and Steve move to American it stops being a war film and Stone gets a little carried away. He chooses an other-the-top style of direction to show every American as shallow pigs who are blinded by all their material possessions and look down upon the relationship. They don't understand, but I do. Says Steve. But Stone is smart in how he shows that even though America has much more than Vietnam that doesn't mean it is better. In Vietnam you had to work together and function as a team in order to achieve anything. Everyone loved each other and the people were happy with that. In America it is either push or be pushed, there is no sympathy for anyone. Although this was a smart way to contrast the war, after an hour and a half of watching the horror of Vietnam I felt a little obscure when then film suddenly changed from a war picture. Especially when just coming out of hardships that are enough to twist anyone's heart into knots. This then levels off and we are left with a study of bigotry and how one mans possessions can corrupt his mind and blind his eyes. Stone shows us that although war can leave a life torn and mangled, the people who came out of it are not cold and alone. These people are human beings as well. I don't think people realise this because in most war films we don't see the face of the enemy, they are just nobodies who have set out to be killed. This film helps us realise that they can love, they can hurt, they can feel and the can bleed just like the rest of us. Stone has not just placed a solider and a Vietnamese girl together and sees what happens. He has placed a human and a human together to see how they adapt and grow as one and as separate parties. We see how certain things react with certain emotions and how certain feelings are flared in different situations. Le Ly is not some character that has been made up; she was a real life human being who went through real life struggle. She was a human who lived in a human world. Stone does a fabulous job at showing that Le Ly was a human and he gets us so deep inside of her we can't help but feel for her. Stone filmed on location and the scenery is beautiful. Stone soars his camera across the stunning green plains, through the swaying rice fields, atop the tree and up into the shimmering blue sky. His use of scenery also helps to feel the tragedy when all the beauty is swept away and the horror of war begins. Stone also wrote the screenplay which he based on the two memoirs written by the real life Le Ly. Again he does an amazing job if showing the horrors of war, but this time without using mounds of violence. He also does a great job of contrasting the life in Vietnam as compared to that in America by making them seem like almost separate worlds. I also love the dialogue in this film. It is touching, heart-breaking and empowering all at the same time and that is rare in war films. The acting is also superb from Hiep Thi Le as Le Ly. This girl can show all of her inner torture yet innocence just through her eyes. Tommy Lee Jones is also good as her partner yet enemy Steve. Both of the actors show their humanity on their faces and their struggle in their eyes and easily change emotion from environment to environment, even from minute to minute. Because Stone can make a film like this, showing and saying what many would be afraid to, he truly is one of the greatest directors of our time (only being matched by David Lynch). It is nice to see that someone cares enough to show us that even though they were our enemy, the people of Vietnam were just as effected by this war as anyone in America and that they people just like us. Even though the two films following Platoon didn't reach the success or praise of the first film, Stone has made has made a great American trilogy. Three war films that have just as much to say as they do to show and it would be a tragedy to pass any of them up. Whether you are interested in Vietnam or just want a war film with something more than endless violence, this one is worth checking out.

Stone shows us that although war can leave a life torn and mangled, the people who came out of it are not cold and alone. These people are human beings as well. I don't think people realise this because in most war films we don't see the face of the enemy, they are just nobodies who have set out to be killed. This film helps us realise that they can love, they can hurt, they can feel and the can bleed just like the rest of us. Stone has not just placed a solider and a Vietnamese girl together and sees what happens. He has placed a human and a human together to see how they adapt and grow as one and as separate parties. We see how certain things react with certain emotions and how certain feelings are flared in different situations. Le Ly is not some character that has been made up; she was a real life human being who went through real life struggle. She was a human who lived in a human world. Stone does a fabulous job at showing that Le Ly was a human and he gets us so deep inside of her we can't help but feel for her. Stone filmed on location and the scenery is beautiful. Stone soars his camera across the stunning green plains, through the swaying rice fields, atop the tree and up into the shimmering blue sky. His use of scenery also helps to feel the tragedy when all the beauty is swept away and the horror of war begins. Stone also wrote the screenplay which he based on the two memoirs written by the real life Le Ly. Again he does an amazing job if showing the horrors of war, but this time without using mounds of violence. He also does a great job of contrasting the life in Vietnam as compared to that in America by making them seem like almost separate worlds. I also love the dialogue in this film. It is touching, heart-breaking and empowering all at the same time and that is rare in war films. The acting is also superb from Hiep Thi Le as Le Ly. This girl can show all of her inner torture yet innocence just through her eyes. Tommy Lee Jones is also good as her partner yet enemy Steve. Both of the actors show their humanity on their faces and their struggle in their eyes and easily change emotion from environment to environment, even from minute to minute. Because Stone can make a film like this, showing and saying what many would be afraid to, he truly is one of the greatest directors of our time (only being matched by David Lynch). It is nice to see that someone cares enough to show us that even though they were our enemy, the people of Vietnam were just as effected by this war as anyone in America and that they people just like us. Even though the two films following Platoon didn't reach the success or praise of the first film, Stone has made has made a great American trilogy. Three war films that have just as much to say as they do to show and it would be a tragedy to pass any of them up. Whether you are interested in Vietnam or just want a war film with something more than endless violence, this one is worth checking out.

Not only are you treated to a film good for the kids, but there are also many moments that will thrill adults. The movie is filled with emotion, action and incredible excitement.The movie opens with long introductions about Superman's past and his time growing up on Earth. We are treated wish such scenes as his launch into space, his naked discovery on Earth and his calling to go north. All of this fills pretty much the first hour of the film but we are never once bored.Once the action moves to Metropolis, it is almost like a whole new movie. The interaction between Lois and Clark is simply priceless. Their early scenes together build on what is to come, even moving into Superman II. Margo Kidder was perfect for this role. She just had the right look for Lois attractive without being a Super Model. It was just so sweet how Superman took to her. We are also introduced to Lex Luthor and his gang. Gene Hackman was perfect for this role and he really steals ever scene that he is in. The thing about Superman is that it has an epic feel to it and it never looks back. From the launch of baby Superman to the climatic ending sequences, we are drawn into the story. The witty dialogue is also one of the best aspects of the film. Whether it is the nonchalant comments from Superman (i.e. Bad Vibrations) to the famous, clap inducing You've Got Me? Who's got you? you never feel that any of the film is scripted. And the special effects, while dated (the miniatures LOOK miniature), are also extremely good. The DVD version is an absolute joy. You get 9 minutes of new footage, including more scenes in the Fortress of Solitude with Marlon Brando. There are several behind the scenes looks and several trailers and cast bios. The enhanced sound is also very impressive. When the credits at the beginning started to appear and then fly by, I was just taken back! I wasn't expecting it at all and it was a taste of things to come. You can even hear shards of kryptonite flying through space after Krypton explodes.Superman The Movie is one of the best comic book movies in the same tradition of greats like Dick Tracy and The Shadow. If you or your kids have never seen it, this is a must have. If you have, relive the magic again.

Believe me I enjoy battle scenes as much as the next film buff.  The invasion of Normandy in Saving Private Ryan took my breath away.  But when it just carries on to make up the bulk of the film as this does there is no way someone can follow a story because there is no story line to follow.  There is a guy that gets captured and that went no where.  There are people just running and shooting a the Somalians with loud gun fire covering over any possible dialogue making none of the characters worth remembering.  It basically has the plot and thematic equivalent of a Steven Segal movie and that is far from a complement.Many people talk about how realistic it is, but film making is not realism, it is supposed to be heightened realism, and you should be left with something more than just an visual memory of a guy holding a wound shut as blood spills on the floor.
