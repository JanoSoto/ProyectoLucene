The production quality was great, the acting was very absorbing, and a lot of the dialogue was quite funny.  A wonderful casting job.I really enjoyed seeing Gillian Anderson giving some life and expression to her character.  Maybe it's just that I'm so used to the fairly wooden FBI agent she portrays on The X-Files, but I was quite pleasantly surprised by her performance in what must have been a challenging role.Congratulations to Angelina Jolie for keeping her clothes on and allowing us to focus on her acting, since it's the best part of the film.  I absolutely loved the scenes where she quits drinking and when she hangs up the phone. Her reactions are such a pleasure to watch!Ryan Phillippe was a great counterpoint for Jolie's up-tempo character.  I don't think it would have hurt the film one bit if he had been sharing needles with his girlfriend.  I didn't like his character being portrayed as a complete victim.  His focus on sobriety would have made more sense too.Jon Stewart is still struggling to define himself as an actor\/comedian\/whatever.  He's talented and funny, I wish he'd stop trying so hard.Dennis Quaid did a good job, but he might as well have been in an entirely different film for all the relevance it had to the plot.  Anthony Edwards and Madeleine Stowe were utterly useless; that whole story line should have been dropped.Connery, Rowlands and Burstyn provided the solid performances one might expect from that lot.  It's two bad Carroll couldn't have cut those last two storylines and allowed them to provide a solid foundation to build up the Jolie\/Phillippe and Stewart\/Anderson relationships.The scenes with a mother bonding with her dying son were moving, but does it always have to be AIDS?  Gay people get cancer too.  And sometimes even people who aren't gay have trouble connecting with their parents.Even though I disliked Short Cuts because the content was so vile, I do respect it on the basis of artistic expression alone.  I don't know how Carroll thought he was going to pull off so many storylines converging into such a tidy ending without seeming to pale in comparison.And I know that this is trivial, but could Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands possibly have had three white kids that looked less like they are related than those three women?  Phillippe would have been much more believable as their grandson than Jolie was as their daughter.Ok, it could have been better in a lot of ways.  But they really did accomplish a lot.  First, it was upbeat without a sugary Hollywood ex machina ending--no small feat.  It was emotionally moving without making you feel too used, unlike the work of some other directors (paging Mr. Spielberg?).

I urge you to go. Just prepare yourself by clicking your heels together three times, and chant It's not Saving Private Ryan.. It's not Saving Private Ryan.. It's not Saving Private Ryan...  If you walk in knowing that any battle scenes will be few and far between, that this is much more of an internal movie than external, and that you will be forced to see the world from a higher viewpoint.. you'll do just fine.No.. there is no real plot to this movie.  But you have to remember.. for the men who fought in the war, many felt it would go on forever.  Yes... there were objectives, but every Joe knew that there wouldn't be a climatic ending like in the cliffhangers.  You get your job done, and you move on, finding some way to survive and while attempting to keep some meaning in your life.  Whether you do that by thinking of your girl, pondering over the nature of mankind, or going insane... everyone copes in a different way. Malick understands his objective and hits it right on the head, giving us an emotionally wrenching glance into the minds of various soldiers in different roles at Guadalcanal.I almost am in disbelief at those who say this movie isn't realistic. Granted, there are only a handful of dismembered corpses, but one doesn't need naked violence to prove realism.  Sure, Saving Private Ryan (the new benchmark for battle realism) showed us the brutal physical side of war to disquiet our stomachs for conflict (and isn't that the point of that film? To frighten us from letting it happen again?).  But it never gets close to the raw (and ultimately more damaging) psychological and philosophical consequences of war, where we suddenly realize our capacity for destruction, cruelty, egotism, and remorse over our actions.Saving Private Ryan is a trip through lands we've seen and traveled through before, just in more vivid, visceral detail Europe, damaged buildings, war, and heroics\/patriotism (Spielberg may like to think the latter are muted in his movie, in an vain attempt to be more cynical about war... but he's kidding himself).  The Thin Red Line takes us into a different world a pristine land of innocence cut by a swath of violence, where every man is equal in the cool eyes of nature, and it is up to each individual to find their own salvation, or lack thereof.While Saving Private Ryan is about our blood (both literally and figuratively), The Thin Red Line looks through into our souls.

By the titles, however, it was pretty much full, as people found their options limited by an increasing number of sold-out screens.The film itself started at a reasonable pace, although there were far too many meaningful pauses and conversations, and Cameron Diaz was over-acting to the point of me just wanting to grab her and give her a shake to try and calm her down.Then they got to Vegas, and any semblance of affinity that I may have felt for the group fell away as they were seen taking line after line of cocaine in their room - by the time they got round to killing Tina, I could not have cared less what happened to them.There is little that I can say about the gruesome nature of the film from this point on that has not already been said, but suffice it to say that I have not walked out of a film in three years, but resolved to do so after the security guard was despatched.  However, to add insult to injury, I dropped my car keys as I was standing up and could not find them in the dark and was forced to remain until the end.To give the film credit, there was some very strong acting as the quintet was diminished and fell into psychological disarray, but it was bound together by the most grizzly sequences I have ever seen, and one of my favourite films is Starship Troopers.  It all smacked of a director without the courage of his convictions to create the shock through suggestion and implication as would have been done by so many others.  This was film direction at its most two dimensional and immature.However, it was perhaps something entirely out with the production teams control that disturbed me the most, and that was the reaction throughout of a Glasgow audience fueled by beer before they came in, and perhaps desiring a comedy but finding it sold out, so choosing another film that they would be determined to find funny irrespective of the subject matter.  I was constantly bemused by people laughing at genuinely shocking imagery, particularly at the end.  The sight of someone spinning in a wheelchair with a feed tube in his mouth does not make me laugh.

Number one, to William Goldman I'm not saying this because I'm supporting or defending Clinton (which I'm NOT), but do please stop writing political thrillers.  Number two, to Ed Harris well, at least it was better than Stepmom.Number three actually would have gone to Clint Eastwood please stop starring, producing, and directing your own movies but he obviously got the point as nary a frame of the intriguing Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil shows him.That said, let's go on to my review of Absolute Power, which is twenty notches above Murder at 1600, which I saw being filmed, but a hundred notches below Six Days in May, In the Line of Fire, or about any other political thriller you can name.Absolute Power is pleasantly medicore.  You don't expect much, and you don't get much.It is yet another film following the Clinton chic of films, books, etc which show our nations President as someone who's able to get laid, in constrast to someone who couldn't get it up without Viagra. Absolute Power is the story of a President who has sex with a girl and, whoops, ends up killing her. Unlike Murder at 1600, which shows the girl being done right in the opening credits, Absolute Power waits a nice ten to fifteen minutes before getting down to business.When it gets down to business, Luther (Clint Eastwood ) is breaking into an estate to steal millions.  His perfect heist is interrupted by something unplanned the president is going to have sex with the billionaires wife. Things get a little rough, one thing leads to another, and the girl ends up shot by secret service agents seconds before she's going to give President Al (Gene Hackman) a Lorraina Bobbit.Of course, since we live in the wonderful democracy where everyone is free to make a dumbly plotted and cliche film as they want, the Chief of Staff decides its for the best if the girl stumbled upon a burglary and was shot. Forget for a second that her dress has been ripped, the President's fingerprints are all over her, and a secret service agent (Scott Glenn) made sure he hadn't done a Bill Clinton.Now, going out of the character of a jewel thief who just witnessed a murder from a secret room and stole $5,000,000 worth of material, Clint grows a heart, picks up the piece of evidence left behind, and leaves.  Of course secret service agents chase him.  Of course he runs into a cop (Ed Harris) who believes him because the facts don't add up, and of course his daughter (Laura Linney) grows closer to the old man through a complicated process of stocking her fridge at just the right time and saving her life.The only really redeeming aspects to the film, the saving graces against terrible performances by the ensemble cast and William Goldman's piss-poor script is the steely direction by Clint Eastwood.  Mixing in just the right amount of light, the right tone and time of the music and working with such a terrible script, Clint Eastwood does directing up to par with A Perfect World and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  He's as good of a director as he always was, and that alone makes the film enjoyable.  He gives as much that he can to a movie with such a bad script, as do the actors.  This will be on the movie's gravestone They tried, they really tried.Now, from all of this, you'd expect that I'm telling you to skip Absolute Power.  I'm not.  I'm just saying don't drive to rent it.  Should Absolute Power be on TMC or Showtime, like it was for me, go ahead and watch it. You'll have fun.

For several months I'd been intrigued by a silver-gray movie poster at the Memphian Theater back home that said simply, Coming to Your Galaxy This Summer Star Wars. My feet were tired from walking all over New York, so I decided, What the heck, and got in line. When I bought my ticket I was given a pin-on button, about three inches in diameter, upon which was printed against a blue field of stars, May the Force Be With You. Wonder what that means? I thought, and I pinned it on my shirt. I found a seat and for the next two hours, as I sat suspended in space from the front row of the balcony, Star Wars transported me, as no movie had before, to adventures in a time and place I could never have imagined. Star Wars took my breath away. Almost literally. When the Millennium Falcon kicked into overdrive and the stars stretched, I nearly fell out of the balcony. The next day I traveled home and told all my friends that they would soon see a new science fiction movie that was about to sweep the country and they would all love it. They thought I was nuts, but I was mostly right of course. (Can you believe some people don't love Star Wars?) Now I have the new version of all three Star Wars films on LaserDisc, and I expect to continue enjoying them for years to come. And yes, I like the new versions better.

For several months I'd been intrigued by a silver-gray movie poster at the Memphian Theater back home that said simply, Coming to Your Galaxy This Summer Star Wars. My feet were tired from walking all over New York, so I decided, What the heck, and got in line. When I bought my ticket I was given a pin-on button, about three inches in diameter, upon which was printed against a blue field of stars, May the Force Be With You. Wonder what that means? I thought, and I pinned it on my shirt. I found a seat and for the next two hours, as I sat suspended in space from the front row of the balcony, Star Wars transported me, as no movie had before, to adventures in a time and place I could never have imagined. Star Wars took my breath away. Almost literally. When the Millennium Falcon kicked into overdrive and the stars stretched, I nearly fell out of the balcony. The next day I traveled home and told all my friends that they would soon see a new science fiction movie that was about to sweep the country and they would all love it. They thought I was nuts, but I was mostly right of course. (Can you believe some people don't love Star Wars?) Now I have the new version of all three Star Wars films on LaserDisc, and I expect to continue enjoying them for years to come. And yes, I like the new versions better.

Showy as his role undeniably is, he never pushes it too far.

She can speak volumes with her thickly-shadowed black eyes and an omnipresent cigarette. We never get the full story on her relationship with her late husband, LV's beloved father, but the tension and the words unsaid are brought to a boil in a key scene between Blethyn and Horrocks.Come Oscar time, it would be wonderful to see Little Voice get some recognition.

Although one very good piece of music is thrown away on the Earps arrival\/departure vis Tombstone, Wyatts theme develops slowly as the luckless man is drawn inevitably toward the very destiny he fears and despises.  Finally, the theme blares forth in all its tragic splendour as a now lonely figure of Wyatt Earp stands alone in the midst of the carnage of the OK Corral, outlined against a western sky where even the clouds draw attention to him. Great! The relationship between the two killers Holliday and Ringo is excellent, with a slightly unsettled Ringo trying to handle the fact that he is being stalked Let's play for blood!. If more westerns had been like this the genre would not be unpopular today. ","genre":"Action, Biography, Drama"}]
