It's a hypocritical, pompous mess which has been idolised by the youth for its over-the-top violence and over-the-top language and hailed by others for its heard-it-all-before message.After juvenile delinquent Alex (The admittedly excellent Malcolm McDowell) kills one person too many (with a statue of a penis with the other woman swinging a bust of his favourite composer Beethoven at him, oh the deliciously subtle irony of it all), he gets carted off to jail, snags himself the Ludovico treatment and is made to feel disgust every time he tries to act out on his violent and sexual urges.Speaking of the violence, the majority occurs in the opening half an hour, and it would be shocking if it weren't for Kubrick's gimmicky treatment of it to add a cheaply ironic edge to it all. It just reduces the violence to a cartoon, all to smash us over the head with the fact that there's too much violence in society and we're as much to blame as the criminals for this. In effect, Kubrick has designed the film as a Ludovico treatment for the audience, but he made a complete mess of proceedings with the purposely hilarious violence If you want to make a serious point about a serious issue, sometimes you have to put it in a serious context.But it's not just the violence that is overused, Alex's voice-over simply takes away from Kubrick's storytelling abilities, ramming home every point that doesn't need to be spelt out for the audience, all until the pathetic final line of the film that's meant to be ironic but just comes across as incredibly cheesy. The worst aspect of the film? The horribly outdated synthesised soundtrack which adds another ironic tone to the violence, unnecessary, overused and just plain terrible. It all adds up to a pointless film that teaches us that violence is wrong, politicians will do anything to stay in power, prison can't always reform criminals and the youth are crazy, why tell us something we don't know already. It's not even the fact that Kubrick tries to let us come to our own decision, by purposely trying to make us laugh at the violence and then judging us for laughing at it, it's just hypocritical, forceful and downright pompous. You can't chase somebody down in your car, run them over then berate them for getting hit.Overall A Clockwork Orange is a big mistake from a director who has thankfully made far better films with more subtlety and more trust in the audience. For films about the violence in society, I recommend Badlands which is better in literally every single way.

The original House probably never made anyone's list of top horror movies, but it's entertaining in its own, modest way. I can't say the same for House II. Nor can I honestly say it's a sequel. It doesn't feature any of the characters from the original. It's also a completely different house. The house in House was built on a weak spot between our world and the world of the dead, while the house in House II was built at the crossroads of time and space. This is, I believe, an important distinction. There doesn't seem to be any reason for calling this House II, except to justify the clever subtitle.But that's not the only problem. The filmmakers clearly didn't know what kind of film they wanted to make, and the result is a jumbled mess. It starts off promising, and is shaping up to be a good haunted-house horror film when it suddenly and inexplicably becomes a fantasy-adventure comedy, during which time the ghost that the movie once seemed to be centered around is never seen and hardly mentioned. Then, after the viewer has adjusted to the new premise, the ghost comes back, and none of the threads brought up during the middle part are properly resolved. It's all pushed aside for a dramatic dénouement, followed by a final scene that raises further questions rather than answering any of the many existing ones.I should also add that this movie contains several insults to the viewer's intelligence, which I wouldn't excuse even if it were an out-and-out comedy. In one scene, our hero falls hundreds of feet, but falls into a portal that lets him out right above the floor in his own house. The problem is that his momentum shouldn't change, so he should still be dead. In another scene, a zombie is strangled until he loses consciousness. Just think about that one for a moment.So why did I give this an average review? Because there are good points. It's original, for starters. It may be hugely disjointed with little internal logic, but at least it isn't just retreading old clichés. It features characters who you care about, because they're fairly believable and interesting. It boasts special effects that are well above par for 1987, and some visually intriguing scenes and designs. The humor, as misplaced as it may be at times, is often quite funny.

The part with him is just great, not just because of his performance, but the way his character is written, and the sequence's juxtaposition of the banal and the otherworldly.

Tim Roth also offers an unforgettable performance as Mr. Orange - an incredibly deep character whose story is the most interesting out of all the others.

Before you get too excited, I should point out that in 1962 the Production Code was still in force, any striptease shown in the film is very tame and watered down and anyone hoping for anything racier than the sight of Natalie Wood in a bikini will be in for a disappointment.Indeed, for much of its length Gypsy is not about striptease at all and its ostensible heroine, the future Gypsy Rose Lee, is not the principal character. Contrary to what I once thought, Gypsy Rose was not an ethnic Romany. Her real name was Louise Hovick and she was originally from Seattle. The main character in the early scenes is her mother Rose, played here as the stage mother from Hell. Rose Hovick drags her two daughters around the country in an effort to turn them into vaudeville stars. (The film is set in the 1920s and 1930s, a time when vaudeville was going into decline because of the growth in popularity of the cinema). The star of the family act is not Louise, who displays little talent for show business, but her younger and more talented sister June.At first the act, Baby June and Her Newsboys, enjoys some success, but eventually June, by now a teenager, rebels against her domineering mother and elopes with one of her backing dancers. (One might have thought that a childhood like this would have put June off showbiz for life, but in reality June Hovick went on to become a successful screen and stage actress under the name June Havoc. Her subsequent career, however, is not mentioned in the film). Rose then turns her attentions to Louise, who seems an inadequate replacement for her sister. Louise, however, gets an unexpected break as a performer in a burlesque show- much to Rose's disgust, as she has always regarded striptease as immoral.(I should perhaps point out that this film well exemplifies the dictum that Britain and America are two countries divided by common language. In Britain the word burlesque, in the theatre or anywhere else, means a satire or parody. It does not have any connotations of striptease. There is no such word as vaudeville in British English, similar entertainments being known here as music hall or variety theatre).I am not familiar with the work of Ethel Merman- I have never seen any of her films except Airplane! and certainly never saw her on stage. (She died when I was in my early twenties). I am therefore unable, unlike some of the other contributors to this board, to join in the debate as to whether she or Rosalind Russell should have been cast as Rose. (Merman had created the role on stage, but Russell got the part in the film for reasons connected with cinema and theatre politics). I have to say, however, that I thought Russell was very good in the role, at least as far as her acting is concerned. Her singing is another matter. Her rather gravelly singing voice was dubbed in some songs but not in others, and the overall result is far from satisfactory.Indeed, the acting in Gypsy impressed me more than did the singing or the music. Russell, whatever her shortcomings as a singer may have been, makes Rose an entertaining sacred monster, the sort of woman whose antics might be fun to watch on the screen but who in real life must have been virtually impossible for her daughters to live with. She receives good support from Karl Malden as Rose's long-suffering boyfriend Herbie and from Wood as the naive, sensitive young Louise. Wood, incidentally, was allowed to sing her own songs in Gypsy, even though her singing voice had been dubbed the previous year in West Side Story. Producers were not always consistent about such things; Audrey Hepburn, for example, did her own singing in Funny Face and Breakfast at Tiffany's but not My Fair Lady. Perhaps the makers of Gypsy allowed Wood to sing because audiences might not have accepted that Louise lacks talent as a singer or dancer- a key plot point- had she been voiced by someone like Marni Nixon.As a musical, Gypsy is not a great one. Although Stephen Sondheim's lyrics are often effective, few of the songs really stick in the memory, except perhaps for Everything's Coming Up Roses and Let Me Entertain You. You Gotta Have A Gimmick is memorable not for the music but for the antics of the three strippers who perform it. As a character-driven drama and a portrayal of showbiz life, however, it is a very good one. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 January 2010","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Gypsy is a musical based on the memoirs of a notorious stripper.

There is no such word as vaudeville in British English, similar entertainments being known here as music hall or variety theatre).I am not familiar with the work of Ethel Merman- I have never seen any of her films except Airplane! and certainly never saw her on stage.

I have to say, however, that I thought Russell was very good in the role, at least as far as her acting is concerned. Her singing is another matter. Her rather gravelly singing voice was dubbed in some songs but not in others, and the overall result is far from satisfactory.Indeed, the acting in Gypsy impressed me more than did the singing or the music. Russell, whatever her shortcomings as a singer may have been, makes Rose an entertaining sacred monster, the sort of woman whose antics might be fun to watch on the screen but who in real life must have been virtually impossible for her daughters to live with. She receives good support from Karl Malden as Rose's long-suffering boyfriend Herbie and from Wood as the naive, sensitive young Louise. Wood, incidentally, was allowed to sing her own songs in Gypsy, even though her singing voice had been dubbed the previous year in West Side Story. Producers were not always consistent about such things; Audrey Hepburn, for example, did her own singing in Funny Face and Breakfast at Tiffany's but not My Fair Lady.

Before you get too excited, I should point out that in 1962 the Production Code was still in force, any striptease shown in the film is very tame and watered down and anyone hoping for anything racier than the sight of Natalie Wood in a bikini will be in for a disappointment.Indeed, for much of its length Gypsy is not about striptease at all and its ostensible heroine, the future Gypsy Rose Lee, is not the principal character. Contrary to what I once thought, Gypsy Rose was not an ethnic Romany. Her real name was Louise Hovick and she was originally from Seattle. The main character in the early scenes is her mother Rose, played here as the stage mother from Hell. Rose Hovick drags her two daughters around the country in an effort to turn them into vaudeville stars. (The film is set in the 1920s and 1930s, a time when vaudeville was going into decline because of the growth in popularity of the cinema). The star of the family act is not Louise, who displays little talent for show business, but her younger and more talented sister June.At first the act, Baby June and Her Newsboys, enjoys some success, but eventually June, by now a teenager, rebels against her domineering mother and elopes with one of her backing dancers. (One might have thought that a childhood like this would have put June off showbiz for life, but in reality June Hovick went on to become a successful screen and stage actress under the name June Havoc. Her subsequent career, however, is not mentioned in the film). Rose then turns her attentions to Louise, who seems an inadequate replacement for her sister. Louise, however, gets an unexpected break as a performer in a burlesque show- much to Rose's disgust, as she has always regarded striptease as immoral.(I should perhaps point out that this film well exemplifies the dictum that Britain and America are two countries divided by common language.

The Wizard of Oz, the classic 1939 movie, attempts to bring a modern-day, American-made mythology to life. And there's no doubt it succeeded.

First off, I'll note Oz has great colour- better colour than some movies made decades later.

Sadly though, this film is regarded as one of the lesser entries in the series today and in my opinion this is unrightfully so, because I regard this as the best Star Trek film and a great film in general.Let me start with a short plot outline. We first witness the approach of a giant cloud, which will be the main character. From there on, we move to the crew of the refitted Enterprise. We see how Admiral Kirk takes command of the Enterprise from Captain Decker (Stephen Collins) and how Spock joins the crew later on, after having rejected pure logic as the way of life. There's also a new bridge officer onboard Lt. Ilia (Khambatta). The ship's crew is now complete and together they're about to intercept the mysterious cloud which they must stop before it reaches Earth. A journey of understanding begins, because for the crew to stop the entity, it's necessary to uncover its motivations. They learn parts from Ilia, who has been taken by the invader and has returned in the form of a probe to observe the crew and she tells them that V'Ger (the invader) wishes to speak with The Creator. Spock also plays a role in uncovering more of the mystery, as he takes a space suit and journeys to the inner chambers of V'Ger, where he mindmelds with it and learns a great deal about how it thinks. In the end, the crew finds out who The Creator is and an explanation to V'Ger's behavior.The film is very slow moving, but that's part of what makes this film as great as it is. The film takes a philosophical approach to Star Trek, making a slow furthering of the plot appropriate, since it gives you time to reflect on the information you're given. Besides the philosophical aspect, the film dares to take time for showing us how beautiful and elegant space travel actually is. Call it an epic approach, which already becomes apparent by means of an overture. Furthermore, it features a six minute scene in which Admiral Kirk and Scotty take a tour around the refitted Enterprise. The model is truly breathtaking, as is the set design. The bridge looks like it could really be used in a space ship and Engineering never looked better. The film features more extensive modeling work, which is all extremely well-crafted. Once we have reached the outskirts of the cloud, we journey to its center, to where the actual entity is located and this costs us about fifteen minutes. Once again we see great special effects, as we first move through the cloud, followed by the fly-over of an enormous space ship. We then move inside, to reveal an even more astounding interior. These scenes could have been done in two minutes, but luckily the film takes the epic approach and shows us all. Through this approach we really feel the mystery of space and the threat the invader poses. This approach calls for a good musical score and Jerry Goldsmith more than delivers that, he actually delivers an almost divine score. It matches the film exactly and it enhances the film greatly, taking it to another level. The score embodies the romance in Ilia's Theme, the excitement in the Main Title, the elegance in the Starfleet music (especially in The Enterprise) and the mystery and danger in the V'Ger cues, which sound really otherworldly thanks to the use of the 'Blaster Beam'. Never before have I heard a score which melts as perfectly with what's on screen as this one.I already mentioned the philosophical approach which is at the heart of the film. To me, this film embodies what Star Trek is about. It's about humanity in the broadest way; it's about what humans have to offer, about what makes us a good species. In the end, it's perhaps hopelessly optimistic about humanity, but the concept is brought in such a believable manner that you believe in it and it's a concept I want to believe in. That it's so believable has to do with the fact that it's science fiction, which gives the opportunity to put down an evolved human race, without the context of the present. Besides the human theme, the film also poses big questions, like why are we here, where do we come from? Such questions are seldom in a major motion picture, but they are worthy of exploration in a film.One last aspect acting. This is not one of the film's better aspects, but it's by no means bad acting. Opinions on William Shatner's acting talents differ, but I don't mind him. The other original crewmembers deliver good performances and Leonard Nimoy excels as Spock, in search for answers to life. Persis Khambatta looks gorgeous as the bald Ilia and delivers a nice performance. My only quibble is the subplot about the tension between Kirk and Decker, which feels somewhat out of place in the overall film, but that's not the actors' fault, but that lies with the script.What makes this film so great is that it doesn't shy away from being a real science fiction film, in the Gene Roddenberry style. There are universal human values to be learned in the context of the future and space, without shying away from real science fiction and the exploration aspect. This film balances these aspects really well and thus becomes really involving and challenging. Combine this with great modeling and special effects work, a score which is divine and a lovely slow pacing and you've got a philosophical, exciting, adventurous and above all, a true Star Trek film.9\/10.

The bridge looks like it could really be used in a space ship and Engineering never looked better. The film features more extensive modeling work, which is all extremely well-crafted.

These scenes could have been done in two minutes, but luckily the film takes the epic approach and shows us all. Through this approach we really feel the mystery of space and the threat the invader poses. This approach calls for a good musical score and Jerry Goldsmith more than delivers that, he actually delivers an almost divine score. It matches the film exactly and it enhances the film greatly, taking it to another level. The score embodies the romance in Ilia's Theme, the excitement in the Main Title, the elegance in the Starfleet music (especially in The Enterprise) and the mystery and danger in the V'Ger cues, which sound really otherworldly thanks to the use of the 'Blaster Beam'. Never before have I heard a score which melts as perfectly with what's on screen as this one.I already mentioned the philosophical approach which is at the heart of the film. To me, this film embodies what Star Trek is about. It's about humanity in the broadest way; it's about what humans have to offer, about what makes us a good species. In the end, it's perhaps hopelessly optimistic about humanity, but the concept is brought in such a believable manner that you believe in it and it's a concept I want to believe in. That it's so believable has to do with the fact that it's science fiction, which gives the opportunity to put down an evolved human race, without the context of the present. Besides the human theme, the film also poses big questions, like why are we here, where do we come from? Such questions are seldom in a major motion picture, but they are worthy of exploration in a film.One last aspect acting. This is not one of the film's better aspects, but it's by no means bad acting. Opinions on William Shatner's acting talents differ, but I don't mind him. The other original crewmembers deliver good performances and Leonard Nimoy excels as Spock, in search for answers to life. Persis Khambatta looks gorgeous as the bald Ilia and delivers a nice performance. My only quibble is the subplot about the tension between Kirk and Decker, which feels somewhat out of place in the overall film, but that's not the actors' fault, but that lies with the script.What makes this film so great is that it doesn't shy away from being a real science fiction film, in the Gene Roddenberry style. There are universal human values to be learned in the context of the future and space, without shying away from real science fiction and the exploration aspect. This film balances these aspects really well and thus becomes really involving and challenging. Combine this with great modeling and special effects work, a score which is divine and a lovely slow pacing and you've got a philosophical, exciting, adventurous and above all, a true Star Trek film.9\/10.

Sadly though, this film is regarded as one of the lesser entries in the series today and in my opinion this is unrightfully so, because I regard this as the best Star Trek film and a great film in general.Let me start with a short plot outline. We first witness the approach of a giant cloud, which will be the main character. From there on, we move to the crew of the refitted Enterprise. We see how Admiral Kirk takes command of the Enterprise from Captain Decker (Stephen Collins) and how Spock joins the crew later on, after having rejected pure logic as the way of life. There's also a new bridge officer onboard Lt. Ilia (Khambatta). The ship's crew is now complete and together they're about to intercept the mysterious cloud which they must stop before it reaches Earth. A journey of understanding begins, because for the crew to stop the entity, it's necessary to uncover its motivations. They learn parts from Ilia, who has been taken by the invader and has returned in the form of a probe to observe the crew and she tells them that V'Ger (the invader) wishes to speak with The Creator. Spock also plays a role in uncovering more of the mystery, as he takes a space suit and journeys to the inner chambers of V'Ger, where he mindmelds with it and learns a great deal about how it thinks. In the end, the crew finds out who The Creator is and an explanation to V'Ger's behavior.The film is very slow moving, but that's part of what makes this film as great as it is. The film takes a philosophical approach to Star Trek, making a slow furthering of the plot appropriate, since it gives you time to reflect on the information you're given. Besides the philosophical aspect, the film dares to take time for showing us how beautiful and elegant space travel actually is. Call it an epic approach, which already becomes apparent by means of an overture. Furthermore, it features a six minute scene in which Admiral Kirk and Scotty take a tour around the refitted Enterprise. The model is truly breathtaking, as is the set design.

In simple terms this is not a film you can watch just the once - if you do you will feel confused and probably let down. Persevere, watch it again though and most likely you will start to get it...Because of this i think OUATIA could truly be a unique cinematic experience, something you really have to delve into and immerse yourself in otherwise you will not come to recognise and spot the nuances or the messages contained within. It's not so much a gangster flick in the obvious sense, more a story told of love lost and lives wasted, friendships forged and ultimately betrayed. Much has already been said about the cinematography, the score, the sets and the acting of which all are truly first class even allowing perhaps for my slight reservations on McGovern. The child actors for me are every bit as good as the seasoned pros and Jennifer Connelly is simply wonderful.The film has flaws absolutely, but what again makes this a unique experience is that those flaws (for me anyway) just add to the mystique of the film rather than take anything away. It's not mean't to be a historically correct story-telling anyway and the reviewer elsewhere who bemoaned the bridge not being the Brooklyn bridge or some such is so missing the point, as do the few who from their words you can tell have just not taken the time to really watch and involve themselves. Maybe some people will just never get it anyway...!To sum up this is a film for those who are prepared to give more of their time, thought and effort to it than just your normal 120 minute Hollywood banality ride demands. If you truly love cinema and have the patience to give it the attention it deserves you will i'm sure be richly rewarded.

The only difference is that Universal took the film rights, ending up producing all the sequels so far. The only returnees are scribes John Lafia (who has taken the director's chair) & Don Mancini, the producer & visual effects people, as well as stars Alex Vincent & Brad Dourif.The Play Pals toy factory has obtained the burnt remains of Chucky & sets out to discover the fault by rebuilding it. Returning to life, Chucky tries to track down Andy Barclay who, following his mother's committal to an asylum, has been sent to live with foster parents Phil & Joanne Simpson. Things don't go according to plan, with the doll resorting to murder in order to get to Andy.To be quite frank, I didn't really like the original film. It was, as some critics have pointed out, extremely silly. The concept had a limited idea &#x96; that of a killer doll doing a Freddy Krueger - & was full of ridiculous plot twists (the idea that a person could transfer their soul into a doll is bad enough, but having its body turning human & only being able to transfer again into the first person to uncover its secret is just plain ludicrous). I first saw this sequel when I was a child & it unnerved me. Watching it today, I ended up laughing.While it is stuck with the same stupid plot as the original, Child's Play 2 is actually better, mainly due to Lafia making some scenes truly suspenseful. There's a scene where Alex Vincent hunts Chucky in the dark basement, which has a commendable tension, as well as the teenage girl cornering it in the bedroom. Don Mancini's script is a lot better than his previous work, but still has some dead spots, making the Child's Play series the filmic equivalent of an M60 machine gun &#x96; in the sense that both the films & the weapon started out as very poor designs & have now reached a high standard of mediocrity.The other thing about the film is Chucky himself, killing people while spouting one-liners. The doll effects are better this time around, with the doll's features looking more human than doll. The climax, where Chucky is slowly destroyed piece-by-piece (first he loses his hand, then his lower half, then is covered with molten plastic & finally blown up with an air pump) is similar to the climax of THE TERMINATOR, although not as good as that film ever was.One of the script's strengths is that it conducts things in a more believable manner than the first film. The doll is rebuilt in the toy factory (although I don't think that, after the technicians completely build the doll from a burnt skull, they should use a machine to insert the eyes &#x96; can't they do it themselves?) in order to unearth the reason it turned deadly, while Catherine Hicks is sent to the loony bin because she backed up her son's story in court.On the acting front, Jenny Agutter (fans of war films will recognize her from THE EAGLE HAS LANDED) & Gerrit Graham do a good job as the foster parents, while Brad Dourif delivers another good performance as the wisecracking Chucky.

","genre":"Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"12 January 2010","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Stallone and director Stephen T. Kay's re-imaging of the stunning, 1971 British gangster film Get Carter is a monumental mess on mostly all levels; a wavering, distorted and frankly quite annoying piece that renders what was once scuzzy pulp into polished actioner and slow burning film-noir into loud, messy, flashy nonsense. Some will claim it is Kay implementing his own style onto a set text, but in this case it is a set text that did not need re-imagining combined with a style we don't want to see, while the original did not need an update and certainly doesn't need to be fiddled with in order to act as a directorial calling card for someone who would later go onto have a career in making television shows.The 2000 remake of Get Carter begins in its immediacy of establishing some sort of passing of the guard; this by way of briefly playing the old theme tune from the original film over the images before a newer, more contemporary beat kicks in continuing the same basic tone; in a sort of style that sounds like it was spat out of a rave club and landed smack bang on the soundtrack. It's a telling moment; a moment in which the recognition of the old was there, and that this newer version of both the music and film brings everything up to speed for the sake of it. Sylvester Stallone is Jack Carter this time around, a heavy working in Las Vegas more-so London who boards a train in order to travel to Seattle more-so Newcastle in order to attend his brother's funeral. One would hope the distorted, fragmented manner in which Jack's train journey is put across by way of the angles and editing is representative of the character's distorted and wavering emotions as he gradually gets closer to home with the realisation of a sibling's death gradually kicking in, rather than be included for the fact it might, in the maker's eye, 'look cool'.Carter finds an unnatural manner in being able to waltz around kicking guys' heads in; bullying his way into confrontations with people and evading injury during car chases with more sombre, more down to Earth scenes with Doreen (Leigh Cook), his niece and his brother's daughter. The scenes with Doreen enable Carter to act as some sort of would-be fatherly figure as he attempts to take her under his wing; delivering advice as if it were his brother's own, about life and what to do with it and how keeping on the straight and narrow is important &#x96; it's a life lecture from an action lead who, on other occasions when speaking to other characters, tells them Sure it does when told that revenge doesn't work and it's implied that it ought to be something to be chased down.The film sees Carter visit a whole bunch of misfits, from Alan Cumming's techno-boffin Jeremy Kinnear to Mickey Rourke's porn king-come-businessman Cyrus Paice, an individual who distributes a lot of pornography akin to Caine's version, only because it's now 2000 and it's the 21st Century we've moved into here, everything is done by way of computers and disk drives instead of 8mm film stock. I say the 1971 film was Caine's version, but Michael Caine does actually have a role here, that of Cliff Brumby who you'll remember was tossed over the side of a multi storey car park in the old one by Caine himself. The joke around about the time of the release of this, I'm sure, must've been that Caine is playing the character he tossed away over the side in the original; while in playing a part in the ill-advised remake of Get Carter, thus has now tossed his own career over the side. Fortunatley, this didn't have the ill guided effect on his career it might've done.Snide jokes aside, the problem that the remake of Get Carter is a dunderheaded, bits and pieces revenge action thriller starring someone whom seems to gradually get less and less interested as the film progresses is just half the issue.

","genre":null},{"date":"12 January 2010","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Stallone and director Stephen T. Kay's re-imaging of the stunning, 1971 British gangster film Get Carter is a monumental mess on mostly all levels; a wavering, distorted and frankly quite annoying piece that renders what was once scuzzy pulp into polished actioner and slow burning film-noir into loud, messy, flashy nonsense. Some will claim it is Kay implementing his own style onto a set text, but in this case it is a set text that did not need re-imagining combined with a style we don't want to see, while the original did not need an update and certainly doesn't need to be fiddled with in order to act as a directorial calling card for someone who would later go onto have a career in making television shows.The 2000 remake of Get Carter begins in its immediacy of establishing some sort of passing of the guard; this by way of briefly playing the old theme tune from the original film over the images before a newer, more contemporary beat kicks in continuing the same basic tone; in a sort of style that sounds like it was spat out of a rave club and landed smack bang on the soundtrack. It's a telling moment; a moment in which the recognition of the old was there, and that this newer version of both the music and film brings everything up to speed for the sake of it. Sylvester Stallone is Jack Carter this time around, a heavy working in Las Vegas more-so London who boards a train in order to travel to Seattle more-so Newcastle in order to attend his brother's funeral. One would hope the distorted, fragmented manner in which Jack's train journey is put across by way of the angles and editing is representative of the character's distorted and wavering emotions as he gradually gets closer to home with the realisation of a sibling's death gradually kicking in, rather than be included for the fact it might, in the maker's eye, 'look cool'.Carter finds an unnatural manner in being able to waltz around kicking guys' heads in; bullying his way into confrontations with people and evading injury during car chases with more sombre, more down to Earth scenes with Doreen (Leigh Cook), his niece and his brother's daughter. The scenes with Doreen enable Carter to act as some sort of would-be fatherly figure as he attempts to take her under his wing; delivering advice as if it were his brother's own, about life and what to do with it and how keeping on the straight and narrow is important &#x96; it's a life lecture from an action lead who, on other occasions when speaking to other characters, tells them Sure it does when told that revenge doesn't work and it's implied that it ought to be something to be chased down.The film sees Carter visit a whole bunch of misfits, from Alan Cumming's techno-boffin Jeremy Kinnear to Mickey Rourke's porn king-come-businessman Cyrus Paice, an individual who distributes a lot of pornography akin to Caine's version, only because it's now 2000 and it's the 21st Century we've moved into here, everything is done by way of computers and disk drives instead of 8mm film stock. I say the 1971 film was Caine's version, but Michael Caine does actually have a role here, that of Cliff Brumby who you'll remember was tossed over the side of a multi storey car park in the old one by Caine himself. The joke around about the time of the release of this, I'm sure, must've been that Caine is playing the character he tossed away over the side in the original; while in playing a part in the ill-advised remake of Get Carter, thus has now tossed his own career over the side. Fortunatley, this didn't have the ill guided effect on his career it might've done.Snide jokes aside, the problem that the remake of Get Carter is a dunderheaded, bits and pieces revenge action thriller starring someone whom seems to gradually get less and less interested as the film progresses is just half the issue.

They are told of ghosts that roam the grounds of the manor, but shrug it off. They quickly realize the ghosts are there and apparently want to hurt them, but they have nowhere to go and decide to stay... The fun times follow.OK William Castle has had his moments, but he always tried to hard. His silly gimmicks were a waste of time and suckered people into the theatres, but often let them down. Now 50 years later, its dated bad and only has the cheesy factor keeping it alive.Everything about this movie is funny and great to laugh at. The acting was so bad in this film, but not by bad actors only by instruction from a silly director. The actors are great. Charles Herbert playing the kid was something Castle insisted on, he was in so many movies back then and was a big screen kid actor everyone knew. Martin Milner was so over the top funny in this, unintentionally of course, when his character was telling young Buck about keeping secrets the look on his face was priceless, I could not stop laughing. It was also a cute and wise choice to have Margaret Hamilton as the housekeeper here, they all called her a witch and she was the wicked witch on The Wizard Of Oz in 39.The funniest thing was how the family didn't believe in ghosts, but kept seeing them and acting nonchalant about it as if they still didn't believe. A real family would've gotten out the first night.Castle always tried so hard to make good horror movies, but he always had ideas he could not pull off on screen. You have to have suspense to make it scary and he just could not grasp that concept. Silly ghost images and loud noises only came off as dumb and nothing more. This movie although many consider 3-d was actually not, it was Illusion O which had both colors saw through the same eye as opposed to 3-d having one color per eye. This gimmick made the ghosts show up a little better in theatres but you can see the ghosts with the naked eye, although you won't care.I just think that a lot of great horror movies came out with much lower budgets so there is no excuse for this one being so bad. I didn't hate it because it was cheesy and laughable but it is supposed to be a horror movie and it is far from being horrifying. Watch it for laughs and cheesy acting.
