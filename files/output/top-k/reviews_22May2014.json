Certainly Mr. King has some stinkers attached to his name, but I have to say that Creepshow 2 has to be the absolute worst. Dreadfully executed and ineptly casted it was a real chore to sit through.Story the First, Chief Wood'nhead, has George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour in it, which is sad considering they've been in much better films. From the get go there's no doubt in your mind that the damn Indian statue is gonna come to life because they have it moving in the first shots. No suspense at all. So much of the opening is devoted to setting up the couple as nice old people that when revenge time comes around it's rushed through way too fast. The shotgun guy acts well and it's a shame he isn't given much more to do. Really lame. Also, they should have called the Indian Chief Rubberhead.Story the Second, the Raft, a genuinely unsettling and creepy King story is turned into....something. HORRIBLY acted. Line delivery is so bad you don't want to pay attention to what they're saying. In the setup they say how the raft is left on the lake, which means people DO swim in it, and it's not some other lake or raft they're talking about. So it makes the whole NO SWIMMING ending kind of stupid. I guess the monster has the summers off. The trash bag on the water monster effects brought me back to the Creeping Terror. The characters are really unlikable, and i can't tell if that's intentional or just really bad acting. By the time the kids have been whittled down to two, they decide to go soft-core for no reason. It makes no sense at the time or for the characters to do that.Story the Third, the Hitchhiker. The lady driver's constant monologue is so bland and flatly delivered it refused to go into long term memory. The rest of it is so-so for a horror short, less to gripe about than the previous two, but still not free from the flick's many flaws.Then there's the animation. Uncle scrotum-chin (if the animation is any indication) gives some kid the comic book version of Creepshow 2, it's probably better than the movie version. I know it's Creepshow, but the animation is just ugly and off-putting. When the Uncle Scrotor character turns real it makes you wonder why they bothered making Tom Savini up like that in the first place. It adds nothing to the film. It ends with him throwing a bunch of comics off the back of a truck and driving away (much like the creators of the movie did with a good story and technical expertise). The closing music is very odd and out of place for a horror film. It made me wonder if they had stock closing credit music in the public domain that they could just use for free. Cutting down the production costs on this to negative dollars.Kind of upset I watched it finally, but I guess the stories are still there. AVOID.

Have you ever had a dream so outlandish that you know it could not have actually happened but you remember it like a real memory? That nightmare is Alan Parker's Pink Floyd's The Wall. This movie is the closest I have ever seen to an actual nightmare. This movie was quoted as being the most unpleasant experience of Alan Parker's life, it caused much tension between Roger Waters and the rest of Pink Floyd and Roger Waters did not like the end result. Although all of this is unfortunate for those involved, what came out of this misery was a fantastic film. The almost complete lack of dialogue, the excellent usage of Pink Floyd's captivating album, and the surreal animation sections of the film makes this film a visual and auditory experience. The film hits the themes of the aftermath that war left on people and Britain, corrupt teachers (excellent and infamous Another Brick in The Wall Part 2 scene), marriage, fascism as an allegory for fame, and the events in life that snowball into human isolation; the building of The Wall. I pulled a one nighter (new term I made up) and listened to the whole album of The Wall then watched the film. I expected disturbing, screwed up, and rock and roll fueled anger and sorrow and I did get it, but one emotion I did not expected accumulated from this listening and viewing; sadness. Both the film and the album are practically the story of a man secluded himself from everyone and it is a very alienating and depressing experience. Through all of the violent imagery and all out bizarreness, there is a deep human message at the center-most brick of The Wall. That is why it seems like a plausible nightmare. The Wall is not always easy to watch and most won't even like it, but it is hard to admit that it is not oddly fascinating.Ultimately everything about this movie surprised me. The direction, the animation, the narrative, the cinematography (incredibly ahead of it's time); all amazing!!! One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the performance as the troubled rock star and protagonist, Pink, by Boomtown Rat's Bob Geldoff. Geldoff was not an actor. He did not like Pink Floyd. He could not be more different than Pink (in fact, violence makes Geldoff sick) but casting Geldoff for some weird reason, was genius. Geldoff pulls off a convincing, wordless performance as Pink. Final tidbit Although I am a lover of film, I tend to get easily distracted by social media and other things during films.

Ironically, as a fan of British movies, I was surprised to learn that this movie was produced by New Yorker Mel Brooks, a departure from his usual slapstick comedies. He also produced The Elephant Man and his wife Anne Bancroft appeared in both, as did Anthony Hopkins. The film is based on a book by Helene Hanff, one of the two main characters. This story took place during a the period from 1949 to the end of the nineteen sixties. The plot neatly shifts from New York to London as the two leading characters exchange letters as part of their antiquarian book transactions. Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins are excellent in the roles that bring together Helene Hanff and Frank Doel over their shared love of books. We hear voiceovers from both as each character reads their own letters. This is a touch that fits in beautifully with the movie. Frank is very businesslike in his role as the bookstore manager. The feeling of elation or disappointment are palpable as Bancroft opens the packages she receives from her London bookseller. Bancroft is an animated script writer whose love of literature is well matched with Anthony Hopkins' own vast knowledge of the book business, particularly the market for antique books and first editions. Bancroft is a single woman with close friends but no life partner; however, she is bright and witty with a great zest for life and especially for English literature. (Frequent cutaways to the portrait of a sailor strongly hint at a past romance.) Hopkins is a very proper English gentleman who is married with a young family when they first became acquainted. He runs an efficient book business with a staff committed to the quality service he exemplifies. Judy Dench has a minor role as Frank's wife Nora, whose main appearance comes towards the end of the film. Bancroft's love of books sparks Frank's interest and he gives excellent service, which she reciprocates with warm, witty and very funny letters. She tries to burst his natural reserve. He is English to the very core, just as Bancroft is pure wool Manhattan. Over time, the relationship becomes very close. Anne Bancroft's character becomes like a family relative to the staff of Marks and Co, sending gifts of food to the London employees and their loved ones who are coping with post-war rations. At one point, Bancroft's friend visits London but does not connect with Frank who is out of the office at the time.

Sounds like a spy story.I have always considered Alfred Hitchcock among my favorite directors, and after hearing that The 39 Steps was one of his first masterpieces I decided to give it a watch. Several of his classic trademarks from his films in the 50's and 60's can be seen in this spy thriller although they lack a lot of polishing. The story was so rushed that the characters never felt fully developed, the romance felt forced, and the comedy never really worked for me. Despite how much critics revered this film, I had a hard time enjoying the story. The continuity from one scene to the next was a bit jumpy and important details of the story felt like they were left out. I know that for the time it was made (1935) it was highly considered for the fast pace that Hitchcock was introducing to the classic spy tale and for all the surprise and twists that he used here, but those elements haven't really aged well and Hitchcock himself would later go on to polish those issues I had in his following films. In my opinion Hitchcock's earliest masterpiece is his 1940 film, Rebecca, which has much more psychological suspense, better sound editing, and much better character development. The 39 Steps was a bit of a letdown for me, but I still understand why it is so highly regarded for the way in which Hitchcock was able to balance and mix genres such as this spy thriller with romance and comedy. I'm glad Hitchcock managed to polish these common trademarks and cemented his reputation over the following decades (considering my favorite films of his are mostly from the 50's).Charles Bennett and Ian Hay adapted the screenplay from John Buchan's 1915 spy novel centering on Richard Hannay (Robert Donat). Hannay finds himself in trouble with the law when he helps a woman named Annabella Smith (Lucie Mannheim) after a disturbance broke out in a music hall. She is escaping from some secret agents and Hannay takes her to his home where she tells him about a potential national security breach. While she's telling him these things, she is murdered by the men who were following her and Hannay has to escape for his life. He not only has to run from the secret agents who don't want him to discover what they are up to, but from the police as well who suspect him for murdering Anabella. Hannay recalls that Anabella had mentioned something about Scotland so that's where he heads first in order to unlock the mystery of the 39 Steps. Several surprises and twists take place along the way as eventually he is forced to continue on the run handcuffed to a young woman named Pamela (Madeleine Carroll) who doesn't believe he's innocent. The 39 Steps may have been the start of a new kind of thriller inexistent until then, but it hasn't aged as well as other Hitchcock films due its very rushed pacing and poor character development. I honestly can't recall any one character in this film with a definite personality as everyone seems to be playing a specific role to move along the story. There were several comedic moments that Hitchcock was trying to introduce in order to lighten up the mood and suspense, but they didn't work too well for me. The romance between Carroll and Donat's characters wasn't too believable either. I just didn't see the sparks that other critics have found in their performance. I usually tend to like Hitchcock's use of sound in his films and how they enhance the story, but in The 39 Steps it didn't work at all and I found several moments that instead of building the suspense simply felt misplaced. I still respect this film for how it helped form Hitchcock's career, but I can't call it a masterpiece. I will continue to claim Rebecca is his earliest masterpiece.

Certain stars became synonymous with screwball comedy, and two of the most popular were William Powell and Carole Lombard. Once married, these two geniuses remained close friends, and so when the opportunity came for them to work together again in My Man Godfrey, they jumped at the chance. Even if they had hated each other, looking at the script might have changed their mind in turning it down.When snooty socialite Gail Patrick tries to get forgotten man William Powell to come back to a Park Avenue shindig with her to help her win first prize, he retaliates by pushing her in an ash pile. Witness Carole Lombard (Patrick's daffy sister) convinces Powell to help her win, and before you know it, Powell has been hired as the eccentric family's new butler. He has no idea of what he's gotten himself into, between mother Alice Brady's vision of pixies (Don't step on the little things, she insists), father Eugene Palette's constant grumbling over increasing expenses and dwindling profits, Patrick's temper tantrums and Lombard's extreme attempts to win Powell's affection. Then, there's Brady's protegee, Mischa Auer, a stupid man with little human value whose one talent is imitating a gorilla, the wise-cracking maid (Jean Dixon) and a visiting millionaire (Alan Mowbray) who knows certain truths about Powell which threatens to blow his real identity out of the Fifth Avenue mansion.Excellent from start to finish, My Man Godfrey is sure to be on everybody's top five list of the best screwball comedies ever made and in the top 25 of the funniest films ever made. The New York social scene of the 1930's is shown as ridiculous and spoiled, with the scavenger hunt one of the funniest crowd scenes in films. Franklin Pangborn is outrageous as the frazzled host, perplexed one minute then delighted another with the odd objects these silly and basically worthless wealthy people bring in. There's a lesson to be told here, that money doesn't buy happiness (or even rent it for that matter), that spoiled people won't always get what they want, and that lazy hangers-on will get the heave-ho when it's time to go. Everybody here has a chance to shine in a screenplay that is a gem from start to finish. Lombard is one of the few 1930's actresses who seems totally modern, as if she was Drew Barrymore transplanted back in time to stand out among the typical 30's Hollywood glamour. No matter how silly or serious the characters she played, she is someone that few people could find any reason to dislike. Powell went from villain to romantic leading man to comic gem, and in a few moments here, he truly can break your heart. Alice Brady plays a character truly blinded by her dimwiteddness, someone who truly thinks she's smart but is obviously fooling herself. Palette has a memorable explosion at his no-good family, while Patrick particularly stands out in a scene where she suddenly wakes up and sees the truth. This is the type of film that makes you long for those good old days of Hollywood glamour where intelligent writing, strong direction, lavish production values and brilliant acting all come together in one neat package. There is a reason why some films stand the test of time more than others, and My Man Godfrey is a prime example of one of those films.

Palette has a memorable explosion at his no-good family, while Patrick particularly stands out in a scene where she suddenly wakes up and sees the truth. This is the type of film that makes you long for those good old days of Hollywood glamour where intelligent writing, strong direction, lavish production values and brilliant acting all come together in one neat package. There is a reason why some films stand the test of time more than others, and My Man Godfrey is a prime example of one of those films.

As a result the films often draw many comparisons, especially since they are both stories concerning the rise and fall of two charismatic immigrant criminals, both trying desperately to live out their own contrasting visions of the American Dream. While Scarface is now quite rightly considered one of the finest gangster films of the 1980's, in '83 this was not the case. It was critically slammed on release, and its a testament to its ambitious approach to illustrating the drug trade, and Pacino's iconic, unforgettable, almost career-defining performance as Tony Montana, that it has earned such a massive cult following since. Carlito's Way, by comparison, is completely overlooked, and something of a forgotten gem. Pacino's character, Carlito Brigante, is infinitely more likable than the explosive, irrational and ultimately paranoid & treacherous Montana. Its clear from one of the opening scenes in a courtroom, where Brigante is acquitted somewhat miraculously of all charges laid against him. He takes the opportunity to deliver a speech to the court, about how he is a reformed character and a changed man. Deep down he genuinely wants nothing more than to keep his head down, destroy his association with organised crime, and earn enough money in a straight job so he can move to the Caribbean. His lawyer and close friend played by Sean Penn, laughs at this suggestion. His character, by contrast, is a spineless coke-fuelled snake, who respects no-one and betrays Carlito's trust several times in the film. He continues to get on the wrong side of characters you should never cross, and Carlito repeatedly bails him out.Brigante is clearly very streetwise, with Pacino narrating much of the film in first person, and giving a fascinating insight into the mind of an ex-con, whose determined to go straight, despite the continued pressure from those around him, many of whom consider him something of a legend. There is not one scene in this film where the audience can consider him anything less than an genuine, honest, loyal and decent guy. Ironically, its Brigante's own morals and desire never to kill again that seal his fate. Later in the film, street justice is served ice cold, and his demise is as tragic as it is inevitable. Brian De Palmas unique cinematic style serves this film particularly well, with countless memorable tracking shots, the highlight of which has to be the railway station chase scene at the end. One of the most gripping, tense and suspenseful moments of any film I've ever seen.Carlitos Way is a long film, at almost 3 hours, but it passes by in a blur. No scene is too long or too unnecessary, they all serve to paint a vivid and convincing picture of the world these characters inhabit. In Brigante, Pacino portrays a character with dreams and ambitions, that to many seemed far fetched or even absurd, and that despite his honesty and loyalty, he is betrayed by almost everyone close to him, though ultimately he was still a good guy, who only wanted what was best for himself, his girlfriend and his unborn child. He wanted desperately to escape from the violent, cruel world in which he grew up, but it was a part of him, and he couldn't outrun his own past.

The basic premise of the film is fairly dull. A young prep student called Charlie takes a job aiding a blind, lonely, retired colonel over thanksgiving weekend. The weekend turns out to be considerably more eventful than he anticipated, with the Colonel taking him first class to New York for one final bourbon-soaked hurrah, before intending to end his own life. When they head out to the city I expected there to be some good and perhaps amusing scenes where these two completely mismatched characters, one bitter, world weary and cynical, the other innocent, and naive, really get at one another and, to be fair, there are a couple of excellent moments. The tango scene, in which the Colonel dances with a complete stranger, in a classy New York restaurant is truly captivating, and another where he and Charlie test drive a Ferrari around some Brooklyn back-streets is also entertaining, however if a blind man were to drive and drift a Ferrari at over 70mph in real life, there would likely be some very severe consequences. These moments are few and far between however, and with a runtime of 2 ½ hours, the film does begin to drag.Al Pacino has faced up to, and bettered, some outstanding actors in his career (think Johnny Depp in Donnie Brasco, or even De Niro in Heat), but casting him alongside Chris O'Donnell was a big mistake. It's the cinematic equivalent of feeding a lamb to a T-Rex. Pacino simply devours him in every scene; he literally walks all over him. O'Donnell's (non) performance as Charlie is just flat, bland, empty, clichéd and tepid to the point of irritation, and pretty much undermines everything good Pacino brings to the film.Visually, Pacino does an excellent impression of a blind man, to the point where many characters in the film understandably, and believably, don't even notice. Admittedly, he isn't given the best script to work with but he still manages a couple of excellent monologues, most notably in one of the final scenes of the film, which brings me on to another failing of this picture.The subplot, which involves Charlie facing expulsion, as a result of refusing to grass up his peers over a particularly spectacular prank involving the headmaster, just seemed trivial and insignificant, and completely undeserving of Pacino's glorious tirade about integrity, and 'facing the music' which should have really been a highlight of the film. You watch this scene, admire it, and realise there was far too little of it in the preceding 2 hours.In conclusion, had Pacino not received the Oscar for Best Actor at some point in his career it would have been a travesty and an outrage, it's just unfortunate he received it for this role. He was so much better as Michael Corleone in The Godfather, or as ex-con anti-hero Carlito Brigante in Carlito's Way, or even as the overbearing, scenery- chewing, crack snorting gangster icon Tony Montana in Scarface. These are the roles I remember him by, and more importantly, they are vastly superior pieces of Cinema. Scent of a Woman, by comparison, is a mess. The plot is uninspired and boring, the script weak, the characters stereotypical. I've often felt that Al Pacino has an uncanny ability to make poor films average, and average films brilliant, and the former is certainly the case here. The film Two for the Money is another great example of this. A film about sports bettors with Matthew McConaughey that would have certainly been diabolical, and possibly never even released, were it not for Pacino's participation. His somehow makes it watchable... perhaps even.......interesting. Those who are new to his work (I envy you); please watch the other great films I mentioned above, before resorting to this.

Don't get me wrong, X-Men still has plenty to enjoy, but the meatier, more confident recent efforts such as Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and Marvel's own Iron Man (2008) and Thor (2011), as well as the vastly superior sequel two years later, form a rather large shadow over Professor X and his pupils' first outing.In the near future, evolution has taken a huge leap forward, creating 'mutants' - humans with special powers and abilities that defy anything science has seen before. Tensions between humans and mutants is at an all-time high, with the idea of mutant cataloguing being passed around by Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison), despite the efforts of telepaths Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). Mutant Magneto (Ian McKellen), a Holocaust survivor with the ability to control anything magnetic, has different ideas, and plans to induce mutation on world leaders gathering on Ellis Island.As the machine, powered by magnetics, could easily kill him, Magneto seeks Rogue (Anna Paquin), a young girl with the ability to temporarily steal a mutant's power. Having just met Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a beast of a man with a skeleton covered in an indestructible metal, which he can shoot out like claws, and an uncanny healing ability, Rogue's abduction fails and is foiled by Storm (Halle Berry) and Cyclops (James Marsden). They end up in Professor Xavier's school for gifted children, where Wolverine learns about mutant struggle and falls in love with the powerful Jean Grey.With a film this packed with personalities and powers, it's only natural that it loses it's grip on a lot of its characters.

The rest of the characters, with the exception of Professor X and Magneto, do little but fall flat.

Refusing to give in to the idea of comic books being light, colourful and mainly for kids (which was still the general idea back in 2000), the opening scene depicting a young Magneto in a concentration camp ensures this is something that should be taken seriously, yet still enjoyed. Singer grew in confidence and made X2 two years later, which is still considered by myself and many others to be one of the best superhero movies ever made.

The rest of the characters, with the exception of Professor X and Magneto, do little but fall flat. They either suffer because their powers aren't particularly interesting, or spend the duration of the film using what little dialogue they have to explain who they are and what they can do. The movie also has one of the worst lines in cinema history, uttered by Storm. You'll know it when you hear it.For all its lack of ambition and absence of any real set-pieces, X-Men is still the first of its kind. Refusing to give in to the idea of comic books being light, colourful and mainly for kids (which was still the general idea back in 2000), the opening scene depicting a young Magneto in a concentration camp ensures this is something that should be taken seriously, yet still enjoyed. Singer grew in confidence and made X2 two years later, which is still considered by myself and many others to be one of the best superhero movies ever made. X2 showed that the vast ensemble can be given room to breathe, and had the set-pieces to match, and in hindsight, makes X-Men a much tamer, yet still very entertaining, animal.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"22 May 2014","score":"","review":" A guy who choose Hell on Heaven to be with his love, sometimes you lose though you win, these marvelous quotes are from 1998's What Dreams May Come, it's a story of eternal love that continues even after death, it's a story between Physician Chris Nelson and a painter Annie Collins, they love each other a lot, but the tragedy strikes when their loving children end up with a car crash, eventually when both were trying to get rid of that sorrow Chris dies in a road accident this put his wife into depression, Chris move to an imaginary Heaven, where he finds that he is in the painting of his loving wife, and gradually he finds his daughter in her own imaging world of heaven, without able to withstand Chris's departure Annie commit suicide and Chris is said that she is moved to the Hell due to her depressed black imagination, but he never mind to go to the Hell in search of his loving wife, on the way he meets his son who was previously guiding him in his way to Heaven in different form, crossing many obstacles he reaches the place where his wife is seen in the old ruined house, he introduces himself as her neighbor and approach her slowly remanding that he is her husband and showing how much he loves her, initially changing her black sorrow imagination to clean beautiful world of heaven, again they lead a happy life with their children in their imaginary Heaven but finally deciding to reincarnate and begin their life again in the Earth and meet each other again, again falling in love, enjoying those happy moments etc.Though this plot sounds bit strange and beyond the relevant perception, it has that essence that makes you to feel the 'life after the death', death is to your body not to your love and life.

Part of the reason for the films great success is that it's a parody of many of the things that are popular in culture. Everything from cheesy romances to gory horror is mashed together in this bizarre film of insanity that is The Rocky Horror Picture Show.It all begins when our heroine and hero get caught with a flat (how bout that?) so they go in to a nearby mansion to use their phone. Little do they know that there are strange people to occupy that occupy that house with a night filled with monsters, aliens and Transylvania Transvestites to follow. The plot is silly, wacky and makes little sense, making it just right for all the absurdity that happens over the course of the night. Even when the laws of physics are broken, we just shove it off because in this weird world it actually makes sense.But more importantly than that, this weird world allows for some of the best songs in musicals to come out of nowhere. Just like many of the classic musicals, there's never much reason for the music, with the simple act of someone entering a room being cause for a dance number. Certainty these songs are the most memorable moments in the film as well and the main reason that it has become such a cultural hit as each song has a unique style and catchy lyrics which mocks other musical styles in gorgeous fashion, ranging from an Elvis inspired Eddie to the stereotypical musical numbers in the time warp the songs are always original and entertaining.Through this music the film successfully allows viewers to fully embrace the film, with entire audiences getting up to do the dances and sing the lyrics. The most memorable of these tends to be the time warp and sweet transvestite with every lyric in each being both memorable and hilarious. Beyond that, the time warp even tells you exactly what dance you should be doing, meaning there are no excuses for those who say they don't know the dance. Whilst the entire soundtrack is also incredible, these are definitely the leading songs that will get people singing along in any screening.Also I think the film chooses what is probably the perfect cast for their characters. Firstly you have Meatloaf, who whilst only has a short time on screen makes his impact in that time with his fast paced style and legendary singing voice to ensure that we remember his short time on screen. Then there's Richard O'Brien (who is also the writer of the film) playing the handyman and is the lead voice in the now iconic time warp. It's a tough thing for anyone to do his song simply because it's tough for any other singer to match his voice with its ever changing style and impressive vocal range. Brad and Jaret are also perfect as the leads because of how typical they seem at the beginning of the film for a romantic couple. This makes their entry in to the world of insanity far more entertaining.And most importantly lets not forget the legendary Tim Curry. Any moment Frank-N-Furter is on screen, you're damn sure that he dominates the show with his brilliant over the top style perfectly personifying the nature of such an insane character. Certainly if there is any character who anyone can instantly recognise from the film it is Furter. Everything about him makes him stand out amongst an already insane cast, with his ridiculous costume (becoming regular dress for fans) and even more ridiculous voice carrying the perfect tone for such a memorable character.There's been some talk of doing a remake of this film in recent years, though personally I don't think that there should ever be another version. Sure, you can do different versions at the theatre, but this is the definitive version of the film simply because there is nothing that a new film version could add to it. This version carries with it all the charm and humour that no remake could ever recreate with this film standing alone as a unique film in the musical genre.

The action is often violent and the body count is high but there are also moments of humour and romance that add enormously to the enjoyment of the piece.Like 2 Days In The Valley (1996), Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead followed in the wake of Quentin Tarantino's great successes of the early 1990s and the influences of Pulp Fiction and more obviously, Reservoir Dogs are apparent throughout.Jimmy The Saint Tosnia (Andy Garcia) is a retired gangster who's in a difficult position because his legitimate business called Afterlife Advice is losing money. To make matters worse, his debt to some loan sharks is actually owned by his old crime boss who's known as The Man With A Plan (Christopher Walken) and he wants Jimmy to carry out an action for him. Jimmy's in no position to refuse and so rounds up four members of his old gang.The Man With A Plan has a son who, after having been dumped by his girlfriend, turned to child molesting. Jimmy's old boss wants the girlfriend's new fiancé to be scared off in the hope that she'll then decide to reconcile with her previous beau and steer him back into acting normally again!!! Jimmy then arranges for two of his gang members to pose as police officers in a stunt that goes terribly wrong and ends up with both the fiancé and the girlfriend being killed.Predictably, The Man With A Plan doesn't take this news well and hires a contract killer called Mr Shhh (Steve Buscemi) to kill the four gang members in the most painful ways possible and then orders Jimmy to leave Denver within 48 hours or he'll suffer the same fate. Jimmy decides not to leave immediately because he wants to see Dagney (Gabrielle Anwar), the beautiful girl he's fallen in love with, his gang members, who he tries to help in any way that he can and Lucinda (Fairuza Balk), a hooker who values his friendship. Unfortunately, by delaying his departure from Denver for so long, Jimmy even starts to put his own life in danger.It's the quirky characters in this movie that provide most of its entertainment and dark humour. Jimmy is very suave, charming and extremely loyal to his friends and his tendency to put others before himself and to do what's noble is fitting for someone who's nicknamed The Saint. Gang member Pieces (Christopher Lloyd) is a projectionist in a cinema that only shows porn movies and suffers from a disease which causes parts of his body to drop off unexpectedly. Franchise (William Forsythe) runs a trailer park and has a wife who's desperate for him not to get involved with the gang again and Critical Bill (Treat Williams) is a highly volatile, psychotic ex-con who works in a morgue and tries to control his violent urges by beating up corpses which he strings up to use as punch bags. Easy Wind (Bill Nunn) is the forth member of the gang who works in the pest control business and hates Critical Bill because of something bad that went on in prison.Although it's undeniably derivative and contains some dubious dialogue (e.g. girls who glide need guys who make them thump), Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead does have an offbeat appeal, numerous funny moments and some great acting by its wonderful cast.

It scared the crap out of me, and as soon as it was over I ran home. Before now all I could remember about it was the opening scene with the school bus and the bit later on with the kid's tongue becoming a disgusting meaty thing, which at the time was just terrifying. I didn't expect much from rewatching the film all these years later, especially as I've seen the other sequels since and none of them are any good. I thought, honestly, that it would be crap.And it knocked me sideways. I'll be damned if it isn't an entirely effective horror movie. Surprisingly, shockingly and unexpectedly effective. Wow. Now I don't know whether this is in part because the feeling I had when I first saw it was somewhere in the back of my brain, if a weird kind of nostalgia was at work, but I didn't expect such a gripping experience full of genuinely unsettling imagery and an intense atmosphere. I'm in shock a little bit.One of the things that took me aback is just how much impact Freddy has in this movie. The character became so diluted over the course of the series that all sense of menace disappeared, replaced by rubbery make-up and a horror-negating habit of dispatching his victims with a crushingly unfunny one-liner. Here he's used sparingly, the make-up is suitably horrible, he's lit with style, and Robert Englund's performance is nothing like as hammy as in later films. Even his glove gave me the wiggins, what with the sound effects and all. Surprise number two is the sheer amount of freaky images in the movie the opening dream sequence, the bloody blades through the bedroom door, the pool party, Freddy ripping open his scalp, the monstrous rat and cat in the finale. (The tongue scene hasn't aged too well but it's still pretty creepy.) The movie has an escalating sense of sweaty dread, fuelled in part by Christopher Young's oppressive score, and I was on edge throughout. The cast may not be the best bunch of actors around but they certainly sell the sense that reality is coming apart at the seams, Mark Patton as lead character Jesse in particular.On another level entirely, it's fascinating just how homoerotic the movie is. Slasher movies traditionally rely on naked female flesh to get their sexual kicks, but here the emphasis is firmly on the boys, with many exposed and sweaty torsos, and the only nudity in the movie is a male backside getting slapped with a towel (in a bondage heavy death scene). The friendship between Jesse and Grady (Robert Rusler) is convincingly antagonistic but also has an undeniable undercurrent of something beyond platonic male bonding, unless we're supposed to take the scene where a tormented Jesse interrupts sex with his girlfriend to run to Grady's bedroom and beg his shirtless friend to let him sleep there at face value. It's genre bending stuff for a mainstream horror movie, let alone a horror sequel slapped together in the mid 1980s; apparently director Jack Sholder was none the wiser that writer David Chaskin had included this stuff on purpose, which seems weird considering how prominent it is. Sure, Freddy is eventually defeated by the power of heterosexual love (literally) but that doesn't negate the approach of the rest of the movie. The film isn't perfect. Jesse's family seem pretty happy to push aside such minor issues as an exploding bird, an unplugged toaster that catches fire, and their son arriving at the front door naked on the night his coach is murdered. Kim Myers gets her act together in time for the finale but until then is wet as anything. And to look at it all objectively, I suppose it is pretty cheesy and doesn't make much sense.But it really works, I can't deny it. I'll have to go back and watch the original again now. I didn't much like it before but who knows how much it might improve, given another chance?

I didn't expect much from rewatching the film all these years later, especially as I've seen the other sequels since and none of them are any good. I thought, honestly, that it would be crap.And it knocked me sideways. I'll be damned if it isn't an entirely effective horror movie. Surprisingly, shockingly and unexpectedly effective. Wow. Now I don't know whether this is in part because the feeling I had when I first saw it was somewhere in the back of my brain, if a weird kind of nostalgia was at work, but I didn't expect such a gripping experience full of genuinely unsettling imagery and an intense atmosphere. I'm in shock a little bit.One of the things that took me aback is just how much impact Freddy has in this movie. The character became so diluted over the course of the series that all sense of menace disappeared, replaced by rubbery make-up and a horror-negating habit of dispatching his victims with a crushingly unfunny one-liner. Here he's used sparingly, the make-up is suitably horrible, he's lit with style, and Robert Englund's performance is nothing like as hammy as in later films. Even his glove gave me the wiggins, what with the sound effects and all. Surprise number two is the sheer amount of freaky images in the movie the opening dream sequence, the bloody blades through the bedroom door, the pool party, Freddy ripping open his scalp, the monstrous rat and cat in the finale. (The tongue scene hasn't aged too well but it's still pretty creepy.) The movie has an escalating sense of sweaty dread, fuelled in part by Christopher Young's oppressive score, and I was on edge throughout. The cast may not be the best bunch of actors around but they certainly sell the sense that reality is coming apart at the seams, Mark Patton as lead character Jesse in particular.On another level entirely, it's fascinating just how homoerotic the movie is. Slasher movies traditionally rely on naked female flesh to get their sexual kicks, but here the emphasis is firmly on the boys, with many exposed and sweaty torsos, and the only nudity in the movie is a male backside getting slapped with a towel (in a bondage heavy death scene). The friendship between Jesse and Grady (Robert Rusler) is convincingly antagonistic but also has an undeniable undercurrent of something beyond platonic male bonding, unless we're supposed to take the scene where a tormented Jesse interrupts sex with his girlfriend to run to Grady's bedroom and beg his shirtless friend to let him sleep there at face value. It's genre bending stuff for a mainstream horror movie, let alone a horror sequel slapped together in the mid 1980s; apparently director Jack Sholder was none the wiser that writer David Chaskin had included this stuff on purpose, which seems weird considering how prominent it is. Sure, Freddy is eventually defeated by the power of heterosexual love (literally) but that doesn't negate the approach of the rest of the movie. The film isn't perfect. Jesse's family seem pretty happy to push aside such minor issues as an exploding bird, an unplugged toaster that catches fire, and their son arriving at the front door naked on the night his coach is murdered. Kim Myers gets her act together in time for the finale but until then is wet as anything. And to look at it all objectively, I suppose it is pretty cheesy and doesn't make much sense.But it really works, I can't deny it. I'll have to go back and watch the original again now. I didn't much like it before but who knows how much it might improve, given another chance?

That said, the dialogue and performances are brutal at times and that's largely what weakens the film for me these days. The film relies on the strength of its characters and their interaction with each other to draw us into the plot, and no one here is really up to the challenge. Also, there are too many weird, distracting details like the plastic button that can scratch metal. It's certainly not a bad film by any means, but its flaws are too glaring for it to fully succeed. It is a lot better than the two pointless sequels that followed, however.

In comparison, the remake is pretty good. It makes use of the fact that it has a bigger budget which makes the story of a man who has discovered how to capture ghost with technology more realistic. The remake also has a series of ghost that are pretty scary.The biggest issue with this movie is that the gimmick somewhat gets in the way of the scary. William Castle was known for his gimmicks and in this one he gives us a set of glasses that we need to use to see the ghost or not see them based on what you believe in. I saw the movie without this device and maybe that effected how scary I thought the ghost were.The best part was at the beginning when the opening title showed us the symbols of the ghost which was chilling. I think it was one of those films that was made for the first wave of 3D culture and became dated as a result.

This story is about racial tension and violence that occurs in a neighborhood.Other members of the cast includes Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Richard Edson, Giancarlo Esposito, Bill Nunn, John Turturro, and Samuel L. Jackson together with Martin Lawrence and Rosie Perez,both of whom are in their first film.There are three businesses that dominate the neighborhood block that mainly consists of African-Americans namelya radio station,owned by an African-American disc jockey;a convenience store owned by a Korean couple; and Sal's Famous Pizzeria, the only white-operated business in the neighborhood. Sal serves pizzas to his two sons.Sal's ambassador to the community is a likable local young guy named Mookie, a pizza delivery guy who spreads news and gossip in the local community. When an African-American customer notes that Sal's Wall of Fame, a photo gallery of famous Italian-Americans, does not include anyone from his ethnic background, he eventually demands a neighborhood boycott.When tensions are already running high among the people of the neighborhood,it results to death and violence in the end. Also,we meet different characters from different races such as Da Mayor, a kind of every man who knows everybody; Buggin Out, a vocal militant; Radio Raheem, whose boom box defines his life and provides a musical cocoon to insulate him from the world; Mother Sister, who is sort of the neighborhood witch;a local disk jockey, whose program provides a running commentary, and a retarded street person who wanders around selling photos of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X.The film provided a accurate and realistic view of the race relations at the time of its release.It captures the sense of black pride that is caught in both essentialism and commercialism as shown by trash-talking racism, distrust, and males' insistence on respect.Additionally,it also provides the viewer an understanding of the problems behind racial tensions from both Caucasians and African-Americans as well as their fears and frustrations.Overall,it was a solid,entertaining and very well-made film and well-acted by an ensemble cast.Danny Aiello provides a great performance as Sal.
