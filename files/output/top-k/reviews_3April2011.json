They poke fun at secret identities and costumes...these guys are just as concerned with allying their super persona with coherent themed branding so they can be recognizable to potential fans.The movie is a parody on a genre that hadn't quite gotten its footing in the mainstream yet, and I'm sure that was its real downfall. Quite frankly with the A-list cast it should've been more financially successful regardless of the script, I just don't think many people quite knew what to make of it. If you were one of the many who was disappointed or in some way put off by this film back '99 I would recommend giving it a second shot. I never really hated it in the first place but my rating has definitely gone up and I've discovered a whole new appreciation for it.

The other three were all rather large and ambitious films in their own different ways Louis Malle's Atlantic CITY, Spielberg's legendary RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and Warren Beatty's flawed but compelling REDS.Of these, I must give a nod to Spielberg, since it would still be a decade before he would get the recognition he deserved. But as good as RAIDERS is, my favorite film of 1981 is Mark Rydell's ON GOLDEN POND, a little film that was released very late in 1981 amid almost no fanfare, a surprising move considering its cast Henry Fonda in what would be his last film, Katharine Hepburn in the last role worthy of her, and Jane Fonda as the estranged daughter. I remember that the film came to town and just stayed, becoming a sleeper that before long everyone was talking about as the best thing they'd seen in years.Henry Fonda is Norman Thayer Jr, a retired professor facing his eightieth birthday with his wife Ethel (Hepburn) at their summer cottage on the titular pond (actually a good sized lake). Soon their estranged daughter Chelsea (Jane), a divorcée, arrives on the scene with her new boyfriend (Dabney Coleman) and his teenage son (Doug McKeon) in tow.The tension between Norman and Chelsea is almost palpable, yet it soon becomes obvious that these two have been mad at each other for so long that neither of them remembers why, despite a passing remark late in the film that seems to indicate that Chelsea felt she was a disappointment to her father just because she was a girl.Chelsea and her beau are off for a month in Europe, and she persuades her parents to take care of the boy while they're gone. Norman is a bit reluctant, but agrees.The eminent critic Roger Ebert, in his review of this film, had this to saySimple affection is so rare in the movies. Shyness and resentment are also seldom seen. Love is much talked-about, but how often do we really believe that the characters are in love and not simply in a pleasant state of lust and like? Fragile emotions are hard to portray in a movie, and the movies that reach for them are more daring, really, than movies that bludgeon us with things like anger and revenge, which are easy to portray.In the central section of the film, the old man and the boy uneasily move from suspicion to acceptance to friendship to something that looks very much like love. It is one of Fonda's greatest performances in a career of great work, and young McKeon is a revelation, holding his own against his two older co-stars with remarkable aplomb.Hepburn is in some ways the heart of the film. At the very beginning, when she calls her husband's attention to the sound of the loons, and he replies that he hears nothing, watch the look on her face. There are a lot of those looks. A great deal is communicated without dialogue in this film. Even the final confrontation between father and daughter is done with a minimum of talk, and I defy anyone not to shed a tear during this scene.This is THE best picture of 1981, a small picture with a big heart that will surely affect even the most hardened moviegoer.

It's beyond just warm and colorful, with scenes of Venice night and day, and beyond just triumphant, with true love winning in more ways than one. It is most of all populated with great characters. Italian leading lady Licia Maglietta is a wonder of naturalistic acting. She is sympathetic of course, but not a cliché. She plays a housewife on a diversion away from her family, and she looks and acts like a housewife. As strong as she is, and as independent, she is also devoted to her family. The fact she left them at all is perfectly unfolded as an accident that she turns into an opportunity, all by intuition. The man she meets is no paradigm of handsome or charming, in fact he's just the opposite. But he is so inherently good, a really decent human being, she comes to like him, and look out for him. Played by Swiss actor Bruno Ganz, he matches Maglietta's believable ease and imperfect, quiet intensity. The rest of the cast is truly supportive, and tips just slightly (or more than slightly in one case) into caricature, to reminds us, I suppose, that this is a movie, a fantasy, a comedy in many ways.But it's also a deeply serious and moving love story between two middle-aged people who are ready for renewal.I have a feeling many people, especially people with families or those conservative at heart, will find the basic premise of a woman leaving her family in a glib and almost carefree way and not going back for a long time to be shameful or even sinful. Her kids are normal distracted teenagers who like her when they notice her, her husband is a hardworking and loud businessman who doesn't beat her, her home is her own and comfortable. In other words, she has a really normal life, a good one by most measures. Does everyone have the right to up and leave a working family relationship because they feel a bit restless? Is this movie a worship of selfishness?Or is it a reminder that life is short and you have to get to what really matters, and be with people who are truly wonderful and good, no matter what?I can't think of a more joyous way to ask the question.

Plinckett's review of 'Insurrection'.From watching the Plinckett review of 'Insurrection', one gets the idea that 'Insurrection' was written in a single afternoon by someone with little writing credential. For this reason I have found 'Fade In' a fascinating read, though partly in that kind of perverse sense in which you might watch the supplemental material included on a DVD of a movie you didn't enjoy--commentaries, Making Of featurettes, etc. Who was behind this; what went wrong; why did they spend all this time and money on such a mediocre film? I was surprised to learn that the screen writer, Michael Piller, is actually a veteran screenwriter (at least on television) where he wrote many classic STTNG episodes. It appears that he was much more restrained here than he ever was for a TV episode. The screenplay went through hundreds of drafts and tweaks, including significant executive meddling given the comparatively higher investment for a movie. It does seem as though the movie would have been better if he'd been granted greater creative control.There were also some budgetary restraints, which sometimes dictated the story elements. However, I wouldn't say that these justify the story here being sub-par. 'Serenity' was made on a smaller budget and is still a much better sci-fi movie.After watching the Plinckett review, the sheer number of glaring plot holes in 'Insurrection' does call into question whether Piller really knew what he was doing. I noticed that many of Plinckett's criticisms were actually the very same concerns that had been raised while the script was still being written. Paramount raised all of the following questions- How is the Baku race just 600 people, do they have children, and why haven't they died off from inbreeding? (question from Paramount executives)- Why is Starfleet bending to the demands of weird aliens, why are the aliens employing the help of Starfleet? They appear to possess much advanced technology. The Enterprise was poorly matched against their fleet. They probably could have deployed the Collector without ever having gotten Starfleet involved or even registered on Starfleet's radar they indicated that this was a fairly out-of-the-way planet, and it was surrounded in some kind of sensor-jamming ion storm.It seems from 'Fade In' that Piller wanted to write 'Insurrection' as a short, sweet Picard story, with themes of love, regrowth, rejuvenation, old & young. But at each step, he was thwarted by executives who told him that he needed less dialogue, faster pacing, more action, cool weapons, and a big space battle involving a large explosion. Many viewers, including Plickett, complained about how Picard's behavior veers widely from TV Picard; however, Piller had intended this precise change in Picard's outlook on life to be the film's primary arc, his hero's journey as Piller stated it. Earlier versions of the screenplay devoted much dialogue to establishing this change in Picard; however, Piller was forced to minimize this dialogue and much of what *was* filmed of these scenes was later cut. I think that Piller was trying to veer the film into a character-building direction, while everyone else involved was trying to veer it into a big-dumb-action-movie direction, and so the tone of the resultant product is very confused because Piller essentially just can't really write film-grade action.Overall a very dull effort, with nothing of lasting value to Star Trek. Aesthetically, both new alien races are duller than dull, with the Baku not even possessing a single distinctive non-human trait. Their clothing and village set pieces show zero creative effort. Although this was intended as a spiritual companion to The Search For Spock and The Journey Home, people will continue to discuss the latter two movies for decades to come; nothing in 'Insurrection' has similar lasting value.

Hinton, the story treads on the familiar territory of group conflicts among teens. There are the Greasers versus the Socs (pronounced sohshes--the social elite) in 1960s Tulsa. Of course we are encouraged to identify with the Greasers as the underdogs, and indeed their lives are hard with parents who are not there, or who are there and don't care about their kids. Among the cast of budding young stars it is C. Thomas Howell (as Ponyboy), Ralph Macchio (as Johnny) and Matt Dillon (as Dallas) who get the most screen time. The setup of the conflict between the two gangs is done well enough with Ponyboy falling for one of the Socs' girls, provoking a jealously-fueled retaliation. This comes while Johnny and Ponyboy are talking in the park one night when a group of Socs shows up and attacks them, resulting in a killing that has Johnny and Ponyboy going on the lam. They wind up at an abandoned church upon the advice of Dallas who is the go-to guy among the Greasers. It is some of the scenes at the church that I found hardest to digest, such as the one that has Ponyboy reciting Robert Frost's Nothing Gold Can Stay to Johnny while bathed in the amber light of a sunset. Also, Ponyboy reads Gone with the Wind out loud to Johnny during their stay. Who thought that Greasers could be so sensitive. To disguise themselves Ponyboy and Johnny decide to cut off their hair and this amounts to clipping a few strands--I suppose the director did not want to lose the attractiveness of the two handsome young actors. Another hokey scene has Johnny and Ponyboy rescuing some children from a burning building. Just in case self defense would not get them off, best to make them heroes.No surprise that the climactic scene is a rumble between the two gangs. One scene that struck me as truthful was between one of the Socs and Ponyboy that had the Soc saying that no matter if the Greasers won the rumble, they would still be on the bottom of the heap, still losers in society.This movie has some personal significance to me since I graduated from the same Tulsa high school a few years before Hinton wrote her book while in school there. It was good to see some of the old Tulsa landmarks in the film like the Bowen Lounge and the Admiral Twin drive-in that had back-to-back screens. When I was at the school it was pretty much all kids from middle-class families. I don't recall there being even a hint of the type of thing that was portrayed in the movie.

Most are re-examined decades later and deemed ahead of their time. Norman Jewison's film, however, is so complex and earnest in its portrait of race relations in the 1960s that audiences were stirred by it then as much as we commend it now.What makes In the Heat of the Night as effective now as it was in 1967 has to be the approach. Neither the script nor the direction tackle racism head-on in an explicit manner; the film slowly builds racial tension by feeding off viewer assumptions and creating racist undertones in the characters and their actions.When we first meet Detective Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier), he's being arrested on suspicion for murder. He doesn't say so much as a word and the clear implication is that he's being arrested because he's black, but the characters and situations are composed in such a way that the racism doesn't feel blatant or entirely addressed. The dialogue does not confront the topic in explicit terms either. Instead, we have an unsettled and discomforting mood.We also never get a real beat on Police Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger). Both the character and Steiger's performance possess real depth and complexity. Few characters in cinema history (and none that I can think of at present) have characteristics that include deeply rooted prejudice and great understanding. Steiger so perfectly communicates Gillespie's conundrum of reconciling what he believes and the evidence that rests before his eyes, both in the murder investigation and the way he treats Tibbs.Tibbs is a Philadelphia detective with a strong forensics background who finds himself in Sparta, Mississippi assisting with a homicide case. Given that Civil Rights was a relatively new concept in America at the time, the racist attitudes and suspicious glares of the other small- town cops cast a heavy shadow over Tibbs' work. Poitier gives Tibbs this humble courageousness for much of the film but occasionally gives in to the anger the viewer will surely feel for the way his character is treated.In the Heat of the Night truly portrays the sorry state of the South in the wake of Jim Crow laws, a time when long-standing attitudes struggled to adjust and frankly, some never did. Steiger's Chief Gillespie represents the crux of this change as he begins to admit the errors of his judgement both in judging Tibbs and in doing his job. As equally powerful as the film's statement on race is its statement on the flaws of the justice system in certain parts of the country. Without Tibbs' help, two innocent men would have been tried and likely convicted of the murder thanks to the old Western sense of justice, that being someone has to pay.There are some head-shaking and jaw-dropping moments in the film, but In the Heat of the Night mostly succeeds in being subtle and displaying racism through tension more so than action. The truth is that while the frightening tales of hate crimes are much more compelling for the screen, this form of racism is what truly abounds, even today. With a couple knockout performances, the ideas of racism and justice in the film become much more than &#x97; pardon the pun &#x97; black and white.~Steven CVisit my site http\/\/moviemusereviews.com ","genre":null},{"date":"3 April 2011","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Rarely does a socially progressive film receive the accolades it deserves immediately following its release like In the Heat of the Night did.

Both the character and Steiger's performance possess real depth and complexity. Few characters in cinema history (and none that I can think of at present) have characteristics that include deeply rooted prejudice and great understanding. Steiger so perfectly communicates Gillespie's conundrum of reconciling what he believes and the evidence that rests before his eyes, both in the murder investigation and the way he treats Tibbs.Tibbs is a Philadelphia detective with a strong forensics background who finds himself in Sparta, Mississippi assisting with a homicide case. Given that Civil Rights was a relatively new concept in America at the time, the racist attitudes and suspicious glares of the other small- town cops cast a heavy shadow over Tibbs' work. Poitier gives Tibbs this humble courageousness for much of the film but occasionally gives in to the anger the viewer will surely feel for the way his character is treated.In the Heat of the Night truly portrays the sorry state of the South in the wake of Jim Crow laws, a time when long-standing attitudes struggled to adjust and frankly, some never did. Steiger's Chief Gillespie represents the crux of this change as he begins to admit the errors of his judgement both in judging Tibbs and in doing his job. As equally powerful as the film's statement on race is its statement on the flaws of the justice system in certain parts of the country. Without Tibbs' help, two innocent men would have been tried and likely convicted of the murder thanks to the old Western sense of justice, that being someone has to pay.There are some head-shaking and jaw-dropping moments in the film, but In the Heat of the Night mostly succeeds in being subtle and displaying racism through tension more so than action. The truth is that while the frightening tales of hate crimes are much more compelling for the screen, this form of racism is what truly abounds, even today.

Most are re-examined decades later and deemed ahead of their time. Norman Jewison's film, however, is so complex and earnest in its portrait of race relations in the 1960s that audiences were stirred by it then as much as we commend it now.What makes In the Heat of the Night as effective now as it was in 1967 has to be the approach. Neither the script nor the direction tackle racism head-on in an explicit manner; the film slowly builds racial tension by feeding off viewer assumptions and creating racist undertones in the characters and their actions.When we first meet Detective Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier), he's being arrested on suspicion for murder. He doesn't say so much as a word and the clear implication is that he's being arrested because he's black, but the characters and situations are composed in such a way that the racism doesn't feel blatant or entirely addressed. The dialogue does not confront the topic in explicit terms either. Instead, we have an unsettled and discomforting mood.We also never get a real beat on Police Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger).

It's a slow movie, choosing to showcase characters and dialogue over the battle scenes. Which is fine as the characters and dialogue are both exceptionally good, and the acting is, for the most part, fine. But there are so many characters, with so many conversations and so many back-stories, by the end I had trouble keeping track of any of them. The battle scenes, however, are fantastic. Long and brutal, they really are great to watch, though a PG rating prevents them from being appropriately brutal and therefore realistic. I also didn't like how one-sided the battles were. Though the movie is quite balanced and has main characters on both sides of the conflict, the battles are only shown one side at a time. The first big battle on Little Big Top is shown entirely from the Union's point of view, and the ending battle is shown entirely from the Confederates point of view, which kind of hurt the movie and it's character development. For instance, Colonel Chamberlain, is shown anticipating the final battle, but is never actually shown in the battle, nor is he shown afterwards until the final scene, so we have no idea how he held up or what he was doing throughout the entire battle. All in all, though, this was a pretty good movie, and a great experience, though it would have been better if it wasn't four hours long.

While none of the sequels produced under the Paramount banner are bad, this one falls a bit short of the previous three.Don't take it the wrong way it's still very much everything a Friday the 13th film should be. There are creative death scenes, some good suspenseful set pieces, and Jason is as scary as he'll ever be. But something seems to be lacking this time around that sets it apart from its older brothers and sisters.For one, the characters this time around are genuinely un-likable. You might think this funny, considering it's a Friday the 13th film, but the previous entries at least contained some characters that we could root for. Here, there are about a total of two characters that don't verge of being so gratingly annoying that we want them to die. And, fittingly, they happen to be the main ones.This time out, Jason escapes the hospital morgue after he is pronounced dead after the end of the third film and makes his way to a rental house in the country, conveniently occupied by a group of some very annoying young adults. Living next door is the Jarvis family--mother, young son, teenage daughter, and dog, Gordon.This film introduces young Tommy Jarvis (played very well by a young Corey Feldman)--a character who would go on to star in the next two sequels (albeit with different actors).Tom Savini returns to the make-up chair for this one following an absence from the previous two films, supplying a variety of gruesome special effects.The atmosphere is certainly more 80s than any entry before it, with the film's fashion and choice of music reeking of bad nostalgia involving poofy hair and over-sized dress\/shirt thingys with big belts around the waist (what the heck were those?).The atmosphere is darker than the previous films, with the murders being more mean-spirited and ugly this time around. A sudden rainstorm certainly helps attribute to this as well.As Jason slices his way through the annoying cast (imagine being at a party with sluts who will try to steal your boyfriend right in front of you, an ugly jokester who no girl in the cast wants to sleep with, and one of the most timid, boring girls ever in a Friday the 13th film and you'll get what I mean), the brother of one of Jason's victims searches the woods surrounding Crystal Lake for revenge. Word of advice looking for revenge against Jason = not a good idea. You will lose.The finale is entertaining and contains some genuinely suspenseful moments involving a running Jason and a chase sequence that goes back and forth between the two houses, and Jason's demise is gory and satisfying enough. But, of course, he will be back, making The Final Chapter on the film's title seem like nothing more than a cash-grab.It's an entertaining ride and certainly necessary viewing if you enjoyed the previous films, but it doesn't quite match up.

So many good and funny scenes with dad learning to play the mom role. And he played it so humorously well. I thought it was great how the mom, dad reacted with their children and one another, very caring and realistic. The movie made one realize that you do whatever you need to do to keep your family going through rough times and also makes you realize how much you mean to one another. So realistic and yet funny. Definitely a feel-good movie.

Ryan delivers her lines without really lighting up the screen. Certainly she doesn't give the sort of performance that convinces me that she is worth giving up immortality for but not much more is asked of her so she at least get's pass marks.However, they are both a pale shadow against Braugher who's delivery is out-of-this-world. Whenever I watch this film I wonder why it wasn't a smash hit. The angels walking amongst the population is as pure an artistic delivery as I have seen on film. Unfortunately, by the end of the film it is all too clear why the box office didn't bite. It is just too depressing throughout.
