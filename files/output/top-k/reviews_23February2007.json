The lobby scene was spectacular, and there is also a lot of hidden meaning within the film. Neo is an anagram of one, Morpheus was a Greek god of discovery (I think), Trinity is a blatant reference to the holy trinity, the ship Nebuchchadnezza is a Biblical reference to King Nebuch Chadnezza, the other crew members - Mouse, Psyther, Switch, Apoc all reference computers in some way, and the pilots and children of Zion - Tank, Dozer both refer to mechanics in some way. It's awesome. P.S can people stop bad mouthing the sequels? They were great films. People just think they were bad because they compare them with this and that makes them look bad. This film cast a huge shadow which was almost unbeatable, but accept that they were still pretty damn good.

It is truly deserving. I am at a bit of a loss as to how this film has gotten lost among many other so-called great westerns. This film makes a very strong case for my top western (along with The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, The Shootist, and The Searchers), and certainly top 10 movie of all time!There are so many rare and great things about this film -- let me just point to a few. First, the movie, at almost 3 hrs long, has no dull, lagging spots! There is not a scene or a section which you want to fast-forward through to get to the good parts. This is very unusual for a film of this length.Second, the character development in this film is amazing. Not because the protagonist and the antagonist are developed so well (although they are), but because there are so MANY characters developed to such a great extent. This may well be the reason for the fact in the previous point. Peck, Heston, Conners, Ives, Bickford, Baker, Simmons, and Bedoya, and even Ol' Thunder the horse (!) are interesting, and more than watchable. By the time the film is through, you feel as if you've known each and every one very well!Thirdly, this film effectively does what many try to do and fail (but at which Wyler was very good), and many marginal movies never even attempt. Simply put, half of the dialogue in this movie, isn't. You learn every bit as much about all the characters by their expressions and their actions as by their lines. Brilliant acting, and even more brilliant directing.Fourth, there are many great scenes in this movie! It is not full of non-stop, shoot-em-up, action -- it is so much better than that! The scene at the beginning as Peck gets off the stage is good -- his (eventful) trip to the ranch with his fiancé, the Ol' Thunder showdown, Burl Ives entry (which is AMAZING and powerful!), Peck's trip to the old ranch house and Big Muddy, the fight between Heston and Peck (which some have criticized for the slow pacing, outcome, and distant camera-work, but which I think is poignant, rare, and a turning point in the film), and the list goes on and on...Fifth, as so many have said -- the music is absolutely wonderful! It is powerful, uplifting, and very, very hummable! -)There are so many things which I love about this film, which are to many to continually elaborate upon. Wyler's treatment of the story and its characters is suburb. Each and every character is true to form throughout without inconsistencies, and each one is powerful in his or her own way. This is a magnificent western for everyone. See it!!

But this movie is far more. It is a story of the human spirit. It is a testimony to the power of conviction; that drive and desire can achieve more than strength of arms. The simple belief that Right triumphs over Evil is the center of Braveheart. As a result, it bands us, as the audience, together for the common good; victory.William Wallace is a compelling historical character because it was never his intention to be a freedom fighter. He left his homeland as a small boy amidst family tragedy and spent many years abroad. He returns to Scotland a new man. He is smarter than his brethren, not that he flaunts it. Initially, we do not see an idealistic Scottish rebel. He is a simple man with simple desires; to live in peace and raise a family.Circumstances make that impossible. The circumstance of living in an oppressed country makes a simple life unattainable. This leads to tragedy, which leads to rage. Rage leads to conflict, which leads to victory. Victory leads to purpose. This is where the movie takes shape. The movie takes shape when Wallace realizes that his purpose is no longer exacting revenge. He is meant to lead an uprising.Braveheart, for all its battle scenes, is a political picture about a desire for something better, as Wallace describes it. He has seen his people suffer. He has seen the Scottish people accept their place as a second class society and settle. There is no belief that this will ever change. While the uprising begins as a product of revenge, we get the sense that Wallace's initial actions are just an outward expression of the misery all of Scotland is feeling. They're Mad as Hell and their not going to take it any more. And while the pen may be mightier than the sword, in 13th Century England the sword was the only means some people had. Scotland needed the courage and will to stand up and fight. Wallace gave them that.Mel Gibson is at the forefront of Braveheart. He starred in and directed this picture. While he was rewarded by the Academy with Best Picture and Best Director Oscars, his acting role as William Wallace cannot be overlooked. Braveheart is, after all, the story of William Wallace.

How could someone not love this movie?.Best way to describe this movie is The Great Escape with chickens. It sounds silly and of course the movie also is just that. It perfectly and amusingly spoofs classic prison camp movies, most notably of course The Great Escape and Stalag 17. Yet the movie knows to become more than just a spoof and it creates its own identity, with its own humor and other strong points.The biggest power of the movie is that is intendedly ridiculously made made, with silly looking characters and lets face it, also a silly story but everything is yet made very seriously. The contrast of that makes this movie work out very amusing, hilarious and also most definitely exciting. The two big action sequences form the highlights of the movie. It are sequences any other normal serious action would be jealous of.The movie is really great looking. This was the movie that introduced claymation to the main stream audience. Quite amazing once you start thinking about how this movie is made, purely with the use of clay and stop motion effects. This movie definitely raised the bar for future claymation projects. The characters are fun animated and look really over-the-top. The look gives every characters its very own identity and personality.The characters are all great ones. Especially the villainous and human characters of the movie Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy are great. Mrs. Tweedy is an excellent deliciously over-the-top and stereotypical movie villain, perfectly voiced by Miranda Richardson. Also all of the chickens are highly amusing and originally brought to the screen, with Mel Gibson and Julia Sawalha as the voices of the two main characters.The humor is fun and understandable for kids but especially great for the adults. It's the subtitle of all of the humor that really makes this movie such an hilarious one. So yes, I can recommend this movie to the kids but I can perhaps even recommend it more to the adults who perhaps even more shall enjoy watching this movie. This movie is irresistible to watch for everyone.The story is kept simple so it always remain understandable and the movie easy and pleasant to follow. It all is done in a good quick pace with some nimble editing and good camera-work.The musical score from Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell, who already did some great work together on the other animated movie from DreamWorks Antz, is just brilliant.

Because of this, I was very surprised to see it ranked so high in the IMDb Top 250! Now I am not saying this is a bad film and there are certainly worse films among the exalted few on the list. However, I am pointing out that I feel it is a tad overrated just so viewers don't have expectations that are a bit too high for the film. Of course, it is also possible the film IS that great and I just didn't appreciate it.The film starts with the conviction of a Nazi spy in an American court. His daughter is Ingrid Bergman and in response to all the notoriety from the case, she is leading a life that is sure to kill her sooner or later. What many do NOT realize is that her home has been bugged and our government knows she is not pro-Nazi. So, because her reputation has been ruined by good old dad, she is an excellent candidate to infiltrate a group in Brazil that MIGHT be a group of Nazis hoping to create a new Reich.Unfortunately, the American agent who recruits her is the ever so studly Cary Grant and they naturally fall in love. But, because she needs to infiltrate and even marry someone within this secret group, Grant later responds to Ingrid Bergman with cold indifference--even though it was obvious to everyone they had fallen in love. It's a great example of duty and patriotism superseding everything else.During the infiltration of the Neo-Nazi group, there is a lot of suspense but it is all done in a very restrained way. You know that she is in danger but it is subtle and difficult to detect. Because of these qualities, the film does an excellent job of building tension and involving the viewer.As far as negatives go, the only one (and boy is it minor) is that once again they cast Cary as an American even though he has a lovely English accent.

Because of this, I was very surprised to see it ranked so high in the IMDb Top 250! Now I am not saying this is a bad film and there are certainly worse films among the exalted few on the list. However, I am pointing out that I feel it is a tad overrated just so viewers don't have expectations that are a bit too high for the film. Of course, it is also possible the film IS that great and I just didn't appreciate it.The film starts with the conviction of a Nazi spy in an American court. His daughter is Ingrid Bergman and in response to all the notoriety from the case, she is leading a life that is sure to kill her sooner or later. What many do NOT realize is that her home has been bugged and our government knows she is not pro-Nazi. So, because her reputation has been ruined by good old dad, she is an excellent candidate to infiltrate a group in Brazil that MIGHT be a group of Nazis hoping to create a new Reich.Unfortunately, the American agent who recruits her is the ever so studly Cary Grant and they naturally fall in love. But, because she needs to infiltrate and even marry someone within this secret group, Grant later responds to Ingrid Bergman with cold indifference--even though it was obvious to everyone they had fallen in love. It's a great example of duty and patriotism superseding everything else.During the infiltration of the Neo-Nazi group, there is a lot of suspense but it is all done in a very restrained way. You know that she is in danger but it is subtle and difficult to detect. Because of these qualities, the film does an excellent job of building tension and involving the viewer.As far as negatives go, the only one (and boy is it minor) is that once again they cast Cary as an American even though he has a lovely English accent.

I don't think I agree. Why should a courageous and even heroic man be made to look like Michelangelo's sculpture of Moses? Weren't there ever any SHORT heroes? As far as I can discern, from what little grasp of historical events I have, the general outline of the plot sticks pretty close to the facts. I don't know that Frederick Douglass was still as prominent in 1863 as he had been earlier. Maybe he was. As the events unfold, though, they ring fairly true. The narration by Broderick is lifted directly from Shaw's letters to his family and they reveal a self-doubt, a contrarian conviction, a dignity, an objectivity, and a humility that all the rest of us must envy. His role in the film is similar to that of Liam Neeson's in Schindler's List or Richard Harris's in A Man Called Horse or Kevin Costner's in Dances With Wolves. He is our liaison to them. Shaw was educated, white, and socially prominent so we get to know a lot about him and the milieu in which he was raised. The Colored Troops, as they were called at the time, are only sketched in by the writers, and only sketchily sketched. There is the angry ex-slave, the wise old man, the good-natured but dumb squirrel shooter, and the poetry-reading New Englander who gets the crap beaten out of him by a racist Mick Sergeant -- for a lofty cause, naturally, as all sadistic drill sergeants are quick to point out. They look a little too much like the crew of the original Memphis Belle. If they were white, there would be a street-wise tough guy from Brooklyn and a braggart farm boy from Texas. The stereotypes are functional, though. Most stereotypes are.The structure shows us that not all blacks were the same. Nor were all Northern whites the same. Cliff DeYoung is a Jayhawker, an ex-slave owner, now an abolitionist, who believes his men must be treated like children. There was a lot of that going around. Darwinism was still a radical idea, less than ten years old. Nobody had the slightest idea of how humans had evolved and in the absence of DNA and other biological evidence of racial relationships, judgments were made on the basis of traits that have been shown to be superficial -- hair texture, skin color, the shape of the soft parts of the face. African-Americans were easy targets for displaced aggression just because they looked so different and there were so many of them around. Irishmen stepping off the boats were faced with being drafted into what was thought (wrongly) to be a rich man's war and a poor man's fight. The draft riots of New York City killed more than a hundred people, most of them black, including some in an orphanage.There were some monumental historical dynamics at work at the time, but no space to go into them, and they're most irrelevant to the movie anyway. (May I suggest reading Bruce Catton's books on the Civil War? Or MacPherson's Pulitzer-Prize-winning The Battle Cry of Freedom?) Broderick does pretty well by his role. He toughens up as he goes along. Cary Elwes looks handsome and acts as a humanistic counterbalance. Among the troops, Morgan Freeman is excellent, as usual, though his part doesn't offer him that much to do. What a fine actor he is. And Andre Braugher as the educated New Englander who is a poor soldier is outstanding as well. Denzel Washington was adequate without bringing much else to the party. The score is so bloated with glory that it really belongs to some epic about The Second Coming.Perhaps the scene I found most amusing involved Braugher and the rest debarking in South Carolina and bumping into some local ex-slaves. Braugher is unable to understand them because they're speaking in Gullah dialect, in which a buckra man is a boss or, by extension, any white person. The most disturbing scene involved my watching this in a theater in which the audience was largely black and being almost deafened by screams of exhortation as the Colored Troops shot and bayoneted whites.

They promise each other that they will not be like their cheating spouses, but as they spend more time with each other they felt more drawn and comfortable with the other as time passes.The literal use of absent spouses (never seeing their faces, hardly seeing their presence) is a very good and surprisingly original way of representing the loneliness these characters face.

I thought he was hilarious. His fight sequences were no where near as believable as Connerys were but I felt he portrayed Bond with a bit more elegance and class. Aside from the deplorable The Man With the Golden Gun, and the overly comical Moonraker, I found his other five films to be highly entertaining. Even Connery had his poor outings with Diamonds are Forever and Never Say Never Again. The Spy Who Loved me is an excellent James Bond film. To me it feels like the first in the series to resemble a modern day action movie. It doesn't have the yucky grainy 16mm look like the previous Bond films from the 70s. The special effects are superb, the villains underwater fortress looks very realistic and 007's Lotus in my opinion is a much cooler car than the Aston Martin from Goldfinger.I also liked the Jaws character. I thought they could have done without his return in Moonraker, but they could have done without a lot of things in that one.For a fun 007 experience check this one out. Its easily one of the top five and the second best by Moore. I think Octopussy is slightly better but many will strongly disagree with that statement.

Of those three, this is the most powerful, compelling, interesting to watch, and most beautiful. T2 is a great sci-fi story about how people can change the future for the better. A line from the movie sums up the theme no fate but what we make for ourselves. Cameron is also quite brilliant by taking showing character development in an android, showing its transformation from cold killer to empathetic being. This sympathetic portrayal of a robot with a soul is more compelling than another movies that attempt a similar plot, Blade Runner. The acting is actually very good by all of the major players. Eddie Furlong does a superb job as a teenage John Connor. He is a three-dimensional character bratty, yet with a strong moral sense and a realization of how human actions can alter the course of future events. Arnold Schwarzenneger needs only be cold and emotionless as the cybernetic killer, and he does very well here. His only need to have emotion at the end, when his character learns compassion. Linda Hamilton is excellent as an action star, and it's a shame she hasn't starred in more movies. Robert Patrick shines as the coldly evil T-1000, one of sci-fi's best villains. He is excellent as an emotionless Terminator, and he can send chills down the spine of viewers of all ages.The violence is not as extreme as other sci-fi movies, like the aforementioned Aliens franchise or Robocop, but there is enough action and suspense to please any action fan. This movie was one of the most expensive to produce at the time it was made, but it was money well spent. This movie is such a classic that it almost redeems Cameron for the sappy Titanic. Watch T2!

Chong isn't going to stay and live off his mom and dad anymore...-because he can't, they have kicked him out after him defying every last job offer they have made to him. And as far as Pedro is concerned he's just a hard working' guy living with relatives sleeping on the couch. But again, now Pedro is the Man with that 'heavy' Chevy impala with custom etching on the side window, just behind his head. And they could cruise all day Tom, that is if they aren't parked on the side of the road, wasted and small-eyed laughing at each-others wacky antics. All in everything, these two may make it yet, with a little help from the last whole brain cell. that together they possess. This is off the wall and crazed fun, one of the funniest I've ever seen... They have a 'crack' team of officers following and surveying them. Follow the freak, the freak with the basketball. Which basketball?? And let's face another fact, the cops have just not been this fun in a long time.Recommended for comedic pleasure, of the far-out, tune in mellow out then laugh, till you gag, then get the munchies and do it all over kind of time.

Their off and running, my two favorite stoner's, Pedro and the man, on the first and most fun of their adventures together. For the reference sake, these two should and probably did 'Win' awards for this full firing token express moving toward 'band' greatness! Getting ready for F.M. radio and plenty of women!!! But first they got to make it over to Strawberry's place, so they can score some mean smoke, man. Strawberry (Tom Skarrett ) was a strange dude himself, you know? He just needed to be a little more mellow, for sure. But the real up-tight dude was that policeman guy, Sgt. Stedankko. His brave crew of ' rookies ' by his side looking and looking all over for those out landish dope fiend's. They hardly work and when they do it's almost disastrous! But at least they are good at their jobs, getting' high, by the wayside. Tommy Chong and Cheech Marin made everyone enjoy the hippie and Mexican experience.

It is based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks. There are two major actors and actresses. Jamie Sullivan, who is played by Mandy Moore, is an outsider, who has Leukemia. Landon Carter, played by Shane West, isn't too friendly towards her. He is one of the most popular kids in High School and is also constantly in trouble. Landon's careless attitude leads him towards the path of Jamie. Faith brings these two people together to save each others lives. This movie is so touching; it will make an impact in your life along with changing your view of life. Is there a movie you want to see that is unique and touching? Go and rent the movie, A Walk to Remember. This is an excellent movie to recommend to anyone. In this movie a viewer will notice the outstanding performances of the actors and actress, the cinematography and the music. The acting in this movie is magnificent. Everyone in this film finds a way to touch the viewer's heart. Shane West starts out as a schmuck then transforms to a gentleman, and does it perfectly. Furthermore, he pulls off the double life between his friends and Jamie and him. When Landon's two worlds clashes, he stays with Jamie leaving his friends to back stab him. Mandy Moore does not lead on that her character has cancer. Jamie is an outsider but she doesn't fit into the same crowd as Landon and prefers to spend her time enhancing the lives of others instead of partying. Also, she lived everyday to the fullest. Being alone does not bother her.The cinematography in this movie is phenomenal. Before faith brings Jamie and Landon together, Jamie is always wearing pale colors. Half way through the movie, Jamie wears a bluish grayish sweater until Landon buys her a pink sweater. There is a warm and lovely look to the small town of Beauport, North Carolina. The images are never lacking in sharpness. In this movie there are exterior and interior scenes. The exterior scenes look thoroughly gorgeous and really give the viewer the sense that they are right in the middle of the action. The interior scenes seem softer. It appears that Jamie looks paler then rest of the cast. When each scene ends, it will fade through the back to start the new shot, making it look like a black screen.The sound track was excellent. At the beginning of the movie, the music is very suspenseful. Immediately, the viewer knows something is going on. Each dramatic scene starts with up-beat music. For instance, Monday morning at school exciting music and it is catchy. Some of the music matches marvelously with the scenes. In the shot of Jamie talking to Landon on the bus, the music comes to make sense later on. Once that song gets louder the viewer hears all the things you try to do, throwing your life away is hinting towards how Landon is living his life. The most touching and unforgettable music came at the end. It just added to the sorrow of the scene. In addition, the music does not overpower the movie. Adam Shankman used the right amount of music.In conclusion, this movie is worth watching. Shane West's and Mandy Moore's performances were exquisite. Meanwhile at the same time, the cinematography was beyond compare. Alongside with that the music added to it. None of these were lacking in any means. This movie will be an instant favorite for romantically hopeless people.
