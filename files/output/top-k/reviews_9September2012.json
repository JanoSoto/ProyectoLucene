Poor quality, poor dialogue, poor production quality, etc. It all seemed to be a set-up for what would surely be a poor movie. Boy, was I wrong. Once the movie got going, it didn't stop. I watched it on NetFlix and kept pausing the movie to check Facebook and relax because it made me so tense. It is one of the best horror movies I've seen in years. The twist ending was flawless, just perfect. I can't say enough good things about this movie. Clearly, to me, the only drawback was the slow start of the movie, which really came off like a bad Lifetime movie except everything was even more depressing and dreary...if that's even possible. The movie gives just enough detail about what's going on and what could be happening, but not enough to completely give away the ending. It's just the right movie to get your significant other clinging onto you until you have to pry them off. Clearly, first impressions aren't everything, and I think anyone looking forward to being worried about what might happen to you when you walk across the room to turn the light back on will enjoy this movie.

In 1986 James Cameron dished out a sequel that went a completely different direction from the first one, but was amazingly just as phenomenal, when he made Aliens. And then in 1992 David Fincher, in his very first feature film, gave us Alien 3. Poorly received, initially, this third installment in the saga continues the story of Ripley when her escape pod that her, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop escaped in at the end of Aliens crash lands on an all male prison planet. Ripley is the only survivor of the crash...or so she thinks. Soon enough the horrible xenomorph shows its face again and Ripley once again has to fight for her live while protecting those less experienced in fighting these horrible creatures.Now, a quick disclaimer. The version of Alien 3 I watched was the aptly named Assembly Cut of the film. Alien 3 was stuck in development hell for a very long time, going through a plethora of rewrites and directors. David Fincher signed on and construction began on sets before the script was even finished. Then the script changed drastically and the tons of things had to be reworked and the film was constantly changing. When everything was finally laid out Fincher put together his first cut of the film, which was two and a half hours long, and turned it into 20th Century Fox. The studio was not pleased with it and changed the film significantly. The final product that the studio released was about a half hour shorter with a totally different beginning and end. Fincher despised the reworking of his film and has since disowned this film entirely. But in 2003 when the Alien Quadirlogy box set was released on DVD Fincher's preferred Assembly Cut was included. This is the version I watched.The reason I went into so much detail is because the theatrical release of the film was very poorly received. However, the Assembly Cut that I watched was awesome. It's a truly excellent film and an awesome addition to the series. It hearkens back more to the first film, only featuring one xenomorph and focusing more on claustrophobic terror than the guns blazing action film that was Aliens. Not that Aliens didn't work unbelievably well, but I loved that Alien 3 shifted back to the suspense\/horror roots of the series. Of course, this film is not as good as either of its predecessors, but still a fantastic film in its own rights.Alien 3 flows wonderfully, the characters are a lot of fun and they are very fresh archetypes in the series. The setting of the film, again, hearkens back to the setting of the first film, but now with some new and very interesting elements that you have to experience for yourself. Alien 3 is riveting and enthralling from start to finish, with Sigourney Weaver giving it her all as Ripley once again. It has its small flaws here and there, but they are far from fatal. There are some minor plot holes, the script isn't the best in the world, and the CGI is actually pretty bad at times, somewhat removing you from the experience.But, as a whole, this really is an invigorating film where you never know what will happen next. It's a film that just keeps on giving and keeps on impressing in the goriest and most exciting ways possible. You would be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't watch Alien 3. It's not nearly as good as Alien or Aliens, but that is only because those two films are masterpieces.

The film follows his rise up through the ranks thanks in large part to the controversy that followed him due to the nature of his act. I've always felt that LENNY was one of the best movies of the decade and even after all these years it's still a very sharp, at times funny but mostly sad look at a man who deserved much better than he ever got. There's no doubt in my mind that the film was like the light shining from above on both Fosse and Hoffman as the two were perfectly meant to bring this film to the screen and boy do they really deliver. Fosse's style here wouldn't work with most directors but the way he uses it to get to the emotion and power in the story is quite amazing.

This is an awful B-movie that somehow got a 35 million approved big budget instead of a 2 or a 5 million budget, which is what it looks like. That may not sound like a lot but they weren't spending 100-200 million on films back when this was made. I knew people who worked on it and heard it was a train wreck and that Courtney Solomon had no idea how to make a movie, especially when it came to effects, and was pissing money into the wind, which is why you don't see any of the money in the film. In fact all you can gather from watching this film is that Courtney embezzled the money he was given or he is the biggest idiot on the planet who tried to act like a big shot and like he did know what he was doing and squandered it all on his mistakes. The only reason he got to make a movie is because he owned the rights to the name Dungeons & Dragons and someone was stupid enough to give someone with no experience a decent budget. It says the movie cost 45 million but I remember reading it in the papers and he was given 35. Either 45 is incorrect or they had to spend an extra 10 million to finish the film. Everything about this film was awful. It wasn't even like a story. It was liking watching a D&D game being played in real life, which maybe D&D gamers would enjoy that...maybe, but no one else would. Justin Whalin is the worst casting for this role and this movie pretty much killed his career. He was pretty big and well known in the '90s and you never heard a peep out of him after this awful film. He is too small and just does not look like a heroic action guy at all. The effects in this film are terrible. They look like really bad video game effects. And you can tell they are short on money because they use this same shot twice where the camera sweeps and circles around a computer generated tower. It was probably the most expensive shot in the film so they felt compelled to use it twice. They have a scene where you know they ran out of money because the actors talk about the creature that is in the distance, that looks like a speck on screen. The actors are describing it, rather than showing it, because it's clear Courtney had blown all his money at this point. Only a total idiot makes an animation company show completed animation BEFORE he gives approval. That's what pre-viz and the design team is for. It's no wonder the only thing he's worked on since then are cruddy, low budget B-movies. ","genre":null},{"date":"9 September 2012","score":"","review":" Maybe even in my top 5.

It looks like it have come straight from the 70's. The hairstyles , the music , the clothes... Even Stallone reminds me of Al Pacino's Serpico. Don't get me wrong. I don't have anything against the 70's . I just miss the taste of 80's movie here. When I'm watching a movie from the 80's , I simply wanna feel the 80's style . Oh well.Nighthawks is kinda forgotten movie in Stallone's career. Unrightfully. It's a solid thriller and it's a shame that Stallone didn't attempt to make more movies like this in the 80's. I've enjoyed Rambo and Rocky sequels , but I think he should try his luck in thrillers too.The screenplay is good , but for a large part of the movie doesn't know what to do with DaSilva (Stallone). So , while the villain (Rutger Hauer is good as always in this type of role) is making next moves , the hero is sitting and learning about his modus operandi. Stallone is frustrated and so is the audience. I know this is important aspect of the story , but it could have been done much better.Thankfully , after the training part is done the movie starts to be really interesting. The chase scene is wonderful. The tension between Hauer and Stallone is good and the final of the movie is quite memorable. Billy Dee Williams (Empire strikes back) is OK as Stallone's friend.Director of this movie Bruce Malmuth had pleasure to work with 3 action stars  Sylvester Stallone , Steven Seagal (Hard to kill) and Dolph Lundgren (Pentathlon). This is definitely his best movie.One year later after this movie was done Rutger Hauer gave his iconic performance in Blade Runner . Stallone became Rambo and made third Rocky movie .

I haven't read the book , so I don't know how much this movie is faithful to the book or is the book better\/worse than movie. Opinions differ. Gregory Macdonald after seeing the movie was pleased and complimented both director Michael Ritchie and Chevy Chase. I know that I really liked the movie , so in the future I'm going to buy the book . That tells you something about the quality of the movie.Hollywood was trying for many years to do a movie about Fletch , but couldn't for some unknown reason. I believe the success of Eddie Murphy's Beverly Hills Cop (one of my favourite movies) was the main reason why Fletch was finally made. It was a green light for the movie,I believe. There's only one year of difference between them , so the timing couldn't be more right. Also , Chevy Chase (the main star) was at peek of his career with Caddyshack and National lampoons Vacation - two commercially successful movies that are classics today.Other similarities to the mentioned Beverly Hills Cop include catchy music by Harold Faltermeyer ( the same guy who did music for BHC. The Fletch theme is just as good as Axel F ), nice little detective story ( why rich man wants to die ?) and overall cheerful mood . Fletch doesn't have such strong soundtrack as BHC , but the opening and ending credits Stephanie Mills song  Bit by bit is great , and really helps to set the mood. I'm not saying that Fletch is a rip-off , I just want to recommend this movie to everyone who liked Eddie's movie and is looking for something similar. I love them both.Chevy Chase is great as Fletch. His finest performance will forever be that of Clark Griswald , but I can't imagine any other actor who would fill the role better. Chase feels very natural here . He even improvised in few scenes with good effect ( the Moonriver scene ). Irwin Fletch Fletcher is a lovely character. Narcissistic , overconfident , master of disguise , playboy and journalist. He isn't very strong , but when he gets into trouble you can be sure he will be okay. His brain and mouth are his weapons.The rest of the cast gives solid performances , especially Joe Don Baker and Dana Wheeler Nicholson.
