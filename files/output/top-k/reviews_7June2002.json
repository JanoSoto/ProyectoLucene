Then there's the plot which is non-existent maybe it was so rushed i didn't notice it or maybe i was paying too much attention to Milla Jovovich (reason in its self to see the movie ).

In the vain of movies such as &#145;There's something about Mary' and &#145;Austin Powers', comes this hilarious comedy about a Woman who changes the lives of three men. I have not laughed so hard like that in alongtime. As current man on the singles list, I am keeping a watchful eye out for a girl to date. I hope I don't run into someone like Jewel, because I am sure I could not handle her!She is one hot lady. And after just one night at McCool's, she is the only three unsuspecting men can think about. There's the bartender who was working that night. The lawyer who stayed past closing time. Then there is the cop who showed up to investigate the crime scene. Did we forget to mention the crime? Three men all lusting after one sexy woman &#150; it's going to be nothing but trouble after this night at McCool's.This is one of the funniest and smartest movies I have seen in alongtime. The script this movie had was incredible. I enjoyed how all three stories are first told to the audience, then are brought together in a climatic ending. It had an original feel to it, with I'm sure many little touched add in on set. The director of One Night At McCool's was Norwegian Harald  Zwart, who must have very funny sense of humour and imaginative mind, because I really enjoyed what he did with this film. But the standout part of this movie was the cast that it contained. The star of the show was Hollywood beau Liv Tyler. She suited the role of &#145;Jewel' perfectly. I love how in almost every scene Jewel hypnotize the men that are lusting after her. It was a big part of this movie, as it is an important part of the movie. I am glad that Liv Tyler got the nod to play jewel, as she plays one woman who is basically many women and did that just right.Yet this film contained some very famous male actors including Hollywood legend Michael Douglas. His role, while it was not the biggest or the most important to this film, it had a big impact on me. His onscreen presence is big for me. By the way, his hairstyle for this movie is &#145;unforgettable'. Then you have the very unlucky Randy, played by veteran actor Matt Dillon. His role in this is not so unlike that in There's something about  Mary. He was great as Randy. I found that he plays the unlucky sucker pretty well. His other standout movies include Wild Things and There's something about Mary, where he is hilarious once again. Yet the other guys thrown into this weird love triangle are also very good. Paul Reiser, from the TV show &#145;Mad About You', was Randy's cousin, Carl, who witnesses all the events between Randy and Jewel. Paul was a funny addition to the cast, with the finale to the film, a cracker. John Goodman, is a comedy genius, with his big frame and chubby face, he is a likable character in almost any sort of film. His role in McCool's is no exception. It is funny how we see him retreat to a priest to get help for his infatuation over Jewel. Goodman is a veteran of the big and small screen, with his great success in the TV hit Roseanne and in movies like The Flintstones, Blues Brothers, and  the 2000 hit movie `Coyote Ugly'.  This film has many funny scenes, with the main stars always seemingly being involved in something that could get them in big trouble, or bring them great &#145;love'! The scene where Jewel firsts meets Randy is very funny, as you are unsure of what both parties are getting into, also the scene where Carl invites Randy and Jewel over for a BBQ is also amusing. Throw in a silly but well thought Village people dance mix at the end makes this very appealing to comedy fans anywhere. To wrap up on One night at McCool's, I want to say that this film shows how silly men act when there is a woman in their life. I am struggling in that area of my life right now, but I do not want to go through what these men had to endure, as it is a real death wish what Jewel puts them through. This film also makes weary of not trusting the first person I see or who sees me, because that is one of the worst ways of being hurt, which I know what is like. Men and women are so alike, they are like the metaphor of a book, that what is on the inside is not always like the outside.

Bandits starts out as a slick action-comedy and evolves into a sweet romantic comedy.  When I found out Barry Levinson was the director, I assumed the film would be at least halfway decent.  Levinson has a keen eye for character development, and that's one of the things that interested me.  Normally, a film like this would be consisted of cut-and-dry, stereotypical characters, but we gradually fall in love these three characters.  After reading the rave reviews (Joel Siegel voted this as one of the best films of the year), despite poor box office numbers, I had high expectations for this film--higher than they were after watching the trailer.  For some reason, this just doesn't look like a film that would receive 4-star reviews.  Now that I have seen it, I can't regard it as a 4-star film, but it's good and entertaining and I wasn't disappointed. Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton make a great team--they really have an impeccable chemistry.  I hope to see them teamed up again in the future.  They have the potential to be the next Martin and Lewis.  Billy Bob especially steals the film, playing a neurotic Woody Allen-type.  He is absolutely hilarious!  Bruce flashes his trademark grin and speaks in his usual soft tone, but his role doesn't exactly require the talents of Pacino or DeNiro.  Still, Bruce is entertaining and his constant banter with Billy Bob makes the experience even more entertaining.  And last but not least, I will mention Cate Blanchett, who gives another incredible performance.  I was lucky enough to rent 2 Cate Blanchett movies--this film and The Gift--by coincidence.  I got to see her sweet, charming performance in Bandits as well as her powerful dramatic performance in The Gift.  Just watching those 2 films, gives me a great idea of her scope as an actress.  It's sometimes hard to believe she's an Australian actress.  How she pulls off such an impeccable American accent--I don't know.  I think if I were to hear her speak in an Australian accent, I'd think she's feigning it.  Well, Blanchett perfectly completes the trio of actors, and has a great chemistry with the 2 male leads.  And it's great to see that Willis, Thornton and Blanchett all seem like they're having fun.  When first watching this movie, I found some of the bank robberies--though very slick and original--to be quite implausible.  If the film wasn't as charming and likable, I'd probably have a difficult time suspending disbelief.  But then I found out the story of the Sleepover Bandits was actually based on a real duo of bank robbers.  Of course, this is nowhere close to a biopic and most of the story is obviously fiction, the concept of these two guys sleeping over the bank managers' houses and robbing their banks the next morning was based on truth.  Why these managers didn't call the cops while the two guys weren't watching or why they didn't try to strangle the two guys in their sleep--I don't know.  The truth really is stranger than fiction.  But the bandits did have an interesting gimmick  they only robbed banks, since the money belonged to the government; they never snatched money from people's pockets.  There's actually a scene in the movie in which they bust out of prison and rob a lady's car.  Willis hands the lady her pocketbook and says, Don't forget your pocketbook.  The film evolves into a romantic comedy during the second half.  I guess that's why audiences were disappointed--they probably expected a sheer action-comedy\/crime caper and not a romantic comedy.  But I think the fact that the screenwriter and Levinson stretched this out into a romantic comedy made it all the more better.  It added new dimensions, and helped us better fall in love with these amiable characters.  It was fun watching the strong and macho Willis vie lanky pushover Thornton over the love of alluring Blanchett.  It creates an interesting conflict, and spawns some very funny scenes.  The film concludes, picking up from where it left off in the beginning--which is the two bandits pulling off their last bank robbery.  The twist ending is nifty and unpredictable, and left me satisfied.  Though this is basically a feel-good comedy that kept me smiling, there's no cheap schmaltz or trashy sentiment.

Bandits starts out as a slick action-comedy and evolves into a sweet romantic comedy.  When I found out Barry Levinson was the director, I assumed the film would be at least halfway decent.  Levinson has a keen eye for character development, and that's one of the things that interested me.  Normally, a film like this would be consisted of cut-and-dry, stereotypical characters, but we gradually fall in love these three characters.  After reading the rave reviews (Joel Siegel voted this as one of the best films of the year), despite poor box office numbers, I had high expectations for this film--higher than they were after watching the trailer.  For some reason, this just doesn't look like a film that would receive 4-star reviews.  Now that I have seen it, I can't regard it as a 4-star film, but it's good and entertaining and I wasn't disappointed. Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton make a great team--they really have an impeccable chemistry.  I hope to see them teamed up again in the future.  They have the potential to be the next Martin and Lewis.  Billy Bob especially steals the film, playing a neurotic Woody Allen-type.  He is absolutely hilarious!  Bruce flashes his trademark grin and speaks in his usual soft tone, but his role doesn't exactly require the talents of Pacino or DeNiro.  Still, Bruce is entertaining and his constant banter with Billy Bob makes the experience even more entertaining.  And last but not least, I will mention Cate Blanchett, who gives another incredible performance.  I was lucky enough to rent 2 Cate Blanchett movies--this film and The Gift--by coincidence.  I got to see her sweet, charming performance in Bandits as well as her powerful dramatic performance in The Gift.  Just watching those 2 films, gives me a great idea of her scope as an actress.  It's sometimes hard to believe she's an Australian actress.  How she pulls off such an impeccable American accent--I don't know.  I think if I were to hear her speak in an Australian accent, I'd think she's feigning it.  Well, Blanchett perfectly completes the trio of actors, and has a great chemistry with the 2 male leads.  And it's great to see that Willis, Thornton and Blanchett all seem like they're having fun.  When first watching this movie, I found some of the bank robberies--though very slick and original--to be quite implausible.  If the film wasn't as charming and likable, I'd probably have a difficult time suspending disbelief.  But then I found out the story of the Sleepover Bandits was actually based on a real duo of bank robbers.  Of course, this is nowhere close to a biopic and most of the story is obviously fiction, the concept of these two guys sleeping over the bank managers' houses and robbing their banks the next morning was based on truth.  Why these managers didn't call the cops while the two guys weren't watching or why they didn't try to strangle the two guys in their sleep--I don't know.  The truth really is stranger than fiction.  But the bandits did have an interesting gimmick  they only robbed banks, since the money belonged to the government; they never snatched money from people's pockets.  There's actually a scene in the movie in which they bust out of prison and rob a lady's car.  Willis hands the lady her pocketbook and says, Don't forget your pocketbook.  The film evolves into a romantic comedy during the second half.  I guess that's why audiences were disappointed--they probably expected a sheer action-comedy\/crime caper and not a romantic comedy.  But I think the fact that the screenwriter and Levinson stretched this out into a romantic comedy made it all the more better.  It added new dimensions, and helped us better fall in love with these amiable characters.  It was fun watching the strong and macho Willis vie lanky pushover Thornton over the love of alluring Blanchett.  It creates an interesting conflict, and spawns some very funny scenes.  The film concludes, picking up from where it left off in the beginning--which is the two bandits pulling off their last bank robbery.  The twist ending is nifty and unpredictable, and left me satisfied.  Though this is basically a feel-good comedy that kept me smiling, there's no cheap schmaltz or trashy sentiment.

This is a great example of the ruin it with pointless sequels theory. The first two Alien films are brilliant. They are truly scary, feature great characters portrayed by great actors in a well thought out, well executed story. The third one began to slide towards silly, but Resurrection was down right slap in the face to all who loved the series. First problem Sigourney Weaver. While the name of the character is Ripley, lets face it, that ain't Ellen Ripley. She has none of the insurmountable determination coupled with sickening compassion that she featured in the fist three installments. Instead, she is some sly, ultra tough comic-book villain in a lead role. Second problem too much pointless gore. The scene where Dan Hedaya reaches around and pulls a piece of brain out of his open skull was waaaay over the top. I mean, the chest busting scenes of the first few were shocking, and that set the tone for the shocks to follow, but the brain scene was simply gratuitous. Another scene is where the science experiment guy is about to have a chest buster emerge from himself. What does he do? Runs around like a circus clown until he can grab a bad guy from behind, and has the chest buster exit him, and enter the back of the bad guy, essentially, taking the bad guy with him. Stupidest death ever. Third thing wrong with the film The director is taking a hard advantage of the fact that everyone knows what the alien looks like. Take a look at the aliens of the first three movies. We never really get a good hard look at them before they leap out of the shot or the camera cuts away. That helps create the suspense of Oh my god, what is that thing??. But when you get a full body shot of the aliens over a period of 15-30 seconds, suddenly, they just don't seen very scary anymore. Final thing wrong the whole stupid plot. While I did find certain scenes to be interesting, a few scenes can't save a stupid movie. Why was it set in an even more distant future? Wasn't the distant future of the first three distant enough? Obviously not. What happened to all those intriguing characters at the end of the third movie? The lone surviving prisoner, the Bishop creator? Those were great characters, and the possibility of a further conspiracy through the company was completely ignored. And of course Winona Rider as the hidden android. She was a subtle a a baseball bat to the face. Terrible casting there. Overall, I highly recommend the first two, see the third movie if you are curious, but I can only recommend Resurrection if you want to see how Hollywood can poop all over a great series.

The third one began to slide towards silly, but Resurrection was down right slap in the face to all who loved the series. First problem Sigourney Weaver. While the name of the character is Ripley, lets face it, that ain't Ellen Ripley. She has none of the insurmountable determination coupled with sickening compassion that she featured in the fist three installments. Instead, she is some sly, ultra tough comic-book villain in a lead role. Second problem too much pointless gore. The scene where Dan Hedaya reaches around and pulls a piece of brain out of his open skull was waaaay over the top. I mean, the chest busting scenes of the first few were shocking, and that set the tone for the shocks to follow, but the brain scene was simply gratuitous. Another scene is where the science experiment guy is about to have a chest buster emerge from himself. What does he do? Runs around like a circus clown until he can grab a bad guy from behind, and has the chest buster exit him, and enter the back of the bad guy, essentially, taking the bad guy with him. Stupidest death ever. Third thing wrong with the film The director is taking a hard advantage of the fact that everyone knows what the alien looks like. Take a look at the aliens of the first three movies. We never really get a good hard look at them before they leap out of the shot or the camera cuts away. That helps create the suspense of Oh my god, what is that thing??. But when you get a full body shot of the aliens over a period of 15-30 seconds, suddenly, they just don't seen very scary anymore. Final thing wrong the whole stupid plot. While I did find certain scenes to be interesting, a few scenes can't save a stupid movie. Why was it set in an even more distant future? Wasn't the distant future of the first three distant enough? Obviously not. What happened to all those intriguing characters at the end of the third movie? The lone surviving prisoner, the Bishop creator? Those were great characters, and the possibility of a further conspiracy through the company was completely ignored. And of course Winona Rider as the hidden android. She was a subtle a a baseball bat to the face. Terrible casting there. Overall, I highly recommend the first two, see the third movie if you are curious, but I can only recommend Resurrection if you want to see how Hollywood can poop all over a great series.

I've really been looking forward to this movie, mostly because of Kingsley's acclaimed performance.  And he is indeed brilliant in the role of the brash, uninhibited, shamelessly ruthless Don Logan--a role that should go down in history.  I haven't seen Jim Broadbent's performance in Iris, so I can't technically say if Kingsley deserved the Oscar over him, but I'm glad he got nominated, because it would be an abomination if he didn't.  Kingsley is absolutely terrifying, not showing a bit of remorse.  And it's a real joy to see the man who's famous for playing the well-known pacifist Gandhi take on a role which requires him to spout the f word 500 times in one whole minute.  OK, I may have been exaggerating there, but believe me...there are scenes in this movie that make Pulp Fiction look like a G-rated Disney feature.  Let's just say I've never heard the f word used so many times, at such a lightning-fast pace.  Kingsley has some memorable moments, including one where he gets in trouble for smoking on a plane, and cops an alibi involving the male flight attendants sexually abusing him.  As cruel as he is, I found myself laughing hysterically at Don.  As Kingsley said himself, Don is the type of character who says the kind of things that are on most people's minds, but they're too afraid to let it out.    Though Kinglsey steals the film, Ray Winstone is the star and he's also great.  I haven't seen a great many English films, so I don't remember seeing him before, but now I hope to see him in more films.  And I was impressed to find out the movie was made by a first-time director.  Jonathan Glazer did a terrific job, creating a gloriously frenetic pace.  The running time is a succinct 85 minutes, and the film never takes a breath.  It always captures you with in-your-face images.  Glazer's sense of style is amazing.  Not to mention the soundtrack is excellent.  It's a nice irony  how this dark comedy ends to the tune of Dean Martin's Sway. On my first viewing, it took time for me to get accustomed to the cockney accents, but after approximately 30 minutes I was able to decipher most of the dialogue--and the film has some great, memorable dialogue!  It's not like with Lock, Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels where I can watch it 100 times and still need subtitles.  Not to mention Sexy Beast is a much more entertaining film.  All I can say is don't expect an intricate plot, with many twists and turns.  The plot is all pretty simple  Retired gangster lounges around his beautiful house in Spain, then gets persuaded into doing one last heist.  I'm sure that sounds very familiar.  But the beauty is in its simplicity.  And the film isn't in any way pretentious.  It is what it is--and what it is is a smart, energetic, entertaining, hilarious, extremely well-acted dark comedy.

The story of this film is loosely based on the story from the cartoon series.  I say loosely, because other than the names of some of the people (He-Man, Man-At-Arms, Teela, Skeletor, Beast Man) and the names of some of the places (Castle Grayskull, Snake Mountain, Eternia), the two stories don't seem to have a whole lot in common.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing, although, it was sad that some of the key\/favorite characters from the cartoon series didn't make it into the film.  It would have been cool to see Battle-Cat in the film, although very hard to execute.  I think a lot of people would have liked to see Orco too...but I never liked him much anyway, so that was just fine with me to cut him out.  As for the cast, I thought they were actually pretty good.  It seems most people disliked Dolph Lundgren playing He-Man, but I thought he was great!  No, he's not the best actor in the world, but I thought he did a fine job.  I really enjoyed seeing Courteney Cox in her early work, and at such a young age, she was quite the looker back then too.  As for Frank Langella (Skeletor), I thought he did a great job with the role!  And I thought his make-up was incredible!  Very good job!  I thought the rest of the cast did a great job too.  People that deserve a special mention is Bill Barty (Gwildor), James Tolkan (Det. Lubic) and Chelsea Field (Teela).  The only major complaint about the movie that I have is why did they have to kill off Sarod and not Karg?  Saurod was cool looking and Karg was just plain stupid.  He talked stupid, he looked stupid, his clothes were stupid...all around stupid!  Saurod was cool!  Anyway, in a strictly movie sense, this movie isn't really very good, and if you don't know anything about He-Man, then are almost sure to dislike it.  But in a nostalgic sort of way, the movie is pretty cool.  Also, you have to keep in mind that this IS a kid's movie, so it's not really intended to be anything really mind-blowing.

My reviews, as Gorehound-1, are there to give hints to gore fans, to help them in their choices for viewing or buying a gore movie. I advise you that I am a very strong stomach, and it's almost impossible to gross me out. My ratings are a mark between 0 and 10 for the gore (its quality and amount), the violence, the sadism, and the brutality.(Spoilers warning)Gore quality 10\/10 The gore is awesome.

So I did.It was really good, I definitely liked it.  Although, I think it should win some kind of award for WORST NAMED movie EVER!  Even though I'm a HUGE Reese fan, I've always avoided that movie, because I thought it was one of those made for tv movies where they somehow stretch out an eight car pile up into a 2 hour movie.Now the embarrassing part...but in all fairness to me, it was LATE and I was TIRED!When the movie first started, and they showed the titles over all the cartoons of sexpot red riding hoods being chased by big bad wolves, I thought to myself, These are the dumbest credits EVER.  UNFORTUNATELY, I did not realize the movie was a metaphor for the fairy tale, until the VERY end, when Reese walks into the trailer park and shouts Grandma, it's me, I'm here!.  Yes, I admit it.  I'm an idiot.  But I was VERY tired!!!!Did the fact that the cartoon titles say little red riding hood! tell me anything?  No.  Did the fact that she was going to visit her grandma tell me anything?  No.  Did the fact that she grabbed a wicker basket to put a few thing in it for her trip tell me anything?  No.  Did the fact that the psycho killers name was Bob Wolverton tell me anything?  NO!  Did the fact, that the REAL name of the guy that played Detective Mike Breer was Wolfgang Bodison tell me anything? N--well, THAT might have just been a coincidence.  Now the only part I DON'T feel bad about was the part that the fiance was named Chopper Wood, although HAD I realized the whole metaphor thing, I might have appreciated even that part a bit.ANYWAY, that's my embarrassing confession.Watch the movie, you'll enjoy it.
