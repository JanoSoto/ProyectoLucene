It's obviously a commentary on modern society, but it's also a look into one man's psyche. You will come to realize by the end of the film that everything you are seeing is through the almost certainly unreliable point of view of Patrick as he begins to come unhinged.I want to talk about the end of the film though, because I think it's what will upset viewers of this movie. Throughout the film for the most part, you accept that Patrick is a serial killer. After all, he tells you he is - he takes bloody sheets to the dry cleaner, stabs a homeless man, chops up his coworker. As viewers of films we've been trained to accept what we see as fact. But in the end actions become increasingly more absurd and unrealistic, culminating in a final scene where an ATM tells Bateman to feed it a stray cat, and he goes on a much too over the top shooting rampage. We cannot accept that what we are seeing is actually happening.I think this is what is so great, yet so annoying, about this movie. There is no catharsis, no resolution, no A Beautiful Mind moment where we or Bateman finally know for sure what's real and what's not. We're brought to the moment of climax but we don't get the resolution, so we're left feeling frustrated, so to speak. But that's what's so great about it too, because it forces you to think about it, consider it. Unlike so many Hollywood blockbusters that spoonfeed you tripe to gaze at blankly for an hour and a half, American Psycho engages your mind.The movie is flawed. It's hard for me to put my finger on it exactly, but it's a multitude of little things that alternately alienate and bore the audience, mixed in with many brilliant scenes. It's hard for me to say if this story could've been done better, never having read the novel, but it's hard to pull off this kind of subjective reality on film. But American Psycho is certainly worth watching. ","genre":null},{"date":"15 March 2011","score":"","review":" So much could be, and probably has been, said about this film.

It absolutely contains spoilers. If you haven't seen it yet, do it, and then please come back and read this, especially if you didn't like the movie.While it may not be the greatest movie ever made, it is certainly my personal favorite and is up there among the best with movies like Citizen Kane and Casablanca. One of the main criticisms I saw of this film was that it was too long. This is pathetic. 3 hours, in the great scheme of things, is really not that long. If you really want to give the film a chance, you can manage keeping your eyes open for that long. That being said, its length is necessary to manage the progression of the story. Think about it there is not one scene that can be removed from the film and have it keep its composure.This leads me to the second main criticism, that it is too long-winded, and as some people say, has no plot at all. This is simply false. The main crux of the story, for those who refused to look for it, is the development of Michael from a puppy-eyed guy who had a swell gal and hated his father's business to a cold-hearted, truly evil character who oversees half of the film's deaths in a matter of 20 minutes, movie time. Some claim that this transformation is not called for, and that it seems too sudden, but there is really a cause and effect. McCluskey punches him, he gets mad, realizes that he should kill Sollozzo and McCluskey, goes to Italy, comes back heartbroken after the murders of Appollonia and Sonny, and finally snaps when Vito passes. Of course, this leads to his rise as Don Corleone, giving him the power to execute Barzini, Tattaglia, Cuneo, Zaluchi, and Moe Greene. It's actually very well thought out.Then people say Why wasn't Vito like this? The reason why Vito is such an interesting character is that he is not like his counterparts in the other families. Pay close attention to the film and you will note that he never orders the death of anyone. The closest he comes is in the very beginning when he takes Bonasera's request, but he specifically states that the two men who beat his daughter are to suffer, but not to die, because it is not just. Perhaps equally as close is the warning to Michael that someone (Tessio) will betray him to Barzini. He never says to kill the person, it was basically just a heads-up. He clearly regrets that Bruno Tattaglia was killed, and especially that Sollozzo and McCluskey were killed by Michael. It is Vito's near-pacifism that exaggerates the ultimate development of Michael. Indeed, Michael waited for Vito's death to kill Carlo; Vito would have never approved of that. A second facet of this is his refusal to participate in narcotics. He says to Sollozzo it's merely for political reasons, and understandably so. But Vito is a moral man, and at this stage of his life, he sees the evil of his ways. I have yet to see The Godfather Part II, but it would not surprise me if Vito had some sort of epiphany in the course of the plot that led him to see his error. And if you can't understand him, you're not trying hard enough. Watch it twice if you have to.People also rant about the lack of violence in the film, but this is ridiculous. If it were advertised as an action film, then I could see the point. But that is not the case. And in addition, when shooting comes, like in the baptism scene, you can't ask for much more in 1972 than what you see there.Finally, the film is criticized for alleged glorification of the mafia business. I will admit that this is romanticized, but neither Mario Puzo nor Francis Ford Coppola sets out to create accuracy. In addition, people haven't really had a problem with more recent films like The Town, which gave back stories to bank robbers. In fact, Jon Hamm's cop character was easily the least likable character in that film, though the world usually perceives him as the good guy. For older movies, look to Best Picture winner All Quiet on the Western Front, from the perspective of Germans in World War I. Just because it's from the perspective of the bad side doesn't mean it's glorifying them.Okay, my rant is over. I've pretty much covered not only why criticisms fail, but also why this movie stands as one of the greatest of all time. The only criticism I may have of this film is Connie's reaction to Carlo's death. Carlo was very abusive to her, and she was clearly unhappy in her marriage, but she is extremely distraught and calls Michael a bastard after hearing of Carlo's death. It seems inconsistent, but it's not nearly enough to outweigh the final few seconds of the film, let alone everything else that makes The Godfather the classic it is.

As far as I know, Peter Benchley who penned the original novel never wrote a sequel, and Spielberg declined to direct Jaws II. Of course the answer is the producers and executives believed they would make even more money off the Jaws franchise, particularly among those who just could not get enough of the original. But as an artistic statement, this movie really doesn't warrant sequels as it covers just about everything you could possibly do with the subject. Aside from the shark killings themselves, the characters and the audience actually learn a little bit about sharks, there are political currents regarding whether or not to close the beaches, forces more interested in profits than safety are exposed, and there is even the lynching of a poor tiger shark which turned out to be a case of mistaken identity, i.e. he wasn't the shark. I always felt sorry for the little innocent tiger shark.Two characters represent somewhat opposing views of the knowledge spectrum concerning their understanding of sharks an expert scientist from the oceanographic society, Matt Hooper played by Richard Dreyfus, and a fisherman who makes his living catching sharks and other large sea animals, Quint played with convincing realism by the immortal Robert Shaw. Quint is not college-educated but he learned his trade through direct experience. Late in the film when Hooper and Quint are asked to sign on to a charter to kill the shark, their worlds collide. At interesting points, both characters misjudge the shark. Roy Scheider as Chief Brody, who used to defend innocent victims from mobsters in New York, finds his number-one most wanted man in Amity is not a human being but a shark. He ends up playing referee between Hooper and Quint. But as the last segment unfolds, we find Quint has some ulterior motives which may run contrary to killing the shark.The brilliant dramatic decision which pushed this movie into the realm of par excellence (rather than merely very good) is the delay in seeing the shark for nearly half the film. Despite the posters which show a young woman enjoying a care-free swim in the ocean with a large set of teeth propelling toward her from the depths like a menacing underwater rocket, the audience never actually experiences this scene as shown. Yes, the young swimmer is the first victim, but you never see her killer, sort of akin to a murder mystery in which you see and hear the victim's demise but you don't see the murderer. Certainly, the title of the film JAWS is a give-away as to the identity of the perpetrator, but the story begins as a kind of mystery, and almost immediately, the politics of the town begins to encroach on the decisions of Chief Brody who is mainly concerned with public safety. In one of the most memorable scenes, Brody and Hooper come upon the remains of the shark's destructive power without actually seeing the shark itself.This film was Steven Spielberg's big-time debut into the upper echelons of cinema. All kinds of interesting camera techniques are used to heighten dramatic and suspenseful effects. He even borrows a couple of trademark tricks from Hitchcock and Welles. The cast is A-list, although none of them were and ever have been big movie stars, but simply top tier actors doing what they do best. As the producers pointed out, the star of the film was the shark himself, so there was no need to put big name stars into the feature. If there is a standout in the acting department, I think it would have to go to Robert Shaw as Quint who is absolutely believable as the rough-and-ready harpooner, sharker and World War II veteran, a modern equivalent of Captain Ahab of Moby Dick fame. This is one of the all-time great action\/suspense films, but don't waste your time on the ridiculous sequels. I think the original says all that needs to be said.

I quite like the Coens' work, but this is one that has escaped me thus far, hence the borrowing of said DVD. It's very definitely a Coen brothers script with some excellent dialogue and plenty of plot twists. I'll give you my thoughts later, but here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please take that guy out into the woods & deal with him while I write the next paragraph).Tom Reagan is adviser to Leo, the mob boss who runs things around here. Rival boss, Johnny Caspar wants Leo to give him permission to have Bernie Bernbaum killed because he's making problems for his gambling syndicate. Now Bernie's sister, Verna is seeing Leo and so Leo is reluctant to upset the apple cart (if you know what I mean). Also, Verna is seeing Tom on the side and if Leo ever found out about that there was gonna be some big trouble for him. Add to this the fact that, Tom is also a bit of a gambler and has run up quite a debt, but insists on paying it off without any help. So, one day Casper makes Tom an offer and, as you can probably guess, this is where all the fun starts&#x85; I hope you understand that lot! I'm gonna leave it there so as not to enrage the spoiler police too much.As I said at the beginning, this film has a truly excellent script with some great dialogue and clever plot twists. It's a very well made film with a very appropriate soundtrack (you'll know what I mean if you've seen it). All the main cast put in very good performances; Gabriel Byrne as Tom Regan, Marcia Gay Harden as Verna, John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, Jon Polito I particularly liked as Johnny Caspar, Albert Finney as Leo and it was nice to see a cameo for Steve Buscemi as Mink.Although it has a great script, I found it didn't grab my attention the way other Coen brothers films have.

All the main cast put in very good performances; Gabriel Byrne as Tom Regan, Marcia Gay Harden as Verna, John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, Jon Polito I particularly liked as Johnny Caspar, Albert Finney as Leo and it was nice to see a cameo for Steve Buscemi as Mink.Although it has a great script, I found it didn't grab my attention the way other Coen brothers films have.

It can excite them, challenge them, and at some notable point frustrate them drastically, out of the person's natural desire to simply win. In Director Fincher's 3rd directorial film, The Game, its main player of focus Nicholas Vanhorton (Douglas) is never thrilled nor excited about the game he receives at the recommendation of his recovering addict brother, Conrad (Penn). Connie's suggestion proves to be interesting enough, for many other revealed players have proclaimed CRS to be a life changing experience. In fact one player in particular quoted Where as once I was blind, now I can see John Ch.9 verse 25, and trust me Nick sees quite the sight. Within the next few days his patience, and his usually calm demeanor are pushed through the limits of his character. Witnessing the destruction of his home, nearly drowning, and even being watched at every angle and location possible, Nicholas's hopes for an end to the game seem lost, not as lost as his brother, for he too was a participant. Nicholas's only hope is a mysterious woman named Christine, who apparently works for the company and reveals enough to give Nicholas no reason to trust anyone, including her. When Nicholas first attended CRS, it was disorganized, riddled with odd and even pointless question regarding the physical and physiological, all good factors serving as forefronts to distract him, with enough time for them to make him their pawn. His accounts, his lawyers, and even his business associates seem to be un trust worthy, with the possibility of being his enemies. It becomes very clear, in the game's true motive of changing the player completely, for Nicholas himself wasn't exactly the nicest guy around. He wasn't evil, nor greedy, just simply miserable. Witnessing your own dad's suicide can really leave some marks, marks that probably made him into the person he is. Despite being an investment banker, closing deals with various clients, moving large sums of money to various accounts, and living a more than accommodating lifestyle, Nick always had this calm, but nevertheless suppressed anger, an anger that soon diminishes at the games final and ever most devastating stage. In the wake of Nick's last chance to unravel the truth of the whole matter and settle this insane game of unending madness at gunpoint, all he is given are constant warnings, and how if he continues he'll regret his actions if not stopped. In the moments of desperation for the truth, Nicholas shoots an approaching figure, turning out to be his brother. Driven to depression over the murder of his brother, suicide becomes his last option. That fails just as much as any chance he truly had of figuring the game out on his own. His fall from who really knows how many stories turns out to be yet another part of the game. Hell the whole plan was Conrad's idea, with the purpose of changing his brother and preventing him from ever turning out like their father. In the end Nick hugs is actually alive brother in grief and relief, with a possible better outlook on his life. The Game may not be David Fincher's masterpiece, but I can certainly call it one of Michael Douglas's finest performances, portraying a character with so much anger, and misery to define his persona, that happiness is rarely shown throughout his role at all. The only glimpse of a smile viewers will get from him will be in the end as he asks Christine (Unger) for dinner. I would honestly say that the way Douglas portrayed his character was very cold, that his cold and suppressed nature perfectly fits the creepy neo noir theme of the film, making his very anger very ravage when released during moments of intensity, or personal confusion to Vanhorton. It's sad to say though that Douglas's acting isn't enough to save the film. The Game has no limits when it comes to playing with its character. All these crazy acts are physically possible, but not legal. In fact, even though the push for Nick's concluding character development was perfectly fit, it still makes you wonder if the film could've made it a little more tragic, because it was really a pretend scenario meant to help him. It sounds like Nick dodged a bullet, when most people who change for the better get a taste of the bullet. It's not easy to learn what you have in front of you, and feel like you've done everything to lose it, but when it's fake in the character's, rather than then actor's perspective, the drama seems not to moving. I still enjoyed the film, but it would have been better if CRS was a company for evil rather than well intentioned purposes, making the purpose of Nick's development all the more valuable.

Now we were past the age of censorship in the classic era and the stylistic excess of the 60s and 70s, and now more than ever great stories were being done justice on the big screen. And yet, the decade was still conflicted enough for things to be done wrong. The Color Purple is adapted from Alice Walker's beautiful 1982 novel, but was directed by prolific maker of blockbusters Steven Spielberg. The result is an unfortunate clash.This was the first time Spielberg had done an adult drama, but he had proved himself to be no stranger to deep and emotional touches, especially in E.T. However, for The Color Purple he comes across as overwhelmingly naïve, splurging on shots that simply call attention to themselves, continually casting shadows or flashing close-ups before us. All this is to the detriment of story and character. Take for example the scene in which Sofia is arrested. The moment she hits the mayor is done tantalisingly with a close-up of her hand, followed by a long shot, with the actual deed obscured by a passing car. All very clever, but this isn't the time for the director to be clever, it's a moment for the actress to shine, yet Oprah Winfrey's performance is sold short by the arty camera-work. The staging in this scene is horribly corny too, with all the white folks standing in a circle wagging their fingers, like some pantomime act. As for the various attempts at humour, these largely fall into the slapstick category, such as Harpo repeatedly falling through the roof or people scrabbling to get away from Miss Millie's driving, and they are simply undignified and inappropriate for this picture.And it's a real shame, because the acting in The Color Purple is of the highest calibre, and we ought to be able to see it with greater clarity. Whoopi Goldberg has a demanding task because Celie is a woman of so few words. However Goldberg is able to convey so much with a gesture, a glance, or an enigmatic half-smile. It's clear she understands the character, constantly feeling Celie's thoughts, and yet retaining enough mystery in her performance to keep it interesting. Margaret Avery has wonderful passion, her presence filling the screen. Although Oprah Winfrey may be a little exaggerated sometimes in her movements, her expression and vocal delivery are commanding and heartfelt. Danny Glover is great too, making his character menacing and abhorrent without descending into caricature.Indeed, there's a lot of professionalism gone into this movie. The cinematography is simply gorgeous, with sharp foregrounds against misty backdrops. The musical score by Quincy Jones (and others) is a little overwrought at times but has some lovely melodies to it, and the song Sister is a lovely slice of laid-back jazz. And Spielberg has his good ideas too, making endearing little shots like the snowman in the background when Sofia is reunited with her family. And above all things the powerful words of Alice Walker shine through, telling us a truth that has a universal and timeless meaning. This motion picture version of The Color Purple has a lot wrong in its execution, and yet there is enough to its raw material to leave us with something of value.

How? The answer is incarnated by one man, one attitude, one power. Sergeant Gunnery Hartman. Hartman incarnates the progressive loss of innocence, of human compassion, of every thing centuries of humanism did fight for. No room for tolerance, for heart, not even for patriotism, the point is to become a man capable of not only killing but not dying. I said no patriotism but that's because the security of a whole nation must rely on men so dedicated that they'd kill anyone who's suspected to be a potential threat for the country. A powerful country needs this spirit, and even patriotism might corrupt this ruthlessness because it's made of idealism, and that's intolerable. In other words, better to be a Lee Harvey Oswald than a John F. Kennedy. And one soldier will become a Lee Harvey Oswald. Gomer Pyle. A heavy man whose first reaction he inspires us, is how the hell did he make it to the Recruit Camp. He's fat, clumsy, and incapable of any physical effort, therefore an easy target for the foul mouthed intransigent Hartman. Yes their interactions are both sad and funny, but in fact, they're funny cause we're too distant from this world to get the sad aspect, and sad because we're still too distant to get how this is so real. These boys were like you and I, but by being hit, they learned how to hit. It's all a question of psychology. And it worked for Pyle, it took Hartman's humiliating words, some soap and blankets, until he became as competent as Oswald and as idealistic as him. Nothing else mattered except killing. War is the negation of anything that is not War.**************************END OF SEGMENT 1**************************When Pyle kills Hartman, it's the training's success. Pyle had a killing instinct but he reached his breaking point too fast. He was already in a world of you-know-what. It was like the war had already started for him, his war was Hartman &#x85; Pyle was already illustrating the alienating impact of the war. He named his gun with a girl's name but talked to Charlene in a sensual way, because she was his deliverance. Hartman was his war. God it's like the movie didn't even need to go further to illustrate the whole nihilistic epitome. Just look at Pyle's eyes before he shoots on Hartman and you'll know what's being in a world of you-know-what means, you see in his eyes, there is simply no feeling, no future, nothing ... **************************FULL METAL JACKET Segment 2**************************I'm perplexed.

What's her contribution apart from two or maybe three classic scenes the one with the hooker, with Animal Mother, and with the sniper. It's good, but not Kubrick good. It's like the quality dropped as soon as the most pivotal characters disappeared as if their whole antagonism were sufficient illustrations of the hellish and nihilistic states of mind war puts you in. I'm frustrated because I wanted to review the second part with the same enthusiastic approach than the first one, I really wanted and I could do it, I could over-analyze the thrilling aspect of the sniper part.

Like all of these films (Waking Ned Devine, Far and Away, Riverdance etc), The Secret of Roan Inish exemplifies what writer Natasha Casey calls Cletic commodification, reducing Ireland and Irishness to Celtic myths, quaint, pre-modern, rural landscapes, and a depiction of the nation as being forever pre-colonised. Unsurprisingly, the film was widely distributed in America and Britian (since John Ford, Irishness has always been used as a vehicle to allow white audiences to role-play being white minorities\/victims), but only had a limited release in Ireland. Its pastoral, regressive image of Irish society is more commercially viable outside of its home territory. The film is often touted as being Sayles' only non-political film, but this isn't true. Its tales of when man and beast lived side-by-side, sharing the sea, of monsters shedding their past skins, of a little girl's self determination and slow journey back to her roots, are designed specifically for the Irish diaspora. It's a call for a people to return to their homes and live alongside the now tamed beasts of Old England.Everyone wants to march into the future, one haggard Irish character says, mourning about how his country just got left behind. But the film's solution is to avoid modernization and to delve deeper into the past; a regression into some mythical pure origins, a move backward to re-establish a pre-colonial Ireland. This is not surprising. The grand narrative of a society moving from the pre-modern to the modern to the post-modern, breaks down in Ireland. After the Anglo-Irish and Civil wars, as well as hundreds of years of struggle, the Irish were concerned with maintaining the nationalist cultural identity that they were finally free to express in their self-governance. But what Sayles' film does is advocate delving into the rich identity of Ireland's past, whilst serving up only Disneyland trinkets. It's the condescending David Lean view of Ireland; the art house equivalent of a Lucky Charms cereal box. So it's not only that the film fails to give a genuine ideology of contemporary Ireland, or that it chooses an escape to the past instead of clarifying historical events, but that it pretends to be about identity when actually it's relying on mythology in order to avoid questions of authenticity (or the impossibility thereof). Ironically, with the Irish film industry in ruins, Irishness has increasingly become a sort of viscious circle, foreigners projecting Irishness onto a country who must now parrot (and export) such cosy, plastic Irishness in their own art if they hope to garner international attention. Sayles is unwittingly participating here in the kind of damaging, bottled-tourism and cultural kitsch that he denounces so well in Limbo and Sunshine State. Ignoring these issues, the film works fairly well as a children's fantasy, though I suspect most kids and adults will find Roan Inish too plain and too slow. Compare the film to Victor Erice's The Spirit of the Beehive, a masterpiece which, like Roan Inish, merges history, myth and childhood. 7\/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

After the script had been knocking around for nigh on twenty years (written by Blade Runner scribe David Webb Peoples), Eastwood seized the opportunity to play William Munney and lay bare the mythologies of the Wild West. What is most amazing about Unforgiven's screenplay is how we the audience are firmly on Munney's side, we are, incredibly, influenced by Eastwood's part in the history of the Western. In spite of Munney's obvious murky past (despicable crimes they be), we wait (and hope) for Munney to make a quip and way-lay the bad guys; actually, salivating at the prospect is probably closer to the truth. So it's with enormous credit that Eastwood, and his magnificent cast and crew, manage to fuddle all our respective perceptions of the West and the characters we ourselves have aged with. It's not for nothing that W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) is the critical character that nobody expected.

The Alberta location is magically transformed into the western frontier, with the orange and brown hues a real treat for the eyes. Ultimately, tho, Unforgiven is a lesson in brilliant film making, across the board it works so well, why? Well because the man at the helm knows this genre so well, having been its sole flag bearer for practically 25 years, and learning from his peers, Eastwood has crafted a thematically complex piece that for all its violence, debunking and melancholy pulse beats, is a film that is as beautiful as it is most assuredly stark, an incredible and true highlight of modern day cinema. 10\/10 ","genre":"Western"},{"date":"15 March 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Jerry Mulligan is a struggling American artist in Paris, he gets coveted by a rich heiress who can help his struggling career. However, a visit to a night club and a meeting with a delicate young, but spoken for, French girl, leads him into a battle with himself.Winner of seven Academy Awards, An American In Paris is of course a delightful and breezy picture from the MGM vault. Said to be the personal favourite movie of Gene Kelly, it boasts wonderful tunes from George & Ira Gershwin, brilliant art direction from Cedric Gibbons, vivid Technicolor that fills the eyes, and quite stunning choreography from Gene Kelly. The film, all told, is high on production value and entertaining enough from start to finish. Yet the film's plot is showing definite age problems now, and it also lacks the ode to joy sense of purpose that, for example, Singing In The Rain has. I also feel it's a missed opportunity to actually film the picture entirely on location in Paris instead of on the MGM lot, because a bit of earthy core feels missing from the unfolding story. Leslie Caron as the love rival to the smokingly hot older woman played by Nina Foch, is majestic dance wise, but acting she's very staid, and this too is an irritation.However, I still adore this film very much, just not as much as Gene and the Academy did, apparently! Come the grand finale it's hard to be too critical when so much energy and deftness of feet has been constructed for our entertainment. With such a production it's suffice to say that now, with all the technological advances made in home entertainment, An American in Paris is an High Definition essential. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 March 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Jerry Mulligan is a struggling American artist in Paris, he gets coveted by a rich heiress who can help his struggling career.

The City Of The Living Dead aside, which I found lots of fun and often appallingly violent, I usually find his films slow and plodding. The New York Ripper and Zombie Flesh Eaters, both banned when they were first released up until not so long ago, were unimpressive and sometimes distastefully exploitative. The Beyond, the second film in Fulci 'Gates Of Hell' trilogy (in between City Of The Living Dead and The House By The Cemetery), exceeded all my expectations. For me this is Fulci's crowning achievement - a colossal beast full of eye-gouging, human-eating tarantulas, possessed children, and most surprisingly, genuine beauty.The film begins in 1927 in the Deep South of American, where a lynch mob arrive at the hotel door of a painter who they believe to be a sort of demon. They crucify and murder him, causing a door to hell to be opened that the hotel sits upon. These doors lie all across the world, one of which was opened and caused a city to be overflowing with the undead in the first part of the trilogy. Fast-forward several decades and the hotel is inherited by a young woman named Liza (Katherine MacColl) who is oblivious to the supernatural influence that surrounds it. Despite several warnings by a mysterious blind woman, she continues to renovate the hotel and unwittingly re-opens the door to hell. Soon, the town is in chaos, with the dead in the morgue re-awakening to tear the flesh of the townsfolk.If this all sounds rather silly and unremarkable, it really isn't. Unlike his lesser films, The Beyond looks stunning. The prologue is filmed in an old-photograph style sepia, and it really helps give the film a sort of dignity. Dario Argento has always had the ability to shoot horror in a way that helps elevate the genre, and learned his trade alongside the great Sergio Leone, and here Fulci is on a similar level. The hotel interiors are shot in dark shadows and feels extremely claustrophobic, and helps create an atmosphere where you can feel the suffocation of Liza. And when the gore starts, all logic gets kicked out the window as eyeball after eyeball is gouged out of their sockets, and tarantulas emerge from a bookshelf to devour an unfortunately paralysed man investigating the hotel's history.A lot of scenes are just confusing or plain ridiculous. Certain things don't have any continuation, such as a little girl seen earlier in the film being attacked by the dead is rescued, and after a while suddenly turns into one of them with only the colour of her eyes symbolising the fact she is one the undead. Yet the other living dead can't communicate, and are half-rotting, brainless animals. But with a film this bizarre, over-the-top, and so inventively horrific, who cares? It's worth seeing for the final scene alone, which is staggeringly filmed, and hauntingly realised. Just sit back, enjoy, and ponder as to why Fulci has such a fetishistic love of people's eyes being removed from there skulls.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"15 March 2011","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Often described and referred to as a 'master of horror', I've never fully taken to the work of Lucio Fulci.

The main thrust of the plot concerns the efforts of security guard Tom (Christian Slater) to prevent assorted hoodlums from stealing the money he and his partner are transporting. The unusual element of this movie is that it takes place during a deluge which has resulted in extensive flooding, so most of the action takes place in and around a town which is almost underwater.Considering that the main appeal of the movie is the water-based locations, action and stunts, the film-makers have done quite a good job in providing a plot with a number of twists, and characters who are more than cardboard cut-outs.

It really has dated very badly indeed, the blue-screen effects sequences in particular look embarrassingly false to modern eyes. There are lame attempts at humour like when the super villains alight on Hick-town USA or Lex Luthor's badinage with his stooge Ned Beatty, ditto emotion, the half-baked love-scenes between Superman and Lois and ditto even the mandatory genuflection towards American patriotism - Superman meets the President! Like I said the acting's more cardboard than a paper cup, the late Christopher Reeve terribly wooden, Margot Kidder's less than beautiful Lois Lane dressed in awful clothes and over-emoting every which way she can, Terence Stamp as General Zod, talking in his best fog-horn voice and completely failing to engage with the material and of course Gene Hackman confirming his mis-casting from the first film. Even the music is second- hand, derived almost note for note from John Williams' original score only underlining the staleness of the fare here.The only fun to be had here is counting the number of wigs on display - there are more than a few to be spotted.

I really enjoyed the music throughout the film also, and the way it captures the varying moods so well.

This film has just had a run on EPIX on demand and I must have seen it six or seven times - it's one of my all-time favorites those few, special films that, although I can almost speak the dialogue in unison with the characters, are still the ones I reach for and watch again and again.
