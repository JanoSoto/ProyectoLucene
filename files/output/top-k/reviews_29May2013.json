With its focus being voyeurism, it takes us through the eyes through Cary Grant's eyes as we the audience are with him spying on the rest of the neighborhood around him. As he begins to feel a strong sense of suspicion from one of his neighbors, we start to feel the tension escalate throughout the movie and how this is executed by Hitchcock is just mindblowing.The movie already has enough suspense that Cary might be spotted and how this movie makes one feel a sense of paranoia is suspense at its utmost best. The sense that our characters might be in grave danger or they might just be making this all up in their hands adds a lot of psychological thrills to the story, because we the audience are trying to figure out the answers to a mystery where we don't have any proper evidence. I have honestly seen this type of story being mimicked by many movies\/TV shows today and that just goes to show the amount of influence Hitchcock has on film.From the performances to how the movie takes place in one location, 'Rear Window' is a work of pure art, but what I love is its consistent atmosphere that comes from its urban environment. The sense of claustrophobia alone adds to the suspense. It gives a great sense of just how vulnerable our characters are to begin with and as they get deeper into their suspicions, they are making themselves even more vulnerable and increasing their chances of danger and the film captivated me from start to finish. 'Rear Window' represents our curiosity in how this obsession can take control of us, no matter how hard we try to look away. Watching 'Rear Window' or any other film, it shows we all have this impulse within us to look into another world that holds a perceived mystery to us, but in this case, it's purely worth it.

If I have to pick a film that is a winner script-wise, Goodfellas would definitely be one of the top contenders. With a script like this, there are many lines that are good enough to be quotable, and it's very long list to choose from. And the desired effect is not only achieved by the script, it had to be the select number of people who be up to the task at bringing out the sharp wit of the characters and we have a cast that really shines in that department.With Ray Liotta playing Henry Hill, his performance in letting you in on the character by putting you through his perspective with his narration alone is enough to pull you in and become captivated by the film. And as he pulls you into his world, we get introduced to numerous criminals he gets mixed up with such as Tommy DeVito played by Joe Pesci, who he plays with a lot of intensity that brings out a lot of the brutal elements in the film. When on screen, you can always sense something is going to go wrong, and what Pesci brings to this character is deserving of all the praise.Every character evokes that sense of intensity that really gives this film its distinctive edge, but one person I seem to be captivated the most by in the movie would have to be Robert De Niro's performance as Jimmy Conway, who is crazier, but in his own more methodical way that is a lot more subtle than Tommy. What Bob brings to the table is something special that again shows how versatile he is as an actor and gives me another reason as to why I think he is the greatest actor ever. He may not be in every scene, but he is the foundation of the movie for me.These are all great performances that help to bring out this story and to know that these are true events makes this film even more insane than it already is. While The Godfather felt more graceful and has placed a heavier emphasis on subtlety to make the violent scenes have more impact when they happen unexpectedly, Goodfellas is sharp all around its edges. Whereas The Godfather was violent, it offered insight into the human aspects of the criminals and the reasons they murdered for business. That sense of sentimentality is nonexistent in Goodfellas and offers a bare bones, raw insight into the crooked lives these criminals were leading, and with that, you get a story that is sharp like a knife that when it hits you, you'll know you'll never forget it.

I guess if I was a die-hard fan of the group then I'd enjoy seeing them in anything no matter how bad it actually was. What makes this film so bad is that there really doesn't seem to be any idea of what this movie is supposed to be about. I'm sure it was an attempt to milk the success of the band and that's understandable. I just wish we had actually gotten a backstage look at the lives they were going through or at least gave us some sort of realistic look at the band.

Some of the scenes like the one where Swamp Thing crushes a man's head with his bare hands can also be a bit to graphical for minors. This is the way I remember it since my mother never kept a close eye to what I was watching as a kid and this resulted in me without any recognition of the English language at an age of 9 getting my hands on this tape through a friends friends older brother or something like that. Even though I couldn't understand most of the dialogue I just loved the movie with all its awkward action scenes, rubber monster-suits and most of all the voluptuous woman known as Adrienne Barbeau. A woman whom I as a kid had a crush on, a crush that made me watch everything from Escape from New York to the fantastic film The Fog.I am no longer a kid (even though most people I know keep telling me that I act like one) but I must say this piece of cinema is an excellent example of how good B-movies can be if given a proper budget. The plot is not the most original (think any other super hero from your childhood) but it has a story that is interesting and easy to follow. It sports some of the biggest genre-stars of its time all under the directing wings of none other than the legendary Wes Craven.

Up until this point he had made several short art films that had a heavy surrealist influence. Eraserhead is also an art film too. Its imagery and audio are intense, while its plot-line is pretty seriously far removed from any conventional ideas of traditional cinematic story-telling. In order to appreciate it, you need to be able to connect more with the rhythm and feel of the film, rather than try to understand its logical meaning. It's because audiences are unconsciously trained to expect the latter when watching films that many feel alienated from this movie. It's understandable of course as this is not an easy film in any sense. Not only is it not easy to interpret but its pacing is very deliberate and slow with a tone that is quite disturbingly down-beat. It probably doesn't really need to be said but Eraserhead is certainly not a film for everyone.The protagonist is a man called Henry (played by Lynch regular Jack Nance) who lives in an unspecified, bleak dystopian world. He and his girlfriend have a baby who is hideously freakish. We observe the nightmarish world that surrounds the passive Henry.In the world of Eraserhead things continually aren't what they seem, even if on the surface they look quite normal. Ordinary items such as radiators have the power to disturb. Lynch seems to have a skill in presenting everyday items in such a way that they take on a sinister veneer. It's a feature of his films overall but it was here where it was first so evident.

While the sequel does this in some regards, the plot of this film could basically be summed up as Kirsty and some other characters fight monsters. The first 40 minutes of the film, before the gates to Hell are opened, are the film's strength keeping the spirit of the original and still feeling strangely frightening. I, for one, preferred Claire Higgins's performance as the evil step-mother Julia in this film to her performance in the original. But once the puzzle is solved and Hell is opened, the film loses much of its strength.Dr. Channard begins the film as a wonderfully creepy villain, but the second he becomes a monster similar to that of the Cenobites, he loses all of his power, and even defeats the Cenobites so easily that any fear you may have held at the beginning of the film is instantly lost. The last ten minutes of the film is a mess as director Randel tries and fails to create any tension or suspense, and the Leviathan being incredibly disappointing. Part of the reason I love the original is because it is so character- driven in a genre filled with characters who just let things happen to them, rather than being the force behind everything in the film (the Cenobites, as I said before, are more of an epilogue\/conclusion in the original, rather than the entire plot). While many people argue that the film cannot be enjoyed because almost every character is, in some way, shape, or form, extremely unlikable and complicated, yet this is, in my opinion, what adds to the film's strength. All of the characters are human, which adds a level to the film, as it is much easier to place yourself in the characters's shoes.

","genre":"Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"29 May 2013","score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" As a trilogy, Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series doesn't really weigh up. The first film is an ultra low-budget &#x96; but quite suspensefully made &#x96; gore film, containing many genuinely unnerving moments thanks to its clever camera work and editing. The second and third films in the series change the tone and style completely, aiming instead for a cartoonishly over-the-top comedy feel &#x96; 'slapstick gore' as it has been described in some circles, reminiscent of a Three Stooges movie except that it's full of dismemberment and other such bloody delights. If you're after a serious, genuinely scary style of film, then Part One is the one to watch. If you're after something spectacularly bloody yet simultaneously humorous, then numbers 2 and 3 fit the bill. For me, the original Evil Dead is a quintessential master-class in low budget horror-making&#x85; skillful, tight, often very frightening. This sequel doesn't really work, showing too much affinity for its madcap gore and monsters. Evil Dead II has a much larger cult following than its predecessor but, at risk of upsetting this army of loyal fans, I'm going to stick my neck out and admit I really don't like it.Survivor of the original film Ash (Bruce Campbell) is unable to escape from the woodland cabin where he so recently endured the mother of all bad nights. Trapped for yet another evening, he prepares himself to endure more freakish horrors as the light begins to fade. He is joined by four outsiders &#x96; Annie (Sarah Berry), whose parents originally unleashed the demons in the cabin whilst researching the Book of the Dead; Ed (Richard Domeier), a professor who is also Annie's research partner and boyfriend; Jake (Dan Hicks), a white-trash handyman; and Bobby Joe (Kassie DePaiva), Jake's air-headed trailer-trash girlfriend. The five inhabitants of the cabin are left to endure various spooky events, bloodthirsty demon attacks, bodily possessions\/invasions, and so on and so forth, before they finally figure out a way to send the demons back from whence they came.Raimi's bigger budget proves a curse rather than a blessing here. He doesn't need to build up to the shock moments slowly and carefully this time around. If he requires an elaborate monster to pop up suddenly, then that is just what happens&#x85; if he needs gallons of blood and bile to gush forth rather than a mere trickle, then gallons is what he gets. The unfortunate thing is that the original worked so well because Raimi had figured out that often less can be more &#x96; his slow and skillful build-ups created real intensity. That philosophy is completely dismissed here, as Raimi opts to throw a non-stop barrage of gross and gooey carnage at the viewer right from the start. There's still a degree of inventiveness on show, especially in the scene where Ash has to sever his own hand after it becomes possessed. The sight of his uncontrollable 'demon hand' smashing plates over his head and trying to gouge at his own face, not to mention dragging his unconscious body across the floor, is rather funny.

The first film is an ultra low-budget &#x96; but quite suspensefully made &#x96; gore film, containing many genuinely unnerving moments thanks to its clever camera work and editing. The second and third films in the series change the tone and style completely, aiming instead for a cartoonishly over-the-top comedy feel &#x96; 'slapstick gore' as it has been described in some circles, reminiscent of a Three Stooges movie except that it's full of dismemberment and other such bloody delights. If you're after a serious, genuinely scary style of film, then Part One is the one to watch. If you're after something spectacularly bloody yet simultaneously humorous, then numbers 2 and 3 fit the bill. For me, the original Evil Dead is a quintessential master-class in low budget horror-making&#x85; skillful, tight, often very frightening. This sequel doesn't really work, showing too much affinity for its madcap gore and monsters. Evil Dead II has a much larger cult following than its predecessor but, at risk of upsetting this army of loyal fans, I'm going to stick my neck out and admit I really don't like it.Survivor of the original film Ash (Bruce Campbell) is unable to escape from the woodland cabin where he so recently endured the mother of all bad nights. Trapped for yet another evening, he prepares himself to endure more freakish horrors as the light begins to fade. He is joined by four outsiders &#x96; Annie (Sarah Berry), whose parents originally unleashed the demons in the cabin whilst researching the Book of the Dead; Ed (Richard Domeier), a professor who is also Annie's research partner and boyfriend; Jake (Dan Hicks), a white-trash handyman; and Bobby Joe (Kassie DePaiva), Jake's air-headed trailer-trash girlfriend. The five inhabitants of the cabin are left to endure various spooky events, bloodthirsty demon attacks, bodily possessions\/invasions, and so on and so forth, before they finally figure out a way to send the demons back from whence they came.Raimi's bigger budget proves a curse rather than a blessing here. He doesn't need to build up to the shock moments slowly and carefully this time around. If he requires an elaborate monster to pop up suddenly, then that is just what happens&#x85; if he needs gallons of blood and bile to gush forth rather than a mere trickle, then gallons is what he gets. The unfortunate thing is that the original worked so well because Raimi had figured out that often less can be more &#x96; his slow and skillful build-ups created real intensity. That philosophy is completely dismissed here, as Raimi opts to throw a non-stop barrage of gross and gooey carnage at the viewer right from the start. There's still a degree of inventiveness on show, especially in the scene where Ash has to sever his own hand after it becomes possessed. The sight of his uncontrollable 'demon hand' smashing plates over his head and trying to gouge at his own face, not to mention dragging his unconscious body across the floor, is rather funny.

There are many aspects of the movie that seem to be an analogy to our real life. And many aspects that make you think about how we view things. I also see it as chasing Moby Dick, in this case paradise.Short summary A young man finds an island that is paradise, which is a community living on a hidden beach. No rules, just fun. The problem with paradise is kind of like asking someone if they would like to be happy all of the time. It is a paradox. Yes, you want to be happy all the time, but you can't because you would not know happiness if you were happy all of the time. Do you want to live in a paradise? Yes, but it is a paradox. You can't have a paradise just like you can't be happy all of the time.Richard finds this island through someone he met named Daffy. Daffy commits suicide after kind of going crazy from realizing the paradox of paradise. Eventually Richard realizes this and becomes crazy, and then grows up and accepts the reality of things.I found many thought provoking issues in this. The one that really stayed with me is the when the two members get attacked by the shark. One dies and the other lives but moans and groans in the community until they drag them outside the community and leave him to die. Richard narrates that as soon as he was out of sight and out of mind, the problem was solved. I think about this with disabled people, mentally insane people, and especially the elders. If they are out of sight then we have no problems. Put the old folks in a home and be done with it.Another issue I find interesting is the classic case of paradise is when you have no rules and you live however you want. But Richard finds this to not really be paradise after all. Kind of like a teenager that rebels and then finds out later in life that they were really correct on things. Not so simple.In the end, I think Richard grows up and realizes paradise is not really paradise. He also finds his true self and accepts it.Overall, an interesting and entertaining movie.

However, realistically speaking, the 97 film was such a blockbuster that it's probably impossible not to do some comparison whenever you watch any story about the Titanic. This was the Cameron film's namesake - 1953's Titanic. It's the third movie account of the sinking of the ship that I've seen - along with the Cameron film and 1958's A Night To Remember - and it's actually, as far as I know, the earliest film version made. The '58 version was very bare bones and to the point - it was quite a contrast to '97 and it worked very well, probably at least in part because of that. This '53 movie is more obviously what impacted James Cameron more. It uses much of the same technique of weaving fictional story lines among the passengers around the historical event of the sinking. Not surprisingly, it isn't as ornate as Cameron's version, and the actual mechanics of the ship's sinking is inaccurate, but when this was made no one knew that the ship had broken in half. Some of the historical names are changed. In this version, for example, there's no Molly Brown, although there's a Molly Brown-like character, played by Thelma Ritter.Most of the melodramatic content revolves around the Sturges family. Fed up with her posh life in Europe, Julia Sturges (played by Barbara Stanwyck) is leaving her husband and taking her children to America to start a new life. Her husband Richard (Clifton Webb) manages to get on board the ship to convince his children to go back to Europe with him. His wife he couldn't care less about. That was a reasonably well developed storyline.Some of the historical details seem inaccurate as well, although the basics are covered. There's no one from the White Star Lines, though, on board, pushing Captain Smith (Brian Aherne) to increase speed, and the strict polarization between first class and steerage doesn't seem as strict as it should be. This is a far shorter movie than Cameron's, and as it approaches the end the emotion does build, especially as Richard finds his son Norman, who suggests that they can make a swim of it together. The actual sinking - long and drawn out in '97 - happens fairly suddenly in this, and the movie ends, I thought, rather too abruptly, with no attention to the survivors afterward and their rescue.I saw this movie many years ago and was impressed with it. It's still quite good, and it has an obviously very impressive cast. People will inevitably compare it to James Cameron's movie. That's all a matter of personal taste I suppose.

This is a film like no other that portrays a society that blurs the line between good and evil, filled with characters possessing many different oddities, where the sane and insane are basically one and the same. Every line of dialogue is witty and quotable, that it makes every situation in the movie even way more absurd than it already is, in a really good way.Malcolm McDowell is legendary in this and delivers a performance so electrifying that it will send shivers down your spine. He definitely brings out the most out of a character who is rebellious without any sense of constraint, and to see him suffer through what he's put through later on in the movie makes me feel a bit of sympathy for him, strangely, but just when we feel bad for him, he'll fill you up with disgust, once again to remind you how much he values his own grotesque freedom. His actions may be evil, but on the different sides of the spectrum, which are the sides of the good, 'do you're told' law abiding citizen to the anti-conformists, both their actions are situated in the utmost extremes that point out the flaws in each of their convictions.While both flawed, the story definitely serves its purpose of satirizing a society that values its convictions in establishing order through a system that forces everyone to conform to what constitutes a good citizen. How can society grow if we cannot let aspects of our individuality flourish? And although we should conform to having a good sense of morality, unlike Alex, we should still be able to exercise our right to freedom, instead of letting ourselves be oppressed by what society deems as 'ideal' living. And although the film leaves out the last chapter of the novel, I feel the choice of going with this ending makes just as strong of statement either way in pointing out society's flawed system.To sum everything up, 'A Clockwork Orange' is everything a satire should be, in that it is so shocking that it is able to get its points across directly. This is a film that shows ambition, but at the same time can make you laugh hysterically at things you'd feel strange for laughing at and whenever I watch this film, I feel a little twisted myself. While there are certain scenes that induce a feeling of disgust, there are many scenes that are just hilarious, and that is due to the outrageous dialogue. From watching every character interact with each other to listening to Alex's narration, there are so many overwhelmingly good lines filled with so much wit that this is bound to be a film you'd want to revisit again and again. To have a film mix dark humor with acts of a grotesque nature is one the weirdest dynamics in film and this is what I think that captivates many people to watch this film. On that note, that is what makes 'Clockwork' so great in that it executes what it sets out to do so well that you will find yourself trying not to look away at the screen, despite the horrific events that occur within in the film, and a film that can captivate me that much is in every way deserving of the title as a classic.

The eponymous postman of the film, Mario, has never taken to the patrilineal profession of fishing in his family. His widower father understands he never will and releases his seemingly simple son from his duties, to choose an occupation more suited to his abilities. In town, the communist postmaster needs a hand with the flurry of fan mail in the wake of Neruda and his wife's arrival. He greatly admires the Bolivarian bard and has his new postman run reconnaissance and procure signatures from him. Though their early exchanges may be of little significance, the two very different men of letters soon form a bond through a series of exchanges on poetry, love and politics.

The second one erupts when the Tsarist army marches down Odessa steps as Cossacks attack the revolting civilians during the famous 'Odessa Sequence'. These two sequences strike with such a crashing force not only because they are expertly edited by director Sergei Eisenstein, who rapidly cuts his camera across the various forces in action in a way that keeps one's heart racing throughout, but also because the scenes are supplemented with astoundingly evocative background score by Edmund Meisel. The images terrify at times because they're so direct, such as the close up shot of a baby getting trampled by fleeing crowd during the Odessa massacre. You cower in your seat as though you're the one being attacked, and you sit with the same expression the characters in the film have because you can't believe what you're witnessing. That's the impact Battleship Potemkin had on me in 2013 so you can imagine how deeply it would've influenced movie-goers in 1925, when the film actually released.Eisenstein's take on the 1905 incident in Russia where the crew of 'Potemkin', a battleship, mutinied against the dictatorial regime of their Tsarist officers, is partly subjective. He deliberately chose not include the outcome of the mutiny in order to present his film as a celebratory instance for the mutineers. He has included a fictitious massacre sequence that's become the most famous scene in the movie &#x96; the Odessa massacre, which never occurred. He opens the film with repeated shots of waves crashing on rocks and then takes us to the Potemkin ship, where an officer inspecting the sleeping crew unfairly vents his anger on a young member. The officer is angry because he finds it difficult to make his way through the room filled with sailors, who are huddled in a small room and given little space to sleep. As the other sailors console the weeping sailor (yes, Russians men do weep easily. Know it because I've read Tolstoy), Vakulinchuk, an older sailor incenses his crew to fight back the officers.The next day, there's a commotion on the ship as the crew complaints that their meat is rotten with crawling worms visible. An officer's response &#x96; 'These aren't worms. They are maggots. Just clean them and they're fine' (not quoting verbatim so don't bother correcting). This kind of cruel indifference leads to further non-cooperation from the crew, who refuses to finish their soup. For this minor reason, the captain willfully orders for their execution until the soldiers fight back. The spirit of their revolt further manifests in the people of Odessa, who no longer are tolerant against Tsarist oppression. Eisenstein knows the facts but he can't put across his intended message without some artistic tweaking, and so he does it without making his changes feel evident. As Roger Ebert said 'he did it so well that today, the bloodshed on Odessa steps is often referred to as if it really happened'. The bloodshed sequence comes as so shocking that I was taken to the Jallianwalla massacre that actually happened in India; it made me reflect on what it would've felt at such a moment of unbridled horror.Battleship Potemkin works excellently as a film. A similar mutiny-themed film came out in 2012 which many of you may be aware of &#x96; Les Miserables. I have a hunch that the editing in the latter film may have been influenced by Battleship Potemkin. I also know why Potemkin works so well now firstly, it was silent and so broader gestures and highly expressive classical acting was necessary, whereas Les Miserables was an overkill of broad gestures, expressions and singing,singing,singing; secondly, music is solely what drives the movie's expression without characters having to tear their lungs out singing till even music says 'Take a break already!', and thirdly, the characters in Potemkin, despite their gestures, seemed natural and made the scene look as if it was really happening, unlike the artificial Broadway feel in Les Miserables.

Basically, set in 1942, in Yazoo City, Mississippi, Willie Morris (Frankie Muniz) was a lonely boy and the only child of sometimes harsh and stuck up father Jack (Kevin Bacon) and charming and chatty mother Ellen (Diane Lane) with only a few friends, including neighbour and local sports hero Dink Jenkins (Luke Wilson) who goes to war. On Willie's birthday, against the wishes of his father, he is given a new puppy as a gift so he can have good company growing up, he names the dog Skip, and the become firm friends very quickly, playing with each other all the time. Willie does want to make some friends in and out of school though, and he does have some of the boys including Big Boy Wilkinson (Bradley Coryell), Henjie Henick (Daylan Honeycutt) and Spit McGee (Cody Linley), but they do eventually leave him alone and even allow him to become part of the gang doing something scary, which he does. The Narrator (Harry Connick Jr.), i.e. a grown up Willie explains that Skip helped him get through the best and worst parts of his childhood, helping him to make three friends and meet girlfriend Rivers Applewhite (Caitlin Wachs), but they do have a falling out when the boy's first ball game comes along. Willie is upset with a returned Dink not coming see the game and it going wrong that when Skip is there to try and cheer him up the boy hits him in frustration, and after the game he is unable to find his dog. Skip is in the graveyard where bootleggers Junior Smalls (Peter Crombie) and Millard (Clint Howard) are hiding moonshine alcohol in a crypt, the dog is hit with a spade by one of them just when Dink and Willie find him in the graveyard, the moonshiners are arrested, but the dog is hurt. Time passes as Skip is lying in the veterinary hospital and everyone is unsure as to whether he will survive, Willie sobs that he will never have a friend like his dog again if he dies, but Skip awakens and happily licks his friend's face and hands. The film ends with Older Willie (Michael Berkshire) leaving home to attend Oxford University in the United Kingdom, the narration explains that without Skip he would have no real childhood, and it is explained that Skip stayed and was cared for by the parents, sleeping in Willie's room, until he tragically died and was buried under the elm tree. Also starring Mark Beech as Army Buddy, Susan Carol Davis as Mrs. Jenkins and David Pickens as Mr. Jenkins. Muniz, who became Malcolm in the Middle the same year, is appealing as the little boy, Bacon and Lane are good as the sometimes concerned but supportive parents, and Enzo the dog is the sweetest character that steals all scenes he appears in. The story, based on a real one, is simple and easy to follow with all the right moral messages and family feel, I will admit it is corny at times, but that is part of the charm, it is a likable biographical drama that everyone can relax with.

On Willie's birthday, against the wishes of his father, he is given a new puppy as a gift so he can have good company growing up, he names the dog Skip, and the become firm friends very quickly, playing with each other all the time. Willie does want to make some friends in and out of school though, and he does have some of the boys including Big Boy Wilkinson (Bradley Coryell), Henjie Henick (Daylan Honeycutt) and Spit McGee (Cody Linley), but they do eventually leave him alone and even allow him to become part of the gang doing something scary, which he does. The Narrator (Harry Connick Jr.), i.e. a grown up Willie explains that Skip helped him get through the best and worst parts of his childhood, helping him to make three friends and meet girlfriend Rivers Applewhite (Caitlin Wachs), but they do have a falling out when the boy's first ball game comes along. Willie is upset with a returned Dink not coming see the game and it going wrong that when Skip is there to try and cheer him up the boy hits him in frustration, and after the game he is unable to find his dog. Skip is in the graveyard where bootleggers Junior Smalls (Peter Crombie) and Millard (Clint Howard) are hiding moonshine alcohol in a crypt, the dog is hit with a spade by one of them just when Dink and Willie find him in the graveyard, the moonshiners are arrested, but the dog is hurt. Time passes as Skip is lying in the veterinary hospital and everyone is unsure as to whether he will survive, Willie sobs that he will never have a friend like his dog again if he dies, but Skip awakens and happily licks his friend's face and hands. The film ends with Older Willie (Michael Berkshire) leaving home to attend Oxford University in the United Kingdom, the narration explains that without Skip he would have no real childhood, and it is explained that Skip stayed and was cared for by the parents, sleeping in Willie's room, until he tragically died and was buried under the elm tree. Also starring Mark Beech as Army Buddy, Susan Carol Davis as Mrs. Jenkins and David Pickens as Mr. Jenkins. Muniz, who became Malcolm in the Middle the same year, is appealing as the little boy, Bacon and Lane are good as the sometimes concerned but supportive parents, and Enzo the dog is the sweetest character that steals all scenes he appears in. The story, based on a real one, is simple and easy to follow with all the right moral messages and family feel, I will admit it is corny at times, but that is part of the charm, it is a likable biographical drama that everyone can relax with. Worth watching!

After some blood and gore which makes the movie worthwhile in its squeamish department, we are introduced to a depressing little family that moves into a deceased uncles house. We have some scares, we have some laughs (Especially from the zany nanny Maggie) as well as some tear jerking moments. Overall, this movie was NOT a waste of time, however, it was hard to take it seriously due to the over zany antics of the nanny. I would definitely recommend this movie and watch it again.
