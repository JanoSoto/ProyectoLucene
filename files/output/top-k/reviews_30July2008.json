Harry travels to Dante's Peak & quickly becomes convinced that the volcano overlooking the town which has laid dormant for years is about to erupt. At first no-one believes him & the townsfolk don't want to scare local businessmen away from the area so try to keep it quiet, unfortunately Harry is right & the volcano erupts with the entire town of Dante's Peak in it's destructive path...Directed by Roger Donaldson this fairly entertaining big budget natural disaster film which demonstrates how vicious the fury of mother nature can be is one of two halves, the first half is rather talky & is there merely to pass the time until the second half when the volcano actually erupts so the big budget special effect set-piece action scenes & destruction can begin. The script follows the usual disaster film rules, it focuses in on one person who know's whats coming yet no-one believes them & their attempts to warn people, it also focuses in on a normal family to add a bit of human interest & in particular two cute little kids, there's even a bit of dramatic incident when a couple of the main character's die although you don't really care that much as most of them are pretty clichéd. I am not sure if Dante's Peak is scientifically accurate or not although one would suspect that factual liberties have been taken in the name of entertainment, the acid lake at the end for instance just doesn't sound that plausible to me. Once the action kicks in Dante's Peak becomes a lot of fun amid all the destruction, near misses & special effects although it takes quite a while to get there & the journey there isn't entirely pleasant. Also someone should tell the makers of Dante's Peak that lava has a temperature in excess of 1000 °C & trying to drive through it with rubber tyres would just not work. At all.Unusually the special effects in Dante's Peak is a mix of traditional model work, on set mechanics & effects & CGI computer effects rather than if it was made these days as it would almost certainly be entirely CGI. The mixture of special effects work highlights the respective strengths & weaknesses, the model work for instance sometimes doesn't quite match up to the on-set stuff as the shades of colour of cars & the light in the sky can differ slightly between shots & of course CGI can at times just look like a bad computer graphic but overall I did like the mixture of effects work & the budget was suitably high enough for them to be of a good standard throughout. The final forty odd minutes features plenty of action & destruction from exploding helicopters to rivers of lava, from raging rivers to acid lakes, from collapsing Churches to collapsing freeways, from crashing cars to daring rescues, from out-driving eruptions to collapsing mines to the destruction of an entire town there's enough packed into the final forty minutes to keep anyone entertained, it's just a shame about the first hour or so that feels rather pedestrian & forgettable by comparison.With a supposed budget of about $104,000,000 this had a lot of money spent on it, mostly during the final forty odd special effects laden minutes I would assume. Filmed around California the actual St. Helens volcano was in Washington & was digitally added to various shots while the town used was in Idaho. The acting is alright, Brosnan & Hamilton make for a fairly forgettable & dull duo while the kids are annoying.Dante's Peak is a perfectly watchable big budget disaster flick showcasing how savage mother nature can be, while the last forty minutes is undoubtedly where the majority of the entertainment value lies the film as a whole is decent enough.

While there is a lack of military intrigue, the hospital and town authorities are cautious about a public scare. The film is somewhat dated, but then so are most of the British films of a similar age (British society has change dramatically in the last 50 years); it does cover, however, most of the themes in 'Outbreak' and is certainly worth a look if and when it turns up on afternoon or late-night TV.
