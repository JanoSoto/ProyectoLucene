So I decided to give it another viewing and this time look at it with a more critical eye. I was quite surprised by the results; which I'll talk about after this brief summary.A disease is killing the young of New York. It is carried by the cockroaches that inhabit much of the city and so entomologist, Dr. Susan Tyler is brought in to try and solve the problem. What she comes up with is a genetically modified insect that kills the cockroaches. It's a success. We now switch to three years down the line and it seems there's something praying on the lower levels of society in the subway tunnels. Some boys bring Dr. Tyler something they have found, a young of the species she had developed to kill the cockroaches&#x85; but they were all supposed to be sterile. Her husband, Dr. Peter Mann, who works for the CDC, goes with her down into the tunnels where they boys found the insect. Can they find the colony before it spreads across the city and eventually the country? Well, I guess the Spoiler Police would be feeding me to the roaches if I told you that one.Very well made with some great cinematography and some great visual effects; the creatures were particularly good. Although nobody particularly stood out, all the performances were pretty good, so honourable mentions go to; Mira Sorvino as Dr. Susan Tyler, Jeremy Northam as Dr. Peter Mann, Alexander Goodwin as Chuy, Giancarlo Giannini as Manny, Charles S. Dutton as Leonard, Josh Brolin as Josh, Alix Koromzay as Remy and F. Murray Abraham as Dr. Gates.Although I liked the look of the film and the effects were pretty good, I still found it hard to really get into. I guess the characters didn't have enough depth for me to really engage with them and so it kind of fell a bit flat about two thirds of the way through, just when it should have been picking up! Don't get me wrong, I love much of del Toro's work, it's just this one sadly failed to hit the mark. It's certainly gory enough, so not recommended for the squeamish, and it's not entirely bad, but still it's not one, sadly, I can fully recommend.My score 5.8\/10.IMDb Score 5.8\/10 (based on 17,705 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score 61\/100 (based on 33 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score 46\/100 (based on 43,507 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).

However, when I discovered it was directed by Terry Gilliam I decided to put it on 'The List'. These things take time, but eventually it bubbled up to the top and I finally got the opportunity for a viewing today. I must say it's very strange, but at the same time it's quite compelling. I will tell you more after this extremely brief summary.This film charts the adventures of sports journalist, Raoul Duke, and his attorney, Dr Gonzo. They take a drug-fuelled trip (in more ways than one) to Las Vegas, initially, to cover a motorcycle race in the desert. Moving on to a conference on drug abuse, things descend into one crazy trip. I really can't say much more about it, I guess the Spoiler Police will be pleased, but I must say it just one of those you have to see for yourself.Full of great dialogue and also some great tunes of the day; I believe it is supposed to be set in 1971. The two central parts were played by Johnny Depp as Raoul Duke and Benicio Del Toro as Dr Gonzo; both did an excellent job. Some other well known actors made appearances; Tobey Maguire as the Hitchhiker, Ellen Barkin as the Waitress at North Star Café, Gary Busey as the Highway Patrolman, Christina Ricci as Lucy and Cameron Diaz as the Blonde TV Repoter.I guess it is the narration that holds this film together; it draws you in with great descriptions of events, feelings, thoughts and the whole drug culture and the 'American Dream' thing. I thought it was brilliantly scripted. A very difficult piece to put on the screen but I thought Terry Gilliam was the perfect man for the job. It may not be as flamboyant as many of his works, but it most definitely has his stamp on it; particularly the 'lizard' scene.

There are few words that describe the brilliance of such a movie, but considering as how this film remains (to this day) to be one of my all-time favorites, I thought I should compose a few to express my fond opinion about it for anyone who has not yet experienced the pleasure of seeing it.To put it simply, this movie is utter perfection; the endless landscapes, the classic gun skirmishes, the solid performances, the incredible soundtrack... No western has even caught GLIMPSE of the heights to which this film soars, let alone reached them. This is not just the greatest western, it is one of the best films ever made, with almost no notable exceptions.The music is utter brilliance. The theme song will be playing through your mind for weeks, if it has not already. Ennio Morricone is at his all-time best here, delivering one of the most poetic and outstanding soundtracks for any western (or, arguably, any film), period. And yes, Metallica fans, THIS is the true way that The Esctasy of Gold is meant to be heard in its original version.The camera-work is also of high notability. From the huge wide-angle shots of the walloping scenery to the close-and-tight views of the characters' narrowed eyes, the contrast in camera shots will turn even the slower scenes into sheer excitement.Storywise, this film is without equal. The beautiful simplicity of a bounty hunter-turned-treasure hunter, his unlikely bandit partner and their evil rival racing to find $200,000 in Confederate gold is truly spectacular; but what makes it even more memorable is the broadness and scope on the jarring reality of the Civil War. In truth, this story isn't just about three men, but rather three men and their journey amidst the brawling past of a struggling nation, which is depicted fantastically. And the finale of the Trio Duel has got to be one of the most cinematically and musically excellent sequences ever captured on camera. Some may cringe when they learn that the film lasts a good 2.5 hours, but nowhere has a film of this length felt more fitting.To describe the cast is nearly impossible. Lee Van Cleef puts up one of his greatest performances here--he seems BORN to play Angel Eyes. His presence on-screen is truly what drives the story and conflict. Eli Wallach delivers an outstanding role as Tuco; his hilarious dialog and occasional brawls with Blondie make him by far one of the most memorable characters to graze any form of theater. Clint Eastwood is truly something to behold. Although Clint is definitely one of my favorite all-time actors, this is not quite my absolute favorite performance of his (admitedly because he's not quite as bad-ass as in, say, A Fistful of Dollars); however, this point is hardly worth mentioning, because his role as Blondie adds the perfect contrast to the others' personalities. While Angel Eyes and Tuco are considerably violent-natured, Blondie is much more passive; he rarely partakes in conflict except when he absolutely has to, but when he does he delivers the ultimate punishment to anyone dumb enough to stand in his way. In some ways, I think the movie wouldn't have been nearly as effective if Clint's character had stolen the show. Either way, every character is simply rounded and chiseled to perfection; there is no room for improvement here.To sum it all up, this movie is simply breathtaking. It's absolutely fantastic; it's utterly brilliant. The music, the plot, the characters, and the incredible direction of Sergio Leone make this Spaghetti-Western hardly JUST a spaghetti-western and hardly worth any point of criticism. I have rated this movie a 10 because, unfortunately, there is no higher number available to select (believe me, I would rate this film a 200 if I had the chance).

This is another one of those movies I'm ashamed of not seeing earlier in my life; I just can't believe I put such a wonderful movie off for this long.

Whether consciously or unconsciously, movies will reference or reshape far older narratives. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the best writers do not so much steal ideas as respectfully blend or rework them, often to rekindle the thoughts and emotions of the previous generation around the preoccupations of the present one. As the filmmakers of the modern era became ever more retrospective, such movies became more common.Edward Scissorhands is scripted by Caroline Thompson from ideas by director Tim Burton. As has often been commented, it has a fair amount in common with Frankenstein (more the 1931 James Whale\/Boris Karloff picture than Mary Shelley's novel - the narrative influences are strictly movieland). But it takes even more from the lesser-known story Being There, brought to film in 1979 with Peter Sellers, about a man (possibly autistic) who has been brought up in one house, seeing the outside world for the first time and being mistaken for a genius. Thompson and Burton channel these influences but give the whole thing the qualities of a modern day fairy tale &#x96; a fable about surviving society as a misunderstood outcast. The titular scissorhands &#x96; probably the most unique thing about the story &#x96; are the literal extensions of a person who cannot get close to anyone without unwittingly doing harm.Just as the screenplay borrows from here and there, so too does Burton take cues from his cinematic forebears in the look of Edward Scissorhands. There are some clear nods to the weird, Gothic style of German Expressionism, but also contemporaries of his like Roman Polanski, Terry Gilliam and Paul Verhoeven, directors who have specialised in taking the real world (or something like it) and making it look baroque and alien. Burton was always more an artist than a technician. His designs for the picture and the way he frames them with the camera create a small town that is both familiar but eerily strange. There aren't too many connections to reality &#x96; no visible place names or brands. The houses, cars and clothing look normal apart from the abundance of tawdry, cartoonish shades. This is not mere stylisation &#x96; it is of utmost importance for the whole thing to work. The world Burton presents is just weird enough for us to believe the inhabitants wouldn't bat an eyelid at the huge Gothic mansion looming over of the town or think a man with scissors for hands was anything more than a subject for neighbourhood gossip. The snow-covered 20th Century Fox logo at the beginning of the movie is all part of the plan. We can't be distracted by the gold and fanfare of the usual logo; we must have total immersion.The disparate influences of Edward Scissorhands extend to the performances. Lead man Johnny Depp studied the work of Charlie Chaplin in preparation for the role, something I guessed at even before I read about it. There is something very Chaplinesque in his shuffling walk and the way he innocently investigates his environment &#x96; a wordless expression of personality that is very endearing. But the best bits of Depp's performance happen on his face. He runs a gamut of emotions, filtered through this incredibly stilted exterior, from that nervous smile we see when he rides in Diane Wiest's car to the quiet anger he shows towards Anthony Michael Hall. Other than Depp, there's an excellently deadpan turn from Alan Arkin which provides a lot of the humour. The most honourable mention however must go to Vincent Price, whose appearance is brief yet has an added layer of poignancy with knowledge of the elderly actor's long and distinguished career as a patriarch of Hollywood horror.Edward Scissorhands is a movie so contemporary in its style, and yet so dependent on the influence of the past. The whole tapestry is new but every strand with which it has been woven has been seen before. And yet it has all done been done with such precision and above all such appropriateness, that even when its derivations become obvious, they only serve to deepen the power and clarify the meaning of the picture.

The first change is when the wife wants a green wall, but the evil neighbor convinces her to go with another color. Then we see as the times passes by that the matter if the husbands clients are guilty or not or how horrific their crime is becomes less and less important to him. The only thing that matters becomes to win, or rather said have the impression he won.The second is a vague sentence the devil utters while he kills one of his subordinates People have reached a point where they consider they are they're own god.

This means the pride of the people in this world has become so great that they have no more control over themselves , but they become easily controllable by him.In the end the devil presents his defends, where he mixes truth with lie to become the innocent one.

Although it is true God gave humans the power to choose between good and evil, he did not gave man the instinct to do bad.

This gives the movie a great atmosphere, and it's helped by the fact that there are not only very good performances from De Niro and Rourke (which I had expected - De Niro puts in a very menacing performance in a role which could very easily come off as campy and silly), but also mostly good performances from the supporting cast.The whole tone of the movie is very unique, mixing together a lot of the tropes of Satanic Panic movies, a weird hallucinatory feeling, and a neo-noir detective story.So why did I only give it 6\/10? Well, the whole underlying plot of the movie is far too strange and complicated for its own good, and relies on three big twists that weren't too hard to see coming...SPOILERS FOLLOW *********** The main twist is signposted right at the start, when he talks about coming back from the war with shell-shock - this immediately set off warning signals for me about amnesia plot twists, and gave away that he was looking for himself. A second twist that De Niro is the devil is also heavily signposted in that his name is Louis Cypher and he has pointy fingernails and generally plays the role of sinister tempter. Then there's a third twist that Harry Angel is doing the killings that became obvious after the second person turned up brutally murdered just after Angel had met them. To make all these twists work, however, the plot has to involve a very complicated and convenient sequence of deals with the devil, soul swapping, amnesia, face-changing plastic surgery, strange plans to fool the main character by his friends, and actual demonic possession. Despite this several things remain unclear, the outcome of the deal with the devil to become famous just resulting in one minor single, what Harry Angel actually knows and feels at the end (it seems he remembers everything, but he must now have two sets of memories one of which is just an innocent guy), why the devil made him commit all the murders without him knowing (it kills all the people involved in the Satanic cult, but also kills the doctor, who was a bit dodgy at worst, and his daughter, who was innocent, and then the devil kills the lawyer from the beginning himself, so the devil doesn't need an agent to do the killings for him, and so many murders are unnecessary to frame Angel), also if the devil has such control over Angel, it's unclear why he has to go through a long process of discovering clues to find out who he and then frame him for murder.I've gone on for far too long about problems I had with the plot.

","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"4 December 2011","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" The atmosphere of this movie is beautifully done, the power of Lisa Bonet's and Mickey Rourke's sex scene is often mentioned, but the way that scene segues into something disturbing, hallucinatory, and sinister is reflected throughout the movie, with many scenes of relaxed decadence interspersing the creepy and often chilling main story. This gives the movie a great atmosphere, and it's helped by the fact that there are not only very good performances from De Niro and Rourke (which I had expected - De Niro puts in a very menacing performance in a role which could very easily come off as campy and silly), but also mostly good performances from the supporting cast.The whole tone of the movie is very unique, mixing together a lot of the tropes of Satanic Panic movies, a weird hallucinatory feeling, and a neo-noir detective story.So why did I only give it 6\/10? Well, the whole underlying plot of the movie is far too strange and complicated for its own good, and relies on three big twists that weren't too hard to see coming...SPOILERS FOLLOW *********** The main twist is signposted right at the start, when he talks about coming back from the war with shell-shock - this immediately set off warning signals for me about amnesia plot twists, and gave away that he was looking for himself. A second twist that De Niro is the devil is also heavily signposted in that his name is Louis Cypher and he has pointy fingernails and generally plays the role of sinister tempter. Then there's a third twist that Harry Angel is doing the killings that became obvious after the second person turned up brutally murdered just after Angel had met them. To make all these twists work, however, the plot has to involve a very complicated and convenient sequence of deals with the devil, soul swapping, amnesia, face-changing plastic surgery, strange plans to fool the main character by his friends, and actual demonic possession. Despite this several things remain unclear, the outcome of the deal with the devil to become famous just resulting in one minor single, what Harry Angel actually knows and feels at the end (it seems he remembers everything, but he must now have two sets of memories one of which is just an innocent guy), why the devil made him commit all the murders without him knowing (it kills all the people involved in the Satanic cult, but also kills the doctor, who was a bit dodgy at worst, and his daughter, who was innocent, and then the devil kills the lawyer from the beginning himself, so the devil doesn't need an agent to do the killings for him, and so many murders are unnecessary to frame Angel), also if the devil has such control over Angel, it's unclear why he has to go through a long process of discovering clues to find out who he and then frame him for murder.I've gone on for far too long about problems I had with the plot.

Worrell and his feature film vehicles may depend on personal taste. If you enjoy the shtick of the late Jim Varney in this role, you may very well enjoy the movie. It goes without saying that it's going to be awfully silly at times, and it does get rather repetitive as it plays out, but there's still a fair amount of charm and good intentions to the material. Ernest in this case is a good hearted cab driver who makes the acquaintance of Saint Nick, wonderfully played by Douglas Seale. Saint Nick now realizes it's time for another person to take on the persona and perform the duties required, and he believes that person is local children's show host Joe Carruthers (Oliver Clark). Assorted wacky escapades, including an out of control sleigh ride, an airport hanger full of reindeer, and Ernest donning various disguises and pulling various scams, occur along the way. Varney is as enthusiastic and upbeat as ever, and receives decent support from the other actors, especially Seale and Clark. Robert Lesser is amusing as the stereotypically sleazy agent, and the ever delightful Billie Bird can be seen in one of her sweet old lady roles (she and her contemporary Frances Bay really cornered the market on this sort of thing). The screenplay also works into the story, among more traditional Christmas themes, the idea that people shouldn't be too quick to think cynically, or too quick to judge someone, and learn to trust them, as well as the idea of regaining a degree of childhood innocence; this is all applied to the little girl lost character of Harmony appealingly played by Noelle Parker. One of the nicest parts is when a businessmen (from Canada!) had declared to Santa that if anything he wanted to see snow for Christmas, and gets his wish. Some of the comedy really is too much at times, for example the reindeer scenes with some shameless goofy mugging (not to mention eyeball gags) from Gailard Sartain and Bill Byrge. The business with the horror film within the film may also be seen as questionable; try explaining it to the younger kids, even if it's deliberately designed as being very low rent and cheesy. It's interesting to see that the composer is the aptly named Mark Snow, who went on to be the in-house composer on 'The X-Files'. Overall, a reasonably engaging bit of holiday fare, even if just for nostalgic reasons for those who saw it at a younger age back in '88. Six out of 10.

It delivers a classic Western scenario a sheriff and his sidekicks facing down a town full of villainous henchmen while they await the arrival of a federal marshal. Quentin Tarrantino claims it's his favorite movie; John Carpenter likes it too, and his Assault on Precinct 13 is just one of the films influenced by Rio Bravo.John Wayne stars as the sheriff, John T. Chance, and his trusty Winchester costars. There's not much that can rile Chance, perhaps because Wayne had reached a point in his career when he wasn't expected to act. Dean Martin plays Dude (not THE Dude), a recovering drunkard, crooner, and former deputy. Ricky Nelson, who takes his emotive cues from Wayne, plays a young gunslinger (perhaps descended from Cherry Valance of Red River) along for the ride. Walter Brennan plays himself, and Angie Dickenson plays a neurotic young woman who falls for Chance.There are occasional gunfights, and an explosive climax, most of which are incidental to the plot. The movie is so relaxed in its pacing, and the lead performances are so restrained, that there is hardly any real suspense or tension. The bad guys who pop up now and then fail to threaten our heroes, and they are quickly despatched. The main villain doesn't make much of an impact. On its surface, Rio Bravo is hardly comparable to other Western Classics like The Gunfighter or High Noon. What makes the movie stand out, and perhaps what gives it classic status, is the easy rapport of its characters and the bantering dialogue that was Hawks' trademark. It was apparently a political response to High Noon -- a similar story told the right way -- but the movie is so chilled out that it's almost impossible to read any sort of political subtext into it.

My father has always been a big fan of Tim Burton, and he couldn't wait to show me this on our brand new VHS. I didn't understand the movie at first because I was so young, and for years I didn't appreciate how much effort went in here. Now that I have actually developed taste, I can share with you my opinion on this revolutionary masterpiece.The plot of Nightmare is based on the Tim Burton poem of the same name. It's about a Skeleton named Jack who is the king of HalloweenTown, a place where the only holiday is Halloween. Every time the celebrations end up the same, and the whole year is spent preparing for the next Halloween. Jack, being in charge of all this, gets bored and decides that he is no longer going to bother with Halloween. He travels away from town with his ghost dog, Zero, much to the town's dismay.After days of travelling, Jack discovers a group of doors, each one acting as a portal to the different towns representing each holiday. Intrigued, he opens the door the ChristmasTown, and discovers his new favourite holiday. Jack returns triumphantly to HalloweenTown, telling everyone (through the medium of a song) to prepare for something new and exciting Christmas. As one would expect, the people of HalloweenTown have rather dark visions of Christmas, and with an evil monster named Oogie Boogie in the mix, something's bound to go wrong! The whole movie is brilliantly presented in traditional stop-motion animation, with all 227 character models looking as they should; either bright and colourful Christmas workers or spooky Halloween creeps. Every character, however scary, is lovable from start to finish The music is pure genius and each line falls on top of the backing like brandy on a pudding. Danny Elfman does a great job as Jack's singing voice, which is expected considering he wrote the songs and therefore knows exactly how they should sound.Considering all these great elements of a movie, I would definitely dub it as a must-see and my favourite Christmas movie of all time. I watch it every Christmas Eve and will no doubt do so for years to come.

As if they are discovering it. In fact the films basic action does not become clear until the end in which the truth is the basic action. The film has to be watched twice in order to fully understand its meaning and clear up any confusion the plot may generate. The characters and acting itself is superb as it revolves around the four characters Martha, George, Nick, and Honey.As the audience you may find Martha to be upsetting. Her deviance and lack of tact get the better of you at times. You find that Martha (played by the late Ms. Taylor) is doing such a swell job of annoying her husband that you get annoyed with her character. This is precisely what makes Taylor's acting so rich. You believe her discontent in her life. You pity George for having to face her unending insults. You feel uncomfortable at her blatant infidelity. Finally you believe her so much that you trust her wide range of characterization and deep emotional acting.George as a character evokes sympathy, riddled with ennui. Crippled by his inability to please his soul mate he is fed up with Martha's games&#x85;and the audience gets the privilege of watching him fight back. Brought to life by Richard Burton, George is a stalwart within the film, always keeping the narrative going, and the audience waiting.Sharing the name with the deuteragonist of the film, George Segal plays Nick, an ambitious scholar climbing the social ladder with his sights on a reciprocating Martha. Nick and Martha's dalliance cause a good deal of tension in the film. He reacts to the destruction Martha and George create with horror.Honey played by Sandy Dennis is Nick's wife. She pretends not to notice the actions of Martha and her husband. Her interactions with the tumultuous couple reveal secrets and problems within her own marriage.Packed with snarky banter this film is a must see.

I will be the first to say college is a place that like high school, has a kind of hierarchy that is unfair. However, while coaches do make money and have some pull, they are not going to literally run a college campus, nor or smart kids, or nerds going to be tormented to this degree. Snubbed, yes, but I just did not see the name calling and such like depicted in the film when I was at college. To many older students, people who are middle aged so things like that are not going to happen as much. Now I do see a lot of the things happening in this film being like a high school cause I myself faced things like seen here during my time in high school. If only I could go back now and relive it at the size I am now, I would enjoy ripping the arms out of my fellow students' sockets. Or when one of them came up to me and said 'remember me', it was permissible by law to smash their faces in. Why did I have to become big and strong enough to destroy people at an age when it is frowned upon? Sigh...I digress, this film looks at a couple of guys starting their time in a college where they are sure things are going to be different. Well it is not, but during the course of the film, the nerds of the film do things that are just as bad as what the jocks do. There are some funny scenes, but at times one thinks that it is going to far such as tricking a girl to have sex with you, I guarantee she is not going to be as pleasant upon finding out the deception as she had here. There is also the idiotic robot, I do care how smart they are, they are not going to build a fully functional robot capable of the things this one is depicted as doing. Still, I liked the nerds trying to join a fraternity, liked the competition, the movie does have some funny things. It also has stuff that makes no sense, seriously why is Booger one of the nerds? A guy who drinks and acts crude is the type of guy every fraternity has in spades.

You can't really use spoilers in reviewing this movie, because it spoils itself so much much of the first half of the movie consists of clips of several scenes you see in the second half. The foreshadowing used absolutely destroyed any suspense\/horror that would have existed for me (I can't be scared of it if I know it's coming).Next there's the music track I'd like to say it consists of several great pieces of music that adequately set the tone for the scenes they accompany. Nothing could be further from the truth. Half of the instruments used I couldn't recognize and most of the musical effects seemed pointless.Finally there's the acting. As I mentioned above, Jack Nicholson's performance was superb. He's the only reason I don't give this movie a 1. The other characters? Except for the little boy, they were used as cardboard cutouts, and most of them acted that way. Even Scatman Crothers couldn't save the other acting performances his considerable acting talent was underused.In short, not a classic. Just a gore-fest wanna-be dressed up as a masterpiece.
