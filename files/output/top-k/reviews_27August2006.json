I recorded it again and watched it through. There's 75 minutes of my life I'm not getting back.I can't believe there aren't more bad reviews. Personally, I think it's because it's hard to get to the 10 line comment minimum. How many ways are there to say this is a waste of time?The movie comes across as though it was made by a few junior high kids ready to outrage the world and thinking they can with breasts, profanity, and puke jokes. The characters are flat. The parody of Swinging the Alphabet is lame, essentially cobbling the tune, getting through A - E, hitting the obvious profanity a F, and then having no idea where to go. The trip through the intestines to the expected landing doesn't work the first time, let alone the following ones.

Several people have mentioned the bathing the baby scene, but my favourite is the alarm clock scene. One thing I appreciate is that Dunne and Grant's new baby actually looks fairly new, jerky movements and all - maybe not 5 weeks old, as stated, but definitely younger than the usual Hollywood newborn. I'm sure that at the time, this movie was quite educational for many people like the two main characters, who thought that you adopt a baby by going to the nearest orphanage, picking out the one you like, and walking out with it. I only wish the filmmakers had taken the opportunity to really underline the fact that *everybody* wants a 2-year-old with curly (preferably blond) hair, blue eyes, and dimples, but what about the 99.999% of less perfect children very much in need of a good home? The film does slide toward melodrama on occasion - did it take a full-blown earthquake for Irene Dunne's character to have a miscarriage? One thing I noticed is that this film actually shows a married couple sharing the same bed! Mind you, Irene Dunne is lying on top of the cover with her dressing gown on, tensely waiting for the baby's next feeding, while Cary Grant is off to sleep, but I still wonder how it got past the Hays office. The little girl who plays 6-year-old Trina is not *too* saccharine (except for her voice), but at the end of each speech, she is obviously remembering that she's been told to Smile, dear, smile!.What ruins it for me is the ending - their little girl has been dead for only a few *days*, and her parents are ready to start with another baby. IMO, at this point, any normal parents would react with revulsion to the thought of replacing their dead child. As another reviewer mentioned, in this film it's like replacing a dead goldfish. If only the filmmakers had implied that several *months*, or better yet, a year or more, had passed, and shown the couple finding each other again first, it would have been much more believable and touching.

The fact that the average person may find the whole thing unfunny and bland is due to their just not being smart enough to understand and appreciate this masterpiece.While this is not a terrible film, part of me wishes this film had never been made. After all, this was the granddaddy of all French New Wave films and it ushered in many, many self-indulgent films that were proclaimed art despite the fact that they often deliberately used shoddy production values and were disliked by the ordinary person because they just didn't get it--yeah, right. This elitism was really just an excuse to make lousy films that, on occasion, really, really made no sense. While the movie's writer, Truffaut, went on to far better things--actually making some very good New Wave films, the success of this film encouraged Jean-Luc Godard to make worse films--such as ALPHAVILLE, PIERRE LE FOU, A WOMAN IS A WOMAN and FIRST NAME CARMEN. All these films shared common denominators in that they made very little sense, had rotten camera-work and featured people that the average sane person could care less about as their stories unfolded. Oddly enough, Truffaut and Godard got their show business start as film critics who hated traditional French movies. They began making films that deliberately violated conventions and, at times, sensibilities.My biggest problem with BREATHLESS in particular is that I truly hated the central character. Once again, Jean-Paul Belmondo plays a real self-centered jerk (what I actually want to call his character is a lot less pleasant, but kids also read these reviews). There is NOTHING redeemable about the man--he steals car after car, murders a cop and lies almost every time he opens his mouth. Plus, he just seems cocky and unlikable. How Jean Seberg's character can even stand to be around him makes absolutely no sense.A second problem, and it was deliberately done by Godard, is the annoying edits he sometimes made. He deliberately made some scenes choppy and wanted the scene to appear very choppy. Well, if bad camera-work was his goal, why didn't he just film the movie in a coal mine or put his hand over the lens! These would make about as much sense and annoy the public just as well.The third problem is that the film is very, very, very talky and dull. For a major portion of the film, the central characters lie in bed and talk and talk about pretty much nothing. Yes, I know that IS the point of FRENCH NEW WAVE in many cases, but it makes for a terrible film.The only good thing about the film was a reference to Bob the gambler. I assume this is a reference to the 1955 French Film Noir film BOB LE FLAMBEUR--especially since they also say that Bob is now in jail (that's how the movie BOB LE FLAMBEUR ended). This is a cute inside joke to an exceptional French film.By the way, I actually saw the film twice. Once, years ago and just yesterday because I thought it MUST have been better than I remembered it. Considering how I have trashed most Godard films I have reviewed (there are some exceptions), I felt an obligation to see it again just to give it a fair chance. I did and it STILL stank.

Many symbolic films are so twisted that they became pointless to anyone not still trying to earn that A in Filmology 101. Not this. Eventhe fact that none of the characters are likable isn't a turn-off, because they are so obviously just symbols. Nobody is supposed to feel sorry for any of them or see themselves or their neighbors in them.so, what was intended? I CERTAINLY don't know. The film is too well done for that. Here are guesses from other people; The George Dubya view of Brunel The War between the sexes is not just a game. It is just as much a war as the War on terrorism, and to come out ahead on either requires waging full-scale war. Sitting back trying to pretend either can be played with kid's gloves leads to annihilation. Hard to believe that is the point, but that fits as well, or better, with the film than some of these other views.The Andrea Dworkin view of Brunel Given that Brunel dwells on chastity and sexual morality ... Is sex rape? Is stealing virginity, stealing? Interesting how horrible news is recited while the torn, bloody nightgowns are being exhibited, but just as the women begins to mend the holes, the radio switches to pleasant music. Are we to take it that man's dominance of women, even the act of sex, equates with terrorism? Again, hard to believe that is the point, but that fits as well, or better, with the film than some of these other views.The bigjack2 view of Brunel bigjack2's comment on IMDb is the best review and the most plausible view. Read it. Vote for it. Get it to the top. It isn't far removed from the Bush view, in that focus on the analogy between terrorism\/anarchy and the war between the sexes. I didn't know Brunel, but if big jack2 is right that Brunel held Trotskyesque views, this is probably the best analysis.Speaking of views at the top; how did people find the one form the film buff from Ohio or wherever helpful? He calls this one of the most bizarre films? Are you kidding me? I don't watch that many films. OK, I do watch a high ratio of obscure or artsy films, but this film doesn't even make it into my top 30 for most bizarre films I've seen. Mr. Film-buff says Bombings and deaths are at an all time high, yet he (Mathieu) doesn't really seem to notice this. He is oblivious to his surroundings. Are you kidding me? Mathieu is shown reacting to these events with disgust innumerable times. What? He doesn't leave his career and move form Paris to Timbuktu? Is that what makes him oblivious? Mathieu went on with his life in the face of terrorism, just as people do today. Mr. Film-buff says I would go so far as to say that we are also oblivious to the surroundings ... we sometimes forget or miss the actions surrounding this film. Well, I think it is obvious you were oblivious, since you didn't seem to notice the innumerable times he is shown reacting to these events, but please learn to speak for yourself. The film has so many great scenes. Why has nobody mentioned the scene where Mom asks Mathieu So, you want to marry her? and at that very moment, a mouse gets his neck snapped in a mouse trap in the corner of the room. Great stuff. Along that line, what was the point of the fly in Mathieu's drink? And why did the owner of the club refuse to serve Conchita just after she quit, but then the next time, he practically prostrated himself for her. What change was supposed to have occurred? Was it the point that she was now known to be living with a rich man, so she had to be respected?The other under-discussed method is the makeup of the strangers on the train. A dwarf, a judge, a mother, and her YOUNG daughter. Firstly, why does Mathieu tell this story in front of the young girl? Before she is shooed out of the cabin, Mathieu has already dived deep into the war-of-the-sexes aspect. And why a dwarf? A dwarf playing a psychology professor who gives private lessons? Huh? This has to be a slur on psychology professors, because this professor interrupts repeatedly to make blatantly obvious points, and acting smug while doing so.

I didn't know Brunel, but if big jack2 is right that Brunel held Trotskyesque views, this is probably the best analysis.Speaking of views at the top; how did people find the one form the film buff from Ohio or wherever helpful? He calls this one of the most bizarre films? Are you kidding me? I don't watch that many films. OK, I do watch a high ratio of obscure or artsy films, but this film doesn't even make it into my top 30 for most bizarre films I've seen. Mr. Film-buff says Bombings and deaths are at an all time high, yet he (Mathieu) doesn't really seem to notice this. He is oblivious to his surroundings. Are you kidding me? Mathieu is shown reacting to these events with disgust innumerable times. What? He doesn't leave his career and move form Paris to Timbuktu? Is that what makes him oblivious? Mathieu went on with his life in the face of terrorism, just as people do today. Mr. Film-buff says I would go so far as to say that we are also oblivious to the surroundings ... we sometimes forget or miss the actions surrounding this film. Well, I think it is obvious you were oblivious, since you didn't seem to notice the innumerable times he is shown reacting to these events, but please learn to speak for yourself. The film has so many great scenes. Why has nobody mentioned the scene where Mom asks Mathieu So, you want to marry her? and at that very moment, a mouse gets his neck snapped in a mouse trap in the corner of the room. Great stuff. Along that line, what was the point of the fly in Mathieu's drink? And why did the owner of the club refuse to serve Conchita just after she quit, but then the next time, he practically prostrated himself for her. What change was supposed to have occurred? Was it the point that she was now known to be living with a rich man, so she had to be respected?The other under-discussed method is the makeup of the strangers on the train. A dwarf, a judge, a mother, and her YOUNG daughter. Firstly, why does Mathieu tell this story in front of the young girl? Before she is shooed out of the cabin, Mathieu has already dived deep into the war-of-the-sexes aspect. And why a dwarf? A dwarf playing a psychology professor who gives private lessons? Huh? This has to be a slur on psychology professors, because this professor interrupts repeatedly to make blatantly obvious points, and acting smug while doing so. Is the point that most professors are mental midgets? I don't know. And why is the judge the least judgmental of the bunch?Another question; what is obscure?

So, given that I have given very positive reviews for FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE and THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY, my being far from impressed with this film isn't because I dislike the genre or have it out for Mr. Leone! No, I have some legitimate reasons why I think the film is overrated--certainly very few of the IMDb users can honestly think this movie is one of the best 25 movies of all-time (despite its high IMDb score).The biggest problem is the terribly slow pacing. While none of his films of the genre are fast-paced, they are deliberately paced and hold your interest. However, this film could easily have had 45 to 60 minutes chopped out of it without a major negative impact on the movie. The buildup is just way too long and drawn out to allow this to be a great film. Self-indulgent in its pacing, yes, but not great. I don't want to watch Jack Elam blowing a fly off his face again and again and again. I don't want to see closeups of the actors eyes again and again and again. And I certainly do not want to have a scene take three times longer than it would in any other Western! The second biggest problem is that although the film seems like a meticulous labor of love in some places, a few other ones it is just plain sloppy. The absolute worst is the actor who seems to play a younger version of Charles Bronson. Not only does it look almost nothing like him, but the eye color doesn't even match--and considering all the closeups of eyes, this is just sloppy (Bronson's are bright blue-gray and the other has dark brown eyes).

However, this film could easily have had 45 to 60 minutes chopped out of it without a major negative impact on the movie. The buildup is just way too long and drawn out to allow this to be a great film. Self-indulgent in its pacing, yes, but not great. I don't want to watch Jack Elam blowing a fly off his face again and again and again. I don't want to see closeups of the actors eyes again and again and again.

When I saw it, and then saw it again numerous times on DVD, I was always very emotionally disturbed by the deep places the movie goes.I never thought about Tom Cruise being an insane murderer, driven to extremes because of his guilt.To me, the central message of the movie is that one moment in life, ONE moment, can change things forever. It's a life lesson that smacks you in the face like brick. For David, the one moment is that he has treated this girl like a toy, with no respect, and she's hurt by it, and in her rage and love for him, angrily tries to kill them both because it hurts too much. She can't stand being his love puppet any more. She WANTS to be taken seriously by him, but to David, she's just a toy.And I absolutely love the way this movie weaves in modern technology as a possible way out of a bad reality that we have created for ourselves through our own rash decisions. It shows a potentially frightening future of being able to live how we wanted to after we die, through a prolonged filtered dream life.To me, this movie is really a mix of techno future, drama, alternate reality, and maybe even slightly fantasy. Not at all a psychological thriller\/murder mystery in the least! What happens between him and Sophia, or the supposed murder, is secondary to the central theme of trying to alter one's real life through suicide induced after-life.I see this as a kind of a Heavy Metal type graphic novel fantasy story, in which a young man who has a devastating accident and can no longer handle the loneliness and pain of living as a disfigured mutation in society. In desperation, he turns to prolonging his life after he commits suicide, and does it in a very haunting way, the lucid dream in which he can have whomever he wants as a lover, have whatever life he wants, or should have had if things had not gone so wrong.I don't think that the tech support man at the end of the movie ruins anything....in fact I like that he explains what happened to David. To me the explanation makes the whole fabric of the story that much more haunting.To me, the plot was actually pretty straightforward. And I personally feel that his life was completely real up until the point he committed suicide. At that point the company that froze his body switched on the lucid dream option, which begins by Sophia accepting his disfigurement and picking him up off the street and taking him in(the point where David's life is over, and the lucid dream kicks in), and they fall in love all over again. What a lot of movie goers failed to grasp was that David was not DREAMING or hallucinating what he wanted in life while he was still alive....but that half of the movie actually takes place with him already dead.And another thing that movie goers really failed to grasp onto....was that all that was really happening in the second half of the movie was what the tech guy said it was..a GLITCH! And I love that concept! That maybe the company hadn't worked out fully the technology of the lucid dream, and that things could go wrong in this death\/dream state. That's why tech support had to go in and enter David's world just like another character.I mean think about it...if you are already in a lucid dream state, the only way tech support could reach you is to enter your dream state and explain what is going wrong! I think of it like a very, very weird type of internet support, except YOU are the subject of tech, and the glitch is in your head.So, for me this movie is a fantastic vision of the regrets we have in life, and the decisions that led up to those regrets, and...and what if.....what if we could actually have a way to take the consequences away, to take the pain away? That girl that slipped away? That job we didn't take? That thing we wanted to say, but never said before our father died? Make it all better?

There is no good reason for any of this insanity, either in the plot (script) by Edward Bunker nor graphic direction by Andrei Konchalovsky. You have to rely upon their imagination and the wonderful cinematography - it is highly implausible that anyone has every lived-through this kind of brutality to tell about it. I hope. It is imminently important for the viewer to know that Manny (Jon Voight) has been welded in his cell for three years; that everyone looks up to him for his physical strength and wildness; that he only has nine months to go; a maniacal warden (John Ryan) wants him to screw-up so he can shoot him; that the entire prison is constantly in a riotous upheaval; and anyone who even THINKS they could successfully do any of this in 35-below-zero weather NEEDS to be welded into a cell, if they were lucky.We all are aware that humans cannot survive in below-freezing weather and water, yet Manny and Buck (Eric Roberts, in a fabulous performance) get naked in the bowels of the prison to smear themselves with some nasty stuff and wrap themselves in plastic sheeting, the theory to keep their body-heat in and the plastic from freezing to their skin. Guess what it works, although they tromp through the prison's sewers and then jump into an icy stream, Buck not even having shoes, gloves, a hat nor warm clothing, then trudges through miles of snow-storms to the railroad-terminal. So many improbabilities in these scenes it's mind-boggling no frozen clothes nor frost-bite? Anyway they get there, find some things they need and choose a train to get on, simply because Manny thinks it's looks like a monster. He's right.

After a thorough beating by Manny, Buck says you were my friend....my hero....hmmmmmm......Sara (Rebecca deMornay) does instill a trifle of humanity in them......but barely.If that isn't enough of the story to get you hooked nor scare you away, watch the movie and then try to shake yourself out of the stupor you get into, and analyze the whole thing. It won't be easy. This is not sci-fi - these are all incidences that COULD happen. Some think this vicious role is Voight's best - good acting, but too crude.

This movie is terribly made! (And I'm a Martin Scorseese Fanatic!) This is one of two Scorseese films that I did not like! The majority of actors sleep walk through their roles (With the exception of David Bowie, who is the best thing about this film!) I do not condemn this film because of the controversial elements, after all, it does not teach that Christ did have an affair with Mary Magdalene, only that he was tempted to! (The Davinci Code, on the other hand...) I give it four stars for an attempt to show the human side of Christ! I applaud Scorseese for wanting to show a part of Christ that most people don't want to see, the Human side! But I feel that he went about it the wrong way, (The right way was with Jeffery Hunter in King of Kings) the film moves very slow, which Scorseese films seldom do! This shows me that Scorseese was unsure about what he was doing, I believe the man has a faith in God, but that he was afraid of the possible negativity that the film would generate, therefore his usual pacing and brilliance did not shine through, I wanted to like this film, but I'm sorry, good ambitions do not a wonderful film make! I think that all the praise on the IMDb are people who are happy that Religious people were upset by it! How many of you have seen it more than once? Not at the box office, as the numbers would indicate! (Mel Gibson's film, on the other hand was seen by enough people to put it into the top ten money makers of all time!)

It's sort of half fantasy, half indictment of America. I might have never heard of Bjork before this movie came out, but it's the sort of film that leaves you almost breathless. Bjork plays Czech immigrant Selma Jezkova - who interestingly looks closer to Asian - working in a factory in Washington state in the early to mid '60s. Expecting the good life when she immigrated, she instead lives a grim existence, but occasionally breaks out into song in her own fantasy world. But when tragedy strikes, everything changes...sort of.I know that Lars von Trier likes to make a point of indicting the US for various things (although I haven't seen his other movies). He certainly does that here, but it's hard to say to what extent he really succeeds. The truth is that the movie is so over-the-top that it's nearly impossible to tell what to make of anything. I understand that Selma would like to escape this drudge of a world that she inhabits, but are her fantasies all that realistic for someone stuck in a life like hers? Personally, I can't tell whether the movie is trying to be cynical or optimistic...although I would suspect cynical.Still, it is a movie that I recommend. Many of the scenes and musical numbers are quite impressive. Also starring Catherine Deneuve, David Morse, Peter Stormare (happy birthday, Peter!), Joel Grey (that's right, the owner of the Kit Kat Club), Zeljko Ivanek and Udo Kier.

Their first film was before World War II, The Lady in Question where both are young Columbia contract players who were in the same film and no effort was made to bill them as a team. The Loves of Carmen which was made after Gilda was a disaster for Glenn Ford, though Rita was at her sexiest. Affair in Trinidad was a good effort to recapture the magic of Gilda after Rita's storm marriage to Aly Khan and the last film The Money Trap was a Glenn Ford film where Rita has a brief role as an old girl friend. She was the best thing in that film by far.Do you remember in Cabaret how both the Liza Minnelli and Michael York characters find out they are sex partners to the same German bi-sexual man? That's essentially what happens in Gilda though with the Code firmly in place it's not something we talk about. George MacReady, a man of many interests rescues Glenn Ford from the docks of Buenos Aires after he's won some money from sailors in a crap game. They hit it off and Ford becomes his right hand man in running the casino MacReady operates.Then MacReady brings home a wife and lo and behold it turns out to be an old girl friend of Ford's, Rita Hayworth. Add to that some Nazi refugees have some business with MacReady over some tungsten mines. The real emphasis in this film is sex and personified by the best embodiment of sex ever on the silver screen. This film raked in a lot of dollars for Harry Cohn and Columbia Pictures. Hayworth, voice dubbed as usual, had a big number here in Put the Blame on Mame. It became a signature tune for her the rest of her life. One thing did disappoint me about Gilda. For a story that took place in Buenos Aires who many say is the most beautiful city in the world, it would have been nice to see some location shots, even if it was just some newsreels to establish the time and place. The film might as well have been in Albuquerque. But when you've got Rita to look at, it could be at the South Pole.

So many quotes from this film are used in other films & media that they have become cliché almost. Even miss-quotes like Play It Again, Sam from this film have become American folk-lore. Round up the Usual Suspects has become it's own film later. You & Me, Kid- the list goes on & on.Other than the Great Oz, these quotes just flow from this film to 100's of other works since this film was made.What makes this film really special is the unfulfilled love between Bogart & Bergman's character that is left hanging at the end. In an era, where love always had to have a happy ending, this movie gloriously leaves us with people in love who are forced away from each other by circumstances beyond either of their control. This theme is closer to real life than most Hollywood products of any era. Almost everybody can identify with it because haven't we all had a love in our life who we yearned for very much, but due to circumstances beyond us, we never had a chance to fulfill? That is too me what makes this film stand above all others.This is a film that has action, but not much of it. This film has comedy, but only enough to make the film great. It has subtle patriotic themes that carry the film along. Most importantly, this film has the heart of every viewer who ever watches it because the film, by accident, touches themes that many films aspire to reach, but never achieve. Ironically, this all happened by the greatest of chance & rarely has any movie ever come close to what this film is. If I were a filmmaker, actor, or had a career in this industry, this would be the film I wish I had worked on. Nothing gets better than this one.

It's vulgar, classy, and upright the sh@t! I saw this in seventh grade, while my mom was making dinner or something (I don't know I can't quite remember, let's say that she was making chili dogs because those are a good dish). The funny thing is that she didn't start acknowledging the movie until she heard 37 d@icks (I just threw in an 'at' symbol). Why wasn't she paying attention to the movie before, was it because the movie was in black & white and that sort of movie provoked no interest for her, but when she saw that her 12 year old (i might have been 13) was watching a dialogue with 37 d$icks as its topic, she gave a look. When she was recognizing its demographic, she told me that 'you are not buying this movie' (it was a rental, i rented it after I saw the cartoons--another worthy watch) So as such, since the DVD was a five-day rental, I was watched 'Clerks.' every single day of that 5-day period. And each day, the movie just got better and better--it was sweet. Each time I watched it, I felt like I was there, it was a 3-dimensional world of 'clerkhood' that surrounded innocent little being. I loved it and I was even a mature a$$hole just yet. So, if ever you want to see 'Clerks' and take in all for what it is and more, make sure you watch it when you are in the seventh grade, that is if an inexperienced, newly-introduced to the styles of masturbation-6th grader is reading this piece of crap.I sorely recommend this--so sorely that if it must make me embody an irritating zit on your a$$ to persuade you.This was ichabod_crane1899 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 August 2006","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Clerks is the about number 2 on my list of one of the most funniest movies out there.
