Yes, this is a perfect example of what happens when a group of mere mortals, out of some greed to make more money, get together to reduce an immortal legend to scrap.But the worse part was that one of those mortals was the production company itself that was assigned with the task of preserving the Legend as it was.Way back in 1997, when I watched this movie in theaters as a teenager and knew nothing much about The Batman except that he is a superhero who works at nights, I was not that much interested in Batman as I was in Schwarzenegger. I was and still am a big fan of Arnold for everything he is and whatever he has done in his life. Given an opportunity of four lifetimes, ordinary people won't be half as successful as he is today, in those four lifetimes. But... an actor, director or the producer can NOT be larger than the character in the movie itself. If they try to be, that is Blasphemy for me. And today, after reading a lot of authentic material about The Batman, I realized they actually practiced Blasphemy. They destroyed the characters of all Batman himself, Robin, Batgirl, Poison Ivy and in particular my favorites Mr. Freeze and Bane (oh, that was the cruelest blow.) OK, I can imagine this Suddenly out of some sleep, Warner Bros. wakes up and thinks itself to be the Disney Company. Now they're thinking of nothing but money and more money. They bring on Goldsman who also wakes out of some deep slumber and jolts down on a piece of paper, something called 'family friendly script for B&R'. WB, already wearing the goggles of greed on its eyes, approves it. WB then brings on-board the same Schumacher who had already destroyed Batman in 'Batman Forever'(I won't even mention the year, I won't want people to refer to it on IMDb.). And then what follows is the non-direction of actors with capabilities ranging from OK to Good, acting for a non-existent script with campy utterly-bad stunts\/visual effects\/lights\/one-liners. And its unimaginable they decide to use Batman as a medium for family entertainment(???) (which he is not for), just because they had the rights to Batman franchise ! Acting George Clooney as Batman? He only plays himself and lays himself in every movie he works with (OK, 'Ocean's Eleven', 'Three Kings', 'Syriana', 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' were good but there are more bad movies of his then good ones.). He could never make it as the Dark Brooding Vengeful Batman. Uma Thurman, a decent actress herself, has bordered on the lines of cheap profanity here as if undergoing fake multiple org**ms. That's the ONLY way to describe it. I can't believe she played 'Poison Ivy'. And I can't believe Arnie rolled back his promise of not playing villains in movies for this scrap role that was anything but Mr. Freeze. Oh, yes! the money, of course! 30 million something! A record at that time! I can understand these actors are helpless in front of the big three producer, writer, director. But they at least knew what they were getting into and that makes them guilty enough. I am OK with the IMDb's concept of not having ZERO in their rating system. Otherwise, it will appear as if even though any movie whether, good or bad, people are not aware of it and therefore nobody rated it. But IMDb should come up with one negative rating '-1'. Particularly for movies like this. At the time of me writing this, this scrap is rated as high as '3.5' ! Do people who rate scrap as more than '1', exist? This is a sacrilege for Batman fans like me. I observed some people rated this movie 9\/ 10 just because 'they liked it, the fun\/action and all'. But then where would then the actual masterpieces like 'Schindler's List(1993)', 'SE7EN(1995)', Goodfellas(1990), Godfather,The(1972-74), Terminator(1984-91), Matrix,The(1999-03), ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE(2001), LOTR(2001-03), Silence of the Lambs(1991-2003), Forrest Gump(1994), Malcolm X(1992), Glory(1989), Cry freedom(1987), Sixth Sense,The(1999), Unbreakable(2000), Elizabeth(1999) stand? Thankfully, common sense prevailed and Nolan brought the real-real Batman movie 'Batman Begins(2005)' and the phenomenal masterpiece 'Dark Knight,The(2008)'.No other good or great movie from Schumacher, Oscar winners Goldsman or Clooney is going to repair the irreversible damage that they have done to Batman. (They never read the Batman comics, They just shamelessly *BEEP*ed it up.). I hope these three Blacken their faces and hide somewhere, Oscar winners or not. All existing records\/proofs\/sources of this B&R-scrap should be destroyed. NOW.... And there were no Nipples needed on the Bat or Robin suit which they anyway showed.

First off the problems I found with this movie is it crammed too many characters in it. My list of the flaws 1. The movie didn't need three villains. Especially Bane, since they turned him into a mindless grunt that never speaks on his own accord, just repeats very word he hears. Man, I miss the Bane from the comics and Batman The Animated Series. Those Bane's where way better than this clown.2. Why did Joel decide to add in a lot of dumb sound effects like when Batman and Robin are getting dressed into their costumes you hear a lot of lame sounds. At many other scenes threw the movie they added more lame sounds. To name a few more like when Mr. Freeze freezes the Dinasaur statue in the Museum and it falls apart you hear a dinosaur's screech it sounded like. At the Wayne's Diamonds party when Mr. Freeze and his gang raid the place, Robin throws a tray at one of Mr. Freeze's thugs and trips him, another stupid sound that sounds like WHOOOP. I mean what where the makers of this movie thinking with adding crappy sounds to go in with scenes in the movie? 3. Too light and colorful for a Batman movie. Too many flashes of colors threw the movie it makes me feel like I was watching the Teletubies. 4. Too many stupid gadgets Batman and Robin used. Like the heat guns, bat heaters, and ice skates that pop out of their feet. I mean why would Batman and Robin even think to invent gadgets like this. How would they ever guess they would someday be going up against a Frozen man in a suit. Also after Batgirl defeats Poision Ivy and they all three go to the Obseritory to stop Mr. Freeze, where the heck did they get these new suits and vechiles so fast. I mean where they building these vechiles threw the movie. Why didn't we ever see them in any scenes until the end. It is like they just pop-ed up out of no where and have Ice proof vechiles and suits, very stupid. Again I must ask, What where the maker thinking?5.

This movie didn't need Batgirl at all. Not to mention they screwed up her character from the comics. In the comics she wasn't Alfred's niece. Also her being in that Motorcyle race was so stupid. Another colorful scene. Also why would they race off half of a bridge? 8. Stupidest fight scenes of all the fighting in any Batman film. Also I noticed this movie had the least action of any of the movies.Well that completes my list of why this movie was so horrendous in my opinion. Batman Forever was just as bad.

The more that I have thought about this film the less I like it. There are too many coincidences and improbabilities - the unlikely encounter between Hank and Leticia was a little hard to digest, but then we are asked to accept the suicide of Hank's son (in an implausible scene), the death of Liticia's son, which is there primarily as a plot device to get Hank and Leticia together, and the ultimate union of Hank and Letitia. And there are Lawrence's drawings through which Hank and Leticia individually discover the prior link between them - another phony plot device. All of this seems to come from a screenwriter's imagination rather than real events.So many scenes did not ring true for me, like Hank running the black kids off his yard with a shotgun. Knowning what a racist Hank was, these kids would long ago have known not to come near his yard.The initial scenes of Lawrence's death in the electric chair are indeed realistic and harrowing. But I have seen enough of such scenes (starting with the 1958, I Want to Live!) so that one more is one more than I need or desire to see.Billy Bob Thornton is good at playing Billy Bob Thornton, which he does here without breaking a sweat. I am not as impressed with Halle Berry's performance as are others, including the AMPAS. She was good in some scenes and great in others (like the final scene), but sometimes weak elsewhere. She played the part of an intoxicated woman like she thought such a woman would behave rather than what would seem real, but this could have been the director's call. Heath Ledger's brief appearance convinces one of what was lost when he died. The real standout performance was Peter Boyle as Hank's father. It would take courage to play such a disgusting super racist so convincingly.It was important for us to know that Hank and Leticia were having sexual relations, but was it necessary to be so explicit? And if explicit was necessary, was there a need for more than one such scene? What purpose did that serve beyond titillation? I felt manipulated rather than involved.

Now, the film is interesting and well-made and the characters are cool. Sam Jackson shows up, Danny Aiello and John Turturro are great. Ossie Davis gives a memorable performance, and Public Enemy's Fight the Power remains constantly in the background. (Martin Lawrence and Rosie Perez also make debut performances here.) So, don't get me wrong, the set-up is there. But my issue is with Spike Lee.The film is ambiguous, which is both its strength and its weakness. By contrasting Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, we are unclear if the film endorses violence or not. But Spike Lee's one words seem to suggest violence is justified. At the climax, Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) demands that Sal post photos of black celebrities on his wall. Sal refuses, and further asks Raheem to leave because he blasts his music in the restaurant. Before long, Raheem attacks Sal, the cops are called and Raheem is killed. A riot breaks out and Sal's is burnt to the ground.Lee has said white viewers don't understand the film because they rank white property over a black life. Well, I'm a white viewer. And I don't think Raheem should have died, but I see no justification for Sal's to be destroyed. Sal was a fine member of the community and he was not responsible for Raheem's death, the police were. Both the property damage and murder were wrong -- I think Lee is off-base to make it an either\/or scenario.Now, he leaves himself an out by having Da Mayor express the greatest lesson in life is do the right thing, and the moral of the story could be that practically nobody in this film did the right thing. So it could be shown that the movie is teaching us right by showing us wrong. But Lee's words don't suggest this interpretation, and his lead character, Mookie, clearly favors unnecessary violence (which Malcolm X may have wrongly termed self-defense).The American Film Institute puts this as one of the top 100 films of all time.

If your instinct tells you something that society, logic, reason, and ego all tell you are ridiculous, what do you do? When you take notice of something that no one else believes, the same things that tell you your instincts are ridiculous are again in question. It is no surprise to me that the film's concept was created by Daphne Du Maurier, the author of the famed Gothic psychological thriller Rebecca, which was adapted into a movie by Hitchcock, for Don't Look Now seems very likely to attract Hitchcock to the helm, with its ominous suspense, glimpsed details, sudden moments of tension, and the plot itself. Only Nicolas Roeg directs instead, and not so incomparably to the aforementioned master.This disturbing, cerebral drama tells the story of a couple, Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland, whose young daughter has recently drowned in a tragic accident at home, the grief from which applies tension to their marriage. In search of a change of scenery and a chance to work through their pain, they take a working vacation to Venice, where Sutherland has been contracted to restore an ancient church. While he works, Christie is befriended by two strange elderly sisters. One of the sisters is blind and claims to be in psychic contact with her dead daughter. Christie is drawn to the sisters, but Sutherland finds their influence on her unsettling and suspects them of deceit. The ensuing drama is set against a subplot involving a serial killer who has eluded the police. You have no idea where it goes from there.

Even apart from flashback sequences, flash forwards, elements of clairvoyance and premonitions, and other such individual considerations, there is definitely an impressionistic melody, remarked upon in part by one of Pino Donaggio's best scores, and Roeg's seemingly unostentatious, courageous sex scene between Sutherland and Christie is an extensive episode wherein subtext can either be found or felt, because instead of stagnancy, the scene brings flavor.

Although I did not appreciate it on my first viewing, I came to love it, and now it's one of my favorite films of all time. Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) comes home from college to visit his sick and bed-ridden father who had a tragic accident. Having made a startling discovery (to be more exact, a human ear lying in the grass), out of sheer boredom and driven by passion for adventure Jeffrey decides to proceed with this mystery and gets involved with a beautiful, seductive night-club singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) living in a shabby apartment building, which is somewhat incongruous to the sleepy, picturesque suburban paradise of Lumberton.Dorothy, a queer mixture, of damsel in distress and femme fatale, is in a middle of a life and death situation involving her husband and son. She is subjected to sexual abuse and other forms of violence by a psychopathic man named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) and his demented associates. Jeffrey's further investigation reveals that one of the police detectives is also involved in the criminal activities of the gang, and that means that he will have to deal with these people using his own resources. He confides in Sandy, a good-natured and sweet blonde, whose father is a hard-working and honest policeman. Sandy is obviously fascinated by Jeffrey's recklessness, but her level-headed nature prevents her from becoming his full-time accomplice and ditching her boy-friend, at least, not until later on.Stylistically, Blue Velvet is a precursor to Lynch's notorious collaboration with Mark Frost - the cult classic TV series Twin Peaks. These creations share a lot of elements including the small seemingly sleepy town setting, a dangerously attractive brunette, oldies often played under disturbing circumstances, dreamy angel-like singers (remember Julie Cruise in Twin Peaks), flame and even the famous red curtains. Although Blue Velvet is an erotic thriller without any supernatural context, somehow you expect the Dwarf to pop up and start dancing at any time... although no dwarf appears, it manages to get just as weird as Twin Peaks.The blue velvet is a leitmotif of the film. Blue Velvet is a song that Dorothy has to perform in a club every night looking straight in the eyes of her tormentors. Dorothy also wears a blue velvet gown at home, and Frank has a fetish for blue velvet using it in his perverted sexual games. Blue velvet is a symbol of mystery, obsession and hidden passions lurking beneath the exterior of men.Lynch uses different colors for the scenes taking place in the normal world of American suburbia versus Dorothy's apartment or Ben's house. Lumbertown is depicted as idyllic joyful place with bright yellow tulips against the white fence and bright green grass. Everything involving Dorothy or the criminals is shot either in the darkness or unnaturally striking colors. The director makes an interesting application of the contrast between the two women in protagonist's life. Dangerous and seductive Dorothy is a voluptuous brunette wearing blue or red gowns, whereas Sandy is a slender blonde, your typical American next door cheerleader.Kyle MacLahlan is adorable and gives an incredibly convincing performance. His love-making scenes with Rossellini are tasteful, beautiful and disturbing at the same time. Rosselini was quite adequate, especially if we take into account the complexity of the character, but I couldn't get rid of this thought in the back of my head that Sherilyn Fenn would have been much more memorable. Perhaps, I am irreparably spoiled by Twin Peaks... However, Rossellini's was Lynch's favorite at the time, so we can understand being a little bit biased here. Dennis Hopper is way over the top as Frank Booth, yet still turns in an amazing performance, being psychotic, violent and pitiful at the same time. His every appearance on the screen is a an avalanche of emotions, swear-words and craziness. He is a dangerous man and Jeffrey who stepped in his way knows that the only way for him to stay alive is to eliminate Frank.Lynch decided to end this flick on a joyful note. Everything goes back to normal in Lumberton, Jeffrey and Sandy will probably go on to have a long and wholesome life together with children on the way. Dorothy is hugging her son in the final moments of the movie, and the robin as the symbol of good is devouring the bug just as in Sandy's dream. However, despite the obviously happy ending and triumph of the good over the evil, the final scenes have such a dream-like and surreal quality that one cannot help suspecting that something bad is doomed to happen again. With Lynch you never know for sure... a controversial classic, not to be missed.

A group of concerned officials want to infiltrate an evil mob that sneaks illegal workers from Africa into Europe and treats them like slaves. A timely topic now as well as then. However, having Shaft be the guy to infiltrate was just silly. While the film was set in East Africa, Shaft looks little like one of these people--mostly because almost all Black-Americans trace their ancestry back to West Africa--on the other side of the continent. In addition, he didn't really try to use an appropriate accent throughout the film--only once or twice--and he didn't shave or cut his hair to blend in with the slaves. He simply looked like Richard Roundtree Movie Star amidst the poor unfortunate villagers. Unfortunately, about the only thing going for the film is the action and extreme violence (for 1973). Sadly, even the great tune Shaft was gone and the music was rather bland throughout the film!

In SHAFT'S BIG SCORE, Shaft has a gun battle with about a dozen crooks. They have a machine gun and tons of pistols as well as a helicopter. Shaft has a shotgun and a pistol and manages not only to win but shoot down the copter!!! Sadly, it only got worse in SHAFT IN Africa.The main plot idea isn't bad. A group of concerned officials want to infiltrate an evil mob that sneaks illegal workers from Africa into Europe and treats them like slaves. A timely topic now as well as then. However, having Shaft be the guy to infiltrate was just silly. While the film was set in East Africa, Shaft looks little like one of these people--mostly because almost all Black-Americans trace their ancestry back to West Africa--on the other side of the continent. In addition, he didn't really try to use an appropriate accent throughout the film--only once or twice--and he didn't shave or cut his hair to blend in with the slaves. He simply looked like Richard Roundtree Movie Star amidst the poor unfortunate villagers. Unfortunately, about the only thing going for the film is the action and extreme violence (for 1973). Sadly, even the great tune Shaft was gone and the music was rather bland throughout the film! By the way, although it looked cool, why did Shaft bother to blow up the bunker at the end of the film even though the bad guy and all his men were dead?! It just seemed like a silly excuse for pyrotechnics.

It's not a Coke bottle I refer to, but silent comedy of the Hal Roach and Max Sennett variety, brought to second life by director-writer Jamie Uys.Uys pulls every Roachian trope he can think of, whether it be a terrorist slipping on a banana peel or the strains of Rockabye Baby with people falling asleep. Cars with a mind of their own drive in reverse while one poor fellow can't move five feet in without tripping or getting a face full of flour. Somehow it works, and The Gods Must Be Crazy winds up being a pretty good time.When a Coke bottle is thrown out of a passing airplane and lands amid a tribe of Ju\/wasi (also known, apparently not as respectfully I've learned, as Bushmen), the strange object is found so useful that it stirs up jealousy and unrest. Thinking it a gift from the Gods, a most unwelcome one, a tribe member named Xi (N!xau, a real Ju\/wasi) sets off to find the end of the earth so he can respectfully return it. On his way, he runs afoul of civilization's mad rules and finds himself in need of help from mechanic M'Pudi (Louw Verway) and biologist Andrew Steyn (Marius Weyers, the guy with the flour on his face). Steyn's got his own problems.When I meet women, my brain switches off, Steyn explains. I turn into a complete idiot. When escorting the fair schoolteacher Kate (Sandra Prinsloo) to a Botswana village, he keeps falling on top of her trying to rescue her from wild animals only he (and the audience) sees. You get these sudden urges and then you come up with warthogs and rhinoceroses, she sneers.There are those who see in Gods socio-political comment about the then state of South Africa, where the film was made, with blacks and whites adjusting to one another in chaotic fashion. Others may see a comic Koyaanisqatsi, of life's balance being restored by Xi, the only true-sighted man amid many who are confused. But the film plays so hard for laughs it feels chary to look past the slapstick surface for anything more than a funny story.In fact, I think it works against the film to attach too much thought to watching it. Clearly there's a bit of awkwardness to the notion of the Ju\/wasi lifestyle being presented so idyllically, as if subsisting on rainwater residue really compensates for adequate refreshment. The sad fate of N!xau, who lived out his days a wretched shell from tuberculosis, suggests a more uncomfortable reality than presented here.But the film impresses me with its winning amiability and clever set-ups, the way Uys never lets a scene go more than a minute without finding some amusing payoff. Even a gang of terrorists shooting up the countryside, actually killing and being killed, feel more in tune with Laurel & Hardy than The Dogs Of War. Uys is merely updating the movie conventions to more modern sensibilities, without losing the mojo that made classic comedies so rich and lasting. Despite some atrocious dubbing, there is even some good wordplay to be had. I like especially the name of Steyn's romantic rival, Jack Hind, as I realized it must be a play on the classic Jack Ass.Okay, maybe the charm wears off a bit after the credits roll. You couldn't really make films like silent Hollywood did, not in 1980 and especially perhaps not in a part of the world as hard-bitten by life's realities as southern Africa. But The Gods Must Be Crazy comes pretty close, and when you add some of the most gorgeous scenery ever filmed, it makes for a more fulfilling entertainment than most of today's more socially relevant comedies while it runs its mad, inspired course.

The last time I saw it was 10 years ago and today I enjoyed it just as much. Heckerling's adaptation of Jane Austen's 'Emma' may appear like a fluffy teen flick on the surface but there is a lot more to it. It works on multiple levels and 'Clueless', in a way, is a social commentary as it reflects a reality that still exists in today's society. First of all, the teen life is very realistically portrayed albeit with a sarcastic tone (such as the striving for high grades, obsession with image and partying). It somewhat reminds me of 'Heathers' (another excellent teen satire). While 'Heathers' is a much darker film that looks at teens in the 1980s, 'Clueless' looks at the adolescents of the 90s. Moreover, Heckerling brilliantly uses different kid of comedies through one-liner and dialogue, situational, and slap stick.Then the class distinction too is cleverly demonstrated through the eyes of Cher. The characters too work on multiple levels. Cher appears to be a popular stuckup bimbo type lass but once Hecklerling allows us to dig a little deeper, we see that she is unintentionally manipulative and knows how to use her strength (her power of persuasion). Yet, she is good at heart and even though her initial intentions of getting the two teacher together was to get an A grade, she's happy with the outcome of her matchmaking and the acts that follow are with more sincere purpose. Tai too appears to be the dumb new girl but she is far more experienced than Cher and when opportunity strikes she makes a place for herself in 'society' (i.e, highschool).Alicia Silverstone plays the part as though it was made for her. She has the right looks, age, excellent dialogue delivery and is a total natural in performing. 'Clueless' was the film that made her an overnight star and a very promising actress however, unfortunately, her following movies have been disastrous and the actress rapidly vanished into oblivion. She is supported by an equally great cast that includes a goofy Breckin Meyer, a weirdly fashioned but still gorgeous Stacy Dash, a naive Brittany Murphy, a laidback Paul Rudd, a hilarious Donald Faison, a bitchy Elisa Donovan and a fire breathing Dan Hedaya.For me 'Clueless' is among the top teen films along with movies like 'Heathers'. Those who childishly dismiss it as a fluffy chick-flick don't know what they missed. I was watching '10 Things I Hate About You' which is an adaptation of Shakespeare's 'The Taming Of Thew Shrew' and while that film failed to engage me for the most parts, 'Clueless' succeeds in all departments because it's much more than just another teen flick.

It is where the boat moored after Permanent Vacation, so it is out of the same universe, the same general headspace, but in a different country, a new world.I'll recount a part of the story, because I liked it.Willie lives in Purgatory, somewhere in New York. He comes from Hungary, but suppresses his European heritage under a facade of hip film-noir Americanism. His cousin, Eva (the femme fatale if we see it as noir), who has just arrived in America from Budapest, blows into his life like bad news from an Aunt Lotte in Cleveland. Willie is forced to 'babysit' Eva while his aunt stays in hospital for 10 days. He is aggrieved by this disruption to his life, even though TV dinners, games of solitaire, and long sleeps are about the only things to disrupt.Willie's small, dour apartment holes them up for the duration like the prison in Down By Law. Their time together is uneventful in the large, but very frank in revealing the slow time ordinariness and emotional seclusion of Willie's life. He bans Eva from speaking in Hungarian even though he knows the language, he forbids her from answering his phone, prohibits her from going anywhere with him, presumably because it would contradict the barricade of his cool, noirish, self-image, and impatiently attempts to educate her in Americanisms he barely understands himself. Their only interruption from themselves or each other is a visit from Willie's gambling buddy, Eddie, whose warm and polite attempts to include Eva in their adventures outside are upset by his deference to Willie's personality. When it comes time for Eva to leave for Cleveland, Willie has acted upon a bud of affection but can only express it in jaded terms. He insists Eva wear a dress he bought for her, even though she doesn't like it, because she should dress like an American when she is in America.This is where the first part ends, or nearly. On the street, after Eva and Willie have exchanged goodbyes, Eddie finds Eva abandoning the dress that Willie bought as a gift. Eddie does not mention this to Willie, presumably because he does not want to hurt his feelings. It is all unspoken. Willie and Eddie sit and drink beer, both reflect on Eva's visit without speaking.Originally, the film ends here. It was shot using leftover film from Wim Wenders' The State of Things.

It is an action film, but its definition of action is subtle and internal, left to the sensitivities of the watcher to engage with. The weather is a strong and active force, negotiating the lives of the characters like another character. This, I guess, has something to do with Ozu, mentioned by Eddie in his reference to Tokyo Story as the horse to back while he reads Willie the odds.Jarmusch has been strongly influenced by and is educated in World cinema, establishing him as a kind of outsider at home, just like the characters. The film with its surface deadpan, hangs back from the perspectives of its characters in a kind of suspended relativism, which is throughout all of Jarmusch's work.

A film noir protagonist's end always reflects on their preceding actions.Watch it if you haven't, watch it again if you have, or don't watch it. But it would surely fit any worthwhile definition of a 'good' film. ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"11 August 2008","score":"","review":" In the early seventies the West went through a period of fascination with the Chinese martial arts. (I use that term as it is the one Westerners are most familiar with, although I am aware that some Chinese, my wife included, dislike it as sounding too aggressive and militaristic; they prefer the term art of self-defence). There was a popular TV series called Kung Fu, a cartoon called Hong Kong Phooey (which featured a martial-arts dog) and even a pop song called Kung Fu Fighting. In fact, it was a little bit frightening! The whole cult was memorably sent up by The Goodies, a British comedy team, as Ecky-Thump, a Lancashire martial art which involves beating people over the head with a black pudding.At the centre of the Kung-Fu cult was the actor Bruce Lee, a household name in both Britain and America even though he made few English-language movies. Lee was born in San Francisco, a city which is home to a large Chinese community and also produced the best-known Chinese-American film star, Anna May Wong. His family went back to Hong Kong while he was a child, but he returned to America in his teens, and went on to become a leading expert in, and teacher of, the martial arts. He became an actor on both sides of the Pacific, making martial-arts films and television series in both Hong Kong and America. His best-known American venture was the TV series The Green Hornet in which he played the role of Kato. His last, and best-known, film was Enter the Dragon, filmed in English in Hong Kong, completed just before Lee's tragically early death at the age of 33.It is a common convention in showbiz biopics that success doesn't come easily. The star can only get to the top by battling either external forces or internal demons. Or in this case, both. In this film the external force which threatens Lee is that of racism. In the sixties and seventies there was widespread discrimination against Chinese-Americans, and Asian-Americans in general; in an early scene Lee is appalled by Mickey Rooney's patronising portrayal of a Japanese in Breakfast at Tiffany's. This discrimination affected Lee's career; he was originally to have been the star of the Kung Fu TV series, but television executives did not want an Asian actor in the leading role, so the character became mixed-race and a white actor, David Carradine, was cast in the part. Lee also faced racism in his personal life; in the film his future mother-in-law strongly opposes his marriage to her daughter on the grounds that she does not want yellow grandchildren. (Lee was married to a white woman). Of course, racism can be a two-way street, and we also see how Lee faced opposition from conservative elements in the Chinese-American community who objected to him teaching fighting skills to white and black Americans.As for Lee's internal demons, the film-makers seem to have interpreted the word demon absolutely literally. He is shown having recurrent nightmares in which he has to do combat with a mysterious armoured figure. Although this demon can be interpreted symbolically as a representation of negative emotions such as fear and anger, there are also hints that Lee actually had to battle against hostile supernatural forces.Jason Scott Lee (no relation) makes a convincing hero, but the film's main weakness is that it is never sure what attitude to take towards its hero. The tone of the fight scenes, especially in the early part of the film, is often jokey, reminiscent of the fights in a Jackie Chan comedy. This light, comedic tone, however, does not sit well with the more reverential attitude of the later scenes. Lee's mysterious death is not dwelt on; instead, the film ends with a voice-over in which the actress playing his wife Linda announces- There are many people that want to know the way he died. I want to remember the way he lived. The film clearly intends that we should remember Lee not only as a good man but also as an international cultural icon of lasting significance and a figure who played a major part in combating prejudice against Asian-Americans.Certainly, American society has become less racist, both towards Chinese-Americans and towards other ethnic minorities, since 1973; for example, Barack Obama's candidacy for the Presidency would have been virtually unthinkable 35 years ago. Whether one lone film star played much of a part in that change is debatable; the fact that Lee lost a major role to a white actor only a year before his death suggests that he did not make much headway in his lifetime. Even today, there are relatively few well-known Asian-American stars in the entertainment industry. Whether one considers Bruce Lee as a cultural icon of lasting significance largely depends on one's view of martial-arts based entertainment. Dragon is entertaining, both as an action film, and as a biography, but I felt it never quite justified the claims it made on behalf of its subject. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 August 2008","score":"","review":" In the early seventies the West went through a period of fascination with the Chinese martial arts.
