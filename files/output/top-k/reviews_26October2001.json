For one thing, it could have used a little more development regarding Princess Pei Pei's motivation for fleeing her country.  It's kind of hard to care terribly much about a Princess who abandons her position, country, and family just for a lark.  It's not as if she's just taking the night off (Roman Holiday).  She's gone and she isn't coming back.  I guess we're just supposed to cheer her for heroic individuality.However, once Owen and Jackie are official partners, things pick up and don't let up.  Unlike most comedies, this one doesn't poop out.  Most comedies end with an almost entirely laughless twenty minutes as the plot or the message or both are given perfunctory notice (Tommy Boy, Strange Brew, etc.)  That's where Shanghai Noon has the action\/adventure\/western thing going for it. Stretching the genre quite a bit, it's fun and funny and even a little sweet.  That shouldn't be a surprise since it stars Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan (two terribly endearing guys).  Owen gives us more of his `outlaw with a heart' schtick (ala `Bottle Rocket').  His quirky, sensitive, introspective, garrulous cowboy is a delight to see and hear (especially in the middle of the movie when he and Jackie are imprisoned and when he's showing Jackie the ropes of being a cowboy).      Jackie gives us more of his butt-kicker with a heart (owing more to Chaplin than Lee) as usual.  He fights the baddies with just about everything imaginable a horse-shoe tied to a rope, elk horns, his ponytail, baby pines, a revolving mirror, a giant bell, a basket, and even a sheriff's badge (used as a Ninja star).  At one point Owen says to Jackie, &#133;when I look at you there's something different about you and I can see it.  I can see it in your eyes.  This is true of both these characters and these actors.Finally, (to its detriment) this flick takes deus-ex-machina to a new level.  It seems the action can't progress for fifteen minutes with some outside, unexpected rescue (and it's always just in the nick of time).  The prison break is thanks to Jackie's unwanted Indian bride (who we haven't seen for the last fifteen minutes).  She also rescues them from being hanged.

Not as `Poe-etic' maybe but just as grim and fateful in its intent was 1963's hotly anticipated `The Birds,' loosely based on the1952 Daphne Du Maurier Gothic-styled novella (originally set on a post-WWII English coast).  Alfred Hitchcock had faithful fans scurrying to the theater houses in droves for his first feature in three years following his macabre masterpiece `Psycho.'  In between, Hitch launched his celebrated TV anthology series, winning a whole new generation of admirers.By altering the image of our fair, feathered friends from symbols of peace, freedom and paradise into terrifying tools of terror, Hitch once again assaulted our eyes and ears in a fresh, cleverly laid out manner.  Flocks of birds of varying species descend upon a small California coastal town and attack without provocation, turning into Armageddon-like messengers of doom and annihilation.  It was an ingenious &#145;comeback&#145; idea and Hitch did not disappoint.  I can't recall an earlier movie that so rerouted a creature as sweet and innocent as a sparrow.Since `Psycho' put the `H' in (modern) Horror, what could we expect from `The Birds' on its initial release?  Would this heroine too meet an early, similar fate ála Janet Leigh?  Would she be beaked to death before the end of the first reel?  What would the gore factor be now that `Psycho' had opened Hollywood's bloody doors?  Unmercifully playful as always and a master of pre-show suspense, Hitch released his birds with tremendous fanfare and, of course, made quite an impact.  The movie became the prototype for a stream of `nature's revenge' movies involving unlikely human predators &#150; ants, frogs, rabbits, and the like.The characters in `Psycho' and `The Birds' are similar in their presentation.  They are chilly, not easily embraced, hardly flesh-and-blood characters.  They appear to be mere instruments to present, not distract from, the ultimate horrific elements, and yet they becoming more fascinating with each repeated viewing.Over the years Hitch had a penchant for taking beautiful, sometimes limited, well-coiffed blonde actresses and turning them into exquisite mysteries. Kim Novak of `Vertigo' comes foremost to mind.  Here, Tippi Hedren provides one of the most vexing, deceptively intriguing characters yet.  A coy, superficial, self-indulgent socialite whose reckless, news-making escapades has been front-page tabloid material, Melanie Daniels, one day at a pet shop, happens to meet and fix upon Mitch Brenner, an assertive, strapping, hirsutely handsome &#145;nice guy' attorney (Rod Taylor), totally out of her league, yet a down-home charmer just the same.  A casual but obvious flirtation filters out between the two.  The capricious lady proceeds to drive all the way to the isolated little town of Bodega Bay to sneak a pair of lovebirds, into Mitch's mother's home for his much, much younger sister's (Veronica Cartwright, by at least 20 years!) birthday.  Hedren is a cool but captivating young heroine who gets to thaw out a little as the film progresses.  The other roles are handled just as professionally.Rod Taylor (`The Time Machine') is a definitive man's man and an ingratiating ladies' man to boot.  Doling out steadfast, unflinching heroes most his career, he has that fine reputation as a protector extraordinaire, and though he remained in the second ranks for the long duration, his wry charm, stocky masculinity and sexy banter has always been first rate with me.  His Mitch Brenner may still be caught up in his mother's apron strings a bit, but on him it looks honorable, not emasculating.The always wonderful Jessica Tandy returned to the cinematic fold after a decade of stage and TV work as Mrs. Brenner.  A wan, high-strung, overly possessive widow incapacitated over the years by fear and anxiety, her desperate attachment to her son was sure to discourage any female competitor.  Tandy's performance bears close attention.  She draws out a subtle flurry of emotions in what at first might appear to be a one-note performance, drawing sympathy in spite of her limitations.Lovely Suzanne Pleshette, in a rare, dressed-down support role, gives one of the more curious performances of the film.  As the insular, cynical school teacher Annie Hayworth, she inspires genuine empathy as a young woman mysteriously bitter and broken in spirit for such a young age.  Once in love with Mitch until Mrs. Brenner's interference, she strangely hangs around as a friend, yearning maybe for a reconciliation.  Despite her obvious beauty and intelligence, she has consigned herself to living a small-town life of boredom, broken dreams, and ultimate loneliness.  Ironically, it is she, the self-appointed spinster, who makes the ultimate mother's sacrifice &#150; protecting her `children' at all costs.A number of familiar faces, if not names, flutter about as well  Ethel Griffies as an ornithological expert, Lonny Chapman as a restaurant operator, comedian Doodles Weaver (uncle of Sigourney) as a boatman, Ruth McDevitt, flighty as always, as a pet shop owner, Richard (`The Dick Van Dyke Show') Deacon as Mitch's dour city neighbor, and, with a keen eye, little Morgan Brittany can be glimpsed as one of the terrified schoolgirls. Of course, there is a bit of fun to be had trying to spot Hitch himself, whose trademark cameo appearance comes early in the film.As in all of Hitch's films, the successful buildup of suspense is done in a myriad of ways.  Nobody works a camera like the master.  Slightly distorted angles accentuate the character's imbalance and gathering paranoia.  Even something as unvarnished as Hedren's little boat trek across the lake offers a moving camera that taunts with eery tension.  The absence of a screechy Bernard Herrman score, using this time only the intermittent chirping and cawing of his foul fowl, enhances the feelings of isolation and vulnerability.  Classic &#145;terror' scenes here include Hedren's school bench sequence in which clusters of crows furtively take over a school playground; Tandy's slow discovery of a neighbor's grisly attack; and Hedren's claustrophobic telephone booth assault -- all indelible visions long after the finale.Metaphorically speaking , the outcome is purposely left `up in the air' &#150; which, I suppose, is relatively germane to the world-threatening conflicts of today.

Not as `Poe-etic' maybe but just as grim and fateful in its intent was 1963's hotly anticipated `The Birds,' loosely based on the1952 Daphne Du Maurier Gothic-styled novella (originally set on a post-WWII English coast).  Alfred Hitchcock had faithful fans scurrying to the theater houses in droves for his first feature in three years following his macabre masterpiece `Psycho.'  In between, Hitch launched his celebrated TV anthology series, winning a whole new generation of admirers.By altering the image of our fair, feathered friends from symbols of peace, freedom and paradise into terrifying tools of terror, Hitch once again assaulted our eyes and ears in a fresh, cleverly laid out manner.  Flocks of birds of varying species descend upon a small California coastal town and attack without provocation, turning into Armageddon-like messengers of doom and annihilation.  It was an ingenious &#145;comeback&#145; idea and Hitch did not disappoint.  I can't recall an earlier movie that so rerouted a creature as sweet and innocent as a sparrow.Since `Psycho' put the `H' in (modern) Horror, what could we expect from `The Birds' on its initial release?  Would this heroine too meet an early, similar fate ála Janet Leigh?  Would she be beaked to death before the end of the first reel?  What would the gore factor be now that `Psycho' had opened Hollywood's bloody doors?  Unmercifully playful as always and a master of pre-show suspense, Hitch released his birds with tremendous fanfare and, of course, made quite an impact.  The movie became the prototype for a stream of `nature's revenge' movies involving unlikely human predators &#150; ants, frogs, rabbits, and the like.The characters in `Psycho' and `The Birds' are similar in their presentation.  They are chilly, not easily embraced, hardly flesh-and-blood characters.  They appear to be mere instruments to present, not distract from, the ultimate horrific elements, and yet they becoming more fascinating with each repeated viewing.Over the years Hitch had a penchant for taking beautiful, sometimes limited, well-coiffed blonde actresses and turning them into exquisite mysteries. Kim Novak of `Vertigo' comes foremost to mind.  Here, Tippi Hedren provides one of the most vexing, deceptively intriguing characters yet.  A coy, superficial, self-indulgent socialite whose reckless, news-making escapades has been front-page tabloid material, Melanie Daniels, one day at a pet shop, happens to meet and fix upon Mitch Brenner, an assertive, strapping, hirsutely handsome &#145;nice guy' attorney (Rod Taylor), totally out of her league, yet a down-home charmer just the same.  A casual but obvious flirtation filters out between the two.  The capricious lady proceeds to drive all the way to the isolated little town of Bodega Bay to sneak a pair of lovebirds, into Mitch's mother's home for his much, much younger sister's (Veronica Cartwright, by at least 20 years!) birthday.  Hedren is a cool but captivating young heroine who gets to thaw out a little as the film progresses.  The other roles are handled just as professionally.Rod Taylor (`The Time Machine') is a definitive man's man and an ingratiating ladies' man to boot.  Doling out steadfast, unflinching heroes most his career, he has that fine reputation as a protector extraordinaire, and though he remained in the second ranks for the long duration, his wry charm, stocky masculinity and sexy banter has always been first rate with me.  His Mitch Brenner may still be caught up in his mother's apron strings a bit, but on him it looks honorable, not emasculating.The always wonderful Jessica Tandy returned to the cinematic fold after a decade of stage and TV work as Mrs. Brenner.  A wan, high-strung, overly possessive widow incapacitated over the years by fear and anxiety, her desperate attachment to her son was sure to discourage any female competitor.  Tandy's performance bears close attention.  She draws out a subtle flurry of emotions in what at first might appear to be a one-note performance, drawing sympathy in spite of her limitations.Lovely Suzanne Pleshette, in a rare, dressed-down support role, gives one of the more curious performances of the film.  As the insular, cynical school teacher Annie Hayworth, she inspires genuine empathy as a young woman mysteriously bitter and broken in spirit for such a young age.  Once in love with Mitch until Mrs. Brenner's interference, she strangely hangs around as a friend, yearning maybe for a reconciliation.  Despite her obvious beauty and intelligence, she has consigned herself to living a small-town life of boredom, broken dreams, and ultimate loneliness.  Ironically, it is she, the self-appointed spinster, who makes the ultimate mother's sacrifice &#150; protecting her `children' at all costs.A number of familiar faces, if not names, flutter about as well  Ethel Griffies as an ornithological expert, Lonny Chapman as a restaurant operator, comedian Doodles Weaver (uncle of Sigourney) as a boatman, Ruth McDevitt, flighty as always, as a pet shop owner, Richard (`The Dick Van Dyke Show') Deacon as Mitch's dour city neighbor, and, with a keen eye, little Morgan Brittany can be glimpsed as one of the terrified schoolgirls. Of course, there is a bit of fun to be had trying to spot Hitch himself, whose trademark cameo appearance comes early in the film.As in all of Hitch's films, the successful buildup of suspense is done in a myriad of ways.  Nobody works a camera like the master.  Slightly distorted angles accentuate the character's imbalance and gathering paranoia.  Even something as unvarnished as Hedren's little boat trek across the lake offers a moving camera that taunts with eery tension.  The absence of a screechy Bernard Herrman score, using this time only the intermittent chirping and cawing of his foul fowl, enhances the feelings of isolation and vulnerability.  Classic &#145;terror' scenes here include Hedren's school bench sequence in which clusters of crows furtively take over a school playground; Tandy's slow discovery of a neighbor's grisly attack; and Hedren's claustrophobic telephone booth assault -- all indelible visions long after the finale.Metaphorically speaking , the outcome is purposely left `up in the air' &#150; which, I suppose, is relatively germane to the world-threatening conflicts of today.  Hitch's film projects may be designed for escape but he has a knack for making them seem awfully real.  First shower-taking, now bird-watching.  He has a devilish habit of taking the fun out of life's little pleasures, doesn't he?.

I'm not sure which ones were scarier, the noisy ones like The Juggernaut, The Hammer and The Jackal or the quietly threatening ones like The Angry Princess, The Great Child and The First Born Son.  The make-up, set design and effects crews did an amazingly outstanding job; I have never seen anything like this before. The sound effects were perfect from the grinding gears to the ghostly murmurings. I have seen the original 13 Ghosts movie complete with Illusion-O! effects on DVD and it was gloriously cheesy, William Castle made scary movies for fun, they were meant to be fun and the remake is no different in that respect; it is a fun movie, complete immersion in sights and sounds. This version kept the number of ghosts, the general foundational premise and both movies are loaded with tongue in cheek references and humor but that is where the two films part company, as they should, they were created 41 years apart so of course the remake should take advantage of the advances in film technology.  I really enjoyed this movie, I wish it had been a bit longer, spent a little more time on the background of those incredibly angry ghosts, fleshed out the living characters just a bit more, perhaps moved just a little bit slower but then, the fast-paced frenetic energy and aural\/visual stimulation of the movie is what kept my eyes glued to the screen.

","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"26 October 2001","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  On May 1999, I read on a Spanish specialized magazine some info about a sci-fi that was cracking the US box-office. It was the second film of the Wachowski Bros., unknown at that time, and Keanu Reeves starred. It included some amazing photos, but it reminded me of another Reeves' movie, Johnny Mnemonic a sci-fi with a good premise and presentation, but irregular and not very hooking...That film, however, had the abstract and yet attractive name of The Matrix. And it had to have something special to smash the box-office so heavily.July came, and I discovered that you mustn't make any judgments or comments about something you know very little or nothing about. Because after watching this movie, I just couldn't believe what I had just seen.After having watched the film almost 15 times, I can list all the excellent aspects of The Matrix, but the plot and the Visual FX (Oscar) obviously outstand. And it is after watching the Wachowski's first movie, Bound, that you can explain many things.These brothers really have a lot of talent. They have kept the style of their debut in The Matrix, but, what's best, it is a style that's easily distinguishable. A sophisticated directing, in which cinematography is their best support. The film is actually decolored, and that matches perfectly with the film's spirit. But also their conception of thrilling stories with a touch of film-noir, that make the viewer think and wonder about the plot or message. I came out of this film with a certain paranoia, asking myself if this apparent reality is not what we think it is.And I OBVIOUSLY know it is only fantasy, but that's one of the successes of the film transport the viewer, and activating his brain to think for once in his life about what a film can tell us, developing in some way our imagination and getting him away from this world for at least a few minutes.That's what's sci-fi all's about making us think in what we know it is not real... or it's still not real. And this film can conceive hundreds of ideas and thoughts in our heads, which would be impossible to list. At least mine's...The script as I said is original and polished, and containing its correct doses of action sequences and, what's best, a great majestic ending as I hadn't seen in many years. I'm not telling nothing about the plot because I hate spoilers (I don't want to be one), but trust me if I say it's amazing and incredible. The film keeps an excellent rhythm thanks to the Oscarized editing. There's an excellent, superb example of editing that maybe most of you haven't really recognized the bomb arming sequence. That's editing made art. And you can see there is a good production design for the whole lot.The directors make their part then, and also the actors do. Because unlike many other supposed great production films, such as Lost In Space, in which actors are secondary, here they don't get absorbed and wiped out by the Visual FX department. Keanu Reeves may be considered by many people as a cold actor, but that's just because he doesn't fit in many comic or romantic roles he's played since Speed he's a natural born action actor. And in The Matrix he does quite a very good job indeed as Neo. But the best is Laurence Fishburne, giving Morpheus all throughout the film the mystery, patience and wisdom that surrounds the role since the start, when he's just known as a myth. Other characters are OK, but I want to remark Joe Pantoliano's job (haha, been naughty as usual!).About FX... I am a great Star Wars fan, and The Phantom Menace and The Matrix were nominated both for 1999's best FX. However, I wanted the second one to win (another Oscar), because of their innovation and originality. Fantastic. How could someone ever imagine a man dodging bullets? Wow... The greatest thing about them is what I said before they don't overtake the whole film, they INTEGRATE in the story, they are necessary for the plot to progress and transmit the story. The action sequences (the kung-fu training, the Hall cross-fire, the heli blast...) are superbly sequenced and and are massive. Please don't watch the film on full screen get the Widescreen version or don't watch it.

And this film can conceive hundreds of ideas and thoughts in our heads, which would be impossible to list. At least mine's...The script as I said is original and polished, and containing its correct doses of action sequences and, what's best, a great majestic ending as I hadn't seen in many years. I'm not telling nothing about the plot because I hate spoilers (I don't want to be one), but trust me if I say it's amazing and incredible. The film keeps an excellent rhythm thanks to the Oscarized editing. There's an excellent, superb example of editing that maybe most of you haven't really recognized the bomb arming sequence. That's editing made art. And you can see there is a good production design for the whole lot.The directors make their part then, and also the actors do. Because unlike many other supposed great production films, such as Lost In Space, in which actors are secondary, here they don't get absorbed and wiped out by the Visual FX department. Keanu Reeves may be considered by many people as a cold actor, but that's just because he doesn't fit in many comic or romantic roles he's played since Speed he's a natural born action actor. And in The Matrix he does quite a very good job indeed as Neo. But the best is Laurence Fishburne, giving Morpheus all throughout the film the mystery, patience and wisdom that surrounds the role since the start, when he's just known as a myth. Other characters are OK, but I want to remark Joe Pantoliano's job (haha, been naughty as usual!).About FX... I am a great Star Wars fan, and The Phantom Menace and The Matrix were nominated both for 1999's best FX. However, I wanted the second one to win (another Oscar), because of their innovation and originality. Fantastic. How could someone ever imagine a man dodging bullets? Wow... The greatest thing about them is what I said before they don't overtake the whole film, they INTEGRATE in the story, they are necessary for the plot to progress and transmit the story.

Fargo is one of my toppicks any day of the week, and O Brother Where Art Thou? was inmy 10 Best of 2000 list. Although I love everything the C-Bros do, I don't always love it rightaway. I remember being disappointed by The Big Lebowski whenit first hit theatres. I don't know what I was expecting, but whatever itwas, The Big Lebowski wasn't it. After some time went by, I caughtit again on cable -- and loved it! I've seen it several times now, andown it on video (still working on the DVD collection...).While I can't say I dislike The Man Who Wasn't There, I'm notinstantly loving it, either. It's a good movie; well-acted, well-written,well-directed, well-photographed... but, well, a bit dull. While themovie played, I found myself fidgeting, wondering what time it was,thinking about tomorrow's plans, and so on. That's never a goodsign. But you might catch me six months from now, I'll have seen itagain and wonder what the heck was I thinking when I gave it thismarginal review.Presented entirely in black and white, The Man Who Wasn't Thereis Joel and Ethan's homage to film noir. Set in the mid-1940s, theplot focuses on a morose barber, Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton,Bandits), and his upwardly mobile, fashion-conscious wife, Doris(Frances McDormand, Almost Famous).

It's a good movie; well-acted, well-written,well-directed, well-photographed... but, well, a bit dull.
