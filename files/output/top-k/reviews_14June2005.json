[{"date":"14 June 2005","score":"","review":" Rounders is both a sleeper hit and a cult poker movie. This movie hit well before the poker phenomenon hit prime time cable TV. With great casting likes of Matt Damon, Ed Norton, John Tortoru, and John Malkevich it is hard to go wrong. The movie tells the story of Rounders(Professional Poker Players) and there saga of up-and-down poker games.I recommend this film for anyone who wants a taste of poker playing and\/or a view of how poker games are sweeping the USA and want to know why college kids have left college for a life of cards. This is the movie, it catches the dream, the vision, and the bleak reality. Let me not forget a good script and some great acting on the part of Rounders aka Best Of the Poker Playing Movie of all-time.
