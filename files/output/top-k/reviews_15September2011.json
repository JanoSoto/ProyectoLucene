Over the years you can see an evolution in how Hollywood has treated the problem of drink as sensibilities have changed. DW Griffith's The Struggle in 1931 was a nice try but appallingly poor taste, with am unconvincing, comedy drunk act. The Long Weekend (1945) went for harrowing realism and was for the most part effective, but it fell at the last hurdle and ended up being the very thing it tried not to be &#x96; a surreal melodrama that was unintentionally comical. Days of Wine and Roses however avoids this trap by being mostly realistic, whilst adding a light a sprinkling of comedy to offset the serious moments and make the tragedy run deeper.Days of Wine and Roses is rarely laugh-out-loud funny, but the first half-hour or so has a light air of irreverence. The JP Miller screenplay gives us dialogue that really sparkles with both wit and familiarity. Take for example the Corporation x conversation between Jack Lemmon and Charles Bickford. It's vaguely humorous but also a credible of the kind of talks people have, and gives us a concise and engaging introduction to Bickford's character. It's also important exchanges like this actually have nothing to do with alcoholism, they are just building layers of reality and interest to give the main story its human backdrop.Miller's words are brought to life by a note-perfect cast. Jack Lemmon's performance has a slight comic edge to it, without quite being the comic-relief drunk act. He has a hint of silliness about him even when he is sober and the implication is that he has a rather crazy personality which gets exaggerated when he drinks. It works very well. Co-star Lee Remick matches and if anything surpasses him. Her portrayal of drunkenness is more realistic; appropriate because her story is really the more tragic. Charles Bickford and Jack Klugman give some perspective with two powerful &#x96; but very different &#x96; performances which are completely sober and serious. In Bickford's case it's one of the last of an incredible career, in Klugman's one of the few opportunities he really got to shine.Director Blake Edwards was a minimalist when it came to style and technique, keeping things simple to focus us on the performances. That's not to say he can't do some clever visual arrangements. One of his trademarks is the party scene, and the example here is realistic, vibrant, but never enough to upstage the characters in the foreground. In most scenes Edwards keeps his camera fixed and pans to follow the actors as they caper about, making the backgrounds a blur but the characters continually in our attention. He often lets the players take their time over a scene, allowing for moments of contemplation or protracted outbursts. The greenhouse scene is a real masterstroke. We know exactly how this one is going to pan out, and we feel powerless as it unfolds before us with painful slowness.Of course, the origin of such powerful moments is JP Miller's screenplay, his structuring and clever little vignettes. Which leads me onto one final point that makes Days of Wine and Roses stand out above its predecessors. This picture takes the step The Lost Weekend didn't dare to. It refuses to give us a happy ending, and instead leaves the story hovering in ambiguity. Why is this so important? Quite simply we could not accept it. We know Joe has already recovered and relapsed several, and his happily-ever-after is not guaranteed.

He is, however, one of the few modern directors with a taste for the grand epic manner, evidenced by films like Glory and The Last Samurai which show the influence of earlier directors like David Lean and William Wyler.Legends of the Fall is another epic drama in the same vein. Like the more recent There Will Be Blood it can be seen as falling within the Western tradition, although it is not normally described as a Western. Apart from the final scene, which is set in 1963, the action takes place during the years 1910s, 1920s and 1930s, and centres upon the Ludlow family of Montana. The family patriarch is the Cornish-born Colonel William Ludlow. Ludlow served with distinction in the US Army for many years, but has become disillusioned with war after seeing atrocities committed by troops against the Native American population. He has become not only a pacifist but also something of an anarchist who distrusts all governments and their works. He has come to admire the Native American peoples and the film is narrated by his friend One Stab, a member of the Cree nation.Central to the plot is that Ludlow's three sons, Alfred, Tristan, and Samuel, all fall in love with the same woman, Susannah Fincannon. Susannah is originally the fiancée of the youngest son, Samuel, but their romance is interrupted when he and his two brothers (much to their father's displeasure) all go off to fight in World War I. The old man's displeasure is increased by the fact that, because America is still neutral, they are not obliged to fight, but volunteer to join the Canadian Army to aid Britain in her fight against Germany. Samuel is killed in action, and when Alfred and Tristan return home both fall in love with Susannah.The two men are very different in character. The cautious, conformist Alfred goes into politics, becoming a member of first the Montana state legislature and then of the US Congress. Tristan, by contrast, is a wild, rebellious free spirit, but haunted by guilt over what he sees as his failure to protect Samuel during the war. He roams the world before becoming a bootlegger during the Prohibition era. Susannah and Tristan become lovers for a time, but their relationship is a doomed one, and she eventually marries Alfred. (It is perhaps significant that Tristan is named after the hero of a romance about doomed love).There are two particularly good acting performances. One comes from the normally excellent Anthony Hopkins as the ageing Colonel; the other from Brad Pitt as Tristan. Pitt is not always my favourite actor. In his more commercial ventures such as Troy, Mr and Mrs Smith and the Ocean's franchise he often seems content just to stroll his way through the movie without putting in any real effort. Give him a more challenging role, however, and he often rises to the challenge, as in Fight Club and Babel. Here as Tristan he brings a passionate intensity, as well as a suggestion of an underlying unhappiness to the role. Julia Ormond may have largely disappeared from sight since 1994, but here as Susannah (her first major starring role) she does enough to show just why she was regarded as one of the rising young stars of the mid-nineties.The film has its faults; it is overlong, at times moves too slowly and the plot, which is considerably more complex than my brief summary above might suggest, is a loose, sprawling one which does not always hang together well. And yet, despite its flaws, it is a film one can admire for its ambition. The photography, especially of the Montana landscapes is striking; the Academy Award for Best Cinematography was well-deserved.

Yet, there's something more appealing in Love and Death, a sort of endearing quality in the main character, Sergei Dimitriovitch, brilliantly portrayed by Woody Allen supported by a superb performance from Diane Keaton as the delicious, frivolous and voluptuous Sonja. I never thought Kay Adams could be so damn sex... I mean, funny.Sure, Woody plays the usual neurotic and tormented character but combined with the period setting and the picaresque narrative, it immediately provides a hilarious twist. He's insecure, weak, short, ugly, in a way, he makes us feel superior or luckier, but as the movie progresses, and as we get deeper in his subconscious, we're contaminated by his endless questionings about the meaning of life. Woody Allen's Love and Death takes very seriously the humor it uses to make fun of seriousness, and the inner intelligence of the film relies on the level of absurdity it shamelessly reaches while tackling metaphysical subjects such as love, death, life, sex, and turning them into the most pleonastic derision. Ultimately, Woody Allen's epic period masterpiece resonates as the triumphant intellectual demonstration that life is damn too serious to be taken seriously, life is about living, enjoying, having fun, sex&#x85; Disguised in cowardice and refusal to make war, Sergei's approach is in fact more hedonistic and inspirational in its intelligent demonstration that even for the average schmuck, the greatest things can work out of a misunderstanding!But misunderstanding implies the use of intelligence, and if there's no better comedy than a comedy with a heart, there's no funnier comedy that one with intelligence. And the mightiest power of intelligence relies on its capacity to exceed its idiomatic limits and idiotic means to defy the great law that defines our existence absurdity. Love and Death echoes the philosophical condition of our limited intelligence that can only bow to the all-powerfulness of God, and the infinity of the Universe and smell the stinking feet of our mortal condition. But instead of crying over that defining reality, Allen teaches us to laugh about it. Laugh is the mourning of truth's death. And no mourning could be more glorious than the joyful ballet between Woody Allen and the white-draped Death with the catchy music of Serge Prokofiev, highlighting with a prodigious harmony the cheerful nature of Death, as the ultimate way to get rid of all the torments inherent to life, now, cynicism has never been so deliriously funny! Woody indeed never rhymed so well with funny, at the pinnacle of his comedic period, after Take the Money and Run or Bananas, before his films would rely essentially on homages, especially to Ingmar Bergman. Woody would never be funnier, which is not saying much because this is one of the funniest films ever. Sergei is naturally comical as a living anachronism with his modern existentialist questions, one century and half before this thinking would be developed by Sartre and Camus, not to mention his trademark black horn-rimmed glassed. The whole film is a delightful experiment on the countless possibilities to make people laugh. Slapstick comedy à la Keaton and Chaplin, wisecracking jokes à la Groucho Marx, naughty and vulgar humor à la Mel Brooks, everything deliciously enrobed with a Comedia Dell' Arte grandeur and decadence. And still with this unique Allenian feel, as he successfully transcends his comical abilities and make you laugh from the most unlikely intelligent stuff, and somewhat, we get the intelligence of his script more efficiently through the medium of humor, the genius of Love and Death is that we may get more from Bergman through THIS film, than the movies it supposedly make laugh of. Think about this  To laugh is proper to man. To make someone laugh is to awake the most humanistic side of his nature. Intelligence is proper to man, too. To laugh is to be intelligent. But nonsense makes laugh, therefore, nonsense inspires intelligence. Nonsense is intelligence when it awakes the most humanistic side of his nature. But to makes laugh, nonsense requires intelligence, intelligence inspires nonsense. Yet intelligence condemns nonsense, and then nonsense condemns nonsense. Defining nonsense is depriving it from its essence, therefore its existence, and what exists through its non existence defies the notion of truth and reason. Nonsense is absurd. But what is absurd is funny. Absurd makes laugh. Absurd is proper to man. Nonsense is proper to man. Quod Erat Demonstrandum.Of course, everything you read doesn't make sense, but it does obey to a certain logic that governs our intelligence, the quest for a meaning. All the purpose of humanity, of the philosophers who passed this world was to find a meaning, to end up with the same conclusion that there's no proper conclusion, no possibility to reason with the human condition without getting confused or mixed up with so many frustrating concerns. If one must accept the existence of God, he should accept whatever God gives him, including the free will that allows him to doubt His existence Knowledge implies doubt, doubt inspires knowledge and vice versa, knowledge constructs intelligence, enough intelligence to get the absurdity of the world. To build knowledge to deconstruct the world. That's the essence of absurdity And Woody Allen raises above the absurdity of our world a masterpiece of pure hilarity, proving that if he's not the Eisenstein (God forbid his glasses were ever broken), he's surely the Einstein of film-making!

Woody indeed never rhymed so well with funny, at the pinnacle of his comedic period, after Take the Money and Run or Bananas, before his films would rely essentially on homages, especially to Ingmar Bergman. Woody would never be funnier, which is not saying much because this is one of the funniest films ever. Sergei is naturally comical as a living anachronism with his modern existentialist questions, one century and half before this thinking would be developed by Sartre and Camus, not to mention his trademark black horn-rimmed glassed. The whole film is a delightful experiment on the countless possibilities to make people laugh. Slapstick comedy à la Keaton and Chaplin, wisecracking jokes à la Groucho Marx, naughty and vulgar humor à la Mel Brooks, everything deliciously enrobed with a Comedia Dell' Arte grandeur and decadence. And still with this unique Allenian feel, as he successfully transcends his comical abilities and make you laugh from the most unlikely intelligent stuff, and somewhat, we get the intelligence of his script more efficiently through the medium of humor, the genius of Love and Death is that we may get more from Bergman through THIS film, than the movies it supposedly make laugh of. Think about this  To laugh is proper to man. To make someone laugh is to awake the most humanistic side of his nature. Intelligence is proper to man, too. To laugh is to be intelligent. But nonsense makes laugh, therefore, nonsense inspires intelligence. Nonsense is intelligence when it awakes the most humanistic side of his nature. But to makes laugh, nonsense requires intelligence, intelligence inspires nonsense. Yet intelligence condemns nonsense, and then nonsense condemns nonsense. Defining nonsense is depriving it from its essence, therefore its existence, and what exists through its non existence defies the notion of truth and reason. Nonsense is absurd. But what is absurd is funny. Absurd makes laugh. Absurd is proper to man. Nonsense is proper to man. Quod Erat Demonstrandum.Of course, everything you read doesn't make sense, but it does obey to a certain logic that governs our intelligence, the quest for a meaning. All the purpose of humanity, of the philosophers who passed this world was to find a meaning, to end up with the same conclusion that there's no proper conclusion, no possibility to reason with the human condition without getting confused or mixed up with so many frustrating concerns. If one must accept the existence of God, he should accept whatever God gives him, including the free will that allows him to doubt His existence Knowledge implies doubt, doubt inspires knowledge and vice versa, knowledge constructs intelligence, enough intelligence to get the absurdity of the world.

Yet, there's something more appealing in Love and Death, a sort of endearing quality in the main character, Sergei Dimitriovitch, brilliantly portrayed by Woody Allen supported by a superb performance from Diane Keaton as the delicious, frivolous and voluptuous Sonja. I never thought Kay Adams could be so damn sex... I mean, funny.Sure, Woody plays the usual neurotic and tormented character but combined with the period setting and the picaresque narrative, it immediately provides a hilarious twist. He's insecure, weak, short, ugly, in a way, he makes us feel superior or luckier, but as the movie progresses, and as we get deeper in his subconscious, we're contaminated by his endless questionings about the meaning of life. Woody Allen's Love and Death takes very seriously the humor it uses to make fun of seriousness, and the inner intelligence of the film relies on the level of absurdity it shamelessly reaches while tackling metaphysical subjects such as love, death, life, sex, and turning them into the most pleonastic derision. Ultimately, Woody Allen's epic period masterpiece resonates as the triumphant intellectual demonstration that life is damn too serious to be taken seriously, life is about living, enjoying, having fun, sex&#x85; Disguised in cowardice and refusal to make war, Sergei's approach is in fact more hedonistic and inspirational in its intelligent demonstration that even for the average schmuck, the greatest things can work out of a misunderstanding!But misunderstanding implies the use of intelligence, and if there's no better comedy than a comedy with a heart, there's no funnier comedy that one with intelligence. And the mightiest power of intelligence relies on its capacity to exceed its idiomatic limits and idiotic means to defy the great law that defines our existence absurdity. Love and Death echoes the philosophical condition of our limited intelligence that can only bow to the all-powerfulness of God, and the infinity of the Universe and smell the stinking feet of our mortal condition. But instead of crying over that defining reality, Allen teaches us to laugh about it. Laugh is the mourning of truth's death.

His movies, all set in the backdrop of Jersey, were each filled with witty dialogue, well-drawn out characters, and humor. 'Chasing Amy,' his 1997 romance movie, perfectly fits the bill as his other top achievements(mainly 'Clerks' and 'Dogma,') while establishing a signature style of it's own.The story follws Holden (Ben Affleck), a comic book artist who writes 'Bluntman and Chronic,' with his longtime friend Banky (Jason Lee.) Holden is introduced to a beautiful woman, Alyssa (a magnificent Joey Lauren Adams) by his very flamboyant friend, Hopper (Dwight Ewell).Holden falls in love with Alyssa in an instant. And everything is looking up when she extends him an invitation to a night club a few days after meeting. Only one problem it's a lesbian club, and Alyssa's fits right in with the crowd.Unlike any other Smith movie, this one poses a very poignant moral conundrum what happens when you fall in love with someone who's attracted to a different sex? The movie constantly questions this, sometimes going a bit overboard. But, for the most part, it's a very balanced argument on the underlying nature of human sexuality preferences and what constitutes as 'love.' But let those deep themes and morale questions scare you off. It's still not a Terrance Malick picture, there's plenty of humor throughout the 1 hour and 51 minute running time. Like many other Smith pictures, the dialogue is VERY raunchy at times. Probably not a good idea to watch this with the parents. Also, the film often mentions back to Smith's previous two efforts (Clerks and Mallrats.) Not saying it's necessary, but in order to complete a viewing experience, prior knowledge of these two will provide additional jokes.I would highly recommend to not only fans who favor Smith's brand of hi-jinks, but too any fan of cinema. I would hesitate to simple label this a 'romantic comedy,' a term that has been soiled in recent years. No, 'Chasing...' is surprisingly more intellgient, emotional, and clever than many, movie other movies in the 'romance' department.

But films like these, free from the ministrations of heartless Hollywood often turn out better than they're bigger budgeted cousins.The Evil Dead has nothing that one could really call a plot. But it works because of what Sam Raimi brings to the film. What it lacks in plotting it makes up for in entertainment. Its not a terribly original film, and Night of the Living Dead was almost certainly an influence on it, but The Evil Dead holds its own as a ferocious, bloodthirsty horror movie.Five teens holed up in a cabin are besieged by spirits from beyond the grave. After reading from a Book of the Dead that was in the cabin, the five of them wind up possessed, one by one becoming demonic zombies. The only one not affected is Ash (Bruce Campbell's feature debut), and as his friends and loved ones turn before his very eyes, it becomes a non-stop fight to survive the night.The Evil Dead is a textbook example of how monolithic budgets are not the beginning and the end of Hollywood cinema. All this film needed was a passionate director, a dedicated cast and a loyal production crew. Add to that plenty of blood, guts and pus galore. From what I've read, The Evil Dead was a difficult shoot on everyone. The hours were long and the weather was terrible, but Sam Raimi roused the crew into shape.Its the sheer confidence he brings that transforms the story. Raimi directs with a fierce energy that enervates the entire movie. The camera seldom stays in one position. It prowls around the cabin, darting into closeup. The restless setups Raimi keeps springing on us make for an intense, almost unbearable experience.Raimi is content to let the camera do much of the work in the first half. Its in the second half that The Evil Dead opens up and takes on the intensity of a nightmare roller-coaster ride. Some of the scares Raimi dreamt up are totally out there. The one memory people take away from the film more than any other, and what had the film classified as a Video Nasty here in the UK, is the scene where Ellen Sandweiss wanders into the woods and is raped by a tree. Its a wrenching, squeamish thing to watch that not even the climax manages to top. Even Raimi regretted putting it in the film.But Raimi doesn't stop there. In the latter half, he goes all out to shock at every opportunity. Considering the film was made on a $350,000 budget, the results are astonishing. The cast vanish into makeup jobs, eerie voices, and blood spurts, spits and showers us in a non-stop orgy of mayhem.The Evil Dead deservedly brought Sam Raimi to attention. But the only member of the cast who went on to any kind of success, and became a mainstay of Sam Raimi's is Bruce Campbell. A childhood friend of his, Campbell mapped out a career as a B-Movie actor. He came to specialise in playing parodies of the lantern-jawed, All-American hero. And later starred in one of this author's favourite TV shows, The Adventures of Brisco County Jr.But here, Campbell is a little flat. Campbell hadn't mastered the ability to remain deadpan in the face of absurdity. He would come to hone that on the Evil Dead sequels, and by the time of Brisco County Jr, he had it down to a fine art. Nevertheless, Campbell was a real trooper. One of the things you can count on when a director is a good friend of the lead actor, is that they inspire them to do things no inflated paycheck could ever do. Campbell went far, above and beyond the call of duty for The Evil Dead. Constant splatterings. Drenched in blood. A merciless work schedule. But it all paid off in the finished product.The one other person on the crew who was propelled to success (arguably more than Raimi) was Joel Coen. Before becoming a directing team with his brother Ethan, and carving out an original, consistently brilliant career, Joel Coen served as editor on The Evil Dead. Although principally a Raimi film, there are times when you can see some of the trademarks of a Coen film. There's none of the idiosyncratic pleasures of Barton Fink and Fargo, but the way the camera observes at a neutral distance the mayhem unfolding before it is classic Coen.Raimi plays The Evil Dead to a shrieking excess and that's really as it should be.

One of the things you can count on when a director is a good friend of the lead actor, is that they inspire them to do things no inflated paycheck could ever do. Campbell went far, above and beyond the call of duty for The Evil Dead. Constant splatterings. Drenched in blood. A merciless work schedule. But it all paid off in the finished product.The one other person on the crew who was propelled to success (arguably more than Raimi) was Joel Coen. Before becoming a directing team with his brother Ethan, and carving out an original, consistently brilliant career, Joel Coen served as editor on The Evil Dead. Although principally a Raimi film, there are times when you can see some of the trademarks of a Coen film. There's none of the idiosyncratic pleasures of Barton Fink and Fargo, but the way the camera observes at a neutral distance the mayhem unfolding before it is classic Coen.Raimi plays The Evil Dead to a shrieking excess and that's really as it should be. The wild overacting from the amateur cast will no doubt provoke fits of the giggles from some and the gore will invoke revulsion from others. But Raimi maintains a perfect lunatic energy that never flags for an instant. The stuff cult classics are made of.

People know it, love it, quote it. But does anyone even remember what this movie is actually about? It's the story of young caddy Danny Noonan, played by Michael O'Keefe, who is trying to finagle his way into a caddy scholarship for college by kissing the proper behinds. But all these years later nobody ever mentions poor O'Keefe or his character when they talk about this movie. Because Rodney Dangerfield stole the show. Or maybe Bill Murray stole the show. And wait, there's Chevy Chase too. Poor O'Keefe never stood a chance. His character may have been at the center of the movie's story but this is not a movie about story. This is a movie about laughs. And with Dangerfield, Murray and Chase involved there are certainly plenty of laughs to go around.So when looking back on this movie you don't focus on the story. You just think of your favorite moments. For many people the majority of those moments seem to revolve around Murray's character of grounds keeper Carl Spackler, a simple man who has total consciousness awaiting him on his deathbed. There's that Dalai Lama bit. There's his wonderful Cinderella story. There's his swimming pool snack. And there's the one scene Murray's Carl shares with Chase's Ty Webb, two comic geniuses in a brilliant back-and-forth. Chase's character is more or less a reserved straight man in the movie though he definitely gets his zingers in too. Not at all reserved is the outrageous Dangerfield who holds nothing back with his blustery, scenery-chewing performance. He'll do or say anything for a laugh. Dangerfield's character of Al Czervik has a lack of tact and good grace which really gets under the skin of Judge Smails, played wonderfully by Ted Knight. The stodgy judge could use a proper nemesis and in the outlandish Al Czervik he more than meets his match. All the good stuff from Murray and Chase and Dangerfield and Knight overshadows O'Keefe. Heck, poor O'Keefe even gets overshadowed by a gopher. The movie may be nominally about young Danny Noonan but it seems that director Harold Ramis knew the big laughs would come from elsewhere and just let the rest of his cast go nuts and do what they do best. And it works terrifically. Yes, some of the jokes and gags fall a little flat. The movie has some fits and starts, doesn't consistently keep up the laughs all the way through. But when it hits it hits big and all in all there are more than enough laughs to cover up a few rough spots. Maybe the movie could have done with just a little bit more attention paid to its actual story. And there are some other characters floating about we might have liked to have spent a little more time with. For instance Cindy Morgan, playing the stunning temptress Lacey Underall, could have been given more to do. In this movie where story is left on the back burner it's really all about everyone in the cast making the most of their respective moments. And everyone does. Even the gopher.

Realize it's been around a long time, but never watched it all the way through. It just seemed hard to get into before, but was in the mood to check it out this time. Like most viewers, I have favorite segments. I agree that it is dated and not in the classic line at all. But in 1952 it was probably a big splash because it was different for the era (maybe even considered a bit racy), and probably compared more favorably with other films of the year.I don't begrudge Gloria Grahame her Oscar for her supporting role. Again, she may have compared more favorably with other supporting actresses that year. But I think she is a skillful actress (did stage work as well), and am glad she received recognition. She has played a range of characters from a gangster moll to that nut-job in Oklahoma. Sometimes actors are awarded for a role that may not be their best, but were passed over the previous year(s) due to a crowded field. That has been said about some lead players with their awards.I liked Dick Powell in this better than anything I have seen of him. It caused me to perk up and watch closely, which I have never done with him before. Maybe it's his character in this, but his portrayal was pleasing to me. He was a strong type, but did seem to be very easily swerved by his wife, but that was the script. And maybe it's not a weakness for a man to give way to his wife to please her. It really didn't seem to weaken him overall. Regardless, his character had a lot of appeal to me.It has been said that this was some of Lana Turner's best work. A line about her character in the film echoes my take on her as an actress in general. It's when Shields (Douglas) comments on her character's poor audition, saying that he wanted her for his lead part anyway because she had star power. He said that as bad as she was in the audition, every eye was on her in her scene. It seems that people become fascinated with some personalities and will flock to see anything with them in it. They just have a draw. Many of these are not really very good performers, even though they are around long enough to pick up some awards. They get lots of chances to hit, being kept at work in film after film because of their box office draw.One reviewer commented that he thought he spotted Kim Novak as the girl provided by the studio as a date for Gaucho (Roland).

I was curious about the Lila actress, the nasty dame who slinked down the stairway, casting the shadow across Georgia's face as she hugged Shields. It was Elaine Stewart &#x96; again, someone attractive who never did much else. And spotting Barbara Billingsley as the wardrobe coordinator was sharp on one reviewer's part. I would have missed her.

When Reservoir Dogs was first released it was met with relatively warm critical reception, however almost 20 years later I am here to tell you whether or not it holds up.For those of you still unaware Reservoir Dogs is a heist movie, but only in premise, in execution however it plays out as a heist gone wrong. We follow a group of robbers each brought together for their specific talents, skills, and most importantly their ability to be trusted. However, it becomes quickly apparent that one amongst them had been miss-judged when they get to the location of the robbery and into the waiting arms of the police. This sends the group scattering in their own directions. This is where the action opens. (I say action because the movie itself opens with a hysterical breakfast conversation regarding Madonna.) After this we see very little of the rest of the heist.From there the film turns into a sort of Clue for adults, as we are slowly introduced to each of the major players of the game. Each of these scenes plays brilliantly, Quentin manages to create within each character a personal motivation and a quiet determined distrust towards every other character. He constantly has the viewer's scrambling towards the discovery of the mole and how each character feels, but he never makes it feel frustrating.This movie more so than any of Tarantino's others plays like a movie made by a writer. There aren't any spectacular sweeping wide shots, or any of the fantastic follow shots he has become so known for. No, this film is a well-planned and plotted sequence of dialog and events staged almost exclusively in an abandoned warehouse. And it is from here that Reservoir Dogs runs into its biggest problems. The film exists in such a singular environment that it seems to drag quicker than other films might. Though the quality of dialog keeps the scenes and movie as a whole from stagnating many viewers will quickly bore of the long scenes of nothing but dialog. Not only that but the characters we are presented with aren't incredibly developed. This is believable enough given that it takes place in a matter of hours, however we never really connect with any of the characters making continual investment in their story rather difficult.These things being said Tarantino's first film still stands as brilliant foreshadowing of the career he would go on to create for himself. The films greatest strengths still lie in the moments it creates, the stuck in the middle with you scene is still one of the most gruesomely original in any film. While some may say that the movie is marred by its simplicity I feel the simplicity was by choice. Everything about this film revels in its simplicity from the names of the characters (simple colors) to the plot itself. Every aspect exudes the outstanding minimalism that can be studied for years to come.While there are places where the film still stumbles, Reservoir Dogs still stands as a fine achievement of film making. Although it drags in places, the dialog and simplicity keep us hanging on long enough to make it to the thrilling conclusion. (The film is a perfectly portioned 99 minutes.) Tarantino's film making prowess proves to us why only he could make something like this work so well. Despite its few flaws Reservoir Dogs stands up twenty years later as a crowning achievement of independent films.

These days in order to get a film made, most filmmakers have this mistaken notion that it has to be all polished and ever-so-perfectly crafted. And if possible, have studio backing and at least one name star. But back in the early 70s, Tobe Hooper and his posse chose to go down to Texas and make an unhinged tale of a very bizarre family. And it's the film that introduced the world to Leatherface. Based loosely on the exploits of Ed Gein, we follow a van full of young people who are traveling down a hot, dusty back road. Unlike a lot of movies since then, the filmmakers wisely decide to reveal little about the characters. Normally, that would make them come across as wooden or paper-thin, but not in this case. The shocking revelation of this film is that the aforementioned crazed family kill travelers and turn them into food, clothing and furniture. Several times in the film, we are shown footage from slaughter houses and slowly it dawns on you that we're viewing the characters the same way the killers do as meat and nothing more. The grisly effects on display aren't nearly as graphic as viewers and critics at the time made it out to be. But what it lacks in full-blown visuals, it heaps on dollops of creepiness and depravity. This film is not for the squeamish in any way. And please don't get me started with the sequels or that god-awful remake. But do make an effort to see this low budget shocker to see what filmmakers could do without the help of studios, stars or even polish.

Then I realized that this movie reminded me of Amelie. Sure enough, it is the same director although this was made about a decade earlier. Amelie is one of my favorite movies; not just for the story but also for the unique imagery. This movie shares that unique visual style but in a more grotesque fashion. Faces are shown in closeup that border on nightmarish. Colors and atmosphere meld to form a bleak, murky, misty and dreary filmscape. It is at once charming and horrifying. One of my favorite scenes is when Louison (Dominique Pinon) is blowing bubbles in the hallway. The two mischievous boys (or young rascals played by Boban Janevski and Mikael Todde) are immediately entranced and Louison is spared from any future harassment from them. Indeed, at one point they save his life with their mischief on others. Another of my favorite scenes is when Louison and Juliet (Marie-Loure Dougnat) are playing a duet, she on the cello, he on the saw(?!). Together with the music it was a magic moment. In fact, whenever Louison is shown clowning around, the music is soft and whimsical. Another wonderful moment is when Louison and the Butcher's lover (Karin Viard) are unintentionally playing a song from squeaky mattress springs. In another scene, she and Louison are dancing in his apartment. It looks well enough until you notice that Louison has 3 legs giving new meaning to having 2 left feet. These delightful moments are a stark contrast to the rest of the film. I guess I should expound on what the movie is about. Louison is an out of work clown whose partner has been eaten. He tries to get a job as a handyman for a butcher (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) who is also a tenement owner. The butcher sizes him up and is not sure he will do. He thinks Louison is a bit too scrawny. However, Louison's luggage is all over the street so he gets the job just to clear the way. It would have been better had he not because in an earlier scene, you see someone hiding in a trash can and then getting butchered as the screen goes black. That someone was the last handyman. This movie is set in a post apocalyptic future where food is scarce and indeed, grain has become currency. The world has become divided between those that live underground and still use grain as food instead of currency and those that hoard grain and eat... well, anything else they can get their hands on except grain. I don't think I've ever seen a blacker comedy than this but if you enjoyed Amelie, I think you will also like this movie.

Basically hot shot Hollywood studio executive Griffin Mill (Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Tim Robbins) is in charge of hearing a movie pitch (sometimes he asks for twenty five words or less) from a scriptwriter and decides whether their idea has the potential to be made, be successful and make money, but he rejects thousands. Lately his job is danger of being taken over by new arrival story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher), and he has recently been receiving threatening blood letter postcards from supposedly a rejected scriptwriter. With the anonymous writer giving a date to when he was rejected Mill back tracks through past rejected scripts to the exact date, and he finds an address which he decides to visit in person and call the telephone number also, to see for himself who picks up, and it appears to be June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi). It is after this however that he finds and concludes that it is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio) stalking him, when he tracks him down watching his favourite film, The Bicycle Thief, and they go for a drink together where he pretends like he recognises him from their previous encounter. Eventually their discussion outside in the bar parking lot turns into an argument and aggressive fight, but Mill manages to drown Kahane in a slope puddle, and to cover his tracks he makes it look like a robbery gone wrong. The threatening postcards do not seem to be over however when he receives another new one, and he attends the funeral of Kahane where he meets June in person, and studio chief of security Walter Stuckel (Fred Ward) warns him that in the murder he is known to be the last person to see him alive. Soon enough police Detective Avery (Whoopi Goldberg) and partner Detective DeLongpre (Lyle Lovett) show up to question him as they think he is guilty of the murder, and after this he gets a postcard suggesting he and the writer meet. While waiting for the mystery writer he is cornered by two screenwriters, one being Tom Oakley (Richard E. Grant), pitching their movie Habeas Corpus, a film with no big stars and a depressing rather than happy ending, and then leaving he gets a fax from the anonymous person saying to lift his coat up, and he just survives a near attack from a rattlesnake. He finds his feelings for June, and after persuades his already girlfriend Bonnie Sherow (Cynthia Stevenson) to go away they go to an awards ceremony together, and after those two writers who pitched Habeas Corpus are invited back. Mill convinces Levy it is a good idea and a worthy Oscar contender, of course he actually wants the film to be made and flop, and when it starts going downhill he will jump in and make big changes to make a difference to box office and reclaim his place in the studio. After an encounter with Bonnie at the airport with June he also manages to avoid DeLongpre by pretending to have left his passport behind, so they change their plans and go to an isolated desert spa and build their relationship more. Then Mill gets a call from his attorney that studio head Joel Levison (Brion James) has been fired, and the police require him for a lineup as there was an eyewitness at the murder who can identify the man that did it. A year after the female witness chose DeLongpre in the lineup the film Habeas Corpus has been made with big stars and a slightly more upbeat ending, the writers don't fully approve, Mill has become the new studio head and plans to save the film, June is now pregnant and his wife, Bonnie is ignored and fired, and he finally gets a call from the postcard writer himself who pitches a film, about a studio executive who kills a writer and gets away with it, but he realises this is blackmail, and Mill makes a deal to make this film, The Player.

This film alone is the reason why animation is so strong and how Walt Disney became a king in the full-length animation industry. Certainly a lot better than the CG biz that we're seeing today.

Sounds silly? It may, considering it is an animated film which a majority of people don't take seriously when in the subject of the greatest movies anyone has ever seen. I personally love animated anything, whether it be cartoons, movies, shorts, etc. The Lion King *IS* the king of all Disney films. We all know the tragic tale of the death of Simba's father, even if we had not seen the movie, thus recognition and praise this movie receives absolutely deserves it no less. This is my favourite movie. The art is simply fantastic. The animation is just breathtaking. The story -- though based off of 'Hamlet' -- is beautiful and will leave you in tears. The voice actors and actresses did an impeccable job for each of the characters' personalities. I especially adore the music. The Lion King had introduced me to African music and I have loved it ever since. The songs in the movie such as Can You Feel The Love Tonight (one sung by Elton John, and one sung by Kristle Edwards along with the voices of adult Simba and Nala, both pieces of which I love and listen to everyday) and Hakuna Matata are divine and catchy, not to mention adorable. I cannot say how much I love this film. I'm in love with it. The producers and directors and every person who had contributed to the making of it did a marvelous job. Overall, this movie is PERFECT. I've watched it a hundred times already and I'll watch it a hundred more without feeling the slightest bit sick of it.

All I can say is after watching this movie countless of times as a kid it still holds up today.The story is about a young lion cub named Simba who is next in line to be the king of the jungle. Simba is rather mischievous and gets into trouble a lot with his friend Nala. His uncle Scar is jealous of Simba because he gets to be the king, so he hatches a plan with his Hyena goons to kill Simba and King Mufasa. They succeed in killing Mufasa but Simba escapes and blames himself for Mufasa's death. He goes into exile and meets two jungle bums Timon and Pumbaa. They teach him the Hakuna Matata(no worries) life style and Simba grows up without a care in the world. But the lions in Pride Rock don't have it so good. Scar has let everything go to ruin and is too stubborn to leave to go look for food and water. Nala leaves to find help and finds Simba. She tries to convince him to come home but he still blames himself for Mufasa's death(not knowing it was Scar who killed him to begin with). Simba must now make a decision to either run from his past or challenge Scar to become the next king.I haven't really done the plot justice by paraphrasing it but I'm sure a good many people are already quite familiar with this movie. Everything in it is top notch. The animation, the all-star cast of characters, the epic score by Hans Zimmer and the catchy tunes from Elton John and Tim Rice. Much like the old Disney movies this movie isn't afraid to get dark. There's numerous assassination attempts(one that succeeds), dark themes you wouldn't find in most kid's films nowadays, and a few jokes aimed towards the older audience. What is not to love about this movie? The only bad thing I can think about this film doesn't come from the original edit. It's the song Morning Report that comes from the special edition released a few years back. The song worked well for the Broadway show but in the movie it just slows things down and seems unnecessary next to the other songs. But still it doesn't change my opinion of the actual movie. I am going to see it in 3D? Probably. But even if the 3D turns out bad it'll be nice to see what it might have been like to watch it on the big screen.

Basically, set in World War II, we look at the occupants of a Polish theatre company while the country is invaded by the Nazi Germans, and particularly the antics of great great actor Joseph Tura (Jack Benny) and his actress wife Maria Tura (Carole Lombard, in her last film). The film has an odd opening with Adolf Hitler in the middle of Warsaw, but it is actually actor Bronski (Tom Dugan) proving his fellow actors that his resemblance to the real Hitler is uncanny, but a little girl recognises him and asks for his autograph. Then we see the production company putting on Shakespeare's Hamlet, with Bronski saying with his friend and colleague Greenberg (Felix Bressart) that he wants a starring role, i.e. carry the spear, and Greenberg says he'd love to play Shylock. Then we see Maria getting a bouquet of flowers from young pilot Lieut. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack), and the arrange to meet when her husband Joseph is one stage as Hamlet playing the famous to be or not to be speech, and someone blatantly walking out, Maria and Sobinski begin an affair before he has to leave to join the war fight. When Sobinski gets to his Polish division for the British Royal Air Force he meets resistance leader Professor Siletsky (Stanley Ridges), but he gets suspicions when he asks the Professor to pass a message to Maria, but he has never heard of the famous actress, even living in Poland for ages. Back in Warsaw Maria herself is taken by two Nazi soldiers to Siletsky who does pass on the message, but then he wants to recruit her as a spy for the Nazis, she pretends to be interested and leaves with an excuse. Telling about what happened she gets her husband Joseph keen to do what needs to be done, killing the Professor, so when Maria returns to him she pretends to find him attractive, and members of the production company pretend to take him to Gestapo. But in fact he is taken to the theatre disguised with props and Joseph disguised as Col. Ehrhardt, hoping to get valuable Nazi information, and with his nerves he cannot help repeating the words so they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt?, and the Professor realises he's been duped, but being chased he is shot himself. Now Joseph disguises himself as Siletsky with a fake beard and glasses to destroy information that must not be found, but he is unintentionally taken to the real Col. Ehrhardt (Sig Ruman) to give a report, and he smooths his way through the meeting, and manages to find out Hitler will be visiting Poland. The next day the real Siletsky's body is discovered, but Joseph does not find out before he goes for another meeting with Ehrhardt, so he placed in a room with the body, and he tries to dupe his way in making it look like the body is the one in disguise, quickly shaving his beard and putting on his spare fake one, and when he is about to escape the actors turn up to take off the other fake beard and pretend to take him to prison. Then the biggest event the actors have faced comes along, Hitler and many others are attending a play in the country, and Bronski dons his convincing Hitler moustache again and get in unnoticed, and Joseph is disguised as the head of the Führer's men. After whatever happens there Maria is ready to leave with the other actors, but Ehrhardt suddenly shows up trying to seduce her, and she is saved by his shock of seeing Bronski in his Hitler disguise, allowing her to walk out. All the actors are on Hitler's plane and easily dispose of the Nazis on board as they mindlessly obey orders from disguised Bronski to simply jump out without parachutes, they land and after the little surprise at the disguised actor they are praised as heroes, and asked what reward they want Joseph is interrupted by Maria saying he wants to play Hamlet. The end of the film sees Joseph indeed playing Hamlet on stage and eyeballing Sobinski in the audience as he says the words to be or not to be, as it triggered the hypnotised walk out reaction, but he instead has a new young man walk out. Also starring Lionel Atwill as Rawitch, Charles Halton as Producer Dobosh and Maude Eburne as Anna. Obviously World War II was actually going on at the time, so that is the only way they could get away with the bad taste jokes that are impossible to remake and recreate in modern time (even though a remake was tried with Mel Brooks in 1983), but it is not just the comedy that is great, the cast led by Benny and Lombard are terrific, and there is some poignancy to what is going on, a most watchable Second World War satire.
