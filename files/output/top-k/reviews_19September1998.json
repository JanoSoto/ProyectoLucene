If you, the viewer, are not familiar with Mystery Science Theater 3000, better known as MST3K, I recommend that you rent\/buy\/borrow, beg, or steal tapes to become a tad familiar with the concept.The concept is  riffing a B-or-worse-scifi-movie; the victim, er-- subject, in this case, is This Island Earth, a classic from the 50's.  There's this guy (Mike) who's been shot up to an orbiting space station (the Satellite of Love, or SOL) by a Mad Scientist (Dr. Clayton Forrester).  Mike is a replacement test subject (Joel, who made the robots for companionship, escaped), and he and Joel's 'bots (short for ro-bots) ease the stress of being test subjects by making wise@$$ remarks while the movie is running. Then there are little interval segments that attempt to tell a coherent narrative.The catch is that the bots are actually only puppets made from a gumball machine head, salad bowl, Tupperware interlocking set of flower vases, and armatures from folding adjustable desk lamps.  The original actor who voices Crow T. Robot is Trace Beaulieu, who also plays Dr. Forrester (ah, the magic of motion pictures!).  The guy who voices Tom Servo is Kevin Murphy-- well, if you really want to see him, you'll have to find the episodes on tape and go looking for his appearances as other characters.This movie is much better than the episodes that have appeared either on Comedy Central or the Sci-Fi Channel, primarily because Best Brains, the production company, had more money to make better sets, props, and better staging of gags.  The Hubble was great, as was the amusing and embarrassing segment where Dr. Forrester ends up in the Metalunan guy's shower. aaagghhh!!!The only two things I miss are Joel Hodgson, who was the original host, and Frank Conniff, who played Dr. Forrester's assistant, TV's Frank.  Joel was a much different test subject than Mike-- Joel was more introspective, did many more musical bits on the show, was more creative Invention Exchange was Joel's idea; as a comic\/magician, he made most of the bizarre and funny inventions on the show.  I feel that Joel's presence, as writer and actor, would have given a tighter, more coherent slant to the experiment (but then, again, I could be biased!).Frank Conniff, as TV's Frank, was the best inept sidekick an inept Mad Scientist could have, and Frank was the perfect foil for Forrester.

However, I'm a big fan of action\/thriller movies, and the second half of Titanic could have been much better. For one, there were too many scenes of unimportant people falling this way and that and dying. If they focused more on the main characters, that would cut off some extra running time. Also, I'm not too sure that a disaster thriller and a romance story can mix into an overall product. You know the boat is gonna sink, so why throw in a whole different second storyline?

It has a tongue-in-cheek humour rarely seen in mainstream films and despite being a comedy does at least examine the serious issue of American perceptions in foreign countries. Stillman presents all side of the issue fairly and although, heavily fictionalised, the audience is still left to decide for themselves about the perceived American arrogance in Spain. I recognise that Stillman often comes across as being too-clever, and this alienates some viewers but their is a definite mind-set there and one well worth getting into. Stillman seems to use a complex system of irony  and self-reflexive humour to get his point across and I personally would consider him to be amongst the greatest of cinema auteurs.

The scenario has twists and turns, basically it is not boring for me because the details of secrets are not revealed in a direct way. The first three main characters are all great. This is probably the best movie I've seen about Wesley Snipes. Irene Jocob is quite a cameo in this movie. All in all, it is quite entertaining and worth recommending for action movie lovers.

I think the most interesting scenes are those where there is no dialogue but the camera follows the characters as they inwardly contemplate what this all means (Bill Pullman, Andie McDowell). Unfortunately, we as the viewers are also given (too much) time to contemplate what it means. Everything is WAY too understated. The movie slows to a stop in many places. You start to like it (the romance with Kat and the investigator, the interaction of Bill Pullman's character and the Mexican-American people) and then it doesn't follow through. The dialogue at the film school, in which the characters give a monologue for a class is probably the most interesting dialogue. Some rap, some tell a story, some recite their own poetry. That was the most moving part of the movie. While Wenders has a important point to make, it doesn't come through clearly and the viewer is left uncaring, uninterested. Maybe the only thing that could have helped the End of Violence is more good ole fashioned...violence <g>.
