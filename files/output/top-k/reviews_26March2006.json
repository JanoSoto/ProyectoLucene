I considerably enjoyed it. Travolta and Cage are two of the more charismatic actors out there, and having them play off each other in this fashion makes for a darn good movie. The opportunity for the actors to play both personalities helps you really get into each character's life and discover what drives him and where his flaws lie. As far as the cinematography is concerned, I felt it was up-to-par, nothing spectacular, but certainly not a below-average effort for the kind of films John Woo has given us in the past. This is also the kind of movie where you have all these other great supporting actors. At the time, they weren't A-List celebs, but now that you've seen them in other projects (Thomas Jane, Dominique Swain, Colm Feore) you suddenly have that moment of recognition - Hey, its that guy, from that other movie! I totally forgot he was in this! As for Nic Cage, it was totally his movie. Travolta is cool, no doubt, but this was way more a Nic Cage movie. I don't know what it is, but I can honestly say I've liked every one of his movies I've seen. Overall, I'd say great movie, excellent acting, and awesome action.

This is the movie that Crash wanted to be; it could not have missed the mark more completely. On every level--visual aesthetic, acting, direction, pacing, etc.--this film succeeds. That it's also an immensely intelligent dissection of race in America (not just simply race in Bed-Stuy) elevates it above other well-made pictures about ethnic strife (I'm looking at you Grand Canyon). Why is this movie more intelligent than Crash? I would argue that, because it works on a smaller scale, it allows the characters to grow and seem more organic. Mookie, Radio Raheem, Buggin' Out, Da Mayor, and Mother Sister, among others, all seem like real, viable characters. We spend enough time with them over the course of the film's two hours to understand them and their motivations. When Ryan Phillippe shoots Larenz Tate at the end of Crash, it feels remarkably like a plot machination put there to make a point rather than a direction that the film should logically make. However, Mookie's choice to throw a garbage can through the window of Sal's restaurant makes complete and total sense given the events that have been occurring that day. It's an event caused by exhaustion and frustration; we understand why Mookie would do it even if we don't agree with him. We might understand Phillippe's actions in Crash (he thought Tate had a gun), but they seem a bit more unrealistic. That's the other wonderful thing about Do the Right Thing--its balancing of realistic characters with a color saturated and unreal Brooklyn neighborhood. Lee's direction and Ernest Dickerson's magnificent cinematography remind me for no tangible reason of Marvel Comics from the 1960s and 1970s. The world in which these characters operates seems a little unreal and that only heightens their naturalism. It's an amazing touch and one of which I am in awe. Then there's the acting. I cannot think of a single weak performance in this film; it's a wonderful ensemble. I've always been a particular fan of Danny Aiello's and Spike's performances and that makes sense--they carry the film. The supporting roles are filled with the likes of John Turturro and Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee and Richard Edson. It's also got a nice turn from Samuel L. Jackson as the Greek chorus\/DJ. Do the Right Thing, though, would fail in spite of its realistic characters, performances, cinematography, and direction if it were not for a thematically ambiguous story. What is the right thing referred to in the title? To me the answer has always been no thing. Nobody in the film, really, does the right thing except, maybe Vito, Mother Sister, or Da Mayor, but that's questionable, as those characters don't actually do anything. Their inaction is just as much an indictment of their character as Mookie's throwing the garbage can, Buggin' Out's silly campaign, Radio Raheem's anger, the policeman's murdering Raheem, Sal's latent (and Vito's obvious) racism, etc. Or maybe those actions are the right thing? I don't think so, but I'm sure someone could make a convincing argument in support of Buggin' Out's boycott or Mookie's can-throwing. That's why this movie works---it's complicated and muddy. It's morally relativistic just like the world. Spike Lee has been often labeled as polemical, but he's anything but in this film. It's a film that's angry about the state of race in America but that's nevertheless willing to point the finger in all directions at once. That's a rare thing to see in cinema, and it's the rare thing Crash aspired to achieve only to fail.

However, this leads to a dramatic confrontation with Kirk's old nemesis, Khan, who has been exiled for many years on the barren planet Alpha Ceti V. Khan is bent upon revenge and also getting his hands on the Genesis device, a potentially dangerous weapon. This poses a threat to scientists working on this Genesis project, including Kirk's long lost love, Dr. Carol Marcus. (This is all Star Trek, by the way. Don't get your theology from it. In fact, it teaches a lesson about the dangers of trying to fool around with creation!) Ricaro Montalban makes Khan a formidable, vengeful, and memorable villain. Kristie Alley portrays quite convincingly a new Trek character, a Vulcan commander called Lieutenant Saavik. Wonderful acting and interactions as usual for Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, and all the other now aging Enterprise crew members (Scotty, Chekov, Sulu, and Uhura) have much their typically great characters.The whole concept of having Khan resurface is clever, although his TOS episode Space Seed wasn't particularly one of my favorites. Of course there are the typical engrossing space battles as well as great special effects, which is practically all the first Star Trek movie, The Motion Picture had going for it.

In fact, it teaches a lesson about the dangers of trying to fool around with creation!) Ricaro Montalban makes Khan a formidable, vengeful, and memorable villain. Kristie Alley portrays quite convincingly a new Trek character, a Vulcan commander called Lieutenant Saavik. Wonderful acting and interactions as usual for Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, and all the other now aging Enterprise crew members (Scotty, Chekov, Sulu, and Uhura) have much their typically great characters.The whole concept of having Khan resurface is clever, although his TOS episode Space Seed wasn't particularly one of my favorites. Of course there are the typical engrossing space battles as well as great special effects, which is practically all the first Star Trek movie, The Motion Picture had going for it. Unfortunately, no interesting aliens here, only the villainous Khan. However, the portrayal of Kirk's somewhat disillusioned aging process is well captured. Also, needless to say, the entire plot line regarding his old love and his discovery that he has a grown son, David, certainly make for a dramatic tale.Of course the ending is a legend in Trek circles. Spock's tremendous sacrifice to save the Enterprise and her crew from certain disaster must be one of the most immortal death scenes in all cinema...his unforgettable speech about the needs of the many outweighing that of the one, and Kirk's grief at losing his longtime friend. My tears were falling long before Spock's torpedo casket was fired off into space!It's a Star Trek masterpiece, and a highly entertaining, gripping, and dramatic work of science fiction in general that can be enjoyed even by those who are not normally Trek fans.

Before seeing this movie a couple of years ago, I wasn't aware that there were skinheads in modern day. Even though the movie is quite controversial, it brings out a moral which everyone should respect. I love how the movie defined society and the influence of a person's environment, family, and upbringing. American History X was an excellent movie and it is also a great movie to tell others about. There are plenty of uneducated people out there that need to understand how their actions may be wrong. I think that this movie should be taught in school, or at least segments of it. It is a great movie and it will definitely pertain to modern society in 5, 10, 20 years because these issues still haven't stopped.

The film moves inexorably to its tragic and triumphant end--forcing the viewer to examine the way he lives his own life and what he would be willing to do for truth and justice in the most difficult of situations.

This film is a wonderful achievement and much more mature and sure-handed than a lot of the films Spike has made since. It's not quite Do the Right Thing (but that film feels, quite simply, like a blessed and untouchable project), but it holds up better than Malcolm X or Jungle Fever or Clockers or He Got Game--all very good films as well.Why do I like this film so much? It's sweet-natured. In many ways, it reminds me of a film like Millions, which I also adored. There are too many nasty movies (don't get me wrong, I enjoy nastiness from time to time) and too few nice ones. Or rather too few nice ones that don't drop into cliché and cloying sappiness. Delroy Lindo and Alfre Woodard are excellent as always, but the kids here really steal the show (the same was true of Millions--maybe I just like movies with realistic, precocious kids). The film has a bright palette similar to Do the Right Thing and the early scenes in Malcolm X that works perfectly. The story too is something to behold. It doesn't follow a typical path and, as a result, feels more like the realistic life and times of a black family in New York in the 1970s. The film is really touching and, perhaps, that's because Crooklyn feels more personal than many other Spike Lee films. All in all, this is a great and underrated film.

The actors do a superb job and no detail was spared in the sets and costumes. The story is simple enough but is acted very well. The only drawback I see with the film is that some of the dialogue seems too contemporary to have been spoken in 18th century France.

It's a very deep, depressing ,totally absorbing film. It's hard to get it all in one viewing , but it really sucks you in. I suppose people either love it or hate it , or just don't get it. Anyway I've been listening to the CD Celebrities at their Worst , and there's a cut in which Ernie Anderson , father of the films director ,PT Anderson, is swearing a blue streak. The Jason Robards character is probably based on Ernie Anderson , because if you heard the Ernie Anderson CD , you would swear you were watching a scene from Magnolia. In fact , Ernie Anderson should have had a writing credit, because Jason Riobard's dialog is lifted from that Ernie Anderson cut . It's very interesting.

Scarface is a film that has the power to make Al Pacino the best actor ever. The accent, music, message are clear and given in an effective way. I can not understand those critics who found Al Pacino's acting in Scarface bad. The posters of the movie are still on the walls. The quotes saying make the way for the bad guy or say hello to my little friend are all classic. The relationship between Tony and his sister is depicted in a very sensible way. This is one of my all time favorites. American dream could not be depicted better. The rise and fall of Tony Montana is a lesson.
