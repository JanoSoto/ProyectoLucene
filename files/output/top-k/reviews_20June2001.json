Atlantis has been a mystery to man for centuries, even Plato is quoted about the disappearance of Atlantis.  Now Disney studios have made it's most lavish and expensive non-computer generated animated film to date, ATLANTIS THE LOST EMPIRE. ATLANTIS, begins with the sinking of Atlantis, as young Princess Kida witnesses her mother being taken by the blue crystal that is the lifeforce of Atlantis, the city is covered by a shield as the ocean covers it.  Now it's the early 20th century, museum boiler tech Milo Thatch (voiced by Michael J. Fox) has done years of research to prove that Atlantis does exist.  He is laughed and ignored by the museum board of directors, but when Milo returns home he meets the very sexy and mysterous Helga Sinclair (Claudia Christian).  Helga takes Milo to meet billionaire Preston B. Whitmore (John Mahoney), who has funded a expedition team to look for Atlantis.  The team includes a very big yet friendly Doctor Sweet (Phil Morris), demolitionist Vinny Santorini (Don Father Gudio Sarducchi Novello), dirt expert Mole (Corey Burton), mechanist Audrey Ramirez (Jacqueline Obradors), radio operator Florance Stanley (Wilhelmina Packard), chief Cookie Farnsworth (the late Jim Varney), and Commander Lyle Rourke (James Garner).  Milo is invited because of his knowledge and reading of the Atlantian language. Milo explains that Atlantis was centuries before anyone else's time, they even had aeroplanes and electricity before it disappeared.  So the team travel in a submarine to look for the lost city.  Once it is found Milo befriends and falls in love with an older Princess Kida (Cree Summer) who protects her ailing father King Nedakh (Leonard Nimoy). While Milo learns of the way the Atlantians manage to live for centuries, Commander Rourke and the crew find a way to turn in a discovery trip into a treasure hunt, which could endanger the lives of the citizens of Atlantis. ATLANTIS is Disney's most ambitious animated feature in years, it's directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise (the two men who made the best recent Disney animated film BEAUTY & THE BEAST).  And now they have made a film that is on the same level of greatness and classic status.  I highly loved ATLANTIS, it's the kind of film that brought out the kid in me, when I loved to watch a good adventure.  It is indeed pretty violent (there are quite a few deaths shown) but it is intelligent, fun, and most of all exciting. What I found enjoyable about ATLANTIS is 1.) there are no cute fuzzy animals (i.e. THE LION KING)  2.) there are no scenes where a character can't express how they feel, so they are going to sing it to us (i.e. ALADDIN, LION KING, LITTLE MERMAID, POCHANTAS, etc.)  3.) there are not one, not two, but three sexy female characters that are on the same level as Jessica Rabbit (Princess Kida, Helga Sinclair, and Audrey Ramirez)  4.) No cute animal or sidekick to steal every scene (Mushu in MULAN) 5.) It's strong support of supporting characters who are all different and intresting 6.) it's not like any other Disney animated film that I have seen. Sadly, the highly overrated Dreamworks SHREK is ruining the Disney films.  SHREK is the film for people who enjoy potty humor (oh gee Shrek broke wind in the pond and killed the fish, Ho! Ho! It is to laugh).  While ATLANTIS continues the Disney tradition with it's imagination and visuals as well as funnier humor. People are flocking to see SHREK when they are missing the much more enjoyable ATLANTIS.  A child who watches SHREK will more than likely have their mouth washed out with soap.  While ATLANTIS brings out the imagination in all of us. Unlike last summers TITAN A.E. ATLANTIS isn't just aimed for boys, and it's not as gruesome as TITAN.  It's along the lines of a Indiana Jones film, with mystery, romance, and excitement.

I was eight years old, and was with my mother. I kept falling asleep, and waking up with my eyes watery from all the smoke. I only mention this because this was the first time I saw Kim Novak in a movie, and immediately fell in love with her, thinking her the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. Now all these many years later, and after seeing Picnic several times, the last being a few months ago on the newly restored letterboxed dvd, I can happily state that the Picnic is still fine and tasty after all these years. And although no longer in love with Ms. Novak, I still think she was one of the best looking female movie stars of the late 1950's, and also very underrated as an actress. The movie was based on the well received play by the tragic William Inge, who killed himself in the early 70's, and covers a short span of time in the lives of a family living in a small town in Kansas. Theres the single mom Flo Owens played by the fine Betty Field, and her two daughters, beautiful Madge played by Novak and younger tomboy Millie (a standin perhaps for a young Inge) played by Susan Stasberg. Into their dreary lives comes William Holden, a drifter with a past and a real nice smooth chest. He soon turns things upside down & inside out and although its been pointed out many times that Holden was too old for the role, I don't agree. Watching him sway swagger and move you can understand why Novak and most of the other women in the film would be taken in by him, you can feel the sexual tension cracking & sizzling like a summer lighting storm. Novak is engaged to the town rich kid, played by Cliff Robertson also young and handsome, but as soon as la Novak catches sight of Holden with his shirt off, its bye bye Cliff and hello Bill. Moma Betty is aghast at the thought of her queen of the picnic taking up with a no good bum like Holden and giving up her chance for the good life. Holden who just so happens to have gone to college with Robertson, is in town to look him up and hit him for a job at his old man's plant. Also hanging around is Rosalind Russell who is a spinster school teacher boarding with the Owens, and her timid boyfriend Howard played by Arthur O' Connell. Both are fine, and Russell especially has some great moments especially her drunken scene at the picnic, and her begging Howard to marry her. Silly Roz gave up her sure shot of winning a supporting Oscar for this film, because she refused to be considered as a supporting player. Too bad, because she is wonderful. Of course one cannot fail to mention the sexy erotic dance at the picnic between Novak and Holden, which is still one of the great sex scenes ever filmed. Directed by Joshua Logan who filmed on location and used many of the town folks as extras, the film has a nice feel to it. The lengthy actual picnic of the title is especially fine.  Also of note is James Wong Howe's beautiful soft pastel color cinematography, George Dunings score, Jo Mielziner's production design and the great aeriel shot at the end of the film.

A fine suspense story is combined with romantic tension in the main plot, and there are numerous sub-plots, some humorous and some moving, all with many psychological overtones.  The main characters are wonderfully portrayed and full of life.  The apparently simple setting in an apartment complex is developed into a world filled with intriguing and sometimes unsettling possibilities, and this apparently average neighborhood comes to life with a wealth of lavish visual detail and interesting minor characters.  It is the kind of film-making that (like many of Hitchcock's greatest movies) is very flattering to the viewer.  The director assumes that his audience will pay close enough attention to appreciate the many subtleties with which he has filled the movie.  It rewards both careful attention and repeated viewings, since there is much more here than merely a suspense plot, as good as that story is in itself.For the first 30 minutes or so, we simply get to know the characters.  Jimmy Stewart gives one of his best performances as a photographer recuperating from an injury, forced to spend several weeks staring out his apartment window at the minor dramas in the lives of his neighbors.  Grace Kelly is ideal in the role of his perfect girlfriend, who can never find a way to break down Stewart's reserve.  The study of their relationship would have made a good movie by itself.  Almost every action and every word between them is filled with meaning, and what they see in the lives of others is an interesting reflection of the tensions and possibilities in their own present and future.  Thelma Ritter is wonderful as a colorful, no-nonsense nurse who constantly sheds some light - sometimes unwanted - on what is happening between them.

First the cast is not brilliant it's made great by the cinematography, the editing and mainly the directing, which has become something of a trademark of Cameron.  Secondly, some key elements of the first film are copied (except the intellect), e.g. the entrepreneurial dilemma.  That does not mean that the rest of the plot isn't fantastic the story builds up gradually and explodes even further than Alien (including plot-twists).  Third, the aesthetics are gone.  All the subtle details from Alien are replaced by funky eye-catchers.  But then again that doesn't diminish the reality of what's going on.  It does explain why Aliens has more votes than Alien though.  Finally, Aliens keeps up with the times and is definitely one of the 10 best SF-movies ever made.  As far as I'm concerned this still surpasses every Star Wars episode there is this is not just greasy kid-stuff!  Did you know that the aliens are actually crossbreedings of the Terminator and E.T., as is Johnny Five (Short Circuit, 1986) ?

Disney has a notoriety for creating such worlds, and with the exception of their last couple years' work, they have always been some of the most apt at the trade.Unfortunately, Disney also has a notoriety for blatantly plagiarizing from eastern works, and Atlantis is no exception.  It's easy enough finding comparisons out there without the aid of a well-learned fan, so it should suffice to say that the creators of this movie probably spent a couple weeks watching anime and playing RPGs, and then took all the ideas they must have thought looked cool and applied them to this movie without understanding the principles that made them work in the first place.The primary story is simple enough  Milo Thatch, a bookworm who aspires to discover the city of Atlantis, heads out on his search after being handed a journal with vital clues in regards to the lost city's whereabouts.  Along the way he befriends any crew member he can find who is not an Anglo-Saxon American, and falls madly in love with the Atlantean princess once he reaches the city.  After a day's stay, the crew commander, along with his storm troopers (all as non-descript as the 30-some-odd white crew members whom Milo never befriended), busts out some heavy-fire artillery and proceeds to steal the Atlanteans' primary life-source, his sole purpose being a meager profit and a place in the history books.The political undertones of Atlantis remind me of a Japanese RPG by the name of Xenogears.  Just as from the work that inspired it, it featured innumerable religious references that were so preposterously out of place that you couldn't help but laugh whenever the narrative made a religious comment, for it seemed as though the writer had simply opened up to a random page of the Bible for inspiration whenever he was stuck.  Though Atlantis contains very few religious references, the political ones appear to fit this vein;  you'd be hard-pressed to find a more inappropriate format for a writer to express his other-worldly understanding of the problems that plague society.If this were the only problem with Atlantis, it'd be a forgivable trait that probably wouldn't hinder the overall presentation.  But since Disney decided to take a more adventurous approach that includes more action than comedy, the movie also fails in a narrative sense.  Everything, from Milo's inspiration, to the journey to Atlantis, to the discovery of its culture, is handled with such breakneck speed that it's impossible to associate with either the characters or the situations.Obviously, you're going to have to retain a young child's interest when it comes to this type of movie, so a quick narrative is an almost unavoidable device.  But it's not acceptable to include every social stereotype that a child has grown up with in this country as a substitute for characterization.  Ignoring the fact that it's historically inaccurate considering the time period that the story transpires in to begin with, the stereotypes that are presented are a bad enough influence to be considered politically incorrect.The paradoxical, or even hypocritical nature of this movie will no doubt sail over the target audience's head.  So I'm certainly going to sleep soundly knowing that the leading child's entertainment company is continuing the American government's plot to brainwash its populace into becoming blubbering idiots.  If you like to live in a bucket, it's perfectly fine by me.The only thing bothering me is this what the hell is Mole?

The excitement for me was suddenly all over in the elevator scene at the end which is truly too much.Not really a recommendation unless you are easily convinced. The errors and predictable plot just get in the way and the film remains simply a projection onto a screen.

Now, I'm not saying it is 100% accurate, but it has the right idea. I'm 15 and I do what all of these kids in the film do, maybe not to that extent, but I have expierienced the things in this film. I'm not going to lie. I, once agian, only 15, have done a lot of varieties of drugs, I've stolen many times from stores, I have had sex, I've gotten in fights at the park over stupid things with strangers, I've broken in to places, and I have been to many heavy parties.       But the reason I'm saying the film isn't totally accurate is because it makes us seem like bad people because we do it. I am a good student at school, I have wonderfully nice friends, and I will hopefully one day become a film maker. But I still do all of these things. In the film we are potrayed like senseless bullies who have no hearts. We do.      I have also done a review on Gummo, another film from Harmony Korine. The funny thing about that film is, it takes place in a small town called Xenia, Oh. Well, I live in Xenia and we do not act at all like that in the film. So maybe Harmony isn't as in touch with kids as he thinks.      Though, I would never call this film a masterpiece, I will recomend it. 7.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 June 2001","score":"","review":"       I just wanted to tell people that some of the reviewers are so in denial about this film.
