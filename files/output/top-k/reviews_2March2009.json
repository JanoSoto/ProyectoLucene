As a little boy I was a fan of the action scenes, however I didn't follow the story. Now 4 years later I have the movie on DVD and gave it a second look. Now I recognized a whole lot of movie stars like Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana, William Fichtner, Ewen Bremner, Sam Shepard, Gabriel Casseus, Kim Coates, Hugh Dancy, Orlando Bloom&#133; This war movie directed by Ridley Scott won 4 awards in 2002, of which 2 for the sound in the movie. Something I didn't even noticed 4 years ago. This time I listened very carefully, and I understood why this movie received these awards Off course gunshots, rocket impacts, helicopters&#133; sounded like the real deal. But the true beauty lies in the music, which goes perfectly along with the actions of the characters.This movie is great because of different reasons. I already explained one, the music, however there're more. First of all, the actors play there role great. You see the fear in there eyes. Delta force actors are clearly different from the Rangers. And because of the fact that the movie follows both, makes it pleasant to watch. Another reason is the subject of the movie. The war in Somalia is a subject that isn't overused like World War 2 and Vietnam. It wasn't a big war like these last to, but it lasted for a few weeks. The last reason is the story line. In the movie you follow the actions of different soldiers with different tasks in this operation. This may sound that It could cause confusion when watching it. The truth is contrary, it all falls perfectly together. I had no problem at all with all the switching of characters and locations because you can recognize the soldiers, vehicles and locations.I recommend this movie to everyone who likes a decent war movie, and is aware of the fact that war isn't like a Rambo movie. The moment that these men are in Mogadishu the story really grabs you.This movie scores 9 out of 10 for me.

Similarly, so are most movies about relationships. Why? Because as genuine and compelling as the main character's emotions seem on screen, it is almost always hallow, conventional, and, in the end, completely predictable. Movies turn love into a stage-play, in which the viewer says Aw! That was cute!, claps, then walks away and forgets all about it. I can count the movie\/books that portray love accurately, in its full non-cliché way, understanding that it means something different to everyone, on one hand. I find is amusing when people who gush about a certain romantic film, then try to form-fit their emotions around it. Or, vice versa, try to form-fit their emotions into a movie that is a total black-and-white cliché like Badlands. I'm not saying every single person is going to find nothing compelling about Badlands. I found it compelling at certain points&#151;that's human. I also realized there wasn't a single moment of the film that wasn't a generic Hollywood convention&#151;that's intelligence.A friend of mine once told me once, in defense of the entire romantic genre I love romantic movies. Who cares if they're unoriginal? Love is unoriginal. As true as this statement is, the original way love is PRESENTED and how REALISTICALLY love is presented is where I place my harsh criticism. With Badlands, the overall story is a complete rip-off of Tarzan to Bonnie and Clyde to everything in between. The only thing that has even slightly changed here is the background, and even that has been used in other generic romantic films before it. The outcome of the movie is completely predicable, as is the rest of the film. Even for its release date, Badlands is so predictable, the way it unfolds is completely second nature to the viewer. There is no suspense or mystery more than once I knew what was going to happen in 20 minutes from the scene I was watching, right down to the last detail. There is simply no excuse for a film being this basic and unoriginal. You cannot argue with me that romantic films can't be original, because they can. And when they are, that makes them infinitely better. When Bonnie and Clyde first came out, it wasn't a copy\/paste plot, it was something new. Something controversial. Because of that, it still has had a major influence on pop culture today, while Badlands is nearly obscure.Due to this predictable plot line, Badlands is possibly one of the most boring movies I've ever witnessed. I struggled to even stay awake, and giving it my attention was a downright chore. There are a few unimpressive action scenes thrown in, but even they are few and far between. Most of the runtime is spent with the characters staring at each other as if they were dying animals with mild retardation. There is absolutely no emotion here, and I fail to see how this can be touching, much less life-changing, as some have said.But it seems that is the best the renegade artists can think of Staring. Staring = love. I've written about it in a handful of other reviews, and I'm sure I'll write about it in hundreds more in the future. Staring. Instead of actually trying to create a visible emotional bond, Badlands resorts to the same method as every other cliché romantic film. Staring. Stare at me, I'll stare at you, and the audience will think we're in love, it works every time, because I have absolutely no idea how to show genuine expressions of love on film. So let's just stare. I'm sick of it. I don't have time for it. If I wanted to watch people stare at each other, I would adopt a couple kids with Down syndrome. But I didn't, I just wanted to be entertained by a movie. And do you know what is sadder than any of this? I just had to write and entire paragraph complaining about something as seemingly irrelevant as staring. If that doesn't tell you that this movie is worthless, I don't know what else will.Back on the Down syndrome subject, it seems that both main characters have it. As Forest Gump would later prove, cliché characters with slow speaking patterns never fail to pull at the audience's heartstrings. When someone can't come up with a character that actually has a personality, NEVER FEAR! Retardation is here! Though the characters in Badlands aren't necessarily mentally handicapped, they act like it. Slow speech, lack of moral judgment, lack of social judgment, lack of maturity&#151;yes, you've seen these characters in thousands of other movies. Usually I would use the metaphor that these characters are about as interesting as a dying tree, but I'll give them a little more credit. They do have a few pseudo-weird actions throughout. Thus, they're about as interesting as dying trees wearing sweater vests.No matter what good I try to find in Badlands, I simply can't. It is a 100% unoriginal mash-up of movies that came before it. Every character is a shallow Hollywood cliché, even for the time this film was made. Every compelling scene is, really, just hollow because it fails to recognize how real love works. It's more than staring. It's more than a few melodramatic We fell in love . . . monologues. Love isn't black-and-white, copy\/paste. It's sad to see it portrayed so shallowly, then gain such a cult following.Don't listen to the hyper-emotional teenage girls, or the divorced middle-aged women, or the pseudo-sensitive boyfriends Badlands is not a genuine love story. It's a stale Hollywood excuse of a love story. Imagine the relationship between your great- great-grandparents. If they still even remember each other's names, then that's about how much genuine emotion is in this film.0\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 March 2009","score":"7 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":" If there is anything that I learned from my midget ex-girlfriend with blue hair, it's that most relationships people get themselves into are a complete waste of their time.
