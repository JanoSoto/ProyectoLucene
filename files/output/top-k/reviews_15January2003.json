Both of those movies truly were horrible as was 'Shallow Hal', a film that had one of the worst pair of actors I have ever seen and boring jokes that fell flat at about 50 times per minute.I am officially done with the idiotic Farrelly brothers.  I just don't get them.  'Dumb and Dumber' was at least tolerable and so *not* annoying. That was probably their best film yet, and that's not saying a whole lot.The main problem, which probably only exists in my mind though I don't know why anyone else wouldn't see it from my point of view, is that the casting was all wrong.  Gwyneth Paltrow.  Gwyneth Paltrow a 300 pound woman?  Come on, what has happen to this gal's career?  I'm not a big Gwyneth fan, but she at least knows SOME good roles when they do, indeed, roll around. It's bad enough when Paltrow, an actress who earns millions and millions of dollars and can have the pick of probably any script, goes for a film that is as lame as this, but why, oh why would Jack Black be cast in a lead role. Somebody please explain this to me because I am having a difficult time grasping the idea of Black actually getting paid for being such a jerk. He is annoying and one of the worst so-called comedians to come around Hollywood in a while.  Never would I ever pay to see him in anything again. Not even in a film in which he has three lines.I found 'Shallow Hal' to be one of the most boring comedies I've seen in quite some time.  The supposed jokes aimed to make the audience laugh fell flat like an anvil.  I laughed....maybe twice, but I'm being generous. (Jason Alexander's performance evoked the most laughter from me.)  As bad as 'Me, Myself & Irene' was, it at least made me chuckle, despite the fact that it was asinine and seemed as if it had kids working behind the cameras.I know that a lot of people have come down hard on this film mainly because it picked at the overweight population.  Okay, what exactly is the problem? For those who ARE overweight and just find this movie to be so insulting, why don't you go out and actually do something about your weight instead of sitting around typing about it?  For the others who just didn't like it because it targeted obese folks, if you didn't want to see a movie like that, you shouldn't have gone and saw it.  I mean it's not like you didn't know what the movie was going to be about.  Alright, enough of that, let me get back on track.Well, I guess I AM done.  Gwyneth Paltrow shouldn't have signed on, Jack Black is just a jackass and if you want laughs, go rent something else, anything else.  Did the previews look good?  Obviously, or I wouldn't have gone out and coughed up a couple of bucks even though it was a complete waste of time.  The best thing about this film happened in about the last two minutes; it's where the song Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes) plays. Love that song, can't get enough of it.

And holy hell, did those 118 minutes go by slow! After about half the film, I was begging for it to end!The acting is mediocre for a horror film, but the special effects are pretty good. Eerily similar to Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING, there is everything from Kubrick's masterpiece from the crazy husband to chopping down the door with an axe. Possibly inspired by Stephen King's novel a little bit? I know it was based on a book itself, but maybe it was also inspired by King's novel a little bit (I say novel only because the movie had not yet come to be).There were some decent visual effects in here, but the script was very poorly written. It mainly consists of a bunch of people sitting around doing ordinary everyday things. There is a somewhat interesting scene about every twenty minutes or so. And even during the few parts of the film that are actually exciting, they only last about five minutes at the most.

All he really does is get in a car accident, get attacked by killer flies, and scream Our Lord Jesus Christ!! at the church ceiling really loud. His part in the film was basically pointless.

Here is an enormously underrated actor who steals the show even when he's not onscreen, so we can only hope to see a lot more of him in the future. David Duchovny is perfectly cast as the geology professor at the local city college who is on the scene to investigate a mysterious asteroid that has landed on earth and seems to have brought with it some astonishingly quickly growing and evolving organisms from an unknown origin. His history from the X-Files gives him the perfect mixture of seriousness since he just has that voice that makes anything he's talking about sound mysterious and other-worldly, and at the same time it gives him a great opportunity to make some nice inside jokes about his iconography (`I don't trust the government, I know those people.').Julianne Moore is the place where the movie really trips up. She is a tremendously talented actor, and is given a role that is immensely below her. She is there literally for no other reason than to have a love interest for Dr. Kane (Duchovny) and so that she can, for some reason, trip and fall flat on her face for some completely unknown reason every once in a while in the movie. Seann William Scott, the single reason to watch crapfests like the American Pies and Road Trip, is given a role that reduces him to goofball comic relief spouting bad jokes (`That's like a big loogie!') that are funny almost not a single time in the film. This guy was side-splittingly hilarious in some of his previous films, even the bad ones (which was most of them), and he is a hugely talented comedy actor, but he just had nothing to work with here. Maybe they should have let him write his own part.The aliens themselves are remarkably interesting, given the way they grow and evolve at such an alarming rate and the things that they grow into. There is a lot of creativity there, even though a lot of it goes way over the top and there are occasional special effects that are just not convincing enough. The idea of having the aliens being unable to tolerate oxygen was a good one, because when aliens are introduced from another world, you can't just have them running around killing people, there have to be some rules that the humans can work with in fighting them so that they're not just freaky looking bad guys. An intolerance of our atmosphere gives them character and gives the humans an edge. The way that they conducted experiments (purposely or otherwise) to see what killed the aliens was some of the more interesting parts of the movie, although their weapon against the biggest baddest aliens at the end of the film was a little too goofy, even for a movie like this.Evolution is a very rare kind of film, placing itself among very few colleagues in a genre almost entirely its own, the science fiction comedy. It has the cast to create this kind of film successfully, but some of them, mainly Julianne Moore and Seann William Scott, are simply misused and do not fulfill their entire potential. If a little more work had been put into their roles, the movie could have been immeasurably better.

Here is an enormously underrated actor who steals the show even when he's not onscreen, so we can only hope to see a lot more of him in the future. David Duchovny is perfectly cast as the geology professor at the local city college who is on the scene to investigate a mysterious asteroid that has landed on earth and seems to have brought with it some astonishingly quickly growing and evolving organisms from an unknown origin. His history from the X-Files gives him the perfect mixture of seriousness since he just has that voice that makes anything he's talking about sound mysterious and other-worldly, and at the same time it gives him a great opportunity to make some nice inside jokes about his iconography (`I don't trust the government, I know those people.').Julianne Moore is the place where the movie really trips up. She is a tremendously talented actor, and is given a role that is immensely below her. She is there literally for no other reason than to have a love interest for Dr. Kane (Duchovny) and so that she can, for some reason, trip and fall flat on her face for some completely unknown reason every once in a while in the movie.

Good stories however still exist.Now a independent film used to be one with few if any name actors, very little to no budget, no studio backing, and something different from mainstream Hollywood.

For a run down on the plot(my version doesn't give it away but informs you what kind of tale you're in for), you can check other reviews or look at the plot summary above, I will simply tell you what I liked, really liked about the film and it's few flaws. ***Possible Spoilers*** Mary B, our guide into the film and occasional narrator, called Mouse by everyone she tells us, is dropped off at the boarding school of her father's and step mother's choice.  This is the first time she is away from home and all the feelings one associates with that, timidity, reticence, alienation are explored through her.  She is housed with two other roommates, Paulie and Victoria. Paulie, speaks with a poet's heart.  She is audacious and fears no one except Victoria, who as the story progresses breaks off her physical and emotional relationship with Paulie.  The two are lovers and ultimately that is what the film is about.  Love at such a young age.  Getting over it. What happens when one person leaves another for reasons that have not to do with the heart but how people will accept you.  And how this will change you. Victoria dumps Paulie to cover up any embarrassment she may face at the hands of her sister, parents, and other schoolmates.  This is something that Paulie throughout the film refuses to accept.  In ways that some might feel comfortable just fantasizing about, Paulie tries to win her back.***END SPOILERS*** What I liked about this film is that it is fearless in the way it tells it's story.  Never going for a cheap moment, taking it's time to tell it's story and really getting into the minds of the characters and their setting. Not since The Adventures of Tom Sawyer has there been such a strong example of the main character not being the one introduced to the audience but one we stumble upon later.  Mary is the main character but Paulie is what the story ends up becoming about.  Paulie, her roomate, who has just been dumped by another girl in her all girl boarding school, takes over the story in the same fashion that Huckleberry Finn took over The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Paulie, with her strong ways, outspoken manner, and her undying resolve to win the love of her 16 year old life back helps Mary tell her own story.When is the last time you saw a film where a girl walks into a library, atop the tables no less, and quotes Shakespeare to win someone who has so firmly and repeatedly pushed her out of her life.  This film is very daring and the acting is very strong.  Piper Perabo who plays Paulie was 24 when she did this film yet looks the part of a 16 year old and plays it like a young woman coming into her own. It's also a film about a girl finding her sexual identity that did not attack men to the extreme of certain  gay themed films.  And ultimately this is a film told with enough style and substance that it puts you in another place and time for a 100 minutes.  I am not a lesbian female yet I can understand and at times relate to the characters in this film and most importantly care about them.  NOW THAT IS A GOOD FILM.  It's not a story that any studio would tackle and hence it is a very good indie film. My only problems with the film are it's overuse of music.  Music to signal the viewer what they should be feeling as opposed to being a subtle part of the story.  And abrupt music cues that take away from certain scenes as opposed to enhancing them.  Then there is the narration, which though at the end of the film is at it's strongest, begins tepid like warm water for a cup of tea.  It takes some time before it comes into its own.ALL in all I rate this film 8 out of 10 and STRONGLY recommend it if you are into films that evoke what it is like to be 16 and getting over your first love.

Some people think that just because a movie has subtitles in it, it should fall in the lone foreign flick category, but if you REALLY watched this movie, it stands by itself quite well.I was a bit apprehensive when I first sat down to watch this because it takes a bit of motivation to sit through 2 plus hours of subtitles, but within the first two minutes of the movie...I couldn't have cared less if nobody spoke at all!!The movie opens with a suspenseful chase along beautiful French countryside between a young peasant girl and some unseen evil creature. The creature's point of view was a great Sam Raimi type of fast moving first person perspective straight out of the Evil Dead films. You get a great feel of how fast the creature is gaining without spoiling the surprise by showing the beast right off the bat.I was completely expecting the same old horror death for this young woman.

Technically, Nick Nolte's the only cop, but other films have tried to imitate the style by having a tough, cranky, by-the-book cop (Nolte's character) paired off with a loose, easygoing, unorthodox cop (like Murphy's character).  Some of these imitators have failed miserably and even those that succeeded don't match up to 48 Hours.  I haven't seen the unedited version of this movie in over ten years (it plays on TV like 4 times every month), and even when I did catch it on TV, I caught it in bits and pieces.  Now that I've seen it straight-through, in its uncut form, I can regard this as an overlooked classic.  Watching Nolte as the gruff, chain-smoking Jack, I thought to myself, He owns that part.  Many actors have tried to take on that same role, but nobody plays it better than Nolte.  And the same goes for Eddie Murphy.  His talent has been taken for granted over the recent years, since his career has hit a major slump.  And rightfully so.  He should choose his roles much more wisely.  How do you from doing such fun, memorable films as 48 Hours, Coming to America and Trading Places to doing Showtime and I-Spy.  This movie proves that Murphy can go leaps and bounds with his comic talent, if the script is well-written.  The scene in the all-white, country-western bar, where Murphy shows off his skills as an interrogator, is a classic. The film is directed by Walter Hill, who's great at directing action sequences.  So the movie packs a punch in both the action and comedy department.  Nolte and Murphy's chemistry is priceless, and the banter between them is sharp and hilarious.  One of my favorite examples is when Murphy asks Nolte, Can you tell me a bedtime story?  Nolte responds, F**k you.  That's my favorite one.  Of course, Murphy gets most of the credit for being the comic relief, and he is terrific in one of his best comic performances, but Nolte belts out just as many funny lines as him, though he's the official straight man.  He never seems to say anything intentionally funny, but that's what's funny.  He says things that are hilarious, but sounds dead serious about them.  And of course, it's also hilarious to watch him react furiously to Murphy's taunts. Those who haven't seen 48 Hours should really check it out, because it's an action classic!

It is a conglomeration of Tarantino's own infatuation with the movies, as it is more about movie life than real life. One of the few little factoids that I know about Tarantino is that, like myself, he spent some time working in a video store and, like myself, spent a lot of his time watching old action films and horror films and pulp fiction films. Pulp Fiction is about the things that are in movies like that rather than real life. We have a lot of people put into extraordinary situations that do not have a lot of parallels with reality, but they are so well written and presented that we are more than willing to overlook this.One of my favorite things about Pulp Fiction is the way it presents several different storylines and mixes up the chronology of the film, which enormously increases the re-watch value. The film starts off with Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer playing a married couple who decide to rob a diner in broad daylight. The opening credits begin just as they stand up and bring out their guns, and we don't go back to this diner until more than an hour later in the film, when Vincent and Jules (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, both in possibly the greatest roles of their entire careers) finally show up after going through some serious situations of their own.Bruce Willis stars as a boxer who was supposed to go down in a big fight but killed his opponent instead, and now the bookies are after him. His absolutely adorable girlfriend, played by Maria de Medeiros, plays the part of the significant other who just doesn't understand Butch's (Willis) urgent need to leave, like right this second. This leads to some interesting situations where Butch is stuck trying to hurry her out of the house and calm her down at the same time, and we as the audience are stuck wishing that she would shut up and get the hell out of the house while at the same time wishing there was some way she could be made to feel better.One of the biggest strengths of the film is the way the stories are all tied together. Vince and Jules, for example, after paying a visit to some guys who screwed their employer, take one of them hostage, only to have Vince accidentally shoot him in the face while asking him a casual question in the car. They take the bloodied car to their friend Jimmie's (Tarantino) house, and go through one of the more amusing scenes in the film trying to get the car clean before Jimmie's wife comes home, finds a bunch a gangsters in her house doing a bunch of gangster sh*t, and divorces Jimmie. Tarantino, as has become a tradition of his, plays one of the best roles (although also one of the smallest, which is also common) in the film, as a normal guy who just wants to live a normal life without people showing up at his house at 8 in the morning with a bloody car and a dead body.Harvey Keitel shows up playing the role of The Wolf, and does his job of cleaning up messes like the one Vince and Jules have on their hands (and their clothes, and their car). Here is a guy that knows exactly what he's doing, and he works quickly and efficiently and hates to be slowed down by people who prefer politeness (`Pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the f**kin' car.'). Eventually it gets clean, the mess is solved, and in order to clear their minds (and so Jules can continue to contemplate the miracle that saved them from being shot by a guy who burst out of a closet and emptied his gun into the wall behind them at point blank range), they go to a diner to get some breakfast - the same diner that Ringo and Yolanda were robbing in the opening scene of the film. Everything that has taken place up to this point in the movie, except for the robbery itself, took place before the robbery, and now we're right back where we started.(spoilers) It takes a few viewings to really get this movie straight because it is so complex and intricate, but I'm pretty sure there are something like four or five different stories operating at the same time, and it becomes even harder to get straight because some of them mix in with other ones. Butch has to make a desperate trip back to his apartment to retrieve a wristwatch that has more than a little bit of sentimental value, and when he gets there, he finds Vincent there, once more taking on a job that's just a little over his head. Not only is this guy not able to travel with someone in the back seat without shooting him in the face, but he also seems to have a hard time staking out someone's apartment without using the bathroom and leaving his machine gun on the kitchen counter. Not the smartest character, but certainly one of the most likable that Travolta has ever played.In Pulp Fiction, the characters are not given dialogue that is meant only to further the plot. In many instances, it is there literally for no other reason than to show them having casual dialogue which often has absolutely nothing to do with the story. Jules and Vincent discuss at length the names of burgers at McDonalds' in France, the definition of a miracle, and the acceptable difference between a woman's foot and her holiest of holies. Granted, at least two of these have direct meaning to the plot, but when you see how deeply into the subjects Vince and Jules go, it becomes more and more clear that they are talking just to be talking. But the thing that really brings out the quality of the script is that no matter how long anyone goes on about one subject, it never once gets boring.All of the actors involved deliver some of the best performances of their careers, and much of the reason for this is because the roles fit them perfectly and the script is written so well. It's full of drugs, violence, blood, crime, murder, sex, and guns, but never once even approaches anything gratuitous. Things like this are very often condemned by our society, and with good reason, if they are thrown into a movie just to advance a weak story, but in Pulp Fiction there is nothing thrown in without reason and nothing that is put in to make up for weakness anywhere else. But while it does have good reason to have everything in it that's there, the film is certainly not for everyone, because even the most logically placed violence and blood and killing is going to be hard for some viewers to take, so you should be forewarned.

They take the bloodied car to their friend Jimmie's (Tarantino) house, and go through one of the more amusing scenes in the film trying to get the car clean before Jimmie's wife comes home, finds a bunch a gangsters in her house doing a bunch of gangster sh*t, and divorces Jimmie. Tarantino, as has become a tradition of his, plays one of the best roles (although also one of the smallest, which is also common) in the film, as a normal guy who just wants to live a normal life without people showing up at his house at 8 in the morning with a bloody car and a dead body.Harvey Keitel shows up playing the role of The Wolf, and does his job of cleaning up messes like the one Vince and Jules have on their hands (and their clothes, and their car). Here is a guy that knows exactly what he's doing, and he works quickly and efficiently and hates to be slowed down by people who prefer politeness (`Pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the f**kin' car.'). Eventually it gets clean, the mess is solved, and in order to clear their minds (and so Jules can continue to contemplate the miracle that saved them from being shot by a guy who burst out of a closet and emptied his gun into the wall behind them at point blank range), they go to a diner to get some breakfast - the same diner that Ringo and Yolanda were robbing in the opening scene of the film. Everything that has taken place up to this point in the movie, except for the robbery itself, took place before the robbery, and now we're right back where we started.(spoilers) It takes a few viewings to really get this movie straight because it is so complex and intricate, but I'm pretty sure there are something like four or five different stories operating at the same time, and it becomes even harder to get straight because some of them mix in with other ones. Butch has to make a desperate trip back to his apartment to retrieve a wristwatch that has more than a little bit of sentimental value, and when he gets there, he finds Vincent there, once more taking on a job that's just a little over his head. Not only is this guy not able to travel with someone in the back seat without shooting him in the face, but he also seems to have a hard time staking out someone's apartment without using the bathroom and leaving his machine gun on the kitchen counter. Not the smartest character, but certainly one of the most likable that Travolta has ever played.In Pulp Fiction, the characters are not given dialogue that is meant only to further the plot. In many instances, it is there literally for no other reason than to show them having casual dialogue which often has absolutely nothing to do with the story. Jules and Vincent discuss at length the names of burgers at McDonalds' in France, the definition of a miracle, and the acceptable difference between a woman's foot and her holiest of holies. Granted, at least two of these have direct meaning to the plot, but when you see how deeply into the subjects Vince and Jules go, it becomes more and more clear that they are talking just to be talking. But the thing that really brings out the quality of the script is that no matter how long anyone goes on about one subject, it never once gets boring.All of the actors involved deliver some of the best performances of their careers, and much of the reason for this is because the roles fit them perfectly and the script is written so well. It's full of drugs, violence, blood, crime, murder, sex, and guns, but never once even approaches anything gratuitous. Things like this are very often condemned by our society, and with good reason, if they are thrown into a movie just to advance a weak story, but in Pulp Fiction there is nothing thrown in without reason and nothing that is put in to make up for weakness anywhere else. But while it does have good reason to have everything in it that's there, the film is certainly not for everyone, because even the most logically placed violence and blood and killing is going to be hard for some viewers to take, so you should be forewarned. But the rest of you, as they say, are going to love it.

Hitchcock made some of the greatest movies ever made, and 'Vertigo', though by no means his most accessible film, is quite possibly his crowning achievement. It is without any doubt a masterpiece, and I cannot fault it in any way. Every time I watch it I am knocked out, and every time I see something new, some nuance or moment that I appreciate more than I did the previous viewing. Jimmy Stewart, one of the most popular movie star in Hollywood history, gives a remarkable performance throughout, one of the best in his career. Stewart had worked with Hitchcock before, and had always been superb, especially in the much copied suspense classic 'Rear Window' a few years prior to this, but he plays against type in 'Vertigo' and is jaw-droppingly good. It's difficult to remember now that 'Vertigo' is regarded as a movie milestone, that it received many bad reviews when it was originally released, and was a relative failure for Hitchcock. A lot of this had to do with Stewart's intense performance I think, and also the difficult subject matter. 'Vertigo' is essentially a tale of sexual obsession, something most people were probably not expecting at the time! Almost as good as Stewart is Kim Novak ('The Man With The Golden Arm') in a role that she will always be remembered for. 'Vertigo' is a virtuoso piece from Hitchcock, and a movie that will no doubt continue to inspire other film makers over the years to come. However the most important thing about it is that it is still  wonderful viewing, and a movie experience that you will never forget. In my mind it is one of the three of four greatest American movies. Simply astonishing.

There are several instances in the film where sudden shocks are delivered by things jumping onscreen with a nice shrieking sound, but these are really only there because what horror movie doesn't have these? That's a horror movie staple, but the film as a whole presents plenty of creepy and spooky stuff that goes beyond simply a lot of cheesy scares. In a lot of ways, In the Mouth of Madness is a situational horror film, which throws its characters into situations that are just horribly creepy.(spoilers) When John (Sam Niell) and Linda (Julie Carmen) are driving down a country road late at night on their way to the theoretically fictional town Hobb's End, they pass a young kid (who you will probably not recognize as a young Hayden Christensen) riding a bicycle down the middle of the street with no lights. John is asleep when this happens, and then a few seconds later they pass an old man also riding a bike down the middle of the street, this time in the opposite direction and stone-faced forward like a zombie. Linda grows concerned at this point, obviously wondering what the hell is going on, and then the next thing you know the same old man is in front of them and she hits him.So far, the movie seems to be just paying homage to Stephen King, from which it borrows heavily (what with the Children of the Corn sequence that this is), but there is something creepy about being in a strange place in the dark and suddenly seeing a bicyclist outside in the blackness, riding merrily along. The problem, however, is that the movie presents even the most creepy scenes like this, but then turns right around and trips over itself. After they run down the old man, John is obviously jolted out of sleep, they go back to see if the man's dead, and after he tells them that he's trapped and he won't let him out, he gets right up, gets on his bike, and continues on his way. This all fits with the situation and the movie's plot, but then we see John and Linda get back into the car, and not only does John not even offer to drive since Linda just ran someone down, but he gets back in the passenger seat and goes right back to sleep! What the hell!The best scenes in the movie are the ones that deal with stuff from the novels of Sutter Cane (Stephen King Sutter Cane Stephen King Sutter Cane &#150; get it?) and the way that they seem to drive people insane. The man with the axe slowly crossing a crowded street to John and his boss sitting in a café, the later revelation that that man was Cane's agent, the painting in the hotel where they stay in Hobb's End, the way John kept coming right back to the crowded street of zombies when he was trying to leave Hobb's End, etc. The movie succeeds wonderfully with this creepy stuff, but trips a little when it goes too far, as it did with some more graphic parts like that goofy pulsating door in Cane's office in the church and, more than anything else in the film, the ridiculous monster that the little old lady in the hotel turned into whenever she was spending quality time with her husband.But on the whole, In the Mouth of Madness sits comfortably within the top 5% or 10% of horror films, even the ending was satisfactory. I have a strange fascination with movies that present insanity this way, first from the point of view of the supposedly insane person, and eventually from the point of view of reality. In Dreams also did this really well. When John walks into the theater with his popcorn (but no soda, how can you possibly eat popcorn and not have soda? The guy's definitely insane!) and watches the movie that was made out of Cane's new book, he sees himself in the movie doing what we've seen him do throughout this movie, `This is reality,' `I'm not insane,' etc. Everything that he did that was a little nuts throughout the entire movie is edited together, and John sits there watching fascinated like a child and then slowly goes off into rolling laughter, and you just have to grin.Movies and books are supposed to get into your head, but only the best ones do.

There are certain things I didn't understand about the plot, which I have to give another look at, but for the most part I didn't find it too complicated.  I just wonder if Michael Keaton really could've gotten away with doing what he did, even if he didn't fill out an application and wasn't officially granted the right to rent the apartment.  It seems very strange, but then again I don't know s**t about s**t when it comes to the law.  Maybe someone with much more legal expertise might view the film differently and jot down a few flaws.  Then again, the truth can be stranger than fiction and maybe Keaton would've gotten away with that little con game.  All I know is that when Melanie Griffith got revenge on him in that hotel, I was laughing with delight (However, I really doubt a maid will just let someone into a room, who's claimed she lost her key, just like that).  My only major criticism is Matthew Modine.  I've never seen him in a bad performance previous to this, but for some reason he slept through this role and recited his lines like he was in a coma.  Then again, I rarely see Modine get angry in the roles he played (since he usually plays the nice-guy pretty boy), so maybe that's an emotion he has problems expressing, because he certainly couldn't express it in this film.  Keaton, on the other hand, is great as I expected.  He is one of our fine, underrated actors who unfortunately drifted off in recent years.  But I enjoyed him as the villain in Desperate Measures, and I enjoyed him as the villain in Pacific Heights as well.  The ending is the conventional duke-it-out climax, and I really wish it could've ended on a much less cliched note, but other than that, this is pretty much a first-class thriller.

When this came out, I was understandably very excited. Never have I felt the same excitement about a film as I did when this came out.Of course the film is by no means a classic. It was a relatively high budget by mid eighties standards, being 17 million. This was still fairly cheap in terms of recreating the worlds of Masters of the Universe, hence most of it was set on Earth as opposed to Eternia. Other gripes would be, no Orco, no battle cat but He Man purists could go on. The changes that the designers made were generally well recieved. The darker more gothic look with the costumes, I thought He Mans costume was really good.The cast are good. Dolph Lundgren is perfectly cast as He-man on the physical side of things, and for his debut he isn't half bad, he's good hero material and his physical exploits make up for his lack of acting ability. He has however improved immensely since this movie and I have been a Dolph fan since, thanks mainly to the fact that he portrayed my childhood hero. Meg Foster is excellent and strangely sexy as Evil Lynn and James Tolkan is as usual very good too, but it is Frank Langellas superbly evil performance as Skelator. Skelator gets all the best lines and Langella revels in his role, with his performance shining through heavy make up.The sets that have been built are good, particularly Greyskulls interior, which at the time was one of the largest sets ever built. This is all harmless and camp fun with a superbly uplifting musical score from Bill Conti and despite not being a very good film in the critical sense it is fun and I love it. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 January 2003","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  Like many people of my sort of age bracket, when I was younger I was obsessed with He-man, the cartoons, toys and whatever else.
