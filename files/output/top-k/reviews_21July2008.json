After watching them both I can say they haven't dated one bit. For its time Superman was a very expensive project and you can see why, the special effects are outstanding and still look terrific even today in the days of CGI. Then there was the cast, Marlon Brando(he demanded a very grand sum for a small part as Jor El),Trevor Howard,Gene Hackman and Glenn Ford. I didn't mention Christopher Reeves and Margot Kidder in the previous sentence because they weren't huge stars before it but Superman gave them their big break but borh would never get success again after Superman. The theme tune by John Williams is one of my favourites along with Star Wars,Raiders of the lost ark and Jurrasic Park. Superman was the first movie adaptation of a comic book superhero(not counting the campy made for TV Batman) and paved the way for other Superhero adaptations, for instance Batman(1989), X Men, Spiderman and many more. It is a real shame that Superman 3, Superman 4 and Superman Returns could not match the brilliance of the first two. Superman brings back very fond memories of a pleasant childhood and can still be enjoyed and appreciated by the younger generation who didn't grow up with the Superman movies.

Austin Powers in Goldmember, Mike Myers's third incarnation of his gormless but irrepressible swinging sixties British spy, really is pretty funny.After three movies and six years of the shagadelic, flouncy-shirted, buck-toothed homunculus and his ever-expanding cartoon world, it's become easier to surrender than resist. Place it against Men in Black or Mr. Deeds or any of a host of other barren summer comedies and the difference is obvious Myers's sheer fertility of invention is of a different order, and even if he misses as often as he hits, he's definitely a swinger.Even if the gag-to-wince ratio isn't high, there are enough punchlines thrown here to make a sphinx smirk. Father, forgive me, I must confess I sprayed my popcorn.Powers, the self-adoring spy whom Myers says he invented one day while riding back from hockey practice and listening to Dusty Springfield sing The Look of Love on the radio, is not so much a spy spoof (the sixties were already crawling with spy spoofs) as nostalgic sixties anglophilia Think of it as James Bond crossed with the Carry-On Gang, or maybe Jerry Lewis imagining he's Cary Grant. The character(s) -- Myers plays four parts here, three of them villains -- finds that tightrope between enviable childish narcissism and obnoxiousness where much comedy struts.The successor to the massive success of the $200-million second instalment of the series, The Spy Who Shagged Me, starts off with a large bang, and not, this time, of the sexual nature. Instead, it's a series of scenes from a film within the film, featuring a cast of stars way too famous to be named and an action stunt that should make the James Bond franchise pack up its product placements and go home.Dr. Evil, Myers's best character, with his pinky-chewing and air quote signs and poor ability at higher numbers, takes centre stage early. Having found a way of taking his unscrupulous behaviour into legitimate business by taking over a Hollywood agency business (he charges just 9 per cent instead of the usual 10), he's stationed himself in a lair above the Hollywood sign and is concocting one of his usual plans to blackmail the world's leaders for a largish amount of money.The entire evil cast (with the exception of the bald cat, Mr. Bigglesworth, who seems to have dropped out between trailer and movie) is back -- Dr. Evil's annoying son, Scott (Seth Green); Dr. Evil's silent clone, Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), who proves he has a mind of his own, and the rest of the Evil cast, including Number Two (Robert Wagner) and Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling). Myers hides himself under a couple of tonnes of makeup as an obese Scotsman, Fat Bastard, who is in love with his own body effluents.Myers also plays a new Dutch villain called Johann Van Der Smut, a middle-aged seventies playboy nicknamed Goldmember (regrettable smelting accident), who enjoys roller-skating, disco dancing and eating strips of his overtanned skin.The best piece of casting falls on the side of good, with Michael Caine as Nigel, Austin's swinging, and insufficiently paternal, spy dad. Caine (who himself played a bespectacled spy in The Ipcress File) looks the part, and turns on some real actor intensity, especially in his raging declaration that he hates intolerance and Dutch people.Austin, for some reason, has to travel back to swinging Manhattan to Studio 69, to rescue his dad, who has been captured by the evil Van Der Smut. There, he teams up with Pam Grier-inspired Foxxy Cleopatra, played by pop diva Beyoncé Knowles of Destiny's Child, who has great abs and a way of looking at Austin as if she just scraped him off the bottom of her platform shoes.There's no doubt that Goldmember has its long flaccid stretches, and a good deal of repetition of familiar gags shadow play, inadvertently obscene subtitles and an assortment of euphemisms for genitalia. At times, Myers's toilet-bowl humour overfloweth.The strategy here is the basic Mel Brooks string o' gags school of comedy. While it's not high wit, it never stops trying and, occasionally, as in the prison-rap number inspired by Hard Knock Life from Annie, the results are inspired.A flashback to Austin and Dr. Evil's early days at the Intelligence Academy, for example, shows a savvy such scenes rarely manage; the young actors are close enough physically to the adult characters, but what makes it work is Myers's dubbing in their adult voices.Fourth-time Austin Powers is a spectre that can only arouse apprehension. No one can look forward to a bigger role for Van Der Smut (or bigger rolls for Fat Bastard). Who cares if Mini-Me decides to talk?

There's the high art, for example the paintings of Zdzisław Beksiński, or the writings of China Meivile. There's really popular stuff, that is really well crafted and deserves it's popularity, let's say the work of Stephen King, Wes Craven's films, old EC Comics etc. And then there's the pure pulp, the Friday the 13ths and the Sleepaway Camps. They are all great depending on what mood you may be in. (I also feel that it can be mixed with other genres much more successfully. Sci Fi-Aliens. Period Piece-The Others. Comedy-Shaun of the Dead.

Not everyone is going to enjoy it, but nothing that anyone can say will adequately describe such a purely cinematic film. Its cinematic excellence is all the more impressive when you consider that Lindsay Anderson is mostly a theater director. One of the most striking things about the movie is the intensely realistic style of the beginning, which almost makes you feel like you actually attended a British boarding school. But then the film at a certain point goes into a satiric direction, at which point the cinematic style also becomes very surreal. In my opinion that isn't a clash or a lack of proportion, it's actually a cinematic depiction of a certain dialectic or progression that Anderson is trying to address in the film. Basically I think the film is saying that if you pile realism upon realism, eventually what you will end up with is something surreal. For example, this is almost literally depicted in the Colonel's speech close to the very end. At first he's giving the speech, and you hear a few coughs in the audience which doesn't really disturb us, it just seems like a realistic touch because anytime you see someone give a speech a few people will cough, although you rarely hear it in a movie. But then gradually we start to hear more and more coughing, and we see smoke rising up from below the stage. At this point everything becomes very chaotic and panic sets in. The whole process of the movie is basically like this. The very same realistic elements that we accept in the early scenes for documentary value become by way of repetition so thoroughly absurd that the surreal style of the last 1\/3 of the movie is an appropriate way to depict the truth of what we've been experiencing.That's also why I've never been able to fully believe that the movie is mixed black and white with color just for economic reasons, which a lot of people claim. Even if literally true, most directors would just cut a few scenes out and finish the film in color. Anderson is the type of true genius who uses it instead as a strength. There's no clear dichotomy between why a particular scene should be in color while this other is in black and white, but the device does make the audience wonder and think about whether it could be for some particular reason while they're watching it, which engages them on a deeper level. Also switching back and forth brings out the beauty of both the black and white and the color process. The whole movie could have been color or it could have been black and white, but halfway through it our eyes would adjust to the scheme and we'd start getting lazy. This technique has the effect of constantly drawing our attention to the details in the film and the beauty of the film as literal representation of photographic detail.Malcolm McDowell was cast in A Clockwork Orange based on his performance in this movie, and you can see why. But this performance has many more different dimensions to it than his work for Kubrick. Here he sometimes sulks, he sometimes is exultant with the pure physical joys of life, he sometimes wonders about the larger significance of things (as when he views another student's telescope) and he sometimes is insolent and angry. It's remarkable how he's able to hold it all together. The rest of the cast, mostly Anderson regulars who also worked with him in the theater, hold up their parts of the film very well also. In particular I enjoy the homosexual relationship between Richard Warwick and Rupert Webster. The scene in the gymnasium is a stunning display of editing and photographic beauty. The whole thing is handled in a non-sensationalist way that directly contrasts with the homosexual flirtation between the whips and the scum which is really nothing but an expression of their sexual repression.The ending, indeed the entire film, can be easily misconstrued if one watches it strictly as drama. It's not holding up Travis as a hero or even saying his actions are justified. You could compare it to the apocalypse at the end of Dr. Strangelove, but Lindsay Anderson seems to have more respect for human emotion in and of itself than Kubrick does. It's not satirizing just our institutions, but the way that we as individuals give ourselves wholly over to them, so that even the rebels end up caught in institutionalized patterns of punishment and reward.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"21 July 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" First of all, as a longtime fan of this movie and the Mick Travis series (continued with Anderson's O Lucky Man! and Britannia Hospital), we can all be glad that it's finally out on DVD and it's a very nice presentation.If you're reading this hoping for a recommendation, just stop reading and watch it, then come back. Not everyone is going to enjoy it, but nothing that anyone can say will adequately describe such a purely cinematic film. Its cinematic excellence is all the more impressive when you consider that Lindsay Anderson is mostly a theater director. One of the most striking things about the movie is the intensely realistic style of the beginning, which almost makes you feel like you actually attended a British boarding school. But then the film at a certain point goes into a satiric direction, at which point the cinematic style also becomes very surreal. In my opinion that isn't a clash or a lack of proportion, it's actually a cinematic depiction of a certain dialectic or progression that Anderson is trying to address in the film. Basically I think the film is saying that if you pile realism upon realism, eventually what you will end up with is something surreal. For example, this is almost literally depicted in the Colonel's speech close to the very end. At first he's giving the speech, and you hear a few coughs in the audience which doesn't really disturb us, it just seems like a realistic touch because anytime you see someone give a speech a few people will cough, although you rarely hear it in a movie. But then gradually we start to hear more and more coughing, and we see smoke rising up from below the stage. At this point everything becomes very chaotic and panic sets in. The whole process of the movie is basically like this. The very same realistic elements that we accept in the early scenes for documentary value become by way of repetition so thoroughly absurd that the surreal style of the last 1\/3 of the movie is an appropriate way to depict the truth of what we've been experiencing.That's also why I've never been able to fully believe that the movie is mixed black and white with color just for economic reasons, which a lot of people claim. Even if literally true, most directors would just cut a few scenes out and finish the film in color. Anderson is the type of true genius who uses it instead as a strength. There's no clear dichotomy between why a particular scene should be in color while this other is in black and white, but the device does make the audience wonder and think about whether it could be for some particular reason while they're watching it, which engages them on a deeper level. Also switching back and forth brings out the beauty of both the black and white and the color process. The whole movie could have been color or it could have been black and white, but halfway through it our eyes would adjust to the scheme and we'd start getting lazy. This technique has the effect of constantly drawing our attention to the details in the film and the beauty of the film as literal representation of photographic detail.Malcolm McDowell was cast in A Clockwork Orange based on his performance in this movie, and you can see why. But this performance has many more different dimensions to it than his work for Kubrick. Here he sometimes sulks, he sometimes is exultant with the pure physical joys of life, he sometimes wonders about the larger significance of things (as when he views another student's telescope) and he sometimes is insolent and angry. It's remarkable how he's able to hold it all together. The rest of the cast, mostly Anderson regulars who also worked with him in the theater, hold up their parts of the film very well also. In particular I enjoy the homosexual relationship between Richard Warwick and Rupert Webster. The scene in the gymnasium is a stunning display of editing and photographic beauty. The whole thing is handled in a non-sensationalist way that directly contrasts with the homosexual flirtation between the whips and the scum which is really nothing but an expression of their sexual repression.The ending, indeed the entire film, can be easily misconstrued if one watches it strictly as drama. It's not holding up Travis as a hero or even saying his actions are justified.

It is not their funniest film in my opinion. Some of the jokes are even recycled from previous movies. I remember that the moving candle gag was in Hold That Ghost. What makes this movie one of Bud and Lou's best outings is that the monsters were really taken seriously by the writers and the actors. Bela Lugosi, Lon Chaney Jr., and Glenn Strange all give it their best here. This was actually Bela Lugosi's second and last time he played Dracula on screen, contrary to popular belief. The sheer absurdity of the monsters terrifying Costello, and Abbott's belief that Costello is just crazy, makes for an hour and forty minutes worth of great entertainment! The movie starts with the premise that Dracula is the new master of the Frankenstein monster. For reasons not explained, the monster is growing weaker and weaker, and Dracula intends to revive it by putting Costello's brain in its body, making it the perfect slave. Abbott and Costello have to deliver Dracula and the monster (they assume they're wax dummies) to the McDougal House of Horrors. From there, hilarity ensues from Costello's encounters with the monsters, which conveniently take place without Abbott. Lenore Aubert, who plays Dracula's partner Sandra, seduces Costello in front of a jealous Abbott, attempting to get him to come to Dracula's castle. Lawrence Talbot (the Wolfman) plays the role of the vampire hunter and helps Abbott rescue Costello before Dracula can perform the operation. None of Bud and Lou's future monster outings reached this level of quality. The writing was just not as clever, and the monsters were not as iconic. It is hard to beat Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein! The only other monster movie I would recommend is Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man. Funnily enough, Lou Costello thought the script was just too stupid at first. I believe it took his mother (or maybe his wife) to convince him that it was really good. Trivia fact That's Vincent Price as the Invisible Man at the end of the movie. I only wish he could have returned in Bud and Lou's Invisible Man movie!

You know, before this movie came out, boys were actually able to go on dates with girls without constantly trying to contrive a way to get into their pants. It sickens me that some perverted man would put out a movie like this and basically ruin the dating life of all the generations that came after. Had I only seen this movie as a teenage girl, I would have understood the intentions of boys. Of course, boys didn't always think this way. There was a time when a boy was ecstatic if he simply got to hold a girl's hand. This movie convinced boys that if they weren't trying to get laid, they were doing something wrong. Sex was treated very casually in Fast Times. One of the girls was a virgin and the other girls pressured her to go ahead and have sex. They acted like they had been doing it for years already. It just sickens me that teenagers were portrayed this way. What kind of a monster produces a movie like this and then puts it out there for the world to see?

There is one thing this film suffers from more than any other of its drawbacks, and that is a disease amongst the film industry known simply as Badfilmmakingitis. What, pray tell, could have caused this? And what are its symptoms? They differ from film to film.Symptom # 1 A clear knowledge that this island holds no real danger towards our heroes. Symptom # 2 The broken family which pulls together for the happy ending. Symptom # 3 Continuity errors regarding its predecessors. Symptom # 4 One word overkill. Symptom # 5 That God-awful and down right ridiculous idea to have the satellite phone ringing from inside the Spinosaurus-a-gypsy-curse. Symptom # 6 Deciding to cast All Out Action in favour of Tension. Symptom # 7 The family friendly rating and content. If there's actually just one good thing to take away from this film it is this the creatures themselves. Ingen's bad doings have been giving us resurrected dinosaurs since 1993 and with each outing they've looked better and better. They have been created quite beautifully in a mix of practical props and CGI fabrications. Their movements are undeniably majestic, even at their most hectic. But it is not enough to recover from the hour and half you'll undoubtedly feel somewhat insulted after.

In my opinion, that sixth film in the franchise isn't very good overall, and Lazenby's version of the character is forgettable. After that one, Connery returned for one last official Bond film before Roger Moore took over, which was this one, Diamonds Are Forever. While he still fit the role, this seventh official Bond adaptation, like the one before it, is somewhat disappointing.After it appears James Bond, Agent 007, has succeeded in killing Ernst Stavro Blofeld, he is soon sent on another mission. He is told about the South African diamond mines, and how diamonds from them have recently been mysteriously disappearing. It is suspected that this is a case of diamond smuggling, so Bond is sent undercover as a diamond smuggler named Peter Franks to Holland, where he meets another smuggler named Tiffany Case. He must gather information and find out who's responsible for this smuggling operation, and his investigations take him from Holland to America. Continuing the mission here, it turns out that Blofeld himself is once again the head of a sinister plot, and Bond faces a number of life-threatening situations as he once again tries to track down his foe! Like On Her Majesty's Secret Service, this seventh official Bond film is somewhat tedious, and that's not its only problem. Early in the film, when Bond is told about the South African diamond mines and how they work, we are shown a bunch of clips. This part is like watching an educational documentary, and I doubt too many people watch these films to see something like that. Right after that sequence, the film introduces two new villains, Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, and I found these characters maybe a tad annoying, even though they're apparently supposed to be funny, and Bruce Glover and Putter Smith put on rather poor performances as them. After that, there's some occasional excitement, such as the elevator fight, but there's certainly not enough of it. There's also a bit of humour, such as Tiffany Case saying My G*d! You just killed James Bond! to the man she doesn't know is actually him, the scene with Tiffany playing the water balloon game with a bunch of kids, and what Bond says after he manages to escape from a pipe. However, this movie is still usually boring, and may seem like an abnormally long two hours.Like many times before, I'm not 100% sure about my rating for this movie. I feel I might be able to give it a 6\/10 instead of a 5 (there MIGHT be enough suspense in the film for that), but no higher, and the highest I've ever given a Bond flick is 9, which I gave to Goldfinger. (Speaking of Goldfinger, like that film, Shirley Bassey did the theme song for Diamonds Are Forever, but it's not as memorable as her first Bond theme.) However, like many other viewers, I still found this particular Bond flick disappointing, despite the return of Sean Connery. I would say most of the films in the official franchise starring Connery are decent, the best one probably being the classic Goldfinger, and I can see why he was so popular in the role, but it's a shame it had to end with this film, possibly the worst of Connery's official Bond films.

Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott, focuses on a stylized, retro-future Los Angeles where everything is not well. This film presents a dramatic landscape of the future with no certain explication on how we got to this point. All that is explained is that human replicants have been born from immense breakthroughs in technology, and that other than their increased strength and intelligence, are indistinguishable from their human counterparts. Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, is a retired member of an elite squad known as Blade Runners, whose purpose is to hunt down rogue replicants and destroy them. And such is the scenario that Scott presents us with as he takes us on a journey to the very core of meaning and existence.The film's breathtaking imagery and its incredible sound bolster this raw journey as Deckard reluctantly hunts down a group of replicants. We are placed in the context of this world, less knowledgeable than the fictional characters, and we are not pushed to believe that one side is more righteous or more deserving of life. Deckard's pursuit of the wanted replicants takes us through a character study or character studies of not just Deckard but the replicants too, mainly the leader, Roy Batty played by Rutger Hauer. The performances are outstanding by a great cast, additionally including the likes of Sean Young, Daryl Hannah and Edward Olmos. Through the blend of these great performances, we see these characters for what they are and how they truly exist, be they human or replicant. There are a few twists along the way that I do not want to spoil but the film slowly builds to a haunting and powerful climax.And that is an important part of the experience of viewing Blade Runner that it is slow. By no means is this an action-packed film like a, shall we say, Terminator Judgment Day. But this film is so strong and smart in what it presents that the pace of the film is not only unnoticeable but incredibly artistic. And it separates itself from the rest of the sci-fi pack with its phenomenal aesthetic artistry. The retro-future noir style of Los Angeles is captured beautifully and lends greater credibility to the plot and the characters. Through the dark and noir setting, we are given a bleak glimpse into the future, that seems rather plausible and palpable even in our present day.Let me be honest as I conclude here. When I first saw this film, I didn't really enjoy it. I didn't appreciate it that much and I was left rather disappointed. However, upon my repeated viewings, this film continued to grow on me and presented me with new challenges and questions each time. And that is part of the magic of the enigmatic Blade Runner. It can show us something different every time without us truly understanding it every time. With that said, it has now become one of my favorite films of all time.

The only thing I can say with out fear to mistake is that this is one of the few movies that I can sit and watch over and over and over and over again. I can easily say that I watch it over 100 times in the 2001.Its right now that I realize the hard work and the magnitude of the production of a movie like this.The Tom Hanks performance is the heart of the success of this movie. He create one of the most charming characters on the history. He lived the horrors that many suffer in that years tanks to the American ambition and trough is eyes everything looks just fine. Through his eyes everything seems so beautiful. The way Forrest live his life his kinda lesson to my own life.The movie itself is a wonder creation. This is the kind of Beautiful films that deserve the Best Picture Oscar and deserve to be remembered. The conflict between Forrest and Schindler will continue. Till then, I have two number one.Thats it.

Masters of The Universe has so little that is actually taken from the original cartoon series, or the action figures for that matter. Sure the names are the same on the lead characters, their world is mentioned, Castle Grayskull is in tact but where does it go from there? There is no battlecat, there is no Prince turning into He-Man in secret, instead the writers and\/or film makers chose to take Masters of The Universe in a strange and rather typical eighties way and bring it to earth. Now in some ways this is a cool idea but overall it kind of kills the whole Masters of The Universe idea. Pile on top of that they rip their Eternian minions right out of Star Wars and aren't apologetic about it at all. There are some very good things about Masters of The Universe, part of the reason why it is a cult classic and an absolutely favorite to some.Dolph Lundgren probably actually gives one of his best performances, following Ivan Drago in Rocky IV as He-Man himself. I mean the role is campy as anything but Lundgren is obviously taking it dead serious and that is just fun. I would have loved to have seen him try to the whole dual identity of Prince Adam and He-Man but they scrapped that entirely. Still he looks awesome as the blond hair, muscle rippling hero with the sword. And when he belts out I have the power! well it's just movie magic. Frank Langella probably gives the best performance in the film as the wickedly evil Skeletor. He looks awesome and plays the role brilliantly. Probably one of the more faithful characters carried over from the cartoon series. He isn't used as much as I would have hoped but the final battle between him and He-Man is excellent. Meg Foster is also pretty darn good as Skeletor's right hand woman Evil-Lyn. She looks the part and is really truly a great bad girl nemesis. She isn't used as much as she should be either. Jon Cypher and Chelsea Field are the father\/daughter duo Man-At-Arms and Teela ported from the cartoon. They bother look their roles and they do a decent supporting job but they are left as very under developed characters unfortunately. Courteney Cox and Robert Duncan McNeill are the earth couple that get caught in the cross fire of Eternia's inter-dimensional battle. They really get all the focus on their characters and that is really unfortunate. I mean they both are good in their roles but we don't wanna see earth characters we don't know compared to Skeletor and He-Man and all the other amazing characters we grew up with. 80's character actor phenomenon James Tolkan brings his typical role to Masters of The Universe as tough no nonsense cop Detective Lubic. His role is exactly the same as the one that made him famous you're nothing but a slacker McFly. And finally you have Billy Barty playing the little knome like creature Gwildor who is an okay character especially for kids but why in the hell did he not play Orco? WHERE WAS ORCO?!? He was my favorite and would have made this film substantially better!! So we have a strong cast and overall the special effects are actually very good for their time. Plenty of laser fights with the complete Darth Vadar rip off minions, sword battles, flying vehicles, explosions, and a few creatures as well. But imagine the incredible host of strange creatures they could have used from the TV Series. Skunkor, Mer-Man, Buzz Off, and the ones they did use hardly got any screen time like Beast Man and Saurod. First time director Gary Goddard obviously cared very little for the enormous fan base around He-Man and cared very little about re-creating that world in live action because that is still every He-Man fan's fantasy to this day. It is said that star Lundgren worked with Goddard to re-tool some of the action scenes and He-Man's role and in that way he might have saved this from being a complete disaster. Like many 80's films I think this one has a place in many of our hearts and will always be a guilty little classic but as far as bringing He-Man to life you'll only get a smidgen of what could have been done. Rumor has another one in the works, let's hope they do it right. Still see this one for all it's crazy campy glory because it's not the worst thing out there. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 July 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I think the biggest problem with Masters of The Universe is not that it is incredible cheesy with a sub par cast, not the best story, and an overall attempt at being serious that comes off laughable...it's the fact that Masters of The Universe strays so incredibly far from it's origins.
