I unfortunately didn't get to see the movie in theaters, but, I did rent it on DVD and while I rented it I must have watched it about five times or once a day while I had it. And upon returning it, I went out and bought it. Alan Ball wrote an amazing script because I thought this film was very original, it was a type of film that I, personally, had never seen before. American Beauty was also a hilarious movie. Several scenes had me laughing more than I had ever laughed before during a movie. One scene in particular which had Angela (Mena Suvari who is the funniest) and Jane (Thora Birch) talking with two other ditzy teenagers as Angela tells them of her little escapade with a photographer from Elle Magazine. Angela and one of the other teenagers say a few choice words to each other. I don't know what it was about that short scene, but it had me laughing and not many movies can do that for me. I do have female friends who really hate that scene for what was said (not to mention the film as a whole) but you have to admit, it was still hilarious what *was* said. It's also very dramatic in a few scenes, one in particular was with Carolyn (Annette Benning) as a women who is obsessed with being strong and on top, it happens when she is unable to sell the house she very much wanted to sell that day, and it just killed her. It's a bit disturbing, but very called for. If you do watch this film you can get some of the best film quotes in history especially from Kevin Spacey's character Lester. You can see most of them in the memorable quotes section. I also think the reason why there is also just has many people who hate this movie as like it, is the fact that there are people like the characters in this movie out there who can be just the person next door and there are people who live lives similar to the characters and do the things they do, like the issues over adultery, homosexuality, drugs, masturbation and the list goes on.

Fair enough we live in this day and age where computers are the biggest thing to have hit, and the internet is the most easily accessible source of info. in the world, and the premise is one which almost happened. Microsoft after all were taken to court and sued over their attempt to erradicate any other software companies production. In that sense the film is correct and Robbins character is obviously Bill Gates, but the plot holes are so frequent that aside from the moviegoer who enjoys cruise control in the cinema, this film will hardly be applauded.For all its plotting ineptities, and an under sophistication of what a difficult line of work computer programming is, it is a fairly enjoyable romp. It gives Ryan Phillipe a chance to do his best James Bond impression, and the when there is a chance for a thrilling set piece the director (Howitt) certainly knows which buttons to press. However, the cliff hanging moments do tend to be the same one played over and over again.It is very apparent that a lot has been lost in the editing room, even though the movie still runs at almost 2 hours. There are at least 2 sub-plots which are lost from the trailer and any number of scenes.The movies major problem is that it thinks it is being so clever by playing with such a topical idea that it is unconcerned with the fact that an idea will not stand up by itself. I am mixed on this film because, as I have said before, although it is plotted badly, overlong, and a little slow it is still very watchable. Perhaps that is due to the male lead who is very watchable, or perhaps there is something in here that after repeated viewings may make more sense and give it broader appeal.

The idea of a reality show based on one man's life and following each and every of his moves was brilliant, especially when you consider how millions of viewers are attracted to today's reality programs, such as Survivor.  I believe this movie alone may have paved the way for some of today's shows and were inspired by real-life shows that preceded the film, most notably MTV's The Real World. When it's done properly, you get a movie which centers around a man who begins to question what is real in life and what's not as the world that he is raised in begins to unravel.  Two major problems, however, plagued what could have been an instant classic.The first is the lifeless reactions of the viewers.  To me, the film portrays the viewers mostly as people who sacrifice their own lives to watch someone else's.  Now I know this is true in the lives of millions, but even for a phenomenon like The Truman Show, a show will also have millions of critics, although not as many as there are supporters.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I saw there was only one standout skeptic who understood the whole thing, and there were many more who shared the same views but were not seen or heard at all.The second and the most unforgivable error was the ending, which I felt was an anti-climatic conclusion to a movie that built up a great deal of drama before it.  The ending was terribly written and did not have much depth or thought into it, and its closure was much more predictable than it should've been.  I'm not asking for much;  I just wanted a final conflict featuring the best and worst of both sides, which I felt didn't happen.All in all, a 7 rating in my opinion may be a bit sympathetic, but I felt they did everything else so well, only that it deserved better.  It featured Jim Carrey expanding his talent and playing his role almost to a tee, backed by a strong supporting cast, and featured a good plot outline and great scenery.

Out-of-Towers is one of the B-movies. Playing 459 times this month on all the Bad B-movie channels, Steve Martin plays a watered down Neal Page from Planes, Trains and Automobiles, a much superior movie. Goldie Hawn plays a bimbo with smarts again, but one thing that was neat about her role is that they acknowledge her age and over-the-hill sex appeal that someone like Richard Gere still hasn't figured out. John Cleese reprises p****d-off hotel manager Basil Fawlty from the very funny BBC show Falwty Towers and gets a good amount of laughs, even if one is a cheap cross-dressing joke. Plus its great to see the Kids in Hall star Mark McKinny get slapped by one of his his mentors, Python's Cleese. Do some laundry, dishes, sort through your video collection like I did; it has some good moments. Not a great movie, but ok to watch maybe once.  Average C-. 6.8 of of 10.

Depends on how you look at it.I liked the first one, and really didn't expect too much out of this one. I mean let's face it, Hollywood kills movies with sequels. Where to start on this one. I will say this much, the action is good, but sometimes over done. Computer enhancing is often times used in movies today, I mean let's face it, almost all movies. But in this one it is so obvious some of the enhanced images.Then you have the whole Rock, Dwayne Johnson role in the movie. The movie has been built up to appeal to wrestling fans, boasting of The Rock being in the movie. My being a wrestling fan played into my going to see this. But what does he really do in this movie? He's in the first scene and has one line, three words in the Egyptian language. Then he's sort of in the last scene, by sorta I mean his face is enhanced on the body of a scorpion.And this tatoo thing with the main character, played by Brendan Fraser. All of the sudden, after a previous movie, Ardeth Bay (the protector from the first movie who helps Fraser) notices a tatoo by Fraser's wrist that means he's a magi and protector of the world. Fraser claims to have gotten the tatoo in an orphanage at a young age, so where was this tatoo in the first movie.On top of this, no orginal actions scenes. They are all ripped off of many movies, such as Bond, and even the first Mummy movie. Not to mention the popular Hollywood trend of ripping of Matrix in fight scenes. Oh yeah, that reminds me, since when did Evie become so bad? In the first one the last thing she knows how to do is fight, and in this won you would think she was one Charlies Angel's.In closing, I hated it. The only enjoyable aspect was the Alex, the son of Fraser. He made for some good laughs. ","genre":null},{"date":"10 May 2001","score":"","review":"  WARNING!!!
