But it still was a wasted opportunity of what could have been a really good film. Before this movie, the Final Fantasy CGI cutscenes were really cool to sit through have reaching certain points in the video game. However it doesn't really work in movie form. As a matter of fact, this would have worked fine as a video game. With more development with the background, more in-depth with the with the story and the characters and such. But it doesn't really work when if feels like your watching a really slow video game with characters trying to collect items to achieve something. I really liked the stylish and cool futuristic design of the world created in this. It's actually one of the coolest sci-fi design I have seen in a movie. The CGI was topnotch when it came to a animated movie and the effects still even hold up today. A lot of effort was put into this film, with top of the line technology to achieve the visuals. I mean just look at the facial animation. Although the dialogue is flat, it didn't get super corny either. But that is basically the only positive things I can say about this movie. It's a shame that this movie cost as much as a Pixar movie to make, but far from it being a box office hit like Pixar films. And there are reasons for that, because although it's a CGI animated movie it will not appeal to little kids. Mainly because they won't be able to understand what is exactly going on, even some adults might get confused with this. Despite it having a really straightforward and simple story, which isn't a good thing. This is just my opinion, but this movie was taken too seriously. A bit of good humor then and there amongst the characters and situation would have made it at least more gratifying to sit through. Despite the serious situation the characters are in, but I think it would have worked. Overall this movie is a wasted potential. However if you are a fan of the Final Fantasy or anime this might be worth a watch. I think Hironobu Sakaguchi is a good game director, but his efforts to make a full length movie faltered. I could tell what direction he was trying to go with this. And it might have worked if it went in a full Japanese direction or an anime with 12 episodes or so to flesh things out. Nice effort though.6.4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"5 August 2015","score":"","review":" For a movie based on a video game franchise, it wasn't atrocious.

With big action, sly humour and of course top acting from Harrison Ford, it is hard not to dislike this movie and it's many qualities. That all said I do still feel this is slightly overrated, not in a way where I think it is bad and others good, only that I feel it is not the most perfect film ever.As said Harrison Ford is our star man playing well Indiana Jones, he makes the archaeologist look like an action man and also can have a few laughs too, just don't involve snakes. As for the rest of the cast well it kind of splits, Karen Allen I wasn't so sure on, she isn't bad but I just couldn't believe her well enough. Actors such as Paul Freeman, John Rhys-Davis and Ronald Lacey make it even more fun and also sinister, the film knows how to get the right balance of good and evil.As for the man directing the whole thing, Steven Spielberg, well for me he does a good job but not a great job, he is consistent but I didn't think it was overly awesome. And now for what I consider this movies biggest flaw, the script. It is just not that good and although fans of the movies will say that it is what makes this so good, I can only disagree as I feel the whole story from George Lucas is the best thing, not the screenplay from Lawrence Kasdan. And on that, the story, and what a gem of a plot we have here, unravels nicely but never gets too slow, the action is well timed and the comedy in-between is unique.With the script maybe being my only problem, then the score is just a little chip in the whole work, a kind of slight inconvenience(at times). I have never heard a score that is so good but then suddenly so annoying, when the action comes around I dislike it, but when the others scenes that have John Williams score in come, they are good, it is quite strange. I must also add here in terms of technical things, the locations and sets are stunning, well designed but not too corny either, a big well done to the team on that one and also to the cinematography from Douglas Slocombe who's skill this movie owes a lot to as well.Listen this film may be flawless and I might be missing something, or maybe my review just seems a little too mean. The movie is very entertaining don't get me wrong and I would re-watch this many times but I just feel I am among the minority who don't think this is that that great, even though I think it is great even.

Basically what I'm trying to say is, don't watch this like your still whatever age you were when it first came out, I mean for newer fans they have many adventure film for this to compare to, and I find that it is Spielberg, Lucas and Phil Kaufman's(who helped with the whole story and script) job to make this one of the best even in the future.

Also the research that people (army mostly) from outside try to do is one of my favorite parts. It might be that the novel reveals more but I haven't had the courage to go through that yet.

First, when you are watching any reputed historical tale and one side is the repository of light and goodness, e.g. Braveheart, and the other Satanic evil it is pure crap. Now, we see the depredations of the Union Army with the burning of Atlanta, the stragglers raping (implied) and ransacking the manors. Where, may I ask, are the ravagers of the Southern variety? Only the North, ransacked and raped? Please, how puerile. Now, when a conservative thinks the depiction of the slaves was insultingly idealized you have real problems. Where is all the slave beating? Yes, Scarlet yells at her plenty but notice how Walt Disney the depiction of slavery is; of course, the rampant miscegenation of slave owners raping or using their black women slaves as sexual chattel is not even mentioned. This is the Civil War seen through Margret Mitchell's eyes and a parallax view it truly is. Can we guess where her sympathies were with The North? I don't think so.The movie is boring like you cannot imagine. If you are having people over, break it into two nights or you will regret it. I put an entire room full of people into comas around hour three. Mitchell herself has written that Leslie Howard was a disaster as Ashley Wilkes. Please, could he be more effeminate? Women of Leigh's and DeHavilland's pedigree would not be fighting over a painfully, devoid of muscles, mama's boy. This is the other problem, the romance does not work. It has no verisimilitude, one of the three points of the triangle, frankly, looks like he would be more interested in Clark Gable than in either of the women. Have no illusions, this is a romance with a patina of idealized history as a colorful backdrop. If you are going in expecting a history lesson, you are going to be sorely disappointed. The film moves well until the war breaks out, then it slows down to fingernail growth speed. The acting is good, the dialog has some clever and witty banter.

The Shawshank Redemption is just an extraordinarily inspirational movie. It just isn't a normal prison break story; a very deep implicit definition is buried in every scene of it. The main theme is the presence and the belief in hope by the main character of the story, Andy Dufresne. Repeatedly saying hope is a good thing, Andy finally gets what he always wanted an escape and a new start in the Pacific, something that was always described as impossible by the other prisoners. I guess that the element that triggered the viewers' attention the most was the optimism and mysterious character of Andy Dufresne. Watching the movie, we weren't really able to read what was going on his mind even though we had implicit clues of the clever and beautiful things he kept to himself. The choice of Tim Robbins as the main persona was well thought by Frank Darabont as he doesn't show a lot of emotions on his face. The bond that connected the inmates, especially Red and Andy was very strong, leading to sacrifices and promises. The friendship between the two men lasts beyond the walls of Shawshank and finds itself reincarnated in Zihuatanejo, the country with no memory. Another thing that strikes the spectators is the enjoyment and the love of the small things in life. This concept was seen in the opera music scene, where the beauty of the music and the voices of the Italian ladies went past the skins and through the souls of the prisoners. The excitement felt by all these men was the only pleasing element that wasn't taken from them in this dangerous place. The most important piece of The Shawshank Redemption was the message that inspired all the movie lovers every man has value and importance in the world. This message personally helped me slide away from my negative attitude and helped me enjoy every moment of life. For this incredible adaptation of Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King, I would like to gratefully thank Frank Darabont sharing his work of art to the world.

This is absolute junk that should be put in a toaster so it can look as fried as the brains viewing it. Score 0 \/ 10 ","genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure"},{"date":"5 August 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Calling Akira a great movie would be and understatement. It is a technical marvel that still holds up even after nearly 30 years of a half baked medium. Animation has gone downhill in some aspects. Gone are the techniques of traditional animation, now replaced by cheap and unimpressive flash animation. Kids shows are now a pointless mush mash of random dance parties, butt shaking and gross out humor (Nickelodeon in a nutshell). It's all backwash and pig vomit...and kids are eating it up...for the most part. You see, kids aren't that stupid as we initially thought. Their comes a time in their age where they realize that animation before the New Millennium was actually pretty amazing. I myself came to that age and stumbled across Akira. Brief synopsis Akira follows two members of a biker gang Tetsuo and Kaneda. Both have distinctive personalities. Kaneda is the cocky and enthusiastic gang leader, while Tetsuo is a bit of an underdog that is trying to prove his worth to his fellow bikers. When Tetsuo is caught in a serious accident, he is sent to a government hospital without his friends knowledge. Without spoiling much lets just say that Tetsuo gains immense psychic power and wreaks havoc on Neo Tokyo. Please be sure to watch this marvel of a movie. I give it a perfect score.

I think it was just an excuse to watch it over and over again and memorise it! A dream cast of the late great Robin Williams who is perfect as a grown up Peter Pan, the brilliant Dustin Hoffman is Hook, Julia Roberts is gorgeous as Tinkerbell the fairy and another late actor Bob Hoskins plays Hook's mischievous sidekick Smee. Directed by Steven Spielberg with John Williams scoring the music...it's all perfect! Maybe if I were to nitpick, it's a bit long winded at over two hours long and I've never quite accepted how Hook is destroyed - eaten by a dead, stuffed giant crocodile, but when we're dealing with flying humans, fairies and pirates I guess there are films where you've just got to switch off and go with it. I'm sure most people reading this have already seen 'Hook' so I won't bore you with my scene by scene account on what happens. If you've not seen it, Peter pan is now an adult (Robin Williams) forced to return to Neverland after Captain Hook kidnaps Hook's kids, and remember who he is and learn to fight the evil one handed Captain all over again. The slanging match at the Lost Boys' dinner table is a classic scene, and look out for a cameo from Phil Collins as the Police Inspector after the kids have been kidnapped!

It's a great debut film by Richard Kelly.Donnie Darko, a high school student, is visited by a large bunny named Frank that tells him the world is going to end in 28 days. Frank then urges him to perform different dangerous tasks in the days leading up to the calamity.This movie is made great due to its elaborate plot which was clearly well-thought out by the director. I didn't have much trouble understanding the film throughout its entirety but the ending did confuse me. But after re-watching it and looking up a few theories, I was able to get it and I was astonished by how much effort went into it. It is truly well-done.Jake Gyllenhaal clearly steals the show giving a mesmerizing performance. He is able to convey several emotions and draw us in very well. The fact that Donnie Darko's character is brutally honest, troubled, and confused makes him an easy character to sympathize with. All the other actors did a great job too but Gyllenhaal did the best job.One last thing I want to talk about is that usually when people talk about great mind-bending movies, Christopher Nolan is usually brought up the most but I feel that people need to focus on other movies too. Examples of other great movies with elaborate plot include this film, The Usual Suspects, Fight Club, Being John Malkovich, The Tree of Life, Primer, Mulholland Drive, Twelve Monkeys, 2001 A Space Odyssey, and Shutter Island. If you're a fan of Nolan then you should check these movies out too. I think Nolan is a great director but I don't like how most people ignore other movies with elaborate plots. Some of these are really famous like Fight Club but the audience usually tends to say that Nolan does the best job with movies of this genre. If you enjoy Nolan then you should check these out too. If you don't like them or still prefer Nolan's movies though then that's fine. I'm just giving these as suggestions.So in conclusion, I think that this movie is amazing. Once you know its plot, it will keep you in awe. I think that this is an outstanding movie which you should see.
