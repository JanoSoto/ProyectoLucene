I, like many others, thought it was great, and loved Streisand and Redford and the theme song. I recently saw TWWW again, nearly 40 years later, and my opinion has changed dramatically. I cannot deny that Redford and Streisand definitely seem to have some kind of chemistry. And, as I felt the first time, Barbra represented every ugly duckling, gay or straight, who somehow manages to capture the prize. Via Barbra's performance, we can easily imagine what it must have been like to lie down with a prince. This, I think, may be one reason why the film had a certain level of success. Barbra also had moments where she spoke the truth with passion and intensity. I think people related to this outspokenness, this gutsiness, this willingness to take chances and not apologize for one's opinions. Barbra was also the outsider -- she was the smart Jewish girl who knew she had to work harder, study more, and fight for what she wanted, because nothing would come to her easily. It is for these reasons why I think the movie resonated. But the reality is The movie is not about anything, not really. What, exactly, is the plot? They meet in school, they meet years later, they fall in love, they get married, he has an affair, they divorce, they meet again... okay, so what? Barbra, who does have tons of talent, but in this film looked like she was performing her graduate project for Acting 101, spends a lot of time arguing and getting upset about things. But whatever those things are seem to be only tangentially connected\/related to the rest of the story (if you can call it that). Bob, yes, stunning to look at, coasts through the film with little to do or say. He didn't want to do the film, and I can see why. Yeah, he looks great, but what is the emotional arc of his character? A lot was cut from this film and as a result, it seems disjointed. There is an inordinate amount of time spent on Bob's career as a screenwriter in Hollywood while a pregnant Barbra tends to their little beach house. And yet everyone seems miserable and unhappy. Voices were raised, but nothing really happens. Near the end when Barbra has apparently given birth to their child (after it's clear that their relationship is over), Bob shows up at the hospital. Barbra is perfectly coiffed and made-up as if she's just come back from a spa. He stands there, emotionless, ready to abandon her and their newborn child. We're supposed to like him? I couldn't stand him. In fact, James Wood, who we meet early on in the film, who seems to be Barbra's quasi-boyfriend in college and who seems to support everything she was trying to do, is clearly a better man for her--but he wasn't as handsome. Life is cruel, isn't it? Finally, the theme song Yes, it is a beautiful song for what it is and Barbra sings it beautifully. Who knew that it would become an iconic song and help define her career? She didn't even want to sing the song--she felt it was too simple. She had to be talked into it. So, finally, in the end, what are we left with? A unique opportunity to see Barbra and Bob dressing in period costumes, lots of bad, bad lighting, a plot-less rambling story that does not stay any one place long enough for us to care about much of anything, lots of intense arguing and challenging others from Barbra, and lots of stoic looks from Bob. And yet, it was a big hit. Like I said at the beginning, it was Barbra's ugly duckling status and landing the prince that I think resonated with a large part of the audience.

In fact I'd normally say I don't like 'em. But although the characters in this film do burst out into spontaneously synchronised and practised song somehow the songs they sing are short enough to be less than a mild irritation and pertinent enough to keep the story moving.I'm a straight guy but must admit to being a sucker for women with their feet firmly on the ground and that's why I find Doris Day's portrayal of the character so intriguing. Some might say that this is an ugly duckling film but in this case and for me the before look is much more interesting than the after one. She prances around in scruffy attire, walks like a man and often sits or poses with her legs wide open but however much she plays the tomboy and tries to hide her femininity under a bushel she fails. Why? Because she just is a very beautiful woman; heck you could cover her in mud (and this actually happens at one point in the film) and she wouldn't lose her femininity.I've seen lots of cabaret in Berlin - Victor, Victoria type stuff and this film is reminiscent of that although not quite so refined but all the same it's a woman dressed as a man and looking good for it! The film verges on homo-eroticism at times although it never features as a central theme. There is about 10 minute's worth of pure homo-eroticism however that takes place in a log cabin that would do Barbie proud but the main themes focus on a woman who doesn't know how to be one and learns as well as people who are oblivious to the fact that they are in love perhaps because they are such good friends; then Cupid strikes suddenly. As I say, I'm a straight guy but although a part of me appreciated the ugly duckling changing her spots another part of me ended up wishing that she'd stayed the way she was.The sets are wonderful as are the lush costumes.This is not a film to watch on a small monitor.

In fact I'd normally say I don't like 'em. But although the characters in this film do burst out into spontaneously synchronised and practised song somehow the songs they sing are short enough to be less than a mild irritation and pertinent enough to keep the story moving.I'm a straight guy but must admit to being a sucker for women with their feet firmly on the ground and that's why I find Doris Day's portrayal of the character so intriguing. Some might say that this is an ugly duckling film but in this case and for me the before look is much more interesting than the after one. She prances around in scruffy attire, walks like a man and often sits or poses with her legs wide open but however much she plays the tomboy and tries to hide her femininity under a bushel she fails. Why? Because she just is a very beautiful woman; heck you could cover her in mud (and this actually happens at one point in the film) and she wouldn't lose her femininity.I've seen lots of cabaret in Berlin - Victor, Victoria type stuff and this film is reminiscent of that although not quite so refined but all the same it's a woman dressed as a man and looking good for it! The film verges on homo-eroticism at times although it never features as a central theme.

While I was watching it I had strange feeling like this film was made recently, not long ago. When you watch it, if you don't know anything about when it was made you would think it was filmed in 1990s or maybe in 2000s and you would be surprised to learn that it was made back in 1982. And still today after 30 years it looks fresh and relevant. It testifies about one thing  this movie was much ahead of a time when it was made, I would say without exaggerating at least some 10-15 years ahead of its time. Intelligently packed, it tells a story of our own human alienation from each other through fictional dystopian society of the future where we produce replicates to do our dirty work and at the same time be as much as we are to make it extremely hard to spot the difference in order to avoid discomfort of humans still self-deceived of being superior. The catch is they are designed to last only for four years and they die as programmed, so they will be denied an opportunity of self-knowledge.And that self-knowledge could lead to rebellion against their own designers which is the deepest human fear - becoming evolutionary obsolete and being replaced with a new specie much more advanced. Therefore, movie raises many philosophical and ethical questions which will not be assessed on this place for it would take a whole new review to write. The point hidden in the story about relations between humans and AIs (Artificial Intelligence beings) is in our own relationships between each other. Located in future, story of the movie is actually an allegory of our presence, but still this movie was prophetic and farsighted. Many things seen in the movie (like artificially designed and printed objects and animals) are becoming reality of 21st century with new nanotechnologies and 3D printing technique's appearing that could revolutionize our way of life and who knows what else future brings. And modern and future human isolation and alienation can be seen throughout whole movie - one example are toys to serve as friends for J.F.Sebastian because he does n't have real ones. When four self-knowing replicates escape from space and return to Earth they become immediate danger. And blade runner (Harrison Ford)is dispatched to hunt and kill them all which he successfully does for three of them - Leon, Zhora and Pris because they are impulsive and reckless. But their leader Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer)is something completely else. Intellectually and physically superior he predicts every move his opponents will make because they made him to. There is brutal symbolics when he kills his designer Dr.Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel). Like a grim message of possible human future, or an irony that our own superior creations could come to collect our debts we made on this planet. Punish us for our countless sins towards ourselves and everyone and everything else. Philosopher and killer, Batty is personification of best and worst in us, he is representative of mankind and with his own tragedy he is representing tragedy of us. He is collective human conscience. He could have easily killed Deckard (Harrison Ford), but he did n't because there was no point in doing so. He just showed him what it feels to be hunted and in fear, because in his own words life in fear is life of a slave. And he was tired of it. Deckard was not a real enemy, just a tool in hands of those who considered him disposable just like the replicates. Deckard understood it from last confession made by Batty and in the end of the movie he takes with him his love Rachael (also replicate) to spend with her the little time left. Maybe Deckard too is a replicate which we are left to guess and speculate on that irony. Every next generation washes up achievements and mistakes, hopes and horrors, visions and memories of previous ones with their own maybe saving them only in collective remembrance of all of us.

I am not familiar with Vladimir Nabokov's novel, but the movie is splendid. I consider this a highlight of film noir cinema. The movie centers the obsession of a middle-aged man upon a 14 year teenage girl. The acting is superb, especially by James Mason as Humbert Humbert who is likely to be stuck in midlife crisis. As he was looking for a room to let he just got acquainted with his lolita by name Dolores Haze. She is the gorgeous daughter of Charlotte Haze, a bumptious, status-seeking, 40-something householder (the slang refers to a cougar) who was about to rent a free room in her house. Charlotte asked her new tenant to look after her young daughter with whom she had a strained relationship. Time went on and Humbert became more and more obsessed with Lolita but also had to resist the sexual proposals of his landlady (&#x85;) I do not intend to spoiler too much here. The story telling is marvelous. Humbert's infatuation with the girl reached his climax as Lolita confessed her love to him. He increasingly made severe attempts to control Lolita's daily life due to his jealousy and he began to lose self-control and stability. If you are watching the movie you will fast realize that the catastrophe must have soon befallen. Lolita was playing with Humbertand Humbert couldn't bear up the complicated love story. I do not purpose to tell you more than necessary, and hope to awake your interest. Watch this movie &#x96; I highly recommend it! One of the best i have ever seen.

For some, it was a fairly accurate depiction of the emotional drain first year law school can bring about. We didn't see these folks again after the Christmas break. For most, however, it was a bit 'over-the-top' fun - strategically useful to impress family and friends who always seemed to be oddly curious about the academic rigors involved in becoming a lawyer. Our law school sponsored a frosh-night just before the first week of classes and, after the movie was released it was played as the highlight of the evening. For those of us in second and third-years who were also invited, it was great fun to observe the incoming, first-year students squirm and grimace as if it were they who were called-upon to recite the facts and finding in Carlill & Carbolic Smoke Ball. Housman's performance, while undoubtedly brilliant and, indeed, a major dramatic focal-point of the film, would have been rather softened in reality. The students in my class (and no doubt the ones both before and after) were superbly aware of their own social rights and responsibilities and they certainly were no wall-flowers by any stretch. They would have very quickly and resoundingly stood-up to that sort of intimidation and it wouldn't have happened again. And yet, now, some 40 years later, having just seen the movie again, I must say, upon reflection, it really does capture the essence of the law school experience. It is a jealous mistress; romantic relationships, sports, hobbies, casual fun - all of it becomes secondary to the almost overwhelming curricular demands. As is suggested in the film, it is not just a question of learning material, memorizing statutes and jurisprudence; it is more than that. It is a matter of changing the way one sees reality. To this day, even though I am a retired lawyer, I look at a vehicular accident and I think 'tortious liability'. I hear an ambulance and I think 'wills and estates'. I watch Dads alone and fumbling uncomfortably with their kids in MacDonald's on Saturday morning and I remember the 'custody and access' battles in which my clients were engaged.

They all work in a specific way Specific camera angles, specific music for each situation in the film, and specific stories to each scene. Every soul disturbing and spine chilling scene in this has its own story which puts me on edge to no end. From the unusual use of wide angle lenses, to the awkward camera angles, combined with the eerie music to set the mood makes for one great thrill ride.Based on the novel by Anthony Burgess, Kubrick decided to bring the infamous Alex character to life in this evil version of Anthony's classic, bringing the characters, tone, and language to his own sick and twisted world.Our main character named Alex, (Malcolm McDowell) and his three droogs all set out to spread chaos and mayhem around the world, breaking and entering, raping, beating, anything they can think of to make the world a worse place to live. Alex gets betrayed by his droogs and is sentenced 14 to life. He gets off the hook by participating in a new scientific experiment yet to be perfected, (change the cold blooded and deranged mind of a criminal into a peace loving citizen).Kubrick excellently displays Anthony's attempt on the language barrier between Alex and the viewer. The language, the setting, the camera angles, and every other piece of scenery perfectly places us into this characters world. The scenes of violence in Alex's mind puts us in his shoes and shows us how messed up he is. We see unexplained images that confuse us, but also intrigue us, as we transport ourselves into his mind. Kubrick does not show mercy with the nudity. Every corner there is a pair of boobs in your face. This is not his simple intention to arouse the audience or to be explicit, but simply to show us that Alex lives in a world without rules, regret, or discipline, and how it immediately all changes when he gets caught and participates in the experiment, and how it affects his world later.Kubrick truly is the only one who could have pulled off Anthony's vision. His absolute monstrous style of film making combined with the sick and twisted mind of Anthony Burgess easily makes this one of the darkest films of all time. I enjoyed every second of this classic story. The dark tone, the beautiful dialog and narration, and the excellent story telling makes this an easily enjoyed masterpiece.

They all work in a specific way Specific camera angles, specific music for each situation in the film, and specific stories to each scene. Every soul disturbing and spine chilling scene in this has its own story which puts me on edge to no end. From the unusual use of wide angle lenses, to the awkward camera angles, combined with the eerie music to set the mood makes for one great thrill ride.Based on the novel by Anthony Burgess, Kubrick decided to bring the infamous Alex character to life in this evil version of Anthony's classic, bringing the characters, tone, and language to his own sick and twisted world.Our main character named Alex, (Malcolm McDowell) and his three droogs all set out to spread chaos and mayhem around the world, breaking and entering, raping, beating, anything they can think of to make the world a worse place to live. Alex gets betrayed by his droogs and is sentenced 14 to life. He gets off the hook by participating in a new scientific experiment yet to be perfected, (change the cold blooded and deranged mind of a criminal into a peace loving citizen).Kubrick excellently displays Anthony's attempt on the language barrier between Alex and the viewer. The language, the setting, the camera angles, and every other piece of scenery perfectly places us into this characters world.

Saying that, I also believe that's the reason why I enjoyed it so much. Granted this is definitely the worst of the three Friday films with some good reason. Some of the jokes seemed kind of forced and in some cases the film seemed to be overacted (You'll see what I mean when you meet the neighbors). Despite that, Ice Cube wrote a solid screenplay that shows that even in the suburbs, things can get crazy. Mike Epps' crazy ex was excellent along with the treatment that she gives to him over the course of the day. That ugly dog was hilarious particularly in the second half of the movie. Not to mention the weed jokes (sorry to those who don't like 'em, I'm a sucker for 'em, personal experience I guess haha but I digress). Plus when you see a fine lady in the film you can't help but to give it a couple extra points. Advice before seeing this, watch the first one and admit that It'll never be topped and you'll enjoy this movie.
