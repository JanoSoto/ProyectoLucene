[{"date":"13 May 2009","score":"","review":" Imagine you wake up one morning and start your routine, only to remember it is your last day to do this routine. You head to the shower as you have for every work day in the last 20 years. As you walk into the bathroom you begin to relive your career. The first day on the job and how excited you were. When you feel the water hit you, it hits you, the first time you met your better half. As you dry off and stand in front of the mirror you remember the first time you got the big promotion and how you shared it with your then girlfriend. You finish dressing and as you walk out the door to the car, you think of the first time you met your boss, the owner of the company, and how he took a liking to you right away. Then the car door slams and you turn the key, still unaware of your surrounding as you relive moments, even seconds, and how they changed your life. You turn onto the expressway for what you have come to know has the hour and half drive to work. It has just begun but you have done it so many times it come to you as second nature. You have learned to turn the blare of the horns off, the sounds of your surrounding just disappear, and you can concentrate on the task at hand. For 20 years now you have done this. Day in and day out it has been your routine. You begin to think back to the first time you stepped into your new office, the one on the top floor, the one with the window, you smile. Then you realize that although this your last day, it is also the biggest day of your career. you have a chance to close a deal that only a few in the history of your company have done, heck in the history of the whole business have ever done. Your focus returns and you go back into auto pilot, as you have done a thousand times. We can all imagine this situation, maybe not for a 20 year career, but for something. The last day you spent at home before heading off to college, knowing you would never again live in the house where your mom made all those great pancakes. Never again have your dad teach you to ride a bike or throw a ball. Maybe it was prom or graduation. Knowing that the twelve years you had spent is now ending and you are not a kid anymore. Life and new choices await you right outside that door. We have all been there, all had that moment to IMAGINE. It is the story of professional baseball player, Billy Chapel (Played by Kevin Costner), and the history of his life and career in the span of one nine inning perfect game. We watch as he pitches the game of his life after a 20 year career, all the while reliving his greatest hits so to speak. He relives his first love, baseball, his real love, Jane Aubrey (Played by Kelly Preston). He relives the injury that almost cost him his career. All this takes place on his last day of work. While he is pitching the only perfect game in his long and illustrious career he lives all of it. This is what makes him realize that in the end it was only a job and the relationships he has built and the choices he has made are what made him, not just the Love of the Game This movie touches the soul and also allows us to get into the minds of the fans that love the game. As we watch him relive his life, it reaches into our hearts and pulls. As we watch him pitch against the New York Yankees, it brings out the fan in all of us and we watch even the harsh Yankee faithful fall for this guy who is pitching a perfect game against their team. If there was ever a sports movie that could take us everywhere we wanted to go and to the places we seldom admit we need to go, this is it. So the next time your team is rained out and the reruns season is in mid run. Go to the video store, or turn on the laptop and download it. I enjoy it every time I get a chance to see it. I always walk away feeling better about my choices and knowing that life is the same way. We have to imagine and we have to live it for the love of the game.

","genre":"Drama, Romance, Sport"},{"date":"13 May 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" In 1974, if anyone had been asked their predictions of what upcoming release would change the course of the industry, it is impossible to imagine there being a less likely candidate than Jaws. A pulpy novel adapted by a 28 year old near unknown director yielding one of the most infamously disastrous film shoots in the history of the medium (a duration of a projected 55 days exploding into 159, with a cantankerous cast, a mutinous crew and a barely functioning shark prop) - all things considered, the fact that the film was completed is a feat in itself. And yet, paradoxically for a film centering around a series of deaths, Jaws instead yielded a succession of figurative rebirths, being credited with singlehandedly pioneering the summer blockbuster and ancillary markets, terrifying and thrilling audiences worldwide and turning its amateur director into one of the most recognizable figures in the film industry - a certain Steven Spielberg. The combination of factors clicked, Jaws wormed its way into the collective unconscious with uncanny speed, and no viewer would ever look at deep water entirely devoid of fear again.The film is a true rarity - a 'monster' film which spends most of the film avoiding showing its iconic antagonist, a horror thriller in which the characters emerge as the most memorable, and a film with the simplest of premises which has yielded countless theories on the meaning of the shark (alternatively declared as emblematic of womanhood attacking the film's smörgåsbord of masculinity, cold war nuclear destruction on a small American town, or the entire film as an extensive critique of American capitalism - particularly ironic for such an outrageously financially successful film). Yet Jaws also harbours a real pulsating life beyond being a mere collection of now iconic moments and lines. Scenes such as Brody's trading silly faces with his son at the dinner table and the three protagonists' drunken comparison of scars infuse the film with a genuine heart and emotional attachment, making the masterfully concealed yet still shoddy special effects all the more easy to swallow and the film all the more engrossing. As effective a directorial calling card as any, the film serves to showcase all the attributes which would serve to make Spielberg a cinematic legend addressing familiar viewer expectations with a paradoxically refreshing immediacy, constructed yet honest emotion, sentiment trimmed of excess sap and credible optimism juxtaposed with real terror. A simple tale of men versus shark is evolved into a larger than life cinematic parable, and, crucially, remains enormously entertaining in spite of its countless other plaudits. Yet what makes Spielberg's film the most intriguing is its ability to accomplish so much with so little. From the skeletal plot to John Williams' timeless yet almost entirely two note musical score to Bill Butler's legendary shark point-of-view cinematography to the script's impressive use of few lines to suggest a wealth of characterisation, the film thrives on minimalism. Spielberg distills conventional story complexity and nuance into emotional chords (fear of water, the unknown, etc.) as primal as the film's antagonist. And antagonist the shark unquestionably is, overblown far past notions of realistic shark size and behaviour into the definitive foe, beyond conventional notions of evil into an unflinching, incessant force of nature, and all the more terrifying because of it. And it is the shark's unpredictable tearing through the picture which chaotically deviates from its minimalism, punctuating its crisp efficiency with bursts of brutal excesses. While Spielberg amps the tension of the pending shark attacks up to near unbearable levels, their sheer ferocity and the camera's tenacious refusal to shy away from the gruesome spectacle still manages to make them shocking and horrifying despite the anticipation. However, Spielberg is not afraid to take his time - after a while knuckled opening fright, the film slows down, allowing copious time for audiences to sit with and take to the down to earth honesty of the characters while slowly but surely moving its plot along, making the bursts of shark activity all the more surprising through having lured the audience into a false sense of security. And while such thrill driven films would normally pale in a contemporary context (and it is likely the film could prove too slow and comparatively bloodless to equally enthrall more gore-saturated modern viewers), Jaws defies such concerns through its sublimely creeping pacing and masterful technical work, making the film as superb an emotional assault currently as in 1975. Roy Scheider's gruff charisma proves the perfect emotional heart for the film, making his aquaphobic Chief Brody not only innately likable but entirely credible, an unshowy yet impeccably realized triumph of a lead. Richard Dreyfus is also wonderfully memorable, his devilish sarcasm making marine biologist Matt Hooper eons away from the stereotypical ranting scientist. Robert Shaw is simply mesmerising as grizzled shark hunter Quint, toeing the perfect balance between being raucously likable and dangerously deranged, with his chilling Indianapolis monologue searing into the memory. Lorraine Gary is also an entirely human creation as Brody's wife, with each action suggesting years of familiarity and chemistry. And Murray Hamilton maintains a gleefully infuriating paradox of being an insidiously hateful character, yet too slickly charismatic and nearly sympathetic to outright dislike as Amity Island's struggling mayor, famously refusing to close the beaches despite the danger due to the income from busy season. As unlikely as it may have been, Jaws proves a truly unforgettable triumph of a motion picture, proving that narrative simplicity and being geared to be enjoyable need not be mutually exclusive from quality film-making. Even years from its initial release the film remains uniformly superb enough to justify the exceptional burst of merchandising and publicity, proving one of those few films as unlikely to be fully shaken from the viewer's head as the collective unconscious. Never again will it be entirely safe to go back in the water. -10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 May 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" In 1974, if anyone had been asked their predictions of what upcoming release would change the course of the industry, it is impossible to imagine there being a less likely candidate than Jaws.
