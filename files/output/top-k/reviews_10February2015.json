Sadly, he was out of the limelight as quickly as he entered it although you can still see him act here and there in his 60s today. Not so Ruth Gordon. She was already an Academy award winner and one of the most respected actresses of her generation at that point. Director Hal Ashby also had an Oscar already at this point, for his editing work in a previous film. Picket Faences lovers will enjoy Tim Skerritt in his small appearance here. This one runs for 90 minutes and features several Cat Stevens songs, a very beautiful one at the start already.Harold plays suicide pranks for most of the film. His mother is well aware of his tendencies, so she doesn't even panic anymore. Not so the girls she brings to meet her son. Harold, however, only is interested in Maude, an old lady he builds a non-sexual relationship with which becomes stronger and stronger as the film progresses. Gordon gives a very fine performance here. If you want to see more from her, I recommend the Columbo episode she starred in. ItÄs tough to say if this is really more of a comedy or drama. Maybe that is also why the film missed out on a comedy Golden Globe nomination despite its two leads getting in. There are some funny scenes, for example when Harold's mom takes the test with him, or I should probably say for him. The suicide attempts I don't know if they are funny. They got a bit repetitive though.The emotional dramatic highlight for me was when he talks to Maude about his childhood and the fire. A truly sad scene. It had even more impact to me as the actual ending. I did not really like it that much. Maude seemed like she was enjoying every minute of life and then she randomly goes in the last 5 minutes of the movie. Sure, you could argue she is the type who decides when it is time to go and not let anybody else make that decision, not even God, but it just didn't feel right to me anyway. What I liked better was the one camera shot on her Nazi tattoo. It would have not been so effective on its own, but with her talk about kings earlier on, it made perfectly sense. I also liked the very last scene with how we see him standing up there and the car gone. It seems like the fact that he got out in time shows that his desire for suicide is pretty much gone, so no more attempts in the future perhaps. He perceives death as loss now with Maude gone and not as something to aim for anymore.All in all, it is a good movie and I recommend it. It's not one of my absolute favorites, but it's pretty solid. It's not a waste of time at all, but it's difficult to point out exactly as I personally felt something was missing for greatness or a higher rating, but go decide for yourself and watch it.

Not only does it deliver fully in terms of comedy and drama, but it also managed to win the five big categories at the Oscars back in 1976. Jack Nicholson gives the maybe finest performance from his career and that says a lot. Louise Fletcher's Nurse Ratched regularly makes all-time villain lists and this film is considered one of the greatest examples of how the movie is better than the book it is based on, namely Ken Kesey's novel. So congrats to the writing team Goldman\/Hauben, of which the latter never wrote another screenplay than this one here. And to director Milos Forman who, now in his early 80s, gave us many more great films during his 50-year-long career.If you take a closer look, you will see that this movie starts the way it ends. With a camera shot outside the institution. At the beginning a car approaches, possibly the one bringing McMurphy and at the end we see Chief leaving to freedom. Everything in-between (except the boat trip) takes place behind the walls\/fences of the institution. We get to see several sessions with sadist Ratched in control, which usually end up way worse for all the inmates than they started. As I mentioned earlier, there's moments when you can never be sure which direction this film is gonna take in the end, comedy or drama. That is also why the final developments are so shocking for everybody. Is it an uplifting ending? Or a depressing? I'm not sure. You have to decide for yourself. The boat trip was certainly the highlight in terms of lightness. Everybody had such a great time with the evil nurse not present. I liked how McMurphy acted as if catching the fish was something so big, such a huge event to boost the inmates' confidence.Apart from that, it is also interesting to see how the employees of the institution act. Some are sadist and like to humiliate as well, some almost treat them equally at times, like during that big party scene. Obviously, the scene when Billy is caught with the woman by Nurse Ratched is very significant too. You could argue how Ratched's own sexual frustration may play a role in the way she ruthlessly reacted and pushed her unstable patient into suicide. She is maybe an even more interesting character than McMurphy. But is she lead or supporting? I'm not sure about that with McMurphy being so much in the center of the movie. But maybe that is just due to Nicholson's great screen presence. Anyway, it's fascinating to see how Ratched hides her mean behavior behind alleged seriousness She allows the poll, but still decides the outcome. She tells that the more insane members count as much as everybody else as they are part of the institution as well etc.And there is a water application (not sure of the exact name) that plays a major part in this movie too, as this is basically the means to freedom, at first only seemingly with McMurphy, but in the end actually with the Chief, also a very interesting character. however, the early significance of this application is also shown as his little demonstration about how McMurphy at least tried makes everybody brave enough to vote for seeing the baseball game in the face of Ratched's evil eye.Finally you could argue Did Chief do the right thing in the end? Or, what if McMurphy had been the doctor and Ratched was one of the patients (as it should be?). Would it be better for all the other inmates as they seem to get along with him well. Is it even possible with McMurphy's anti-authority lifestyle and approach. Anyway, if you see that this film was made in the 1970s you could certainly applaud it for its liberal attitude towards sex, nudity, alcohol, authorities and possibly even euthanasia towards the end. Be warned that this movie has two very intense scenes first the medical procedure taken on McMurphy after the first brawl and finally the pillow scene. Stay away if you maybe can't handle these.

It runs for slightly over 100 minutes. The director also appears himself in the film again just like he usually does. I personally believe, however, that Signs is still his best work to this day. I have to say I enjoyed the first half of The Sixth Sense more than the second. It feels more intimate with basically the whole first half (after the shooting) being communications between Willis' and Osment's characters. If you know the final twist, it does not hurt the film at all. It even makes the interaction between Willis' character and his ex-wife more interesting the Zoloft, her not speaking except Happy anniversary!... I've seen this film two or three times already and I always find something new and intriguing about it. The second half with the play and the interactions between the boy and other dead people did not do so much for me.The film scored six Academy Award nominations that year. The only one I'm a bit baffled with is Toni Collette, who I did not find that memorable. And Osment is obviously lead and not supporting. Back in 1999, over 15 years ago, this was the most successful film of the year at the box office, right behind the newest Star Wars film. I felt the film was at its weakest when it tried to go too much for horror instead of mystery thriller. Most of the dialogs were very well written, so no need to include any of the cheap thrills instead.Funnily enough, I watched the Witherspoon\/Ruffalo comedy Just like Heaven before The Sixth Sense and in a way they are both about seeing dead (or almost dead) people. Of course, this one here is much more serious in tone. I recommend it and believe you should have seen it at least once, even if it certainly has more rewatch value than most people will admit, even if you know the final development of Willis' character. (I myself have to say Ik did not see it coming the first time I watched this movie.) Oh and if you liked Osment's work here, make sure to check out some of his other films. He did not have a career as great as this suggested he could, at least not yet, but he is a talented young actor, just like his sister Emily.

Back in 1999, over 15 years ago, this was the most successful film of the year at the box office, right behind the newest Star Wars film. I felt the film was at its weakest when it tried to go too much for horror instead of mystery thriller. Most of the dialogs were very well written, so no need to include any of the cheap thrills instead.Funnily enough, I watched the Witherspoon\/Ruffalo comedy Just like Heaven before The Sixth Sense and in a way they are both about seeing dead (or almost dead) people. Of course, this one here is much more serious in tone. I recommend it and believe you should have seen it at least once, even if it certainly has more rewatch value than most people will admit, even if you know the final development of Willis' character. (I myself have to say Ik did not see it coming the first time I watched this movie.) Oh and if you liked Osment's work here, make sure to check out some of his other films.

It runs for slightly over 100 minutes. The director also appears himself in the film again just like he usually does. I personally believe, however, that Signs is still his best work to this day. I have to say I enjoyed the first half of The Sixth Sense more than the second. It feels more intimate with basically the whole first half (after the shooting) being communications between Willis' and Osment's characters. If you know the final twist, it does not hurt the film at all. It even makes the interaction between Willis' character and his ex-wife more interesting the Zoloft, her not speaking except Happy anniversary!...

This made a great deal of sense to me since I did not see much production value in it - this was noticeable even with it being an older film. To me Detour seems like a very rushed attempt at trying to make a noir film that works - not necessarily a great noir film, but one that fits the tenants of the genre. We start with Al Roberts as the wanderer who chooses not to be sociable; there is something troubling him, and he conveys this through, what seems to me to be, over-acting. We get a shift in chronology (a tenant of film noir which I love) and flash back to when he was a pianist and happy with a girlfriend, and this is where his journey begins. He needs to travel west to be with his beloved, but he needs to hitchhike in order to do so. Roberts meets a man named Haskell and the titular detour to where Roberts needs to go occurs on this journey. He inconveniently ends up in a situation where Haskell dies from what seems to be an accidental hit on his head as he falls out of the car. Then, because plot, Roberts happens to unknowingly stumble across Haskell's wife at a gas station, and he allows her to ride with him. As a complicated love triangle is almost formed, Haskell's wife blackmails Roberts into helping her squeeze money out of Haskell's car and inheritance by threatening to bring her husband's murder to the police. Once again, because plot, Roberts accidentally (yes it was an accident with a phone line) strangles Vera and kills her. He becomes the typical unreliable noir narrator at this point since this could have likely gone another way. All of this was rushed in just over the span of an hour. It is a noir film that has a cohesive plot, but evoked little interest from me. The ending voice-over about his acceptance of getting picked up one day over the image of him actually getting picked up by authorities was intriguing, but not the sort of ending which would rank this film among the likes of Sunset Boulevard or Double Indemnity.

Much as I adore the intense character study of The Social Network, the dark mind-games of Gone Girl and the rich storytelling in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, I feel that Se7en is Fincher showing off everything he does best. It's a brooding, jet black thriller which makes you look inwardly and consider so many aspects of human nature.In the film, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play homicide detectives &#x96; one recently transferred to a large city, the other getting ready for retirement. On paper, their relationship is a detective cliché, but Pitt and Freeman's chemistry ensures that it transcends this. The pair start to discover a string of horrific murders, each one linked to one of the seven deadly sins, and attempt to track down the killer. They get closer and closer, and it becomes almost a game as the detectives try to prevent the next murder from occurring. There are twists and turns at every single corner up to the point where the murderer actually hands himself in, and even then you can tell that the game is barely over.It's a film with a very clear process from the beginning, but this is not a bad thing. It takes you along so you feel like you know what's going to happen next, and then subverts your expectation right at the next step. The three lead performances are all brilliant, but the standout performance is that of Spacey, whose slow speech and constant calmness turn him into such a convincing psychopath. The greatest scene in the film is in set in a car, towards the end of the film, when Spacey explains his reasoning for committing the murders. The terrifying thing about the scene is that you can, in a way, completely understand the murderer's point, and this is cemented greatly by Spacey's performance.As is to be expected from Fincher, the visuals in the film are incredible, and he doesn't waste a moment when he can shock. Each of the portrayals of the seven sins is as shocking as the next, and gluttony doesn't really kick things off that lightly. But again, Fincher's success is in disturbing his audience merely by suggestion rather than explicitly showing them anything. The murder based on lust isn't even described that graphically, but the very idea that it produces causes it to be one of the most difficult to watch scenes in the movie.In Se7en, Fincher has created a near-perfect thriller. There is not a bored moment in the entire film, and not even Gwyneth Paltrow's presence can spoil the atmosphere or enjoyment. Pitt, Freeman and Spacey complement each other perfectly, and help the film to achieve something that is actually relatively rare in movies of this genre &#x96; it actually makes your heart race.

Now he must maintain the facade for as long as he is under contract and risk alienating himself from the many friends he has who he must keep the secret from, and the new people he has now developed personal relationships with as Dorothy on the set, including his pretty and talented co-star who he has fallen deeply in love with.Michael Dorsey is a deeply complex character. To quote him, He busts his ass to get every audition right, but in the process he has become that difficult actor that directors don't wish to work with. Michael hasn't worked on a paid acting gig in a couple years, so to make ends meet he teaches an acting class, waiters at a local restaurant, and does free theater. He has celebrated a birthday and seeing himself get older and not achieve the success he thought he would have attained by now has left him feeling inadequate. He is selfish even if he insists that he never does his acting work for the great reviews. His next great venture is to get his roommate's play produced for eight thousand dollars for him and his best friend, Sandy, to star in. Michael is desperate which lends to the credibility that he would go to any lengths to book a gig and make some money. Even so far as to secretly dress up like a woman and work on a soap opera.The only two people in on Michael's secret are his quirky roommate, Jeff, (Bill Murrary) who prefers people not like his play, but rather question What happened?, and his overworked agent (Sydney Pollack) who insists that Michael seek some therapy. Sandy (Teri Garr) is an actress and Michael's best friend of six years who has her own deep seeded issues of inadequacy and insecurity. All the while longing for acceptance and insisting she receive her pain and rejection from her male lovers upfront rather than prolong the agony over a period of time. Due to some mitigating circumstances that leaves Michael caught red handed trying on some of Sandy's dresses, he lies and says he wants her sexually and she agrees. Michael never tells Sandy about him dressing up as a woman to work on a soap opera because she was up for the same exact role and was told she wasn't right for it, thus complicating the lies Michael has to make up to not see her because of his busy soap opera schedule.Dorothy Michaels is Michael's female alter ego. The talented actor that Michael is allows him to portray Dorothy with a sweet southern charm and personality, but the man that Michael is gives Dorothy a male foundation which comes across as a strong, take no nonsense kind of woman who speaks her mind. To the surprise of everyone, including Michael, Dorothy Michaels becomes a huge soap star that receives thousands of fan mail per week. Dorothy's persona positively intrigues Rita, the soap's main executive producer and befuddles Ron (Dabnet Coleman), the show's womanizing director who doesn't understand why Dorothy is not only immune to his charms, but also doesn't like him.Julie (Jessica Lange) is the talented, gorgeous single mom and the soap opera's biggest star who becomes Dorothy's best friend and confidant. She is dating Ron much to Michael's dismay, who witnesses how sexist and disrespectful Ron is towards Julie and every woman on set, much like how Michael is in his real life. All Michael\/Dorothy can do is be a friend and keep giving good advice to Julie about being a strong woman who stands up for herself, and in the process Michael falls in love with Julie. To further complicate matters, Julie's dad, Les, (Charles Durning) has developed an infatuation with Dorothy after a few meetings together and proposes marriage.During this entire process, Michael has developed a deep level of guilt at the continuous lies he is forced to commit knowing that the truth of who he is will eventually come out hurting a lot of people who trusted and cared for him. He has also learned that the man he once was wasn't always the nicest or best person to be with especially around women. In a rather fortuitous and desperate attempt at making amends, Michael\/Dorothy is forced to perform a soap scene live in front of the camera for the world to see and decides to disrobe and let the truth be known to all that he is not a woman, but in fact a man.In conclusion, Tootsie is one of those laugh out loud, touching, moving and human films that is easy to connect with and leaves you wanting to know more as the movie progresses. Everyone who got to know and interact with the Dorothy persona has become a better person including Michael. The once sad and selfish character that Michael is in the beginning of the film has become this deeper, likable and more human character by films end. One can't help but feel good that Michael and Julie do wind up together in the end because the Michael of old one would figure would have somehow ruined the relationship, while this new humbled and experienced Michael has the great potential to have a long lasting loving relationship with Julie.Tootsie stands the test of time and continues to be relevant and funny today as it was back when it first premiered in the early 1980's.

Inspector Harry Callahan is someone who is not afraid to bend the rules and overstep the line to bring criminals to justice, in some cases stopping them cold in their tracks with his Smith & Wesson Model 29 .44 Magnum revolver handgun. Along the way Inspector Callahan defies incompetent superiors to get the job done. Since Dirty Harry blasted its way onto cinemas in 1971, Harry Callahan has since became a template for a new breed of cop audiences have come to love. An antihero who is not afraid to cross professional and ethical boundaries in their fearless pursuit of their own vision of justice, especially when the law is poorly served by an inept bureaucracy and hampered by red tape. The main character finds themselves frequently reprimanded, suspended or even dismissed by superiors for their renegade actions. Dirty Harry was criticized by some critics who considered the movie to be fascist and sparked many debates about police brutality, however the film resonated with an American public that had become frustrated with increasing violent crime rates that was characteristic of the time. Dirty Harry was also a critical and commercial success, and to this day is considered to be a classic movie as well as one of Clint Eastwood's best movies.Clint Eastwood introduces us to Inspector Harry Callahan, an unorthodox homicide detective who is fearless in his pursuit of bringing criminals to justice but is willing to bend the rules and police procedure when necessary. He often butts heads with his superiors and his partners often end up wounded or killed in the line of duty. We get to see Inspector Callahan in action when he foils a bank robbery in downtown San Francisco while he is having lunch, killing two bank robbers and wounding a third. When the wounded robber reaches for his shotgun, Callahan challenges him by introducing us to the immortal line, I know what you're thinking 'Did he fire six shots or only five?' Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk? The robber wisely surrenders but tries his luck again by asking Callahan is he had one round left or if the gun was empty.Inspector Callahan has been assigned a new partner, the fresh faced Chico Gonzales (Reni Santoni) against Callahan's wishes to which Lieutenant Bressler (Harry Guardino) tells him that the order is final. Inspectors Callahan and Gonzales are tasked to take down a madman sniper calling himself Scorpio (Andrew Robinson) who has been terrorising San Francisco by killing innocent citizens with a sniper rifle and making ransom demands. The cat and mouse game takes a dangerous turn when Scorpio kidnaps a teenage girl and buries her alive along with a larger ransom demand. Inspector Callahan must stop Scorpio's reign of terror, even if it means throwing police procedure and rules out the window.Clint Eastwood previously made his mark in Westerns such as the TV show Rawhide and the classic The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (1968). In 1971, he reaches a turning point in his career with Dirty Harry, as well as being cast in further roles as a police officer. Clint Eastwood gives his take on Harry Callahan as an urban cowboy fearless and relentless in his pursuit of justice. Considering that the role of Harry Callahan perfectly fits like a glove for Clint Eastwood, it's hard to believe that many actors were considered for the role including John Wayne, Frank Sinatra, Robert Mitchum, Burt Lancaster, Steve McQueen and Paul Newman.Dirty Harry works perfectly as a hard boiled crime movie. There's no car chases, explosions, minimal action sequences, and thankfully no romantic scenes. The movie is tightly wound with no nonsense direction from Don Siegel.Dirty Harry spawned a further four sequels as well as leading the way in popular culture. Without Dirty Harry, there would be no Axel Foley from Beverly Hills Cop, no Marion Coberetti from Cobra, no Martin Riggs from Lethal Weapon, no John McClane from Die Hard, and actors such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, Wesley Snipes, Steven Seagal, and Jean Claude Van Damme feature similar characters that were strongly influenced by Clint Eastwood's Harry Callahan. There have even been TV Shows that have been inspired by Dirty Harry. 80's cop show Hunter with Fred Dryer as LAPD Detective Rick Hunter was inspired by Dirty Harry. 80's cop comedy Sledge Hammer! with David Rasche in the titular role is a parody of Dirty Harry. And in recent times, Kiefer Sutherland's Jack Bauer from 24 introduced modern day TV audiences to a more ruthless version of Harry Callahan, who is not hindered by rules and the law in his pursuit of terrorists, sometimes even torturing and murdering suspects.Dirty Harry lives on as an iconic movie, and Clint Eastwood's loose-cannon and trigger happy Inspector Harry Callahan remains as an iconic character in cinema history.9\/10.

This whoever is an alright film but almost all of the jokes don't have any kind of impact after the first watch. There's only one that got to me and that's this funny scene when Chris Farley gets mad and utters the words, Little S..T! How red his face gets is just awesome and Chris Farley was the biggest highlight of the film for me. He really knew how to make you laugh I give Chris credit for this film.

She just doesn't fit the bill. Too young. Too pretty. But truthfully - as the movie goes on, she works in the role. First, her performance was pretty good, and second, it's a movie that forces you to suspend your disbelief anyway, and so the fact that she doesn't work in the role actually makes her work in the role. If you see what I mean. Sheriff Parker has a big job on her hands. Her town is being invaded by giant spiders, grown into huge mutants by the dumping of toxic waste. There are tarantulas and jumping spiders and trapdoor spiders and all kinds of - well - eight legged freaks. (The name of the movie sums it up so well!) There's an interesting enough cast of co-stars for Wuhrer, including David Arquette as the owner of the local mine who's just returned to town, Scarlett Johansson as the sheriff's daughter Ashley, and Doug E. Doug as a guy running an outlaw radio station who believes in every conspiracy theory going.The story's fun, it's sometimes exciting and every now and then frightening - and it does have a few cringe moments as the spiders do what spiders do. Sure it's a silly movie - but I suppose that it does have barely beneath the surface a serious undertone about the environmental dangers of toxic waste. Establishing the romantic link towards the end between Arquette and Wuhrer was too predictable and too formulaic, and not at all necessary for the story. But that aside, I thought this worked pretty well.Don't take it too seriously. Just sit back and have fun with it.

It sounds a little like the plot to Fun with Dick and Jane, only neither of these two clowns is as smart as Dick or Jane, either in that movie or in the kids' books.Perry is Chris Anderson, a by-the-book cop who meets wacky, wild, wacked biker babe Pam (Judd) in a bar. He's instantly smitten; she's obviously unstable. It's true love at first sight, at least from his standpoint. Eventually, Pam comes around, and they get married. But as I've already noted twice in this paragraph, she has some mental issues. Whether it's hiding from Chris' parents when they come to visit or threatening to kill herself with one of Chris' many firearms, Pam clearly needs some kind of help. Even rehab, provoked by habitual tardiness to the research lab (!) that employs her, isn't the cure.We know within five minutes of the movie's start that this won't end well for either Chris or Pam, as they're in the process of being caught by the FBI after a robbery. The rest of the story is told in flashback, so the focus is really on how the pair got to the point of robbing banks, and successfully.Neither of the leads stands out here. Perry is almost unrecognizable, sporting a standard-issue cop mustache, and his character is alternately clever and stupid. Chris sticks by his dotty wife even when it's clear her actions are having a severely detrimental effect on his work, family, and friends. Judd fares a little better, but not much. Judd is eye candy that can actually act, and she does an acceptable job with a complex character. Still and all, Pam is so far around the bend that it's hard to relate to her. Sure, being unpredictable is generally a good trait for a character to have, but if there's not even a passing nod to coherence, then it's all for naught. You may as well have Pam twirling a hula hoop with her neck while dressed as a pirate for all the sense her character seems to have.Not much to see here, just a flat, toneless story of two unlucky saps who, frankly, got what they had coming anyway.
