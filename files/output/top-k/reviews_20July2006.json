It is also a great romance film (think of it as a Titanic for literature enthusiasts). The reason I say that is because it made Shakespeare as entertaining to see in a new generation as it was back in the 1600s. One must admit, that to an average teenager (or person, for that matter), Shakespeare is as boring as reading a tax filing instruction book. With the language and iambic pentameter (a rhythmic way of speaking with five beats for each line of Shakespeare, which is something conservative Shakespeare scholars hold dear) Shakespeare can sound like clapping with one hand. However, with Baz's creativity and style, R+J is one of the most entertaining adaptations of Shakespeare ever put on film. From the dazzling visuals to the working chemistry between Leo and Claire, Shakespeare is made fun again.A lot of people knock this version for its extreme over-the-top style and the changing of the simplest elements (changing swords to guns, use of rock music), but to make a hit, that's what you have to do to get your point across. Sure, most of the text is cut and some plot elements from the original is left out, but that does not change the true story by much (you think a teenager would want to sit through the WHOLE play on film?). You have to admit, Shakespeare's not easy to translate to the screen, so one must give Baz a lot of credit for trying and succeeding. Sure its bawdy, violent and over the top, but that's his style. You can't blame a director for using his own style to make an entertaining film. And the way he updates the details to match the era is fantastic (usage of cars, gun handling, Mercutio as a drag queen, Queen Mab as a drug, Prince as a cop, etc.). A lot of people knock the simplest changes, most often touched upon being the swords-to-guns controversy. Think about it your living in the 1990s, who's going to carry a sword? And while there are wonderful qualities, the negative ones must be briefly touched upon. The language is sometimes spoken without any sort of rhythm at all (I'm not knocking it for not using iambic pentameter, but since Shakespeare is poetic, treat it like it is poetry) and is sometimes spoken as if it were slang. Some of the actors handle it very nicely, and some just crash and burn. I must say, that I bet there were many teens in the audience scratching their heads at what everybody was talking about, but I think it's good for people to listen to movies and not just watch them. One thing I was personally annoyed by was the use of that song Pretty Piece of Flesh. It's used once in the first scene, then used again ten minutes later in a scene with the same exact people. Is that all they listen to? Other than that, there are not many negative elements to touch upon.*SPOILER WARNING*Some of the scenes are absolutely spectacular. The gas station scene is wonderfully cartoonish as it mimics a spaghetti-Western shootout, the first encounters between Romeo and Juliet are beautifully done (especially the elevator scene and the pool scene), and the rewritten final scene between Romeo and Juliet is convincing and tragic (and convincingly tragic). I was so into that scene that I was sort of yelling at the screen for Juliet to make a move to Romeo faster in order to show that she's alive. It's little things like those that helps you know how convincing the romance is between the two, and overall it was an extremely powerful and moving scene. The performances from the two are great, as well as Mercutio, Tybalt (who is played by an extremely badass Leguizamo), Friar, Nurse and Prince. This is one of my favorite films, both from the 1990s and of all time, and I hope that in the future, many more people will discover it the way I did.

It looks like a dream, it features one of my dream girls, the story is not so important at all, just like in a dream, and it also features so many metaphors along the way. The whole film is as if taken from Kislowski subconsciousness and put on celluloid. Of course there's also a motif about duality, fatherhood but what struck you first is the overall atmosphere. The cinematography is excellent, here i go, i started with it, forgive me Irene. That's what makes the film so mesmerizing and really succumbs you in it. While i was watching, i really felt i wanted to be there, to live in this world, so melancholic and magical.

And of course i mean her acting abilities too. I heard some users think of her as just a pretty face. Actually i don't think that's bad. Good film actors have to have charisma, a magnetic quality that attracts you in them so that you feel concerned and involved, i would love too see Glenn Close from the back rolls of the theater but not in a erotic thriller. And about the acting abilities - people see Al Pacino shouting at people and think that that's what is all about but it's not. Not all the people in the real world are so aggressive, passionate or so extrovert. Irene Jacob's acting is really very sublime and that's really hard. It's just that her heroine is that kind of person. I would really like to see more of her movies and to see her in new movies too.

But as they find themselves growing up, they may also be growing apart. Enid becomes closer to an older man, Seymour (Steve Buscemi), who collects old records. Rebecca, on the other hand, is turning more normal, getting a job at The Coffee Experience (a clear Starbucks ripoff) and hunting for apartments. Can their friendship survive the rift? Brad Renfro also appears as the girls' friend Josh who drives them around.Dear Josh, we came by to (sleep with) you, but you were not home. Therefore... you are gay. Signed Tiffany, and Amber. That note left in the film was so amusing, if nothing else had worked they hooked me with this scene. Of course, as you can guess by the 8 out of 10, they sold me in many other ways.And also, even if this film was a pile of dung, the cast alone would have carried it. Steve Buscemi is amazing and needs bigger roles. Thora Birch -- especially at the point -- is the ultimate heroine. And Scarlett Johannsen, before anyone really knew who she was, had appeal to audiences across the board. The way these characters interact could work for hours on end... a television series would have been perfect. And i have to say, there's nothing dung about this film -- the directing is awesome and the writing is better than most of the independent films out there. Ghost World continues the greatness that Welcome to the Dollhouse and Buffalo 66 started and seems a good inspiration for Juno.If you were an outcast in high school, you sympathize with Enid and you may even find her unconventionally attractive for her style and interests. (You have to admit the Batgirl mask is hot.) This is the girl you would have loved to be friends with in high school if you knew she existed.

Have an open mind while watching this. While the film is easily a drama, it is actually quite funny. Watch it expecting a comedy, and you'll hate it. Watch it expecting a thought- provoking drama, and you'll find it to be just that, and you'll often laugh out loud.Everyone is familiar with the story somehow. Truman (Jim Carrey) is an ordinary man, living in a town, Seahaven Island, that defines the term too perfect to be true, and he has never left it. What he doesn't realize is that the town is actually built inside a giant TV studio, and over 5000 cameras are placed within the town, broadcasting Truman's entire life as an iconic, wildly popular TV show, that plays 24\/7, and is controlled by a producer known as Christof (Ed Harris). Truman has never known that he is the most famous man alive, as every telltale sign that might reveal it is cleverly covered up by the controllers, and every one of Truman's friends and family are just actors who probably have no true compassion for Truman. The movie follows the show up until Truman's eventual discovery of his situation, and his attempts to escape.One fun thing to do after you watch this film is to watch Ace Ventura Pet Detective. This is a great way to see just how talented Jim Carrey is. He was robbed at the Oscars this year, as his performance was dead on. While he plays it straight, there is the occasional glimpse of his style of comedy, especially in a rather intense scene where he gives his wife several hints that he knows about his fake world. His behavior in that scene will provide some relief for people who were expecting a Jim Carrey laugh-fest. One thing that makes his performance in the movie better than the rest is that Jim Carrey is the only one playing a real person. Every line said by anyone else around him (besides the controllers) is staged. Everyone besides Jim are playing actors. That isn't saying that everyone else is bad. Everyone else is terrific. Truman's wife (Laura Linney) is the second best performance. She is a brilliant actress playing a suspiciously bad actress. You have to see it to believe it.In spite of all the drama, the movie is actually (subtly) hilarious. Sight gags (all related to the plot) are frequently visible, as is the behavior of everyone around Truman when they get suspicious that he knows his world is fake. Truman's wife constantly describes household products to Truman as if she were a rejected audition for a badly written commercial. Truman doesn't seem to notice this (yet). Travel agencies are filled with posters warning people of the deadly hazards of flying on an airplane. The fact that these type of sight gags are rarely acknowledged is one source of humor. Also, the thought of what's going through the actor's heads as Truman approaches them with travel plans are rather funny. The best sequence of the movie is a talk show interview with Christof, which gives us a behind the scenes look at the show, and answers many of the biggest questions we may have about the technical details of Truman's life.The combination of humor with the drama of the amazing story ultimately leaves the viewer with a lifted spirit, and looking at the world a whole new way. I recommend this thought- provoking, moving, entertaining, and arguably hilarious film to everybody and give it a 10\/10.It is rated PG for Thematic Elements and Mild Language.

I have to say again that this film is really overrated as *cough* 'classic' horror movies go and I've watched lots of them lately (from 1920s to 1980s) as I study the history of horror films. Not everything Vincent does is gold, but this is probably better than the Dr. Goldfoot film Bava was forced to make starring Vincent, a DVD which still sits unwatched on my shelf. If I want a campy film with Vincent behind a series of theme murders I'd much rather watch him again in Theater of Blood (made two years later). Some of the murders here were extremely ridiculous and unlikely -- and not in a way that entertained me. They were like something out of a bad giallo (and I've seen dozens of gialli, from the great to the downright awful). The cops in this Brit film were even more bumbling and incapable than you'd expect in an Italian giallo.I give it points for good set design, especially in Phibes art deco lair. I give it points for seemingly originating some ideas, which were obviously later revamped into the Saw movies' time limit puzzles. The last 15 minutes or so were what redeemed this film for me. The final showdown and the Phibes mask reveal were actually good but not good enough to make up for the boredom and exasperation I felt during other parts of the movie. I detract points for the annoying music sequences where I felt like a (literally) captive audience member forced to watch Price sit in the corner of the room playing with his organ. I was annoyed by the 'speaking with unmoving lips' element of Phibes character which was not stylish or atmospheric to me, but annoyingly distracting -- both Corman's and Romero's versions of Poe's M. Valdemar do the disembodied voice thing much more chillingly and effectively. Some people seem to give points for the attractive actress as Vulnavia, but I can see more attractive women in a Hammer production and they're usually part of a better film (despite Hammer's characteristic recycling of sets and typically low budgets). To put things in perspective, I'll probably give the later inferior installments of Hammer's Dracula & Frankenstein film series a second viewing long before I'll watch this DVD again.According to the trailer this might be 'the most terrifying motion picture you've ever seen'.

However, aside from the old matriarch beating everybody with a newspaper, I did not find one funny scene to laugh at.I won't criticize the acting because the performers do a fine job in their acting abilities. But, the story is unbelievable by American contemporary standards. I can't conceive of any American family which would relegate themselves to such constant misery by living on a farm what is falling apart. The characters would have left the farm for the city long ago and Robert Poste's child would have showed up to a half-empty farm. Likewise, the characters are too dirty living. Unwashed faces, dirty clothes never cleaned all make for an interesting scene if it were a war movie with the people in the mud in combat.

Young guy trying to make it in the business world, getting sidetracked as an ace bartender and learning about relationships. The acting is good, especially Bryan Browne. But what ruins this movie for me is Tom Cruise. I'm just not a fan of his acting style.In Cocktail, Cruise plays an arrogant bartender, so sure of himself that he seems to ooze smarminess. Very much like his portrayal of the arrogant pilot in Top Gun, or the arrogant pool player in the Color of Money, or the arrogant fighter in Far an Away, or the arrogant vampire in Interview with the Vampire, or the arrogant agent in Jerry Maguire.I'm sensing a pattern here. And his arrogant interview, as himself, when questioned by Matt Lauer on Today, seems to suggest that Cruise wasn't really acting in those films, he was just being himself. So I am turned off by any film that features Tom Cruise. Folks who like him will love Cocktail. Folks who are not impressed by his arrogance will hate it.One side note about Cocktail we see Cruise and Browne as bartenders in a trendy club, packed with patrons who are lined up 3 or 4 deep all around the bar as the sound system blares tunes. I can only imagine how long it would take to get your drink with only those 2 bartenders working. And that's if they were quick about it. But Cruise and Browne make the drinks while engaged in synchronized dance-type movements, tossing the glasses and the bottles in the air and to each other. I figure it would take about 3 minutes (the average length of the songs they were performing to) for each drink to be served. So quite a few of those patrons lined up around the bar would be waiting at least a half hour or more before they got their drink. I'd rather have a less entertaining bartender who could serve the drinks quickly. Also interesting is that in the scene when Cruise takes a swing at Browne behind the bar, in the midst of all those people, the entire club immediately falls so quiet you could hear a pin drop, so that there is no noise other than Cruise talking to Browne. What happened to the music? There was no band to stop playing. So why did the sound system cut out at that precise moment? Cocktail would have been a much better movie without Tom Cruise.

His end-of-film, wedding kitchen tirade (Hey!!!!!........) is more than enough to almost scare and stop any viewer short, as it certainly does Eli in that scene. This guy is one hell of an actor......why haven't we since seen a lot more of him? (The curse of playing a gay role, the hex of giving us such an intense guy-on-guy bedroom scene; is there such a jinx as this?) Yet it is in Eli's control freak behavior that lies Tom's salvation.

At movie's end we find our struggling duo sitting and conversing in a garden, when all of a sudden you can see in their eyes and faces---as if the proverbial light bulb's been turned on---each one realizing that they have in the other what they've been needing and wanting all along. What a great heart-swelling moment for us, eh?PPS--You're missing out on a really good insider's comment on this movie if you haven't read the one by keithla43 (from Culver City, CA), posted at this site on 20 May 2003, under the comment title, Classic love story. **** ","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"20 July 2006","score":"","review":" how can anyone berate a movie so funny., give me a break.

Night Shyamalan has a knack for making some really good movies and some really bad movies. Although The Sixth Sense was a very entertaining thriller, M. Night Shyamalan's Signs is overall a better film, and it could be one of the best alien films of all time.Graham Hess lives with his two children and his brother on a farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. As if losing his wife in a car accident wasn't enough devastation for his family, they are told that the strange formations being found in their crop circles are the work of aliens, looking to invade our planet. Although skeptical at first, Graham slowly figures out that the world really is being invaded, and that he and his family could very well be near their deaths....The film wastes no time in getting the story started. Less than five minutes into the movie, the crop circles are already there and the authorities are notified. Yet the film still manages to spend enough time with the characters for us to get to know them well and for us to really care about them. Shymalan proves that he is a master at keeping the tension going throughout the whole film, even when its pitch-black or dead-silent. He even manages to add in some pretty funny moments to the film. The acting is generally well-done, from Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix to even the child actors.Some people are not going to like the film's ending, for whatever reason. Some may not like the fact that we actually get to see the aliens at point-blank range, while others may not like the aliens' weakness. I feel a little bit of both, but they're very minor things when looking at the film as a whole.Signs is probably the best alien film I have ever seen (apart from Men In Black), and is so close to being a four-star film in my book. Its one of the few films I have ever seen (probably the only one) that has actually terrified me just because of its realism. Everything about it is just that close to perfection. Its not an alien movie just for science-fiction fans, its a high-stakes drama for anyone.Rating ***1\/2 P.S. When the newscaster on the television says that the footage may be disturbing, believe her.

But, fortunately, both are also exceptional films and have very different endings. In general, this movie is a little more polished, while THEY WON'T BELIEVE ME is a little wilder and more entertaining--especially the ending. It turns out A PLACE IN THE SUN is the older of the two stories, having been filmed in 1931 as AN American TRAGEDY. Montgomery Clift, Shelly Winters and Liz Taylor all star in this long and very satisfying film. Supposedly nice-guy Clift is a poor fella who goes across country to work for his uncle's company. He is started at the very bottom and strikes up a romance with Winters--who eventually becomes pregnant! A bit later, he is moved up the company ladder and begins to socialize with his uncle's country club friends--where he gets to know Liz. He and Liz fall for each other. Marriage to her would mean the sweet life, but honoring his obligation to Winters would destroy all his plans for success. So, he considers killing Winters. What happens next is pretty unexpected (provided you didn't see the other film first) and the story has a lot of amazing twists and turns that make it a must-see film. The acting, writing, direction and nice location scenery really all come together nicely in this suspense film.

Again, it sounds over like you've seen it before, but certain things here you won't see elsewhere. Things I can't say without giving away later parts of the film. But I can say it crosses a line where if you are easily offended or are very patriotic, you might get a little steamed.The acting? Fine, for a comedy. The plot, decent. The writing, quite good. The music was surprisingly good. There was, of course, a great deal of rap music. But other kinds of music were incorporated to round the feel of the movie out. I even heard Rammstein, which would seem out of place but really wasn't.Oh, and Lark Voorhies (Saved by the Bell) co-stars, which would make this the second greatest college film to star a SBTB alumnus (the best being Dead Man on Campus).I would recommend this film.
